His home\r\nwithout one was like an empty temple in which there is no altar, no\r\noffering. So keenly did he realize the necessity that a dozen times at\r\nleast during the past year he had been on the point of proposing\r\nmarriage to almost as many different young women of the neighborhood.\r\nTherein lay the difficulty, the trouble which Tel\xc3\xa8sphore experienced in\r\nmaking up his mind. Elvina\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were beautiful and had often tempted\r\nhim to the verge of a declaration. But her skin was over swarthy for a\r\nwife; and her movements were slow and heavy; he doubted she had Indian\r\nblood, and we all know what Indian blood is for treachery. Amaranthe\r\npresented in her person none of these obstacles to matrimony. If her\r\neyes were not so handsome as Elvina\xe2\x80\x99s, her skin was fine, and being\r\nslender to a fault, she moved swiftly about her household affairs, or\r\nwhen she walked the country lanes in going to church or to the store.\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore had once reached the point of believing that Amaranthe would\r\nmake him an excellent wife. He had even started out one day with the\r\nintention of declaring himself, when, as the god of chance would have\r\nit, Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Valtour espied him passing in the road and enticed him to\r\nenter and partake of coffee and \xe2\x80\x9cbaign\xc3\xa9s.\xe2\x80\x9d He would have been a man of\r\nstone to have resisted, or to have remained insensible to the charms and\r\naccomplishments of the Valtour girls. Finally there was Ganache\xe2\x80\x99s widow,\r\nseductive rather than handsome, with a good bit of property in her own\r\nright. While Tel\xc3\xa8sphore was considering his chances of happiness or even\r\nsuccess with Ganache\xe2\x80\x99s widow, she married a younger man.\r\n\r\nFrom these embarrassing conditions, Tel\xc3\xa8sphore sometimes felt himself\r\nforced to escape; to change his environment for a day or two and thereby\r\ngain a few new insights by shifting his point of view.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday morning that he decided to spend Sunday in the vicinity\r\nof Marksville, and the same afternoon found him waiting at the country\r\nstation for the south-bound train.\r\n\r\nHe was a robust young fellow with good, strong features and a somewhat\r\ndetermined expression--despite his vacillations in the choice of a wife.\r\nHe was dressed rather carefully in navy-blue \xe2\x80\x9cstore clothes\xe2\x80\x9d that fitted\r\nwell because anything would have fitted Tel\xc3\xa8sphore. He had been freshly\r\nshaved and trimmed and carried an umbrella. He wore\xe2\x80\x94a little tilted over\r\none eye\xe2\x80\x94a straw hat in preference to the conventional gray felt; for no\r\nother reason than that his uncle Tel\xc3\xa8sphore would have worn a felt, and\r\na battered one at that. His whole conduct of life had been planned on\r\nlines in direct contradistinction to those of his uncle Tel\xc3\xa8sphore, whom\r\nhe was thought in early youth to greatly resemble. The elder Tel\xc3\xa8sphore\r\ncould not read nor write, therefore the younger had made it the object\r\nof his existence to acquire these accomplishments. The uncle pursued the\r\navocations of hunting, fishing and moss-picking; employments which the\r\nnephew held in detestation. And as for carrying an umbrella, \xe2\x80\x9cNonc\xe2\x80\x9c\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore would have walked the length of the parish in a deluge before\r\nhe would have so much as thought of one. In short, Tel\xc3\xa8sphore, by\r\nadvisedly shaping his course in direct opposition to that of his uncle,\r\nmanaged to lead a rather orderly, industrious, and respectable\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIt was a little warm for April but the car was not uncomfortably crowded\r\nand Tel\xc3\xa8sphore was fortunate enough to secure the last available\r\nwindow-seat on the shady side. He was not too familiar with railway\r\ntravel, his expeditions being usually made on horse-back or in a buggy,\r\nand the short trip promised to interest him.\r\n\r\nThere was no one present whom he knew well enough to speak to: the\r\ndistrict attorney, whom he knew by sight, a French priest from\r\nNatchitoches and a few faces that were familiar only because they were\r\nnative.\r\n\r\nBut he did not greatly care to speak to anyone. There was a fair stand\r\nof cotton and corn in the fields and Tel\xc3\xa8sphore gathered satisfaction in\r\nsilent contemplation of the crops, comparing them with his own.\r\n\r\nIt was toward the close of his journey that a young girl boarded the\r\ntrain. There had been girls getting on and off at intervals and it was\r\nperhaps because of the bustle attending her arrival that this one\r\nattracted Tel\xc3\xa8sphore\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\r\n\r\nShe called good-bye to her father from the platform and waved good-bye\r\nto him through the dusty, sun-lit window pane after entering, for she\r\nwas compelled to seat herself on the sunny side. She seemed inwardly\r\nexcited and preoccupied save for the attention which she lavished upon a\r\nlarge parcel that she carried religiously and laid reverentially down\r\nupon the seat before her.\r\n\r\nShe was neither tall nor short, nor stout nor slender; nor was she\r\nbeautiful, nor was she plain. She wore a figured lawn, cut a little low\r\nin the back, that exposed a round, soft nuque with a few little clinging\r\ncirclets of soft, brown hair. Her hat was of white straw, cocked up on\r\nthe side with a bunch of pansies, and she wore gray lisle-thread gloves.\r\nThe girl seemed very warm and kept mopping her face. She vainly sought\r\nher fan, then she fanned herself with her handkerchief, and finally made\r\nan attempt to open the window. She might as well have tried to move the\r\nbanks of Red river.\r\n\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore had been unconsciously watching her the whole time and\r\nperceiving her straight he arose and went to her assistance. But the\r\nwindow could not be opened. When he had grown red in the face and wasted\r\nan amount of energy that would have driven the plow for a day, he\r\noffered her his seat on the shady side. She demurred\xe2\x80\x94there would be no\r\nroom for the bundle. He suggested that the bundle be left where it was\r\nand agreed to assist her in keeping an eye upon it. She accepted\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore\xe2\x80\x99s place at the shady window and he seated himself beside her.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if she would speak to him. He feared she might have mistaken\r\nhim for a Western drummer, in which event he knew that she would not;\r\nfor the women of the country caution their daughters against speaking to\r\nstrangers on the trains. But the girl was not one to mistake an Acadian\r\nfarmer for a Western traveling man. She was not born in Avoyelles parish\r\nfor nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 want anything to happen to it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right w\xe2\x80\x99ere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he assured her, following the direction of\r\nher glance, that was fastened upon the bundle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe las\xe2\x80\x99 time I came over to Foch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s ball I got caught in the rain on\r\nmy way up to my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s house, an\xe2\x80\x99 my dress! J\xe2\x80\x99 vous r\xc3\xa9ponds! it was a\r\nsight. Li\xe2\x80\x99le mo\xe2\x80\x99, I would miss the ball. As it was, the dress looked\r\nlike I\xe2\x80\x99d wo\xe2\x80\x99 it weeks without doin\xe2\x80\x99-up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear of rain to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he reassured her, glancing out at the sky,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut you can have my umbrella if it does rain; you jus\xe2\x80\x99 as well take it\r\nas not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! I wrap\xe2\x80\x99 the dress roun\xe2\x80\x99 in toile-cir\xc3\xa9e this time. You goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nFoch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s ball? Didn\xe2\x80\x99 I meet you once yonda on Bayou Derbanne? Looks like\r\nI know yo\xe2\x80\x99 face. You mus\xe2\x80\x99 come f\xe2\x80\x99om Natchitoches pa\xe2\x80\x99ish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy cousins, the F\xc3\xa9deau family, live yonda. Me, I live on my own place\r\nin Rapides since \xe2\x80\x9992.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered if she would follow up her inquiry relative to Foch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s ball.\r\nIf she did, he was ready with an answer, for he had decided to go to the\r\nball. But her thoughts evidently wandered from the subject and were\r\noccupied with matters that did not concern him, for she turned away and\r\ngazed silently out of the window.\r\n\r\nIt was not a village; it was not even a hamlet at which they descended.\r\nThe station was set down upon the edge of a cotton field. Near at hand\r\nwas the post office and store; there was a section house; there were a\r\nfew cabins at wide intervals, and one in the distance the girl informed\r\nhim was the home of her cousin, Jules Trodon. There lay a good bit of\r\nroad before them and she did not hesitate to accept Tel\xc3\xa8sphore\xe2\x80\x99s offer\r\nto bear her bundle on the way.\r\n\r\nShe carried herself boldly and stepped out freely and easily, like a\r\nnegress. There was an absence of reserve in her manner; yet there was no\r\nlack of womanliness. She had the air of a young person accustomed to\r\ndecide for herself and for those about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said yo\xe2\x80\x99 name was F\xc3\xa9deau?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, looking squarely at\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore. Her eyes were penetrating\xe2\x80\x94not sharply penetrating, but\r\nearnest and dark, and a little searching. He noticed that they were\r\nhandsome eyes; not so large as Elvina\xe2\x80\x99s, but finer in their expression.\r\nThey started to walk down the track before turning into the lane leading\r\nto Trodon\xe2\x80\x99s house. The sun was sinking and the air was fresh and\r\ninvigorating by contrast with the stifling atmosphere of the train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said yo\xe2\x80\x99 name was F\xc3\xa9deau?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Tel\xc3\xa8sphore Baquette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 my name; it\xe2\x80\x99s Za\xc3\xafda Trodon. It looks like you ought to know me; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99 know w\xe2\x80\x99y.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks that way to me, somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. They were satisfied to\r\nrecognize this feeling\xe2\x80\x94almost conviction\xe2\x80\x94of pre-acquaintance, without\r\ntrying to penetrate its cause.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached Trodon\xe2\x80\x99s house he knew that she lived over on\r\nBayou de Glaize with her parents and a number of younger brothers and\r\nsisters. It was rather dull where they lived and she often came to lend\r\na hand when her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s wife got tangled in domestic complications; or,\r\nas she was doing now, when Foch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday ball promised to be\r\nunusually important and brilliant. There would be people there even from\r\nMarksville, she thought; there were often gentlemen from Alexandria.\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore was as unreserved as she, and they appeared like old\r\nacquaintances when they reached Trodon\xe2\x80\x99s gate.\r\n\r\nTrodon\xe2\x80\x99s wife was standing on the gallery with a baby in her arms,\r\nwatching for Za\xc3\xafda; and four little bare-footed children were sitting in\r\na row on the step, also waiting; but terrified and struck motionless and\r\ndumb at sight of a stranger. He opened the gate for the girl but stayed\r\noutside himself. Za\xc3\xafda presented him formally to her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who\r\ninsisted upon his entering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, b\xe2\x80\x99en, pour \xc3\xa7a! you got to come in. It\xe2\x80\x99s any sense you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to walk\r\nyonda to Foch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s! Ti Jules, run call yo\xe2\x80\x99 pa.\xe2\x80\x9d As if Ti Jules could have\r\nrun or walked even, or moved a muscle!\r\n\r\nBut Tel\xc3\xa8sphore was firm. He drew forth his silver watch and looked at it\r\nin a business-like fashion. He always carried a watch; his uncle\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore always told the time by the sun, or by instinct, like an\r\nanimal. He was quite determined to walk on to Foch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s, a couple of miles\r\naway, where he expected to secure supper and a lodging, as well as the\r\npleasing distraction of the ball.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I reckon I see you all to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered in cheerful\r\nanticipation as he moved away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see Za\xc3\xafda; yes, an\xe2\x80\x99 Jules,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Trodon\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\ngood-humoredly. \xe2\x80\x9cMe, I got no time to fool with balls, J\xe2\x80\x99 vous r\xc3\xa9ponds!\r\nwith all them chil\xe2\x80\x99ren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s good-lookin\xe2\x80\x99; yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, when Tel\xc3\xa8sphore was out of\r\near-shot. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 dressed! it\xe2\x80\x99s like a prince. I didn\xe2\x80\x99 know you knew any\r\nBaquettes, you, Za\xc3\xafda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s strange you don\xe2\x80\x99 know \xe2\x80\x99em yo\xe2\x80\x99 se\xe2\x80\x99f, cousine.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, there had been\r\nno question from Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Trodon, so why should there be an answer from\r\nZa\xc3\xafda?\r\n\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore wondered as he walked why he had not accepted the invitation\r\nto enter. He was not regretting it; he was simply wondering what could\r\nhave induced him to decline. For it surely would have been agreeable to\r\nsit there on the gallery waiting while Za\xc3\xafda prepared herself for the\r\ndance; to have partaken of supper with the family and afterward\r\naccompanied them to Foch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s. The whole situation was so novel, and had\r\npresented itself so unexpectedly that Tel\xc3\xa8sphore wished in reality to\r\nbecome acquainted with it, accustomed to it. He wanted to view it from\r\nthis side and that in comparison with other, familiar situations. The\r\ngirl had impressed him\xe2\x80\x94affected him in some way; but in some new,\r\nunusual way, not as the others always had. He could not recall details\r\nof her personality as he could recall such details of Amaranthe or the\r\nValtours, of any of them. When Tel\xc3\xa8sphore tried to think of her he could\r\nnot think at all. He seemed to have absorbed her in some way and his\r\nbrain was not so occupied with her as his senses were. At that moment he\r\nwas looking forward to the ball; there was no doubt about that.\r\nAfterwards, he did not know what he would look forward to; he did not\r\ncare; afterward made no difference. If he had expected the crash of doom\r\nto come after the dance at Foch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s, he would only have smiled in his\r\nthankfulness that it was not to come before.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was the same scene every Saturday at Foch\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s! A scene to have\r\naroused the guardians of the peace in a locality where such commodities\r\nabound. And all on account of the mammoth pot of gumbo that bubbled,\r\nbubbled, bubbled out in the open air. Foch\xc3\xa9 in shirt-sleeves, fat, red\r\nand enraged, swore and reviled, and stormed at old black Dout\xc3\xa9 for her\r\nextravagance. He called her every kind of a name of every kind of animal\r\nthat suggested itself to his lurid imagination. And every fresh\r\ninvective that he fired at her she hurled it back at him while into the\r\npot went the chickens and the pans-full of minced ham, and the\r\nfists-full of onion and sage and piment rouge and piment vert. If he\r\nwanted her to cook for pigs he had only to say so. She knew how to cook\r\nfor pigs and she knew how to cook for people of les Avoyelles.\r\n\r\nThe gumbo smelled good, and Tel\xc3\xa8sphore would have liked a taste of it.\r\nDout\xc3\xa9 was dragging from the fire a stick of wood that Foch\xc3\xa9 had\r\nofficiously thrust beneath the simmering pot, and she muttered as she\r\nhurled it smouldering to one side:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVaux mieux y s\xe2\x80\x99m\xc3\xa9le ces affairs, lui; si non!\xe2\x80\x9d But she was all courtesy\r\nas she dipped a steaming plate for Tel\xc3\xa8sphore; though she assured him it\r\nwould not be fit for a Christian or a gentleman to taste till midnight.\r\n\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore having brushed, \xe2\x80\x9cspruced\xe2\x80\x9d and refreshed himself, strolled\r\nabout, taking a view of the surroundings. The house, big, bulky and\r\nweather-beaten, consisted chiefly of galleries in every stage of\r\ndecrepitude and dilapidation. There were a few chinaberry trees and a\r\nspreading live oak in the yard. Along the edge of the fence, a good\r\ndistance away, was a line of gnarled and distorted mulberry trees; and\r\nit was there, out in the road, that the people who came to the ball tied\r\ntheir ponies, their wagons and carts.\r\n\r\nDusk was beginning to fall and Tel\xc3\xa8sphore, looking out across the\r\nprairie, could see them coming from all directions. The little Creole\r\nponies galloping in a line looked like hobby horses in the faint\r\ndistance; the mule-carts were like toy wagons. Za\xc3\xafda might be among\r\nthose people approaching, flying, crawling ahead of the darkness that\r\nwas creeping out of the far wood. He hoped so, but he did not believe\r\nso; she would hardly have had time to dress.\r\n\r\nFoch\xc3\xa9 was noisily lighting lamps, with the assistance of an inoffensive\r\nmulatto boy whom he intended in the morning to butcher, to cut into\r\nsections, to pack and salt down in a barrel, like the Colfax woman did\r\nto her old husband\xe2\x80\x94a fitting destiny for so stupid a pig as the mulatto\r\nboy. The negro musicians had arrived: two fiddlers and an accordion\r\nplayer, and they were drinking whiskey from a black quart bottle which\r\nwas passed socially from one to the other. The musicians were really\r\nnever at their best till the quart bottle had been consumed.\r\n\r\nThe girls who came in wagons and on ponies from a distance wore, for the\r\nmost part, calico dresses and sun-bonnets. Their finery they brought\r\nalong in pillow-slips or pinned up in sheets and towels. With these they\r\nat once retired to an upper room; later to appear be-ribboned and\r\nbe-furbelowed; their faces masked with starch powder, but never a touch\r\nof rouge.\r\n\r\nMost of the guests had assembled when Za\xc3\xafda arrived\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdashed up\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\nbetter express her coming\xe2\x80\x94in an open, two-seated buckboard, with her\r\ncousin Jules driving. He reined the pony suddenly and viciously before\r\nthe time-eaten front steps, in order to produce an impression upon those\r\nwho were gathered around. Most of the men had halted their vehicles\r\noutside and permitted their women folk to walk up from the mulberry\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nBut the real, the stunning effect was produced when Za\xc3\xafda stepped upon\r\nthe gallery and threw aside her light shawl in the full glare of half a\r\ndozen kerosene lamps. She was white from head to foot\xe2\x80\x94literally, for her\r\nslippers even were white. No one would have believed, let alone\r\nsuspected that they were a pair of old black ones which she had covered\r\nwith pieces of her first communion sash. There is no describing her\r\ndress, it was fluffy, like a fresh powder-puff, and stood out. No wonder\r\nshe had handled it so reverentially! Her white fan was covered with\r\nspangles that she herself had sewed all over it; and in her belt and in\r\nher brown hair were thrust small sprays of orange blossom.\r\n\r\nTwo men leaning against the railing uttered long whistles expressive\r\nequally of wonder and admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTiens! t\xe2\x80\x99es pareille comme ain mari\xc3\xa9e, Za\xc3\xafda;\xe2\x80\x9d cried out a lady with a\r\nbaby in her arms. Some young women tittered and Za\xc3\xafda fanned herself.\r\nThe women\xe2\x80\x99s voices were almost without exception shrill and piercing;\r\nthe men\xe2\x80\x99s, soft and low-pitched.\r\n\r\nThe girl turned to Tel\xc3\xa8sphore, as to an old and valued friend:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTiens! c\xe2\x80\x99est vous?\xe2\x80\x9d He had hesitated at first to approach, but at this\r\nfriendly sign of recognition he drew eagerly forward and held out his\r\nhand. The men looked at him suspiciously, inwardly resenting his stylish\r\nappearance, which they considered intrusive, offensive and demoralizing.\r\n\r\nHow Za\xc3\xafda\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled now! What very pretty teeth Za\xc3\xafda had when she\r\nlaughed, and what a mouth! Her lips were a revelation, a promise;\r\nsomething to carry away and remember in the night and grow hungry\r\nthinking of next day. Strictly speaking, they may not have been quite\r\nall that; but in any event, that is the way Tel\xc3\xa8sphore thought about\r\nthem. He began to take account of her appearance: her nose, her eyes,\r\nher hair. And when she left him to go in and dance her first dance with\r\ncousin Jules, he leaned up against a post and thought of them: nose,\r\neyes, hair, ears, lips and round, soft throat.\r\n\r\nLater it was like Bedlam.\r\n\r\nThe musicians had warmed up and were scraping away indoors and calling\r\nthe figures. Feet were pounding through the dance; dust was flying. The\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s voices were piped high and mingled discordantly, like the\r\nconfused, shrill clatter of waking birds, while the men laughed\r\nboisterously. But if some one had only thought of gagging Foch\xc3\xa9, there\r\nwould have been less noise. His good humor permeated everywhere, like an\r\natmosphere. He was louder than all the noise; he was more visible than\r\nthe dust. He called the young mulatto (destined for the knife) \xe2\x80\x9cmy boy\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand sent him flying hither and thither. He beamed upon Dout\xc3\xa9 as he\r\ntasted the gumbo and congratulated her: \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est toi qui s\xe2\x80\x99y connais, ma\r\nfille! \xe2\x80\x99cr\xc3\xa9 tonnerre!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore danced with Za\xc3\xafda and then he leaned out against the post;\r\nthen he danced with Za\xc3\xafda, and then he leaned against the post. The\r\nmothers of the other girls decided that he had the manners of a pig.\r\n\r\nIt was time to dance again with Za\xc3\xafda and he went in search of her. He\r\nwas carrying her shawl, which she had given him to hold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at time it is?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked him when he had found and secured her. They\r\nwere under one of the kerosene lamps on the front gallery and he drew\r\nforth his silver watch. She seemed to be still laboring under some\r\nsuppressed excitement that he had noticed before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fo\xe2\x80\x99teen minutes pas\xe2\x80\x99 twelve,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her exactly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d fine out w\xe2\x80\x99ere Jules is. Go look yonda in the card-room if\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s there, an\xe2\x80\x99 come tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d Jules had danced with all the prettiest\r\ngirls. She knew it was his custom after accomplishing this agreeable\r\nfeat, to retire to the card-room,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll wait yere till I come back?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait yere; you go on.\xe2\x80\x9d She waited but drew back a little into the\r\nshadow. Tel\xc3\xa8sphore lost no time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s yonda playin\xe2\x80\x99 cards with Foch\xc3\xa9 an\xe2\x80\x99 some others I don\xe2\x80\x99 know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe reported when he had discovered her in the shadow. There had been a\r\nspasm of alarm when he did not at once see her where he had left her\r\nunder the lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he look\xe2\x80\x94look like he\xe2\x80\x99s fixed yonda fo\xe2\x80\x99 good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got his coat off. Looks like he\xe2\x80\x99s fixed pretty comf\xe2\x80\x99table fo\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nnex\xe2\x80\x99 hour or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGi\xe2\x80\x99 me my shawl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cole?\xe2\x80\x9d offering to put it around her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t cole.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew the shawl about her shoulders and turned as\r\nif to leave him. But a sudden generous impulse seemed to move her, and\r\nshe added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along yonda with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey descended the few rickety steps that led down to the yard. He\r\nfollowed rather than accompanied her across the beaten and trampled\r\nsward. Those who saw them thought they had gone out to take the air. The\r\nbeams of light that slanted out from the house were fitful and\r\nuncertain, deepening the shadows. The embers under the empty gumbo-pot\r\nglared red in the darkness. There was a sound of quiet voices coming\r\nfrom under the trees.\r\n\r\nZa\xc3\xafda, closely accompanied by Tel\xc3\xa8sphore, went out where the vehicles\r\nand horses were fastened to the fence. She stepped carefully and held up\r\nher skirts as if dreading the least speck of dew or of dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhitch Jules\xe2\x80\x99 ho\xe2\x80\x99se an\xe2\x80\x99 buggy there an\xe2\x80\x99 turn \xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x99roun\xe2\x80\x99 this way,\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d He did as instructed, first backing the pony, then leading it\r\nout to where she stood in the half-made road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou goin\xe2\x80\x99 home?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked her, \xe2\x80\x9cbetta let me water the pony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeva mine.\xe2\x80\x9d She mounted and seating herself grasped the reins. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\r\naint goin\xe2\x80\x99 home,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. He, too, was holding the reins gathered in\r\none hand across the pony\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99ere you goin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeva you mine w\xe2\x80\x99ere I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 anyw\xe2\x80\x99ere this time o\xe2\x80\x99 night by yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at you reckon I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99fraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cTurn loose that ho\xe2\x80\x99se,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nat the same time urging the animal forward. The little brute started\r\naway with a bound and Tel\xc3\xa8sphore, also with a bound, sprang into the\r\nbuckboard and seated himself beside Za\xc3\xafda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 anyw\xe2\x80\x99ere this time o\xe2\x80\x99 night by yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f.\xe2\x80\x9d It was not a\r\nquestion now, but an assertion, and there was no denying it. There was\r\neven no disputing it, and Za\xc3\xafda recognizing the fact drove on in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThere is no animal that moves so swiftly across a \xe2\x80\x99Cadian prairie as the\r\nlittle Creole pony. This one did not run nor trot; he seemed to reach\r\nout in galloping bounds. The buckboard creaked, bounced, jolted and\r\nswayed. Za\xc3\xafda clutched at her shawl while Tel\xc3\xa8sphore drew his straw hat\r\nfurther down over his right eye and offered to drive. But he did not\r\nknow the road and she would not let him. They had soon reached the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nIf there is any animal that can creep more slowly through a wooded road\r\nthan the little Creole pony, that animal has not yet been discovered in\r\nAcadie. This particular animal seemed to be appalled by the darkness of\r\nthe forest and filled with dejection. His head drooped and he lifted his\r\nfeet as if each hoof were weighted with a thousand pounds of lead. Any\r\none unacquainted with the peculiarities of the breed would sometimes\r\nhave fancied that he was standing still. But Za\xc3\xafda and Tel\xc3\xa8sphore knew\r\nbetter. Za\xc3\xafda uttered a deep sigh as she slackened her hold on the reins\r\nand Tel\xc3\xa8sphore, lifting his hat, let it swing from the back of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you don\xe2\x80\x99 ask me w\xe2\x80\x99ere I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she said finally. These were the\r\nfirst words she had spoken since refusing his offer to drive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it don\xe2\x80\x99 make any diff\xe2\x80\x99ence w\xe2\x80\x99ere you goin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if it don\xe2\x80\x99 make any diff\xe2\x80\x99ence w\xe2\x80\x99ere I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99, I jus\xe2\x80\x99 as well tell\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated, however. He seemed to have no curiosity and did not\r\nurge her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get married,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe uttered some kind of an exclamation; it was nothing articulate\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nlike the tone of an animal that gets a sudden knife thrust. And now he\r\nfelt how dark the forest was. An instant before it had seemed a sweet,\r\nblack paradise; better than any heaven he had ever heard of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99y can\xe2\x80\x99t you get married at home?\xe2\x80\x9d This was not the first thing that\r\noccurred to him to say, but this was the first thing he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, b\xe2\x80\x99en oui! with perfec\xe2\x80\x99 mules fo\xe2\x80\x99 a father an\xe2\x80\x99 mother! it\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nenough to talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99y couldn\xe2\x80\x99 he come an\xe2\x80\x99 get you? W\xe2\x80\x99at kine of a scound\xe2\x80\x99el is that to\r\nlet you go through the woods at night by yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou betta wait till you know who you talkin\xe2\x80\x99 about. He didn\xe2\x80\x99 come an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nget me because he knows I ain\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99fraid; an\xe2\x80\x99 because he\xe2\x80\x99s got too much\r\npride to ride in Jules Trodon\xe2\x80\x99s buckboard afta he done been put out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nJules Trodon\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s his name an\xe2\x80\x99 w\xe2\x80\x99ere you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to fine \xe2\x80\x99im?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonda on the other side the woods up at ole Wat Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a kine of\r\njustice the peace or something. Anyhow he\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to marry us. An\xe2\x80\x99 afta\r\nwe done married those t\xc3\xaates-de-mulets yonda on bayou de Glaize can say\r\nw\xe2\x80\x99at they want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndr\xc3\xa9 Pascal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe name meant nothing to Tel\xc3\xa8sphore. For all he knew, Andr\xc3\xa9 Pascal\r\nmight be one of the shining lights of Avoyelles; but he doubted it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou betta turn \xe2\x80\x99roun\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. It was an unselfish impulse that\r\nprompted the suggestion. It was the thought of this girl married to a\r\nman whom even Jules Trodon would not suffer to enter his house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI done give my word,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s the matta with \xe2\x80\x99im? W\xe2\x80\x99y don\xe2\x80\x99t yo\xe2\x80\x99 father and mother want you to\r\nmarry \xe2\x80\x99im?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99y? Because it\xe2\x80\x99s always the same tune! W\xe2\x80\x99en a man\xe2\x80\x99s down eve\xe2\x80\x99ybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot stones to throw at \xe2\x80\x99im. They say he\xe2\x80\x99s lazy. A man that will walk\r\nfrom St. Landry plumb to Rapides lookin\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99 work; an\xe2\x80\x99 they call that\r\nlazy! Then, somebody\xe2\x80\x99s been spreadin\xe2\x80\x99 yonda on the Bayou that he drinks.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99lieve it. I neva saw \xe2\x80\x99im drinkin\xe2\x80\x99, me. Anyway, he won\xe2\x80\x99t drink\r\nafta he\xe2\x80\x99s married to me; he\xe2\x80\x99s too fon\xe2\x80\x99 of me fo\xe2\x80\x99 that. He say he\xe2\x80\x99ll blow\r\nout his brains if I don\xe2\x80\x99 marry \xe2\x80\x99im.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you betta turn roun\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I done give my word.\xe2\x80\x9d And they went creeping on through the woods\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at time is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked after an interval. He lit a match and\r\nlooked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quarta to one. W\xe2\x80\x99at time did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tole \xe2\x80\x99im I\xe2\x80\x99d come about one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I knew that was a good time to\r\nget away f\xe2\x80\x99om the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would have hurried a little but the pony could not be induced to do\r\nso. He dragged himself, seemingly ready at any moment to give up the\r\nbreath of life. But once out of the woods he made up for lost time. They\r\nwere on the open prairie again, and he fairly ripped the air; some\r\nflying demon must have changed skins with him.\r\n\r\nIt was a few minutes of one o\xe2\x80\x99clock when they drew up before Wat\r\nGibson\xe2\x80\x99s house. It was not much more than a rude shelter, and in the dim\r\nstarlight it seemed isolated, as if standing alone in the middle of the\r\nblack, far-reaching prairie. As they halted at the gate a dog within set\r\nup a furious barking; and an old negro who had been smoking his pipe at\r\nthat ghostly hour, advanced toward them from the shelter of the gallery.\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore descended and helped his companion to alight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to see Mr. Gibson,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke up Za\xc3\xafda. The old fellow had already\r\nopened the gate. There was no light in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarse Gibson, he yonda to ole Mr. Bodel\xe2\x80\x99s playin\xe2\x80\x99 kairds. But he neva\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstay atter one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Come in, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; come in, suh; walk right \xe2\x80\x99long\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d He had drawn his own conclusions to explain their appearance. They\r\nstood upon the narrow porch waiting while he went inside to light the\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\nAlthough the house was small, as it comprised but one room, that room\r\nwas comparatively a large one. It looked to Tel\xc3\xa8sphore and Za\xc3\xafda very\r\nlarge and gloomy when they entered it. The lamp was on a table that\r\nstood against the wall, and that held further a rusty looking ink\r\nbottle, a pen and an old blank book. A narrow bed was off in the corner.\r\nThe brick chimney extended into the room and formed a ledge that served\r\nas mantel shelf. From the big, low-hanging rafters swung an assortment\r\nof fishing tackle, a gun, some discarded articles of clothing and a\r\nstring of red peppers. The boards of the floor were broad, rough and\r\nloosely joined together.\r\n\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore and Za\xc3\xafda seated themselves on opposite sides of the table\r\nand the negro went out to the wood pile to gather chips and pieces of\r\nbois-gras with which to kindle a small fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a little chilly; he supposed the two would want coffee and he\r\nknew that Wat Gibson would ask for a cup the first thing on his arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder w\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s keepin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99im,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Za\xc3\xafda impatiently. Tel\xc3\xa8sphore\r\nlooked at his watch. He had been looking at it at intervals of one\r\nminute straight along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ten minutes pas\xe2\x80\x99 one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He offered no further comment.\r\n\r\nAt twelve minutes past one Za\xc3\xafda\xe2\x80\x99s restlessness again broke into speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine, me, w\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s become of Andr\xc3\xa9! He said he\xe2\x80\x99d be yere sho\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat one.\xe2\x80\x9d The old negro was kneeling before the fire that he had kindled,\r\ncontemplating the cheerful blaze. He rolled his eyes toward Za\xc3\xafda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout Mr. Andr\xc3\xa9 Pascal? No need to look fo\xe2\x80\x99 him. Mr. Andre\r\nhe b\xe2\x80\x99en down to de P\xe2\x80\x99int all day raisin\xe2\x80\x99 Cain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a lie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Za\xc3\xafda. Tel\xc3\xa8sphore said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTain\xe2\x80\x99t no lie, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; he b\xe2\x80\x99en sho\xe2\x80\x99 raisin\xe2\x80\x99 de ole Nick.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at\r\nhim, too contemptuous to reply.\r\n\r\nThe negro told no lie so far as his bald statement was concerned. He was\r\nsimply mistaken in his estimate of Andr\xc3\xa9 Pascal\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \xe2\x80\x9craise\r\nCain\xe2\x80\x9d during an entire afternoon and evening and still keep a rendezvous\r\nwith a lady at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. For Andr\xc3\xa9 was even then at\r\nhand, as the loud and menacing howl of the dog testified. The negro\r\nhastened out to admit him.\r\n\r\nAndr\xc3\xa9 did not enter at once; he stayed a while outside abusing the dog\r\nand communicating to the negro his intention of coming out to shoot the\r\nanimal after he had attended to more pressing business that was awaiting\r\nhim within.\r\n\r\nZa\xc3\xafda arose, a little flurried and excited when he entered. Tel\xc3\xa8sphore\r\nremained seated.\r\n\r\nPascal was partially sober. There had evidently been an attempt at\r\ndressing for the occasion at some early part of the previous day, but\r\nsuch evidences had almost wholly vanished. His linen was soiled and his\r\nwhole appearance was that of a man who, by an effort, had aroused\r\nhimself from a debauch. He was a little taller than Tel\xc3\xa8sphore, and more\r\nloosely put together. Most women would have called him a handsomer man.\r\nIt was easy to imagine that when sober, he might betray by some subtle\r\ngrace of speech or manner, evidences of gentle blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99y did you keep me waitin\xe2\x80\x99, Andr\xc3\xa9? w\xe2\x80\x99en you knew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she got no further,\r\nbut backed up against the table and stared at him with earnest, startled\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep you waiting, Za\xc3\xafda? my dear li\xe2\x80\x99le Za\xc3\xafd\xc3\xa9, how can you say such a\r\nthing! I started up yere an hour ago an\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x94w\xe2\x80\x99ere\xe2\x80\x99s that damned ole\r\nGibson?\xe2\x80\x9d He had approached Za\xc3\xafda with the evident intention of embracing\r\nher, but she seized his wrist and held him at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length away. In\r\ncasting his eyes about for old Gibson his glance alighted upon\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the \xe2\x80\x99Cadian seemed to fill him with astonishment. He stood\r\nback and began to contemplate the young fellow and lose himself in\r\nspeculation and conjecture before him, as if before some unlabeled wax\r\nfigure. He turned for information to Za\xc3\xafda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Za\xc3\xafda, w\xe2\x80\x99at you call this? Wat kine of damn fool you got sitting\r\nyere? Who let him in? W\xe2\x80\x99at you reckon he\xe2\x80\x99s lookin\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99? trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore said nothing; he was awaiting his cue from Za\xc3\xafda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndr\xc3\xa9 Pascal,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou jus\xe2\x80\x99 as well take the do\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 go. You\r\nmight stan\xe2\x80\x99 yere till the day o\xe2\x80\x99 judgment on yo\xe2\x80\x99 knees befo\xe2\x80\x99 me; an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nblow out yo\xe2\x80\x99 brains if you a mine to. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t neva goin\xe2\x80\x99 to marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hell you ain\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had hardly more than uttered the words when he lay prone on his back.\r\nTel\xc3\xa8sphore had knocked him down. The blow seemed to complete the process\r\nof sobering that had begun in him. He gathered himself together and rose\r\nto his feet; in doing so he reached back for his pistol. His hold was\r\nnot yet steady, however, and the weapon slipped from his grasp and fell\r\nto the floor. Za\xc3\xafda picked it up and laid it on the table behind her.\r\nShe was going to see fair play.\r\n\r\nThe brute instinct that drives men at each other\xe2\x80\x99s throat was awake and\r\nstirring in these two. Each saw in the other a thing to be wiped out of\r\nhis way\xe2\x80\x94out of existence if need be. Passion and blind rage directed the\r\nblows which they dealt, and steeled the tension of muscles and clutch of\r\nfingers. They were not skillful blows, however.\r\n\r\nThe fire blazed cheerily; the kettle which the negro had placed upon the\r\ncoals was steaming and singing. The man had gone in search of his\r\nmaster. Za\xc3\xafda had placed the lamp out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way on the high mantel\r\nledge and she leaned back with her hands behind her upon the table.\r\n\r\nShe did not raise her voice or lift her finger to stay the combat that\r\nwas acting before her. She was motionless, and white to the lips; only\r\nher eyes seemed to be alive and burning and blazing. At one moment she\r\nfelt that Andr\xc3\xa9 must have strangled Tel\xc3\xa8sphore; but she said nothing.\r\nThe next instant she could hardly doubt that the blow from Tel\xc3\xa8sphore\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoubled fist could be less than a killing one; but she did nothing.\r\n\r\nHow the loose boards swayed and creaked beneath the weight of the\r\nstruggling men! the very old rafters seemed to groan; and she felt that\r\nthe house shook.\r\n\r\nThe combat, if fierce, was short, and it ended out on the gallery\r\nwhither they had staggered through the open door\xe2\x80\x94or one had dragged the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94she could not tell. But she knew when it was over, for there was a\r\nlong moment of utter stillness. Then she heard one of the men descend\r\nthe steps and go away, for the gate slammed after him. The other went\r\nout to the cistern; the sound of the tin bucket splashing in the water\r\nreached her where she stood. He must have been endeavoring to remove\r\ntraces of the encounter.\r\n\r\nPresently Tel\xc3\xa8sphore entered the room. The elegance of his apparel had\r\nbeen somewhat marred; the men over at the \xe2\x80\x99Cadian ball would hardly have\r\ntaken exception now to his appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99ere is Andr\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tel\xc3\xa8sphore.\r\n\r\nShe had never changed her position and now when she drew herself up her\r\nwrists ached and she rubbed them a little. She was no longer pale; the\r\nblood had come back into her cheeks and lips, staining them crimson. She\r\nheld out her hand to him. He took it gratefully enough, but he did not\r\nknow what to do with it; that is, he did not know what he might dare to\r\ndo with it, so he let it drop gently away and went to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon we betta be goin\xe2\x80\x99, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. He stooped and poured some\r\nof the bubbling water from the kettle upon the coffee which the negro\r\nhad set upon the hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make a li\xe2\x80\x99le coffee firs\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he proposed, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 anyhow we betta wait\r\ntill ole man w\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99shis-name comes back. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look well to leave\r\nhis house that way without some kine of excuse or explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, but seated herself submissively beside the table.\r\n\r\nHer will, which had been overmastering and aggressive, seemed to have\r\ngrown numb under the disturbing spell of the past few hours. An illusion\r\nhad gone from her, and had carried her love with it. The absence of\r\nregret revealed this to her. She realized, but could not comprehend it,\r\nnot knowing that the love had been part of the illusion. She was tired\r\nin body and spirit, and it was with a sense of restfulness that she sat\r\nall drooping and relaxed and watched Tel\xc3\xa8sphore make the coffee.\r\n\r\nHe made enough for them both and a cup for old Wat Gibson when he should\r\ncome in, and also one for the negro. He supposed the cups, the sugar and\r\nspoons were in the safe over there in the corner, and that is where he\r\nfound them.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally said to Za\xc3\xafda, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take you home now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand drew her shawl around her, pinning it under the chin, she was like a\r\nlittle child and followed whither he led in all confidence.\r\n\r\nIt was Tel\xc3\xa8sphore who drove on the way back, and he let the pony cut no\r\ncapers, but held him to a steady and tempered gait. The girl was still\r\nquiet and silent; she was thinking tenderly\xe2\x80\x94a little tearfully of those\r\ntwo old t\xc3\xaates-de-mulets yonder on Bayou de Glaize.\r\n\r\nHow they crept through the woods! and how dark it was and how still!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at time it is?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Za\xc3\xafda. Alas! he could not tell her; his\r\nwatch was broken. But almost for the first time in his life, Tel\xc3\xa8sphore\r\ndid not care what time it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\r\n\r\n                               Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse went away in the morning to make a visit to her parents, ten\r\nmiles back on rigolet de Bon Dieu. She did not return in the evening,\r\nand Cazeau, her husband, fretted not a little. He did not worry much\r\nabout Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, who, he suspected, was resting only too content in the\r\nbosom of her family; his chief solicitude was manifestly for the pony\r\nshe had ridden. He felt sure those \xe2\x80\x9clazy pigs,\xe2\x80\x9d her brothers, were\r\ncapable of neglecting it seriously. This misgiving Cazeau communicated\r\nto his servant, old F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9, who waited upon him at supper.\r\n\r\nHis voice was low pitched, and even softer than F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s. He was tall,\r\nsinewy, swarthy, and altogether severe looking. His thick black hair\r\nwaved, and it gleamed like the breast of a crow. The sweep of his\r\nmustache, which was not so black, outlined the broad contour of the\r\nmouth. Beneath the under lip grew a small tuft which he was much given\r\nto twisting, and which he permitted to grow, apparently for no other\r\npurpose. Cazeau\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were dark blue, narrow and overshadowed. His\r\nhands were coarse and stiff from close acquaintance with farming tools\r\nand implements, and he handled his fork and knife clumsily. But he was\r\ndistinguished looking, and succeeded in commanding a good deal of\r\nrespect, and even fear sometimes.\r\n\r\nHe ate his supper alone, by the light of a single coal-oil lamp that but\r\nfaintly illuminated the big room, with its bare floor and huge rafters,\r\nand its heavy pieces of furniture that loomed dimly in the gloom of the\r\napartment. F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9, ministering to his wants, hovered about the table\r\nlike a little, bent, restless shadow.\r\n\r\nShe served him with a dish of sunfish fried crisp and brown. There was\r\nnothing else set before him beside the bread and butter and the bottle\r\nof red wine which she locked carefully in the buffet after he had poured\r\nhis second glass. She was occupied with her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s absence, and kept\r\nreverting to it after he had expressed his solicitude about the pony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat beat me! on\xe2\x80\x99y marry two mont\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 got de head turn\xe2\x80\x99 a\xe2\x80\x99ready to go\r\n\xe2\x80\x99broad. C\xe2\x80\x99est pas Chr\xc3\xa9tien, t\xc3\xa9nez!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCazeau shrugged his shoulders for answer, after he had drained his glass\r\nand pushed aside his plate. F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of the unchristian-like\r\nbehavior of his wife in leaving him thus alone after two months of\r\nmarriage weighed little with him. He was used to solitude, and did not\r\nmind a day or a night or two of it. He had lived alone ten years, since\r\nhis first wife died, and F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9 might have known better than to\r\nsuppose that he cared. He told her she was a fool. It sounded like a\r\ncompliment in his modulated, caressing voice. She grumbled to herself as\r\nshe set about clearing the table, and Cazeau arose and walked outside on\r\nthe gallery; his spur, which he had not removed upon entering the house,\r\njangled at every step.\r\n\r\nThe night was beginning to deepen, and to gather black about the\r\nclusters of trees and shrubs that were grouped in the yard. In the beam\r\nof light from the open kitchen door a black boy stood feeding a brace of\r\nsnarling, hungry dogs; further away, on the steps of a cabin, some one\r\nwas playing the accordion; and in still another direction a little negro\r\nbaby was crying lustily. Cazeau walked around to the front of the house,\r\nwhich was square, squat and one-story.\r\n\r\nA belated wagon was driving in at the gate, and the impatient driver was\r\nswearing hoarsely at his jaded oxen. F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9 stepped out on the\r\ngallery, glass and polishing towel in hand, to investigate, and to\r\nwonder, too, who could be singing out on the river. It was a party of\r\nyoung people paddling around, waiting for the moon to rise, and they\r\nwere singing Juanita, their voices coming tempered and melodious through\r\nthe distance and the night.\r\n\r\nCazeau\xe2\x80\x99s horse was waiting, saddled, ready to be mounted, for Cazeau had\r\nmany things to attend to before bed-time; so many things that there was\r\nnot left to him a moment in which to think of Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse. He felt her\r\nabsence, though, like a dull, insistent pain.\r\n\r\nHowever, before he slept that night he was visited by the thought of\r\nher, and by a vision of her fair young face with its drooping lips and\r\nsullen and averted eyes. The marriage had been a blunder; he had only to\r\nlook into her eyes to feel that, to discover her growing aversion. But\r\nit was a thing not by any possibility to be undone. He was quite\r\nprepared to make the best of it, and expected no less than a like effort\r\non her part. The less she revisited the rigolet, the better. He would\r\nfind means to keep her at home hereafter.\r\n\r\nThese unpleasant reflections kept Cazeau awake far into the night,\r\nnotwithstanding the craving of his whole body for rest and sleep. The\r\nmoon was shining, and its pale effulgence reached dimly into the room,\r\nand with it a touch of the cool breath of the spring night. There was an\r\nunusual stillness abroad; no sound to be heard save the distant,\r\ntireless, plaintive notes of the accordion.\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse did not return the following day, even though her husband sent\r\nher word to do so by her brother, Mont\xc3\xa9clin, who passed on his way to\r\nthe village early in the morning.\r\n\r\nOn the third day Cazeau saddled his horse and went himself in search of\r\nher. She had sent no word, no message, explaining her absence, and he\r\nfelt that he had good cause to be offended. It was rather awkward to\r\nhave to leave his work, even though late in the afternoon,\xe2\x80\x94Cazeau had\r\nalways so much to do; but among the many urgent calls upon him, the task\r\nof bringing his wife back to a sense of her duty seemed to him for the\r\nmoment paramount.\r\n\r\nThe Mich\xc3\xa9s, Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s parents, lived on the old Gotrain place. It did\r\nnot belong to them; they were \xe2\x80\x9crunning\xe2\x80\x9d it for a merchant in Alexandria.\r\nThe house was far too big for their use. One of the lower rooms served\r\nfor the storing of wood and tools; the person \xe2\x80\x9coccupying\xe2\x80\x9d the place\r\nbefore Mich\xc3\xa9 having pulled up the flooring in despair of being able to\r\npatch it. Upstairs, the rooms were so large, so bare, that they offered\r\na constant temptation to lovers of the dance, whose importunities Madame\r\nMich\xc3\xa9 was accustomed to meet with amiable indulgence. A dance at Mich\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand a plate of Madame Mich\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s gumbo fil\xc3\xa9 at midnight were pleasures not\r\nto be neglected or despised, unless by such serious souls as Cazeau.\r\n\r\nLong before Cazeau reached the house his approach had been observed, for\r\nthere was nothing to obstruct the view of the outer road; vegetation was\r\nnot yet abundantly advanced, and there was but a patchy, straggling\r\nstand of cotton and corn in Mich\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s field.\r\n\r\nMadame Mich\xc3\xa9, who had been seated on the gallery in a rocking-chair,\r\nstood up to greet him as he drew near. She was short and fat, and wore a\r\nblack skirt and loose muslin sack fastened at the throat with a hair\r\nbrooch. Her own hair, brown and glossy, showed but a few threads of\r\nsilver. Her round pink face was cheery, and her eyes were bright and\r\ngood humored. But she was plainly perturbed and ill at ease as Cazeau\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin, who was there too, was not ill at ease, and made no attempt\r\nto disguise the dislike with which his brother-in-law inspired him. He\r\nwas a slim, wiry fellow of twenty-five, short of stature like his\r\nmother, and resembling her in feature. He was in shirtsleeves, half\r\nleaning, half sitting, on the insecure railing of the gallery, and\r\nfanning himself with his broad-rimmed felt hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCochon!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered under his breath as Cazeau mounted the\r\nstairs,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csacr\xc3\xa9 cochon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCochon\xe2\x80\x9d had sufficiently characterized the man who had once on a time\r\ndeclined to lend Mont\xc3\xa9clin money. But when this same man had had the\r\npresumption to propose marriage to his well-beloved sister, Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse,\r\nand the honor to be accepted by her, Mont\xc3\xa9clin felt that a qualifying\r\nepithet was needed fully to express his estimate of Cazeau.\r\n\r\nMich\xc3\xa9 and his oldest son were absent. They both esteemed Cazeau highly,\r\nand talked much of his qualities of head and heart, and thought much of\r\nhis excellent standing with city merchants.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse had shut herself up in her room. Cazeau had seen her rise and\r\nenter the house at perceiving him. He was a good deal mystified, but no\r\none could have guessed it when he shook hands with Madame Mich\xc3\xa9. He had\r\nonly nodded to Mont\xc3\xa9clin, with a muttered \xe2\x80\x9cComment \xc3\xa7a va?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTiens! something tole me you were coming to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madame\r\nMich\xc3\xa9, with a little blustering appearance of being cordial and at ease,\r\nas she offered Cazeau a chair.\r\n\r\nHe ventured a short laugh as he seated himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, nothing would do,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, with much gesture of her\r\nsmall, plump hands, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing would do but Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse mus\xe2\x80\x99 stay las\xe2\x80\x99 night\r\nfo\xe2\x80\x99 a li\xe2\x80\x99le dance. The boys wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 year to their sister leaving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCazeau shrugged his shoulders significantly, telling as plainly as words\r\nthat he knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComment. Mont\xc3\xa9clin didn\xe2\x80\x99 tell you we were going to keep Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin had evidently told nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 how about the night befo\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Cazeau, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 las\xe2\x80\x99 night? It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t possible you dance every night out yere on the Bon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Mich\xc3\xa9 laughed, with amiable appreciation of the sarcasm; and\r\nturning to her son, \xe2\x80\x9cMont\xc3\xa9clin, my boy, go tell yo\xe2\x80\x99 sister that Monsieur\r\nCazeau is yere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin did not stir except to shift his position and settle himself\r\nmore securely on the railing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you year me, Mont\xc3\xa9clin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I yeard you plain enough,\xe2\x80\x9d responded her son, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know as\r\nwell as me it\xe2\x80\x99s no use to tell \xe2\x80\x99Th\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse anything. You been talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nher yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f since Monday; an\xe2\x80\x99 pa\xe2\x80\x99s preached himse\xe2\x80\x99f hoa\xe2\x80\x99se on the\r\nsubject; an\xe2\x80\x99 you even had uncle Achille down yere yesterday to reason\r\nwith her. Wen \xe2\x80\x99Th\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse said she wasn\xe2\x80\x99 goin\xe2\x80\x99 to set her foot back in\r\nCazeau\xe2\x80\x99s house, she meant it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech, which Mont\xc3\xa9clin delivered with thorough unconcern, threw\r\nhis mother into a condition of painful but dumb embarrassment. It\r\nbrought two fiery red spots to Cazeau\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, and for the space of a\r\nmoment he looked wicked.\r\n\r\nWhat Mont\xc3\xa9clin had spoken was quite true, though his taste in the manner\r\nand choice of time and place in saying it were not of the best.\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, upon the first day of her arrival, had announced that she\r\ncame to stay, having no intention of returning under Cazeau\xe2\x80\x99s roof. The\r\nannouncement had scattered consternation, as she knew it would. She had\r\nbeen implored, scolded, entreated, stormed at, until she felt herself\r\nlike a dragging sail that all the winds of heaven had beaten upon. Why\r\nin the name of God had she married Cazeau? Her father had lashed her\r\nwith the question a dozen times. Why indeed? It was difficult now for\r\nher to understand why, unless because she supposed it was customary for\r\ngirls to marry when the right opportunity came. Cazeau, she knew, would\r\nmake life more comfortable for her; and again, she had liked him, and\r\nhad even been rather flustered when he pressed her hands and kissed\r\nthem, and kissed her lips and cheeks and eyes, when she accepted him.\r\n\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin himself had taken her aside to talk the thing over. The turn\r\nof affairs was delighting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, \xe2\x80\x99Th\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, you mus\xe2\x80\x99 explain to me all about it, so we can\r\nsettle on a good cause, an\xe2\x80\x99 secu\xe2\x80\x99 a separation fo\xe2\x80\x99 you. Has he been\r\nmistreating an\xe2\x80\x99 abusing you, the sacr\xc3\xa9 cochon?\xe2\x80\x9d They were alone together\r\nin her room, whither she had taken refuge from the angry domestic\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou please to reserve yo\xe2\x80\x99 disgusting expressions, Mont\xc3\xa9clin. No, he has\r\nnot abused me in any way that I can think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he drink? Come \xe2\x80\x99Th\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, think well over it. Does he ever get\r\ndrunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrunk! Oh, mercy, no,\xe2\x80\x94Cazeau never gets drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see; it\xe2\x80\x99s jus\xe2\x80\x99 simply you feel like me; you hate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate him,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned reflectively; adding with a sudden\r\nimpulse, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s jus\xe2\x80\x99 being married that I detes\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 despise. I hate\r\nbeing Mrs. Cazeau, an\xe2\x80\x99 would want to be Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse Mich\xc3\xa9 again. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstan\xe2\x80\x99 to live with a man; to have him always there; his coats an\xe2\x80\x99\r\npantaloons hanging in my room; his ugly bare feet\xe2\x80\x94washing them in my\r\ntub, befo\xe2\x80\x99 my very eyes, ugh!\xe2\x80\x9d She shuddered with recollections, and\r\nresumed, with a sigh that was almost a sob: \xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, mon Dieu! Sister\r\nMarie Ang\xc3\xa9lique knew w\xe2\x80\x99at she was saying; she knew me better than myse\xe2\x80\x99f\r\nw\xe2\x80\x99en she said God had sent me a vocation an\xe2\x80\x99 I was turning deaf ears.\r\nW\xe2\x80\x99en I think of a blessed life in the convent, at peace! Oh, w\xe2\x80\x99at was I\r\ndreaming of!\xe2\x80\x9d and then the tears came.\r\n\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin felt disconcerted and greatly disappointed at having obtained\r\nevidence that would carry no weight with a court of justice. The day had\r\nnot come when a young woman might ask the court\xe2\x80\x99s permission to return\r\nto her mamma on the sweeping ground of a constitutional disinclination\r\nfor marriage. But if there was no way of untying this Gordian knot of\r\nmarriage, there was surely a way of cutting it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99Th\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, I\xe2\x80\x99m mighty durn sorry yo got no better groun\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99an\r\nw\xe2\x80\x99at you say. But you can count on me to stan\xe2\x80\x99 by you w\xe2\x80\x99atever you do.\r\nGod knows I don\xe2\x80\x99 blame you fo\xe2\x80\x99 not wantin\xe2\x80\x99 to live with Cazeau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now there was Cazeau himself, with the red spots flaming in his\r\nswarthy cheeks, looking and feeling as if he wanted to thrash Mont\xc3\xa9clin\r\ninto some semblance of decency. He arose abruptly, and approaching the\r\nroom which he had seen his wife enter, thrust open the door after a\r\nhasty preliminary knock. Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, who was standing erect at a far\r\nwindow, turned at his entrance.\r\n\r\nShe appeared neither angry nor frightened, but thoroughly unhappy, with\r\nan appeal in her soft dark eyes and a tremor on her lips that seemed to\r\nhim expressions of unjust reproach, that wounded and maddened him at\r\nonce. But whatever he might feel, Cazeau knew only one way to act toward\r\na woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, you are not ready?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in his quiet tones. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting late; we havn\xe2\x80\x99 any time to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knew that Mont\xc3\xa9clin had spoken out, and she had hoped for a wordy\r\ninterview, a stormy scene, in which she might have held her own as she\r\nhad held it for the past three days against her family, with Mont\xc3\xa9clin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naid. But she had no weapon with which to combat subtlety. Her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlooks, his tones, his mere presence, brought to her a sudden sense of\r\nhopelessness, an instinctive realization of the futility of rebellion\r\nagainst a social and sacred institution.\r\n\r\nCazeau said nothing further, but stood waiting in the doorway. Madame\r\nMich\xc3\xa9 had walked to the far end of the gallery, and pretended to be\r\noccupied with having a chicken driven from her parterre. Mont\xc3\xa9clin stood\r\nby, exasperated, fuming, ready to burst out.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse went and reached for her riding skirt that hung against the\r\nwall. She was rather tall, with a figure which, though not robust,\r\nseemed perfect in its fine proportions. \xe2\x80\x9cLa fille de son p\xc3\xa8re,\xe2\x80\x9d she was\r\noften called, which was a great compliment to Mich\xc3\xa9. Her brown hair was\r\nbrushed all fluffily back from her temples and low forehead, and about\r\nher features and expression lurked a softness, a prettiness, a dewiness,\r\nthat were perhaps too childlike, that savored of immaturity.\r\n\r\nShe slipped the riding-skirt, which was of black alpaca, over her head,\r\nand with impatient fingers hooked it at the waist over her pink\r\nlinen-lawn. Then she fastened on her white sunbonnet and reached for her\r\ngloves on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99 wan\xe2\x80\x99 to go, you know w\xe2\x80\x99at you got to do, \xe2\x80\x99Th\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse,\xe2\x80\x9d fumed\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99 set yo\xe2\x80\x99 feet back on Cane River, by God, unless you\r\nwant to,\xe2\x80\x94not w\xe2\x80\x99ile I\xe2\x80\x99m alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCazeau looked at him as if he were a monkey whose antics fell short of\r\nbeing amusing.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse still made no reply, said not a word. She walked rapidly past\r\nher husband, past her brother; bidding good-bye to no one, not even to\r\nher mother. She descended the stairs, and without assistance from any\r\none mounted the pony, which Cazeau had ordered to be saddled upon his\r\narrival. In this way she obtained a fair start of her husband, whose\r\ndeparture was far more leisurely, and for the greater part of the way\r\nshe managed to keep an appreciable gap between them. She rode almost\r\nmadly at first, with the wind inflating her skirt balloon-like about her\r\nknees, and her sunbonnet falling back between her shoulders.\r\n\r\nAt no time did Cazeau make an effort to overtake her until traversing an\r\nold fallow meadow that was level and hard as a table. The sight of a\r\ngreat solitary oak-tree, with its seemingly immutable outlines, that had\r\nbeen a landmark for ages\xe2\x80\x94or was it the odor of elderberry stealing up\r\nfrom the gully to the south? or what was it that brought vividly back to\r\nCazeau, by some association of ideas, a scene of many years ago? He had\r\npassed that old live-oak hundreds of times, but it was only now that the\r\nmemory of one day came back to him. He was a very small boy that day,\r\nseated before his father on horseback. They were proceeding slowly, and\r\nBlack Gabe was moving on before them at a little dog-trot. Black Gabe\r\nhad run away, and had been discovered back in the Gotrain swamp. They\r\nhad halted beneath this big oak to enable the negro to take breath; for\r\nCazeau\xe2\x80\x99s father was a kind and considerate master, and every one had\r\nagreed at the time that Black Gabe was a fool, a great idiot indeed, for\r\nwanting to run away from him.\r\n\r\nThe whole impression was for some reason hideous, and to dispel it\r\nCazeau spurred his horse to a swift gallop. Overtaking his wife, he rode\r\nthe remainder of the way at her side in silence.\r\n\r\nIt was late when they reached home. F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9 was standing on the grassy\r\nedge of the road, in the moonlight, waiting for them.\r\n\r\nCazeau once more ate his supper alone; for Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse went to her room,\r\nand there she was crying again.\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was not one to accept the inevitable with patient resignation,\r\na talent born in the souls of many women; neither was she the one to\r\naccept it with philosophical resignation, like her husband. Her\r\nsensibilities were alive and keen and responsive. She met the\r\npleasurable things of life with frank, open appreciation, and against\r\ndistasteful conditions she rebelled. Dissimulation was as foreign to her\r\nnature as guile to the breast of a babe, and her rebellious outbreaks,\r\nby no means rare, had hitherto been quite open and aboveboard. People\r\noften said that Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse would know her own mind some day, which was\r\nequivalent to saying that she was at present unacquainted with it. If\r\nshe ever came to such knowledge, it would be by no intellectual\r\nresearch, by no subtle analyses or tracing the motives of actions to\r\ntheir source. It would come to her as the song to the bird, the perfume\r\nand color to the flower.\r\n\r\nHer parents had hoped\xe2\x80\x94not without reason and justice\xe2\x80\x94that marriage would\r\nbring the poise, the desirable pose, so glaringly lacking in Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter. Marriage they knew to be a wonderful and powerful agent in\r\nthe development and formation of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s character; they had seen its\r\neffect too often to doubt it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if this marriage does nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mich\xc3\xa9 in an outburst\r\nof sudden exasperation, \xe2\x80\x9cit will rid us of Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse; for I am at the\r\nend of my patience with her! You have never had the firmness to manage\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he was speaking to his wife,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have not had the time, the\r\nleisure, to devote to her training; and what good we might have\r\naccomplished, that maudit Mont\xc3\xa9clin\xe2\x80\x94Well, Cazeau is the one! It takes\r\njust such a steady hand to guide a disposition like Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s, a\r\nmaster hand, a strong will that compels obedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now, when they had hoped for so much, here was Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, with\r\ngathered and fierce vehemence, beside which her former outbursts\r\nappeared mild, declaring that she would not, and she would not, and she\r\nwould not continue to enact the r\xc3\xb4le of wife to Cazeau. If she had had a\r\nreason! as Madame Mich\xc3\xa9 lamented; but it could not be discovered that\r\nshe had any sane one. He had never scolded, or called names, or deprived\r\nher of comforts, or been guilty of any of the many reprehensible acts\r\ncommonly attributed to objectionable husbands. He did not slight nor\r\nneglect her. Indeed, Cazeau\xe2\x80\x99s chief offense seemed to be that he loved\r\nher, and Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was not the woman to be loved against her will. She\r\ncalled marriage a trap set for the feet of unwary and unsuspecting\r\ngirls, and in round, unmeasured terms reproached her mother with\r\ntreachery and deceit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you Cazeau was the man,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Mich\xc3\xa9, when his wife had\r\nrelated the scene that had accompanied and influenced Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse again hoped, in the morning, that Cazeau would scold or make\r\nsome sort of a scene, but he apparently did not dream of it. It was\r\nexasperating that he should take her acquiescence so for granted. It is\r\ntrue he had been up and over the fields and across the river and back\r\nlong before she was out of bed, and he may have been thinking of\r\nsomething else, which was no excuse, which was even in some sense an\r\naggravation. But he did say to her at breakfast, \xe2\x80\x9cThat brother of yo\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthat Mont\xc3\xa9clin, is unbearable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMont\xc3\xa9clin? Par exemple!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, seated opposite to her husband, was attired in a white\r\nmorning wrapper. She wore a somewhat abused, long face, it is true,\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nexpression of countenance familiar to some husbands,\xe2\x80\x94but the expression\r\nwas not sufficiently pronounced to mar the charm of her youthful\r\nfreshness. She had little heart to eat, only playing with the food\r\nbefore her, and she felt a pang of resentment at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s healthy\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mont\xc3\xa9clin,\xe2\x80\x9d he reasserted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s developed into a firs\xe2\x80\x99-class\r\nnuisance; an\xe2\x80\x99 you better tell him, Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse,\xe2\x80\x94unless you want me to tell\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94to confine his energies after this to matters that concern him. I\r\nhave no use fo\xe2\x80\x99 him or fo\xe2\x80\x99 his interference in w\xe2\x80\x99at regards you an\xe2\x80\x99 me\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was said with unusual asperity. It was the little breach that\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse had been watching for, and she charged rapidly: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s strange,\r\nif you detes\xe2\x80\x99 Mont\xc3\xa9clin so heartily, that you would desire to marry his\r\nsister.\xe2\x80\x9d She knew it was a silly thing to say, and was not surprised\r\nwhen he told her so. It gave her a little foothold for further attack,\r\nhowever. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see, anyhow, w\xe2\x80\x99at reason you had to marry me, w\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nthere were so many others,\xe2\x80\x9d she complained, as if accusing him of\r\npersecution and injury. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was Marianne running after you fo\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nlas\xe2\x80\x99 five years till it was disgraceful; an\xe2\x80\x99 any one of the Dortrand\r\ngirls would have been glad to marry you. But no, nothing would do; you\r\nmus\xe2\x80\x99 come out on the rigolet fo\xe2\x80\x99 me.\xe2\x80\x9d Her complaint was pathetic, and at\r\nthe same time so amusing that Cazeau was forced to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see w\xe2\x80\x99at the Dortrand girls or Marianne have to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrejoined; adding, with no trace of amusement, \xe2\x80\x9cI married you because I\r\nloved you; because you were the woman I wanted to marry, an\xe2\x80\x99 the only\r\none. I reckon I tole you that befo\xe2\x80\x99. I thought\xe2\x80\x94of co\xe2\x80\x99se I was a fool fo\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntaking things fo\xe2\x80\x99 granted\xe2\x80\x94but I did think that I might make you happy in\r\nmaking things easier an\xe2\x80\x99 mo\xe2\x80\x99 comfortable fo\xe2\x80\x99 you. I expected\xe2\x80\x94I was even\r\nthat big a fool\xe2\x80\x94I believed that yo\xe2\x80\x99 coming yere to me would be like the\r\nsun shining out of the clouds, an\xe2\x80\x99 that our days would be like w\xe2\x80\x99at the\r\nstory-books promise after the wedding. I was mistaken. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimagine w\xe2\x80\x99at induced you to marry me. W\xe2\x80\x99atever it was, I reckon you\r\nfoun\xe2\x80\x99 out you made a mistake, too. I don\xe2\x80\x99 see anything to do but make\r\nthe best of a bad bargain, an\xe2\x80\x99 shake han\xe2\x80\x99s over it.\xe2\x80\x9d He had arisen from\r\nthe table, and, approaching, held out his hand to her. What he had said\r\nwas commonplace enough, but it was significant, coming from Cazeau, who\r\nwas not often so unreserved in expressing himself.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse ignored the hand held out to her. She was resting her chin in\r\nher palm, and kept her eyes fixed moodily upon the table. He rested his\r\nhand, that she would not touch, upon her head for an instant, and walked\r\naway out of the room.\r\n\r\nShe heard him giving orders to workmen who had been waiting for him out\r\non the gallery, and she heard him mount his horse and ride away. A\r\nhundred things would distract him and engage his attention during the\r\nday. She felt that he had perhaps put her and her grievance from his\r\nthoughts when he crossed the threshold; whilst she\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOld F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9 was standing there holding a shining tin pail, asking for\r\nflour and lard and eggs from the storeroom, and meal for the chicks.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse seized the bunch of keys which hung from her belt and flung\r\nthem at F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTiens! tu vas les garder comme tu as jadis fait. Je ne veux plus de ce\r\ntrain l\xc3\xa0, moi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman stooped and picked up the keys from the floor. It was\r\nreally all one to her that her mistress returned them to her keeping,\r\nand refused to take further account of the m\xc3\xa9nage.\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\nIt seemed now to Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse that Mont\xc3\xa9clin was the only friend left to\r\nher in the world. Her father and mother had turned from her in what\r\nappeared to be her hour of need. Her friends laughed at her, and refused\r\nto take seriously the hints which she threw out,\xe2\x80\x94feeling her way to\r\ndiscover if marriage were as distasteful to other women as to herself.\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin alone understood her. He alone had always been ready to act\r\nfor her and with her, to comfort and solace her with his sympathy and\r\nhis support. Her only hope for rescue from her hateful surroundings lay\r\nin Mont\xc3\xa9clin. Of herself she felt powerless to plan, to act, even to\r\nconceive a way out of this pitfall into which the whole world seemed to\r\nhave conspired to thrust her.\r\n\r\nShe had a great desire to see her brother, and wrote asking him to come\r\nto her. But it better suited Mont\xc3\xa9clin\xe2\x80\x99s spirit of adventure to appoint\r\na meeting-place at the turn of the lane, where Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse might appear to\r\nbe walking leisurely for health and recreation, and where he might seem\r\nto be riding along, bent on some errand of business or pleasure.\r\n\r\nThere had been a shower, a sudden downpour, short as it was sudden, that\r\nhad laid the dust in the road. It had freshened the pointed leaves of\r\nthe live-oaks, and brightened up the big fields of cotton on either side\r\nof the lane till they seemed carpeted with green, glittering gems.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse walked along the grassy edge of the road, lifting her crisp\r\nskirts with one hand, and with the other twirling a gay sunshade over\r\nher bare head. The scent of the fields after the rain was delicious. She\r\ninhaled long breaths of their freshness and perfume, that soothed and\r\nquieted her for the moment. There were birds splashing and spluttering\r\nin the pools, pluming themselves on the fence-*rails, and sending out\r\nlittle sharp cries, twitters, and shrill rhapsodies of delight.\r\n\r\nShe saw Mont\xc3\xa9clin approaching from a great distance,\xe2\x80\x94almost as far away\r\nas the turn of the woods. But she could not feel sure it was he; it\r\nappeared too tall for Mont\xc3\xa9clin, but that was because he was riding a\r\nlarge horse. She waved her parasol to him; she was so glad to see him.\r\nShe had never been so glad to see Mont\xc3\xa9clin before; not even the day\r\nwhen he had taken her out of the convent, against her parents\xe2\x80\x99 wishes,\r\nbecause she had expressed a desire to remain there no longer. He seemed\r\nto her, as he drew near, the embodiment of kindness, of bravery, of\r\nchivalry, even of wisdom; for she had never known Mont\xc3\xa9clin at a loss to\r\nextricate himself from a disagreeable situation.\r\n\r\nHe dismounted, and, leading his horse by the bridle, started to walk\r\nbeside her, after he had kissed her affectionately and asked her what\r\nshe was crying about. She protested that she was not crying, for she was\r\nlaughing, though drying her eyes at the same time on her handkerchief,\r\nrolled in a soft mop for the purpose.\r\n\r\nShe took Mont\xc3\xa9clin\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and they strolled slowly down the lane; they\r\ncould not seat themselves for a comfortable chat, as they would have\r\nliked, with the grass all sparkling and bristling wet.\r\n\r\nYes, she was quite as wretched as ever, she told him. The week which had\r\ngone by since she saw him had in no wise lightened the burden of her\r\ndiscontent. There had even been some additional provocations laid upon\r\nher, and she told Mont\xc3\xa9clin all about them,\xe2\x80\x94about the keys, for\r\ninstance, which in a fit of temper she had returned to F\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkeeping; and she told how Cazeau had brought them back to her as if they\r\nwere something she had accidentally lost, and he had recovered; and how\r\nhe had said, in that aggravating tone of his, that it was not the custom\r\non Cane river for the negro servants to carry the keys, when there was a\r\nmistress at the head of the household.\r\n\r\nBut Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse could not tell Mont\xc3\xa9clin anything to increase the\r\ndisrespect which he already entertained for his brother-in-law; and it\r\nwas then he unfolded to her a plan which he had conceived and worked out\r\nfor her deliverance from this galling matrimonial yoke.\r\n\r\nIt was not a plan which met with instant favor, which she was at once\r\nready to accept, for it involved secrecy and dissimulation, hateful\r\nalternatives, both of them. But she was filled with admiration for\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin\xe2\x80\x99s resources and wonderful talent for contrivance. She accepted\r\nthe plan; not with the immediate determination to act upon it, rather\r\nwith the intention to sleep and to dream upon it.\r\n\r\nThree days later she wrote to Mont\xc3\xa9clin that she had abandoned herself\r\nto his counsel. Displeasing as it might be to her sense of honesty, it\r\nwould yet be less trying than to live on with a soul full of bitterness\r\nand revolt, as she had done for the past two months.\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\nWhen Cazeau awoke, one morning at his usual very early hour, it was to\r\nfind the place at his side vacant. This did not surprise him until he\r\ndiscovered that Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was not in the adjoining room, where he had\r\noften found her sleeping in the morning on the lounge. She had perhaps\r\ngone out for an early stroll, he reflected, for her jacket and hat were\r\nnot on the rack where she had hung them the night before. But there were\r\nother things absent,\xe2\x80\x94a gown or two from the armoire; and there was a\r\ngreat gap in the piles of lingerie on the shelf; and her traveling-bag\r\nwas missing, and so were her bits of jewelry from the toilet tray\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was gone!\r\n\r\nBut the absurdity of going during the night, as if she had been a\r\nprisoner, and he the keeper of a dungeon! So much secrecy and mystery,\r\nto go sojourning out on the Bon Dieu? Well, the Mich\xc3\xa9s might keep their\r\ndaughter after this. For the companionship of no woman on earth would he\r\nagain undergo the humiliating sensation of baseness that had overtaken\r\nhim in passing the old oak-tree in the fallow meadow.\r\n\r\nBut a terrible sense of loss overwhelmed Cazeau. It was not new or\r\nsudden; he had felt it for weeks growing upon him, and it seemed to\r\nculminate with Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s flight from home. He knew that he could again\r\ncompel her return as he had done once before,\xe2\x80\x94compel her to return to\r\nthe shelter of his roof, compel her cold and unwilling submission to his\r\nlove and passionate transports; but the loss of self-respect seemed to\r\nhim too dear a price to pay for a wife.\r\n\r\nHe could not comprehend why she had seemed to prefer him above others;\r\nwhy she had attracted him with eyes, with voice, with a hundred womanly\r\nways, and finally distracted him with love which she seemed, in her\r\ntimid, maidenly fashion, to return. The great sense of loss came from\r\nthe realization of having missed a chance for happiness,\xe2\x80\x94a chance that\r\nwould come his way again only through a miracle. He could not think of\r\nhimself loving any other woman, and could not think of Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\r\never\xe2\x80\x94even at some remote date\xe2\x80\x94caring for him.\r\n\r\nHe wrote her a letter, in which he disclaimed any further intention of\r\nforcing his commands upon her. He did not desire her presence ever again\r\nin his home unless she came of her free will, uninfluenced by family or\r\nfriends; unless she could be the companion he had hoped for in marrying\r\nher, and in some measure return affection and respect for the love which\r\nhe continued and would always continue to feel for her. This letter he\r\nsent out to the rigolet by a messenger early in the day. But she was not\r\nout on the rigolet, and had not been there.\r\n\r\nThe family turned instinctively to Mont\xc3\xa9clin, and almost literally fell\r\nupon him for an explanation; he had been absent from home all night.\r\nThere was much mystification in his answers, and a plain desire to\r\nmislead in his assurances of ignorance and innocence.\r\n\r\nBut with Cazeau there was no doubt or speculation when he accosted the\r\nyoung fellow. \xe2\x80\x9cMont\xc3\xa9clin, w\xe2\x80\x99at have you done with Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nquestioned bluntly. They had met in the open road on horseback, just as\r\nCazeau ascended the river bank before his house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at have you done to Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mont\xc3\xa9clin for answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon you\xe2\x80\x99ve considered yo\xe2\x80\x99 conduct by any light of decency\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 propriety in encouraging yo\xe2\x80\x99 sister to such an action, but let me\r\ntell you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoyons! you can let me alone with yo\xe2\x80\x99 decency an\xe2\x80\x99 morality an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfiddlesticks. I know you mus\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse pretty mean that she\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t live with you; an\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99 my part, I\xe2\x80\x99m mighty durn glad she had the\r\nspirit to quit you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t in the humor to take any notice of yo\xe2\x80\x99 impertinence, Mont\xc3\xa9clin;\r\nbut let me remine you that Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse is nothing but a chile in\r\ncharacter; besides that, she\xe2\x80\x99s my wife, an\xe2\x80\x99 I hole you responsible fo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nher safety an\xe2\x80\x99 welfare. If any harm of any description happens to her,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll strangle you, by God, like a rat, and fling you in Cane river, if I\r\nhave to hang fo\xe2\x80\x99 it!\xe2\x80\x9d He had not lifted his voice. The only sign of\r\nanger was a savage gleam in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you better keep yo\xe2\x80\x99 big talk fo\xe2\x80\x99 the women, Cazeau,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMont\xc3\xa9clin, riding away.\r\n\r\nBut he went doubly armed after that, and intimated that the precaution\r\nwas not needless, in view of the threats and menaces that were abroad\r\ntouching his personal safety.\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse reached her destination sound of skin and limb, but a good\r\ndeal flustered, a little frightened, and altogether excited and\r\ninterested by her unusual experiences.\r\n\r\nHer destination was the house of Sylvie, on Dauphine Street, in New\r\nOrleans,\xe2\x80\x94a three-story gray brick, standing directly on the banquette,\r\nwith three broad stone steps leading to the deep front entrance. From\r\nthe second-story balcony swung a small sign, conveying to passers-by the\r\nintelligence that within were \xe2\x80\x9c_chambres garnies_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was one morning in the last week of April that Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse presented\r\nherself at the Dauphine Street house. Sylvie was expecting her, and\r\nintroduced her at once to her apartment, which was in the second story\r\nof the back ell, and accessible by an open, outside gallery. There was a\r\nyard below, paved with broad stone flagging; many fragrant flowering\r\nshrubs and plants grew in a bed along the side of the opposite wall, and\r\nothers were distributed about in tubs and green boxes.\r\n\r\nIt was a plain but large enough room into which Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was ushered,\r\nwith matting on the floor, green shades and Nottingham-lace curtains at\r\nthe windows that looked out on the gallery, and furnished with a cheap\r\nwalnut suit. But everything looked exquisitely clean, and the whole\r\nplace smelled of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse at once fell into the rocking-chair, with the air of\r\nexhaustion and intense relief of one who has come to the end of her\r\ntroubles. Sylvie, entering behind her, laid the big traveling-bag on the\r\nfloor and deposited the jacket on the bed.\r\n\r\nShe was a portly quadroon of fifty or thereabout, clad in an ample\r\n_volante_ of the old-fashioned purple calico so much affected by her\r\nclass. She wore large golden hoop-earrings, and her hair was combed\r\nplainly, with every appearance of effort to smooth out the kinks. She\r\nhad broad, coarse features, with a nose that turned up, exposing the\r\nwide nostrils, and that seemed to emphasize the loftiness and command of\r\nher bearing,\xe2\x80\x94a dignity that in the presence of white people assumed a\r\ncharacter of respectfulness, but never of obsequiousness. Sylvie\r\nbelieved firmly in maintaining the color-line, and would not suffer a\r\nwhite person, even a child, to call her \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Sylvie,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a title which\r\nshe exacted religiously, however, from those of her own race.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you be please\xe2\x80\x99 wid yo\xe2\x80\x99 room, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed amiably.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat\xe2\x80\x99s de same room w\xe2\x80\x99at yo\xe2\x80\x99 brother, M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Mich\xc3\xa9, all time like w\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nhe come to New Orlean\xe2\x80\x99. He well, M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Mich\xc3\xa9? I receive\xe2\x80\x99 his letter\r\nlas\xe2\x80\x99 week, an\xe2\x80\x99 dat same day a gent\xe2\x80\x99man want I give \xe2\x80\x99im dat room. I say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, dat room already ingage\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99 Ev-body like dat room on \xe2\x80\x99count it so\r\nquite (quiet). M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Gouvernail, dere in nax\xe2\x80\x99 room, you can\xe2\x80\x99t pay \xe2\x80\x99im!\r\nHe been stay t\xe2\x80\x99ree year\xe2\x80\x99 in dat room; but all fix\xe2\x80\x99 up fine wid his own\r\nfurn\xe2\x80\x99ture an\xe2\x80\x99 books, \xe2\x80\x99tel you can\xe2\x80\x99t see! I say to \xe2\x80\x99im plenty time\xe2\x80\x99,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Gouvernail, w\xe2\x80\x99y you don\xe2\x80\x99t take dat t\xe2\x80\x99ree-story front, now, long\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s empty?\xe2\x80\x99 He tells me, \xe2\x80\x98Leave me \xe2\x80\x99lone, Sylvie; I know a good room\r\nw\xe2\x80\x99en I fine it, me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been moving slowly and majestically about the apartment,\r\nstraightening and smoothing down bed and pillows, peering into ewer and\r\nbasin, evidently casting an eye around to make sure that everything was\r\nas it should be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sen\xe2\x80\x99 you some fresh water, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d she offered upon retiring from\r\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 w\xe2\x80\x99en you want an\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99ing, you jus\xe2\x80\x99 go out on de gall\xe2\x80\x99ry an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncall Pousette: she year you plain,\xe2\x80\x94she right down dere in de kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was really not so exhausted as she had every reason to be\r\nafter that interminable and circuitous way by which Mont\xc3\xa9clin had seen\r\nfit to have her conveyed to the city.\r\n\r\nWould she ever forget that dark and truly dangerous midnight ride along\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9ccoast\xe2\x80\x9d to the mouth of Cane river! There Mont\xc3\xa9clin had parted with\r\nher, after seeing her aboard the St. Louis and Shreveport packet which\r\nhe knew would pass there before dawn. She had received instructions to\r\ndisembark at the mouth of Red river, and there transfer to the first\r\nsouth-bound steamer for New Orleans; all of which instructions she had\r\nfollowed implicitly, even to making her way at once to Sylvie\xe2\x80\x99s upon her\r\narrival in the city. Mont\xc3\xa9clin had enjoined secrecy and much caution;\r\nthe clandestine nature of the affair gave it a savor of adventure which\r\nwas highly pleasing to him. Eloping with his sister was only a little\r\nless engaging than eloping with some one else\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\r\n\r\nBut Mont\xc3\xa9clin did not do the _grand seigneur_ by halves. He had paid\r\nSylvie a whole month in advance for Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s board and lodging. Part\r\nof the sum he had been forced to borrow, it is true, but he was not\r\nniggardly.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was to take her meals in the house, which none of the other\r\nlodgers did; the one exception being that Mr. Gouvernail was served with\r\nbreakfast on Sunday mornings.\r\n\r\nSylvie\xe2\x80\x99s client\xc3\xa8le came chiefly from the southern parishes; for the most\r\npart, people spending but a few days in the city. She prided herself\r\nupon the quality and highly respectable character of her patrons, who\r\ncame and went unobtrusively.\r\n\r\nThe large parlor opening upon the front balcony was seldom used. Her\r\nguests were permitted to entertain in this sanctuary of elegance,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthey never did. She often rented it for the night to parties of\r\nrespectable and discreet gentlemen desiring to enjoy a quiet game of\r\ncards outside the bosom of their families. The second-story hall also\r\nled by a long window out on the balcony. And Sylvie advised Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse,\r\nwhen she grew weary of her back room, to go and sit on the front\r\nbalcony, which was shady in the afternoon, and where she might find\r\ndiversion in the sounds and sights of the street below.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse refreshed herself with a bath, and was soon unpacking her few\r\nbelongings, which she ranged neatly away in the bureau drawers and the\r\narmoire.\r\n\r\nShe had revolved certain plans in her mind during the past hour or so.\r\nHer present intention was to live on indefinitely in this big, cool,\r\nclean back room on Dauphine street. She had thought seriously, for\r\nmoments, of the convent, with all readiness to embrace the vows of\r\npoverty and chastity; but what about obedience? Later, she intended, in\r\nsome round-*about way, to give her parents and her husband the assurance\r\nof her safety and welfare; reserving the right to remain unmolested and\r\nlost to them. To live on at the expense of Mont\xc3\xa9clin\xe2\x80\x99s generosity was\r\nwholly out of the question, and Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse meant to look about for some\r\nsuitable and agreeable employment.\r\n\r\nThe imperative thing to be done at present, however, was to go out in\r\nsearch of material for an inexpensive gown or two; for she found herself\r\nin the painful predicament of a young woman having almost literally\r\nnothing to wear. She decided upon pure white for one, and some sort of a\r\nsprigged muslin for the other.\r\n\r\n                                  VII.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, two days after Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in the city, she\r\nwent in to breakfast somewhat later than usual, to find two covers laid\r\nat table instead of the one to which she was accustomed. She had been to\r\nmass, and did not remove her hat, but put her fan, parasol, and\r\nprayer-book aside. The dining-room was situated just beneath her own\r\napartment, and, like all rooms of the house, was large and airy; the\r\nfloor was covered with a glistening oil-cloth.\r\n\r\nThe small, round table, immaculately set, was drawn near the open\r\nwindow. There were some tall plants in boxes on the gallery outside; and\r\nPousette, a little, old, intensely black woman, was splashing and\r\ndashing buckets of water on the flagging, and talking loud in her Creole\r\npatois to no one in particular.\r\n\r\nA dish piled with delicate river-shrimps and crushed ice was on the\r\ntable; a caraffe of crystal-clear water, a few _hors d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93uvres_, beside a\r\nsmall golden-brown crusty loaf of French bread at each plate. A\r\nhalf-bottle of wine and the morning paper were set at the place opposite\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse.\r\n\r\nShe had almost completed her breakfast when Gouvernail came in and\r\nseated himself at table. He felt annoyed at finding his cherished\r\nprivacy invaded. Sylvie was removing the remains of a mutton-chop from\r\nbefore Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, and serving her with a cup of caf\xc3\xa9 au lait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Gouvernail,\xe2\x80\x9d offered Sylvie in her most insinuating and\r\nimpressive manner, \xe2\x80\x9cyou please leave me make you acquaint\xe2\x80\x99 wid Madame\r\nCazeau. Dat\xe2\x80\x99s M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Mich\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s sister; you meet \xe2\x80\x99im two t\xe2\x80\x99ree time\xe2\x80\x99, you\r\nrec\xe2\x80\x99lec\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 been one day to de race wid \xe2\x80\x99im. Madame Cazeau, you please\r\nleave me make you acquaint\xe2\x80\x99 wid M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Gouvernail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGouvernail expressed himself greatly pleased to meet the sister of\r\nMonsieur Mich\xc3\xa9, of whom he had not the slightest recollection. He\r\ninquired after Monsieur Mich\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s health, and politely offered Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse a\r\npart of his newspaper,\xe2\x80\x94the part which contained the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Page and the\r\nsocial gossip.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse faintly remembered that Sylvie had spoken of a Monsieur\r\nGouvernail occupying the room adjoining hers, living amid luxurious\r\nsurroundings and a multitude of books. She had not thought of him\r\nfurther than to picture him a stout, middle-aged gentleman, with a bushy\r\nbeard turning gray, wearing large gold-rimmed spectacles, and stooping\r\nsomewhat from much bending over books and writing material. She had\r\nconfused him in her mind with the likeness of some literary celebrity\r\nthat she had run across in the advertising pages of a magazine.\r\n\r\nGouvernail\xe2\x80\x99s appearance was, in truth, in no sense striking. He looked\r\nolder than thirty and younger than forty, was of medium height and\r\nweight, with a quiet, unobtrusive manner which seemed to ask that he be\r\nlet alone. His hair was light brown, brushed carefully and parted in the\r\nmiddle. His mustache was brown, and so were his eyes, which had a mild,\r\npenetrating quality. He was neatly dressed in the fashion of the day;\r\nand his hands seemed to Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse remarkably white and soft for a man\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe had been buried in the contents of his newspaper, when he suddenly\r\nrealized that some further little attention might be due to Mich\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister. He started to offer her a glass of wine, when he was surprised\r\nand relieved to find that she had quietly slipped away while he was\r\nabsorbed in his own editorial on Corrupt Legislation.\r\n\r\nGouvernail finished his paper and smoked his cigar out on the gallery.\r\nHe lounged about, gathered a rose for his buttonhole, and had his\r\nregular Sunday-morning confab with Pousette, to whom he paid a weekly\r\nstipend for brushing his shoes and clothing. He made a great pretense of\r\nhaggling over the transaction, only to enjoy her uneasiness and\r\ngarrulous excitement.\r\n\r\nHe worked or read in his room for a few hours, and when he quitted the\r\nhouse, at three in the afternoon, it was to return no more till late at\r\nnight. It was his almost invariable custom to spend Sunday evenings out\r\nin the American quarter, among a congenial set of men and women,\xe2\x80\x94_des\r\nesprits forts_, all of them, whose lives were irreproachable, yet whose\r\nopinions would startle even the traditional \xe2\x80\x9csapeur,\xe2\x80\x9c for whom \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\r\nis sacred.\xe2\x80\x9d But for all his \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced\xe2\x80\x9d opinions, Gouvernail was a\r\nliberal-minded fellow; a man or woman lost nothing of his respect by\r\nbeing married.\r\n\r\nWhen he left the house in the afternoon, Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse had already ensconced\r\nherself on the front balcony. He could see her through the jalousies\r\nwhen he passed on his way to the front entrance. She had not yet grown\r\nlonesome or homesick; the newness of her surroundings made them\r\nsufficiently entertaining. She found it diverting to sit there on the\r\nfront balcony watching people pass by, even though there was no one to\r\ntalk to. And then the comforting, comfortable sense of not being\r\nmarried!\r\n\r\nShe watched Gouvernail walk down the street, and could find no fault\r\nwith his bearing. He could hear the sound of her rockers for some little\r\ndistance. He wondered what the \xe2\x80\x9cpoor little thing\xe2\x80\x9d was doing in the\r\ncity, and meant to ask Sylvie about her when he should happen to think\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, towards noon, when Gouvernail quitted his room,\r\nhe was confronted by Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, exhibiting some confusion and\r\ntrepidation at being forced to request a favor of him at so early a\r\nstage of their acquaintance. She stood in her doorway, and had evidently\r\nbeen sewing, as the thimble on her finger testified, as well as a\r\nlong-threaded needle thrust in the bosom of her gown. She held a stamped\r\nbut unaddressed letter in her hand.\r\n\r\nAnd would Mr. Gouvernail be so kind as to address the letter to her\r\nbrother, Mr. Mont\xc3\xa9clin Mich\xc3\xa9? She would hate to detain him with\r\nexplanations this morning,\xe2\x80\x94another time, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x94but now she begged\r\nthat he would give himself the trouble.\r\n\r\nHe assured her that it made no difference, that it was no trouble\r\nwhatever; and he drew a fountain pen from his pocket and addressed the\r\nletter at her dictation, resting it on the inverted rim of his straw\r\nhat. She wondered a little at a man of his supposed erudition stumbling\r\nover the spelling of \xe2\x80\x9cMont\xc3\xa9clin\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMich\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe demurred at overwhelming him with the additional trouble of posting\r\nit, but he succeeded in convincing her that so simple a task as the\r\nposting of a letter would not add an iota to the burden of the day.\r\nMoreover, he promised to carry it in his hand, and thus avoid any\r\npossible risk of forgetting it in his pocket.\r\n\r\nAfter that, and after a second repetition of the favor, when she had\r\ntold him that she had had a letter from Mont\xc3\xa9clin, and looked as if she\r\nwanted to tell him more, he felt that he knew her better. He felt that\r\nhe knew her well enough to join her out on the balcony, one night, when\r\nhe found her sitting there alone. He was not one who deliberately sought\r\nthe society of women, but he was not wholly a bear. A little\r\ncommiseration for Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s aloneness, perhaps some curiosity to know\r\nfurther what manner of woman she was, and the natural influence of her\r\nfeminine charm were equal unconfessed factors in turning his steps\r\ntowards the balcony when he discovered the shimmer of her white gown\r\nthrough the open hall window.\r\n\r\nIt was already quite late, but the day had been intensely hot, and\r\nneighboring balconies and doorways were occupied by chattering groups of\r\nhumanity, loath to abandon the grateful freshness of the outer air. The\r\nvoices about her served to reveal to Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse the feeling of loneliness\r\nthat was gradually coming over her. Notwithstanding certain dormant\r\nimpulses, she craved human sympathy and companionship.\r\n\r\nShe shook hands impulsively with Gouvernail, and told him how glad she\r\nwas to see him. He was not prepared for such an admission, but it\r\npleased him immensely, detecting as he did that the expression was as\r\nsincere as it was outspoken. He drew a chair up within comfortable\r\nconversational distance of Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse, though he had no intention of\r\ntalking more than was barely necessary to encourage Madame\xe2\x80\x94 He had\r\nactually forgotten her name!\r\n\r\nHe leaned an elbow on the balcony rail, and would have offered an\r\nopening remark about the oppressive heat of the day, but Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse did\r\nnot give him the opportunity. How glad she was to talk to some one, and\r\nhow she talked!\r\n\r\nAn hour later she had gone to her room, and Gouvernail stayed smoking on\r\nthe balcony. He knew her quite well after that hour\xe2\x80\x99s talk. It was not\r\nso much what she had said as what her half saying had revealed to his\r\nquick intelligence. He knew that she adored Mont\xc3\xa9clin, and he suspected\r\nthat she adored Cazeau without being herself aware of it. He had\r\ngathered that she was self-willed, impulsive, innocent, ignorant,\r\nunsatisfied, dissatisfied; for had she not complained that things seemed\r\nall wrongly arranged in this world, and no one was permitted to be happy\r\nin his own way? And he told her he was sorry she had discovered that\r\nprimordial fact of existence so early in life.\r\n\r\nHe commiserated her loneliness, and scanned his bookshelves next morning\r\nfor something to lend her to read, rejecting everything that offered\r\nitself to his view: Philosophy was out of the question, and so was\r\npoetry; that is, such poetry as he possessed. He had not sounded her\r\nliterary tastes, and strongly suspected she had none; that she would\r\nhave rejected The Duchess as readily as Mrs. Humphry Ward. He\r\ncompromised on a magazine.\r\n\r\nIt had entertained her passably, she admitted, upon returning it. A New\r\nEngland story had puzzled her, it was true, and a Creole tale had\r\noffended her, but the pictures had pleased her greatly, especially one\r\nwhich had reminded her so strongly of Mont\xc3\xa9clin after a hard day\xe2\x80\x99s ride\r\nthat she was loath to give it up. It was one of Remington\xe2\x80\x99s Cowboys, and\r\nGouvernail insisted upon her keeping it,\xe2\x80\x94keeping the magazine.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her daily after that, and was always eager to render her\r\nsome service or to do something towards her entertainment.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he took her out to the lake end. She had been there once,\r\nsome years before, but in winter, so the trip was comparatively new and\r\nstrange to her. The large expanse of water studded with pleasure-boats,\r\nthe sight of children playing merrily along the grassy palisades, the\r\nmusic, all enchanted her. Gouvernail thought her the most beautiful\r\nwoman he had ever seen. Even her gown\xe2\x80\x94the sprigged muslin\xe2\x80\x94appeared to\r\nhim the most charming one imaginable. Nor could anything be more\r\nbecoming than the arrangement of her brown hair under the white sailor\r\nhat, all rolled back in a soft puff from her radiant face. And she\r\ncarried her parasol and lifted her skirts and used her fan in ways that\r\nseemed quite unique and peculiar to herself, and which he considered\r\nalmost worthy of study and imitation.\r\n\r\nThey did not dine out there at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, as they might have\r\ndone, but returned early to the city to avoid the crowd. Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\r\nwanted to go home, for she said Sylvie would have dinner prepared and\r\nwould be expecting her. But it was not difficult to persuade her to dine\r\ninstead in the quiet little restaurant that he knew and liked, with its\r\nsanded floor, its secluded atmosphere, its delicious menu, and its\r\nobsequious waiter wanting to know what he might have the honor of\r\nserving to \xe2\x80\x9cmonsieur et madame.\xe2\x80\x9d No wonder he made the mistake, with\r\nGouvernail assuming such an air of proprietorship! But Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was\r\nvery tired after it all; the sparkle went out of her face, and she hung\r\ndraggingly on his arm in walking home.\r\n\r\nHe was reluctant to part from her when she bade him good-night at her\r\ndoor and thanked him for the agreeable evening. He had hoped she would\r\nsit outside until it was time for him to regain the newspaper office. He\r\nknew that she would undress and get into her peignoir and lie upon her\r\nbed; and what he wanted to do, what he would have given much to do, was\r\nto go and sit beside her, read to her something restful, soothe her, do\r\nher bidding, whatever it might be. Of course there was no use in\r\nthinking of that. But he was surprised at his growing desire to be\r\nserving her. She gave him an opportunity sooner than he looked for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gouvernail,\xe2\x80\x9d she called from her room, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you be so kine as to\r\ncall Pousette an\xe2\x80\x99 tell her she fo\xe2\x80\x99got to bring my ice-water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was indignant at Pousette\xe2\x80\x99s negligence, and called severely to her\r\nover the banisters. He was sitting before his own door, smoking. He knew\r\nthat Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse had gone to bed, for her room was dark, and she had\r\nopened the slats of the door and windows. Her bed was near a window.\r\n\r\nPousette came flopping up with the ice-water, and with a hundred\r\nexcuses: \xe2\x80\x9cMo pa oua vou \xc3\xa0 tab c\xe2\x80\x99te lanuite, mo cri vou p\xc3\xa9 gagni d\xc3\xa9ja\r\nl\xc3\xa0-bas; parole! Vou pas cri cont\xc3\xa9 \xc3\xa7a Madame Sylvie?\xe2\x80\x9d She had not seen\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse at table, and thought she was gone. She swore to this, and\r\nhoped Madame Sylvie would not be informed of her remissness.\r\n\r\nA little later Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse lifted her voice again: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gouvernail, did\r\nyou remark that young man sitting on the opposite side from us, coming\r\nin, with a gray coat an\xe2\x80\x99 a blue ban\xe2\x80\x99 aroun\xe2\x80\x99 his hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course Gouvernail had not noticed any such individual, but he assured\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse that he had observed the young fellow particularly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think he looked something,\xe2\x80\x94not very much, of co\xe2\x80\x99se,\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think he had a little faux-air of Mont\xc3\xa9clin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he looked strikingly like Mont\xc3\xa9clin,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Gouvernail, with\r\nthe one idea of prolonging the conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant to call your\r\nattention to the resemblance, and something drove it out of my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same with me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear Mont\xc3\xa9clin! I wonder\r\nw\xe2\x80\x99at he is doing now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you receive any news, any letter from him to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nGouvernail, determined that if the conversation ceased it should not be\r\nthrough lack of effort on his part to sustain it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-day, but yesterday. He tells me that maman was so distracted\r\nwith uneasiness that finally, to pacify her, he was fo\xe2\x80\x99ced to confess\r\nthat he knew w\xe2\x80\x99ere I was, but that he was boun\xe2\x80\x99 by a vow of secrecy not\r\nto reveal it. But Cazeau has not noticed him or spoken to him since he\r\nthreaten\xe2\x80\x99 to throw po\xe2\x80\x99 Mont\xc3\xa9clin in Cane river. You know Cazeau wrote me\r\na letter the morning I lef\xe2\x80\x99, thinking I had gone to the rigolet. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmaman opened it, an\xe2\x80\x99 said it was full of the mos\xe2\x80\x99 noble sentiments, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe wanted Mont\xc3\xa9clin to sen\xe2\x80\x99 it to me; but Mont\xc3\xa9clin refuse\xe2\x80\x99 poin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nblank, so he wrote to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGouvernail preferred to talk of Mont\xc3\xa9clin. He pictured Cazeau as\r\nunbearable, and did not like to think of him.\r\n\r\nA little later Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse called out, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mr. Gouvernail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned reluctantly. And when he thought that she was\r\nsleeping, he got up and went away to the midnight pandemonium of his\r\nnewspaper office.\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse could not have held out through the month had it not been for\r\nGouvernail. With the need of caution and secrecy always uppermost in her\r\nmind, she made no new acquaintances, and she did not seek out persons\r\nalready known to her; however, she knew so few, it required little\r\neffort to keep out of their way. As for Sylvie, almost every moment of\r\nher time was occupied in looking after her house; and, moreover, her\r\ndeferential attitude towards her lodgers forbade anything like the\r\ngossipy chats in which Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse might have condescended sometimes to\r\nindulge with her landlady. The transient lodgers, who came and went, she\r\nnever had occasion to meet. Hence she was entirely dependent upon\r\nGouvernail for company.\r\n\r\nHe appreciated the situation fully; and every moment that he could spare\r\nfrom his work he devoted to her entertainment. She liked to be out of\r\ndoors, and they strolled together in the summer twilight through the\r\nmazes of the old French quarter. They went again to the lake end, and\r\nstayed for hours on the water; returning so late that the streets\r\nthrough which they passed were silent and deserted. On Sunday morning he\r\narose at an unconscionable hour to take her to the French market,\r\nknowing that the sights and sounds there would interest her. And he did\r\nnot join the intellectual coterie in the afternoon, as he usually did,\r\nbut placed himself all day at the disposition and service of Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all, his manner toward her was tactful, and evinced\r\nintelligence and a deep knowledge of her character, surprising upon so\r\nbrief an acquaintance. For the time he was everything to her that she\r\nwould have him; he replaced home and friends. Sometimes she wondered if\r\nhe had ever loved a woman. She could not fancy him loving any one\r\npassionately, rudely, offensively, as Cazeau loved her. Once she was so\r\nna\xc3\xafve as to ask him outright if he had ever been in love, and he assured\r\nher promptly that he had not. She thought it an admirable trait in his\r\ncharacter, and esteemed him greatly therefor.\r\n\r\nHe found her crying one night, not openly or violently. She was leaning\r\nover the gallery rail, watching the toads that hopped about in the\r\nmoonlight, down on the damp flagstones of the courtyard. There was an\r\noppressively sweet odor rising from the cape jessamine. Pousette was\r\ndown there, mumbling and quarreling with some one, and seeming to be\r\nhaving it all her own way,\xe2\x80\x94as well she might, when her companion was\r\nonly a black cat that had come in from a neighboring yard to keep her\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse did admit feeling heart-sick, body-sick, when he questioned\r\nher; she supposed it was nothing but homesick. A letter from Mont\xc3\xa9clin\r\nhad stirred her all up. She longed for her mother, for Mont\xc3\xa9clin; she\r\nwas sick for a sight of the cotton-fields, the scent of the ploughed\r\nearth, for the dim, mysterious charm of the woods, and the old\r\ntumble-down home on the Bon Dieu.\r\n\r\nAs Gouvernail listened to her, a wave of pity and tenderness swept\r\nthrough him. He took her hands and pressed them against him. He wondered\r\nwhat would happen if he were to put his arms around her.\r\n\r\nHe was hardly prepared for what happened, but he stood it courageously.\r\nShe twined her arms around his neck and wept outright on his shoulder;\r\nthe hot tears scalding his cheek and neck, and her whole body shaken in\r\nhis arms. The impulse was powerful to strain her to him; the temptation\r\nwas fierce to seek her lips; but he did neither.\r\n\r\nHe understood a thousand times better than she herself understood it\r\nthat he was acting as substitute for Mont\xc3\xa9clin. Bitter as the conviction\r\nwas, he accepted it. He was patient; he could wait. He hoped some day to\r\nhold her with a lover\xe2\x80\x99s arms. That she was married made no particle of\r\ndifference to Gouvernail. He could not conceive or dream of it making a\r\ndifference. When the time came that she wanted him,\xe2\x80\x94as he hoped and\r\nbelieved it would come,\xe2\x80\x94he felt he would have a right to her. So long as\r\nshe did not want him, he had no right to her,\xe2\x80\x94no more than her husband\r\nhad. It was very hard to feel her warm breath and tears upon his cheek,\r\nand her struggling bosom pressed against him and her soft arms clinging\r\nto him and his whole body and soul aching for her, and yet to make no\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nHe tried to think what Mont\xc3\xa9clin would have said and done, and to act\r\naccordingly. He stroked her hair, and held her in a gentle embrace,\r\nuntil the tears dried and the sobs ended. Before releasing herself she\r\nkissed him against the neck; she had to love somebody in her own way!\r\nEven that he endured like a stoic. But it was well he left her, to\r\nplunge into the thick of rapid, breathless, exacting work till nearly\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was greatly soothed, and slept well. The touch of friendly\r\nhands and caressing arms had been very grateful. Henceforward she would\r\nnot be lonely and unhappy, with Gouvernail there to comfort her.\r\n\r\n                                   X.\r\n\r\nThe fourth week of Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s stay in the city was drawing to a close.\r\nKeeping in view the intention which she had of finding some suitable and\r\nagreeable employment, she had made a few tentatives in that direction.\r\nBut with the exception of two little girls who had promised to take\r\npiano lessons at a price that would be embarrassing to mention, these\r\nattempts had been fruitless. Moreover, the homesickness kept coming\r\nback, and Gouvernail was not always there to drive it away.\r\n\r\nShe spent much of her time weeding and pottering among the flowers down\r\nin the courtyard. She tried to take an interest in the black cat, and a\r\nmockingbird that hung in a cage outside the kitchen door, and a\r\ndisreputable parrot that belonged to the cook next door, and swore\r\nhoarsely all day long in bad French.\r\n\r\nBeside, she was not well; she was not herself, as she told Sylvie. The\r\nclimate of New Orleans did not agree with her. Sylvie was distressed to\r\nlearn this, as she felt in some measure responsible for the health and\r\nwell-being of Monsieur Mich\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s sister; and she made it her duty to\r\ninquire closely into the nature and character of Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse\xe2\x80\x99s malaise.\r\n\r\nSylvie was very wise, and Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse was very ignorant. The extent of her\r\nignorance and the depth of her subsequent enlightenment were\r\nbewildering. She stayed a long, long time quite still, quite stunned,\r\nafter her interview with Sylvie, except for the short, uneven breathing\r\nthat ruffled her bosom. Her whole being was steeped in a wave of\r\necstasy. When she finally arose from the chair in which she had been\r\nseated, and looked at herself in the mirror, a face met hers which she\r\nseemed to see for the first time, so transfigured was it with wonder and\r\nrapture.\r\n\r\nOne mood quickly followed another, in this new turmoil of her senses,\r\nand the need of action became uppermost. Her mother must know at once,\r\nand her mother must tell Mont\xc3\xa9clin. And Cazeau must know. As she thought\r\nof him, the first purely sensuous tremor of her life swept over her. She\r\nhalf whispered his name, and the sound of it brought red blotches into\r\nher cheeks. She spoke it over and over, as if it were some new, sweet\r\nsound born out of darkness and confusion, and reaching her for the first\r\ntime. She was impatient to be with him. Her whole passionate nature was\r\naroused as if by a miracle.\r\n\r\nShe seated herself to write to her husband. The letter he would get in\r\nthe morning, and she would be with him at night. What would he say? How\r\nwould he act? She knew that he would forgive her, for had he not written\r\na letter?\xe2\x80\x94and a pang of resentment toward Mont\xc3\xa9clin shot through her.\r\nWhat did he mean by withholding that letter? How dared he not have sent\r\nit?\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse attired herself for the street, and went out to post the\r\nletter which she had penned with a single thought, a spontaneous\r\nimpulse. It would have seemed incoherent to most people, but Cazeau\r\nwould understand.\r\n\r\nShe walked along the street as if she had fallen heir to some\r\nmagnificent inheritance. On her face was a look of pride and\r\nsatisfaction that passers-by noticed and admired. She wanted to talk to\r\nsome one, to tell some person; and she stopped at the corner and told\r\nthe oyster-woman, who was Irish, and who God-blessed her, and wished\r\nprosperity to the race of Cazeaus for generations to come. She held the\r\noyster-woman\xe2\x80\x99s fat, dirty little baby in her arms and scanned it\r\ncuriously and observingly, as if a baby were a phenomenon that she\r\nencountered for the first time in life. She even kissed it!\r\n\r\nThen what a relief it was to Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse to walk the streets without dread\r\nof being seen and recognized by some chance acquaintance from Red river!\r\nNo one could have said now that she did not know her own mind.\r\n\r\nShe went directly from the oyster-woman\xe2\x80\x99s to the office of Harding &\r\nOffdean, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s merchants; and it was with such an air of\r\npartnership, almost proprietorship, that she demanded a sum of money on\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s account, they gave it to her as unhesitatingly as they\r\nwould have handed it over to Cazeau himself. When Mr. Harding, who knew\r\nher, asked politely after her health, she turned so rosy and looked so\r\nconscious, he thought it a great pity for so pretty a woman to be such a\r\nlittle goose.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse entered a dry-goods store and bought all manner of\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x94little presents for nearly everybody she knew. She bought whole\r\nbolts of sheerest, softest, downiest white stuff; and when the clerk, in\r\ntrying to meet her wishes, asked if she intended it for infant\xe2\x80\x99s use,\r\nshe could have sunk through the floor, and wondered how he might have\r\nsuspected it.\r\n\r\nAs it was Mont\xc3\xa9clin who had taken her away from her husband, she wanted\r\nit to be Mont\xc3\xa9clin who should take her back to him. So she wrote him a\r\nvery curt note,\xe2\x80\x94in fact it was a postal card,\xe2\x80\x94asking that he meet her at\r\nthe train on the evening following. She felt convinced that after what\r\nhad gone before, Cazeau would await her at their own home; and she\r\npreferred it so.\r\n\r\nThen there was the agreeable excitement of getting ready to leave, of\r\npacking up her things. Pousette kept coming and going, coming and going;\r\nand each time that she quitted the room it was with something that\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse had given her,\xe2\x80\x94a handkerchief, a petticoat, a pair of\r\nstockings with two tiny holes at the toes, some broken prayer-beads, and\r\nfinally a silver dollar.\r\n\r\nNext it was Sylvie who came along bearing a gift of what she called \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nset of pattern\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94things of complicated design which never could have\r\nbeen obtained in any new-fangled bazaar or pattern-store, that Sylvie\r\nhad acquired of a foreign lady of distinction whom she had nursed years\r\nbefore at the St. Charles hotel. Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse accepted and handled them\r\nwith reverence, fully sensible of the great compliment and favor, and\r\nlaid them religiously away in the trunk which she had lately acquired.\r\n\r\nShe was greatly fatigued after the day of unusual exertion, and went\r\nearly to bed and to sleep. All day long she had not once thought of\r\nGouvernail, and only did think of him when aroused for a brief instant\r\nby the sound of his foot-falls on the gallery, as he passed in going to\r\nhis room. He had hoped to find her up, waiting for him.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning he knew. Some one must have told him. There was no\r\nsubject known to her which Sylvie hesitated to discuss in detail with\r\nany man of suitable years and discretion.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse found Gouvernail waiting with a carriage to convey her to the\r\nrailway station. A momentary pang visited her for having forgotten him\r\nso completely, when he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cSylvie tells me you are going away\r\nthis morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was kind, attentive, and amiable, as usual, but respected to the\r\nutmost the new dignity and reserve that her manner had developed since\r\nyesterday. She kept looking from the carriage window, silent, and\r\nembarrassed as Eve after losing her ignorance. He talked of the muddy\r\nstreets and the murky morning, and of Mont\xc3\xa9clin. He hoped she would find\r\neverything comfortable and pleasant in the country, and trusted she\r\nwould inform him whenever she came to visit the city again. He talked as\r\nif afraid or mistrustful of silence and himself.\r\n\r\nAt the station she handed him her purse, and he bought her ticket,\r\nsecured for her a comfortable section, checked her trunk, and got all\r\nthe bundles and things safely aboard the train. She felt very grateful.\r\nHe pressed her hand warmly, lifted his hat, and left her. He was a man\r\nof intelligence, and took defeat gracefully; that was all. But as he\r\nmade his way back to the carriage, he was thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cBy heaven, it\r\nhurts, it hurts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                                  XI.\r\n\r\nAth\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse spent a day of supreme happiness and expectancy. The fair\r\nsight of the country unfolding itself before her was balm to her vision\r\nand to her soul. She was charmed with the rather unfamiliar, broad,\r\nclean sweep of the sugar plantations, with their monster sugar-houses,\r\ntheir rows of neat cabins like little villages of a single street, and\r\ntheir impressive homes standing apart amid clusters of trees. There were\r\nsudden glimpses of a bayou curling between sunny, grassy banks, or\r\ncreeping sluggishly out from a tangled growth of wood, and brush, and\r\nfern, and poison-vines, and palmettos. And passing through the long\r\nstretches of monotonous woodlands, she would close her eyes and taste in\r\nanticipation the moment of her meeting with Cazeau. She could think of\r\nnothing but him.\r\n\r\nIt was night when she reached her station. There was Mont\xc3\xa9clin, as she\r\nhad expected, waiting for her with a two-seated buggy, to which he had\r\nhitched his own swift-footed, spirited pony. It was good, he felt, to\r\nhave her back on any terms; and he had no fault to find since she came\r\nof her own choice. He more than suspected the cause of her coming; her\r\neyes and her voice and her foolish little manner went far in revealing\r\nthe secret that was brimming over in her heart. But after he had\r\ndeposited her at her own gate, and as he continued his way toward the\r\nrigolet, he could not help feeling that the affair had taken a very\r\ndisappointing, an ordinary, a most commonplace turn, after all. He left\r\nher in Cazeau\xe2\x80\x99s keeping.\r\n\r\nHer husband lifted her out of the buggy, and neither said a word until\r\nthey stood together within the shelter of the gallery. Even then they\r\ndid not speak at first. But Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse turned to him with an appealing\r\ngesture. As he clasped her in his arms, he felt the yielding of her\r\nwhole body against him. He felt her lips for the first time respond to\r\nthe passion of his own.\r\n\r\nThe country night was dark and warm and still, save for the distant\r\nnotes of an accordion which some one was playing in a cabin away off. A\r\nlittle negro baby was crying somewhere. As Ath\xc3\xa9na\xc3\xafse withdrew from her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, the sound arrested her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Cazeau! How Juliette\xe2\x80\x99s baby is crying! Pauvre ti chou, I wonder\r\nw\xe2\x80\x99at is the matter with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            After the Winter\r\n\r\n                            After the Winter\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nTr\xc3\xa9zinie, the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, stepped out upon the gallery just\r\nas M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel passed by. He did not notice the girl but walked\r\nstraight on down the village street.\r\n\r\nHis seven hounds skulked, as usual, about him. At his side hung his\r\npowder-horn, and on his shoulder a gunny-bag slackly filled with game\r\nthat he carried to the store. A broad felt hat shaded his bearded face\r\nand in his hand he carelessly swung his old-fashioned rifle. It was\r\ndoubtless the same with which he had slain so many people, Tr\xc3\xa9zinie\r\nshudderingly reflected. For Cami, the cobbler\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x94who must have\r\nknown\xe2\x80\x94had often related to her how this man had killed two Choctaws, as\r\nmany Texans, a free mulatto and numberless blacks, in that vague\r\nlocality known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOlder people who knew better took little trouble to correct this ghastly\r\nrecord that a younger generation had scored against him. They themselves\r\nhad come to half-believe that M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel might be capable of\r\nanything, living as he had, for so many years, apart from humanity,\r\nalone with his hounds in a kennel of a cabin on the hill. The time\r\nseemed to most of them fainter than a memory when, a lusty young fellow\r\nof twenty-five, he had cultivated his strip of land across the lane from\r\nLes Ch\xc3\xaaniers; when home and toil and wife and child were so many\r\nbenedictions that he humbly thanked heaven for having given him.\r\n\r\nBut in the early \xe2\x80\x9960\xe2\x80\x99s he went with his friend Duplan and the rest of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cLouisiana Tigers.\xe2\x80\x9d He came back with some of them. He came to\r\nfind\xe2\x80\x94well, death may lurk in a peaceful valley lying in wait to ensnare\r\nthe toddling feet of little ones. Then, there are women\xe2\x80\x94there are wives\r\nwith thoughts that roam and grow wanton with roaming; women whose pulses\r\nare stirred by strange voices and eyes that woo; women who forget the\r\nclaims of yesterday, the hopes of to-morrow, in the impetuous clutch of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nBut that was no reason, some people thought, why he should have cursed\r\nmen who found their blessings where they had left them\xe2\x80\x94cursed God, who\r\nhad abandoned him.\r\n\r\nPersons who met him upon the road had long ago stopped greeting him.\r\nWhat was the use? He never answered them; he spoke to no one; he never\r\nso much as looked into men\xe2\x80\x99s faces. When he bartered his game and fish\r\nat the village store for powder and shot and such scant food as he\r\nneeded, he did so with few words and less courtesy. Yet feeble as it\r\nwas, this was the only link that held him to his fellow-beings.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the sight of M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel, though more forbidding than\r\never that delightful spring afternoon, was so suggestive to Tr\xc3\xa9zinie as\r\nto be almost an inspiration.\r\n\r\nIt was Easter eve and the early part of April. The whole earth seemed\r\nteeming with new, green, vigorous life everywhere\xe2\x80\x94except the arid spot\r\nthat immediately surrounded Tr\xc3\xa9zinie. It was no use; she had tried.\r\nNothing would grow among those cinders that filled the yard; in that\r\natmosphere of smoke and flame that was constantly belching from the\r\nforge where her father worked at his trade. There were wagon wheels,\r\nbolts and bars of iron, plowshares and all manner of unpleasant-looking\r\nthings littering the bleak, black yard; nothing green anywhere except a\r\nfew weeds that would force themselves into fence corners. And Tr\xc3\xa9zinie\r\nknew that flowers belong to Easter time, just as dyed eggs do. She had\r\nplenty of eggs; no one had more or prettier ones; she was not going to\r\ngrumble about that. But she did feel distressed because she had not a\r\nflower to help deck the altar on Easter morning. And every one else\r\nseemed to have them in such abundance! There was \xe2\x80\x99Dame Suzanne among her\r\nroses across the way. She must have clipped a hundred since noon. An\r\nhour ago Tr\xc3\xa9zinie had seen the carriage from Les Ch\xc3\xaaniers pass by on its\r\nway to church with Mamzelle Euphrasie\xe2\x80\x99s pretty head looking like a\r\npicture enframed with the Easter lilies that filled the vehicle.\r\n\r\nFor the twentieth time Tr\xc3\xa9zinie walked out upon the gallery. She saw\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel and thought of the pine hill. When she thought of the\r\nhill she thought of the flowers that grew there\xe2\x80\x94free as sunshine. The\r\ngirl gave a joyous spring that changed to a farandole as her feet\r\ntwinkled across the rough, loose boards of the gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xa9, Cami!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, clapping her hands together.\r\n\r\nCami rose from the bench where he sat pegging away at the clumsy sole of\r\na shoe, and came lazily to the fence that divided his abode from\r\nTr\xc3\xa9zinie\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, w\xe2\x80\x99at?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired with heavy amiability. She leaned far over the\r\nrailing to better communicate with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll go with me yonda on the hill to pick flowers fo\xe2\x80\x99 Easter, Cami?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to take La Fringante along, too, to he\xe2\x80\x99p with the baskets.\r\nW\xe2\x80\x99at you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d was the stolid reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m boun\xe2\x80\x99 to finish them shoe\xe2\x80\x99, if it is\r\nfo\xe2\x80\x99 a nigga.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow mo\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99 at sun-up. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ntell you, Cami, my flowers\xe2\x80\x99ll beat all! Look yonda at \xe2\x80\x99Dame Suzanne\r\npickin\xe2\x80\x99 her roses a\xe2\x80\x99ready. An\xe2\x80\x99 Mamzelle Euphraisie she\xe2\x80\x99s car\xe2\x80\x99ied her\r\nlilies an\xe2\x80\x99 gone, her. You tell me all that\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 be fresh to-moro\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJus\xe2\x80\x99 like you say,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the boy, turning to resume his work. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou want to mine out fo\xe2\x80\x99 the ole possum up in the wood. Let M\xe2\x80\x99sieu\r\nMichel set eyes on you!\xe2\x80\x9d and he raised his arms as if aiming with a gun.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPim, pam, poum! No mo\xe2\x80\x99 Tr\xc3\xa9zinie, no mo\xe2\x80\x99 Cami, no mo\xe2\x80\x99 La Fringante\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nstretch\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe possible risk which Cami so vividly foreshadowed but added a zest to\r\nTr\xc3\xa9zinie\xe2\x80\x99s projected excursion.\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly sun-up on the following morning when the three\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94Tr\xc3\xa9zinie, Cami and the little negress, La Fringante\xe2\x80\x94were\r\nfilling big, flat Indian baskets from the abundance of brilliant flowers\r\nthat studded the hill.\r\n\r\nIn their eagerness they had ascended the slope and penetrated deep into\r\nthe forest without thought of M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel or of his abode. Suddenly,\r\nin the dense wood, they came upon his hut\xe2\x80\x94low, forbidding, seeming to\r\nscowl rebuke upon them for their intrusion.\r\n\r\nLa Fringante dropped her basket, and, with a cry, fled. Cami looked as\r\nif he wanted to do the same. But Tr\xc3\xa9zinie, after the first tremor, saw\r\nthat the ogre himself was away. The wooden shutter of the one window was\r\nclosed. The door, so low that even a small man must have stooped to\r\nenter it, was secured with a chain. Absolute silence reigned, except for\r\nthe whirr of wings in the air, the fitful notes of a bird in the\r\ntreetop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see it\xe2\x80\x99s nobody there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tr\xc3\xa9zinie impatiently.\r\n\r\nLa Fringante, distracted between curiosity and terror, had crept\r\ncautiously back again. Then they all peeped through the wide chinks\r\nbetween the logs of which the cabin was built.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel had evidently begun the construction of his house by\r\nfelling a huge tree, whose remaining stump stood in the centre of the\r\nhut, and served him as a table. This primitive table was worn smooth by\r\ntwenty-five years of use. Upon it were such humble utensils as the man\r\nrequired. Everything within the hovel, the sleeping bunk, the one seat,\r\nwere as rude as a savage would have fashioned them.\r\n\r\nThe stolid Cami could have stayed for hours with his eyes fastened to\r\nthe aperture, morbidly seeking some dead, mute sign of that awful\r\npastime with which he believed M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel was accustomed to beguile\r\nhis solitude. But Tr\xc3\xa9zinie was wholly possessed by the thought of her\r\nEaster offerings. She wanted flowers and flowers, fresh with the earth\r\nand crisp with dew.\r\n\r\nWhen the three youngsters scampered down the hill again there was not a\r\npurple verbena left about M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel\xe2\x80\x99s hut; not a May apple blossom,\r\nnot a stalk of crimson phlox\xe2\x80\x94hardly a violet.\r\n\r\nHe was something of a savage, feeling that the solitude belonged to him.\r\nOf late there had been forming within his soul a sentiment toward man,\r\nkeener than indifference, bitter as hate. He was coming to dread even\r\nthat brief intercourse with others into which his traffic forced him.\r\n\r\nSo when M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel returned to his hut, and with his quick,\r\naccustomed eye saw that his woods had been despoiled, rage seized him.\r\nIt was not that he loved the flowers that were gone more than he loved\r\nthe stars, or the wind that trailed across the hill, but they belonged\r\nto and were a part of that life which he had made for himself, and which\r\nhe wanted to live alone and unmolested.\r\n\r\nDid not those flowers help him to keep his record of time that was\r\npassing? They had no right to vanish until the hot May days were upon\r\nhim. How else should he know? Why had these people, with whom he had\r\nnothing in common, intruded upon his privacy and violated it? What would\r\nthey not rob him of next?\r\n\r\nHe knew well enough it was Easter; he had heard and seen signs yesterday\r\nin the store that told him so. And he guessed that his woods had been\r\nrifled to add to the mummery of the day.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel sat himself moodily down beside his table\xe2\x80\x94centuries\r\nold\xe2\x80\x94and brooded. He did not even notice his hounds that were pleading to\r\nbe fed. As he revolved in his mind the event of the morning\xe2\x80\x94innocent as\r\nit was in itself\xe2\x80\x94it grew in importance and assumed a significance not at\r\nfirst apparent. He could not remain passive under pressure of its\r\ndisturbance. He rose to his feet, every impulse aggressive, urging him\r\nto activity. He would go down among those people all gathered together,\r\nblacks and whites, and face them for once and all. He did not know what\r\nhe would say to them, but it would be defiance\xe2\x80\x94something to voice the\r\nhate that oppressed him.\r\n\r\nThe way down the hill, then across a piece of flat, swampy woodland and\r\nthrough the lane to the village was so familiar that it required no\r\nattention from him to follow it. His thoughts were left free to revel in\r\nthe humor that had driven him from his kennel.\r\n\r\nAs he walked down the village street he saw plainly that the place was\r\ndeserted save for the appearance of an occasional negress, who seemed\r\noccupied with preparing the midday meal. But about the church scores of\r\nhorses were fastened; and M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel could see that the edifice was\r\nthronged to the very threshold.\r\n\r\nHe did not once hesitate, but obeying the force that impelled him to\r\nface the people wherever they might be, he was soon standing with the\r\ncrowd within the entrance of the church. His broad, robust shoulders had\r\nforced space for himself, and his leonine head stood higher than any\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off yo\xe2\x80\x99 hat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an indignant mulatto who addressed him. M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel\r\ninstinctively did as he was bidden. He saw confusedly that there was a\r\nmass of humanity close to him, whose contact and atmosphere affected him\r\nstrangely. He saw his wild-flowers, too. He saw them plainly, in bunches\r\nand festoons, among the Easter lilies and roses and geraniums. He was\r\ngoing to speak out, now; he had the right to and he would, just as soon\r\nas that clamor overhead would cease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBont\xc3\xa9 divine! M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered \xe2\x80\x99Dame Suzanne tragically to\r\nher neighbor. Tr\xc3\xa9zinie heard. Cami saw. They exchanged an electric\r\nglance, and tremblingly bowed their heads low.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel looked wrathfully down at the puny mulatto who had\r\nordered him to remove his hat. Why had he obeyed? That initial act of\r\ncompliance had somehow weakened his will, his resolution. But he would\r\nregain firmness just as soon as that clamor above gave him chance to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nIt was the organ filling the small edifice with volumes of sound. It was\r\nthe voices of men and women mingling in the \xe2\x80\x9cGloria in excelsis Deo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words bore no meaning for him apart from the old familiar strain\r\nwhich he had known as a child and chanted himself in that same\r\norgan-loft years ago. How it went on and on. Would it never cease? It\r\nwas like a menace; like a voice reaching out from the dead past to taunt\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGloria in excelsis Deo!\xe2\x80\x9d over and over! How the deep basso rolled it\r\nout! How the tenor and alto caught it up and passed it on to be lifted\r\nby the high, flute-like ring of the soprano, till all mingled again in\r\nthe wild p\xc3\xa6an, \xe2\x80\x9cGloria in excelsis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow insistent was the refrain! and where, what, was that mysterious,\r\nhidden quality in it; the power which was overcoming M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel,\r\nstirring within him a turmoil that bewildered him?\r\n\r\nThere was no use in trying to speak, or in wanting to. His throat could\r\nnot have uttered a sound. He wanted to escape, that was all. \xe2\x80\x9cBon\xc3\xa6\r\nvoluntatis,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he bent his head as if before a beating storm. \xe2\x80\x9cGloria!\r\nGloria! Gloria!\xe2\x80\x9d He must fly; he must save himself, regain his hill\r\nwhere sights and odors and sounds and saints or devils would cease to\r\nmolest him. \xe2\x80\x9cIn excelsis Deo!\xe2\x80\x9d He retreated, forcing his way backward to\r\nthe door. He dragged his hat down over his eyes and staggered away down\r\nthe road. But the refrain pursued him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cax! pax! pax!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94fretting him like\r\na lash. He did not slacken his pace till the tones grew fainter than an\r\necho, floating, dying away in an \xe2\x80\x9cin excelsis!\xe2\x80\x9d When he could hear it no\r\nlonger he stopped and breathed a sigh of rest and relief.\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\nAll day long M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel stayed about his hut engaged in some\r\nfamiliar employment that he hoped might efface the unaccountable\r\nimpressions of the morning. But his restlessness was unbounded. A\r\nlonging had sprung up within him as sharp as pain and not to be\r\nappeased. At once, on this bright, warm Easter morning the voices that\r\ntill now had filled his solitude became meaningless. He stayed mute and\r\nuncomprehending before them. Their significance had vanished before the\r\ndriving want for human sympathy and companionship that had reawakened in\r\nhis soul.\r\n\r\nWhen night came on he walked through the woods down the slant of the\r\nhill again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt mus\xe2\x80\x99 be all fill\xe2\x80\x99 up with weeds,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel to himself\r\nas he went. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Bon Dieu! with trees, Michel, with trees\xe2\x80\x94in twenty-five\r\nyears, man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not taken the road to the village, but was pursuing a different\r\none in which his feet had not walked for many days. It led him along the\r\nriver bank for a distance. The narrow stream, stirred by the restless\r\nbreeze, gleamed in the moonlight that was flooding the land.\r\n\r\nAs he went on and on, the scent of the new-plowed earth that had been\r\nfrom the first keenly perceptible, began to intoxicate him. He wanted to\r\nkneel and bury his face in it. He wanted to dig into it; turn it over.\r\nHe wanted to scatter the seed again as he had done long ago, and watch\r\nthe new, green life spring up as if at his bidding.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned away from the river and had walked a piece down the lane\r\nthat divided Joe Duplan\xe2\x80\x99s plantation from that bit of land that had once\r\nbeen his, he wiped his eyes to drive away the mist that was making him\r\nsee things as they surely could not be.\r\n\r\nHe had wanted to plant a hedge that time before he went away, but he had\r\nnot done so. Yet there was the hedge before him, just as he had meant it\r\nto be, and filling the night with fragrance. A broad, low gate divided\r\nits length, and over this he leaned and looked before him in amazement.\r\nThere were no weeds as he had fancied; no trees except the scattered\r\nlive oaks that he remembered.\r\n\r\nCould that row of hardy fig trees, old, squat and gnarled, be the twigs\r\nthat he himself had set one day into the ground? One raw December day\r\nwhen there was a fine, cold mist falling. The chill of it breathed again\r\nupon him; the memory was so real. The land did not look as if it ever\r\nhad been plowed for a field. It was a smooth, green meadow, with cattle\r\nhuddled upon the cool sward, or moving with slow, stately tread as they\r\nnibbled the tender shoots.\r\n\r\nThere was the house unchanged, gleaming white in the moon, seeming to\r\ninvite him beneath its calm shelter. He wondered who dwelt within it\r\nnow. Whoever it was he would not have them find him, like a prowler,\r\nthere at the gate. But he would come again and again like this at\r\nnighttime, to gaze and refresh his spirit.\r\n\r\nA hand had been laid upon M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and some one called\r\nhis name. Startled, he turned to see who accosted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuplan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men who had not exchanged speech for so many years stood facing\r\neach other for a long moment in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would come back some day, Michel. It was a long time to\r\nwait, but you have come home at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel cowered instinctively and lifted his hands with\r\nexpressive deprecatory gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; it\xe2\x80\x99s no place for me, Joe; no\r\nplace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t a man\xe2\x80\x99s home a place for him, Michel?\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed less a question\r\nthan an assertion, charged with gentle authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five years, Duplan; twenty-five years! It\xe2\x80\x99s no use; it\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nlate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I have used it,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the planter, quietly, ignoring\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel\xe2\x80\x99s protestations. \xe2\x80\x9cThose are my cattle grazing off there.\r\nThe house has served me many a time to lodge guests or workmen, for whom\r\nI had no room at Les Ch\xc3\xaaniers. I have not exhausted the soil with any\r\ncrops. I had not the right to do that. Yet am I in your debt, Michel,\r\nand ready to settle en bon ami.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe planter had opened the gate and entered the inclosure, leading\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel with him. Together they walked toward the house.\r\n\r\nLanguage did not come readily to either\xe2\x80\x94one so unaccustomed to hold\r\nintercourse with men; both so stirred with memories that would have\r\nrendered any speech painful. When they had stayed long in a silence\r\nwhich was eloquent of tenderness, Joe Duplan spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know how I tried to see you, Michel, to speak with you, and you\r\nnever would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel answered with but a gesture that seemed a supplication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the past all go, Michel. Begin your new life as if the twenty-five\r\nyears that are gone had been a long night, from which you have only\r\nawakened. Come to me in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with quick resolution,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor a horse and a plow.\xe2\x80\x9d He had taken the key of the house from his\r\npocket and placed it in M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA horse?\xe2\x80\x9d M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel repeated uncertainly; \xe2\x80\x9ca plow! Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nlate, Duplan; too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t too late. The land has rested all these years, man; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfresh, I tell you; and rich as gold. Your crop will be the finest in the\r\nland.\xe2\x80\x9d He held out his hand and M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Michel pressed it without a word\r\nin reply, save a muttered \xe2\x80\x9cMon ami.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he stood there watching the planter disappear behind the high,\r\nclipped hedge.\r\n\r\nHe held out his arms. He could not have told if it was toward the\r\nretreating figure, or in welcome to an infinite peace that seemed to\r\ndescend upon him and envelop him.\r\n\r\nAll the land was radiant except the hill far off that was in black\r\nshadow against the sky.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                Polydore\r\n\r\n                                Polydore\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was often said that Polydore was the stupidest boy to be found \xe2\x80\x9cfrom\r\nthe mouth of Cane river plumb to Natchitoches.\xe2\x80\x9d Hence it was an easy\r\nmatter to persuade him, as meddlesome and mischievous people sometimes\r\ntried to do, that he was an overworked and much abused individual.\r\n\r\nIt occurred one morning to Polydore to wonder what would happen if he\r\ndid not get up. He hardly expected the world to stop turning on its\r\naxis; but he did in a way believe that the machinery of the whole\r\nplantation would come to a standstill.\r\n\r\nHe had awakened at the usual hour,\xe2\x80\x94about daybreak,\xe2\x80\x94and instead of\r\ngetting up at once, as was his custom, he re-settled himself between the\r\nsheets. There he lay, peering out through the dormer window into the\r\ngray morning that was deliciously cool after the hot summer night,\r\nlistening to familiar sounds that came from the barn-yard, the fields\r\nand woods beyond, heralding the approach of day.\r\n\r\nA little later there were other sounds, no less familiar or significant;\r\nthe roll of the wagon-wheels; the distant call of a negro\xe2\x80\x99s voice; Aunt\r\nSiney\xe2\x80\x99s shuffling step as she crossed the gallery, bearing to Mamzelle\r\nAd\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde and old Monsieur Jos\xc3\xa9 their early coffee.\r\n\r\nPolydore had formed no plan and had thought only vaguely upon results.\r\nHe lay in a half-slumber awaiting developments, and philosophically\r\nresigned to any turn which the affair might take. Still he was not quite\r\nready with an answer when Jude came and thrust his head in at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMista Polydore! O Mista Polydore! You \xe2\x80\x99sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan \xe2\x80\x99low he ain\xe2\x80\x99 gwine wait yonda wid de wagon all day. Say does you\r\ninspect \xe2\x80\x99im to pack dat freight f\xe2\x80\x99om de landing by hisse\xe2\x80\x99f?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon he got it to do, Jude. I ain\xe2\x80\x99 going to get up, me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99 gwine git up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99m sick. I\xe2\x80\x99m going stay in bed. Go \xe2\x80\x99long and le\xe2\x80\x99 me sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next one to invade Polydore\xe2\x80\x99s privacy was Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde herself.\r\nIt was no small effort for her to mount the steep, narrow stairway to\r\nPolydore\xe2\x80\x99s room. She seldom penetrated to these regions under the roof.\r\nHe could hear the stairs creak beneath her weight, and knew that she was\r\npanting at every step. Her presence seemed to crowd the small room; for\r\nshe was stout and rather tall, and her flowing muslin wrapper swept\r\nmajestically from side to side as she walked.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde had reached middle age, but her face was still fresh\r\nwith its mignon features; and her brown eyes at the moment were round\r\nwith astonishment and alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s that I hear, Polydore? They tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re sick!\xe2\x80\x9d She went and\r\nstood beside the bed, lifting the mosquito bar that settled upon her\r\nhead and fell about her like a veil.\r\n\r\nPolydore\xe2\x80\x99s eyes blinked, and he made no attempt to answer. She felt his\r\nwrist softly with the tips of her fingers, and rested her hand for a\r\nmoment on his low forehead beneath the shock of black hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have any fever, Polydore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d hesitatingly, feeling himself forced to make some reply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nkine of\xe2\x80\x94a kine of pain, like you might say. It kitch me yere in the\r\nknee, and it goes \xe2\x80\x99long like you stickin\xe2\x80\x99 a knife clean down in my heel.\r\nAie! Oh, la-la!\xe2\x80\x9d expressions of pain wrung from him by Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde\r\ngently pushing aside the covering to examine the afflicted member.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy patience! but that leg is swollen, yes, Polydore.\xe2\x80\x9d The limb, in\r\nfact, seemed dropsical, but if Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde had bethought her of\r\ncomparing it with the other one, she would have found the two\r\ncorresponding in their proportions to a nicety. Her kind face expressed\r\nthe utmost concern, and she quitted Polydore feeling pained and ill at\r\nease.\r\n\r\nFor one of the aims of Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde\xe2\x80\x99s existence was to do the right\r\nthing by this boy, whose mother, a \xe2\x80\x99Cadian hill woman, had begged her\r\nwith dying breath to watch over the temporal and spiritual welfare of\r\nher son; above all, to see that he did not follow in the slothful\r\nfootsteps of an over-indolent father.\r\n\r\nPolydore\xe2\x80\x99s scheme worked so marvellously to his comfort and pleasure\r\nthat he wondered at not having thought of it before. He ate with keen\r\nrelish the breakfast which Jude brought to him on a tray. Even old\r\nMonsieur Jos\xc3\xa9 was concerned, and made his way up to Polydore, bringing a\r\nnumber of picture-papers for his entertainment, a palm-leaf fan and a\r\ncow-bell, with which to summon Jude when necessary and which he placed\r\nwithin easy reach.\r\n\r\nAs Polydore lay on his back fanning luxuriously, it seemed to him that\r\nhe was enjoying a foretaste of paradise. Only once did he shudder with\r\napprehension. It was when he heard Aunt Siney, with lifted voice,\r\nrecommending to \xe2\x80\x9cwrop the laig up in bacon fat; de oniest way to draw\r\nout de misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thought of a healthy leg swathed in bacon fat on a hot day in July\r\nwas enough to intimidate a braver heart than Polydore\xe2\x80\x99s. But the\r\nsuggestion was evidently not adopted, for he heard no more of the bacon\r\nfat. In its stead he became acquainted with the not unpleasant sting of\r\na soothing liniment which Jude rubbed into the leg at intervals during\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nHe kept the limb propped on a pillow, stiff and motionless, even when\r\nalone and unobserved. Toward evening he fancied that it really showed\r\nsigns of inflammation, and he was quite sure it pained him.\r\n\r\nIt was a satisfaction to all to see Polydore appear down-stairs the\r\nfollowing afternoon. He limped painfully, it is true, and clutched\r\nwildly at anything in his way that offered a momentary support. His\r\nacting was clumsily overdrawn; and by less guileless souls than Mamzelle\r\nAd\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde and her father would have surely been suspected. But these two\r\nonly thought with deep concern of means to make him comfortable.\r\n\r\nThey seated him on the shady back gallery in an easy-chair, with his leg\r\npropped up before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe inhe\xe2\x80\x99its dat rheumatism,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed Aunt Siney, who affected the\r\nmanner of an oracle. \xe2\x80\x9cI see dat boy\xe2\x80\x99s granpap, many times, all twis\xe2\x80\x99 up\r\nwid rheumatism twell his head sot down on his body, hine side befo\xe2\x80\x99. He\r\ngot to keep outen de jew in de mo\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99s, and he \xe2\x80\x99bleege to w\xe2\x80\x99ar red\r\nflannen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Jos\xc3\xa9, with flowing white locks enframing his aged face, leaned\r\nupon his cane and contemplated the boy with unflagging attention.\r\nPolydore was beginning to believe himself a worthy object as a center of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde had but just returned from a long drive in the open\r\nbuggy, from a mission which would have fallen to Polydore had he not\r\nbeen disabled by this unlooked-for illness. She had thoughtlessly driven\r\nacross the country at an hour when the sun was hottest, and now she sat\r\npanting and fanning herself; her face, which she mopped incessantly with\r\nher handkerchief, was inflamed from the heat.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde ate no supper that night, and went to bed early, with\r\na compress of _eau s\xc3\xa9dative_ bound tightly around her head. She thought\r\nit was a simple headache, and that she would be rid of it in the\r\nmorning; but she was not better in the morning.\r\n\r\nShe kept her bed that day, and late in the afternoon Jude rode over to\r\ntown for the doctor, and stopped on the way to tell Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarried sister that she was quite ill, and would like to have her come\r\ndown to the plantation for a day or two.\r\n\r\nPolydore made round, serious eyes and forgot to limp. He wanted to go\r\nfor the doctor in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s stead; but Aunt Siney, assuming a brief\r\nauthority, forced him to sit still by the kitchen door and talked\r\nfurther of bacon fat.\r\n\r\nOld Monsieur Jos\xc3\xa9 moved about uneasily and restlessly, in and out of his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s room. He looked vacantly at Polydore now, as if the stout\r\nyoung boy in blue jeans and a calico shirt were a sort of a\r\ntransparency.\r\n\r\nA dawning anxiety, coupled to the inertia of the past two days, deprived\r\nPolydore of his usual healthful night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. The slightest noises awoke\r\nhim. Once it was the married sister breaking ice down on the gallery.\r\nOne of the hands had been sent with the cart for ice late in the\r\nafternoon; and Polydore himself had wrapped the huge chunk in an old\r\nblanket and set it outside of Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nTroubled and wakeful, he arose from bed and went and stood by the open\r\nwindow. There was a round moon in the sky, shedding its pale glamor over\r\nall the country; and the live-oak branches, stirred by the restless\r\nbreeze, flung quivering, grotesque shadows slanting across the old roof.\r\nA mocking-bird had been singing for hours near Polydore\xe2\x80\x99s window, and\r\nfarther away there were frogs croaking. He could see as through a\r\nsilvery gauze the level stretch of the cotton-field, ripe and white; a\r\ngleam of water beyond,\xe2\x80\x94that was the bend of the river,\xe2\x80\x94and farther yet,\r\nthe gentle rise of the pine hill.\r\n\r\nThere was a cabin up there on the hill that Polydore remembered well.\r\nNegroes were living in it now, but it had been his home once. Life had\r\nbeen pinched and wretched enough up there with the little chap. The\r\nbright days had been the days when his godmother, Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde,\r\nwould come driving her old white horse over the pine needles and\r\ncrackling fallen twigs of the deserted hill-road. Her presence was\r\nconnected with the earliest recollections of whatever he had known of\r\ncomfort and well-being.\r\n\r\nAnd one day when death had taken his mother from him, Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde\r\nhad brought him home to live with her always. Now she was sick down\r\nthere in her room; very sick, for the doctor had said so, and the\r\nmarried sister had put on her longest face.\r\n\r\nPolydore did not think of these things in any connected or very\r\nintelligent way. They were only impressions that penetrated him and made\r\nhis heart swell, and the tears well up to his eyes. He wiped his eyes on\r\nthe sleeve of his night-gown. The mosquitoes were stinging him and\r\nraising great welts on his brown legs. He went and crept back under the\r\nmosquito-bar, and soon he was asleep and dreaming that his _n\xc3\xa9naine_ was\r\ndead and he left alone in the cabin upon the pine hill.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, after the doctor had seen Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde, he went and\r\nturned his horse into the lot and prepared to stay with his patient\r\nuntil he could feel it would be prudent to leave her.\r\n\r\nPolydore tiptoed into her room and stood at the foot of the bed. Nobody\r\nnoticed now whether he limped or not. She was talking very loud, and he\r\ncould not believe at first that she could be as ill as they said, with\r\nsuch strength of voice. But her tones were unnatural, and what she said\r\nconveyed no meaning to his ears.\r\n\r\nHe understood, however, when she thought she was talking to his mother.\r\nShe was in a manner apologizing for his illness; and seemed to be\r\ntroubled with the idea that she had in a way been the indirect cause of\r\nit by some oversight or neglect.\r\n\r\nPolydore felt ashamed, and went outside and stood by himself near the\r\ncistern till some one told him to go and attend to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s horse.\r\n\r\nThen there was confusion in the household, when mornings and afternoons\r\nseemed turned around; and meals, which were scarcely tasted, were served\r\nat irregular and unseasonable hours. And there came one awful night,\r\nwhen they did not know if Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde would live or die.\r\n\r\nNobody slept. The doctor snatched moments of rest in the hammock. He and\r\nthe priest, who had been summoned, talked a little together with\r\nprofessional callousness about the dry weather and the crops.\r\n\r\nOld monsieur walked, walked, like a restless, caged animal. The married\r\nsister came out on the gallery every now and then and leaned up against\r\nthe post and sobbed in her handkerchief. There were many negroes around,\r\nsitting on the steps and standing in small groups in the yard.\r\n\r\nPolydore crouched on the gallery. It had finally come to him to\r\ncomprehend the cause of his _n\xc3\xa9naine\xe2\x80\x99s_ sickness\xe2\x80\x94that drive in the\r\nsweltering afternoon, when he was shamming illness. No one there could\r\nhave comprehended the horror of himself, the terror that possessed him,\r\nsquatting there outside her door like a savage. If she died\xe2\x80\x94but he could\r\nnot think of that. It was the point at which his reason was stunned and\r\nseemed to swoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nA week or two later Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde was sitting outside for the first\r\ntime since her convalescence began. They had brought her own rocker\r\naround to the side where she could get a sight and whiff of the\r\nflower-garden and the blossom-laden rose-vine twining in and out of the\r\nbanisters. Her former plumpness had not yet returned, and she looked\r\nmuch older, for the wrinkles were visible.\r\n\r\nShe was watching Polydore cross the yard. He had been putting up his\r\npony. He approached with his heavy, clumsy walk; his round, simple face\r\nwas hot and flushed from the ride. When he had mounted to the gallery he\r\nwent and leaned against the railing, facing Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde, mopping\r\nhis face, his hands and neck with his handkerchief. Then he removed his\r\nhat and began to fan himself with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be perfec\xe2\x80\x99ly cu\xe2\x80\x99ed of yo\xe2\x80\x99 rheumatism, Polydore. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhurt you any mo\xe2\x80\x99, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned.\r\n\r\nHe stamped the foot and extended the leg violently, in proof of its\r\nperfect soundness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know w\xe2\x80\x99ere I been, _n\xc3\xa9naine_?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI been to confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. Now you mus\xe2\x80\x99 rememba and not take a drink of water\r\nto-morrow morning, as you did las\xe2\x80\x99 time, and miss yo\xe2\x80\x99 communion, my boy.\r\nYou are a good child, Polydore, to go like that to confession without\r\nbein told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I ain\xe2\x80\x99 good,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, doggedly. He began to twirl his hat on\r\none finger. \xe2\x80\x9cP\xc3\xa8re Cassimelle say he always yeard I was stupid, but he\r\nnever knew befo\xe2\x80\x99 how bad I been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde, not over well pleased with the\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me a long penance,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Polydore. \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Litany of the\r\nSaint\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Litany of the Blessed Virgin,\xe2\x80\x99 and three \xe2\x80\x98Our Father\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand three \xe2\x80\x98Hail Mary\xe2\x80\x99 to say ev\xe2\x80\x99ry mo\xe2\x80\x99ning fo\xe2\x80\x99 a week. But he say\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99 enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy patience! W\xe2\x80\x99at does he expec\xe2\x80\x99 mo\xe2\x80\x99 from you, I like to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPolydore was now creasing and scanning his hat attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe say\xe2\x80\x99 w\xe2\x80\x99at I need, it\xe2\x80\x99s to be wo\xe2\x80\x99 out with the raw-hide. He say\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nknows M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Jos\xc3\xa9 is too ole and feeble to give it to me like I\r\ndeserve; and if you want, he say\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to give me a good tas\xe2\x80\x99e\r\nof the raw-hide himse\xe2\x80\x99f.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde found it impossible to disguise her indignation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xc3\xa8re Cassimelle sho\xe2\x80\x99ly fo\xe2\x80\x99gets himse\xe2\x80\x99f, Polydore. Don\xe2\x80\x99t repeat to me\r\nany further his inconsid\xe2\x80\x99ate remarks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s right, _n\xc3\xa9naine_. P\xc3\xa8re Cassimelle is right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince the night he crouched outside her door, Polydore had lived with\r\nthe weight of his unconfessed fault oppressing every moment of\r\nexistence. He had tried to rid himself of it in going to Father\r\nCassimelle; but that had only helped by indicating the way. He was\r\nawkward and unaccustomed to express emotions with coherent speech. The\r\nwords would not come.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he flung his hat to the ground, and falling on his knees, began\r\nto sob, with his face pressed down in Mamzelle Ad\xc3\xa9la\xc3\xafde\xe2\x80\x99s lap. She had\r\nnever seen him cry before, and in her weak condition it made her\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\nThen somehow he got it out; he told the whole story of his deceit. He\r\ntold it simply, in a way that bared his heart to her for the first time.\r\nShe said nothing; only held his hand close and stroked his hair. But she\r\nfelt as if a kind of miracle had happened. Hitherto her first thought in\r\ncaring for this boy had been a desire to fulfill his dead mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nBut now he seemed to belong to herself, and to be her very own. She knew\r\nthat a bond of love had been forged that would hold them together\r\nalways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I can\xe2\x80\x99t he\xe2\x80\x99p being stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Polydore, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s no call\r\nfo\xe2\x80\x99 me to be bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeva mine, Polydore; neva mine, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and she drew him close to her\r\nand kissed him as mothers kiss.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                 Regret\r\n\r\n                                 Regret\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie possessed a good strong figure, ruddy cheeks, hair that\r\nwas changing from brown to gray, and a determined eye. She wore a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhat about the farm, and an old blue army overcoat when it was cold, and\r\nsometimes top-boots.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie had never thought of marrying. She had never been in\r\nlove. At the age of twenty she had received a proposal, which she had\r\npromptly declined, and at the age of fifty she had not yet lived to\r\nregret it.\r\n\r\nSo she was quite alone in the world, except for her dog Ponto, and the\r\nnegroes who lived in her cabins and worked her crops, and the fowls, a\r\nfew cows, a couple of mules, her gun (with which she shot\r\nchicken-hawks), and her religion.\r\n\r\nOne morning Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie stood upon her gallery, contemplating, with\r\narms akimbo, a small band of very small children who, to all intents and\r\npurposes, might have fallen from the clouds, so unexpected and\r\nbewildering was their coming, and so unwelcome. They were the children\r\nof her nearest neighbor, Odile, who was not such a near neighbor, after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe young woman had appeared but five minutes before, accompanied by\r\nthese four children. In her arms she carried little Elodie; she dragged\r\nTi Nomme by an unwilling hand; while Marc\xc3\xa9line and Marc\xc3\xa9lette followed\r\nwith irresolute steps.\r\n\r\nHer face was red and disfigured from tears and excitement. She had been\r\nsummoned to a neighboring parish by the dangerous illness of her mother;\r\nher husband was away in Texas\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to her a million miles away; and\r\nValsin was waiting with the mule-cart to drive her to the station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no question, Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie; you jus\xe2\x80\x99 got to keep those\r\nyoungsters fo\xe2\x80\x99 me tell I come back. Dieu sait, I would n\xe2\x80\x99 botha you with\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em if it was any otha way to do! Make \xe2\x80\x99em mine you, Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99 spare \xe2\x80\x99em. Me, there, I\xe2\x80\x99m half crazy between the chil\xe2\x80\x99ren, an\xe2\x80\x99 L\xc3\xa9on\r\nnot home, an\xe2\x80\x99 maybe not even to fine po\xe2\x80\x99 maman alive encore!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nharrowing possibility which drove Odile to take a final hasty and\r\nconvulsive leave of her disconsolate family.\r\n\r\nShe left them crowded into the narrow strip of shade on the porch of the\r\nlong, low house; the white sunlight was beating in on the white old\r\nboards; some chickens were scratching in the grass at the foot of the\r\nsteps, and one had boldly mounted, and was stepping heavily, solemnly,\r\nand aimlessly across the gallery. There was a pleasant odor of pinks in\r\nthe air, and the sound of negroes\xe2\x80\x99 laughter was coming across the\r\nflowering cotton-field.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie stood contemplating the children. She looked with a\r\ncritical eye upon Marc\xc3\xa9line, who had been left staggering beneath the\r\nweight of the chubby Elodie. She surveyed with the same calculating air\r\nMarc\xc3\xa9lette mingling her silent tears with the audible grief and\r\nrebellion of Ti Nomme. During those few contemplative moments she was\r\ncollecting herself, determining upon a line of action which should be\r\nidentical with a line of duty. She began by feeding them.\r\n\r\nIf Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities might have begun and ended there,\r\nthey could easily have been dismissed; for her larder was amply provided\r\nagainst an emergency of this nature. But little children are not little\r\npigs; they require and demand attentions which were wholly unexpected by\r\nMamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie, and which she was ill prepared to give.\r\n\r\nShe was, indeed, very inapt in her management of Odile\xe2\x80\x99s children during\r\nthe first few days. How could she know that Marc\xc3\xa9lette always wept when\r\nspoken to in a loud and commanding tone of voice? It was a peculiarity\r\nof Marc\xc3\xa9lette\xe2\x80\x99s. She became acquainted with Ti Nomme\xe2\x80\x99s passion for\r\nflowers only when he had plucked all the choicest gardenias and pinks\r\nfor the apparent purpose of critically studying their botanical\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTain\xe2\x80\x99t enough to tell \xe2\x80\x99im, Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie,\xe2\x80\x9d Marc\xc3\xa9line instructed her;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou got to tie \xe2\x80\x99im in a chair. It\xe2\x80\x99s w\xe2\x80\x99at maman all time do w\xe2\x80\x99en he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbad: she tie \xe2\x80\x99im in a chair.\xe2\x80\x9d The chair in which Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie tied\r\nTi Nomme was roomy and comfortable, and he seized the opportunity to\r\ntake a nap in it, the afternoon being warm.\r\n\r\nAt night, when she ordered them one and all to bed as she would have\r\nshooed the chickens into the hen-house, they stayed uncomprehending\r\nbefore her. What about the little white nightgowns that had to be taken\r\nfrom the pillow-slip in which they were brought over, and shaken by some\r\nstrong hand till they snapped like ox-whips? What about the tub of water\r\nwhich had to be brought and set in the middle of the floor, in which the\r\nlittle tired, dusty, sunbrowned feet had every one to be washed sweet\r\nand clean? And it made Marc\xc3\xa9line and Marc\xc3\xa9lette laugh merrily\xe2\x80\x94the idea\r\nthat Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie should for a moment have believed that Ti Nomme\r\ncould fall asleep without being told the story of _Croque-mitaine_ or\r\n_Loup-garou_, or both; or that Elodie could fall asleep at all without\r\nbeing rocked and sung to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Aunt Ruby,\xe2\x80\x9d Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie informed her cook in\r\nconfidence; \xe2\x80\x9cme, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather manage a dozen plantation\xe2\x80\x99 than fo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nchil\xe2\x80\x99ren. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrassent! Bont\xc3\xa9! Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me about chil\xe2\x80\x99ren!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99 ispected sich as you would know airy thing \xe2\x80\x99bout \xe2\x80\x99em, Mamzelle\r\nAur\xc3\xa9lie. I see dat plainly yistiddy w\xe2\x80\x99en I spy dat li\xe2\x80\x99le chile playin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwid yo\xe2\x80\x99 baskit o\xe2\x80\x99 keys. You don\xe2\x80\x99 know dat makes chillun grow up\r\nhard-headed, to play wid keys? Des like it make \xe2\x80\x99em teeth hard to look\r\nin a lookin\xe2\x80\x99-glass. Them\xe2\x80\x99s the things you got to know in the raisin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmanigement o\xe2\x80\x99 chillun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie certainly did not pretend or aspire to such subtle and\r\nfar-reaching knowledge on the subject as Aunt Ruby possessed, who had\r\n\xe2\x80\x9craised five an\xe2\x80\x99 bared (buried) six\xe2\x80\x9d in her day. She was glad enough to\r\nlearn a few little mother-tricks to serve the moment\xe2\x80\x99s need.\r\n\r\nTi Nomme\xe2\x80\x99s sticky fingers compelled her to unearth white aprons that she\r\nhad not worn for years, and she had to accustom herself to his moist\r\nkisses\xe2\x80\x94the expressions of an affectionate and exuberant nature. She got\r\ndown her sewing-basket, which she seldom used, from the top shelf of the\r\narmoire, and placed it within the ready and easy reach which torn slips\r\nand buttonless waists demanded. It took her some days to become\r\naccustomed to the laughing, the crying, the chattering that echoed\r\nthrough the house and around it all day long. And it was not the first\r\nor the second night that she could sleep comfortably with little\r\nElodie\xe2\x80\x99s hot, plump body pressed close against her, and the little one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwarm breath beating her cheek like the fanning of a bird\xe2\x80\x99s wing.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of two weeks Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie had grown quite used to\r\nthese things, and she no longer complained.\r\n\r\nIt was also at the end of two weeks that Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie, one evening,\r\nlooking away toward the crib where the cattle were being fed, saw\r\nValsin\xe2\x80\x99s blue cart turning the bend of the road. Odile sat beside the\r\nmulatto, upright and alert. As they drew near, the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s beaming\r\nface indicated that her homecoming was a happy one.\r\n\r\nBut this coming, unannounced and unexpected, threw Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie into\r\na flutter that was almost agitation. The children had to be gathered.\r\nWhere was Ti Nomme? Yonder in the shed, putting an edge on his knife at\r\nthe grindstone. And Marc\xc3\xa9line and Marc\xc3\xa9lette? Cutting and fashioning\r\ndoll-rags in the corner of the gallery. As for Elodie, she was safe\r\nenough in Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie\xe2\x80\x99s arms; and she had screamed with delight at\r\nsight of the familiar blue cart which was bringing her mother back to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe excitement was all over, and they were gone. How still it was when\r\nthey were gone! Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie stood upon the gallery, looking and\r\nlistening. She could no longer see the cart; the red sunset and the\r\nblue-gray twilight had together flung a purple mist across the fields\r\nand road that hid it from her view. She could no longer hear the\r\nwheezing and creaking of its wheels. But she could still faintly hear\r\nthe shrill, glad voices of the children.\r\n\r\nShe turned into the house. There was much work awaiting her, for the\r\nchildren had left a sad disorder behind them; but she did not at once\r\nset about the task of righting it. Mamzelle Aur\xc3\xa9lie seated herself\r\nbeside the table. She gave one slow glance through the room, into which\r\nthe evening shadows were creeping and deepening around her solitary\r\nfigure. She let her head fall down upon her bended arm, and began to\r\ncry. Oh, but she cried! Not softly, as women often do. She cried like a\r\nman, with sobs that seemed to tear her very soul. She did not notice\r\nPonto licking her hand.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                         A Matter of Prejudice\r\n\r\n                         A Matter of Prejudice\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Carambeau wanted it strictly understood that she was not to be\r\ndisturbed by Gustave\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party. They carried her big\r\nrocking-chair from the back gallery, that looked out upon the garden\r\nwhere the children were going to play, around to the front gallery,\r\nwhich closely faced the green levee bank and the Mississippi coursing\r\nalmost flush with the top of it.\r\n\r\nThe house\xe2\x80\x94an old Spanish one, broad, low and completely encircled by a\r\nwide gallery\xe2\x80\x94was far down in the French quarter of New Orleans. It stood\r\nupon a square of ground that was covered thick with a semi-tropical\r\ngrowth of plants and flowers. An impenetrable board fence, edged with a\r\nformidable row of iron spikes, shielded the garden from the prying\r\nglances of the occasional passer-by.\r\n\r\nMadame Carambeau\xe2\x80\x99s widowed daughter, Madame C\xc3\xa9cile Lalonde, lived with\r\nher. This annual party, given to her little son, Gustave, was the one\r\ndefiant act of Madame Lalonde\xe2\x80\x99s existence. She persisted in it, to her\r\nown astonishment and the wonder of those who knew her and her mother.\r\n\r\nFor old Madame Carambeau was a woman of many prejudices\xe2\x80\x94so many, in\r\nfact, that it would be difficult to name them all. She detested dogs,\r\ncats, organ-grinders, white servants and children\xe2\x80\x99s noises. She despised\r\nAmericans, Germans and all people of a different faith from her own.\r\nAnything not French had, in her opinion, little right to existence.\r\n\r\nShe had not spoken to her son Henri for ten years because he had married\r\nan American girl from Prytania street. She would not permit green tea to\r\nbe introduced into her house, and those who could not or would not drink\r\ncoffee might drink tisane of _fleur de Laurier_ for all she cared.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the children seemed to be having it all their own way that\r\nday, and the organ-grinders were let loose. Old madame, in her retired\r\ncorner, could hear the screams, the laughter and the music far more\r\ndistinctly than she liked. She rocked herself noisily, and hummed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartant pour la Syrie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was straight and slender. Her hair was white, and she wore it in\r\npuffs on the temples. Her skin was fair and her eyes blue and cold.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she became aware that footsteps were approaching, and\r\nthreatening to invade her privacy\xe2\x80\x94not only footsteps, but screams! Then\r\ntwo little children, one in hot pursuit of the other, darted wildly\r\naround the corner near which she sat.\r\n\r\nThe child in advance, a pretty little girl, sprang excitedly into Madame\r\nCarambeau\xe2\x80\x99s lap, and threw her arms convulsively around the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck. Her companion lightly struck her a \xe2\x80\x9clast tag,\xe2\x80\x9d and ran laughing\r\ngleefully away.\r\n\r\nThe most natural thing for the child to do then would have been to\r\nwriggle down from madame\xe2\x80\x99s lap, without a \xe2\x80\x9cthank you\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cby your\r\nleave,\xe2\x80\x9d after the manner of small and thoughtless children. But she did\r\nnot do this. She stayed there, panting and fluttering, like a frightened\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nMadame was greatly annoyed. She moved as if to put the child away from\r\nher, and scolded her sharply for being boisterous and rude. The little\r\none, who did not understand French, was not disturbed by the reprimand,\r\nand stayed on in madame\xe2\x80\x99s lap. She rested her plump little cheek, that\r\nwas hot and flushed, against the soft white linen of the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngown.\r\n\r\nHer cheek was very hot and very flushed. It was dry, too, and so were\r\nher hands. The child\xe2\x80\x99s breathing was quick and irregular. Madame was not\r\nlong in detecting these signs of disturbance.\r\n\r\nThough she was a creature of prejudice, she was nevertheless a skillful\r\nand accomplished nurse, and a connoisseur in all matters pertaining to\r\nhealth. She prided herself upon this talent, and never lost an\r\nopportunity of exercising it. She would have treated an organ-grinder\r\nwith tender consideration if one had presented himself in the character\r\nof an invalid.\r\n\r\nMadame\xe2\x80\x99s manner toward the little one changed immediately. Her arms and\r\nher lap were at once adjusted so as to become the most comfortable of\r\nresting places. She rocked very gently to and fro. She fanned the child\r\nsoftly with her palm leaf fan, and sang \xe2\x80\x9cPartant pour la Syrie\xe2\x80\x9d in a low\r\nand agreeable tone.\r\n\r\nThe child was perfectly content to lie still and prattle a little in\r\nthat language which madame thought hideous. But the brown eyes were soon\r\nswimming in drowsiness, and the little body grew heavy with sleep in\r\nmadame\xe2\x80\x99s clasp.\r\n\r\nWhen the little girl slept Madame Carambeau arose, and treading\r\ncarefully and deliberately, entered her room, that opened near at hand\r\nupon the gallery. The room was large, airy and inviting, with its cool\r\nmatting upon the floor, and its heavy, old, polished mahogany furniture.\r\nMadame, with the child still in her arms, pulled a bell-cord; then she\r\nstood waiting, swaying gently back and forth. Presently an old black\r\nwoman answered the summons. She wore gold hoops in her ears, and a\r\nbright bandanna knotted fantastically on her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouise, turn down the bed,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded madame. \xe2\x80\x9cPlace that small, soft\r\npillow below the bolster. Here is a poor little unfortunate creature\r\nwhom Providence must have driven into my arms.\xe2\x80\x9d She laid the child\r\ncarefully down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, those Americans! Do they deserve to have children? Understanding as\r\nlittle as they do how to take care of them!\xe2\x80\x9d said madame, while Louise\r\nwas mumbling an accompanying assent that would have been unintelligible\r\nto any one unacquainted with the negro patois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see, Louise, she is burning up,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked madame; \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe is\r\nconsumed. Unfasten the little bodice while I lift her. Ah, talk to me of\r\nsuch parents! So stupid as not to perceive a fever like that coming on,\r\nbut they must dress their child up like a monkey to go play and dance to\r\nthe music of organ-grinders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you better sense, Louise, than to take off a child\xe2\x80\x99s shoe as if\r\nyou were removing the boot from the leg of a cavalry officer?\xe2\x80\x9d Madame\r\nwould have required fairy fingers to minister to the sick. \xe2\x80\x9cNow go to\r\nMamzelle C\xc3\xa9cile, and tell her to send me one of those old, soft, thin\r\nnightgowns that Gustave wore two summers ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the woman retired, madame busied herself with concocting a cooling\r\npitcher of orange-flower water, and mixing a fresh supply of _eau\r\ns\xc3\xa9dative_ with which agreeably to sponge the little invalid.\r\n\r\nMadame Lalonde came herself with the old, soft nightgown. She was a\r\npretty, blonde, plump little woman, with the deprecatory air of one\r\nwhose will has become flaccid from want of use. She was mildly\r\ndistressed at what her mother had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mamma! But, mamma, the child\xe2\x80\x99s parents will be sending the\r\ncarriage for her in a little while. Really, there was no use. Oh dear!\r\noh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the bedpost had spoken to Madame Carambeau, she would have paid more\r\nattention, for speech from such a source would have been at least\r\nsurprising if not convincing. Madame Lalonde did not possess the faculty\r\nof either surprising or convincing her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the little one will be quite comfortable in this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\nlady, taking the garment from her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s irresolute hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mamma! What shall I say, what shall I do when they send? Oh, dear;\r\noh, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is your business,\xe2\x80\x9d replied madame, with lofty indifference. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nconcern is solely with a sick child that happens to be under my roof. I\r\nthink I know my duty at this time of life, C\xc3\xa9cile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Madame Lalonde predicted, the carriage soon came, with a stiff\r\nEnglish coachman driving it, and a red-cheeked Irish nurse-maid seated\r\ninside. Madame would not even permit the maid to see her little charge.\r\nShe had an original theory that the Irish voice is distressing to the\r\nsick.\r\n\r\nMadame Lalonde sent the girl away with a long letter of explanation that\r\nmust have satisfied the parents; for the child was left undisturbed in\r\nMadame Carambeau\xe2\x80\x99s care. She was a sweet child, gentle and affectionate.\r\nAnd, though she cried and fretted a little throughout the night for her\r\nmother, she seemed, after all, to take kindly to madame\xe2\x80\x99s gentle\r\nnursing. It was not much of a fever that afflicted her, and after two\r\ndays she was well enough to be sent back to her parents.\r\n\r\nMadame, in all her varied experience with the sick, had never before\r\nnursed so objectionable a character as an American child. But the\r\ntrouble was that after the little one went away, she could think of\r\nnothing really objectionable against her except the accident of her\r\nbirth, which was, after all, her misfortune; and her ignorance of the\r\nFrench language, which was not her fault.\r\n\r\nBut the touch of the caressing baby arms; the pressure of the soft\r\nlittle body in the night; the tones of the voice, and the feeling of the\r\nhot lips when the child kissed her, believing herself to be with her\r\nmother, were impressions that had sunk through the crust of madame\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprejudice and reached her heart.\r\n\r\nShe often walked the length of the gallery, looking out across the wide,\r\nmajestic river. Sometimes she trod the mazes of her garden where the\r\nsolitude was almost that of a tropical jungle. It was during such\r\nmoments that the seed began to work in her soul\xe2\x80\x94the seed planted by the\r\ninnocent and undesigning hands of a little child.\r\n\r\nThe first shoot that it sent forth was Doubt. Madame plucked it away\r\nonce or twice. But it sprouted again, and with it Mistrust and\r\nDissatisfaction. Then from the heart of the seed, and amid the shoots of\r\nDoubt and Misgiving, came the flower of Truth. It was a very beautiful\r\nflower, and it bloomed on Christmas morning.\r\n\r\nAs Madame Carambeau and her daughter were about to enter her carriage on\r\nthat Christmas morning, to be driven to church, the old lady stopped to\r\ngive an order to her black coachman, Fran\xc3\xa7ois. Fran\xc3\xa7ois had been driving\r\nthese ladies every Sunday morning to the French Cathedral for so many\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94he had forgotten exactly how many, but ever since he had entered\r\ntheir service, when Madame Lalonde was a little girl. His astonishment\r\nmay therefore be imagined when Madame Carambeau said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFran\xc3\xa7ois, to-day you will drive us to one of the American churches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlait-il, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d the negro stammered, doubting the evidence of his\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you will drive us to one of the American churches. Any one of\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a sweep of her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they are all\r\nalike,\xe2\x80\x9d and she followed her daughter into the carriage.\r\n\r\nMadame Lalonde\xe2\x80\x99s surprise and agitation were painful to see, and they\r\ndeprived her of the ability to question, even if she had possessed the\r\ncourage to do so.\r\n\r\nFran\xc3\xa7ois, left to his fancy, drove them to St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Church on Camp\r\nstreet. Madame Lalonde looked and felt like the proverbial fish out of\r\nits element as they entered the edifice. Madame Carambeau, on the\r\ncontrary, looked as if she had been attending St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s church all\r\nher life. She sat with unruffled calm through the long service and\r\nthrough a lengthy English sermon, of which she did not understand a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nWhen the mass was ended and they were about to enter the carriage again,\r\nMadame Carambeau turned, as she had done before, to the coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFran\xc3\xa7ois,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will now drive us to the residence of\r\nmy son, M. Henri Carambeau. No doubt Mamzelle C\xc3\xa9cile can inform you\r\nwhere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a sharply penetrating glance that caused\r\nMadame Lalonde to wince.\r\n\r\nYes, her daughter C\xc3\xa9cile knew, and so did Fran\xc3\xa7ois, for that matter.\r\nThey drove out St. Charles avenue\xe2\x80\x94very far out. It was like a strange\r\ncity to old madame, who had not been in the American quarter since the\r\ntown had taken on this new and splendid growth.\r\n\r\nThe morning was a delicious one, soft and mild; and the roses were all\r\nin bloom. They were not hidden behind spiked fences. Madame appeared not\r\nto notice them, or the beautiful and striking residences that lined the\r\navenue along which they drove. She held a bottle of smelling-salts to\r\nher nostrils, as though she were passing through the most unsavory\r\ninstead of the most beautiful quarter of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nHenri\xe2\x80\x99s house was a very modern and very handsome one, standing a little\r\ndistance away from the street. A well-kept lawn, studded with rare and\r\ncharming plants, surrounded it. The ladies, dismounting, rang the bell,\r\nand stood out upon the banquette, waiting for the iron gate to be\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nA white maid-servant admitted them. Madame did not seem to mind. She\r\nhanded her a card with all proper ceremony, and followed with her\r\ndaughter to the house.\r\n\r\nNot once did she show a sign of weakness; not even when her son, Henri,\r\ncame and took her in his arms and sobbed and wept upon her neck as only\r\na warm-hearted Creole could. He was a big, good-looking, honest-faced\r\nman, with tender brown eyes like his dead father\xe2\x80\x99s and a firm mouth like\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nYoung Mrs. Carambeau came, too, her sweet, fresh face transfigured with\r\nhappiness. She led by the hand her little daughter, the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican child\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhom madame had nursed so tenderly a month before, never suspecting the\r\nlittle one to be other than an alien to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lucky chance was that fever! What a happy accident!\xe2\x80\x9d gurgled\r\nMadame Lalonde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xc3\xa9cile, it was no accident, I tell you; it was Providence,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke\r\nmadame, reprovingly, and no one contradicted her.\r\n\r\nThey all drove back together to eat Christmas dinner in the old house by\r\nthe river. Madame held her little granddaughter upon her lap; her son\r\nHenri sat facing her, and beside her was her daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nHenri sat back in the carriage and could not speak. His soul was\r\npossessed by a pathetic joy that would not admit of speech. He was going\r\nback again to the home where he was born, after a banishment of ten long\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHe would hear again the water beat against the green levee-bank with a\r\nsound that was not quite like any other that he could remember. He would\r\nsit within the sweet and solemn shadow of the deep and overhanging roof;\r\nand roam through the wild, rich solitude of the old garden, where he had\r\nplayed his pranks of boyhood and dreamed his dreams of youth. He would\r\nlisten to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling him, \xe2\x80\x9cmon fils,\xe2\x80\x9d as it had always\r\ndone before that day he had to choose between mother and wife. No; he\r\ncould not speak.\r\n\r\nBut his wife chatted much and pleasantly\xe2\x80\x94in a French, however, that must\r\nhave been trying to old madame to listen to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so sorry, ma m\xc3\xa8re,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our little one does not speak\r\nFrench. It is not my fault, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d and she flushed and hesitated\r\na little. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x94it was Henri who would not permit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied madame, amiably, drawing the child close to\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cHer grandmother will teach her French; and she will teach her\r\ngrandmother English. You see, I have no prejudices. I am not like my\r\nson. Henri was always a stubborn boy. Heaven only knows how he came by\r\nsuch a character!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                 Caline\r\n\r\n                                 Caline\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was just far enough in the west to send inviting shadows. In the\r\ncentre of a small field, and in the shade of a haystack which was there,\r\na girl lay sleeping. She had slept long and soundly, when something\r\nawoke her as suddenly as if it had been a blow. She opened her eyes and\r\nstared a moment up in the cloudless sky. She yawned and stretched her\r\nlong brown legs and arms, lazily. Then she arose, never minding the bits\r\nof straw that clung to her black hair, to her red bodice, and the blue\r\ncotonade skirt that did not reach her naked ankles.\r\n\r\nThe log cabin in which she dwelt with her parents was just outside the\r\nenclosure in which she had been sleeping. Beyond was a small clearing\r\nthat did duty as a cotton field. All else was dense wood, except the\r\nlong stretch that curved round the brow of the hill, and in which\r\nglittered the steel rails of the Texas and Pacific road.\r\n\r\nWhen Caline emerged from the shadow she saw a long train of passenger\r\ncoaches standing in view, where they must have stopped abruptly. It was\r\nthat sudden stopping which had awakened her; for such a thing had not\r\nhappened before within her recollection, and she looked stupid, at\r\nfirst, with astonishment. There seemed to be something wrong with the\r\nengine; and some of the passengers who dismounted went forward to\r\ninvestigate the trouble. Others came strolling along in the direction of\r\nthe cabin, where Caline stood under an old gnarled mulberry tree,\r\nstaring. Her father had halted his mule at the end of the cotton row,\r\nand stood staring also, leaning upon his plow.\r\n\r\nThere were ladies in the party. They walked awkwardly in their\r\nhigh-heeled boots over the rough, uneven ground, and held up their\r\nskirts mincingly. They twirled parasols over their shoulders, and\r\nlaughed immoderately at the funny things which their masculine\r\ncompanions were saying.\r\n\r\nThey tried to talk to Caline, but could not understand the French patois\r\nwith which she answered them.\r\n\r\nOne of the men\xe2\x80\x94a pleasant-faced youngster\xe2\x80\x94drew a sketch book from his\r\npocket and began to make a picture of the girl. She stayed motionless,\r\nher hands behind her, and her wide eyes fixed earnestly upon him.\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished there was a summons from the train; and all went\r\nscampering hurriedly away. The engine screeched, it sent a few lazy\r\npuffs into the still air, and in another moment or two had vanished,\r\nbearing its human cargo with it.\r\n\r\nCaline could not feel the same after that. She looked with new and\r\nstrange interest upon the trains of cars that passed so swiftly back and\r\nforth across her vision, each day; and wondered whence these people\r\ncame, and whither they were going.\r\n\r\nHer mother and father could not tell her, except to say that they came\r\nfrom \xe2\x80\x9cloin l\xc3\xa0 bas,\xe2\x80\x9d and were going \xe2\x80\x9cDjieu sait \xc3\xa9 o\xc3\xb9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne day she walked miles down the track to talk with the old flagman,\r\nwho stayed down there by the big water tank. Yes, he knew. Those people\r\ncame from the great cities in the north, and were going to the city in\r\nthe south. He knew all about the city; it was a grand place. He had\r\nlived there once. His sister lived there now; and she would be glad\r\nenough to have so fine a girl as Caline to help her cook and scrub, and\r\ntend the babies. And he thought Caline might earn as much as five\r\ndollars a month, in the city.\r\n\r\nSo she went; in a new cotonade, and her Sunday shoes; with a sacredly\r\nguarded scrawl that the flagman sent to his sister.\r\n\r\nThe woman lived in a tiny, stuccoed house, with green blinds, and three\r\nwooden steps leading down to the banquette. There seemed to be hundreds\r\nlike it along the street. Over the house tops loomed the tall masts of\r\nships, and the hum of the French market could be heard on a still\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nCaline was at first bewildered. She had to readjust all her\r\npreconceptions to fit the reality of it. The flagman\xe2\x80\x99s sister was a kind\r\nand gentle task-mistress. At the end of a week or two she wanted to know\r\nhow the girl liked it all. Caline liked it very well, for it was\r\npleasant, on Sunday afternoons, to stroll with the children under the\r\ngreat, solemn sugar sheds; or to sit upon the compressed cotton bales,\r\nwatching the stately steamers, the graceful boats, and noisy little tugs\r\nthat plied the waters of the Mississippi. And it filled her with\r\nagreeable excitement to go to the French market, where the handsome\r\nGascon butchers were eager to present their compliments and little\r\nSunday bouquets to the pretty Acadian girl; and to throw fistfuls of\r\n_lagniappe_ into her basket.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman asked her again after another week if she were still\r\npleased, she was not so sure. And again when she questioned Caline the\r\ngirl turned away, and went to sit behind the big, yellow cistern, to cry\r\nunobserved. For she knew now that it was not the great city and its\r\ncrowds of people she had so eagerly sought; but the pleasant-faced boy,\r\nwho had made her picture that day under the mulberry tree.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                        A Dresden Lady in Dixie\r\n\r\n                        A Dresden Lady in Dixie\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Valtour had been in the sitting-room some time before she noticed\r\nthe absence of the Dresden china figure from the corner of the\r\nmantel-piece, where it had stood for years. Aside from the intrinsic\r\nvalue of the piece, there were some very sad and tender memories\r\nassociated with it. A baby\xe2\x80\x99s lips that were now forever still had loved\r\nonce to kiss the painted \xe2\x80\x9cpitty \xe2\x80\x99ady\xe2\x80\x9d; and the baby arms had often held\r\nit in a close and smothered embrace.\r\n\r\nMadame Valtour gave a rapid, startled glance around the room, to see\r\nperchance if it had been misplaced; but she failed to discover it.\r\n\r\nViny, the house-maid, when summoned, remembered having carefully dusted\r\nit that morning, and was rather indignantly positive that she had not\r\nbroken the thing to bits and secreted the pieces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has been in the room during my absence?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Madame Valtour,\r\nwith asperity. Viny abandoned herself to a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPa-Jeff comed in yere wid de mail\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d If she had said St. Peter came in\r\nwith the mail, the fact would have had as little bearing on the case\r\nfrom Madame Valtour\xe2\x80\x99s point of view.\r\n\r\nPa-Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s uprightness and honesty were so long and firmly established as\r\nto have become proverbial on the plantation. He had not served the\r\nfamily faithfully since boyhood and been all through the war with \xe2\x80\x9cold\r\nMarse Valtour\xe2\x80\x9d to descend at his time of life to tampering with\r\nhousehold bric-a-brac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas any one else been here?\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Valtour naturally inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn\xe2\x80\x99y Agapie w\xe2\x80\x99at brung you some Creole aiggs. I tole \xe2\x80\x99er to sot \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ndown in de hall. I don\xe2\x80\x99 know she comed in de settin\xe2\x80\x99-room o\xe2\x80\x99 not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, there they were; eight, fresh \xe2\x80\x9cCreole eggs\xe2\x80\x9d reposing on the muslin\r\nin the sewing basket. Viny herself had been seated on the gallery\r\nbrushing her mistress\xe2\x80\x99 gowns during the hours of that lady\xe2\x80\x99s absence,\r\nand could think of no one else having penetrated to the sitting-room.\r\n\r\nMadame Valtour did not entertain the thought that Agapie had stolen the\r\nrelic. Her worst fear was, that the girl, finding herself alone in the\r\nroom, had handled the frail bit of porcelain and inadvertently broken\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAgapie came often to the house to play with the children and amuse\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94she loved nothing better. Indeed, no other spot known to her on\r\nearth so closely embodied her confused idea of paradise, as this home\r\nwith its atmosphere of love, comfort and good cheer. She was, herself, a\r\ncheery bit of humanity, overflowing with kind impulses and animal\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nMadame Valtour recalled the fact that Agapie had often admired this\r\nDresden figure (but what had she not admired!); and she remembered\r\nhaving heard the girl\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that if ever she became possessed of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfo\xe2\x80\x99 bits\xe2\x80\x9d to spend as she liked, she would have some one buy her just\r\nsuch a china doll in town or in the city.\r\n\r\nBefore night, the fact that the Dresden lady had strayed from her proud\r\neminence on the sitting-room mantel, became, through Viny\xe2\x80\x99s indiscreet\r\nbabbling, pretty well known on the place.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Madame Valtour crossed the field and went over to\r\nthe Bedauts\xe2\x80\x99 cabin. The cabins on the plantation were not grouped; but\r\neach stood isolated upon the section of land which its occupants\r\ncultivated. Pa-Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s cabin was the only one near enough to the Bedauts\r\nto admit of neighborly intercourse.\r\n\r\nSeraphine Bedaut was sitting on her small gallery, stringing red\r\npeppers, when Madame Valtour approached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so distressed, Madame Bedaut,\xe2\x80\x9d began the planter\xe2\x80\x99s wife, abruptly.\r\nBut the \xe2\x80\x99Cadian woman arose politely and interrupted, offering her\r\nvisitor a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, set down, Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Valtour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; it\xe2\x80\x99s only for a moment. You know, Madame Bedaut, yesterday when\r\nI returned from making a visit, I found that an ornament was missing\r\nfrom my sitting-room mantel-piece. It\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I prize very, very\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d with sudden tears filling her eyes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I would not willingly\r\npart with it for many times its value.\xe2\x80\x9d Seraphine Bedaut was listening,\r\nwith her mouth partly open, looking, in truth, stupidly puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one entered the room during my absence,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Madame Valtour,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut Agapie.\xe2\x80\x9d Seraphine\xe2\x80\x99s mouth snapped like a steel trap and her black\r\neyes gleamed with a flash of anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wan\xe2\x80\x99 say Agapie stole some\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99 in yo\xe2\x80\x99 house!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out in a\r\nshrill voice, tremulous from passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; oh no! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Agapie is an honest girl and we all love her; but\r\nyou know how children are. It was a small Dresden figure. She may have\r\nhandled and broken the thing and perhaps is afraid to say so. She may\r\nhave thoughtlessly misplaced it; oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what! I want to ask if\r\nshe saw it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in; you got to come in, Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Valtour,\xe2\x80\x9d stubbornly insisted\r\nSeraphine, leading the way into the cabin. \xe2\x80\x9cI sen\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99er to de house\r\nyistiddy wid some Creole aiggs,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on in her rasping voice, \xe2\x80\x9clike\r\nI all time do, because you all say you can\xe2\x80\x99t eat dem sto\xe2\x80\x99 aiggs no mo\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nYere de basket w\xe2\x80\x99at I sen\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em in,\xe2\x80\x9d reaching for an Indian basket which\r\nhung against the wall\xe2\x80\x94and which was partly filled with cotton seed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Madame Valtour, now thoroughly distressed\r\nat witnessing the woman\xe2\x80\x99s agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, bien non. I got to show you, Agapie en\xe2\x80\x99t no mo\xe2\x80\x99 thief \xe2\x80\x99an yo\xe2\x80\x99 own\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99en is.\xe2\x80\x9d She led the way into the adjoining room of the hut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYere all her things w\xe2\x80\x99at she \xe2\x80\x99muse herse\xe2\x80\x99f wid,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Seraphine,\r\npointing to a soapbox which stood on the floor just beneath the open\r\nwindow. The box was filled with an indescribable assortment of odds and\r\nends, mostly doll-rags. A catechism and a blue-*backed speller poked\r\ndog-eared corners from out of the confusion; for the Valtour children\r\nwere making heroic and patient efforts toward Agapie\xe2\x80\x99s training.\r\n\r\nSeraphine cast herself upon her knees before the box and dived her thin\r\nbrown hands among its contents. \xe2\x80\x9cI wan\xe2\x80\x99 show you; I goin\xe2\x80\x99 show you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nkept repeating excitedly. Madame Valtour was standing beside her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the woman drew forth from among the rags, the Dresden lady, as\r\ndapper, sound, and smiling as ever. Seraphine\xe2\x80\x99s hand shook so violently\r\nthat she was in danger of letting the image fall to the floor. Madame\r\nValtour reached out and took it very quietly from her. Then Seraphine\r\nrose tremblingly to her feet and broke into a sob that was pitiful to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nAgapie was approaching the cabin. She was a chubby girl of twelve. She\r\nwalked with bare, callous feet over the rough ground and bare-headed\r\nunder the hot sun. Her thick, short, black hair covered her head like a\r\nmane. She had been dancing along the path, but slackened her pace upon\r\ncatching sight of the two women who had returned to the gallery. But\r\nwhen she perceived that her mother was crying she darted impetuously\r\nforward. In an instant she had her arms around her mother\xe2\x80\x99s neck,\r\nclinging so tenaciously in her youthful strength as to make the frail\r\nwoman totter.\r\n\r\nAgapie had seen the Dresden figure in Madame Valtour\xe2\x80\x99s possession and at\r\nonce guessed the whole accusation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt en\xe2\x80\x99t so! I tell you, maman, it en\xe2\x80\x99t so! I neva touch\xe2\x80\x99 it. Stop\r\ncryin\xe2\x80\x99; stop cryin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d and she began to cry most piteously herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Agapie, we fine it in yo\xe2\x80\x99 box,\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Seraphine through her sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen somebody put it there. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see somebody put it there? \xe2\x80\x99Ten\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nso, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scene was extremely painful to Madame Valtour. Whatever she might\r\ntell these two later, for the time she felt herself powerless to say\r\nanything befitting, and she walked away. But she turned to remark, with\r\na hardness of expression and intention which she seldom displayed: \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\none will know of this through me. But, Agapie, you must not come into my\r\nhouse again; on account of the children; I could not allow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she walked away she could hear Agapie comforting her mother with\r\nrenewed protestations of innocence.\r\n\r\nPa-Jeff began to fail visibly that year. No wonder, considering his\r\ngreat age, which he computed to be about one hundred. It was, in fact,\r\nsome ten years less than that, but a good old age all the same. It was\r\nseldom that he got out into the field; and then, never to do any heavy\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94only a little light hoeing. There were days when the \xe2\x80\x9cmisery\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndoubled him up and nailed him down to his chair so that he could not set\r\nfoot beyond the door of his cabin. He would sit there courting the\r\nsunshine and blinking, as he gazed across the fields with the patience\r\nof the savage.\r\n\r\nThe Bedauts seemed to know almost instinctively when Pa-Jeff was sick.\r\nAgapie would shade her eyes and look searchingly towards the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99 see Pa-Jeff this mo\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPa-Jeff en\xe2\x80\x99t open his winda,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99 see no smoke yet yonda to Pa-Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d And in a little while the\r\ngirl would be over there with a pail of soup or coffee, or whatever\r\nthere was at hand which she thought the old negro might fancy. She had\r\nlost all the color out of her cheeks and was pining like a sick bird.\r\n\r\nShe often sat on the steps of the gallery and talked with the old man\r\nwhile she waited for him to finish his soup from her tin pail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Pa-Jeff, its neva been no thief in the Bedaut family. My pa\r\nsay he couldn\xe2\x80\x99 hole up his head if he think I been a thief, me. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmaman say it would make her sick in bed, she don\xe2\x80\x99 know she could ever\r\ngit up. Sosth\xc3\xa8ne tell me the chil\xe2\x80\x99en been cryin\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99 me up yonda. Li\xe2\x80\x99le\r\nLulu cry so hard M\xe2\x80\x99sieur Valtour want sen\xe2\x80\x99 afta me, an\xe2\x80\x99 Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Valtour\r\nsay no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this, Agapie flung herself at length upon the gallery with her\r\nface buried in her arms, and began to cry so hysterically as seriously\r\nto alarm Pa-Jeff. It was well he had finished his soup, for he could not\r\nhave eaten another mouthful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHole up yo\xe2\x80\x99 head, chile. God save us! W\xe2\x80\x99at you kiarrin\xe2\x80\x99 on dat away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe exclaimed in great distress. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gwine to take a fit? Hole up yo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgapie rose slowly to her feet, and drying her eyes upon the sleeve of\r\nher \xe2\x80\x9cjosie,\xe2\x80\x9d reached out for the tin bucket. Pa-Jeff handed it to her,\r\nbut without relinquishing his hold upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWar hit you w\xe2\x80\x99at tuck it?\xe2\x80\x9d he questioned in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI isn\xe2\x80\x99 gwine\r\ntell; you knows I isn\xe2\x80\x99 gwine tell.\xe2\x80\x9d She only shook her head, attempting\r\nto draw the pail forcibly away from the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe\xe2\x80\x99 me go, Pa-Jeff. W\xe2\x80\x99at you doin\xe2\x80\x99! Gi\xe2\x80\x99 me my bucket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kept his old blinking eyes fastened for a while questioningly upon\r\nher disturbed and tear-stained face. Then he let her go and she turned\r\nand ran swiftly away towards her home.\r\n\r\nHe sat very still watching her disappear; only his furrowed old face\r\ntwitched convulsively, moved by an unaccustomed train of reasoning that\r\nwas at work in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe w\xe2\x80\x99ite, I is black,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered calculatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe young, I is\r\nole; sho I is ole. She good to Pa-Jeff like I her own kin an\xe2\x80\x99 color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThis line of thought seemed to possess him to the exclusion of every\r\nother. Late in the night he was still muttering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSho I is ole. She good to Pa-Jeff, yas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few days later, when Pa-Jeff happened to be feeling comparatively\r\nwell, he presented himself at the house just as the family had assembled\r\nat their early dinner. Looking up suddenly, Monsieur Valtour was\r\nastonished to see him standing there in the room near the open door. He\r\nleaned upon his cane and his grizzled head was bowed upon his breast.\r\nThere was general satisfaction expressed at seeing Pa-Jeff on his legs\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, old man, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you out again,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the planter,\r\ncordially, pouring a glass of wine, which he instructed Viny to hand to\r\nthe old fellow. Pa-Jeff accepted the glass and set it solemnly down upon\r\na small table near by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarse Albert,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI is come heah to-day fo\xe2\x80\x99 to make a statement\r\nof de rights an\xe2\x80\x99 de wrongs w\xe2\x80\x99at is done hang heavy on my soul dis heah\r\nlong time. Arter you heahs me an\xe2\x80\x99 de missus heahs me an\xe2\x80\x99 de chillun an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nev\xe2\x80\x99-body, den ef you says: \xe2\x80\x98Pa-Jeff you kin tech yo\xe2\x80\x99 lips to dat glass\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 wine,\xe2\x80\x99 all well an\xe2\x80\x99 right.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis manner was impressive and caused the family to exchange surprised\r\nand troubled glances. Foreseeing that his recital might be long, a chair\r\nwas offered to him, but he declined it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cw\xe2\x80\x99en I ben hoein\xe2\x80\x99 de madam\xe2\x80\x99s flower bed close to\r\nde fence, Sosth\xc3\xa9ne he ride up, he say: \xe2\x80\x98Heah, Pa-Jeff, heah de mail.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ntakes de mail f\xe2\x80\x99on \xe2\x80\x99im an\xe2\x80\x99 I calls out to Viny w\xe2\x80\x99at settin\xe2\x80\x99 on de\r\ngallery: \xe2\x80\x98Heah Marse Albert\xe2\x80\x99s mail, gal; come git it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Viny she answer, pert-like\xe2\x80\x94des like Viny: \xe2\x80\x98You is got two laigs,\r\nPa-Jeff, des well as me.\xe2\x80\x99 I ain\xe2\x80\x99t no ban\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99 disputin\xe2\x80\x99 wid gals, so I\r\nbrace up an\xe2\x80\x99 I come \xe2\x80\x99long to de house an\xe2\x80\x99 goes on in dat settin\xe2\x80\x99-room\r\ndah, naix\xe2\x80\x99 to de dinin\xe2\x80\x99-room.

His hearers\r\nwere moved with distressful astonishment. They would have had him stop\r\nthe recital right there, but Pa-Jeff resumed, with an effort:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome dat night I heah tell how dat li\xe2\x80\x99le trick, we\xe2\x80\x99th heap money; how\r\nmadam, she cryin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99cause her li\xe2\x80\x99le blessed lamb was use\xe2\x80\x99 to play wid\r\ndat, an\xe2\x80\x99 kiar-on ov\xe2\x80\x99 it.

Dey twis\xe2\x80\x99es an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntwines me. Dey dashes me down an\xe2\x80\x99 jerks me up. But de Sperrit he win dat\r\nfight in de en\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 heah I is, mist\xe2\x80\x99ess, master, chillun\xe2\x80\x99; heah I is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYears later Pa-Jeff was still telling the story of his temptation and\r\nfall. The negroes especially seemed never to tire of hearing him relate\r\nit. He enlarged greatly upon the theme as he went, adding new and\r\ndramatic features which gave fresh interest to its every telling.\r\n\r\nAgapie grew up to deserve the confidence and favors of the family. She\r\nredoubled her acts of kindness toward Pa-Jeff; but somehow she could not\r\nlook into his face again.\r\n\r\nYet she need not have feared. Long before the end came, poor old\r\nPa-Jeff, confused, bewildered, believed the story himself as firmly as\r\nthose who had heard him tell it over and over for so many years.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               N\xc3\xa9g Cr\xc3\xa9ol\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               N\xc3\xa9g Cr\xc3\xa9ol\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the remote period of his birth he had been named C\xc3\xa9sar Fran\xc3\xa7ois\r\nXavier, but no one ever thought of calling him anything but Chicot, or\r\nN\xc3\xa9g, or Maringouin. Down at the French market, where he worked among the\r\nfishmongers, they called him Chicot, when they were not calling him\r\nnames that are written less freely than they are spoken. But one felt\r\nprivileged to call him almost anything, he was so black, lean, lame, and\r\nshriveled. He wore a head-kerchief, and whatever other rags the\r\nfishermen and their wives chose to bestow upon him. Throughout one whole\r\nwinter he wore a woman\xe2\x80\x99s discarded jacket with puffed sleeves.\r\n\r\nAmong some startling beliefs entertained by Chicot was one that \xe2\x80\x9cMichi\xc3\xa9\r\nSt. Pierre et Michi\xc3\xa9 St. Paul\xe2\x80\x9d had created him. Of \xe2\x80\x9cMichi\xc3\xa9 bon Dieu\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nheld his own private opinion, and not a too flattering one at that. This\r\nfantastic notion concerning the origin of his being he owed to the early\r\nteaching of his young master, a lax believer, and a great _farceur_ in\r\nhis day. Chicot had once been thrashed by a robust young Irish priest\r\nfor expressing his religious views, and at another time knifed by a\r\nSicilian. So he had come to hold his peace upon that subject.\r\n\r\nUpon another theme he talked freely and harped continuously. For years\r\nhe had tried to convince his associates that his master had left a\r\nprogeny, rich, cultured, powerful, and numerous beyond belief. This\r\nprosperous race of beings inhabited the most imposing mansions in the\r\ncity of New Orleans. Men of note and position, whose names were familiar\r\nto the public, he swore were grandchildren, great-grandchildren, or,\r\nless frequently, distant relatives of his master, long deceased, Ladies\r\nwho came to the market in carriages, or whose elegance of attire\r\nattracted the attention and admiration of the fishwomen, were all _des\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tites cousines_ to his former master, Jean Boisdur\xc3\xa9. He never looked\r\nfor recognition from any of these superior beings, but delighted to\r\ndiscourse by the hour upon their dignity and pride of birth and wealth.\r\n\r\nChicot always carried an old gunny-sack, and into this went his\r\nearnings. He cleaned stalls at the market, scaled fish, and did many odd\r\noffices for the itinerant merchants, who usually paid in trade for his\r\nservice. Occasionally he saw the color of silver and got his clutch upon\r\na coin, but he accepted anything, and seldom made terms. He was glad to\r\nget a handkerchief from the Hebrew, and grateful if the Choctaws would\r\ntrade him a bottle of _fil\xc3\xa9_ it. The butcher flung him a soup bone, and\r\nthe fishmonger a few crabs or a paper bag of shrimps. It was the big\r\n_mulatresse_, _vendeuse de caf\xc3\xa9_, who cared for his inner man.\r\n\r\nOnce Chicot was accused by a shoe-vender of attempting to steal a pair\r\nof ladies\xe2\x80\x99 shoes. He declared he was only examining them. The clamor\r\nraised in the market was terrific. Young Dagoes assembled and squealed\r\nlike rats; a couple of Gascon butchers bellowed like bulls. Matteo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife shook her fist in the accuser\xe2\x80\x99s face and called him\r\nincomprehensible names. The Choctaw women, where they squatted, turned\r\ntheir slow eyes in the direction of the fray, taking no further notice;\r\nwhile a policeman jerked Chicot around by the puffed sleeve and\r\nbrandished a club. It was a narrow escape.\r\n\r\nNobody knew where Chicot lived. A man\xe2\x80\x94even a n\xc3\xa9g cr\xc3\xa9ol\xe2\x80\x94who lives among\r\nthe reeds and willows of Bayou St. John, in a deserted chicken-coop\r\nconstructed chiefly of tarred paper, is not going to boast of his\r\nhabitation or to invite attention to his domestic appointments. When,\r\nafter market hours, he vanished in the direction of St. Philip street,\r\nlimping, seemingly bent under the weight of his gunny-bag, it was like\r\nthe disappearance from the stage of some petty actor whom the audience\r\ndoes not follow in imagination beyond the wings, or think of till his\r\nreturn in another scene.\r\n\r\nThere was one to whom Chicot\xe2\x80\x99s coming or going meant more than this. In\r\n_la maison grise_ they called her La Chouette, for no earthly reason\r\nunless that she perched high under the roof of the old rookery and\r\nscolded in shrill sudden outbursts. Forty or fifty years before, when\r\nfor a little while she acted minor parts with a company of French\r\nplayers (an escapade that had brought her grandmother to the grave), she\r\nwas known as Mademoiselle de Montallaine. Seventy-five years before she\r\nhad been christened Agla\xc3\xa9 Boisdur\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nNo matter at what hour the old negro appeared at her threshold, Mamzelle\r\nAgla\xc3\xa9 always kept him waiting till she finished her prayers. She opened\r\nthe door for him and silently motioned him to a seat, returning to\r\nprostrate herself upon her knees before a crucifix, and a shell filled\r\nwith holy water that stood on a small table; it represented in her\r\nimagination an altar. Chicot knew that she did it to aggravate him; he\r\nwas convinced that she timed her devotions to begin when she heard his\r\nfootsteps on the stairs. He would sit with sullen eyes contemplating her\r\nlong, spare, poorly clad figure as she knelt and read from her book or\r\nfinished her prayers. Bitter was the religious warfare that had raged\r\nfor years between them, and Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 had grown, on her side, as\r\nintolerant as Chicot. She had come to hold St. Peter and St. Paul in\r\nsuch utter detestation that she had cut their pictures out of her\r\nprayer-book.\r\n\r\nThen Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 pretended not to care what Chicot had in his bag. He\r\ndrew forth a small hunk of beef and laid it in her basket that stood on\r\nthe bare floor. She looked from the corner of her eye, and went on\r\ndusting the table. He brought out a handful of potatoes, some pieces of\r\nsliced fish, a few herbs, a yard of calico, and a small pat of butter\r\nwrapped in lettuce leaves. He was proud of the butter, and wanted her to\r\nnotice it. He held it out and asked her for something to put it on. She\r\nhanded him a saucer, and looked indifferent and resigned, with lifted\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPas d\xe2\x80\x99 sucre, N\xc3\xa9g?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChicot shook his head and scratched it, and looked like a black picture\r\nof distress and mortification. No sugar! But tomorrow he would get a\r\npinch here and a pinch there, and would bring as much as a cupful.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 then sat down, and talked to Chicot uninterruptedly and\r\nconfidentially. She complained bitterly, and it was all about a pain\r\nthat lodged in her leg; that crept and acted like a live, stinging\r\nserpent, twining about her waist and up her spine, and coiling round the\r\nshoulder-blade. And then _les rheumatismes_ in her fingers! He could see\r\nfor himself how they were knotted. She could not bend them; she could\r\nhold nothing in her hands, and had let a saucer fall that morning and\r\nbroken it in pieces. And if she were to tell him that she had slept a\r\nwink through the night, she would be a liar, deserving of perdition. She\r\nhad sat at the window _la nuit blanche_, hearing the hours strike and\r\nthe market-wagons rumble. Chicot nodded, and kept up a running fire of\r\nsympathetic comment and suggestive remedies for rheumatism and insomnia:\r\nherbs, or _tisanes_, or _grigris_, or all three. As if he knew! There\r\nwas Purgatory Mary, a perambulating soul whose office in life was to\r\npray for the shades in purgatory,\xe2\x80\x94she had brought Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 a\r\nbottle of _eau de Lourdes_, but so little of it! She might have kept her\r\nwater of Lourdes, for all the good it did,\xe2\x80\x94a drop! Not so much as would\r\ncure a fly or a mosquito! Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 was going to show Purgatory\r\nMary the door when she came again, not only because of her avarice with\r\nthe Lourdes water, but, beside that, she brought in on her feet dirt\r\nthat could only be removed with a shovel after she left.\r\n\r\nAnd Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 wanted to inform Chicot that there would be slaughter\r\nand bloodshed in _la maison grise_ if the people below stairs did not\r\nmend their ways. She was convinced that they lived for no other purpose\r\nthan to torture and molest her. The woman kept a bucket of dirty water\r\nconstantly on the landing with the hope of Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 falling over\r\nit or into it. And she knew that the children were instructed to gather\r\nin the hall and on the stairway, and scream and make a noise and jump up\r\nand down like galloping horses, with the intention of driving her to\r\nsuicide. Chicot should notify the policeman on the beat, and have them\r\narrested, if possible, and thrust into the parish prison, where they\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nChicot would have been extremely alarmed if he had ever chanced to find\r\nMamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 in an uncomplaining mood. It never occurred to him that\r\nshe might be otherwise. He felt that she had a right to quarrel with\r\nfate, if ever mortal had. Her poverty was a disgrace, and he hung his\r\nhead before it and felt ashamed.\r\n\r\nOne day he found Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 stretched on the bed, with her head tied\r\nup in a handkerchief. Her sole complaint that day was, \xe2\x80\x9cA\xc3\xafe\xe2\x80\x94a\xc3\xafe\xe2\x80\x94a\xc3\xafe!\r\nA\xc3\xafe\xe2\x80\x94a\xc3\xafe\xe2\x80\x94a\xc3\xafe!\xe2\x80\x9d uttered with every breath. He had seen her so before,\r\nespecially when the weather was damp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVous pas b\xc3\xa9zouin tisane, Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9? Vous pas veux mo cri gagni\r\ndocteur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe desired nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cA\xc3\xafe\xe2\x80\x94a\xc3\xafe\xe2\x80\x94a\xc3\xafe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe emptied his bag very quietly, so as not to disturb her; and he wanted\r\nto stay there with her and lie down on the floor in case she needed him,\r\nbut the woman from below had come up. She was an Irishwoman with rolled\r\nsleeves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shtout shtick I\xe2\x80\x99m afther giving her, N\xc3\xa9g, and she do but knock\r\non the flure it\xe2\x80\x99s me or Janie or wan of us that\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou too good, Brigitte.

A\xc3\xafe\xe2\x80\x94a\xc3\xafe\xe2\x80\x94a\xc3\xafe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9g could hear her lamentation as he descended the stairs. It followed\r\nhim as he limped his way through the city streets, and seemed part of\r\nthe city\xe2\x80\x99s noise; he could hear it in the rumble of wheels and jangle of\r\ncar-*bells, and in the voices of those passing by.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at Mimotte the Voudou\xe2\x80\x99s shanty and bought a _grigri_\xe2\x80\x94a cheap\r\none for fifteen cents. Mimotte held her charms at all prices. This he\r\nintended to introduce next day into Mamzelle Angla\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s room,\xe2\x80\x94somewhere\r\nabout the altar,\xe2\x80\x94to the confusion and discomfort of \xe2\x80\x9cMichi\xc3\xa9 bon Dieu,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwho persistently declined to concern himself with the welfare of a\r\nBoisdur\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nAt night, among the reeds on the bayou, Chicot could still hear the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s wail, mingled now with the croaking of the frogs. If he could\r\nhave been convinced that giving up his life down there in the water\r\nwould in any way have bettered her condition, he would not have\r\nhesitated to sacrifice the remnant of his existence that was wholly\r\ndevoted to her. He lived but to serve her. He did not know it himself;\r\nbut Chicot knew so little, and that little in such a distorted way! He\r\ncould scarcely have been expected, even in his most lucid moments, to\r\ngive himself over to self-analysis.\r\n\r\nChicot gathered an uncommon amount of dainties at market the following\r\nday. He had to work hard, and scheme and whine a little; but he got hold\r\nof an orange and a lump of ice and a _chou-fleur_. He did not drink his\r\ncup of _caf\xc3\xa9 au lait_, but asked Mimi Lambeau to put it in the little\r\nnew tin pail that the Hebrew notion-vender had just given him in\r\nexchange for a mess of shrimps. This time, however, Chicot had his\r\ntrouble for nothing. When he reached the upper room of _la maison\r\ngrise_, it was to find that Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 had died during the night. He\r\nset his bag down in the middle of the floor, and stood shaking, and\r\nwhined low like a dog in pain.\r\n\r\nEverything had been done. The Irishwoman had gone for the doctor, and\r\nPurgatory Mary had summoned a priest. Furthermore, the woman had\r\narranged Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9 decently. She had covered the table with a white\r\ncloth, and had placed it at the head of the bed, with the crucifix and\r\ntwo lighted candles in silver candlesticks upon it; the little bit of\r\nornamentation brightened and embellished the poor room. Purgatory Mary,\r\ndressed in shabby black, fat and breathing hard, sat reading half\r\naudibly from a prayer-book. She was watching the dead and the silver\r\ncandlesticks, which she had borrowed from a benevolent society, and for\r\nwhich she held herself responsible. A young man was just leaving,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nreporter snuffing the air for items, who had scented one up there in the\r\ntop room of _la maison grise_.\r\n\r\nAll the morning Janie had been escorting a procession of street Arabs up\r\nand down the stairs to view the remains. One of them\xe2\x80\x94a little girl, who\r\nhad had her face washed and had made a species of toilet for the\r\noccasion\xe2\x80\x94refused to be dragged away. She stayed seated as if at an\r\nentertainment, fascinated alternately by the long, still figure of\r\nMamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9, the mumbling lips of Purgatory Mary, and the silver\r\ncandlesticks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill ye get down on yer knees, man, and say a prayer for the dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncommanded the woman.\r\n\r\nBut Chicot only shook his head, and refused to obey. He approached the\r\nbed, and laid a little black paw for a moment on the stiffened body of\r\nMamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9. There was nothing for him to do here. He picked up his\r\nold ragged hat and his bag and went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe black h\xe2\x80\x99athen!\xe2\x80\x9d the woman muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cShut the dure, child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little girl slid down from her chair, and went on tiptoe to shut the\r\ndoor which Chicot had left open. Having resumed her seat, she fastened\r\nher eyes upon Purgatory Mary\xe2\x80\x99s heaving chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Chicot!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Matteo\xe2\x80\x99s wife the next morning. \xe2\x80\x9cMy man, he read in\r\npaper \xe2\x80\x99bout woman name\xe2\x80\x99 Boisdur\xc3\xa9, use\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99long to big-a famny. She die\r\nroun\xe2\x80\x99 on St. Philip\xe2\x80\x94po\xe2\x80\x99, same-a like church rat. It\xe2\x80\x99s any them Boisdur\xc3\xa9s\r\nyou alla talk \xe2\x80\x99bout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChicot shook his head in slow but emphatic denial. No, indeed, the woman\r\nwas not of kin to his Boisdur\xc3\xa9s. He surely had told Matteo\xe2\x80\x99s wife often\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94how many times did he have to repeat it!\xe2\x80\x94of their wealth, their\r\nsocial standing. It was doubtless some Boisdur\xc3\xa9 of _les Attakapas_; it\r\nwas none of his.\r\n\r\nThe next day there was a small funeral procession passing a little\r\ndistance away,\xe2\x80\x94a hearse and a carriage or two. There was the priest who\r\nhad attended Mamzelle Agla\xc3\xa9, and a benevolent Creole gentleman whose\r\nfather had known the Boisdur\xc3\xa9s in his youth. There was a couple of\r\nplayer-folk, who, having got wind of the story, had thrust their hands\r\ninto their pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Chicot!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Matteo\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9cYonda go the fune\xe2\x80\x99al. Mus-a be\r\nthat-a Boisdur\xc3\xa9 woman we talken \xe2\x80\x99bout yesaday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Chicot paid no heed. What was to him the funeral of a woman who had\r\ndied in St. Philip street? He did not even turn his head in the\r\ndirection of the moving procession. He went on scaling his red-snapper.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               The Lilies\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               The Lilies\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat little vagabond Mamouche amused himself one afternoon by letting\r\ndown the fence rails that protected Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s young crop of cotton and\r\ncorn. He had first looked carefully about him to make sure there was no\r\nwitness to this piece of rascality. Then he crossed the lane and did the\r\nsame with the Widow Ang\xc3\xa8le\xe2\x80\x99s fence, thereby liberating Toto, the white\r\ncalf who stood disconsolately penned up on the other side.\r\n\r\nIt was not ten seconds before Toto was frolicking madly in Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncrop, and Mamouche\xe2\x80\x94the young scamp\xe2\x80\x94was running swiftly down the lane,\r\nlaughing fiendishly to himself as he went.\r\n\r\nHe could not at first decide whether there could be more fun in letting\r\nToto demolish things at his pleasure, or in warning Mr. Billy of the\r\ncalf\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the field. But the latter course commended itself as\r\npossessing a certain refinement of perfidy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, the\xe2\x80\x99a, you!\xe2\x80\x9d called out Mamouche to one of Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s hands, when\r\nhe got around to where the men were at work; \xe2\x80\x9cyou betta go yon\xe2\x80\x99a an\xe2\x80\x99 see\r\n\xe2\x80\x99bout that calf o\xe2\x80\x99 Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Ang\xc3\xa8le; he done broke in the fiel\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout to\r\nfinish the crop, him.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Mamouche went and sat behind a big tree,\r\nwhere, unobserved, he could laugh to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content.\r\n\r\nMr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s fury was unbounded when he learned that Madame Ang\xc3\xa8le\xe2\x80\x99s calf\r\nwas eating up and trampling down his corn. At once he sent a detachment\r\nof men and boys to expel the animal from the field. Others were required\r\nto repair the damaged fence; while he himself, boiling with wrath, rode\r\nup the lane on his wicked black charger.\r\n\r\nBut merely to look upon the devastation was not enough for Mr. Billy. He\r\ndismounted from his horse, and strode belligerently up to Madame\r\nAng\xc3\xa8le\xe2\x80\x99s door, upon which he gave, with his riding-whip, a couple of\r\nsharp raps that plainly indicated the condition of his mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Billy looked taller and broader than ever as he squared himself on\r\nthe gallery of Madame Ang\xc3\xa8le\xe2\x80\x99s small and modest house. She herself\r\nhalf-opened the door, a pale, sweet-looking woman, somewhat bewildered,\r\nand holding a piece of sewing in her hands. Little Marie Louise was\r\nbeside her, with big, inquiring, frightened eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Madam!\xe2\x80\x9d blustered Mr. Billy, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a pretty piece of work!\r\nThat young beast of yours is a fence-breaker, Madam, and ought to be\r\nshot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, non, non, M\xe2\x80\x99sieur. Toto\xe2\x80\x99s too li\xe2\x80\x99le; I\xe2\x80\x99m sho he can\xe2\x80\x99t break any\r\nfence, him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t contradict me, Madam. I say he\xe2\x80\x99s a fence-breaker. There\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nproof before your eyes. He ought to be shot, I say, and\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let it\r\noccur again, Madam.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr. Billy turned and stamped down the steps\r\nwith a great clatter of spurs as he went.\r\n\r\nMadame Ang\xc3\xa8le was at the time in desperate haste to finish a young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s Easter dress, and she could not afford to let Toto\xe2\x80\x99s escapade\r\noccupy her to any extent, much as she regretted it. But little Marie\r\nLouise was greatly impressed by the affair. She went out in the yard to\r\nToto, who was under the fig-tree, looking not half so shamefaced as he\r\nought. The child, with arms clasped around the little fellow\xe2\x80\x99s white\r\nshaggy neck, scolded him roundly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you shame\xe2\x80\x99, Toto, to go eat up Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s cotton an\xe2\x80\x99 co\xe2\x80\x99n? W\xe2\x80\x99at\r\nMr. Billy ev\xe2\x80\x99a done to you, to go do him that way? If you been hungry,\r\nToto, w\xe2\x80\x99y you did\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 come like always an\xe2\x80\x99 put yo\xe2\x80\x99 head in the winda? I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 tell yo\xe2\x80\x99 maman w\xe2\x80\x99en she come back f\xe2\x80\x99om the woods to \xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99evenin\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieur.\r\n\r\nMarie Louise only ceased her mild rebuke when she fancied she saw a\r\npenitential look in Toto\xe2\x80\x99s big soft eyes.\r\n\r\nShe had a keen instinct of right and justice for so young a little maid.\r\nAnd all the afternoon, and long into the night, she was disturbed by the\r\nthought of the unfortunate accident. Of course, there could be no\r\nquestion of repaying Mr. Billy with money; she and her mother had none.\r\nNeither had they cotton and corn with which to make good the loss he had\r\nsustained through them.\r\n\r\nBut had they not something far more beautiful and precious than cotton\r\nand corn? Marie Louise thought with delight of that row of Easter lilies\r\non their tall green stems, ranged thick along the sunny side of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe assurance that she would, after all, be able to satisfy Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust anger, was a very sweet one. And soothed by it, Marie Louise soon\r\nfell asleep and dreamt a grotesque dream: that the lilies were having a\r\nstately dance on the green in the moonlight, and were inviting Mr. Billy\r\nto join them.\r\n\r\nThe following day, when it was nearing noon, Marie Louise said to her\r\nmamma: \xe2\x80\x9cMaman, can I have some of the Easter lily, to do with like I\r\nwant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Ang\xc3\xa8le was just then testing the heat of an iron with which to\r\npress out the seams in the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s Easter dress, and she answered a\r\nshade impatiently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; va t\xe2\x80\x99en, ch\xc3\xa9rie,\xe2\x80\x9d thinking that her little girl wanted to\r\npluck a lily or two.\r\n\r\nSo the child took a pair of old shears from her mother\xe2\x80\x99s basket, and out\r\nshe went to where the tall, perfumed lilies were nodding, and shaking\r\noff from their glistening petals the rain-drops with which a passing\r\ncloud had just laughingly pelted them.\r\n\r\nSnip, snap, went the shears here and there, and never did Marie Louise\r\nstop plying them till scores of those long-stemmed lilies lay upon the\r\nground. There were far more than she could hold in her small hands, so\r\nshe literally clasped the great bunch in her arms, and staggered to her\r\nfeet with it.\r\n\r\nMarie Louise was intent upon her purpose, and lost no time in its\r\naccomplishment. She was soon trudging earnestly down the lane with her\r\nsweet burden, never stopping, and only once glancing aside to cast a\r\nreproachful look at Toto, whom she had not wholly forgiven.\r\n\r\nShe did not in the least mind that the dogs barked, or that the darkies\r\nlaughed at her. She went straight on to Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s big house, and right\r\ninto the dining-room, where Mr. Billy sat eating his dinner all alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a finely-furnished room, but disorderly\xe2\x80\x94very disorderly, as an\r\nold bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s personal surroundings sometimes are. A black boy stood\r\nwaiting upon the table. When little Marie Louise suddenly appeared, with\r\nthat armful of lilies, Mr. Billy seemed for a moment transfixed at the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94bless\xe2\x80\x94my soul! what\xe2\x80\x99s all this? What\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\xe2\x80\x9d he questioned,\r\nwith staring eyes.\r\n\r\nMarie Louise had already made a little courtesy. Her sunbonnet had\r\nfallen back, leaving exposed her pretty round head; and her sweet brown\r\neyes were full of confidence as they looked into Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bring some lilies to pay back fo\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99 cotton an\xe2\x80\x99 co\xe2\x80\x99n w\xe2\x80\x99at Toto eat\r\nall up, M\xe2\x80\x99sieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Billy turned savagely upon Pompey. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at, you\r\nblack rascal? Leave the room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPompey, who out of mistaken zeal had doubled himself with merriment, was\r\ntoo accustomed to the admonition to heed it literally, and he only made\r\na pretense of withdrawing from Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLilies! well, upon my\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it the little one from across the lane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat\xe2\x80\x99s who,\xe2\x80\x9d affirmed Pompey, cautiously insinuating himself again into\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLilies! who ever heard the like? Why, the baby\xe2\x80\x99s buried under \xe2\x80\x99em. Set\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em down somewhere, little one; anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d And Marie Louise, glad to be\r\nrelieved from the weight of the great cluster, dumped them all on the\r\ntable close to Mr. Billy.\r\n\r\nThe perfume that came from the damp, massed flowers was heavy and almost\r\nsickening in its pungency. Mr. Billy quivered a little, and drew\r\ninvoluntarily back, as if from an unexpected assailant, when the odor\r\nreached him. He had been making cotton and corn for so many years, he\r\nhad forgotten there were such things as lilies in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiar \xe2\x80\x99em out? fling \xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x99way?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Pompey, who had observed his\r\nmaster cunningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x99em alone! Keep your hands off them! Leave the room, you outlandish\r\nblack scamp! What are you standing there for? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you set the Mamzelle\r\na place at table, and draw up a chair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Marie Louise\xe2\x80\x94perched upon a fine old-fashioned chair, supplemented by\r\na Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Unabridged\xe2\x80\x94sat down to dine with Mr. Billy.\r\n\r\nShe had never eaten in company with so peculiar a gentleman before; so\r\nirascible toward the inoffensive Pompey, and so courteous to herself.\r\nBut she was not ill at ease, and conducted herself properly as her mamma\r\nhad taught her how.\r\n\r\nMr. Billy was anxious that she should enjoy her dinner, and began by\r\nhelping her generously to Jambalaya. When she had tasted it she made no\r\nremark, only laid down her fork, and looked composedly before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless me! what ails the little one? You don\xe2\x80\x99t eat your rice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t cook\xe2\x80\x99, M\xe2\x80\x99sieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Marie Louise politely.\r\n\r\nPompey nearly strangled in his attempt to smother an explosion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it isn\xe2\x80\x99t cooked,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mr. Billy, excitedly, pushing away\r\nhis plate. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, setting a mess of that sort before human\r\nbeings? Do you take us for a couple of\xe2\x80\x94of rice-birds? What are you\r\nstanding there for; can\xe2\x80\x99t you look up some jam or something to keep the\r\nyoung one from starving? Where\xe2\x80\x99s all that jam I saw stewing a while\r\nback, here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPompey withdrew, and soon returned with a platter of black-looking jam.\r\nMr. Billy ordered cream for it. Pompey reported there was none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo cream, with twenty-five cows on the plantation if there\xe2\x80\x99s one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Mr. Billy, almost springing from his chair with indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Printy \xe2\x80\x99low she sot de pan o\xe2\x80\x99 cream on de winda-sell, suh, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nUnc\xe2\x80\x99 Jonah come \xe2\x80\x99long an\xe2\x80\x99 tu\xe2\x80\x99n it cl\xe2\x80\x99ar ova; neva lef\xe2\x80\x99 a drap in de\r\npan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut evidently the jam, with or without cream, was as distasteful to\r\nMarie Louise as the rice was; for after tasting it gingerly she laid\r\naway her spoon as she had done before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no! little one; you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me it isn\xe2\x80\x99t cooked this time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlaughed Mr. Billy. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw the thing boiling a day and a half. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\na day and a half, Pompey? if you know how to tell the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Printy alluz do cooks her p\xe2\x80\x99esarves tell dey plumb done, sho,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nagreed Pompey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s burn\xe2\x80\x99, M\xe2\x80\x99sieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marie Louise, politely, but decidedly, to\r\nthe utter confusion of Mr. Billy, who was as mortified as could be at\r\nthe failure of his dinner to please his fastidious little visitor.\r\n\r\nWell, Mr. Billy thought of Marie Louise a good deal after that; as long\r\nas the lilies lasted. And they lasted long, for he had the whole\r\nhousehold employed in taking care of them. Often he would chuckle to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cThe little rogue, with her black eyes and her lilies! And the\r\nrice wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cooked, if you please; and the jam was burnt. And the best\r\nof it is, she was right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when the lilies withered finally, and had to be thrown away, Mr.\r\nBilly donned his best suit, a starched shirt and fine silk necktie. Thus\r\nattired, he crossed the lane to carry his somewhat tardy apologies to\r\nMadame Ang\xc3\xa8le and Mamzelle Marie Louise, and to pay them a first visit.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                 Az\xc3\xa9lie\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                 Az\xc3\xa9lie\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nAz\xc3\xa9lie crossed the yard with slow, hesitating steps. She wore a pink\r\nsunbonnet and a faded calico dress that had been made the summer before,\r\nand was now too small for her in every way. She carried a large tin pail\r\non her arm. When within a few yards of the house she stopped under a\r\nchinaberry-tree, quite still, except for the occasional slow turning of\r\nher head from side to side.\r\n\r\nMr. Mathurin, from his elevation upon the upper gallery, laughed when he\r\nsaw her; for he knew she would stay there, motionless, till some one\r\nnoticed and questioned her.\r\n\r\nThe planter was just home from the city, and was therefore in an\r\nexcellent humor, as he always was, on getting back to what he called _le\r\ngrand air_, the space and stillness of the country, and the scent of the\r\nfields. He was in shirtsleeves, walking around the gallery that\r\nencircled the big square white house. Beneath was a brick-paved portico\r\nupon which the lower rooms opened. At wide intervals were large\r\nwhitewashed pillars that supported the upper gallery.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the lower house was the store, which was in no sense a\r\nstore for the general public, but maintained only to supply the needs of\r\nMr. Mathurin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh bien! what do you want, Az\xc3\xa9lie?\xe2\x80\x9d the planter finally called out to\r\nthe girl in French. She advanced a few paces, and, pushing back her\r\nsunbonnet, looked up at him with a gentle, inoffensive face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto which\r\nyou would give the good God without confession,\xe2\x80\x9d he once described it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBon jou\xe2\x80\x99, M\xe2\x80\x99si\xe2\x80\x99 Mathurin,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; and continued in English: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncome git a li\xe2\x80\x99le piece o\xe2\x80\x99 meat. We plumb out o\xe2\x80\x99 meat home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, the meat is n\xe2\x80\x99 going to walk to you, my chile: it has n\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngot feet. Go fine Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte. He\xe2\x80\x99s yonda mending his buggy unda the\r\nshed.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned away with an alert little step, and went in search of\r\nMr. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s you again!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man exclaimed, with a pretended air of\r\nannoyance, when he saw her. He straightened himself, and looked down at\r\nher and her pail with a comprehending glance. The sweat was standing in\r\nshining beads on his brown, good-looking face. He was in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, and the legs of his trousers were thrust into the tops of\r\nhis fine, high-heeled boots. He wore his straw hat very much on one\r\nside, and had an air that was altogether _fanfaron_. He reached to a\r\nback pocket for the store key, which was as large as the pistol that he\r\nsometimes carried in the same place. She followed him across the thick,\r\ntufted grass of the yard with quick, short steps that strove to keep\r\npace with his longer, swinging ones.\r\n\r\nWhen he had unlocked and opened the heavy door of the store, there\r\nescaped from the close room the strong, pungent odor of the varied wares\r\nand provisions massed within. Az\xc3\xa9lie seemed to like the odor, and,\r\nlifting her head, snuffed the air as people sometimes do upon entering a\r\nconservatory filled with fragrant flowers.\r\n\r\nA broad ray of light streamed in through the open door, illumining the\r\ndingy interior. The double wooden shutters of the windows were all\r\nclosed, and secured on the inside by iron hooks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, w\xe2\x80\x99at you want, Az\xc3\xa9lie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked \xe2\x80\x99Polyte, going behind the counter\r\nwith an air of hurry and importance. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t got time to fool. Make\r\nhas\xe2\x80\x99e; say w\xe2\x80\x99at you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer reply was precisely the same that she had made to Mr. Mathurin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come git a li\xe2\x80\x99le piece o\xe2\x80\x99 meat. We plumb out o\xe2\x80\x99 meat home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed exasperated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBont\xc3\xa9! w\xe2\x80\x99at you all do with meat yonda? You don\xe2\x80\x99t reflec\xe2\x80\x99 you about to\r\neat up yo\xe2\x80\x99 crop befo\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s good out o\xe2\x80\x99 the groun\xe2\x80\x99, you all. I like to\r\nknow w\xe2\x80\x99y yo\xe2\x80\x99 pa don\xe2\x80\x99t go he\xe2\x80\x99p with the killin\xe2\x80\x99 once aw\xe2\x80\x99ile, an\xe2\x80\x99 git some\r\nfresh meat fo\xe2\x80\x99 a change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered in an unshaded, unmodulated voice that was penetrating,\r\nlike a child\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x9cPopa he do go he\xe2\x80\x99p wid the killin\xe2\x80\x99; but he say he can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwork \xe2\x80\x99less he got salt meat. He got plenty to feed\xe2\x80\x94him. He\xe2\x80\x99s got to hire\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99p wid his crop, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s boun\xe2\x80\x99 to feed \xe2\x80\x99em; they won\xe2\x80\x99t year no\r\ndiffe\xe2\x80\x99nt. An\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s got gra\xe2\x80\x99ma to feed, an\xe2\x80\x99 Sauterelle, an\xe2\x80\x99 me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 all the lazy-bone \xe2\x80\x99Cadians in the country that know w\xe2\x80\x99ere they\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 to fine the coffee-pot always in the corna of the fire,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Polyte.\r\n\r\nWith an iron hook he lifted a small piece of salt meat from the pork\r\nbarrel, weighed it, and placed it in her pail. Then she wanted a little\r\ncoffee. He gave it to her reluctantly. He was still more loath to let\r\nher have sugar; and when she asked for lard, he refused flatly.\r\n\r\nShe had taken off her sunbonnet, and was fanning herself with it, as she\r\nleaned with her elbows upon the counter, and let her eyes travel\r\nlingeringly along the well-lined shelves. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte stood staring into her\r\nface with a sense of aggravation that her presence, her manner, always\r\nstirred up in him.\r\n\r\nThe face was colorless but for the red, curved line of the lips. Her\r\neyes were dark, wide, innocent, questioning eyes, and her black hair was\r\nplastered smooth back from the forehead and temples. There was no trace\r\nof any intention of coquetry in her manner. He resented this as a token\r\nof indifference toward his sex, and thought it inexcusable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Az\xc3\xa9lie, if it\xe2\x80\x99s anything you don\xe2\x80\x99t see, ask fo\xe2\x80\x99 it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsuggested, with what he flattered himself was humor. But there was no\r\nresponsive humor in Az\xc3\xa9lie\xe2\x80\x99s composition. She seriously drew a small\r\nflask from her pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPopa say, if you want to let him have a li\xe2\x80\x99le dram, \xe2\x80\x99count o\xe2\x80\x99 his pains\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99bout to cripple him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYo\xe2\x80\x99 pa knows as well as I do we don\xe2\x80\x99t sell w\xe2\x80\x99isky. Mr. Mathurin don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncarry no license.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. He say if you want to give \xe2\x80\x99im a li\xe2\x80\x99le dram, he\xe2\x80\x99s willin\xe2\x80\x99 to do\r\nsome work fo\xe2\x80\x99 you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Once fo\xe2\x80\x99 all, no!\xe2\x80\x9d And \xe2\x80\x99Polyte reached for the day-book, in which\r\nto enter the articles he had given to her.\r\n\r\nBut Az\xc3\xa9lie\xe2\x80\x99s needs were not yet satisfied. She wanted tobacco; he would\r\nnot give it to her. A spool of thread; he rolled one up, together with\r\ntwo sticks of peppermint candy, and placed it in her pail. When she\r\nasked for a bottle of coal-oil, he grudgingly consented, but assured her\r\nit would be useless to cudgel her brain further, for he would positively\r\nlet her have nothing more. He disappeared toward the coal-oil tank,\r\nwhich was hidden from view behind the piled-up boxes on the counter.\r\nWhen she heard him searching for an empty quart bottle, and making a\r\nclatter with the tin funnels, she herself withdrew from the counter\r\nagainst which she had been leaning.\r\n\r\nAfter they quitted the store, \xe2\x80\x99Polyte, with a perplexed expression upon\r\nhis face, leaned for a moment against one of the whitewashed pillars,\r\nwatching the girl cross the yard. She had folded her sunbonnet into a\r\npad, which she placed beneath the heavy pail that she balanced upon her\r\nhead. She walked upright, with a slow, careful tread. Two of the yard\r\ndogs that had stood a moment before upon the threshold of the store\r\ndoor, quivering and wagging their tails, were following her now, with a\r\nlittle businesslike trot. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte called them back.\r\n\r\nThe cabin which the girl occupied with her father, her grandmother, and\r\nher little brother Sauterelle, was removed some distance from the\r\nplantation house, and only its pointed roof could be discerned like a\r\nspeck far away across the field of cotton, which was all in bloom. Her\r\nfigure soon disappeared from view, and \xe2\x80\x99Polyte emerged from the shelter\r\nof the gallery, and started again toward his interrupted task. He turned\r\nto say to the planter, who was keeping up his measured tramp above:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mathurin, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it \xe2\x80\x99mos\xe2\x80\x99 time to stop givin\xe2\x80\x99 credit to Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nPauch\xc3\xa9. Look like that crop o\xe2\x80\x99 his ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to start to pay his\r\naccount. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see, me, anyway, how you come to take that triflin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nLi\xe2\x80\x99le river gang on the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it was a mistake, \xe2\x80\x99Polyte, but que voulez-vous?\xe2\x80\x9d the planter\r\nreturned, with a good-natured shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cNow they are yere, we can\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nthem starve, my frien\xe2\x80\x99. Push them to work all you can. Hole back all\r\nsupplies that are not necessary, an\xe2\x80\x99 nex\xe2\x80\x99 year we will let some one else\r\nenjoy the privilege of feeding them,\xe2\x80\x9d he ended, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish they was all back on Li\xe2\x80\x99le river,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x99Polyte muttered under his\r\nbreath as he turned and walked slowly away.\r\n\r\nDirectly back of the store was the young man\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping-room. He had\r\nmade himself quite comfortable there in his corner. He had screened his\r\nwindows and doors; planted Madeira vines, which now formed a thick green\r\ncurtain between the two pillars that faced his room; and had swung a\r\nhammock out there, in which he liked well to repose himself after the\r\nfatigues of the day.\r\n\r\nHe lay long in the hammock that evening, thinking over the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappenings and the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s work, half dozing, half dreaming, and wholly\r\npossessed by the charm of the night, the warm, sweeping air that blew\r\nthrough the long corridor, and the almost unbroken stillness that\r\nenveloped him.\r\n\r\nAt times his random thoughts formed themselves into an almost inaudible\r\nspeech: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish she would go \xe2\x80\x99way f\xe2\x80\x99om yere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the dogs came and thrust his cool, moist muzzle against \xe2\x80\x99Polyte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheek. He caressed the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s shaggy head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know w\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatta with her,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99lieve she\xe2\x80\x99s got good sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a long time afterward that he murmured again: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to God\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d go \xe2\x80\x99way f\xe2\x80\x99om yere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe edge of the moon crept up\xe2\x80\x94a keen, curved blade of light above the\r\ndark line of the cotton-field. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte roused himself when he saw it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99 know it was so late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself\xe2\x80\x94or to his dog. He entered\r\nhis room at once, and was soon in bed, sleeping soundly.\r\n\r\nIt was some hours later that \xe2\x80\x99Polyte was roused from his sleep by\xe2\x80\x94he did\r\nnot know what; his senses were too scattered and confused to determine\r\nat once. There was at first no sound; then so faint a one that he\r\nwondered how he could have heard it. A door of his room communicated\r\nwith the store, but this door was never used, and was almost completely\r\nblocked by wares piled up on the other side. The faint noise that\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Polyte heard, and which came from within the store, was followed by a\r\nflare of light that he could discern through the chinks, and that lasted\r\nas long as a match might burn.\r\n\r\nHe was now fully aware that some one was in the store. How the intruder\r\nhad entered he could not guess, for the key was under his pillow with\r\nhis watch and his pistol.\r\n\r\nAs cautiously as he could he donned an extra garment, thrust his bare\r\nfeet into slippers, and crept out into the portico, pistol in hand.\r\n\r\nThe shutters of one of the store windows were open. He stood close to\r\nit, and waited, which he considered surer and safer than to enter the\r\ndark and crowded confines of the store to engage in what might prove a\r\nbootless struggle with the intruder.\r\n\r\nHe had not long to wait. In a few moments some one darted through the\r\nopen window as nimbly as a cat. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte staggered back as if a heavy\r\nblow had stunned him. His first thought and his first exclamation were:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! how close I come to killin\xe2\x80\x99 you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Az\xc3\xa9lie. She uttered no cry, but made one quick effort to run when\r\nshe saw him. He seized her arm and held her with a brutal grip. He put\r\nthe pistol back into his pocket. He was shaking like a man with the\r\npalsy. One by one he took from her the parcels she was carrying, and\r\nflung them back into the store. There were not many: some packages of\r\ntobacco, a cheap pipe, some fishing-tackle, and the flask which she had\r\nbrought with her in the afternoon. This he threw into the yard. It was\r\nstill empty, for she had not been able to find the \xe2\x80\x9ckey\xe2\x80\x9d to the\r\nwhisky-barrel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x94so, you a thief!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered savagely under his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hurtin\xe2\x80\x99 me, Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte,\xe2\x80\x9d she complained, squirming. He somewhat\r\nrelaxed, but did not relinquish, his hold upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t no thief,\xe2\x80\x9d she blurted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was stealin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he contradicted her sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99 stealin\xe2\x80\x99. I was jus\xe2\x80\x99 takin\xe2\x80\x99 a few li\xe2\x80\x99le things you all too mean\r\nto gi\xe2\x80\x99 me. You all treat my popa like he was a dog. It\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y las\xe2\x80\x99 week\r\nMr. Mathurin sen\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99way to the city to fetch a fine buckboa\xe2\x80\x99d fo\xe2\x80\x99 Son\r\nAmbroise, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y a nigga, apr\xc3\xa8s tout. An\xe2\x80\x99 my popa he want a\r\npicayune tobacca? It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke loud in her monotonous, shrill\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte kept saying: \xe2\x80\x9cHush, I tell you! Hush! Somebody\xe2\x80\x99ll year\r\nyou. Hush! It\xe2\x80\x99s enough you broke in the sto\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94how you got in the sto\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, looking from her to the open window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was w\xe2\x80\x99en you was behine the boxes to the coal-oil tank\xe2\x80\x94I unhook\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 you don\xe2\x80\x99 know I could sen\xe2\x80\x99 you to Baton Rouge fo\xe2\x80\x99 that?\xe2\x80\x9d He shook\r\nher as though trying to rouse her to a comprehension of her grievous\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJus\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99 a li\xe2\x80\x99le picayune o\xe2\x80\x99 tobacca!\xe2\x80\x9d she whimpered.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly abandoned his hold upon her, and left her free. She\r\nmechanically rubbed the arm that he had grasped so violently.\r\n\r\nBetween the long row of pillars the moon was sending pale beams of\r\nlight. In one of these they were standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAz\xc3\xa9lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cgo \xe2\x80\x99way f\xe2\x80\x99om yere quick; some one might fine you\r\nyere. W\xe2\x80\x99en you want something in the sto\xe2\x80\x99, fo\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f or fo\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99 pa\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99 care\xe2\x80\x94ask me fo\xe2\x80\x99 it. But you\xe2\x80\x94but you can\xe2\x80\x99t neva set yo\xe2\x80\x99 foot inside\r\nthat sto\xe2\x80\x99 again. Co \xe2\x80\x99way f\xe2\x80\x99on yere quick as you can, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried in no way to conciliate him. She turned and walked away over\r\nthe same ground she had crossed before. One of the big dogs started to\r\nfollow her. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte did not call him back this time. He knew no harm\r\ncould come to her, going through those lonely fields, while the animal\r\nwas at her side.\r\n\r\nHe went at once to his room for the store key that was beneath his\r\npillow. He entered the store, and refastened the window. When he had\r\nmade everything once more secure, he sat dejectedly down upon a bench\r\nthat was in the portico. He sat for a long time motionless. Then,\r\novercome by some powerful feeling that was at work within him, he buried\r\nhis face in his hands and wept, his whole body shaken by the violence of\r\nhis sobs.\r\n\r\nAfter that night \xe2\x80\x99Polyte loved Az\xc3\xa9lie desperately. The very action which\r\nshould have revolted him had seemed, on the contrary, to inflame him\r\nwith love. He felt that love to be a degradation\xe2\x80\x94something that he was\r\nalmost ashamed to acknowledge to himself; and he knew that he was\r\nhopelessly unable to stifle it.\r\n\r\nHe watched now in a tremor for her coming. She came very often, for she\r\nremembered every word he had said; and she did not hesitate to ask him\r\nfor those luxuries which she considered necessities to her \xe2\x80\x9cpopa\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexistence. She never attempted to enter the store, but always waited\r\noutside, of her own accord, laughing, and playing with the dogs. She\r\nseemed to have no shame or regret for what she had done, and plainly did\r\nnot realize that it was a disgraceful act. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte often shuddered with\r\ndisgust to discern in her a being so wholly devoid of moral sense.\r\n\r\nHe had always been an industrious, bustling fellow, never idle. Now\r\nthere were hours and hours in which he did nothing but long for the\r\nsight of Az\xc3\xa9lie. Even when at work there was that gnawing want at his\r\nheart to see her, often so urgent that he would leave everything to\r\nwander down by her cabin with the hope of seeing her. It was even\r\nsomething if he could catch a glimpse of Sauterelle playing in the\r\nweeds, or of Ars\xc3\xa8ne lazily dragging himself about, and smoking the pipe\r\nwhich rarely left his lips now that he was kept so well supplied with\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nOnce, down the bank of the bayou, when \xe2\x80\x99Polyte came upon Az\xc3\xa9lie\r\nunexpectedly, and was therefore unprepared to resist the shock of her\r\nsudden appearance, he seized her in his arms, and covered her face with\r\nkisses. She was not indignant; she was not flustered or agitated, as\r\nmight have been a susceptible, coquettish girl; she was only astonished,\r\nand annoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at you doin\xe2\x80\x99, Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me \xe2\x80\x99lone, I\r\nsay! Leave me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, I love you, I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered helplessly over and\r\nover in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mus\xe2\x80\x99 los\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99 head,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him, red from the effort of the\r\nstruggle, when he released her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou right, Az\xc3\xa9lie; I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve I los\xe2\x80\x99 my head,\xe2\x80\x9d and he climbed up the\r\nbank of the bayou as fast as he could.\r\n\r\nAfter that his behavior was shameful, and he knew it, and he did not\r\ncare. He invented pretexts that would enable him to touch her hand with\r\nhis. He wanted to kiss her again, and told her she might come into the\r\nstore as she used to do. There was no need for her to unhook a window\r\nnow; he gave her whatever she asked for, charging it always to his own\r\naccount on the books. She permitted his caresses without returning them,\r\nand yet that was all he seemed to live for now. He gave her a little\r\ngold ring.\r\n\r\nHe was looking eagerly forward to the close of the season, when Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nwould go back to Little River. He had arranged to ask Az\xc3\xa9lie to marry\r\nhim. He would keep her with him when the others went away. He longed to\r\nrescue her from what he felt to be the demoralizing influences of her\r\nfamily and her surroundings. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte believed he would be able to awaken\r\nAz\xc3\xa9lie to finer, better impulses when he should have her apart to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut when the time came to propose it, Az\xc3\xa9lie looked at him in amazement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, b\xe2\x80\x99en, no. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to stay yere wid you, Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Polyte; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 yonda on Li\xe2\x80\x99le river wid my popa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis resolve frightened him, but he pretended not to believe it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jokin\xe2\x80\x99, Az\xc3\xa9lie; you mus\xe2\x80\x99 care a li\xe2\x80\x99le about me. It looked to me all\r\nalong like you cared some about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 my popa, donc? Ah, b\xe2\x80\x99en, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99 rememba how lonesome it is on Li\xe2\x80\x99le river, Az\xc3\xa9lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99enever I think \xe2\x80\x99bout Li\xe2\x80\x99le river it always make me sad\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nI think about a graveyard. To me it\xe2\x80\x99s like a person mus\xe2\x80\x99 die, one way or\r\notha, w\xe2\x80\x99en they go on Li\xe2\x80\x99le river. Oh, I hate it! Stay with me, Az\xc3\xa9lie;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99 go \xe2\x80\x99way f\xe2\x80\x99om me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said little, one way or the other, after that, when she had fully\r\nunderstood his wishes, and her reserve led him to believe, since he\r\nhoped it, that he had prevailed with her and that she had determined to\r\nstay with him and be his wife.\r\n\r\nIt was a cool, crisp morning in December that they went away. In a\r\nramshackle wagon, drawn by an ill-mated team, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Pauch\xc3\xa9 and his\r\nfamily left Mr. Mathurin\xe2\x80\x99s plantation for their old familiar haunts on\r\nLittle river. The grandmother, looking like a witch, with a black shawl\r\ntied over her head, sat upon a roll of bedding in the bottom of the\r\nwagon. Sauterelle\xe2\x80\x99s bead-like eyes glittered with mischief as he peeped\r\nover the side. Az\xc3\xa9lie, with the pink sunbonnet completely hiding her\r\nround young face, sat beside her father, who drove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Polyte caught one glimpse of the group as they passed in the road.\r\nTurning, he hurried into his room, and locked himself in.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that \xe2\x80\x99Polyte\xe2\x80\x99s services were going to count for\r\nlittle. He himself was the first to realize this. One day he approached\r\nthe planter, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mathurin, befo\xe2\x80\x99 we start anotha year\r\ntogetha, I betta tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to quit.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x99Polyte stood upon the\r\nsteps, and leaned back against the railing. The planter was a little\r\nabove on the gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at in the name o\xe2\x80\x99 sense are you talking about, \xe2\x80\x99Polyte!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed\r\nin astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s jus\xe2\x80\x99 that; I\xe2\x80\x99m boun\xe2\x80\x99 to quit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had a better offer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I ain\xe2\x80\x99t had no offa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen explain yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f, my frien\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94explain yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f,\xe2\x80\x9d requested Mr.\r\nMathurin, with something of offended dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you leave me, w\xe2\x80\x99ere\r\nare you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Polyte was beating his leg with his limp felt hat. \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon I jus\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\nwell go yonda on Li\xe2\x80\x99le river\xe2\x80\x94w\xe2\x80\x99ere Az\xc3\xa9lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                Mamouche\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                Mamouche\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMamouche stood within the open doorway, which he had just entered. It\r\nwas night; the rain was falling in torrents, and the water trickled from\r\nhim as it would have done from an umbrella, if he had carried one.\r\n\r\nOld Doctor John-Luis, who was toasting his feet before a blazing\r\nhickory-wood fire, turned to gaze at the youngster through his\r\nspectacles. Marshall, the old negro who had opened the door at the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknock, also looked down at him, and indignantly said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x99long back on de gall\xe2\x80\x99ry an\xe2\x80\x99 drip yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f! W\xe2\x80\x99at Cynthy gwine say\r\ntomorrow w\xe2\x80\x99en she see dat flo\xe2\x80\x99 mess\xe2\x80\x99 up dat away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to the fire and sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor John-Luis.\r\n\r\nDoctor John-Luis was a bachelor. He was small and thin; he wore\r\nsnuff-colored clothes that were a little too large for him, and\r\nspectacles. Time had not deprived him of an abundant crop of hair that\r\nhad once been red, and was not now more than half-bleached.\r\n\r\nThe boy looked irresolutely from master to man; then went and sat down\r\nbeside the fire on a splint-bottom chair. He sat so close to the blaze\r\nthat had he been an apple he would have roasted. As he was but a small\r\nboy, clothed in wet rags, he only steamed.\r\n\r\nMarshall grumbled audibly, and Doctor John-Luis continued to inspect the\r\nboy through his glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarsh, bring him something to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded, tentatively.\r\n\r\nMarshall hesitated, and challenged the child with a speculating look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs you w\xe2\x80\x99ite o\xe2\x80\x99 is you black?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDat w\xe2\x80\x99at I wants ter know\r\n\xe2\x80\x99fo\xe2\x80\x99 I kiar\xe2\x80\x99 victuals to yo in de settin\xe2\x80\x99-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m w\xe2\x80\x99ite, me,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy responded, promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t disputin\xe2\x80\x99; go ahead. All right fer dem w\xe2\x80\x99at wants ter take yo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwud fer it.\xe2\x80\x9d Doctor John-Luis coughed behind his hand and said nothing.\r\n\r\nMarshall brought a platter of cold food to the boy, who rested the dish\r\nupon his knees and ate from it with keen appetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Doctor John-Luis, when his caller\r\nstopped for breath. Mamouche turned a pair of big, soft, dark eyes upon\r\nhis questioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come frum Cloutierville this mo\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99. I been try to git to the\r\ntwenty-fo\xe2\x80\x99-mile ferry w\xe2\x80\x99en de rain ketch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you going to do at the twenty-four-mile ferry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy gazed absently into the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99 know w\xe2\x80\x99at I was goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\ndo yonda to the twenty-fo\xe2\x80\x99-mile ferry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must be a tramp, to be wandering aimlessly about the country\r\nin that way!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I don\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99lieve I\xe2\x80\x99m a tramp, me.\xe2\x80\x9d Mamouche was wriggling his toes\r\nwith enjoyment of the warmth and palatable food.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Doctor John-Luis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name it\xe2\x80\x99s Mamouche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mamouche.\xe2\x80\x99 Fiddlesticks! That\xe2\x80\x99s no name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy looked as if he regretted the fact, while not being able to help\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my pa, his name it was Mathurin Pelot\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d he offered in some\r\npalliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPelot\xc3\xa9! Pelot\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d mused Doctor John-Luis. \xe2\x80\x9cAny kin to Th\xc3\xa9odule Pelot\xc3\xa9\r\nwho lived formerly in Avoyelles parish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99y, yas!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Mamouche. \xe2\x80\x9cTh\xc3\xa9odule Pelot\xc3\xa9, it was my gran\xe2\x80\x99pa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour grandfather? Well, upon my word!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked again, critically, at\r\nthe youngster\xe2\x80\x99s rags. \xe2\x80\x9cThen St\xc3\xa9phanie Galopin must have been your\r\ngrandmother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYas,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Mamouche, complacently; \xe2\x80\x9cthat who was my gran\xe2\x80\x99ma. She\r\ndie two year ago down by Alexandria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarsh,\xe2\x80\x9d called Doctor John-Luis, turning in his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cbring him a mug\r\nof milk and another piece of pie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mamouche had eaten all the good things that were set before him, he\r\nfound that one side of him was quite dry, and he transferred himself\r\nover to the other corner of the fire so as to turn to the blaze the side\r\nwhich was still wet.\r\n\r\nThe action seemed to amuse Doctor John-Luis, whose old head began to\r\nfill with recollections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat reminds me of Th\xc3\xa9odule,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, he was a great fellow,\r\nyour father, Th\xc3\xa9odule!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gran\xe2\x80\x99pa,\xe2\x80\x9d corrected Mamouche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, your grandfather. He was handsome; I tell you, he was\r\ngood-looking. And the way he could dance and play the fiddle and sing!\r\nLet me see, how did that song go that he used to sing when we went out\r\nserenading: \xe2\x80\x98A ta\xe2\x80\x94\xc3\xa0 ta\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x98A ta fen\xc3\xaatre\r\n                    Daignes para\xc3\xaetre\xe2\x80\x94tra la la la!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor John-Luis\xe2\x80\x99s voice, even in his youth, could not have been\r\nagreeable; and now it bore no resemblance to any sound that Mamouche had\r\never heard issue from a human throat. The boy kicked his heels and\r\nrolled sideward on his chair with enjoyment. Doctor John-Luis laughed\r\neven more heartily, finished the stanza, and sang another one through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what turned the girls\xe2\x80\x99 heads, I tell you, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when\r\nhe had recovered his breath; \xe2\x80\x9cthat fiddling and dancing and tra la la.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the next hour the old man lived again through his youth; through\r\nany number of alluring experiences with his friend Th\xc3\xa9odule, that merry\r\nfellow who had never done a steady week\xe2\x80\x99s work in his life; and\r\nSt\xc3\xa9phanie, the pretty Acadian girl, whom he had never wholly understood,\r\neven to this day.\r\n\r\nIt was quite late when Doctor John-Luis climbed the stairs that led from\r\nthe sitting-room up to his bedchamber. As he went, followed by the ever\r\nattentive Marshall, he was singing:\r\n\r\n                           \xe2\x80\x9cA ta fen\xc3\xaatre\r\n                           Daignes para\xc3\xaetre,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nbut very low, so as not to awaken Mamouche, whom he left sleeping upon a\r\nbed that Marshall at his order had prepared for the boy beside the\r\nsitting-room fire.\r\n\r\nAt a very early hour next morning Marshall appeared at his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedside with the accustomed morning coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Doctor John-Luis, as he sugared and stirred\r\nthe tiny cup of black coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho dat, sah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the boy, Mamouche. What is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gone, sah. He done gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYas, sah. He roll his bed up in de corner; he onlock de do\xe2\x80\x99; he gone.\r\nBut de silver an\xe2\x80\x99 ev\xe2\x80\x99thing dah; he ain\xe2\x80\x99t kiar\xe2\x80\x99 nuttin\xe2\x80\x99 off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarshall,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Doctor John-Luis, ill-humoredly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are times\r\nwhen you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have sense and penetration enough to talk about!\r\nI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll take another nap,\xe2\x80\x9d he grumbled, as he turned his back upon\r\nMarshall. \xe2\x80\x9cWake me at seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no ordinary thing for Doctor John-Luis to be in a bad humor, and\r\nperhaps it is not strictly true to say that he was now. He was only in a\r\nlittle less amiable mood than usual when he pulled on his high rubber\r\nboots and went splashing out in the wet to see what his people were\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nHe might have owned a large plantation had he wished to own one, for a\r\nlong life of persistent, intelligent work had left him with a\r\ncomfortable fortune in his old age; but he preferred the farm on which\r\nhe lived contentedly and raised an abundance to meet his modest wants.\r\n\r\nHe went down to the orchard, where a couple of men were busying\r\nthemselves in setting out a line of young fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut, tut!\xe2\x80\x9d They were doing it all wrong; the line was not\r\nstraight; the holes were not deep. It was strange that he had to come\r\ndown there and discover such things with his old eyes!\r\n\r\nHe poked his head into the kitchen to complain to Prudence about the\r\nducks that she had not seasoned properly the day before, and to hope\r\nthat the accident would never occur again.\r\n\r\nHe tramped over to where a carpenter was working on a gate; securing\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94as he meant to secure all the gates upon his place\xe2\x80\x94with great patent\r\nclamps and ingenious hinges, intended to baffle utterly the designs of\r\nthe evil-disposed persons who had lately been tampering with them. For\r\nthere had been a malicious spirit abroad, who played tricks, it seemed,\r\nfor pure wantonness upon the farmers and planters, and caused them\r\ninfinite annoyance.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. John-Luis contemplated the carpenter at work, and remembered how\r\nhis gates had recently all been lifted from their hinges one night and\r\nleft lying upon the ground, the provoking nature of the offense dawned\r\nupon him as it had not done before. He turned swiftly, prompted by a\r\nsudden determination, and re-entered the house.\r\n\r\nThen he proceeded to write out in immense black characters a half-dozen\r\nplacards. It was an offer of twenty-five dollars\xe2\x80\x99 reward for the capture\r\nof the person guilty of the malicious offence already described. These\r\nplacards were sent abroad with the same eager haste that had conceived\r\nand executed them.\r\n\r\nAfter a day or two, Doctor John-Luis\xe2\x80\x99 ill humor had resolved itself into\r\na pensive melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarsh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know, after all, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather dreary to be living\r\nalone as I do, without any companion\xe2\x80\x94of my own color, you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knows dat, sah. It sho\xe2\x80\x99 am lonesome,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sympathetic\r\nMarshall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Marsh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking lately,\xe2\x80\x9d and Doctor John-Luis\r\ncoughed, for he disliked the inaccuracy of that \xe2\x80\x9clately.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nthinking that this property and wealth that I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked so hard to\r\naccumulate, are after all doing no permanent, practical good to any one.\r\nNow, if I could find some well-disposed boy whom I might train to work,\r\nto study, to lead a decent, honest life\xe2\x80\x94a boy of good heart who would\r\ncare for me in my old age; for I am still comparatively\xe2\x80\x94hem\xe2\x80\x94not old?\r\nhey, Marsh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey ain\xe2\x80\x99t one in de pa\xe2\x80\x99ish hole yo\xe2\x80\x99 own like you does, sah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. Now, can you think of such a boy? Try to think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarshall slowly scratched his head and looked reflective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can think of such a boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor John-Luis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might\r\nbring him here to spend an evening with me, you know, without hinting at\r\nmy intentions, of course. In that way I could sound him; study him up,\r\nas it were. For a step of such importance is not to be taken without due\r\nconsideration, Marsh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, the first whom Marshall brought was one of Baptiste Choupic\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboys. He was a very timid child, and sat on the edge of his chair,\r\nfearfully. He replied in jerky mono-*syllables when Doctor John-Luis\r\nspoke to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYas, sah\xe2\x80\x94no, sah,\xe2\x80\x9d as the case might be; with a little\r\nnervous bob of the head.\r\n\r\nHis presence made the doctor quite uncomfortable. He was glad to be rid\r\nof the boy at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when he sent him home with some oranges and\r\na few sweetmeats.\r\n\r\nThen Marshall had Theodore over; an unfortunate selection that evinced\r\nlittle judgment on Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s part. Not to mince matters, the boy was\r\npainfully forward. He monopolized the conversation; asked impertinent\r\nquestions and handled and inspected everything in the room. Dr.\r\nJohn-Luis sent him home with an orange and not a single sweet.\r\n\r\nThen there was Hyppolite, who was too ugly to be thought of; and Cami,\r\nwho was heavy and stupid, and fell asleep in his chair with his mouth\r\nwide open. And so it went. If Doctor John-Luis had hoped in the company\r\nof any of these boys to repeat the agreeable evening he had passed with\r\nMamouche, he was sadly deceived.\r\n\r\nAt last he instructed Marshall to discontinue the search of that ideal\r\ncompanion he had dreamed of. He was resigned to spend the remainder of\r\nhis days without one.\r\n\r\nThen, one day when it was raining again, and very muddy and chill, a\r\nred-faced man came driving up to Doctor John-Luis\xe2\x80\x99 door in a dilapidated\r\nbuggy. He lifted a boy from the vehicle, whom he held with a vise-like\r\nclutch, and whom he straightway dragged into the astonished presence of\r\nDoctor John-Luis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the red-faced man. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got him at last!\r\nHere he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Mamouche, covered with mud, the picture of misery. Doctor\r\nJohn-Luis stood with his back to the fire. He was startled, and visibly\r\nand painfully moved at the sight of the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThen it was you, Mamouche, who did this\r\nmischievous thing to me? Lifting my gates from their hinges; letting the\r\nchickens in among my flowers to ruin them; and the hogs and cattle to\r\ntrample and uproot my vegetables!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the red-faced man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat game\xe2\x80\x99s played out, now;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nDoctor John-Luis looked as if he wanted to strike him.\r\n\r\nMamouche seemed unable to reply. His lower lip was quivering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYas, it\xe2\x80\x99s me!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s me w\xe2\x80\x99at take yo\xe2\x80\x99 gates off the\r\nhinge. It\xe2\x80\x99s me w\xe2\x80\x99at turn loose Mr. Morgin\xe2\x80\x99s hoss, w\xe2\x80\x99en Mr. Morgin was\r\npassing _veill\xc3\xa9e_ wid his sweetheart. It\xe2\x80\x99s me w\xe2\x80\x99at take down Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame\r\nAng\xc3\xa8le\xe2\x80\x99s fence, an\xe2\x80\x99 lef her calf loose to tramp in Mr. Billy\xe2\x80\x99s cotton.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s me w\xe2\x80\x99at play like a ghos\xe2\x80\x99 by the graveyard las\xe2\x80\x99 Toussaint to scare\r\nthe darkies passin\xe2\x80\x99 in the road. It\xe2\x80\x99s me w\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe confession had burst out from the depth of Mamouche\xe2\x80\x99s heart like a\r\ntorrent, and there is no telling when it would have stopped if Doctor\r\nJohn-Luis had not enjoined silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as severely as he could, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you left my\r\nhouse like a criminal, in the morning, secretly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears had begun to course down Mamouche\xe2\x80\x99s brown cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was \xe2\x80\x99shame\xe2\x80\x99 of myse\xe2\x80\x99f, that\xe2\x80\x99s w\xe2\x80\x99y. If you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 gave me no suppa,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 no bed, an\xe2\x80\x99 no fire, I don\xe2\x80\x99 say.\xe2\x80\x99 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 been \xe2\x80\x99shame\xe2\x80\x99 then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the red-faced man, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty square\r\ncase against him, I see. Not only for malicious trespass, but of theft.\r\nSee this bolt?\xe2\x80\x9d producing a piece of iron from his coat pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat gave him away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI en\xe2\x80\x99t no thief!\xe2\x80\x9d blurted Mamouche, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one piece o\xe2\x80\x99\r\niron w\xe2\x80\x99at I pick up in the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor John-Luis with dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cI can understand how the\r\ngrandson of Th\xc3\xa9odule Pelot\xc3\xa9 might be guilty of such mischievous pranks\r\nas this boy has confessed to. But I know that the grandson of St\xc3\xa9phanie\r\nGalopin could not be a thief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he at once wrote out the check for twenty-five dollars, and handed\r\nit to the red-faced man with the tips of his fingers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed very good to Doctor John-Luis to have the boy sitting again at\r\nhis fireside; and so natural, too. He seemed to be the incarnation of\r\nunspoken hopes; the realization of vague and fitful memories of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nWhen Mamouche kept on crying, Doctor John-Luis wiped away the tears with\r\nhis own brown silk handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamouche,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to stay here; to live here with me\r\nalways. To learn how to work; to learn how to study; to grow up to be an\r\nhonorable man. An honorable man, Mamouche, for I want you for my own\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice was pretty low and husky when he said that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not take the key from the door to-*night,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou do not choose to stay and be all this that I say, you may open the\r\ndoor and walk out. I shall use no force to keep you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing, Marsh?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Doctor John-Luis the following morning,\r\nwhen he took the coffee that Marshall had brought to him in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho dat, sah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the boy Mamouche, of course. What is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarshall laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kneelin\xe2\x80\x99 down dah on de flo\xe2\x80\x99. He keep on sayin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Hail, Mary, full\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 grace, de Lord is wid dee. Hail, Mary, full o\xe2\x80\x99 grace\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94t\xe2\x80\x99ree, fo\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntimes, sah.

Dat the\r\noniest way to keep outen mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business is it of yours to interfere?\xe2\x80\x9d broke in Doctor John-Luis,\r\nirritably. \xe2\x80\x9cLet the boy do as his grandmother instructed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t desputin\xe2\x80\x99, sah,\xe2\x80\x9d apologized Marshall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know, Marsh,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the doctor, recovering his usual\r\namiability. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do something with the boy. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\npretty sure of it. For, you see, he has his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; and his\r\ngrandmother was a very intelligent woman; a clever woman, Marsh. Her one\r\ngreat mistake was when she married Th\xc3\xa9odule Pelot\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           A Sentimental Soul\r\n\r\n                           A Sentimental Soul\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nLacodie stayed longer than was his custom in Mamzelle Fleurette\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nstore that evening. He had been tempted by the vapid utterances of a\r\nconservative bellhanger to loudly voice his radical opinions upon the\r\nrights and wrongs of humanity when he finally laid his picayune down\r\nupon Mamzelle Fleurette\xe2\x80\x99s counter and helped himself to _l\xe2\x80\x99Abeille_ from\r\nthe top of the diminished pile of newspapers which stood there.\r\n\r\nHe was small, frail and hollow-chested, but his head was magnificent\r\nwith its generous adornment of waving black hair; its sunken eyes that\r\nglowed darkly and steadily and sometimes flamed, and its moustaches\r\nwhich were formidable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh bien, Mamzelle Fleurette, \xc3\xa0 demain, \xc3\xa0 demain!\xe2\x80\x9d and he waved a\r\nnervous good-bye as he let himself quickly and noiselessly out.\r\n\r\nHowever violent Lacodie might be in his manner toward conservatives, he\r\nwas always gentle, courteous and low-voiced with Mamzelle Fleurette, who\r\nwas much older than he, much taller; who held no opinions, and whom he\r\npitied, and even in a manner revered. Mamzelle Fleurette at once\r\ndismissed the bell-hanger, with whom, on general principles, she had no\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to close the store, for she was going over to the cathedral\r\nto confession. She stayed a moment in the doorway watching Lacodie walk\r\ndown the opposite side of the street. His step was something between a\r\nspring and a jerk, which to her partial eyes seemed the perfection of\r\nmotion. She watched him until he entered his own small low doorway, over\r\nwhich hung a huge wooden key painted red, the emblem of his trade.\r\n\r\nFor many months now, Lacodie had been coming daily to Mamzelle\r\nFleurette\xe2\x80\x99s little notion store to buy the morning paper, which he only\r\nbought and read, however, in the afternoon. Once he had crossed over\r\nwith his box of keys and tools to open a cupboard, which would unlock\r\nfor no inducements of its owner. He would not suffer her to pay him for\r\nthe few moments\xe2\x80\x99 work; it was nothing, he assured her; it was a\r\npleasure; he would not dream of accepting payment for so trifling a\r\nservice from a camarade and fellow-worker. But she need not fear that he\r\nwould lose by it, he told her with a laugh; he would only charge an\r\nextra quarter to the rich lawyer around the corner, or to the top-lofty\r\ndruggist down the street when these might happen to need his services,\r\nas they sometimes did. This was an alternative which seemed far from\r\nright and honest to Mamzelle Fleurette. But she held a vague\r\nunderstanding that men were wickeder in many ways than women; that\r\nungodliness was constitutional with them, like their sex, and\r\ninseparable from it.\r\n\r\nHaving watched Lacodie until he disappeared within his shop, she retired\r\nto her room, back of the store, and began her preparations to go out.\r\nShe brushed carefully the black alpaca skirt, which hung in long nunlike\r\nfolds around her spare figure. She smoothed down the brown, ill-fitting\r\nbasque, and readjusted the old-fashioned, rusty black lace collar which\r\nshe always wore. Her sleek hair was painfully and suspiciously black.\r\nShe powdered her face abundantly with poudre de riz before starting out,\r\nand pinned a dotted black lace veil over her straw bonnet. There was\r\nlittle force or character or anything in her withered face, except a\r\npathetic desire and appeal to be permitted to exist.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette did not walk down Chartres street with her usual\r\ncomposed tread; she seemed preoccupied and agitated. When she passed the\r\nlocksmith\xe2\x80\x99s shop over the way and heard his voice within, she grew\r\ntremulously self-conscious, fingering her veil, swishing the black\r\nalpaca and waving her prayer book about with meaningless intention.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette was in great trouble; trouble which was so bitter, so\r\nsweet, so bewildering, so terrifying! It had come so stealthily upon her\r\nshe had never suspected what it might be. She thought the world was\r\ngrowing brighter and more beautiful; she thought the flowers had\r\nredoubled their sweetness and the birds their song, and that the voices\r\nof her fellow-creatures had grown kinder and their faces truer.\r\n\r\nThe day before Lacodie had not come to her for his paper. At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nhe was not there, at seven he was not there, nor at eight, and then she\r\nknew he would not come. At first, when it was only a little past the\r\ntime of his coming, she had sat strangely disturbed and distressed in\r\nthe rear of the store, with her back to the door. When the door opened\r\nshe turned with fluttering expectancy. It was only an unhappy-looking\r\nchild, who wanted to buy some foolscap, a pencil and an eraser. The next\r\nto come in was an old mulatresse, who was bringing her prayer beads for\r\nMamzelle Fleurette to mend. The next was a gentleman, to buy the Courier\r\ndes Etats Unis, and then a young girl, who wanted a holy picture for her\r\nfavorite nun at the Ursulines; it was everybody but Lacodie.\r\n\r\nA temptation assailed Mamzelle Fleurette, almost fierce in its\r\nintensity, to carry the paper over to his shop herself, when he was not\r\nthere at seven. She conquered it from sheer moral inability to do\r\nanything so daring, so unprecedented. But to-day, when he had come back\r\nand had stayed so long discoursing with the bellhanger, a contentment, a\r\nrapture, had settled upon her being which she could no longer ignore or\r\nmistake. She loved Lacodie. That fact was plain to her now, as plain as\r\nthe conviction that every reason existed why she should not love him. He\r\nwas the husband of another woman. To love the husband of another woman\r\nwas one of the deepest sins which Mamzelle Fleurette knew; murder was\r\nperhaps blacker, but she was not sure. She was going to confession now.\r\nShe was going to tell her sin to Almighty God and Father Fochelle, and\r\nask their forgiveness. She was going to pray and beg the saints and the\r\nHoly Virgin to remove the sweet and subtle poison from her soul. It was\r\nsurely a poison, and a deadly one, which could make her feel that her\r\nyouth had come back and taken her by the hand.\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette had been confessing for many years to old Father\r\nFochelle. In his secret heart he often thought it a waste of his time\r\nand her own that she should come with her little babblings, her little\r\nnothings to him, calling them sins. He felt that a wave of the hand\r\nmight brush them away, and that it in a manner compromised the dignity\r\nof holy absolution to pronounce the act over so innocent a soul.\r\n\r\nTo-day she had whispered all her shortcomings into his ear through the\r\ngrating of the confessional; he knew them so well! There were many other\r\npenitents waiting to be heard, and he was about to dismiss her with a\r\nhasty blessing when she arrested him, and in hesitating, faltering\r\naccents told him of her love for the locksmith, the husband of another\r\nwoman. A slap in the face would not have startled Father Fochelle more\r\nforcibly or more painfully. What soul was there on earth, he wondered,\r\nso hedged about with innocence as to be secure from the machinations of\r\nSatan! Oh, the thunder of indignation that descended upon Mamzelle\r\nFleurette\xe2\x80\x99s head! She bowed down, beaten to earth beneath it. Then came\r\nquestions, one, two, three, in quick succession, that made Mamzelle\r\nFleurette gasp and clutch blindly before her. Why was she not a shadow,\r\na vapor, that she might dissolve from before those angry, penetrating\r\neyes; or a small insect, to creep into some crevice and there hide\r\nherself forevermore?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father! no, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, \xe2\x80\x9che knows nothing, nothing. I\r\nwould die a hundred deaths before he should know, before anyone should\r\nknow, besides yourself and the good God of whom I implore pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather Fochelle breathed more freely, and mopped his face with a flaming\r\nbandana, which he took from the ample pocket of his soutane. But he\r\nscolded Mamzelle Fleurette roundly, unpityingly; for being a fool, for\r\nbeing a sentimentalist. She had not committed mortal sin, but the\r\noccasion was ripe for it; and look to it she must that she keep Satan at\r\nbay with watchfulness and prayer. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, my child, and sin no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette made a d\xc3\xa9tour in regaining her home by which she\r\nwould not have to pass the locksmith\xe2\x80\x99s shop. She did not even look in\r\nthat direction when she let herself in at the glass door of her store.\r\n\r\nSome time before, when she was yet ignorant of the motive which prompted\r\nthe act, she had cut from a newspaper a likeness of Lacodie, who had\r\nserved as foreman of the jury during a prominent murder trial. The\r\nlikeness happened to be good, and quite did justice to the locksmith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfine physiognomy with its leonine hirsute adornment. This picture\r\nMamzelle Fleurette had kept hitherto between the pages of her prayer\r\nbook. Here, twice a day, it looked out at her; as she turned the leaves\r\nof the holy mass in the morning, and when she read her evening devotions\r\nbefore her own little home altar, over which hung a crucifix and a\r\npicture of the Empress Eug\xc3\xa9nie.\r\n\r\nHer first action upon entering her room, even before she unpinned the\r\ndotted veil, was to take Lacodie\xe2\x80\x99s picture from her prayer book and\r\nplace it at random between the leaves of a \xe2\x80\x9cDictionnaire de la Langue\r\nFrancaise,\xe2\x80\x9d which was the undermost of a pile of old books that stood on\r\nthe corner of the mantelpiece. Between night and morning, when she would\r\napproach the holy sacrament, Mamzelle Fleurette felt it to be her duty\r\nto thrust Lacodie from her thoughts by every means and device known to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe following day was Sunday, when there was no occasion or opportunity\r\nfor her to see the locksmith. Moreover, after partaking of holy\r\ncommunion, Mamzelle Fleurette felt invigorated; she was conscious of a\r\nnew, if fictitious, strength to combat Satan and his wiles.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, as the hour approached for Lacodie to appear, Mamzelle\r\nFleurette became harassed by indecision. Should she call in the young\r\ngirl, the neighbor who relieved her on occasion, and deliver the store\r\ninto the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hands for an hour or so? This might be well enough for\r\nonce in a while, but she could not conveniently resort to this\r\nsubterfuge daily. After all, she had her living to make, which\r\nconsideration was paramount. She finally decided that she would retire\r\nto her little back room and when she heard the store door open she would\r\ncall out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Monsieur Lacodie? I am very busy; please take your paper and\r\nleave your cinq sous on the counter.\xe2\x80\x9d If it happened not to be Lacodie\r\nshe would come forward and serve the customer in person. She did not, of\r\ncourse, expect to carry out this performance each day; a fresh device\r\nwould no doubt suggest itself for tomorrow. Mamzelle Fleurette proceeded\r\nto carry out her programme to the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Monsieur Lacodie?\xe2\x80\x9d she called out from the little back room,\r\nwhen the front door opened. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very busy; please take your paper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCe n\xe2\x80\x99est pas Lacodie, Mamzelle Fleurette. C\xe2\x80\x99est moi, Augustine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Lacodie\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a fat, comely young woman, wearing a blue veil\r\nthrown carelessly over her kinky black hair, and carrying some grocery\r\nparcels clasped close in her arms. Mamzelle Fleurette emerged from the\r\nback room, a prey to the most contradictory emotions; relief and\r\ndisappointment struggling for the mastery with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo Lacodie to-day, Mamzelle Fleurette,\xe2\x80\x9d Augustine announced with a\r\ncertain robust ill-humor; \xe2\x80\x9che is there at home shaking with a chill till\r\nthe very window panes rattle. He had one last Friday\xe2\x80\x9d (the day he had\r\nnot come for his paper) \xe2\x80\x9cand now another and a worse one to-day. God\r\nknows, if it keeps on-well, let me have the paper; he will want to read\r\nit to-night when his chill is past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette handed the paper to Augustine, feeling like an old\r\nwoman in a dream handing a newspaper to a young woman in a dream. She\r\nhad never thought of Lacodie having chills or being ill. It seemed very\r\nstrange. And Augustine was no sooner gone than all the ague remedies she\r\nhad ever heard of came crowding to Mamzelle Fleurette\xe2\x80\x99s mind; an egg in\r\nblack coffee\xe2\x80\x94or was it a lemon in black coffee? or an egg in vinegar?\r\nShe rushed to the door to call Augustine back, but the young woman was\r\nalready far down the street.\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\nAugustine did not come the next day, nor the next, for the paper. The\r\nunhappy looking child who had returned for more foolscap, informed\r\nMamzelle Fleurette that he had heard his mother say that Monsieur\r\nLacodie was very sick, and the bellhanger had sat up all night with him.\r\nThe following day Mamzelle Fleurette saw Choppin\xe2\x80\x99s coup\xc3\xa9 pass clattering\r\nover the cobblestones and stop before the locksmith\xe2\x80\x99s door. She knew\r\nthat with her class it was only in a case of extremity that the famous\r\nand expensive physician was summoned. For the first time she thought of\r\ndeath. She prayed all day, silently, to herself, even while waiting upon\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\nIn the evening she took an _Abeille_ from the top of the pile on the\r\ncounter, and throwing a light shawl over her head, started with the\r\npaper over to the locksmith\xe2\x80\x99s shop. She did not know if she were\r\ncommitting a sin in so doing. She would ask Father Fochelle on Saturday,\r\nwhen she went to confession. She did not think it could be a sin; she\r\nwould have called long before on any other sick neighbor, and she\r\nintuitively felt that in this distinction might lie the possibility of\r\nsin.\r\n\r\nThe shop was deserted except for the presence of Lacodie\xe2\x80\x99s little boy of\r\nfive, who sat upon the floor playing with the tools and contrivances\r\nwhich all his days he had coveted, and which all his days had been\r\ndenied to him. Mamzelle Fleurette mounted the narrow stairway in the\r\nrear of the shop which led to an upper landing and then into the room of\r\nthe married couple. She stood a while hesitating upon this landing\r\nbefore venturing to knock softly upon the partly open door through which\r\nshe could hear their voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked apologetically to Augustine, \xe2\x80\x9cthat perhaps\r\nMonsieur Lacodie might like to look at the paper and you had no time to\r\ncome for it, so I brought it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in, Mamzelle Fleurette. It\xe2\x80\x99s Mamzelle Fleurette who comes\r\nto inquire about you, Lacodie,\xe2\x80\x9d Augustine called out loudly to her\r\nhusband, whose half consciousness she somehow confounded with deafness.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette drew mincingly forward, clasping her thin hands\r\ntogether at the waist line, and she peeped timorously at Lacodie lying\r\nlost amid the bedclothes. His black mane was tossed wildly over the\r\npillow and lent a fictitious pallor to the yellow waxiness of his drawn\r\nfeatures. An approaching chill was sending incipient shudders through\r\nhis frame, and making his teeth claque. But he still turned his head\r\ncourteously in Mamzelle Fleurette\xe2\x80\x99s direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBien bon de votre part, Mamzelle Fleurette\xe2\x80\x94mais c\xe2\x80\x99est fini. J\xe2\x80\x99suis\r\nflamb\xc3\xa9, flamb\xc3\xa9, flamb\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, the pain of it! to hear him in such extremity thanking her for her\r\nvisit, assuring her in the same breath that all was over with him. She\r\nwondered how Augustine could hear it so composedly. She whisperingly\r\ninquired if a priest had been summoned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInutile; il n\xe2\x80\x99en veut pas,\xe2\x80\x9d was Augustine\xe2\x80\x99s reply. So he would have no\r\npriest at his bedside, and here was a new weight of bitterness for\r\nMamzelle Fleurette to carry all her days.\r\n\r\nShe flitted back to her store through the darkness, herself like a slim\r\nshadow. The November evening was chill and misty. A dull aureole shot\r\nout from the feeble gas jet at the corner, only faintly and for an\r\ninstant illumining her figure as it glided rapidly and noiselessly along\r\nthe banquette. Mamzelle Fleurette slept little and prayed much that\r\nnight. Saturday morning Lacodie died. On Sunday he was buried and\r\nMamzelle Fleurette did not go to the funeral, because Father Fochelle\r\ntold her plainly she had no business there.\r\n\r\nIt seemed inexpressibly hard to Mamzelle Fleurette that she was not\r\npermitted to hold Lacodie in tender remembrance now that he was dead.\r\nBut Father Fochelle, with his practical insight, made no compromise with\r\nsentimentality; and she did not question his authority, or his ability\r\nto master the subtleties of a situation utterly beyond reach of her own\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer a pleasure for Mamzelle Fleurette to go to confession\r\nas it had formerly been. Her heart went on loving Lacodie and her soul\r\nwent on struggling; for she made this delicate and puzzling distinction\r\nbetween heart and soul, and pictured the two as set in a very death\r\nstruggle against each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help it, father. I try, but I cannot help it. To love him is\r\nlike breathing; I do not know how to help it. I pray, and pray, and it\r\ndoes no good, for half of my prayers are for the repose of his soul. It\r\nsurely cannot be a sin, to pray for the repose of his soul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather Fochelle was heartily sick and tired of Mamzelle Fleurette and\r\nher stupidities. Oftentimes he was tempted to drive her from the\r\nconfessional, and forbid her return until she should have regained a\r\nrational state of mind. But he could not withhold absolution from a\r\npenitent who, week after week, acknowledged her shortcoming and strove\r\nwith all her faculties to overcome it and atone for it.\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\nAugustine had sold out the locksmith\xe2\x80\x99s shop and the business, and had\r\nremoved further down the street over a bakery. Out of her window she had\r\nhung a sign, \xe2\x80\x9cBlanchisseuse de Fin.\xe2\x80\x9d Often, in passing by, Mamzelle\r\nFleurette would catch a glimpse of Augustine up at the window, plying\r\nthe irons; her sleeves rolled to the elbows, baring her round, white\r\narms, and the little black curls all moist and tangled about her face.\r\nIt was early spring then, and there was a languor in the air; an odor of\r\njasmine in every passing breeze; the sky was blue, unfathomable, and\r\nfleecy white; and people along the narrow street laughed, and sang, and\r\ncalled to one another from windows and doorways. Augustine had set a pot\r\nof rose-geranium on her window sill and hung out a bird cage.\r\n\r\nOnce, Mamzelle Fleurette in passing on her way to confession heard her\r\nsinging roulades, vying with the bird in the cage. Another time she saw\r\nthe young woman leaning with half her body from the window, exchanging\r\npleasantries with the baker standing beneath on the banquette.\r\n\r\nStill, a little later, Mamzelle Fleurette began to notice a handsome\r\nyoung fellow often passing the store. He was jaunty and debonnaire and\r\nwore a rich watchchain, and looked prosperous. She knew him quite well\r\nas a fine young Gascon, who kept a stall in the French Market, and from\r\nwhom she had often bought charcuterie. The neighbors told her the young\r\nGascon was paying his addresses to Mme. Lacodie. Mamzelle Fleurette\r\nshuddered. She wondered if Lacodie knew! The whole situation seemed\r\nsuddenly to shift its base, causing Mamzelle Fleurette to stagger. What\r\nground would her poor heart and soul have to do battle upon now?\r\n\r\nShe had not yet had time to adjust her conscience to the altered\r\nconditions when one Saturday afternoon, as she was about to start out to\r\nconfession, she noticed an unusual movement down the street. The\r\nbellhanger, who happened to be presenting himself in the character of a\r\ncustomer, informed her that it was nothing more nor less than Mme.\r\nLacodie returning from her wedding with the Gascon. He was black and\r\nbitter with indignation, and thought she might at least have waited for\r\nthe year to be out. But the charivari was already on foot; and Mamzelle\r\nneed not feel alarmed if, in the night, she heard sounds and clamor to\r\nrouse the dead as far away as Metairie ridge.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette sank down in a chair, trembling in all her members.\r\nShe faintly begged the bellhanger to pour her a glass of water from the\r\nstone pitcher behind the counter. She fanned herself and loosened her\r\nbonnet strings. She sent the bell hanger away.\r\n\r\nShe nervously pulled off her rusty black kid gloves, and ten times more\r\nnervously drew them on again. To a little customer, who came in for\r\nchewing gum, she handed a paper of pins.\r\n\r\nThere was a great, a terrible upheaval taking place in Mamzelle\r\nFleurette\xe2\x80\x99s soul. She was preparing for the first time in her life to\r\ntake her conscience into her own keeping.\r\n\r\nWhen she felt herself sufficiently composed to appear decently upon the\r\nstreet, she started out to confession. She did not go to Father\r\nFochelle. She did not even go to the Cathedral; but to a church which\r\nwas much farther away, and to reach which she had to spend a picayune\r\nfor car fare.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette confessed herself to a priest who was utterly new and\r\nstrange to her. She told him all her little venial sins, which she had\r\nmuch difficulty in bringing to a number of any dignity and importance\r\nwhatever. Not once did she mention her love for Lacodie, the dead\r\nhusband of another woman.\r\n\r\nMamzelle Fleurette did not ride back to her home; she walked. The\r\nsensation of walking on air was altogether delicious; she had never\r\nexperienced it before. A long time she stood contemplative before a shop\r\nwindow in which were displayed wreaths, mottoes, emblems, designed for\r\nthe embellishment of tombstones. What a sweet comfort it would be, she\r\nreflected, on the 1st of November to carry some such delicate offering\r\nto Lacodie\xe2\x80\x99s last resting place. Might not the sole care of his tomb\r\ndevolve upon her, after all! The possibility thrilled her and moved her\r\nto the heart. What thought would the merry Augustine and her\r\nlover-husband have for the dead lying in cemeteries!\r\n\r\nWhen Mamzelle Fleurette reached home she went through the store directly\r\ninto her little back room. The first thing which she did, even before\r\nunpinning the dotted lace veil, was to take the \xe2\x80\x9cDictionnaire de La\r\nLangue Francaise\xe2\x80\x9d from beneath the pile of old books on the mantelpiece.\r\nIt was not easy to find Lacodie\xe2\x80\x99s picture hidden somewhere in its\r\ndepths. But the search afforded her almost a sensuous pleasure; turning\r\nthe leaves slowly back and forth.\r\n\r\nWhen she had secured the likeness she went into the store and from her\r\nshowcase selected a picture frame\xe2\x80\x94the very handsomest there; one of\r\nthose which sold for thirty-five cents.\r\n\r\nInto the frame Mamzelle Fleurette neatly and deftly pasted Lacodie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npicture. Then she re-entered her room and deliberately hung it upon the\r\nwall\xe2\x80\x94between the crucifix and the portrait of Empress Eug\xc3\xa8nie\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\ndid not care if the Gascon\xe2\x80\x99s wife ever saw it or not.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            Dead Men\xe2\x80\x99s Shoes\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            Dead Men\xe2\x80\x99s Shoes\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to any person to wonder what would befall Gilma now\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cle vieux Gamiche\xe2\x80\x9d was dead. After the burial people went their\r\nseveral ways, some to talk over the old man and his eccentricities,\r\nothers to forget him before nightfall, and others to wonder what would\r\nbecome of his very nice property, the hundred-acre farm on which he had\r\nlived for thirty years, and on which he had just died at the age of\r\nseventy.\r\n\r\nIf Gilma had been a child, more than one motherly heart would have gone\r\nout to him. This one and that one would have bethought them of carrying\r\nhim home with them; to concern themselves with his present comfort, if\r\nnot his future welfare. But Gilma was not a child. He was a strapping\r\nfellow of nineteen, measuring six feet in his stockings, and as strong\r\nas any healthy youth need be. For ten years he had lived there on the\r\nplantation with Monsieur Gamiche; and he seemed now to have been the\r\nonly one with tears to shed at the old man\xe2\x80\x99s funeral.\r\n\r\nGamiche\xe2\x80\x99s relatives had come down from Caddo in a wagon the day after\r\nhis death, and had settled themselves in his house. There was Septime,\r\nhis nephew, a cripple, so horribly afflicted that it was distressing to\r\nlook at him. And there was Septime\xe2\x80\x99s widowed sister, Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Broz\xc3\xa9, with\r\nher two little girls. They had remained at the house during the burial,\r\nand Gilma found them still there upon his return.\r\n\r\nThe young man went at once to his room to seek a moment\xe2\x80\x99s repose. He had\r\nlost much sleep during Monsieur Gamiche\xe2\x80\x99s illness; yet, he was in fact\r\nmore worn by the mental than the bodily strain of the past week.\r\n\r\nBut when he entered his room, there was something so changed in its\r\naspect that it seemed no longer to belong to him. In place of his own\r\napparel which he had left hanging on the row of pegs, there were a few\r\nshabby little garments and two battered straw hats, the property of the\r\nBroz\xc3\xa9 children. The bureau drawers were empty, there was not a vestige\r\nof anything belonging to him remaining in the room. His first impression\r\nwas that Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Broz\xc3\xa9 had been changing things around and had assigned\r\nhim to some other room.\r\n\r\nBut Gilma understood the situation better when he discovered every scrap\r\nof his personal effects piled up on a bench outside the door, on the\r\nback or \xe2\x80\x9cfalse\xe2\x80\x9d gallery. His boots and shoes were under the bench, while\r\ncoats, trousers and underwear were heaped in an indiscriminate mass\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe blood mounted to his swarthy face and made him look for the moment\r\nlike an Indian. He had never thought of this. He did not know what he\r\nhad been thinking of; but he felt that he ought to have been prepared\r\nfor anything; and it was his own fault if he was not. But it hurt. This\r\nspot was \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d to him against the rest of the world. Every tree, every\r\nshrub was a friend; he knew every patch in the fences; and the little\r\nold house, gray and weather-beaten, that had been the shelter of his\r\nyouth, he loved as only few can love inanimate things. A great enmity\r\narose in him against Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Broz\xc3\xa9. She was walking about the yard, with\r\nher nose in the air, and a shabby black dress trailing behind her. She\r\nheld the little girls by the hand.\r\n\r\nGilma could think of nothing better to do than to mount his horse and\r\nride away\xe2\x80\x94anywhere. The horse was a spirited animal of great value.\r\nMonsieur Gamiche had named him \xe2\x80\x9cJupiter\xe2\x80\x9d on account of his proud\r\nbearing, and Gilma had nicknamed him \xe2\x80\x9cJupe,\xe2\x80\x9d which seemed to him more\r\nendearing and expressive of his great attachment to the fine creature.\r\nWith the bitter resentment of youth, he felt that \xe2\x80\x9cJupe\xe2\x80\x9d was the only\r\nfriend remaining to him on earth.\r\n\r\nHe had thrust a few pieces of clothing in his saddlebags and had\r\nrequested Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Broz\xc3\xa9, with assumed indifference, to put his remaining\r\neffects in a place of safety until he should be able to send for them.\r\n\r\nAs he rode around by the front of the house, Septime, who sat on the\r\ngallery all doubled up in his uncle Gamiche\xe2\x80\x99s big chair, called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xa9, Gilma! w\xe2\x80\x99ere you boun\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 away,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gilma, curtly, reining his horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right; but I reckon you might jus\xe2\x80\x99 as well leave that hoss\r\nbehine you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hoss is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Gilma, as quickly as he would have returned\r\na blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see \xe2\x80\x99bout that li\xe2\x80\x99le later, my frien\xe2\x80\x99. I reckon you jus\xe2\x80\x99 well\r\nturn \xe2\x80\x99im loose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGilma had no more intention of giving up his horse than he had of\r\nparting with his own right hand. But Monsieur Gamiche had taught him\r\nprudence and respect for the law. He did not wish to invite disagreeable\r\ncomplications. So, controlling his temper by a supreme effort, Gilma\r\ndismounted, unsaddled the horse then and there, and led it back to the\r\nstable. But as he started to leave the place on foot, he stopped to say\r\nto Septime:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Mr. Septime, that hoss is mine; I can collec\xe2\x80\x99 a hundred\r\naff\xe2\x80\x99davits to prove it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring them yere in a few days with a\r\nstatement f\xe2\x80\x99om a lawyer; an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll expec\xe2\x80\x99 the hoss an\xe2\x80\x99 saddle to be\r\nturned over to me in good condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see \xe2\x80\x99bout that. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you stay fo\xe2\x80\x99 dinna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thank you, sah; Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Broz\xc3\xa9 already ask\xe2\x80\x99 me.\xe2\x80\x9d And Gilma strode\r\naway, down the beaten footpath that led across the sloping grassplot\r\ntoward the outer road.\r\n\r\nA definite destination and a settled purpose ahead of him seemed to have\r\nrevived his flagging energies of an hour before. It was with no trace of\r\nfatigue that he stepped out bravely along the wagon-road that skirted\r\nthe bayou.\r\n\r\nIt was early spring, and the cotton had already a good stand. In some\r\nplaces the negroes were hoeing. Gilma stopped alongside the rail fence\r\nand called to an old negress who was plying her hoe at no great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Aunt Hal\xe2\x80\x99fax! see yere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned, and immediately quitted her work to go and join him,\r\nbringing her hoe with her across her shoulder. She was large-boned and\r\nvery black. She was dressed in the deshabille of the field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come up to yo\xe2\x80\x99 cabin with me a minute, Aunt Hally,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get an aff\xe2\x80\x99davit f\xe2\x80\x99om you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe understood, after a fashion, what an affidavit was; but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee the good of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no aff\xe2\x80\x99davis, boy; you g\xe2\x80\x99long an\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99 pesta me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twon\xe2\x80\x99t take you any time, Aunt Hal\xe2\x80\x99fax. I jus\xe2\x80\x99 want you to put yo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmark to a statement I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to write to the effec\xe2\x80\x99 that my hoss, Jupe,\r\nis my own prop\xe2\x80\x99ty; that you know it, an\xe2\x80\x99 willin\xe2\x80\x99 to swear to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho say Jupe don\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99long to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned cautiously, leaning on\r\nher hoe.\r\n\r\nHe motioned toward the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Mista Septime and them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I reckon!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d Gilma went on; \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 nex\xe2\x80\x99 thing they\xe2\x80\x99ll be sayin\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99 ole\r\nmule, Policy, don\xe2\x80\x99t b\xe2\x80\x99long to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody. But I say, nex\xe2\x80\x99 thing, that\xe2\x80\x99 w\xe2\x80\x99at they\xe2\x80\x99ll be sayin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to move along the inside of the fence, and he turned to keep\r\npace with her, walking on the grassy edge of the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll jus\xe2\x80\x99 write the aff\xe2\x80\x99davit, Aunt Hally, an\xe2\x80\x99 all you got to do\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know des well as me dat mule mine. I done paid ole Mista Gamiche\r\nfo\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99im in good cotton; dat year you falled outen de puckhorn tree; an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe write it down hisse\xe2\x80\x99f in his \xe2\x80\x99count book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGilma did not linger a moment after obtaining the desired statement from\r\nAunt Halifax. With the first of those \xe2\x80\x9chundred affidavits\xe2\x80\x9d that he hoped\r\nto secure, safe in his pocket, he struck out across the country, seeking\r\nthe shortest way to town.\r\n\r\nAunt Halifax stayed in the cabin door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Relius,\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted to a little black boy out in the road, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes you\r\nsee Pol\xe2\x80\x99cy anywhar? G\xe2\x80\x99long, see ef he \xe2\x80\x99roun\xe2\x80\x99 de ben\xe2\x80\x99.

He had had no difficulty in obtaining the testimony of\r\nblacks and whites regarding his ownership of the horse; but he wanted to\r\nmake his claim as secure as possible by consulting the lawyer and\r\nreturning to the plantation armed with unassailable evidence.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office was a plain little room opening upon the street.\r\nNobody was there, but the door was open; and Gilma entered and took a\r\nseat at the bare round table and waited. It was not long before the\r\nlawyer came in; he had been in conversation with some one across the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Mr. Pax\xe2\x80\x99on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gilma, rising.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer knew his face well enough, but could not place him, and only\r\nreturned: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, sir\xe2\x80\x94good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d began Gilma plunging at once into business, and\r\ndrawing his handful of nondescript affidavits from his pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cabout a\r\nmatter of prope\xe2\x80\x99ty, about regaining possession of my hoss that Mr.\r\nSeptime, ole Mr. Gamiche\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, is holdin\xe2\x80\x99 f\xe2\x80\x99om me yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer took the papers and, adjusting his eye-glasses, began to look\r\nthem through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince Mr. Gamiche died on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94began Gilma.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGamiche died!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Lawyer Paxton, with astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell me that vieux Gamiche is dead? Well, well. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nheard of it; I just returned from Shreveport this morning. So le vieux\r\nGamiche is dead, is he? And you say you want to get possession of a\r\nhorse. What did you say your name was?\xe2\x80\x9d drawing a pencil from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilma Germain is my name, suh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilma Germain,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the lawyer, a little meditatively, scanning\r\nhis visitor closely. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I recall your face now. You are the young\r\nfellow whom le vieux Gamiche took to live with him some ten or twelve\r\nyears ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen years ago las\xe2\x80\x99 November, suh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawyer Paxton arose and went to his safe, from which, after unlocking\r\nit, he took a legal-looking document that he proceeded to read carefully\r\nthrough to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Germain, I reckon there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any trouble about regaining\r\npossession of the horse,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Lawyer Paxton. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to inform\r\nyou, my dear sir, that our old friend, Gamiche, has made you sole heir\r\nto his property; that is, his plantation, including live stock, farming\r\nimplements, machinery, household effects, etc. Quite a pretty piece of\r\nproperty,\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed leisurely, seating himself comfortably for a\r\nlong talk. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I may add, a pretty piece of luck, Mr. Germain, for a\r\nyoung fellow just starting out in life; nothing but to step into a dead\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s shoes! A great chance\xe2\x80\x94great chance. Do you know, sir, the moment\r\nyou mentioned your name, it came back to me like a flash, how le vieux\r\nGamiche came in here one day, about three years ago, and wanted to make\r\nhis will\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 And the loquacious lawyer went on with his reminiscences and\r\ninteresting bits of information, of which Gilma heard scarcely a word.\r\n\r\nHe was stunned, drunk, with the sudden joy of possession; the thought of\r\nwhat seemed to him great wealth, all his own\xe2\x80\x94his own! It seemed as if a\r\nhundred different sensations were holding him at once, and as if a\r\nthousand intentions crowded upon him. He felt like another being who\r\nwould have to readjust himself to the new conditions, presenting\r\nthemselves so unexpectedly. The narrow confines of the office were\r\nstifling, and it seemed as if the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s flow of talk would never\r\nstop. Gilma arose abruptly, and with a half-uttered apology, plunged\r\nfrom the room into the outer air.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Gilma stopped again before Aunt Halifax\xe2\x80\x99s cabin, on his\r\nway back to the plantation. He was walking as before, having declined to\r\navail himself of any one of the several offers of a mount that had been\r\ntendered him in town and on the way. A rumor of Gilma\xe2\x80\x99s great good\r\nfortune had preceded him, and Aunt Halifax greeted him with an almost\r\ntriumphal shout as he approached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows you desarve it, Mista Gilma! De Lord knows you does, suh!\r\nCome in an\xe2\x80\x99 res\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99se\xe2\x80\x99f, suh. You, \xe2\x80\x99Relius! git out dis heah cabin;\r\ncrowdin\xe2\x80\x99 up dat away!\xe2\x80\x9d She wiped off the best chair available and\r\noffered it to Gilma.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to rest himself and glad to accept Aunt Halifax\xe2\x80\x99s proffer of\r\na cup of coffee, which she was in the act of dripping before a small\r\nfire. He sat as far as he could from the fire, for the day was warm; he\r\nmopped his face, and fanned himself with his broad-rimmed hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI des\xe2\x80\x99 can\xe2\x80\x99t he\xe2\x80\x99p laughin\xe2\x80\x99 w\xe2\x80\x99en I thinks \xe2\x80\x99bout it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman,\r\nfairly shaking, as she leaned over the hearth. \xe2\x80\x9cI wakes up in de night,\r\neven, an\xe2\x80\x99 has to laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that, Aunt Hal\xe2\x80\x99fax,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gilma, almost tempted to laugh himself\r\nat he knew not what.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x99long, Mista Gilma! like you don\xe2\x80\x99 know! It\xe2\x80\x99s w\xe2\x80\x99en I thinks \xe2\x80\x99bout\r\nSeptime an\xe2\x80\x99 them like I gwine see \xe2\x80\x99em in dat wagon to-mor\xe2\x80\x99 mo\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99, on\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndey way back to Caddo. Oh, lawsy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99 so ver\xe2\x80\x99 funny, Aunt Hal\xe2\x80\x99fax,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Gilma, feeling himself\r\nill at ease as he accepted the cup of coffee which she presented to him\r\nwith much ceremony on a platter. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel pretty sorry for Septime,\r\nmyse\xe2\x80\x99f.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon he know now who Jupe b\xe2\x80\x99long to,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, ignoring his\r\nexpression of sympathy; \xe2\x80\x9cno need to tell him who Pol\xe2\x80\x99cy b\xe2\x80\x99long to,\r\nnuther. An\xe2\x80\x99 I tell you, Mista Gilma,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, leaning upon the\r\ntable without seating herself, \xe2\x80\x9cdey gwine back to hard times in Caddo. I\r\nheah tell dey nuva gits \xe2\x80\x99nough to eat, yonda. Septime, he can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nnuttin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99cep\xe2\x80\x99 set still all twis\xe2\x80\x99 up like a sarpint. An\xe2\x80\x99 Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Broz\xc3\xa9,\r\nshe do some kine sewin\xe2\x80\x99; but don\xe2\x80\x99t look like she got sense \xe2\x80\x99nough to do\r\ndat halfway. An\xe2\x80\x99 dem li\xe2\x80\x99le gals, dey \xe2\x80\x99bleege to run bar\xe2\x80\x99foot mos\xe2\x80\x99 all\r\nlas\xe2\x80\x99 winta\xe2\x80\x99, twell dat li\xe2\x80\x99les\xe2\x80\x99 gal, she got her heel plum fros\xe2\x80\x99 bit, so\r\ndey tells me. Oh, lawsy! How dey gwine look to-mor\xe2\x80\x99, all trapsin\xe2\x80\x99 back\r\nto Caddo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGilma had never found Aunt Halifax\xe2\x80\x99s company so intensely disagreeable\r\nas at that moment. He thanked her for the coffee, and went away so\r\nsuddenly as to startle her. But her good humor never flagged. She called\r\nout to him from the doorway:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mista Gilma! You reckon dey knows who Pol\xe2\x80\x99cy b\xe2\x80\x99longs to now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe somehow did not feel quite prepared to face Septime; and he lingered\r\nalong the road. He even stopped a while to rest, apparently, under the\r\nshade of a huge cottonwood tree that overhung the bayou. From the very\r\nfirst, a subtle uneasiness, a self-dissatisfaction had mingled with his\r\nelation, and he was trying to discover what it meant.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the straightforwardness of his own nature had inwardly\r\nresented the sudden change in the bearing of most people toward himself.\r\nHe was trying to recall, too, something which the lawyer had said; a\r\nlittle phrase, out of that multitude of words, that had fallen in his\r\nconsciousness. It had stayed there, generating a little festering sore\r\nplace that was beginning to make itself irritatingly felt. What was it,\r\nthat little phrase? Something about\xe2\x80\x94in his excitement he had only half\r\nheard it\xe2\x80\x94something about dead men\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.\r\n\r\nThe exuberant health and strength of his big body; the courage,\r\nvirility, endurance of his whole nature revolted against the expression\r\nin itself, and the meaning which it conveyed to him. Dead men\xe2\x80\x99s shoes!\r\nWere they not for such afflicted beings as Septime? as that helpless,\r\ndependent woman up there? as those two little ones, with their poorly\r\nfed, poorly clad bodies and sweet, appealing eyes? Yet he could not\r\ndetermine how he would act and what he would say to them.\r\n\r\nBut there was no room left in his heart for hesitancy when he came to\r\nface the group. Septime was still crouched in his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s chair; he\r\nseemed never to have left it since the day of the funeral. Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Broz\xc3\xa9\r\nhad been crying, and so had the children\xe2\x80\x94out of sympathy, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Septime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gilma, approaching, \xe2\x80\x9cI brought those aff\xe2\x80\x99davits\r\nabout the hoss. I hope you about made up yo\xe2\x80\x99 mind to turn it over\r\nwithout further trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeptime was trembling, bewildered, almost speechless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWat you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered, looking up with a shifting, sideward\r\nglance. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole place b\xe2\x80\x99longs to you. You tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to make a fool out\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFo\xe2\x80\x99 me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Gilma, \xe2\x80\x9cthe place can stay with Mr. Gamiche\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nflesh an\xe2\x80\x99 blood. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see Mr. Pax\xe2\x80\x99on again an\xe2\x80\x99 make that according to\r\nthe law. But I want my hoss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGilma took something besides his horse\xe2\x80\x94a picture of le vieux Gamiche,\r\nwhich had stood on his mantelpiece. He thrust it into his pocket. He\r\nalso took his old benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s walking-stick and a gun.\r\n\r\nAs he rode out of the gate, mounted upon his well-beloved \xe2\x80\x9cJupe,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nfaithful dog following, Gilma felt as if he had awakened from an\r\nintoxicating but depressing dream.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          At Cheni\xc3\xa8re Caminada\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          At Ch\xc3\xaaniere Caminada\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nThere was no clumsier looking fellow in church that Sunday morning than\r\nAntoine Bocaze\xe2\x80\x94the one they called Tonie. But Tonie did not really care\r\nif he were clumsy or not. He felt that he could speak intelligibly to no\r\nwoman save his mother; but since he had no desire to inflame the hearts\r\nof any of the island maidens, what difference did it make?\r\n\r\nHe knew there was no better fisherman on the Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada than\r\nhimself, if his face was too long and bronzed, his limbs too\r\nunmanageable and his eyes too earnest\xe2\x80\x94almost too honest.\r\n\r\nIt was a midsummer day, with a lazy, scorching breeze blowing from the\r\nGulf straight into the church windows. The ribbons on the young girls\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhats fluttered like the wings of birds, and the old women clutched the\r\nflapping ends of the veils that covered their heads.\r\n\r\nA few mosquitoes, floating through the blistering air, with their\r\nnipping and humming fretted the people to a certain degree of attention\r\nand consequent devotion. The measured tones of the priest at the altar\r\nrose and fell like a song: \xe2\x80\x9cCredo in unum Deum patrem omnipotentem\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nchanted. And then the people all looked at one another, suddenly\r\nelectrified.\r\n\r\nSome one was playing upon the organ whose notes no one on the whole\r\nisland was able to awaken; whose tones had not been heard during the\r\nmany months since a passing stranger had one day listlessly dragged his\r\nfingers across its idle keys. A long, sweet strain of music floated down\r\nfrom the loft and filled the church.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to most of them\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to Tonie standing there beside his\r\nold mother\xe2\x80\x94that some heavenly being must have descended upon the Church\r\nof Our Lady of Lourdes and chosen this celestial way of communicating\r\nwith its people.\r\n\r\nBut it was no creature from a different sphere; it was only a young lady\r\nfrom Grand Isle. A rather pretty young person with blue eyes and\r\nnut-brown hair, who wore a dotted lawn of fine texture and fashionable\r\nmake, and a white Leghorn sailor-hat.\r\n\r\nTonie saw her standing outside of the church after mass, receiving the\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s voluble praises and thanks for her graceful service.\r\n\r\nShe had come over to mass from Grand Isle in Baptiste Beaudelet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlugger, with a couple of young men, and two ladies who kept a pension\r\nover there. Tonie knew these two ladies\xe2\x80\x94the widow Lebrun and her old\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94but he did not attempt to speak with them; he would not have\r\nknown what to say. He stood aside gazing at the group, as others were\r\ndoing, his serious eyes fixed earnestly upon the fair organist.\r\n\r\nTonie was late at dinner that day. His mother must have waited an hour\r\nfor him, sitting patiently with her coarse hands folded in her lap, in\r\nthat little still room with its \xe2\x80\x9cbrick-painted\xe2\x80\x9d floor, its gaping\r\nchimney and homely furnishings.\r\n\r\nHe told her that he had been walking\xe2\x80\x94walking he hardly knew where, and\r\nhe did not know why. He must have tramped from one end of the island to\r\nthe other; but he brought her no bit of news or gossip. He did not know\r\nif the Cotures had stopped for dinner with the Avendettes; whether old\r\nPierre Fran\xc3\xa7ois was worse, or better, or dead, or if lame Philibert was\r\ndrinking again this morning. He knew nothing; yet he had crossed the\r\nvillage, and passed every one of its small houses that stood close\r\ntogether in a long, jagged line facing the sea; they were gray and\r\nbattered by time and the rude buffets of the salt sea winds.\r\n\r\nHe knew nothing, though the Cotures had all bade him \xe2\x80\x9cgood day\xe2\x80\x9d as they\r\nfiled into Avendette\xe2\x80\x99s, where a steaming plate of crab gumbo was waiting\r\nfor each. He had heard some woman screaming, and others saying it was\r\nbecause old Pierre Fran\xc3\xa7ois had just passed away. But he did not\r\nremember this, nor did he recall the fact that lame Philibert had\r\nstaggered against him when he stood absently watching a \xe2\x80\x9cfiddler\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsidling across the sun-baked sand. He could tell his mother nothing of\r\nall this; but he said he had noticed that the wind was fair and must\r\nhave driven Baptiste\xe2\x80\x99s boat, like a flying bird, across the water.\r\n\r\nWell, that was something to talk about, and old Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Antoine, who was\r\nfat, leaned comfortably upon the table after she had helped Tonie to his\r\ncourtbouillon, and remarked that she found Madame was getting old. Tonie\r\nthought that perhaps she was aging and her hair was getting whiter. He\r\nseemed glad to talk about her, and reminded his mother of old Madame\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkindness and sympathy at the time his father and brothers had perished.\r\nIt was when he was a little fellow, ten years before, during a squall in\r\nBarataria Bay.\r\n\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99me Antoine declared that she could never forget that sympathy, if she\r\nlived till Judgment Day; but all the same she was sorry to see that\r\nMadame Lebrun was also not so young or fresh as she used to be. Her\r\nchances of getting a husband were surely lessening every year;\r\nespecially with the young girls around her, budding each spring like\r\nflowers to be plucked. The one who had played upon the organ was\r\nMademoiselle Duvign\xc3\xa9, Claire Duvign\xc3\xa9, a great belle, the daughter of the\r\nRampart street. Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Antoine had found that out during the ten minutes\r\nshe and others had stopped after mass to gossip with the priest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClaire Duvign\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Tonie, not even making a pretense to taste\r\nhis courtbouillon, but picking little bits from the half loaf of crusty\r\nbrown bread that lay beside his plate. \xe2\x80\x9cClaire Duvign\xc3\xa9; that is a pretty\r\nname. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, mother? I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anyone on the\r\nCh\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re who has so pretty a one, nor at Grand Isle, either, for that\r\nmatter. And you say she lives on Rampart street?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared to him a matter of great importance that he should have his\r\nmother repeat all that the priest had told her.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning Tonie went out in search of lame Philibert,\r\nthan whom there was no cleverer workman on the island when he could be\r\ncaught sober.\r\n\r\nTonie had tried to work on his big lugger that lay bottom upward under\r\nthe shed, but it had seemed impossible. His mind, his hands, his tools\r\nrefused to do their office, and in sudden desperation he desisted. He\r\nfound Philibert and set him to work in his own place under the shed.\r\nThen he got into his small boat with the red lateen-sail and went over\r\nto Grand Isle.\r\n\r\nThere was no one at hand to warn Tonie that he was acting the part of a\r\nfool. He had, singularly, never felt those premonitory symptoms of love\r\nwhich afflict the greater portion of mankind before they reach the age\r\nwhich he had attained. He did not at first recognize this powerful\r\nimpulse that had, without warning, possessed itself of his entire being.\r\nHe obeyed it without a struggle, as naturally as he would have obeyed\r\nthe dictates of hunger and thirst.\r\n\r\nTonie left his boat at the wharf and proceeded at once to Mme. Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npension, which consisted of a group of plain, stoutly built cottages\r\nthat stood in mid island, about half a mile from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe day was bright and beautiful with soft, velvety gusts of wind\r\nblowing from the water. From a cluster of orange trees a flock of doves\r\nascended, and Tonie stopped to listen to the beating of their wings and\r\nfollow their flight toward the water oaks whither he himself was moving.\r\n\r\nHe walked with a dragging, uncertain step through the yellow, fragrant\r\nchamomile, his thoughts traveling before him. In his mind was always the\r\nvivid picture of the girl as it had stamped itself there yesterday,\r\nconnected in some mystical way with that celestial music which had\r\nthrilled him and was vibrating yet in his soul.\r\n\r\nBut she did not look the same to-day. She was returning from the beach\r\nwhen Tonie first saw her, leaning upon the arm of one of the men who had\r\naccompanied her yesterday. She was dressed differently\xe2\x80\x94in a dainty blue\r\ncotton gown. Her companion held a big white sunshade over them both.\r\nThey had exchanged hats and were laughing with great abandonment.\r\n\r\nTwo young men walked behind them and were trying to engage her\r\nattention. She glanced at Tonie, who was leaning against a tree when the\r\ngroup passed by; but of course she did not know him. She was speaking\r\nEnglish, a language which he hardly understood.\r\n\r\nThere were other young people gathered under the water oaks\xe2\x80\x94girls who\r\nwere, many of them, more beautiful than Mlle. Duvign\xc3\xa9; but for Tonie\r\nthey simply did not exist. His whole universe had suddenly become\r\nconverted into a glamorous background for the person of Mlle. Duvign\xc3\xa9,\r\nand the shadowy figures of men who were about her.\r\n\r\nTonie went to Mme. Lebrun and told her he would bring her oranges next\r\nday from the Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re. She was well pleased, and commissioned him to\r\nbring her other things from the stores there, which she could not\r\nprocure at Grand Isle. She did not question his presence, knowing that\r\nthese summer days were idle ones for the Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re fishermen. Nor did she\r\nseem surprised when he told her that his boat was at the wharf, and\r\nwould be there every day at her service. She knew his frugal habits, and\r\nsupposed he wished to hire it, as others did. He intuitively felt that\r\nthis could be the only way.\r\n\r\nAnd that is how it happened that Tonie spent so little of his time at\r\nthe Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada that summer. Old Ma\xe2\x80\x99me Antoine grumbled enough\r\nabout it. She herself had been twice in her life to Grand Isle and once\r\nto Grand Terre, and each time had been more than glad to get back to the\r\nCh\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re. And why Tonie should want to spend his days, and even his\r\nnights, away from home, was a thing she could not comprehend, especially\r\nas he would have to be away the whole winter; and meantime there was\r\nmuch work to be done at his own hearthside and in the company of his own\r\nmother. She did not know that Tonie had much, much more to do at Grand\r\nIsle than at the Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada.\r\n\r\nHe had to see how Claire Duvign\xc3\xa9 sat upon the gallery in the big rocking\r\nchair that she kept in motion by the impetus of her slender, slippered\r\nfoot; turning her head this way and that way to speak to the men who\r\nwere always near her. He had to follow her lithe motions at tennis or\r\ncroquet, that she often played with the children under the trees. Some\r\ndays he wanted to see how she spread her bare, white arms, and walked\r\nout to meet the foam-*crested waves. Even here there were men with her.\r\nAnd then at night, standing alone like a still shadow under the stars,\r\ndid he not have to listen to her voice when she talked and laughed and\r\nsang? Did he not have to follow her slim figure whirling through the\r\ndance, in the arms of men who must have loved her and wanted her as he\r\ndid. He did not dream that they could help it more than he could help\r\nit. But the days when she stepped into his boat, the one with the red\r\nlateen sail, and sat for hours within a few feet of him, were days that\r\nhe would have given up for nothing else that he could think of.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThere were always others in her company at such times, young people with\r\njests and laughter on their lips. Only once she was alone.\r\n\r\nShe had foolishly brought a book with her, thinking she would want to\r\nread. But with the breath of the sea stinging her she could not read a\r\nline. She looked precisely as she had looked the day he first saw her,\r\nstanding outside of the church at Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada.\r\n\r\nShe laid the book down in her lap, and let her soft eyes sweep dreamily\r\nalong the line of the horizon where the sky and water met. Then she\r\nlooked straight at Tonie, and for the first time spoke directly to him.\r\n\r\nShe called him Tonie, as she had heard others do, and questioned him\r\nabout his boat and his work. He trembled, and answered her vaguely and\r\nstupidly. She did not mind, but spoke to him anyhow, satisfied to talk\r\nherself when she found that he could not or would not. She spoke French,\r\nand talked about the Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada, its people and its church. She\r\ntalked of the day she had played upon the organ there, and complained of\r\nthe instrument being woefully out of tune.\r\n\r\nTonie was perfectly at home in the familiar task of guiding his boat\r\nbefore the wind that bellied its taut, red sail. He did not seem clumsy\r\nand awkward as when he sat in church. The girl noticed that he appeared\r\nas strong as an ox.\r\n\r\nAs she looked at him and surprised one of his shifting glances, a\r\nglimmer of the truth began to dawn faintly upon her. She remembered how\r\nshe had encountered him daily in her path, with his earnest, devouring\r\neyes always seeking her out. She recalled\xe2\x80\x94but there was no need to\r\nrecall anything. There are women whose perception of passion is very\r\nkeen; they are the women who most inspire it.\r\n\r\nA feeling of complacency took possession of her with this conviction.\r\nThere was some softness and sympathy mingled with it. She would have\r\nliked to lean over and pat his big, brown hand, and tell him she felt\r\nsorry and would have helped it if she could. With this belief he ceased\r\nto be an object of complete indifference in her eyes. She had thought,\r\nawhile before, of having him turn about and take her back home. But now\r\nit was really piquant to pose for an hour longer before a man\xe2\x80\x94even a\r\nrough fisherman\xe2\x80\x94to whom she felt herself to be an object of silent and\r\nconsuming devotion. She could think of nothing more interesting to do on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nShe was incapable of conceiving the full force and extent of his\r\ninfatuation. She did not dream that under the rude, calm exterior before\r\nher a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart was beating clamorously, and his reason yielding to\r\nthe savage instinct of his blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear the Angelus ringing at Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re, Tonie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow it was so late; let us go back to the island.\xe2\x80\x9d There had been a\r\nlong silence which her musical voice interrupted.\r\n\r\nTonie could now faintly hear the Angelus bell himself. A vision of the\r\nchurch came with it, the odor of incense and the sound of the organ. The\r\ngirl before him was again that celestial being whom our Lady of Lourdes\r\nhad once offered to his immortal vision.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dusk when they landed at the pier, and frogs had begun to\r\ncroak among the reeds in the pools. There were two of Mlle. Duvign\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nusual attendants anxiously awaiting her return. But she chose to let\r\nTonie assist her out of the boat. The touch of her hand fired his blood\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nShe said to him very low and half-laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no money tonight,\r\nTonie; take this instead,\xe2\x80\x9d pressing into his palm a delicate silver\r\nchain, which she had worn twined about her bare wrist. It was purely a\r\nspirit of coquetry that prompted the action, and a touch of the\r\nsentimentality which most women possess. She had read in some romance of\r\na young girl doing something like that.\r\n\r\nAs she walked away between her two attendants she fancied Tonie pressing\r\nthe chain to his lips. But he was standing quite still, and held it\r\nburied in his tightly-closed hand; wanting to hold as long as he might\r\nthe warmth of the body that still penetrated the bauble when she thrust\r\nit into his hand.\r\n\r\nHe watched her retreating figure like a blotch against the fading sky.\r\nHe was stirred by a terrible, an overmastering regret, that he had not\r\nclasped her in his arms when they were out there alone, and sprung with\r\nher into the sea. It was what he had vaguely meant to do when the sound\r\nof the Angelus had weakened and palsied his resolution. Now she was\r\ngoing from him, fading away into the mist with those figures on either\r\nside of her, leaving him alone. He resolved, within himself that if ever\r\nagain she were out there on the sea at his mercy, she would have to\r\nperish in his arms. He would go far, far out where the sound of no bell\r\ncould reach him. There was some comfort for him in the thought.\r\n\r\nBut as it happened, Mlle. Duvign\xc3\xa9 never went out alone in the boat with\r\nTonie again.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIt was one morning in January. Tonie had been collecting a bill from one\r\nof the fishmongers at the French Market, in New Orleans, and had turned\r\nhis steps toward St. Philip street. The day was chilly; a keen wind was\r\nblowing. Tonie mechanically buttoned his rough, warm coat and crossed\r\nover into the sun.\r\n\r\nThere was perhaps not a more wretched-hearted being in the whole\r\ndistrict, that morning, than he. For months the woman he so hopelessly\r\nloved had been lost to his sight. But all the more she dwelt in his\r\nthoughts, preying upon his mental and bodily forces until his unhappy\r\ncondition became apparent to all who knew him. Before leaving his home\r\nfor the winter fishing grounds he had opened his whole heart to his\r\nmother, and told her of the trouble that was killing him. She hardly\r\nexpected that he would ever come back to her when he went away. She\r\nfeared that he would not, for he had spoken wildly of the rest and peace\r\nthat could only come to him with death.\r\n\r\nThat morning when Tonie had crossed St. Philip street he found himself\r\naccosted by Madame Lebrun and her mother. He had not noticed them\r\napproaching, and, moreover, their figures in winter garb appeared\r\nunfamiliar to him. He had never seen them elsewhere than at Grand Isle\r\nand the Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re during the summer. They were glad to meet him, and\r\nshook his hand cordially. He stood as usual a little helplessly before\r\nthem. A pulse in his throat was beating and almost choking him, so\r\npoignant were the recollections which their presence stirred up.\r\n\r\nThey were staying in the city this winter, they told him. They wanted to\r\nhear the opera as often as possible, and the island was really too\r\ndreary with everyone gone. Madame Lebrun had left her son there to keep\r\norder and superintend repairs, and so on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are both well?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Tonie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn perfect health, my dear Tonie,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Lebrun replied. She was\r\nwondering at his haggard eyes and thin, gaunt cheeks; but possessed too\r\nmuch tact to mention them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94the young lady who used to go sailing\xe2\x80\x94is she well?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired\r\nlamely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean Mlle. Favette? She was married just after leaving Grand Isle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I mean the one you called Claire\xe2\x80\x94Mamzelle Duvign\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x94is she well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMother and daughter exclaimed together: \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible! You haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard?\r\nWhy, Tonie,\xe2\x80\x9d madame continued, \xe2\x80\x9cMlle. Duvign\xc3\xa9 died three weeks ago. But\r\nthat was something sad, I tell you!... Her family heartbroken.... Simply\r\nfrom a cold caught by standing in thin slippers, waiting for her\r\ncarriage after the opera.... What a warning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two were talking at once. Tonie kept looking from one to the other.\r\nHe did not know what they were saying, after madame had told him, \xe2\x80\x9cElle\r\nest morte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs in a dream he finally heard that they said good-by to him, and sent\r\ntheir love to his mother.\r\n\r\nHe stood still in the middle of the banquette when they had left him,\r\nwatching them go toward the market. He could not stir. Something had\r\nhappened to him\xe2\x80\x94he did not know what. He wondered if the news was\r\nkilling him.\r\n\r\nSome women passed by, laughing coarsely. He noticed how they laughed and\r\ntossed their heads. A mockingbird was singing in a cage which hung from\r\na window above his head. He had not heard it before.\r\n\r\nJust beneath the window was the entrance to a barroom. Tonie turned and\r\nplunged through its swinging doors. He asked the bartender for whisky.\r\nThe man thought he was already drunk, but pushed the bottle toward him\r\nnevertheless. Tonie poured a great quantity of the fiery liquor into a\r\nglass and swallowed it at a draught. The rest of the day he spent among\r\nthe fishermen and Barataria oystermen; and that night he slept soundly\r\nand peacefully until morning.\r\n\r\nHe did not know why it was so; he could not understand. But from that\r\nday he felt that he began to live again, to be once more a part of the\r\nmoving world about him. He would ask himself over and over again why it\r\nwas so, and stay bewildered before this truth that he could not answer\r\nor explain, and which he began to accept as a holy mystery.\r\n\r\nOne day in early spring Tonie sat with his mother upon a piece of\r\ndrift-wood close to the sea.\r\n\r\nHe had returned that day to the Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada. At first she thought\r\nhe was like his former self again, for all his old strength and courage\r\nhad returned. But she found that there was a new brightness in his face\r\nwhich had not been there before. It made her think of the Holy Ghost\r\ndescending and bringing some kind of light to a man.\r\n\r\nShe knew that Mademoiselle Duvign\xc3\xa9 was dead, and all along had feared\r\nthat this knowledge would be the death of Tonie. When she saw him come\r\nback to her like a new being, at once she dreaded that he did not know.\r\nAll day the doubt had been fretting her, and she could bear the\r\nuncertainty no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Tonie\xe2\x80\x94that young lady whom you cared for\xe2\x80\x94well, some one read\r\nit to me in the papers\xe2\x80\x94she died last winter.\xe2\x80\x9d She had tried to speak as\r\ncautiously as she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know she is dead. I am glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time he had said this in words, and it made his heart\r\nbeat quicker.\r\n\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99me Antoine shuddered and drew aside from him. To her it was somehow\r\nlike murder to say such a thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Why are you glad?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, indignantly.\r\n\r\nTonie was sitting with his elbows on his knees. He wanted to answer his\r\nmother, but it would take time; he would have to think. He looked out\r\nacross the water that glistened gem-like with the sun upon it, but there\r\nwas nothing there to open his thought. He looked down into his open palm\r\nand began to pick at the callous flesh that was hard as a horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoof.\r\nWhilst he did this his ideas began to gather and take form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, while she lived I could never hope for anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he began,\r\nslowly feeling his way. \xe2\x80\x9cDespair was the only thing for me. There were\r\nalways men about her. She walked and sang and danced with them. I knew\r\nit all the time, even when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her. But I saw her often enough.\r\nI knew that some day one of them would please her and she would give\r\nherself to him\xe2\x80\x94she would marry him. That thought haunted me like an evil\r\nspirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTonie passed his hand across his forehead as if to sweep away anything\r\nof the horror that might have remained there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt kept me awake at night,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that was not so bad; the\r\nworst torture was to sleep, for then I would dream that it was all true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I could see her married to one of them\xe2\x80\x94his wife\xe2\x80\x94coming year after\r\nyear to Grand Isle and bringing her little children with her! I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell you all that I saw\xe2\x80\x94all that was driving me mad! But now\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Tonie\r\nclasped his hands together and smiled as he looked again across the\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe is where she belongs; there is no difference up there; the\r\ncur\xc3\xa9 has often told us there is no difference between men. It is with\r\nthe soul that we approach each other there. Then she will know who has\r\nloved her best. That is why I am so contented. Who knows what may happen\r\nup there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99me Antoine could not answer. She only took her son\xe2\x80\x99s big, rough hand\r\nand pressed it against her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, ma m\xc3\xa8re,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, cheerfully, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go light\r\nthe fire for your bread; it is a long time since I have done anything\r\nfor you,\xe2\x80\x9d and he stooped and pressed a warm kiss on her withered old\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nWith misty eyes she watched him walk away in the direction of the big\r\nbrick oven that stood open-mouthed under the lemon trees.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           Odalie Misses Mass\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           Odalie Misses Mass\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nOdalie sprang down from the mule-cart, shook out her white skirts, and\r\nfirmly grasping her parasol, which was blue to correspond with her sash,\r\nentered Aunt Pinky\xe2\x80\x99s gate and proceeded towards the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s cabin.\r\nShe was a thick-waisted young thing who walked with a firm tread and\r\ncarried her head with a determined poise. Her straight brown hair had\r\nbeen rolled up over night in papillotes, and the artificial curls stood\r\nout in clusters, stiff and uncompromising beneath the rim of her white\r\nchip hat. Her mother, sister and brother remained seated in the cart\r\nbefore the gate.\r\n\r\nIt was the fifteenth of August, the great feast of the Assumption, so\r\ngenerally observed in the Catholic parishes of Louisiana. The Chotard\r\nfamily were on their way to mass, and Odalie had insisted upon stopping\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cshow herself\xe2\x80\x9d to her old friend and proteg\xc3\xa9e, Aunt Pinky.\r\n\r\nThe helpless, shrivelled old negress sat in the depths of a large,\r\nrudely-fashioned chair. A loosely hanging unbleached cotton gown\r\nenveloped her mite of a figure. What was visible of her hair beneath the\r\nbandana turban, looked like white sheep\xe2\x80\x99s wool. She wore round,\r\nsilver-rimmed spectacles, which gave her an air of wisdom and\r\nrespectability, and she held in her hand the branch of a hickory\r\nsapling, with which she kept mosquitoes and flies at bay, and even\r\nchickens and pigs that sometimes penetrated the heart of her domain.\r\n\r\nOdalie walked straight up to the old woman and kissed her on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Aunt Pinky, yere I am,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced with evident\r\nself-complacency, turning herself slowly and stiffly around like a\r\nmechanical dummy. In one hand she held her prayer-book, fan and\r\nhandkerchief, in the other the blue parasol, still open; and on her\r\nplump hands were blue cotton mitts. Aunt Pinky beamed and chuckled;\r\nOdalie hardly expected her to be able to do more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you saw me,\xe2\x80\x9d the child continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you satisfied. I mus\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngo; I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got a minute to was\xe2\x80\x99e.\xe2\x80\x9d But at the threshold she turned to\r\ninquire, bluntly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99ere\xe2\x80\x99s Pug?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPug,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aunt Pinky, in her tremulous old-woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone to chu\xe2\x80\x99ch; done gone; she done gone,\xe2\x80\x9d nodding her head in seeming\r\napproval of Pug\xe2\x80\x99s action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo church!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Odalie with a look of consternation settling in her\r\nround eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gone to chu\xe2\x80\x99ch,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Aunt Pinky. \xe2\x80\x9cSay she kain\xe2\x80\x99t miss chu\xe2\x80\x99ch\r\non de fifteent\xe2\x80\x99; de debble gwine pester her twell jedgment, she miss\r\nchu\xe2\x80\x99ch on de fifteent\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOdalie\xe2\x80\x99s plump cheeks fairly quivered with indignation and she stamped\r\nher foot. She looked up and down the long, dusty road that skirted the\r\nriver. Nothing was to be seen save the blue cart with its dejected\r\nlooking mule and patient occupants. She walked to the end of the gallery\r\nand called out to a negro boy whose black bullet-head showed up in bold\r\nrelief against the white of the cotton patch:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, Baptiste! w\xe2\x80\x99ere\xe2\x80\x99s yo\xe2\x80\x99 ma? Ask yo\xe2\x80\x99 ma if she can\xe2\x80\x99t come set with\r\nAunt Pinky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMammy, she gone to chu\xe2\x80\x99ch,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Baptiste in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBont\xc3\xa9! w\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s taken you all darkies with yo\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98church\xe2\x80\x99 to-day? You come\r\nalong yere Baptiste an\xe2\x80\x99 set with Aunt Pinky. That Pug! I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to make\r\nyo\xe2\x80\x99 ma wear her out fo\xe2\x80\x99 that trick of hers\xe2\x80\x94leavin\xe2\x80\x99 Aunt Pinky like\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at the first intimation of what was wanted of him, Baptiste dipped\r\nbelow the cotton like a fish beneath water, leaving no sight nor sound\r\nof himself to answer Odalie\xe2\x80\x99s repeated calls. Her mother and sister were\r\nbeginning to show signs of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, I can\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out to them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nobody to stay with Aunt\r\nPinky. I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave Aunt Pinky like that, to fall out of her chair,\r\nmaybe, like she already fell out once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou goin\xe2\x80\x99 to miss mass on the fifteenth, you, Odalie! W\xe2\x80\x99at you thinkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d came in shrill rebuke from her sister. But her mother offering\r\nno objection, the boy lost not a moment in starting the mule forward at\r\na brisk trot. She watched them disappear in a cloud of dust; and turning\r\nwith a dejected, almost tearful countenance, re-entered the room.\r\n\r\nAunt Pinky seemed to accept her reappearance as a matter of course; and\r\neven evinced no surprise at seeing her remove her hat and mitts, which\r\nshe laid carefully, almost religiously, on the bed, together with her\r\nbook, fan and handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThen Odalie went and seated herself some distance from the old woman in\r\nher own small, low rocking-chair. She rocked herself furiously, making a\r\ngreat clatter with the rockers over the wide, uneven boards of the cabin\r\nfloor; and she looked out through the open door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPuggy, she done gone to chu\xe2\x80\x99ch; done gone. Say de debble gwine pester\r\nher twell jedgment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou done tole me that, Aunt Pinky; neva mine; don\xe2\x80\x99t le\xe2\x80\x99s talk about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Pinky thus rebuked, settled back into silence and Odalie continued\r\nto rock and stare out of the door.\r\n\r\nOnce she arose, and taking the hickory branch from Aunt Pinky\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnerveless hand, made a bold and sudden charge upon a little pig that\r\nseemed bent upon keeping her company. She pursued him with flying heels\r\nand loud cries as far as the road. She came back flushed and breathless\r\nand her curls hanging rather limp around her face; she began again to\r\nrock herself and gaze silently out of the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gwine make yo\xe2\x80\x99 fus\xe2\x80\x99 c\xe2\x80\x99mmunion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemingly sober inquiry on the part of Aunt Pinky at once shattered\r\nOdalie\xe2\x80\x99s ill-humor and dispelled every shadow of it. She leaned back and\r\nlaughed with wild abandonment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais w\xe2\x80\x99at you thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 about, Aunt Pinky? How you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember I made\r\nmy firs\xe2\x80\x99 communion las\xe2\x80\x99 year, with this same dress w\xe2\x80\x99at maman let out\r\nthe tuck,\xe2\x80\x9d holding up the altered skirt for Aunt Pinky\xe2\x80\x99s inspection.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 with this same petticoat w\xe2\x80\x99at maman added this ruffle an\xe2\x80\x99 crochet\xe2\x80\x99\r\nedge; excep\xe2\x80\x99 I had a w\xe2\x80\x99ite sash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese evidences proved beyond question convincing and seemed to satisfy\r\nAunt Pinky. Odalie rocked as furiously as ever, but she sang now, and\r\nthe swaying chair had worked its way nearer to the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gwine git mar\xe2\x80\x99ied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, Aunt Pinky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Odalie, when she had ceased laughing and\r\nwas wiping her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cI declare, sometime\xe2\x80\x99 I think you gittin\xe2\x80\x99 plumb\r\nfoolish. How you expec\xe2\x80\x99 me to git married w\xe2\x80\x99en I\xe2\x80\x99m on\xe2\x80\x99y thirteen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvidently Aunt Pinky did not know why or how she expected anything so\r\npreposterous; Odalie\xe2\x80\x99s holiday attire that filled her with contemplative\r\nrapture, had doubtless incited her to these vagaries.\r\n\r\nThe child now drew her chair quite close to the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s knee after\r\nshe had gone out to the rear of the cabin to get herself some water and\r\nhad brought a drink to Aunt Pinky in the gourd dipper.\r\n\r\nThere was a strong, hot breeze blowing from the river, and it swept\r\nfitfully and in gusts through the cabin, bringing with it the weedy\r\nsmell of cacti that grew thick on the bank, and occasionally a shower of\r\nreddish dust from the road. Odalie for a while was greatly occupied in\r\nkeeping in place her filmy skirt, which every gust of wind swelled\r\nballoon-like about her knees. Aunt Pinky\xe2\x80\x99s little black, scrawny hand\r\nhad found its way among the droopy curls, and strayed often caressingly\r\nto the child\xe2\x80\x99s plump neck and shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou riclics, honey, dat day yo\xe2\x80\x99 granpappy say it wur pinchin\xe2\x80\x99 times an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe reckin he bleege to sell Yallah Tom an\xe2\x80\x99 Susan an\xe2\x80\x99 Pinky?

You riclics dat, honey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOdalie had grown accustomed to these flights of fancy on the part of her\r\nold friend; she liked to humor her as she chose to sometimes humor very\r\nsmall children; so she was quite used to impersonating one dearly\r\nbeloved but impetuous, \xe2\x80\x9cPaulette,\xe2\x80\x9d who seemed to have held her place in\r\nold Pinky\xe2\x80\x99s heart and imagination through all the years of her suffering\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rec\xe2\x80\x99lec\xe2\x80\x99 like it was yesterday, Aunt Pinky.

I can see all that jus\xe2\x80\x99 as plain!\xe2\x80\x9d responded\r\nOdalie sympathetically, yet in truth she took but a languid interest in\r\nthese reminiscences which she had listened to so often before.\r\n\r\nShe leaned her flushed cheek against Aunt Pinky\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\r\n\r\nThe air was rippling now, and hot and caressing. There was the hum of\r\nbumble bees outside; and busy mud-daubers kept flying in and out through\r\nthe door. Some chickens had penetrated to the very threshold in their\r\naimless roamings, and the little pig was approaching more cautiously.\r\nSleep was fast overtaking the child, but she could still hear through\r\nher drowsiness the familiar tones of Aunt Pinky\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Hi\xe2\x80\x99um, he done gone; he nuva come back; an\xe2\x80\x99 Yallah Tom nuva come\r\nback; an\xe2\x80\x99 ole Marster an\xe2\x80\x99 de chillun\xe2\x80\x94all gone\xe2\x80\x94nuva come back.

Aunt Pinky was asleep with her head leaning back\r\non her chair and her fingers thrust into the mass of tangled brown hair\r\nthat swept across her lap. The chickens and little pig walked fearlessly\r\nin and out. The sunlight crept close up to the cabin door and stole away\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOdalie awoke with a start. Her mother was standing over her arousing her\r\nfrom sleep. She sprang up and rubbed her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I been asleep!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed. The cart was standing in the road waiting. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 Aunt Pinky,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s asleep, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ch\xc3\xa9rie, Aunt Pinky is asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her mother, leading Odalie\r\naway. But she spoke low and trod softly as gentle-souled women do, in\r\nthe presence of the dead.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               Cavanelle\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               Cavanelle\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nI was always sure of hearing something pleasant from Cavanelle across\r\nthe counter. If he was not mistaking me for the freshest and prettiest\r\ngirl in New Orleans, he was reserving for me some bit of silk, or lace,\r\nor ribbon of a nuance marvelously suited to my complexion, my eyes or my\r\nhair! What an innocent, delightful humbug Cavanelle was! How well I knew\r\nit and how little I cared! For when he had sold me the confection or bit\r\nof dry-goods in question, he always began to talk to me of his sister\r\nMathilde, and then I knew that Cavanelle was an angel.\r\n\r\nI had known him long enough to know why he worked so faithfully, so\r\nenergetically and without rest\xe2\x80\x94it was because Mathilde had a voice. It\r\nwas because of her voice that his coats were worn till they were out of\r\nfashion and almost out at elbows. But for a sister whose voice needed\r\nonly a little training to rival that of the nightingale, one might do\r\nsuch things without incurring reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will believe, madame, that I did not know you las\xe2\x80\x99 night at the\r\nopera? I remark\xe2\x80\x99 to Mathilde, \xe2\x80\x98tiens! Mademoiselle Montreville,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nonly rec\xe2\x80\x99nize my mistake when I finally adjust my opera glass.... I\r\nguarantee you will be satisfied, madame. In a year from now you will\r\ncome an\xe2\x80\x99 thank me for having secu\xe2\x80\x99 you that bargain in a\r\npoult-desoie.... Yes, yes; as you say, Tolville was in voice. But,\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\na shrug of the narrow shoulders and a smile of commiseration that\r\nwrinkled the lean olive cheeks beneath the thin beard, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to hear that\r\ncavatina render\xe2\x80\x99 as I have heard it render\xe2\x80\x99 by Mathilde, is another\r\naffair! A quality, madame, that moves, that penetrates. Perhaps not yet\r\nenough volume, but that will accomplish itself with time, when she will\r\nbecome more robus\xe2\x80\x99 in health. It is my intention to sen\xe2\x80\x99 her for the\r\nsummer to Gran\xe2\x80\x99 Isle; that good air an\xe2\x80\x99 surf bathing will work miracles.\r\nAn artiste, voyez vous, it is not to be treated like a human being of\r\nevery day; it needs des petits soins; perfec\xe2\x80\x99 res\xe2\x80\x99 of body an\xe2\x80\x99 mind;\r\ngood red wine an\xe2\x80\x99 plenty ... oh yes, madame, the stage; that is our\r\nintention; but never with my consent in light opera. Patience is what I\r\ncounsel to Mathilde. A little more stren\xe2\x80\x99th; a little dev\xe2\x80\x99lopment of the\r\nchest to give that soup\xc3\xa7on of compass which is lacking, an\xe2\x80\x99 gran\xe2\x80\x99 opera\r\nis what I aspire for my sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was curious to know Mathilde and to hear her sing; and thought it a\r\ngreat pity that a voice so marvelous as she doubtless possessed should\r\nnot gain the notice that might prove the step toward the attainment of\r\nher ambition. It was such curiosity and a half-formed design or desire\r\nto interest myself in her career that prompted me to inform Cavanelle\r\nthat I should greatly like to meet his sister; and I asked permission to\r\ncall upon her the following Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nCavanelle was charmed. He otherwise would not have been Cavanelle. Over\r\nand over I was given the most minute directions for finding the house.\r\nThe green car\xe2\x80\x94or was it the yellow or blue one? I can no longer\r\nremember. But it was near Goodchildren street, and would I kindly walk\r\nthis way and turn that way? At the corner was an ice dealer\xe2\x80\x99s. In the\r\nmiddle of the block, their house\xe2\x80\x94one-story; painted yellow; a knocker; a\r\nbanana tree nodding over the side fence. But indeed, I need not look for\r\nthe banana tree, the knocker, the number or anything, for if I but turn\r\nthe corner in the neighborhood of five o\xe2\x80\x99clock I would find him planted\r\nat the door awaiting me.\r\n\r\nAnd there he was! Cavanelle himself; but seeming to me not himself;\r\napart from the entourage with which I was accustomed to associate him.\r\nEvery line of his mobile face, every gesture emphasized the welcome\r\nwhich his kind eyes expressed as he ushered me into the small parlor\r\nthat opened upon the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not that chair, madame! I entreat you. This one, by all means.\r\nThousan\xe2\x80\x99 times more comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMathilde! Strange; my sister was here but an instant ago. Mathilde! O\xc3\xb9\r\nes tu donc?\xe2\x80\x9d Stupid Cavanelle! He did not know when I had already\r\nguessed it\xe2\x80\x94that Mathilde had retired to the adjoining room at my\r\napproach, and would appear after a sufficient delay to give an\r\nappropriate air of ceremony to our meeting.\r\n\r\nAnd what a frail little piece of mortality she was when she did appear!\r\nAt beholding her I could easily fancy that when she stepped outside of\r\nthe yellow house, the zephyrs would lift her from her feet and, given a\r\nproper adjustment of the balloon sleeves, gently waft her in the\r\ndirection of Goodchildren street, or wherever else she might want to go.\r\n\r\nHers was no physique for grand opera\xe2\x80\x94certainly no stage presence;\r\napparently so slender a hold upon life that the least tension might snap\r\nit. The voice which could hope to overcome these glaring disadvantages\r\nwould have to be phenomenal.\r\n\r\nMathilde spoke English imperfectly, and with embarrassment, and was glad\r\nto lapse into French. Her speech was languid, unaffectedly so; and her\r\nmanner was one of indolent repose; in this respect offering a striking\r\ncontrast to that of her brother. Cavanelle seemed unable to rest. Hardly\r\nwas I seated to his satisfaction than he darted from the room and soon\r\nreturned followed by a limping old black woman bringing in a sirop\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99orgeat and layer cake on a tray.\r\n\r\nMathilde\xe2\x80\x99s face showed feeble annoyance at her brother\xe2\x80\x99s want of savoir\r\nvivre in thus introducing the refreshments at so early a stage of my\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nThe servant was one of those cheap black women who abound in the French\r\nquarter, who speak Creole patois in preference to English, and who would\r\nrather work in a petit m\xc3\xa9nage in Goodchildren street for five dollars a\r\nmonth than for fifteen in the fourth district. Her presence, in some\r\nunaccountable manner, seemed to reveal to me much of the inner working\r\nof this small household. I pictured her early morning visit to the\r\nFrench market, where picayunes were doled out sparingly, and lagniappes\r\ngathered in with avidity.\r\n\r\nI could see the neatly appointed dinner table; Cavanelle extolling his\r\nsoup and bouillie in extravagant terms; Mathilde toying with her\r\npapabotte or chicken-wing, and pouring herself a demi-verre from her\r\nvery own half-bottle of St. Julien; Pouponne, as they called her,\r\nmumbling and grumbling through habit, and serving them as faithfully as\r\na dog through instinct. I wondered if they knew that Pouponne \xe2\x80\x9cplayed\r\nthe lottery\xe2\x80\x9d with every spare \xe2\x80\x9cquarter\xe2\x80\x9d gathered from a judicious\r\nmanagement of lagniappe. Perhaps they would not have cared, or have\r\nminded, either, that she as often consulted the Voudoo priestess around\r\nthe corner as her father confessor.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts had followed Pouponne\xe2\x80\x99s limping figure from the room, and it\r\nwas with an effort I returned to Cavanelle twirling the piano stool this\r\nway and that way. Mathilde was languidly turning over musical scores,\r\nand the two warmly discussing the merits of a selection which she had\r\nevidently decided upon.\r\n\r\nThe girl seated herself at the piano. Her hands were thin and an\xc3\xa6mic,\r\nand she touched the keys without firmness or delicacy. When she had\r\nplayed a few introductory bars, she began to sing. Heaven only knows\r\nwhat she sang; it made no difference then, nor can it make any now.\r\n\r\nThe day was a warm one, but that did not prevent a creepy chilliness\r\nseizing hold of me. The feeling was generated by disappointment, anger,\r\ndismay and various other disagreeable sensations which I cannot find\r\nnames for. Had I been intentionally deceived and misled? Was this some\r\nimpertinent pleasantry on the part of Cavanelle? Or rather had not the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s voice undergone some hideous transformation since her brother had\r\nlistened to it? I dreaded to look at him, fearing to see horror and\r\nastonishment depicted on his face. When I did look, his expression was\r\nearnestly attentive and beamed approval of the strains to which he\r\nmeasured time by a slow, satisfied motion of the hand.\r\n\r\nThe voice was thin to attenuation, I fear it was not even true. Perhaps\r\nmy disappointment exaggerated its simple deficiencies into monstrous\r\ndefects. But it was an unsympathetic voice that never could have been a\r\nblessing to possess or to listen to.\r\n\r\nI cannot recall what I said at parting\xe2\x80\x94doubtless conventional things\r\nwhich were not true. Cavanelle politely escorted me to the car, and\r\nthere I left him with a hand-clasp which from my side was tender with\r\nsympathy and pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Cavanelle! poor Cavanelle!\xe2\x80\x9d The words kept beating time in my\r\nbrain to the jingle of the car bells and the regular ring of the mules\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhoofs upon the cobble stones. One moment I resolved to have a talk with\r\nhim in which I would endeavor to open his eyes to the folly of thus\r\ncasting his hopes and the substance of his labor to the winds. The next\r\ninstant I had decided that chance would possibly attend to Cavanelle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffair less clumsily than I could. \xe2\x80\x9cBut all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d I wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nCavanelle a fool? is he a lunatic? is he under a hypnotic spell?\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94strange that I did not think of it before\xe2\x80\x94I realized that Cavanelle\r\nloved Mathilde intensely, and we all know that love is blind, but a god\r\njust the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years passed before I saw Cavanelle again. I had been absent that\r\nlength of time from the city. In the meanwhile Mathilde had died. She\r\nand her little voice\xe2\x80\x94the apotheosis of insignificance\xe2\x80\x94were no more. It\r\nwas perhaps a year after my visit to her that I read an account of her\r\ndeath in a New Orleans paper. Then came a momentary pang of\r\ncommiseration for my good Cavanelle. Chance had surely acted here the\r\npart of a skillful though merciless surgeon; no temporizing, no half\r\nmeasures. A deep, sharp thrust of the scalpel; a moment of agonizing\r\npain; then rest, rest; convalescence; health; happiness! Yes, Mathilde\r\nhad been dead a year and I was prepared for great changes in Cavanelle.\r\n\r\nHe had lived like a hampered child who does not recognize the\r\nrestrictions hedging it about, and lives a life of pathetic contentment\r\nin the midst of them. But now all that was altered. He was, doubtless,\r\nregaling himself with the half-bottles of St. Julien, which were never\r\nbefore for him; with, perhaps, an occasional petit souper at Moreau\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand there was no telling what little pleasures beside.\r\n\r\nCavanelle would certainly have bought himself a suit of clothes or two\r\nof modern fit and finish. I would find him with a brightened eye, a\r\nfuller cheek, as became a man of his years; perchance, even, a waxed\r\nmoustache! So did my imagination run rampant with me.\r\n\r\nAnd after all, the hand which I clasped across the counter was that of\r\nthe self-same Cavanelle I had left. It was no fuller, no firmer. There\r\nwere even some additional lines visible through the thin, brown beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my poor Cavanelle! you have suffered a grievous loss since we\r\nparted.\xe2\x80\x9d I saw in his face that he remembered the circumstances of our\r\nlast meeting, so there was no use in avoiding the subject. I had rightly\r\nconjectured that the wound had been a cruel one, but in a year such\r\nwounds heal with a healthy soul.\r\n\r\nHe could have talked for hours of Mathilde\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy taking-off, and if\r\nthe subject had possessed for me the same touching fascination which it\r\nheld for him, doubtless, we would have done so, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is it now, mon ami? Are you living in the same place? running\r\nyour little m\xc3\xa9nage as before, my poor Cavanelle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, madame, except that my Aunt F\xc3\xa9licie is making her home with me\r\nnow. You have heard me speak of my aunt\xe2\x80\x94No? You never have heard me\r\nspeak of my Aunt F\xc3\xa9licie Cavanelle of Terrebonne! That, madame, is a\r\nnoble woman who has suffer\xe2\x80\x99 the mos\xe2\x80\x99 cruel affliction, and deprivation,\r\nsince the war.\xe2\x80\x94No, madame, not in good health, unfortunately, by any\r\nmeans. It is why I esteem that a blessed privilege to give her declining\r\nyears those little comforts, ces petits soins, that is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nto expec\xe2\x80\x99 from men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew what \xe2\x80\x9cdes petits soins\xe2\x80\x9d meant with Cavanelle; doctors\xe2\x80\x99 visits,\r\nlittle jaunts across the lake, friandises of every description showered\r\nupon \xe2\x80\x9cAunt F\xc3\xa9licie,\xe2\x80\x9d and he himself relegated to the soup and bouillie\r\nwhich typified his prosaic existence.\r\n\r\nI was unreasonably exasperated with the man for awhile, and would not\r\neven permit myself to notice the beauty in texture and design of the\r\nmousseline de laine which he had spread across the counter in tempting\r\nfolds. I was forced to restrain a brutal desire to say something\r\nstinging and cruel to him for his fatuity.\r\n\r\nHowever, before I had regained the street, the conviction that Cavanelle\r\nwas a hopeless fool seemed to reconcile me to the situation and also\r\nafforded me some diversion.\r\n\r\nBut even this estimate of my poor Cavanelle was destined not to last. By\r\nthe time I had seated myself in the Prytania street car and passed up my\r\nnickel, I was convinced that Cavanelle was an angel.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt happened just as every one had predicted. Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette was\r\nbeside herself with rage and indignation when she learned that the town\r\nauthorities had for some reason condemned her house and intended to\r\ndemolish it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat house w\xe2\x80\x99at Vieumaite gi\xe2\x80\x99 me his own se\xe2\x80\x99f, out his own mout\xe2\x80\x99, w\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nhe gi\xe2\x80\x99 me my freedom!

Bon dieu\r\nSeigneur, w\xe2\x80\x99at dey talkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette stood in the doorway of her home, resting a gaunt\r\nblack hand against the jamb. In the other hand she held her corn-cob\r\npipe. She was a tall, large-boned woman of a pronounced Congo type. The\r\nhouse in question had been substantial enough in its time. It contained\r\nfour rooms: the lower two of brick, the upper ones of adobe. A\r\ndilapidated gallery projected from the upper story and slanted over the\r\nnarrow banquette, to the peril of passers-by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever heard why the property was given to you in the\r\nfirst place, Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Lawyer Paxton, who had stopped\r\nin passing, as so many others did, to talk the matter over with the old\r\nnegress. The affair was attracting some attention in town, and its\r\ndevelopment was being watched with a good deal of interest. Tante\r\nCat\xe2\x80\x99rinette asked nothing better than to satisfy the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVieumaite all time say.

Fine wedda fo\xe2\x80\x99 dry my close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nUpon the gallery above hung an array of shirts, which gleamed white in\r\nthe sunshine, and flapped in the rippling breeze.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette defying the authorities was one which\r\noffered much diversion to the children of the neighborhood. They played\r\nnumberless pranks at her expense; daily serving upon her fictitious\r\nnotices purporting to be to the last degree official. One youngster, in\r\na moment of inspiration, composed a couplet, which they recited, sang,\r\nshouted at all hours, beneath her windows.\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette, she go in town;\r\n               Wen she come back, her house pull\xe2\x80\x99 down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo ran the production. She heard it many times during the day, but, far\r\nfrom offending her, she accepted it as a warning,\xe2\x80\x94a prediction, as it\r\nwere,\xe2\x80\x94and she took heed not to offer to fate the conditions for its\r\nfulfillment. She no longer quitted her house even for a moment, so great\r\nwas her fear and so firm her belief that the town authorities were lying\r\nin wait to possess themselves of it. She would not cross the street to\r\nvisit a neighbor. She waylaid passers-by and pressed them into service\r\nto do her errands and small shopping. She grew distrustful and\r\nsuspicious, ever on the alert to scent a plot in the most innocent\r\nendeavor to induce her to leave the house.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette was hanging out her latest batch of\r\nwashing, Eus\xc3\xa8be, a \xe2\x80\x9cfree mulatto\xe2\x80\x9d from Red River, stopped his pony\r\nbeneath her gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xa9, Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette!\xe2\x80\x9d he called up to her.\r\n\r\nShe turned to the railing just as she was, in her bare arms and neck\r\nthat gleamed ebony-like against the unbleached cotton of her chemise. A\r\ncoarse skirt was fastened about her waist, and a string of many-colored\r\nbeads knotted around her throat. She held her smoking pipe between her\r\nyellow teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you all come on, Mich\xc3\xa9 Eus\xc3\xa8be?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned, pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all middlin\xe2\x80\x99, Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette. But Miss Kitty, she putty bad off\r\nout yon\xe2\x80\x99a. I see Mista Raymond dis mo\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99 w\xe2\x80\x99en I pass by his house; he\r\nsay look like de feva don\xe2\x80\x99 wan\xe2\x80\x99 to quit \xe2\x80\x99er. She been axen\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99 you all\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99rough de night. He \xe2\x80\x99low he reckon I betta tell you. Nice wedda we got\r\nfo\xe2\x80\x99 plantin\xe2\x80\x99, Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice wedda fo\xe2\x80\x99 lies, Mich\xc3\xa9 Eus\xc3\xa8be,\xe2\x80\x9d and she spat contemptuously down\r\nupon the banquette. She turned away without noticing the man further,\r\nand proceeded to hang one of Lawyer Paxton\xe2\x80\x99s fine linen shirts upon the\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe been axen\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99 you all t\xe2\x80\x99rough de night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette could not get that refrain out of her head.\r\nShe would not willingly believe that Eus\xc3\xa8be had spoken the truth, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe been axen fo\xe2\x80\x99 you all t\xe2\x80\x99rough de night\xe2\x80\x94all t\xe2\x80\x99rough de night.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nwords kept ringing in her ears, as she came and went about her daily\r\ntasks. But by degrees she dismissed Eus\xc3\xa8be and his message from her\r\nmind. It was Miss Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s voice that she could hear in fancy following\r\nher, calling out through the night, \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99ere Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette? W\xe2\x80\x99y Tante\r\nCat\xe2\x80\x99rinette don\xe2\x80\x99 come? W\xe2\x80\x99y she don\xe2\x80\x99 come\xe2\x80\x94w\xe2\x80\x99y she don\xe2\x80\x99 come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll day the woman muttered and mumbled to herself in her Creole patois;\r\ninvoking council of \xe2\x80\x9cVieumaite,\xe2\x80\x9d as she always did in her troubles.\r\nTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette\xe2\x80\x99s religion was peculiarly her own; she turned to\r\nheaven with her grievances, it is true, but she felt that there was no\r\none in Paradise with whom she was quite so well acquainted as with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVieumaite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon she went and stood on her doorstep, and looked\r\nuneasily and anxiously out upon the almost deserted street. When a\r\nlittle girl came walking by,\xe2\x80\x94a sweet child with a frank and innocent\r\nface, upon whose word she knew she could rely,\xe2\x80\x94Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette invited\r\nher to enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome yere see Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette, Lolo. It\xe2\x80\x99s long time you en\xe2\x80\x99t come see\r\nTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rine; you gittin\xe2\x80\x99 proud.\xe2\x80\x9d She made the little one sit down,\r\nand offered her a couple of cookies, which the child accepted with\r\npretty avidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou putty good li\xe2\x80\x99le gal, you, Lolo. You keep on go confession all de\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 make my firs\xe2\x80\x99 communion firs\xe2\x80\x99 of May, Tante\r\nCat\xe2\x80\x99rinette.\xe2\x80\x9d A dog-eared catechism was sticking out of Lolo\xe2\x80\x99s apron\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDas right; be good li\xe2\x80\x99le gal. Mine yo\xe2\x80\x99 maman ev\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99ing she say; an\xe2\x80\x99 neva\r\ntell no story. It\xe2\x80\x99s nuttin\xe2\x80\x99 bad in dis worl\xe2\x80\x99 like tellin\xe2\x80\x99 lies. You know\r\nEus\xc3\xa8be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEus\xc3\xa8be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYas; dat li\xe2\x80\x99le ole Red River free m\xe2\x80\x99latto. Uh, uh! dat one man w\xe2\x80\x99at kin\r\ntell lies, yas! He come tell me Miss Kitty down sick yon\xe2\x80\x99a. You ev\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyeard such big story like dat, Lolo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child looked a little bewildered, but she answered promptly, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Taint\r\nno story, Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette. I yeard papa sayin\xe2\x80\x99, dinner time, Mr.\r\nRaymond sen\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99 Dr. Chalon. An\xe2\x80\x99 Dr. Chalon says he ain\xe2\x80\x99t got time to go\r\nyonda. An\xe2\x80\x99 papa says it\xe2\x80\x99s because Dr. Chalon on\xe2\x80\x99y want to go w\xe2\x80\x99ere it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrich people; an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99fraid Mista Raymond ain\xe2\x80\x99 goin\xe2\x80\x99 pay \xe2\x80\x99im.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette admired the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s pretty gingham dress, and\r\nasked her who had ironed it. She stroked her brown curls, and talked of\r\nall manner of things quite foreign to the subject of Eus\xc3\xa8be and his\r\nwicked propensity for telling lies.\r\n\r\nShe was not restless as she had been during the early part of the day,\r\nand she no longer mumbled and muttered as she had been doing over her\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAt night she lighted her coal-oil lamp, and placed it near a window\r\nwhere its light could be seen from the street through the half-closed\r\nshutters. Then she sat herself down, erect and motionless, in a chair.\r\n\r\nWhen it was near upon midnight, Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette arose, and looked\r\ncautiously, very cautiously, out of the door. Her house lay in the line\r\nof deep shadow that extended along the street. The other side was bathed\r\nin the pale light of the declining moon. The night was agreeably mild,\r\nprofoundly still, but pregnant with the subtle quivering life of early\r\nspring. The earth seemed asleep and breathing,\xe2\x80\x94a scent-laden breath that\r\nblew in soft puffs against Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette\xe2\x80\x99s face as she emerged from\r\nthe house. She closed and locked her door noiselessly; then she crept\r\nslowly away, treading softly, stealthily as a cat, in the deep shadow.\r\n\r\nThere were but few people abroad at that hour. Once she ran upon a gay\r\nparty of ladies and gentlemen who had been spending the evening over\r\ncards and anisette. They did not notice Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette almost\r\neffacing herself against the black wall of the cathedral. She breathed\r\nfreely and ventured from her retreat only when they had disappeared from\r\nview. Once a man saw her quite plainly, as she darted across a narrow\r\nstrip of moonlight. But Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette need not have gasped with\r\nfright as she did. He was too drunk to know if she were a thing of\r\nflesh, or only one of the fantastic, maddening shadows that the moon was\r\ncasting across his path to bewilder him. When she reached the outskirts\r\nof the town, and had to cross the broad piece of open country which\r\nstretched out toward the pine wood, an almost paralyzing terror came\r\nover her. But she crouched low, and hurried through the marsh and weeds,\r\navoiding the open road. She could have been mistaken for one of the\r\nbeasts browsing there where she passed.\r\n\r\nBut once in the Grand Ecore road that lay through the pine wood, she\r\nfelt secure and free to move as she pleased. Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette\r\nstraightened herself, stiffened herself in fact, and unconsciously\r\nassuming the attitude of the professional sprinter, she sped rapidly\r\nbeneath the Gothic interlacing branches of the pines. She talked\r\nconstantly to herself as she went, and to the animate and inanimate\r\nobjects around her. But her speech, far from intelligent, was hardly\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nShe addressed herself to the moon, which she apostrophized as an\r\nimpertinent busybody spying upon her actions. She pictured all manner of\r\ntroublesome animals, snakes, rabbits, frogs, pursuing her, but she\r\ndefied them to catch Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette, who was hurrying toward Miss Kitty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPa capab trap\xc3\xa9 Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette, vouzot; mo p\xc3\xa9 couri vite cot\xc3\xa9 Miss Kitty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe called up to a mocking-bird warbling upon a lofty limb of a pine\r\ntree, asking why it cried out so, and threatening to secure it and put\r\nit into a cage. \xe2\x80\x9cCa to p\xc3\xa9 cri\xc3\xa9 comme \xc3\xa7a, ti c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9ra? Arete, mo trap\xc3\xa9\r\nzozos la, mo m\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 li dan ain bon lacage.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette\r\nseemed on very familiar terms with the night, with the forest, and with\r\nall the flying, creeping, crawling things that inhabit it. At the speed\r\nwith which she traveled she soon had covered the few miles of wooded\r\nroad, and before long had reached her destination.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping-room of Miss Kitty opened upon the long outside gallery, as\r\ndid all the rooms of the unpretentious frame house which was her home.\r\nThe place could hardly be called a plantation; it was too small for\r\nthat. Nevertheless Raymond was trying to plant; trying to teach school\r\nbetween times, in the end room; and sometimes, when he found himself in\r\na tight place, trying to clerk for Mr. Jacobs over in Campte, across Red\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette mounted the creaking steps, crossed the gallery, and\r\nentered Miss Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s room as though she were returning to it after a few\r\nmoments\xe2\x80\x99 absence. There was a lamp burning dimly upon the high\r\nmantelpiece. Raymond had evidently not been to bed; he was in shirt\r\nsleeves, rocking the baby\xe2\x80\x99s cradle. It was the same mahogany cradle\r\nwhich had held Miss Kitty thirty-five years before, when Tante\r\nCat\xe2\x80\x99rinette had rocked it. The cradle had been bought then to match the\r\nbed,\xe2\x80\x94that big, beautiful bed on which Miss Kitty lay now in a restless\r\nhalf slumber. There was a fine French clock on the mantel, still telling\r\nthe hours as it had told them years ago. But there were no carpets or\r\nrugs on the floors. There was no servant in the house.\r\n\r\nRaymond uttered an exclamation of amazement when he saw Tante\r\nCat\xe2\x80\x99rinette enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you do, Mich\xc3\xa9 Raymond?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI yeard Miss Kitty been\r\nsick; Eus\xc3\xa8be tell me dat dis mo\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved toward the bed as lightly as though shod with velvet, and\r\nseated herself there. Miss Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s hand lay outside the coverlid; a\r\nshapely hand, which her few days of illness and rest had not yet\r\nsoftened. The negress laid her own black hand upon it. At the touch Miss\r\nKitty instinctively turned her palm upward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a note of satisfaction in\r\nher feeble voice. \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99en did you come, Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette? They all said\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 come ev\xe2\x80\x99y night, cher coeur, ev\xe2\x80\x99y night tell you be well.\r\nTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette can\xe2\x80\x99t come daytime no mo\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRaymond tole me about it. They doin\xe2\x80\x99 you mighty mean in town, Tante\r\nCat\xe2\x80\x99rinette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNev\xe2\x80\x99 mine, ti chou. I know how take care dat w\xe2\x80\x99at Vieumaite gi\xe2\x80\x99 me. You\r\ngo sleep now. Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette goin\xe2\x80\x99 set yere an\xe2\x80\x99 mine you. She goin\xe2\x80\x99 make\r\nyou well like she all time do. We don\xe2\x80\x99 wan\xe2\x80\x99 no c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9ra doctor. We drive\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em out wid a stick, dey come roun\xe2\x80\x99 yere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Kitty was soon sleeping more restfully than she had done since her\r\nillness began. Raymond had finally succeeded in quieting the baby, and\r\nhe tiptoed into the adjoining room, where the other children lay, to\r\nsnatch a few hours of much-needed rest for himself. Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette sat\r\nfaithfully beside her charge, administering at intervals to the sick\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s wants.\r\n\r\nBut the thought of regaining her home before daybreak, and of the urgent\r\nnecessity for doing so, did not leave Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette\xe2\x80\x99s mind for an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nIn the profound darkness, the deep stillness of the night that comes\r\nbefore dawn, she was walking again through the woods, on her way back to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe mocking-birds were asleep, and so were the frogs and the snakes; and\r\nthe moon was gone, and so was the breeze. She walked now in utter\r\nsilence but for the heavy guttural breathing that accompanied her rapid\r\nfootsteps. She walked with a desperate determination along the road,\r\nevery foot of which was familiar to her.\r\n\r\nWhen she at last emerged from the woods, the earth about her was\r\nfaintly, very faintly, beginning to reveal itself in the tremulous,\r\ngray, uncertain light of approaching day. She staggered and plunged\r\nonward with beating pulses quickened by fear.\r\n\r\nA sudden turn, and Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette stood facing the river. She stopped\r\nabruptly, as if at command of some unseen power that forced her. For an\r\ninstant she pressed a black hand against her tired, burning eyes, and\r\nstared fixedly ahead of her.\r\n\r\nTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette had always believed that Paradise was up there\r\noverhead where the sun and stars and moon are, and that \xe2\x80\x9cVieumaite\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninhabited that region of splendor. She never for a moment doubted this.\r\nIt would be difficult, perhaps unsatisfying, to explain why Tante\r\nCat\xe2\x80\x99rinette, on that particular morning, when a vision of the rising day\r\nbroke suddenly upon her, should have believed that she stood in face of\r\na heavenly revelation. But why not, after all? Since she talked so\r\nfamiliarly herself to the unseen, why should it not respond to her when\r\nthe time came?\r\n\r\nAcross the narrow, quivering line of water, the delicate budding\r\nbranches of young trees were limned black against the gold, orange,\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nword is there to tell the color of that morning sky! And steeped in the\r\nsplendor of it hung one pale star; there was not another in the whole\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nTante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette stood with her eyes fixed intently upon that star,\r\nwhich held her like a hypnotic spell. She stammered breathlessly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMo p\xc3\xa9 cout\xc3\xa9, Vieumaite. Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette p\xc3\xa9 cout\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d (I am listening,\r\nVieumaite. Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette hears you.)\r\n\r\nShe stayed there motionless upon the brink of the river till the star\r\nmelted into the brightness of the day and became part of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette entered Miss Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s room for the second time,\r\nthe aspect of things had changed somewhat. Miss Kitty was with much\r\ndifficulty holding the baby while Raymond mixed a saucer of food for the\r\nlittle one. Their oldest daughter, a child of twelve, had come into the\r\nroom with an apronful of chips from the woodpile, and was striving to\r\nstart a fire on the hearth, to make the morning coffee. The room seemed\r\nbare and almost squalid in the daylight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yere Tante Cat\xe2\x80\x99rinette come back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly announcing\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThey could not well understand why she was back; but it was good to have\r\nher there, and they did not question.\r\n\r\nShe took the baby from its mother, and, seating herself, began to feed\r\nit from the saucer which Raymond placed beside her on a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYas,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cCat\xe2\x80\x99rinette goin\xe2\x80\x99 stay; dis time she en\xe2\x80\x99t nev\xe2\x80\x99 goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x99way no mo\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHusband and wife looked at each other with surprised, questioning eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMich\xc3\xa9 Raymond,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the woman, turning her head up to him with a\r\ncertain comical shrewdness in her glance, \xe2\x80\x9cif somebody want len\xe2\x80\x99 you\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99ousan\xe2\x80\x99 dolla\xe2\x80\x99, w\xe2\x80\x99at you goin\xe2\x80\x99 say?

He had been her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s college friend; was now a journalist, and in no sense a\r\nsociety man or \xe2\x80\x9ca man about town,\xe2\x80\x9d which were, perhaps, some of the\r\nreasons she had never met him. But she had unconsciously formed an image\r\nof him in her mind. She pictured him tall, slim, cynical; with\r\neye-glasses, and his hands in his pockets; and she did not like him.\r\nGouvernail was slim enough, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very tall nor very cynical;\r\nneither did he wear eye-glasses nor carry his hands in his pockets. And\r\nshe rather liked him when he first presented himself.\r\n\r\nBut why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to herself\r\nwhen she partly attempted to do so. She could discover in him none of\r\nthose brilliant and promising traits which Gaston, her husband, had\r\noften assured her that he possessed. On the contrary, he sat rather mute\r\nand receptive before her chatty eagerness to make him feel at home and\r\nin face of Gaston\xe2\x80\x99s frank and wordy hospitality. His manner was as\r\ncourteous toward her as the most exacting woman could require; but he\r\nmade no direct appeal to her approval or even esteem.\r\n\r\nOnce settled at the plantation he seemed to like to sit upon the wide\r\nportico in the shade of one of the big Corinthian pillars, smoking his\r\ncigar lazily and listening attentively to Gaston\xe2\x80\x99s experience as a sugar\r\nplanter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I call living,\xe2\x80\x9d he would utter with deep satisfaction, as\r\nthe air that swept across the sugar field caressed him with its warm and\r\nscented velvety touch. It pleased him also to get on familiar terms with\r\nthe big dogs that came about him, rubbing themselves sociably against\r\nhis legs. He did not care to fish, and displayed no eagerness to go out\r\nand kill grosbecs when Gaston proposed doing so.\r\n\r\nGouvernail\xe2\x80\x99s personality puzzled Mrs. Baroda, but she liked him. Indeed,\r\nhe was a lovable, inoffensive fellow. After a few days, when she could\r\nunderstand him no better than at first, she gave over being puzzled and\r\nremained piqued. In this mood she left her husband and her guest, for\r\nthe most part, alone together. Then finding that Gouvernail took no\r\nmanner of exception to her action, she imposed her society upon him,\r\naccompanying him in his idle strolls to the mill and walks along the\r\nbatture. She persistently sought to penetrate the reserve in which he\r\nhad unconsciously enveloped himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is he going\xe2\x80\x94your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d she one day asked her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my\r\npart, he tires me frightfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for a week yet, dear. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand; he gives you no trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I should like him better if he did; if he were more like others,\r\nand I had to plan somewhat for his comfort and enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGaston took his wife\xe2\x80\x99s pretty face between his hands and looked tenderly\r\nand laughingly into her troubled eyes. They were making a bit of toilet\r\nsociably together in Mrs. Baroda\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are full of surprises, ma belle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. \xe2\x80\x9cEven I can never\r\ncount upon how you are going to act under given conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d He kissed\r\nher and turned to fasten his cravat before the mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9ctaking poor Gouvernail seriously and making\r\na commotion over him, the last thing he would desire or expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommotion!\xe2\x80\x9d she hotly resented. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! How can you say such a\r\nthing? Commotion, indeed! But, you know, you said he was clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he is. But the poor fellow is run down by overwork now. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\r\nasked him here to take a rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used to say he was a man of ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, unconciliated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nexpected him to be interesting, at least. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the city in the\r\nmorning to have my spring gowns fitted. Let me know when Mr. Gouvernail\r\nis gone; I shall be at my Aunt Octavie\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night she went and sat alone upon a bench that stood beneath a live\r\noak tree at the edge of the gravel walk.\r\n\r\nShe had never known her thoughts or her intentions to be so confused.\r\nShe could gather nothing from them but the feeling of a distinct\r\nnecessity to quit her home in the morning.\r\n\r\nMrs. Baroda heard footsteps crunching the gravel; but could discern in\r\nthe darkness only the approaching red point of a lighted cigar. She knew\r\nit was Gouvernail, for her husband did not smoke. She hoped to remain\r\nunnoticed, but her white gown revealed her to him. He threw away his\r\ncigar and seated himself upon the bench beside her; without a suspicion\r\nthat she might object to his presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband told me to bring this to you, Mrs. Baroda,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nhanding her a filmy, white scarf with which she sometimes enveloped her\r\nhead and shoulders. She accepted the scarf from him with a murmur of\r\nthanks, and let it lie in her lap.\r\n\r\nHe made some commonplace observation upon the baneful effect of the\r\nnight air at that season. Then as his gaze reached out into the\r\ndarkness, he murmured, half to himself:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Night of south winds\xe2\x80\x94night of the large few stars!\r\n            Still nodding night\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply to this apostrophe to the night, which indeed, was not\r\naddressed to her.\r\n\r\nGouvernail was in no sense a diffident man, for he was not a\r\nself-conscious one. His periods of reserve were not constitutional, but\r\nthe result of moods. Sitting there beside Mrs. Baroda, his silence\r\nmelted for the time.\r\n\r\nHe talked freely and intimately in a low, hesitating drawl that was not\r\nunpleasant to hear. He talked of the old college days when he and Gaston\r\nhad been a good deal to each other; of the days of keen and blind\r\nambitions and large intentions. Now there was left with him, at least, a\r\nphilosophic acquiescence to the existing order\xe2\x80\x94only a desire to be\r\npermitted to exist, with now and then a little whiff of genuine life,\r\nsuch as he was breathing now.\r\n\r\nHer mind only vaguely grasped what he was saying. Her physical being was\r\nfor the moment predominant. She was not thinking of his words, only\r\ndrinking in the tones of his voice. She wanted to reach out her hand in\r\nthe darkness and touch him with the sensitive tips of her fingers upon\r\nthe face or the lips. She wanted to draw close to him and whisper\r\nagainst his cheek\xe2\x80\x94she did not care what\xe2\x80\x94as she might have done if she\r\nhad not been a respectable woman.\r\n\r\nThe stronger the impulse grew to bring herself near him, the further, in\r\nfact, did she draw away from him. As soon as she could do so without an\r\nappearance of too great rudeness, she rose and left him there alone.\r\n\r\nBefore she reached the house, Gouvernail had lighted a fresh cigar and\r\nended his apostrophe to the night.\r\n\r\nMrs. Baroda was greatly tempted that night to tell her husband\xe2\x80\x94who was\r\nalso her friend\xe2\x80\x94of this folly that had seized her. But she did not yield\r\nto the temptation. Beside being a respectable woman she was a very\r\nsensible one; and she knew there are some battles in life which a human\r\nbeing must fight alone.\r\n\r\nWhen Gaston arose in the morning, his wife had already departed. She had\r\ntaken an early morning train to the city. She did not return till\r\nGouvernail was gone from under her roof.\r\n\r\nThere was some talk of having him back during the summer that followed.\r\nThat is, Gaston greatly desired it; but this desire yielded to his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s strenuous opposition.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the year ended, she proposed, wholly from herself, to\r\nhave Gouvernail visit them again. Her husband was surprised and\r\ndelighted with the suggestion coming from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad, ch\xc3\xa8re amie, to know that you have finally overcome your\r\ndislike for him; truly he did not deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him, laughingly, after pressing a long, tender kiss upon\r\nhis lips, \xe2\x80\x9cI have overcome everything! you will see. This time I shall\r\nbe very nice to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               Ripe Figs\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               Ripe Figs\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMaman-Nainaine said that when the figs were ripe Babette might go to\r\nvisit her cousins down on the Bayou-Lafourche where the sugar cane\r\ngrows. Not that the ripening of figs had the least thing to do with it,\r\nbut that is the way Maman-Nainaine was.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Babette a very long time to wait; for the leaves upon the\r\ntrees were tender yet, and the figs were like little hard, green\r\nmarbles.\r\n\r\nBut warm rains came along and plenty of strong sunshine, and though\r\nMaman-Nainaine was as patient as the statue of la Madone, and Babette as\r\nrestless as a humming-bird, the first thing they both knew it was hot\r\nsummer-time. Every day Babette danced out to where the fig-trees were in\r\na long line against the fence. She walked slowly beneath them, carefully\r\npeering between the gnarled, spreading branches. But each time she came\r\ndisconsolate away again. What she saw there finally was something that\r\nmade her sing and dance the whole long day.\r\n\r\nWhen Maman-Nainaine sat down in her stately way to breakfast, the\r\nfollowing morning, her muslin cap standing like an aureole about her\r\nwhite, placid face, Babette approached. She bore a dainty porcelain\r\nplatter, which she set down before her godmother. It contained a dozen\r\npurple figs, fringed around with their rich, green leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maman-Nainaine, arching her eyebrows, \xe2\x80\x9chow early the figs\r\nhave ripened this year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babette, \xe2\x80\x9cI think they have ripened very late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBabette,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Maman-Nainaine, as she peeled the very plumpest\r\nfigs with her pointed silver fruit-knife, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will carry my love to\r\nthem all down on Bayou-Lafourche. And tell your Tante Frosine I shall\r\nlook for her at Toussaint\xe2\x80\x94when the chrysanthemums are in bloom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            Oz\xc3\xa8me\xe2\x80\x99s Holiday\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            Oz\xc3\xa8me\xe2\x80\x99s Holiday\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nOz\xc3\xa8me often wondered why there was not a special dispensation of\r\nprovidence to do away with the necessity for work. There seemed to him\r\nso much created for man\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment in this world, and so little time\r\nand opportunity to profit by it. To sit and do nothing but breathe was a\r\npleasure to Oz\xc3\xa8me; but to sit in the company of a few choice companions,\r\nincluding a sprinkling of ladies, was even a greater delight; and the\r\njoy which a day\xe2\x80\x99s hunting or fishing or picnicking afforded him is\r\nhardly to be described. Yet he was by no means indolent. He worked\r\nfaithfully on the plantation the whole year long, in a sort of\r\nmethodical way; but when the time came around for his annual week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nholiday, there was no holding him back. It was often decidedly\r\ninconvenient for the planter that Oz\xc3\xa8me usually chose to take his\r\nholiday during some very busy season of the year.\r\n\r\nHe started out one morning in the beginning of October. He had borrowed\r\nMr. Laballi\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x99s buckboard and Padue\xe2\x80\x99s old gray mare, and a harness from\r\nthe negro S\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa9rin. He wore a light blue suit which had been sent all the\r\nway from St. Louis, and which had cost him ten dollars; he had paid\r\nalmost as much again for his boots; and his hat was a broad-rimmed gray\r\nfelt which he had no cause to be ashamed of. When Oz\xc3\xa8me went \xe2\x80\x9cbroading,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe dressed\xe2\x80\x94well, regardless of cost. His eyes were blue and mild; his\r\nhair was light, and he wore it rather long; he was clean shaven, and\r\nreally did not look his thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nOz\xc3\xa8me had laid his plans weeks beforehand. He was going visiting along\r\nCane River; the mere contemplation filled him with pleasure. He counted\r\nupon reaching F\xc3\xa9deaus\xe2\x80\x99 about noon, and he would stop and dine there.\r\nPerhaps they would ask him to stay all night. He really did not hold to\r\nstaying all night, and was not decided to accept if they did ask him.\r\nThere were only the two old people, and he rather fancied the notion of\r\npushing on to Beltrans\xe2\x80\x99, where he would stay a night, or even two, if\r\nurged. He was quite sure that there would be something agreeable going\r\non at Beltrans\xe2\x80\x99, with all those young people\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a fish-fry, or\r\npossibly a ball!\r\n\r\nOf course he would have to give a day to Tante Sophie and another to\r\nCousine Victoire; but none to the St. Annes unless entreated\xe2\x80\x94after St.\r\nAnne reproaching him last year with being a fain\xc3\xa9ant for broading at\r\nsuch a season! At Cloutierville, where he would linger as long as\r\npossible, he meant to turn and retrace his course, zigzagging back and\r\nforth across Cane River so as to take in the Duplans, the Velcours, and\r\nothers that he could not at the moment recall. A week seemed to Oz\xc3\xa8me a\r\nvery, very little while in which to crowd so much pleasure.\r\n\r\nThere were steam-gins at work; he could hear them whistling far and\r\nnear. On both sides of the river the fields were white with cotton, and\r\neverybody in the world seemed busy but Oz\xc3\xa8me. This reflection did not\r\ndistress or disturb him in the least; he pursued his way at peace with\r\nhimself and his surroundings.\r\n\r\nAt Lam\xc3\xa9rie\xe2\x80\x99s cross-roads store, where he stopped to buy a cigar, he\r\nlearned that there was no use heading for F\xc3\xa9deaus\xe2\x80\x99, as the two old\r\npeople had gone to town for a lengthy visit, and the house was locked\r\nup. It was at F\xc3\xa9deaus\xe2\x80\x99 that Oz\xc3\xa8me had intended to dine.\r\n\r\nHe sat in the buckboard, given up to a moment or two of reflection. The\r\nresult was that he turned away from the river, and entered the road that\r\nled between two fields back to the woods and into the heart of the\r\ncountry. He had determined upon taking a short cut to the Beltrans\xe2\x80\x99\r\nplantation, and on the way he meant to keep an eye open for old Aunt\r\nTildy\xe2\x80\x99s cabin, which he knew lay in some remote part of this cut-off. He\r\nremembered that Aunt Tildy could cook an excellent meal if she had the\r\nmaterial at hand. He would induce her to fry him a chicken, drip a cup\r\nof coffee, and turn him out a pone of corn-bread, which he thought would\r\nbe sumptuous enough fare for the occasion.\r\n\r\nAunt Tildy dwelt in the not unusual log cabin, of one room, with its\r\nchimney of mud and stone, and its shallow gallery formed by the jutting\r\nof the roof. In close proximity to the cabin was a small cotton-field,\r\nwhich from a long distance looked like a field of snow. The cotton was\r\nbursting and overflowing foam-like from bolls on the drying stalk. On\r\nthe lower branches it was hanging ragged and tattered, and much of it\r\nhad already fallen to the ground. There were a few chinaberry-trees in\r\nthe yard before the hut, and under one of them an ancient and\r\nrusty-looking mule was eating corn from a wood trough. Some common\r\nlittle Creole chickens were scratching about the mule\xe2\x80\x99s feet and\r\nsnatching at the grains of corn that occasionally fell from the trough.\r\n\r\nAunt Tildy was hobbling across the yard when Oz\xc3\xa8me drew up before the\r\ngate. One hand was confined in a sling; in the other she carried a tin\r\npan, which she let fall noisily to the ground when she recognized him.\r\nShe was broad, black, and misshapen, with her body bent forward almost\r\nat an acute angle. She wore a blue cottonade of large plaids, and a\r\nbandana awkwardly twisted around her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God A\xe2\x80\x99mighty, man! Whar you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d was her startled\r\nexclamation at beholding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x99om home, Aunt Tildy; w\xe2\x80\x99ere else do you expec\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oz\xc3\xa8me,\r\ndismounting composedly.\r\n\r\nHe had not seen the old woman for several years\xe2\x80\x94since she was cooking in\r\ntown for the family with which he boarded at the time. She had washed\r\nand ironed for him, atrociously, it is true, but her intentions were\r\nbeyond reproach if her washing was not. She had also been clumsily\r\nattentive to him during a spell of illness. He had paid her with an\r\noccasional bandana, a calico dress, or a checked apron, and they had\r\nalways considered the account between themselves square, with no\r\nsentimental feeling of gratitude remaining on either side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to know,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Oz\xc3\xa8me, as he took the gray mare from the\r\nshafts, and led her up to the trough where the mule was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI like to know\r\nw\xe2\x80\x99at you mean by makin\xe2\x80\x99 a crop like that an\xe2\x80\x99 then lettin\xe2\x80\x99 it go to\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x99e?

He foresaw no prospect of\r\ndinner unless he should cook it himself. And there was that Sandy\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nremembered well the little scamp of eight, always at his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheels when she was cooking or washing. Of course he would have to go in\r\nand look at the boy, and no doubt dive into his traveling-bag for\r\nquinine, without which he never traveled.\r\n\r\nSandy was indeed very ill, consumed with fever. He lay on a cot covered\r\nup with a faded patchwork quilt. His eyes were half closed, and he was\r\nmuttering and rambling on about hoeing and bedding and cleaning and\r\nthinning out the cotton; he was hauling it to the gin, wrangling about\r\nweight and bagging and ties and the price offered per pound. That bale\r\nor two of cotton had not only sent Sandy to bed, but had pursued him\r\nthere, holding him through his fevered dreams, and threatening to end\r\nhim. Oz\xc3\xa8me would never have known the black boy, he was so tall, so\r\nthin, and seemingly so wasted, lying there in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee yere, Aunt Tildy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oz\xc3\xa8me, after he had, as was usual with him\r\nwhen in doubt, abandoned himself to a little reflection; \xe2\x80\x9cbetween us\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 me\xe2\x80\x94we got to manage to kill an\xe2\x80\x99 cook one o\xe2\x80\x99 those chickens I see\r\nscratchin\xe2\x80\x99 out yonda, fo\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m jus\xe2\x80\x99 about starved. I reckon you ain\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nany quinine in the house? No; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose an instant you had. Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to give Sandy a good dose o\xe2\x80\x99 quinine to-night, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstay an\xe2\x80\x99 see how that\xe2\x80\x99ll work on \xe2\x80\x99im. But sun-up, min\xe2\x80\x99 you, I mus\xe2\x80\x99 get\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 yere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOz\xc3\xa8me had spent more comfortable nights than the one passed in Aunt\r\nTildy\xe2\x80\x99s bed, which she considerately abandoned to him.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Sandy\xe2\x80\x99s fever was somewhat abated, but had not taken a\r\ndecided enough turn to justify Oz\xc3\xa8me in quitting him before noon, unless\r\nhe was willing \xe2\x80\x9cto feel like a dog,\xe2\x80\x9d as he told himself. He appeared\r\nbefore Aunt Tildy stripped to the undershirt, and wearing his\r\nsecond-best pair of trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a nice pickle o\xe2\x80\x99 fish you got me in, ol\xe2\x80\x99 woman. I guarantee,\r\nnex\xe2\x80\x99 time I go abroad, \xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t me that\xe2\x80\x99ll take any cut-off. W\xe2\x80\x99ere\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\ncotton-basket an\xe2\x80\x99 cotton-sack o\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knowed it!\xe2\x80\x9d chanted Aunt Tildy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI knowed de Lord war gwine sen\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsomebody to holp me out. He war n\xe2\x80\x99 gwine let de crap was\xe2\x80\x99e atter he give\r\nSandy an\xe2\x80\x99 me de strenk to make hit. De Lord gwine shove you \xe2\x80\x99long de\r\nrow, Mista Oz\xc3\xa8me. De Lord gwine give you plenty mo\xe2\x80\x99 fingers an\xe2\x80\x99 han\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\npick dat cotton nimble an\xe2\x80\x99 clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeva you min\xe2\x80\x99 w\xe2\x80\x99at the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do; go get me that cotton-sack.\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 you put that poultice like I tol\xe2\x80\x99 you on yo\xe2\x80\x99 han\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 set down\r\nthere an\xe2\x80\x99 watch Sandy. It looks like you are \xe2\x80\x99bout as helpless as a\xe2\x80\x99 ol\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncow tangled up in a potato-vine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOz\xc3\xa8me had not picked cotton for many years, and he took to it a little\r\nawkwardly at first; but by the time he had reached the end of the first\r\nrow the old dexterity of youth had come back to his hands, which flew\r\nrapidly back and forth with the motion of a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s shuttle; and his\r\nten fingers became really nimble in clutching the cotton from its dry\r\nshell. By noon he had gathered about fifty pounds. Sandy was not then\r\nquite so well as he had promised to be, and Oz\xc3\xa8me concluded to stay that\r\nday and one more night. If the boy were no better in the morning, he\r\nwould go off in search of a doctor for him, and he himself would\r\ncontinue on down to Tante Sophie\xe2\x80\x99s; the Beltrans\xe2\x80\x99 was out of the\r\nquestion now.\r\n\r\nSandy hardly needed a doctor in the morning. Oz\xc3\xa8me\xe2\x80\x99s doctoring was\r\nbeginning to tell favorably; but he would have considered it criminal\r\nindifference and negligence to go away and leave the boy to Aunt Tildy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nawkward ministrations just at the critical moment when there was a turn\r\nfor the better; so he stayed that day out, and picked his hundred and\r\nfifty pounds.\r\n\r\nOn the third day it looked like rain, and a heavy rain just then would\r\nmean a heavy loss to Aunt Tildy and Sandy, and Oz\xc3\xa8me again went to the\r\nfield, this time urging Aunt Tildy with him to do what she might with\r\nher one good hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Tildy,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Oz\xc3\xa8me to the bent old woman moving ahead of him\r\nbetween the white rows of cotton, \xe2\x80\x9cif the Lord gets me safe out o\xe2\x80\x99 this\r\nditch, \xe2\x80\x99t ain\xe2\x80\x99t to-morro\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll fall in anotha with my eyes open, I bet\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep along, Mista Oz\xc3\xa8me; don\xe2\x80\x99 grumble, don\xe2\x80\x99 stumble; de Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na-watchin\xe2\x80\x99 you. Look at yo\xe2\x80\x99 Aunt Tildy; she doin\xe2\x80\x99 mo\xe2\x80\x99 wid her one han\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x99an you doin\xe2\x80\x99 wid yo\xe2\x80\x99 two, man. Keep right along, honey. Watch dat\r\ncotton how it fallin\xe2\x80\x99 in yo\xe2\x80\x99 Aunt Tildy\xe2\x80\x99s bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am watchin\xe2\x80\x99 you, ol\xe2\x80\x99 woman; you don\xe2\x80\x99 fool me. You got to work that\r\nhan\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99s spryer than you doin\xe2\x80\x99, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the rawhide. You done\r\nfo\xe2\x80\x99got w\xe2\x80\x99at the rawhide tas\xe2\x80\x99e like, I reckon\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a reminder which amused\r\nAunt Tildy so powerfully that her big negro-laugh resounded over the\r\nwhole cotton-patch, and even caused Sandy, who heard it, to turn in his\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still threatening on the succeeding day, and a sort of\r\ndogged determination or characteristic desire to see his undertakings\r\ncarried to a satisfactory completion urged Oz\xc3\xa8me to continue his efforts\r\nto drag Aunt Tildy out of the mire into which circumstances seemed to\r\nhave thrust her.\r\n\r\nOne night the rain did come, and began to beat softly on the roof of the\r\nold cabin. Sandy opened his eyes, which were no longer brilliant with\r\nthe fever flame. \xe2\x80\x9cGranny,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cde rain! Des listen, granny;\r\nde rain a-comin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 I ain\xe2\x80\x99 pick dat cotton yit. W\xe2\x80\x99at time it is? Gi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme my pants\xe2\x80\x94I got to go\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lay whar you is, chile alive. Dat cotton put aside clean and dry.\r\nMe an\xe2\x80\x99 de Lord an\xe2\x80\x99 Mista Oz\xc3\xa8me done pick dat cotton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOz\xc3\xa8me drove away in the morning looking quite as spick and span as the\r\nday he left home in his blue suit and his light felt drawn a little over\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to take care o\xe2\x80\x99 that boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he instructed Aunt Tildy at\r\nparting, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 get \xe2\x80\x99im on his feet. An\xe2\x80\x99, let me tell you, the nex\xe2\x80\x99 time I\r\nstart out to broad, if you see me passin\xe2\x80\x99 in this yere cut-off, put on\r\nyo\xe2\x80\x99 specs an\xe2\x80\x99 look at me good, because it won\xe2\x80\x99t be me; it\xe2\x80\x99ll be my\r\nghos\xe2\x80\x99, ol\xe2\x80\x99 woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed, Oz\xc3\xa8me, for some reason or other, felt quite shamefaced as he\r\ndrove back to the plantation. When he emerged from the lane which he had\r\nentered the week before, and turned into the river road, Lam\xc3\xa9rie,\r\nstanding in the store door, shouted out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xa9, Oz\xc3\xa8me! you had good times yonda? I bet you danced holes in the sole\r\nof them new boots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk, Lam\xc3\xa9rie!\xe2\x80\x9d was Oz\xc3\xa8me\xe2\x80\x99s rather ambiguous reply, as he\r\nflourished the remainder of a whip over the old gray mare\xe2\x80\x99s sway-back,\r\nurging her to a gentle trot.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home, Bod\xc3\xa9, one of Padue\xe2\x80\x99s boys, who was assisting him\r\nto unhitch, remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow come you didn\xe2\x80\x99 go yonda down de coas\xe2\x80\x99 like you said, Mista Oz\xc3\xa8me?\r\nNobody didn\xe2\x80\x99 see you in Cloutierville, an\xe2\x80\x99 Mailitte say you neva cross\xe2\x80\x99\r\nde twenty-fo\xe2\x80\x99-mile ferry, an\xe2\x80\x99 nobody didn\xe2\x80\x99 see you no place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOz\xc3\xa8me returned, after his customary moment of reflection:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99mos\xe2\x80\x99 always the same thing on Cane riva, my boy; a man\r\ngets tired o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xc3\xa0 la fin.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
