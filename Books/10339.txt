The\r\npublic is free to believe them or not, at its good pleasure.\r\n\r\nNo more appropriate scene for the wonderful and terrible adventures\r\nwhich I am about to relate could be imagined than the Desolation\r\nIslands, so called, in 1779, by Captain Cook. I lived there for\r\nseveral weeks, and I can affirm, on the evidence of my own eyes and\r\nmy own experience, that the famous English explorer and navigator\r\nwas happily inspired when he gave the islands that significant name.\r\n\r\nGeographical nomenclature, however, insists on the name of\r\nKerguelen, which is generally adopted for the group which lies in\r\n49\xc2\xb0 45\' south latitude, and 69\xc2\xb0 6\' east longitude. This is\r\njust, because in 1772, Baron Kerguelen, a Frenchman, was the first\r\nto discover those islands in the southern part of the Indian Ocean.\r\nIndeed, the commander of the squadron on that voyage believed that\r\nhe had found a new continent on the limit of the Antarctic seas, but\r\nin the course of a second expedition he recognized his error. There\r\nwas only an archipelago. I may be believed when I assert that\r\nDesolation Islands is the only suitable name for this group of three\r\nhundred isles or islets in the midst of the vast expanse of ocean,\r\nwhich is constantly disturbed by austral storms.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the group is inhabited, and the number of Europeans\r\nand Americans who formed the nucleus of the Kerguelen population at\r\nthe date of the 2nd of August, 1839, had been augmented for two\r\nmonths past by a unit in my person. Just then I was waiting for an\r\nopportunity of leaving the place, having completed the geological\r\nand mineralogical studies which had brought me to the group in\r\ngeneral and to Christmas Harbour in particular.\r\n\r\nChristmas Harbour belongs to the most important islet of the\r\narchipelago, one that is about half as large as Corsica. It is safe,\r\nand easy, and free of access. Your ship may ride securely at single\r\nanchor in its waters, while the bay remains free from ice.\r\n\r\nThe Kerguelens possess hundreds of other fjords. Their coasts are\r\nnotched and ragged, especially in the parts between the north and\r\nthe south-east, where little islets abound. The soil, of volcanic\r\norigin, is composed of quartz, mixed with a bluish stone. In summer\r\nit is covered with green mosses, grey lichens, various hardy plants,\r\nespecially wild saxifrage. Only one edible plant grows there, a kind\r\nof cabbage, not found anywhere else, and very bitter of flavour.\r\nGreat flocks of royal and other penguins people these islets,\r\nfinding good lodging on their rocky and mossy surface. These stupid\r\nbirds, in their yellow and white feathers, with their heads thrown\r\nback and their wings like the sleeves of a monastic habit, look, at\r\na distance, like monks in single file walking in procession along\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\nThe islands afford refuge to numbers of sea-calves, seals, and\r\nsea-elephants. The taking of those amphibious animals either on land\r\nor from the sea is profitable, and may lead to a trade which will\r\nbring a large number of vessels into these waters.\r\n\r\nOn the day already mentioned, I was accosted while strolling on the\r\nport by mine host of mine inn.\r\n\r\n"Unless I am much mistaken, time is beginning to seem very long to\r\nyou, Mr. Jeorling?"\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a big tall American who kept the only inn on the\r\nport.\r\n\r\n"If you will not be offended, Mr. Atkins, I will acknowledge that\r\nI do find it long."\r\n\r\n"Of course I won\'t be offended. Am I not as well used to answers\r\nof that kind as the rocks of the Cape to the rollers?"\r\n\r\n"And you resist them equally well."\r\n\r\n"Of course. From the day of your arrival at Christmas Harbour,\r\nwhen you came to the Green Cormorant, I said to myself that in a\r\nfortnight, if not in a week, you would have enough of it, and would\r\nbe sorry you had landed in the Kerguelens."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Mr. Atkins; I never regret anything I have done."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good habit, sir."\r\n\r\n"Besides, I have gained knowledge by observing curious things\r\nhere. I have crossed the rolling plains, covered with hard stringy\r\nmosses, and I shall take away curious mineralogical and geological\r\nspecimens with me. I have gone sealing, and taken sea-calves with\r\nyour people. I have visited the rookeries where the penguin and the\r\nalbatross live together in good fellowship, and that was well worth\r\nmy while. You have given me now and again a dish of petrel, seasoned\r\nby your own hand, and very acceptable when one has a fine healthy\r\nappetite. I have found a friendly welcome at the Green Cormorant,\r\nand I am very much obliged to you. But, if I am right in my\r\nreckoning, it is two months since the Chilian two-master _Pe\xc3\xb1as_ set\r\nme down at Christmas Harbour in mid-winter.\r\n\r\n"And you want to get back to your own country, which is mine, Mr.\r\nJeorling; to return to Connecticut, to Providence, our capital."\r\n\r\n"Doubtless, Mr. Atkins, for I have been a globe-trotter for close\r\nupon three years. One must come to a stop and take root at some\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and when one has taken root, one puts out branches."\r\n\r\n"Just so, Mr. Atkins. However, as I have no relations living, it\r\nis likely that I shall be the last of my line. I am not likely to\r\ntake a fancy for marrying at forty."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, that is a matter of taste. Fifteen years ago I\r\nsettled down comfortably at Christmas Harbour with my Betsy; she has\r\npresented me with ten children, who in their turn will present me\r\nwith grandchildren."\r\n\r\n"You will not return to the old country?"\r\n\r\n"What should I do there, Mr. Jeorling, and what could I ever have\r\ndone there? There was nothing before me but poverty. Here, on the\r\ncontrary, in these Islands of Desolation, where I have no reason to\r\nfeel desolate, ease and competence have come to me and mine!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt, and I congratulate you, Mr. Atkins, for you are a happy\r\nman. Nevertheless it is not impossible that the fancy may take you\r\nsome day--"\r\n\r\nMr. Atkins answered by a vigorous and convincing shake of the head.\r\nIt was very pleasant to hear this worthy American talk. He was\r\ncompletely acclimatized on his archipelago, and to the conditions of\r\nlife there. He lived with his family as the penguins lived in their\r\nrookeries. His wife was a "valiant" woman of the Scriptural\r\ntype, his sons were strong, hardy fellows, who did not know what\r\nsickness meant. His business was prosperous. The Green Cormorant had\r\nthe custom of all the ships, whalers and others, that put in at\r\nKerguelen. Atkins supplied them with everything they required, and\r\nno second inn existed at Christmas Harbour. His sons were\r\ncarpenters, sailmakers, and fishers, and they hunted the amphibians\r\nin all the creeks during the hot season. In short, this was a family\r\nof honest folk who fulfilled their destiny without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n"Once more, Mr. Atkins, let me assure you," I resumed, "I am\r\ndelighted to have come to Kerguelen. I shall always remember the\r\nislands kindly. Nevertheless, I should not be sorry to find myself\r\nat sea again."\r\n\r\n"Come, Mr. Jeorling, you must have a little patience," said the\r\nphilosopher, "you must not forget that the fine days will soon be\r\nhere. In five or six weeks--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and in the meantime, the hills and the plains, the rocks and\r\nthe shores will be covered thick with snow, and the sun will not\r\nhave strength to dispel the mists on the horizon."\r\n\r\n"Now, there you are again, Mr. Jeorling! Why, the wild grass is\r\nalready peeping through the white sheet! Just look!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, with a magnifying glass! Between ourselves, Atkins, could\r\nyou venture to pretend that your bays are not still ice-locked in\r\nthis month of August, which is the February of our northern\r\nhemisphere?"\r\n\r\n"I acknowledge that, Mr. Jeorling. But again I say have patience!\r\nThe winter has been mild this year. The ships will soon show up, in\r\nthe east or in the west, for the fishing season is near."\r\n\r\n"May Heaven hear you, Atkins, and guide the _Halbrane_ safely into\r\nport."\r\n\r\n"Captain Len Guy? Ah, he\'s a good sailor, although he\'s\r\nEnglish--there are good people everywhere--and he takes in his\r\nsupplies at the Green Cormorant."\r\n\r\n"You think the _Halbrane_--"\r\n\r\n"Will be signalled before a week, Mr. Jeorling, or, if not, it\r\nwill be because there is no longer a Captain Len Guy; and if there\r\nis no longer a Captain Len Guy, it is because the _Halbrane_ has sunk\r\nin full sail between the Kerguelens and the Cape of Good Hope."\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr. Atkins walked away, with a scornful gesture,\r\nindicating that such an eventuality was out of all probability.\r\n\r\nMy intention was to take my passage on board the _Halbrane_ so soon as\r\nshe should come to her moorings in Christmas Harbour. After a rest\r\nof six or seven days, she would set sail again for Tristan\r\nd\'Acunha, where she was to discharge her cargo of tin and copper.\r\nI meant to stay in the island for a few weeks of the fine season,\r\nand from thence set out for Connecticut. Nevertheless, I did not\r\nfail to take into due account the share that belongs to chance in\r\nhuman affairs, for it is wise, as Edgar Poe has said, always "to\r\nreckon with the unforeseen, the unexpected, the inconceivable, which\r\nhave a very large share (in those affairs), and chance ought always\r\nto be a matter of strict calculation."\r\n\r\nEach day I walked about the port and its neighbourhood. The sun was\r\ngrowing strong. The rocks were emerging by degrees from their winter\r\nclothing of snow; moss of a wine-like colour was springing up on the\r\nbasalt cliffs, strips of seaweed fifty yards long were floating on\r\nthe sea, and on the plain the lyella, which is of Andean origin, was\r\npushing up its little points, and the only leguminous plant of the\r\nregion, that gigantic cabbage already mentioned, valuable for its\r\nanti-scorbutic properties, was making its appearance.\r\n\r\nI had not come across a single land mammal--sea mammals swarm in\r\nthese waters--not even of the batrachian or reptilian kinds. A few\r\ninsects only--butterflies or others--and even these did not fly,\r\nfor before they could use their wings, the atmospheric currents\r\ncarried the tiny bodies away to the surface of the rolling waves.\r\n\r\n"And the  _Halbrane_?" I used to say to Atkins each morning.\r\n\r\n"The _Halbrane_, Mr. Jeorling," he would reply with complacent\r\nassurance, "will surely come into port to-day, or, if not to-day,\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nIn my rambles on the shore, I frequently routed a crowd of\r\namphibians, sending them plunging into the newly-released waters.\r\nThe penguins, heavy and impassive creatures, did not disappear at my\r\napproach; they took no notice; but the black petrels, the puffins,\r\nblack and white, the grebes and others, spread their wings at sight\r\nof me.\r\n\r\nOne day I witnessed the departure of an albatross, saluted by the\r\nvery best croaks of the penguins, no doubt as a friend whom they\r\nwere to see no more. Those powerful birds can fly for two hundred\r\nleagues without resting for a moment, and with such rapidity that\r\nthey sweep through vast spaces in a few hours. The departing\r\nalbatross sat motionless upon a high rock, at the end of the bay of\r\nChristmas Harbour, looking at the waves as they dashed violently\r\nagainst the beach.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the bird rose with a great sweep into the air, its claws\r\nfolded beneath it, its head stretched out like the prow of a ship,\r\nuttering its shrill cry: a few moments later it was reduced to a\r\nblack speck in the vast height and disappeared behind the misty\r\ncurtain of the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE SCHOONER _HALBRANE_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Halbrane_ was a schooner of three hundred tons, and a fast\r\nsailer. On board there was a captain, a mate, or lieutenant, a\r\nboatswain, a cook, and eight sailors; in all twelve men, a\r\nsufficient number to work the ship. Solidly built, copper-bottomed,\r\nvery manageable, well suited for navigation between the fortieth and\r\nsixtieth parallels of south latitude, the _Halbrane_ was a credit to\r\nthe ship-yards of Birkenhead.\r\n\r\nAll this I learned from Atkins, who adorned his narrative with\r\npraise and admiration of its theme. Captain Len Guy, of Liverpool,\r\nwas three-fifths owner of the vessel, which he had commanded for\r\nnearly six years. He traded in the southern seas of Africa and\r\nAmerica, going from one group of islands to another and from\r\ncontinent to continent. His ship\'s company was but a dozen men, it\r\nis true, but she was used for the purposes of trade only; he would\r\nhave required a more numerous crew, and all the implements, for\r\ntaking seals and other amphibia. The _Halbrane_ was not defenceless,\r\nhowever; on the contrary, she was heavily armed, and this was well,\r\nfor those southern seas were not too safe; they were frequented at\r\nthat period by pirates, and on approaching the isles the _Halbrane_\r\nwas put into a condition to resist attack. Besides, the men always\r\nslept with one eye open.\r\n\r\nOne morning--it was the 27th of August--I was roused out of my bed\r\nby the rough voice of the innkeeper and the tremendous thumps he\r\ngave my door.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling, are you awake?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I am, Atkins. How should I be otherwise, with all that\r\nnoise going on? What\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"A ship six miles out in the offing, to the nor\'east, steering\r\nfor Christmas!"\r\n\r\n"Will it be the _Halbrane_?"\r\n\r\n"We shall know that in a short time, Mr. Jeorling. At any rate it\r\nis the first boat of the year, and we must give it a welcome."\r\n\r\nI dressed hurriedly and joined Atkins on the quay, where I found him\r\nin the midst of a group engaged in eager discussion. Atkins was\r\nindisputably the most considerable and considered man in the\r\narchipelago--consequently he secured the best listeners. The matter\r\nin dispute was whether the schooner in sight was or was not the\r\n_Halbrane_. The majority maintained that she was not, but Atkins was\r\npositive she was, although on this occasion he had only two backers.\r\n\r\nThe dispute was carried on with warmth, the host of the Green\r\nCormorant defending his view, and the dissentients maintaining that\r\nthe fast-approaching schooner was either English or American, until\r\nshe was near enough to hoist her flag and the Union Jack went\r\nfluttering up into the sky. Shortly after the _Halbrane_ lay at anchor\r\nin the middle of Christmas Harbour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The approach of the _Halbrane_.]\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Halbrane_, who received the demonstrative greeting\r\nof Atkins very coolly, it seemed to me, was about forty-five,\r\nred-faced, and solidly built, like his schooner; his head was large,\r\nhis hair was already turning grey, his black eyes shone like coals\r\nof fire under his thick eyebrows, and his strong white teeth were\r\nset like rocks in his powerful jaws; his chin was lengthened by a\r\ncoarse red beard, and his arms and legs were strong and firm. Such\r\nwas Captain Len Guy, and he impressed me with the notion that he was\r\nrather impassive than hard, a shut-up sort of person, whose secrets\r\nit would not be easy to get at. I was told the very same day that my\r\nimpression was correct, by a person who was better informed than\r\nAtkins, although the latter pretended to great intimacy with the\r\ncaptain. The truth was that nobody had penetrated that reserved\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI may as well say at once that the person to whom I have alluded was\r\nthe boatswain of the _Halbrane_, a man named Hurliguerly, who came\r\nfrom the Isle of Wight. This person was about forty-four, short,\r\nstout, strong, and bow-legged; his arms stuck out from his body, his\r\nhead was set like a ball on a bull neck, his chest was broad enough\r\nto hold two pairs of lungs (and he seemed to want a double supply,\r\nfor he was always puffing, blowing, and talking), he had droll\r\nroguish eyes, with a network of wrinkles under them. A noteworthy\r\ndetail was an ear-ring, one only, which hung from the lobe of his\r\nleft ear. What a contrast to the captain of the schooner, and how\r\ndid two such dissimilar beings contrive to get on together? They had\r\ncontrived it, somehow, for they had been at sea in each other\'s\r\ncompany for fifteen years, first in the brig _Power_, which had been\r\nreplaced by the schooner _Halbrane_, six years before the beginning of\r\nthis story.\r\n\r\nAtkins had told Hurliguerly on his arrival that I would take passage\r\non the _Halbrane_, if Captain Len Guy consented to my doing so, and\r\nthe boatswain presented himself on the following morning without any\r\nnotice or introduction. He already knew my name, and he accosted me\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling, I salute you."\r\n\r\n"I salute you in my turn, my friend. What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"To offer you my services."\r\n\r\n"On what account?"\r\n\r\n"On account of your intention to embark on the _Halbrane_."\r\n\r\n"Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"I am Hurliguerly, the boatswain of the _Halbrane_, and besides, I\r\nam the faithful companion of Captain Len Guy, who will listen to me\r\nwillingly, although he has the reputation of not listening to\r\nanybody."\r\n\r\n"Well, my friend, let us talk, if you are not required on board\r\njust now."\r\n\r\n"I have two hours before me, Mr. Jeorling. Besides, there\'s very\r\nlittle to be done to-day. If you are free, as I am--"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand towards the port.\r\n\r\n"Cannot we talk very well here?" I observed.\r\n\r\n"Talk, Mr. Jeorling, talk standing up, and our throats dry, when\r\nit is so easy to sit down in a corner of the Green Cormorant in\r\nfront of two glasses of whisky."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t drink."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I\'ll drink for both of us. Oh! don\'t imagine you\r\nare dealing with a sot! No! never more than is good for me, but\r\nalways as much!"\r\n\r\nI followed the man to the tavern, and while Atkins was busy on the\r\ndeck of the ship, discussing the prices of his purchases and sales,\r\nwe took our places in the eating-room of his inn. And first I said\r\nto Hurliguerly: "It was on Atkins that I reckoned to introduce me\r\nto Captain Len Guy, for he knows him very intimately, if I am not\r\nmistaken."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! Atkins is a good sort, and the captain has an esteem for\r\nhim. But he can\'t do what I can. Let me act for you, Mr.\r\nJeorling."\r\n\r\n"Is it so difficult a matter to arrange, boatswain, and is there\r\nnot a cabin on board the _Halbrane_? The smallest would do for me, and\r\nI will pay--"\r\n\r\n"All right, Mr. Jeorling! There is a cabin, which has never been\r\nused, and since you don\'t mind putting your hand in your pocket if\r\nrequired--however--between ourselves--it will take somebody\r\nsharper than you think, and who isn\'t good old Atkins, to induce\r\nCaptain Len Guy to take a passenger. Yes, indeed, it will take all\r\nthe smartness of the good fellow who now drinks to your health,\r\nregretting that you don\'t return the compliment!"\r\n\r\nWhat a wink it was that accompanied this sentiment! And then the man\r\ntook a short black pipe out of the pocket of his jacket, and smoked\r\nlike a steamer in full blast.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hurliguerly?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"Why does your captain object to taking me on his ship?"\r\n\r\n"Because he does not intend to take anybody on board his ship. He\r\nnever has taken a passenger."\r\n\r\n"But, for what reason, I ask you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! because he wants to go where he likes, to turn about if he\r\npleases and go the other way without accounting for his motives to\r\nanybody. He never leaves these southern seas, Mr. Jeorling; we have\r\nbeen going these many years between Australia on the east and\r\nAmerica on the west; from Hobart Town to the Kerguelens, to Tristan\r\nd\'Acunha, to the Falklands, only taking time anywhere to sell our\r\ncargo, and sometimes dipping down into the Antarctic Sea. Under\r\nthese circumstances, you understand, a passenger might be\r\ntroublesome, and besides, who would care to embark on the _Halbrane_?\r\nshe does not like to flout the breezes, and goes wherever the wind\r\ndrives her."\r\n\r\n"The _Halbrane_ positively leaves the Kerguelens in four days?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"And this time she will sail westward for Tristan d\'Acunha?"\r\n\r\n"Probably."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, that probability will be enough for me, and since you\r\noffer me your services, get Captain Len Guy to accept me as a\r\npassenger."\r\n\r\n"It\'s as good as done."\r\n\r\n"All right, Hurliguerly, and you shall have no reason to repent of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Eh! Mr. Jeorling," replied this singular mariner, shaking his\r\nhead as though he had just come out of the sea, "I have never\r\nrepented of anything, and I know well that I shall not repent of\r\ndoing you a service. Now, if you will allow me, I shall take leave\r\nof you, without waiting for Atkins to return, and get on board."\r\n\r\nWith this, Hurliguerly swallowed his last glass of whisky at a\r\ngulp--I thought the glass would have gone down with the\r\nliquor--bestowed a patronizing smile on me, and departed.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, I met the innkeeper on the port, and told him what\r\nhad occurred.\r\n\r\n"Ah! that Hurliguerly!" said he, "always the old story. If you\r\nwere to believe him, Captain Len Guy wouldn\'t blow his nose\r\nwithout consulting him. He\'s a queer fellow, Mr. Jeorling, not\r\nbad, not stupid, but a great hand at getting hold of dollars or\r\nguineas! If you fall into his hands, mind your purse, button up your\r\npocket, and don\'t let yourself be done."\r\n\r\n"Thanks for your advice, Atkins. Tell me, you have been talking\r\nwith Captain Len Guy; have you spoken about me?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet, Mr. Jeorling. There\'s plenty of time. The _Halbrane_ has\r\nonly just arrived, and--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know. But you understand that I want to be certain as\r\nsoon as possible."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing to fear. The matter will be all right. Besides,\r\nyou would not be at a loss in any case. When the fishing season\r\ncomes, there will be more ships in Christmas Harbour than there are\r\nhouses around the Green Cormorant. Rely on me. I undertake your\r\ngetting a passage."\r\n\r\nNow, these were fair words, but, just as in the case of Hurliguerly,\r\nthere was nothing in them. So, notwithstanding the fine promises of\r\nthe two, I resolved to address myself personally to Len Guy, hard to\r\nget at though he might be, so soon as I should meet him alone.\r\n\r\nThe next day, in the afternoon, I saw him on the quay, and\r\napproached him. It was plain that he would have preferred to avoid\r\nme. It was impossible that Captain Len Guy, who knew every dweller\r\nin the place, should not have known that I was a stranger, even\r\nsupposing that neither of my would-be patrons had mentioned me to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis attitude could only signify one of two things--either my\r\nproposal had been communicated to him, and he did not intend to\r\naccede to it; or neither Hurliguerly nor Atkins had spoken to him\r\nsince the previous day. In the latter case, if he held aloof from\r\nme, it was because of his morose nature; it was because he did not\r\nchoose to enter into conversation with a stranger.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when I was about to accost him, the _Halbrane\'s_\r\nlieutenant rejoined his captain, and the latter availed himself of\r\nthe opportunity to avoid me. He made a sign to the officer to follow\r\nhim, and the two walked away at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\n"This is serious," said I to myself. "It looks as though I\r\nshall find it difficult to gain my point. But, after all it only\r\nmeans delay. To-morrow morning I will go on board the _Halbrane_.\r\nWhether he likes it or whether he doesn\'t, this Len Guy will have\r\nto hear what I\'ve got to say, and to give me an answer, yes or\r\nno!"\r\n\r\nBesides, the captain of the _Halbrane_ might come at dinner-time to\r\nthe Green Cormorant, where the ship\'s people usually took their\r\nmeals when ashore. So I waited, and did not go to dinner until late.\r\nI was disappointed, however, for neither the captain nor anyone\r\nbelonging to the ship patronized the Green Cormorant that day. I had\r\nto dine alone, exactly as I had been doing every day for two months.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, about half-past seven, when it was dark, I went out to\r\nwalk on the port, keeping on the side of the houses. The quay was\r\nquite deserted; not a man of the _Halbrane\'s_ crew was ashore. The\r\nship\'s boats were alongside, rocking gently on the rising tide. I\r\nremained there until nine, walking up and down the edge in full view\r\nof the _Halbrane_. Gradually the mass of the ship became indistinct,\r\nthere was no movement and no light. I returned to the inn, where I\r\nfound Atkins smoking his pipe near the door.\r\n\r\n"Atkins," said I, "it seems that Captain Len Guy does not care\r\nto come to your inn very often?"\r\n\r\n"He sometimes comes on Sunday, and this is Saturday, Mr.\r\nJeorling."\r\n\r\n"You have not spoken to him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have."\r\n\r\nAtkins was visibly embarrassed.\r\n\r\n"You have informed him that a person of your acquaintance wished\r\nto take passage on the _Halbrane_?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What was his answer?"\r\n\r\n"Not what either you or I would have wished, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"He refuses?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, I suppose it was refusing; what he said was: \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nship is not intended to carry passengers. I never have taken any,\r\nand I never intend to do so.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nCAPTAIN LEN GUY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI slept ill. Again and again I "dreamed that I was dreaming."\r\nNow--this is an observation made by Edgar Poe--when one suspects\r\nthat one is dreaming, the waking comes almost instantly. I woke\r\nthen, and every time in a very bad humour with Captain Len Guy. The\r\nidea of leaving the Kerguelens on the _Halbrane_ had full possession\r\nof me, and I grew more and more angry with her disobliging captain.\r\nIn fact, I passed the night in a fever of indignation, and only\r\nrecovered my temper with daylight. Nevertheless I was determined to\r\nhave an explanation with Captain Len Guy about his detestable\r\nconduct. Perhaps I should fail to get anything out of that human\r\nhedgehog, but at least I should have given him a piece of my mind.\r\n\r\nI went out at eight o\'clock in the morning. The weather was\r\nabominable. Rain, mixed with snow, a storm coming over the mountains\r\nat the back of the bay from the west, clouds scurrying down from the\r\nlower zones, an avalanche of wind and water. It was not likely that\r\nCaptain Len Guy had come ashore merely to enjoy such a wetting and\r\nblowing.\r\n\r\nNo one on the quay; of course not. As for my getting on board the\r\n_Halbrane_, that could not be done without hailing one of her boats,\r\nand the boatswain would not venture to send it for me.\r\n\r\n"Besides," I reflected, "on his quarter-deck the captain is at\r\nhome, and neutral ground is better for what I want to say to him, if\r\nhe persists in his unjustifiable refusal. I will watch him this\r\ntime, and if his boat touches the quay, he shall not succeed in\r\navoiding me."\r\n\r\nI returned to the Green Cormorant, and took up my post behind the\r\nwindow panes, which were dimmed by the hissing rain. There I waited,\r\nnervous, impatient, and in a state of growing irritation. Two hours\r\nwore away thus. Then, with the instability of the winds in the\r\nKerguelens, the weather became calm before I did. I opened my\r\nwindow, and at the same moment a sailor stepped into one of the\r\nboats of the _Halbrane_ and laid hold of a pair of oars, while a\r\nsecond man seated himself in the back, but without taking the tiller\r\nropes. The boat touched the landing-place and Captain Len Guy\r\nstepped on shore.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds I was out of the inn, and confronted him.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said I in a cold hard tone.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy looked at me steadily, and I was struck by the\r\nsadness of his eyes, which were as black as ink. Then in a very low\r\nvoice he asked:\r\n\r\n"You are a stranger?"\r\n\r\n"A stranger at the Kerguelens? Yes."\r\n\r\n"Of English nationality?"\r\n\r\n"No. American."\r\n\r\nHe saluted me, and I returned the curt gesture.\r\n\r\n"Sir," I resumed, "I believe Mr. Atkins of the Green Cormorant\r\nhas spoken to you respecting a proposal of mine. That proposal, it\r\nseems to me, deserved a favourable reception on the part of a--"\r\n\r\n"The proposal to take passage on my ship?" interposed Captain\r\nLen Guy.\r\n\r\n"Precisely."\r\n\r\n"I regret, sir, I regret that I could not agree to your request."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am not in the habit of taking passengers. That is the\r\nfirst reason."\r\n\r\n"And the second, captain?"\r\n\r\n"Because the route of the _Halbrane_ is never settled beforehand.\r\nShe starts for one port and goes to another, just as I find it to my\r\nadvantage. You must know that I am not in the service of a\r\nshipowner. My share in the schooner is considerable, and I have no\r\none but myself to consult in respect to her."\r\n\r\n"Then it entirely depends on you to give me a passage?"\r\n\r\n"That is so, but I can only answer you by a refusal--to my\r\nextreme regret."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will change your mind, captain, when you know that I\r\ncare very little what the destination of your schooner may be. It is\r\nnot unreasonable to suppose that she will go somewhere--"\r\n\r\n"Somewhere indeed." I fancied that Captain Len Guy threw a long\r\nlook towards the southern horizon.\r\n\r\n"To go here or to go there is almost a matter of indifference to\r\nme. What I desired above all was to get away from Kerguelen at the\r\nfirst opportunity that should offer."\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy made me no answer; he remained in silent thought,\r\nbut did not endeavour to slip away from me.\r\n\r\n"You are doing me the honour to listen to me?" I asked him\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"I will then add that, if I am not mistaken, and if the route of\r\nyour ship has not been altered, it was your intention to leave\r\nChristmas Harbour for Tristan d\'Acunha."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps for Tristan d\'Acunha, perhaps for the Cape, perhaps for\r\nthe Falklands, perhaps for elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Captain Guy, it is precisely elsewhere that I want to\r\ngo," I replied ironically, and trying hard to control my\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nThen a singular change took place in the demeanour of Captain Len\r\nGuy. His voice became more sharp and harsh. In very plain words he\r\nmade me understand that it was quite useless to insist, that our\r\ninterview had already lasted too long, that time pressed, and he had\r\nbusiness at the port; in short that we had said all that we could\r\nhave to say to each other.\r\n\r\nI had put out my arm to detain him--to seize him would be a more\r\ncorrect term--and the conversation, ill begun, seemed likely to end\r\nstill more ill, when this odd person turned towards me and said in a\r\nmilder tone,--\r\n\r\n"Pray understand, sir, that I am very sorry to be unable to do\r\nwhat you ask, and to appear disobliging to an American. But I could\r\nnot act otherwise. In the course of the voyage of the _Halbrane_ some\r\nunforeseen incident might occur to make the presence of a passenger\r\ninconvenient--even one so accommodating as yourself. Thus I might\r\nexpose myself to the risk of being unable to profit by the chances\r\nwhich I seek."\r\n\r\n"I have told you, captain, and I repeat it, that although my\r\nintention is to return to America and to Connecticut, I don\'t care\r\nwhether I get there in three months or in six, or by what route;\r\nit\'s all the same to me, and even were your schooner to take me to\r\nthe Antarctic seas--"\r\n\r\n"The Antarctic seas!" exclaimed Captain Len Guy, with a question\r\nin his tone. And his look searched my thoughts with the keenness of\r\na dagger.\r\n\r\n"Why do you speak of the Antarctic seas?" he asked, taking my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Well, just as I might have spoken of the \xe2\x80\x98Hyperborean seas\'\r\nfrom whence an Irish poet has made Sebastian Cabot address some\r\nlovely verses to his Lady.(1) I spoke of the South Pole as I might\r\nhave spoken of the North."\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy did not answer, and I thought I saw tears glisten in\r\nhis eyes. Then, as though he would escape from some harrowing\r\nrecollection which my words had evoked, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Who would venture to seek the South Pole?"\r\n\r\n"It would be difficult to reach, and the experiments would be of\r\nno practical use," I replied. "Nevertheless there are men\r\nsufficiently adventurous to embark in such an enterprise."\r\n\r\n"Yes--adventurous is the word!" muttered the captain.\r\n\r\n"And now," I resumed, "the United States is again making an\r\nattempt with Wilkes\'s fleet, the _Vancouver_, the _Peacock_, the\r\n_Flying Fish_, and others."\r\n\r\n"The United States, Mr. Jeorling? Do you mean to say that an\r\nexpedition has been sent by the Federal Government to the Antarctic\r\nseas?"\r\n\r\n"The fact is certain, and last year, before I left America, I\r\nlearned that the vessels had sailed. That was a year ago, and it is\r\nvery possible that Wilkes has gone farther than any of the preceding\r\nexplorers."\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy had relapsed into silence, and came out of his\r\ninexplicable musing only to say abruptly,--\r\n\r\n"You come from Connecticut, sir?"\r\n\r\n"From Connecticut."\r\n\r\n"And more specially?"\r\n\r\n"From Providence."\r\n\r\n"Do you know Nantucket Island?"\r\n\r\n"I have visited it several times."\r\n\r\n"You know, I think," said the captain, looking straight into my\r\neyes, "that Nantucket Island was the birthplace of Arthur Gordon\r\nPym, the hero of your famous romance-writer Edgar Poe."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I remember that Poe\'s romance starts from Nantucket."\r\n\r\n"Romance, you say? That was the word you used?"\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly, captain."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and that is what everybody says! But, pardon me, I cannot\r\nstay any longer. I regret that I cannot alter my mind with respect\r\nto your proposal. But, at any rate, you will only have a few days to\r\nwait. The season is about to open. Trading ships and whalers will\r\nput in at Christmas Harbour, and you will be able to make a choice,\r\nwith the certainty of going to the port you want to reach. I am very\r\nsorry, sir, and I salute you."\r\n\r\nWith these words Captain Len Guy walked quickly away, and the\r\ninterview ended differently from what I had expected, that is to say\r\nin formal, although polite, fashion.\r\n\r\nAs there is no use in contending with the impossible, I gave up the\r\nhope of a passage on the _Halbrane_, but continued to feel angry with\r\nher intractable captain. And why should I not confess that my\r\ncuriosity was aroused? I felt that there was something mysterious\r\nabout this sullen mariner, and I should have liked to find out what\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nThat day, Atkins wanted to know whether Captain Len Guy had made\r\nhimself less disagreeable. I had to acknowledge that I had been no\r\nmore fortunate in my negotiations than my host himself, and the\r\navowal surprised him not a little. He could not understand the\r\ncaptain\'s obstinate refusal. And--a fact which touched him more\r\nnearly--the Green Cormorant had not been visited by either Len Guy\r\nor his crew since the arrival of the _Halbrane_. The men were\r\nevidently acting upon orders. So far as Hurliguerly was concerned,\r\nit was easy to understand that after his imprudent advance he did\r\nnot care to keep up useless relations with me. I knew not whether he\r\nhad attempted to shake the resolution of his chief; but I was\r\ncertain of one thing; if he had made any such effort it had failed.\r\n\r\nDuring the three following days, the 10th, 11th, and 12th of August,\r\nthe work of repairing and re-victualling the schooner went on\r\nbriskly; but all this was done with regularity, and without such\r\nnoise and quarrelling as seamen at anchor usually indulge in. The\r\n_Halbrane_ was evidently well commanded, her crew well kept in hand,\r\ndiscipline strictly maintained.\r\n\r\nThe schooner was to sail on the 15th of August, and on the eve of\r\nthat day I had no reason to think that Captain Len Guy had repented\r\nhim of his categorical refusal. Indeed, I had made up my mind to the\r\ndisappointment, and had no longer any angry feeling about it. When\r\nCaptain Len Guy and myself met on the quay, we took no notice of\r\neach other; nevertheless, I fancied there was some hesitation in his\r\nmanner; as though he would have liked to speak to me. He did not do\r\nso, however, and I was not disposed to seek a further explanation.\r\n\r\nAt seven o\'clock in the evening of the 14th of August, the island\r\nbeing already wrapped in darkness, I was walking on the port after I\r\nhad dined, walking briskly too, for it was cold, although dry\r\nweather. The sky was studded with stars and the air was very keen. I\r\ncould not stay out long, and was returning to mine inn, when a man\r\ncrossed my path, paused, came back, and stopped in front of me. It\r\nwas the captain of the _Halbrane_.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling," he began, "the _Halbrane_ sails to-morrow\r\nmorning, with the ebb tide."\r\n\r\n"What is the good of telling me that," I replied, "since you\r\nrefuse--"\r\n\r\n"Sir, I have thought over it, and if you have not changed your\r\nmind, come on board at seven o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Really, captain," I replied, "I did not expect this relenting\r\non your part."\r\n\r\n"I repeat that I have thought over it, and I add that the _Halbrane_\r\nshall proceed direct to Tristan d\'Acunha. That will suit you, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"To perfection, captain. To-morrow morning, at seven o\'clock, I\r\nshall be on board."\r\n\r\n"Your cabin is prepared."\r\n\r\n"The cost of the voyage--"\r\n\r\n"We can settle that another time," answered the captain, "and\r\nto your satisfaction. Until to-morrow, then--"\r\n\r\n"Until to-morrow."\r\n\r\nI stretched out my arm, to shake hands with him upon our bargain.\r\nPerhaps he did not perceive my movement in the darkness, at all\r\nevents he made no response to it, but walked rapidly away and got\r\ninto his boat.\r\n\r\nI was greatly surprised, and so was Atkins, when I found him in the\r\neating-room of the Green Cormorant and told him what had occurred.\r\nHis comment upon it was characteristic.\r\n\r\n"This queer captain," he said, "is as full of whims as a\r\nspoilt child! It is to be hoped he will not change his mind again at\r\nthe last moment."\r\n\r\nThe next morning at daybreak I bade adieu to the Green Cormorant,\r\nand went down to the port, with my kind-hearted host, who insisted\r\non accompanying me to the ship, partly in order to make his mind\r\neasy respecting the sincerity of the captain\'s repentance, and\r\npartly that he might take leave of him, and also of Hurliguerly. A\r\nboat was waiting at the quay, and we reached the ship in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe first person whom I met on the deck was Hurliguerly; he gave me\r\na look of triumph, which said as plainly as speech: "Ha! you see\r\nnow. Our hard-to-manage captain has given in at last. And to whom do\r\nyou owe this, but to the good boatswain who did his best for you,\r\nand did not boast overmuch of his influence?"\r\n\r\nWas this the truth? I had strong reasons for doubting it. After all,\r\nwhat did it matter?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Going aboard the _Halbrane_.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy came on deck immediately after my arrival; this was\r\nnot surprising, except for the fact that he did not appear to remark\r\nmy presence.\r\n\r\nAtkins then approached the captain and said in a pleasant tone,--\r\n\r\n"We shall meet next year!"\r\n\r\n"If it please God, Atkins."\r\n\r\nThey shook hands. Then the boatswain took a hearty leave of the\r\ninnkeeper, and was rowed back to the quay.\r\n\r\nBefore dark the white summits of Table Mount and Havergal, which\r\nrise, the former to two, the other to three thousand feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, had disappeared from our view.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Thomas D\'Arcy McGee. (J.V.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nFROM THE KERGUELEN ISLES TO PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever did a voyage begin more prosperously, or a passenger start in\r\nbetter spirits. The interior of the _Halbrane_ corresponded with its\r\nexterior. Nothing could exceed the perfect order, the Dutch\r\ncleanliness of the vessel. The captain\'s cabin, and that of the\r\nlieutenant, one on the port, the other on the starboard side, were\r\nfitted up with a narrow berth, a cupboard anything but capacious, an\r\narm-chair, a fixed table, a lamp hung from the ceiling, various\r\nnautical instruments, a barometer, a thermometer, a chronometer, and\r\na sextant in its oaken box. One of the two other cabins was prepared\r\nto receive me. It was eight feet in length, five in breadth. I was\r\naccustomed to the exigencies of sea life, and could do with its\r\nnarrow proportions, also with its furniture--a table, a cupboard, a\r\ncane-bottomed arm-chair, a washing-stand on an iron pedestal, and a\r\nberth to which a less accommodating passenger would doubtless have\r\nobjected. The passage would be a short one, however, so I took\r\npossession of that cabin, which I was to occupy for only four, or at\r\nthe worst five weeks, with entire content.\r\n\r\nThe eight men who composed the crew were named respectively Martin\r\nHolt, sailing-master; Hardy, Rogers, Drap, Francis, Gratian, Burg,\r\nand Stern--sailors all between twenty-five and thirty-five years\r\nold--all Englishmen, well trained, and remarkably well disciplined\r\nby a hand of iron.\r\n\r\nLet me set it down here at the beginning, the exceptionally able man\r\nwhom they all obeyed at a word, a gesture, was not the captain of\r\nthe _Halbrane_; that man was the second officer, James West, who was\r\nthen thirty-two years of age.\r\n\r\nJames West was born on the sea, and had passed his childhood on\r\nboard a lighter belonging to his father, and on which the whole\r\nfamily lived. All his life he had breathed the salt air of the\r\nEnglish Channel, the Atlantic, or the Pacific. He never went ashore\r\nexcept for the needs of his service, whether of the State or of\r\ntrade. If he had to leave one ship for another he merely shifted his\r\ncanvas bag to the latter, from which he stirred no more. When he was\r\nnot sailing in reality he was sailing in imagination. After having\r\nbeen ship\'s boy, novice, sailor, he became quartermaster, master,\r\nand finally lieutenant of the _Halbrane_, and he had already served\r\nfor ten years as second in command under Captain Len Guy.\r\n\r\nJames West was not even ambitious of a higher rise; he did not want\r\nto make a fortune; he did not concern himself with the buying or\r\nselling of cargoes; but everything connected with that admirable\r\ninstrument a sailing ship, James West understood to perfection.\r\n\r\nThe personal appearance of the lieutenant was as follows: middle\r\nheight, slightly built, all nerves and muscles, strong limbs as\r\nagile as those of a gymnast, the true sailor\'s "look," but of\r\nvery unusual far-sightedness and surprising penetration, sunburnt\r\nface, hair thick and short, beardless cheeks and chin, regular\r\nfeatures, the whole expression denoting energy, courage, and\r\nphysical strength at their utmost tension.\r\n\r\nJames West spoke but rarely--only when he was questioned. He gave\r\nhis orders in a clear voice, not repeating them, but so as to be\r\nheard at once, and he was understood. I call attention to this\r\ntypical officer of the Merchant Marine, who was devoted body and\r\nsoul to Captain Len Guy as to the schooner _Halbrane_. He seemed to be\r\none of the essential organs of his ship, and if the _Halbrane_ had a\r\nheart it was in James West\'s breast that it beat.\r\n\r\nThere is but one more person to be mentioned; the ship\'s cook--a\r\nnegro from the African coast named Endicott, thirty years of age,\r\nwho had held that post for eight years. The boatswain and he were\r\ngreat friends, and indulged in frequent talks.\r\n\r\nLife on board was very regular, very simple, and its monotony was\r\nnot without a certain charm. Sailing is repose in movement, a\r\nrocking in a dream, and I did not dislike my isolation. Of course I\r\nshould have liked to find out why Captain Len Guy had changed his\r\nmind with respect to me; but how was this to be done? To question\r\nthe lieutenant would have been loss of time. Besides, was he in\r\npossession of the secrets of his chief? It was no part of his\r\nbusiness to be so, and I had observed that he did not occupy himself\r\nwith anything outside of it. Not ten words were exchanged between\r\nhim and me during the two meals which we took in common daily. I\r\nmust acknowledge, however, that I frequently caught the captain\'s\r\neyes fixed upon me, as though he longed to question me, as though he\r\nhad something to learn from me, whereas it was I, on the contrary,\r\nwho had something to learn from him. But we were both silent.\r\n\r\nHad I felt the need of talking to somebody very strongly, I might\r\nhave resorted to the boatswain, who was always disposed to chatter;\r\nbut what had he to say that could interest me? He never failed to\r\nbid me good morning and good evening in most prolix fashion, but\r\nbeyond these courtesies I did not feel disposed to go.\r\n\r\nThe good weather lasted, and on the 18th of August, in the\r\nafternoon, the look-out discerned the mountains of the Crozet group.\r\nThe next day we passed Possession Island, which is inhabited only in\r\nthe fishing season. At this period the only dwellers there are\r\nflocks of penguins, and the birds which whalers call "white\r\npigeons."\r\n\r\nThe approach to land is always interesting at sea. It occurred to me\r\nthat Captain Len Guy might take this opportunity of speaking to his\r\npassenger; but he did not.\r\n\r\nWe should see land, that is to say the peaks of Marion and Prince\r\nEdward Islands, before arriving at Tristan d\'Acunha, but it was\r\nthere the _Halbrane_ was to take in a fresh supply of water. I\r\nconcluded therefore that the monotony of our voyage would continue\r\nunbroken to the end. But, on the morning of the 20th of August, to\r\nmy extreme surprise, Captain Len Guy came on deck, approached me,\r\nand said, speaking very low,--\r\n\r\n"Sir, I have something to say to you."\r\n\r\n"I am ready to hear you, captain."\r\n\r\n"I have not spoken until to-day, for I am naturally taciturn."\r\nHere he hesitated again, but after a pause, continued with an\r\neffort,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling, have you tried to discover my reason for changing\r\nmy mind on the subject of your passage?"\r\n\r\n"I have tried, but I have not succeeded, captain. Perhaps, as I am\r\nnot a compatriot of yours, you--"\r\n\r\n"It is precisely because you are an American that I decided in the\r\nend to offer you a passage on the _Halbrane_."\r\n\r\n"Because I am an American?"\r\n\r\n"Also, because you come from Connecticut."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"You will understand if I add that I thought it possible, since\r\nyou belong to Connecticut, since you have visited Nantucket Island,\r\nthat you might have known the family of Arthur Gordon Pym."\r\n\r\n"The hero of Edgar Poe\'s romance?"\r\n\r\n"The same. His narrative was founded upon the manuscript in which\r\nthe details of that extraordinary and disastrous voyage across the\r\nAntarctic Sea was related."\r\n\r\nI thought I must be dreaming when I heard Captain Len Guy\'s words.\r\nEdgar Poe\'s romance was nothing but a fiction, a work of\r\nimagination by the most brilliant of our American writers. And here\r\nwas a sane man treating that fiction as a reality.\r\n\r\nI could not answer him. I was asking myself what manner of man was\r\nthis one with whom I had to deal.\r\n\r\n"You have heard my question?" persisted the captain.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, captain, certainly, but I am not sure that I quite\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"I will put it to you more plainly. I ask you whether in\r\nConnecticut you personally knew the Pym family who lived in\r\nNantucket Island? Arthur Pam\'s father was one of the principal\r\nmerchants there, he was a Navy contractor. It was his son who\r\nembarked in the adventures which he related with his own lips to\r\nEdgar Poe--"\r\n\r\n"Captain! Why, that story is due to the powerful imagination of\r\nour great poet. It is a pure invention."\r\n\r\n"So, then, you don\'t believe it, Mr. Jeorling?" said the\r\ncaptain, shrugging his shoulders three times.\r\n\r\n"Neither I nor any other person believes it, Captain Guy, and you\r\nare the first I have heard maintain that it was anything but a mere\r\nromance."\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, then, Mr. Jeorling, for although this\r\n\xe2\x80\x98romance\'--as you call it--appeared only last year, it is none\r\nthe less a reality. Although eleven years have elapsed since the\r\nfacts occurred, they are none the less true, and we still await the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98word\' of an enigma which will perhaps never be solved."\r\n\r\nYes, he was mad; but by good fortune West was there to take his\r\nplace as commander of the schooner. I had only to listen to him, and\r\nas I had read Poe\'s romance over and over again, I was curious to\r\nhear what the captain had to say about it.\r\n\r\n"And now," he resumed in a sharper tone and with a shake in his\r\nvoice which denoted a certain amount of nervous irritation, "it is\r\npossible that you did not know the Pym family, that you have never\r\nmet them either at Providence or at Nantucket--"\r\n\r\n"Or elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"Just so! But don\'t commit yourself by asserting that the Pym\r\nfamily never existed, that Arthur Gordon is only a fictitious\r\npersonage, and his voyage an imaginary one! Do you think any man,\r\neven your Edgar Poe, could have been capable of inventing, of\r\ncreating--?"\r\n\r\nThe increasing vehemence of Captain Len Guy warned me of the\r\nnecessity of treating his monomania with respect, and accepting all\r\nhe said without discussion.\r\n\r\n"Now," he proceeded, "please to keep the facts which I am\r\nabout to state clearly in your mind; there is no disputing about\r\nfacts. You may deduce any results from them you like. I hope you\r\nwill not make me regret that I consented to give you a passage on\r\nthe _Halbrane_."\r\n\r\nThis was an effectual warning, so I made a sign of acquiescence. The\r\nmatter promised to be curious. He went on,--\r\n\r\n"When Edgar Poe\'s narrative appeared in 1838, I was at New York.\r\nI immediately started for Baltimore, where the writer\'s family\r\nlived; the grandfather had served as quarter-master-general during\r\nthe War of Independence. You admit, I suppose, the existence of the\r\nPoe family, although you deny that of the Pym family?"\r\n\r\nI said nothing, and the captain continued, with a dark glance at\r\nme,--\r\n\r\n"I inquired into certain matters relating to Edgar Poe. His abode\r\nwas pointed out to me and I called at the house. A first\r\ndisappointment! He had left America, and I could not see him.\r\nUnfortunately, being unable to see Edgar Poe, I was unable to refer\r\nto Arthur Gordon Pym in the case. That bold pioneer of the Antarctic\r\nregions was dead! As the American poet had stated, at the close of\r\nthe narrative of his adventures, Gordon\'s death had already been\r\nmade known to the public by the daily press."\r\n\r\nWhat Captain Len Guy said was true; but, in common with all the\r\nreaders of the romance, I had taken this declaration for an artifice\r\nof the novelist. My notion was that, as he either could not or dared\r\nnot wind up so extraordinary a work of imagination, Poe had given it\r\nto be understood that he had not received the last three chapters\r\nfrom Arthur Pym, whose life had ended under sudden and deplorable\r\ncircumstances which Poe did not make known.\r\n\r\n"Then," continued the captain, "Edgar Poe being absent, Arthur\r\nPym being dead, I had only one thing to do; to find the man who had\r\nbeen the fellow-traveller of Arthur Pym, that Dirk Peters who had\r\nfollowed him to the very verge of the high latitudes, and whence\r\nthey had both returned--how? This is not known. Did they come back\r\nin company? The narrative does not say, and there are obscure points\r\nin that part of it, as in many other places. However, Edgar Poe\r\nstated explicitly that Dirk Peters would be able to furnish\r\ninformation relating to the non-communicated chapters, and that he\r\nlived at Illinois. I set out at once for Illinois; I arrived at\r\nSpringfield; I inquired for this man, a half-breed Indian. He lived\r\nin the hamlet of Vandalia; I went there, and met with a second\r\ndisappointment. He was not there, or rather, Mr. Jeorling, he was _no\r\nlonger_ there. Some years before this Dirk Peters had left Illinois,\r\nand even the United States, to go--nobody knows where. But I have\r\ntalked, at Vandalia with people who had known him, with whom he\r\nlived, to whom he related his adventures, but did not explain the\r\nfinal issue. Of that he alone holds the secret."\r\n\r\nWhat! This Dirk Peters had really existed? He still lived? I was\r\non the point of letting myself be carried away by the statements of\r\nthe captain of the _Halbrane_! Yes, another moment, and, in my turn, I\r\nshould have made a fool of myself. This poor mad fellow imagined\r\nthat he had gone to Illinois and seen people at Vandalia who had\r\nknown Dirk Peters, and that the latter had disappeared. No wonder,\r\nsince he had never existed, save in the brain of the novelist!\r\n\r\nNevertheless I did not want to vex Len Guy, and perhaps drive him\r\nstill more mad. Accordingly I appeared entirely convinced that he\r\nwas speaking words of sober seriousness, even when he added,--\r\n\r\n"You are aware that in the narrative mention is made by the\r\ncaptain of the schooner on which Arthur Pym had embarked, of a\r\nbottle containing a sealed letter, which was deposited at the foot\r\nof one of the Kerguelen peaks?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I recall the incident."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, in one of my latest voyages I sought for the place\r\nwhere that bottle ought to be. I found it and the letter also. That\r\nletter stated that the captain and Arthur Pym intended to make every\r\neffort to reach the uttermost limits of the Antarctic Sea!"\r\n\r\n"You found that bottle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes!"\r\n\r\n"And the letter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes!"\r\n\r\nI looked at Captain Len Guy. Like certain monomaniacs he had come to\r\nbelieve in his own inventions. I was on the point of saying to him,\r\n"Show me that letter," but I thought better of it. Was he not\r\ncapable of having written the letter himself? And then I answered,--\r\n\r\n"It is much to be regretted, captain, that you were unable to come\r\nacross Dirk Peters at Vandalia! He would at least have informed you\r\nunder what conditions he and Arthur Pym returned from so far.\r\nRecollect, now, in the last chapter but one they are both there.\r\nTheir boat is in front of the thick curtain of white mist; it dashes\r\ninto the gulf of the cataract just at the moment when a veiled human\r\nform rises. Then there is nothing more; nothing but two blank\r\nlines--"\r\n\r\n"Decidedly, sir, it _is_ much to be regretted that I could not lay\r\nmy hand on Dirk Peters! It would have been interesting to learn what\r\nwas the outcome of these adventures. But, to my mind, it would have\r\nbeen still more interesting to have ascertained the fate of the\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n"The others?" I exclaimed almost involuntarily. "Of whom do\r\nyou speak?"\r\n\r\n"Of the captain and crew of the English schooner which picked up\r\nArthur Pym and Dirk Peters after the frightful shipwreck of the\r\n_Grampus_, and brought them across the Polar Sea to Tsalal Island--"\r\n\r\n"Captain," said I, just as though I entertained no doubt of the\r\nauthenticity of Edgar Poe\'s romance, "is it not the case that\r\nall these men perished, some in the attack on the schooner, the\r\nothers by the infernal device of the natives of Tsalal?"\r\n\r\n"Who can tell?" replied the captain in a voice hoarse from\r\nemotion. "Who can say but that some of the unfortunate creatures\r\nsurvived, and contrived to escape from the natives?"\r\n\r\n"In any case," I replied, "it would be difficult to admit that\r\nthose who had survived could still be living."\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"Because the facts we are discussing are eleven years old."\r\n\r\n"Sir," replied the captain, "since Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters\r\nwere able to advance beyond Tsalal Island farther than the\r\neighty-third parallel, since they found means of living in the midst\r\nof those Antarctic lands, why should not their companions, if they\r\nwere not all killed by the natives, if they were so fortunate as to\r\nreach the neighbouring islands sighted during the voyage--why\r\nshould not those unfortunate countrymen of mine have contrived to\r\nlive there? Why should they not still be there, awaiting their\r\ndeliverance?"\r\n\r\n"Your pity leads you astray, captain," I replied. "It would\r\nbe impossible."\r\n\r\n"Impossible, sir! And if a fact, on indisputable evidence,\r\nappealed to the whole civilized world; if a material proof of the\r\nexistence of these unhappy men, imprisoned at the ends of the earth,\r\nwere furnished, who would venture to meet those who would fain go to\r\ntheir aid with the cry of \xe2\x80\x98Impossible!\'"\r\n\r\nWas it a sentiment of humanity, exaggerated to the point of madness,\r\nthat had roused the interest of this strange man in those\r\nshipwrecked folk who never had suffered shipwreck, for the good\r\nreason that they never had existed?\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy approached me anew, laid his hand on my shoulder and\r\nwhispered in my ear,--\r\n\r\n"No, sir, no! the last word has not been said concerning the crew\r\nof the _Jane_."\r\n\r\nThen he promptly withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe _Jane_ was, in Edgar Poe\'s romance, the name of the ship which\r\nhad rescued Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters from the wreck of the\r\n_Grampus_, and Captain Len Guy had now uttered it for the first time.\r\nIt occurred to me then that Guy was the name of the captain of the\r\n_Jane_, an English ship; but what of that? The captain of the _Jane_\r\nnever lived but in the imagination of the novelist, he and the\r\nskipper of the _Halbrane_ have nothing in common except a name which\r\nis frequently to be found in England. But, on thinking of the\r\nsimilarity, it struck me that the poor captain\'s brain had been\r\nturned by this very thing. He had conceived the notion that he was\r\nof kin to the unfortunate captain of the _Jane_! And this had brought\r\nhim to his present state, this was the source of his passionate pity\r\nfor the fate of the imaginary shipwrecked mariners!\r\n\r\nIt would have been interesting to discover whether James West was\r\naware of the state of the case, whether his chief had ever talked to\r\nhim of the follies he had revealed to me. But this was a delicate\r\nquestion, since it involved the mental condition of Captain Len Guy;\r\nand besides, any kind of conversation with the lieutenant was\r\ndifficult. On the whole I thought it safer to restrain my curiosity.\r\nIn a few days the schooner would reach Tristan d\'Acunha, and I\r\nshould part with her and her captain for good and all. Never,\r\nhowever, could I lose the recollection that I had actually met and\r\nsailed with a man who took the fictions of Edgar Poe\'s romance for\r\nsober fact. Never could I have looked for such an experience!\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of August the outline of Prince Edward\'s Island was\r\nsighted, south latitude 46\xc2\xb0 55\', and 37\xc2\xb0 46\' east longitude.\r\nWe were in sight of the island for twelve hours, and then it was\r\nlost in the evening mists.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the _Halbrane_ headed in the direction of the\r\nnorth-west, towards the most northern parallel of the southern\r\nhemisphere which she had to attain in the course of that voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nEDGAR POE\'S ROMANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I have to give a brief summary of Edgar Poe\'s\r\nromance, which was published at Richmond under the title of\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF ARTHUR GORDON PYM.\r\n\r\nWe shall see whether there was any room for doubt that the\r\nadventures of this hero of romance were imaginary. But indeed, among\r\nthe multitude of Poe\'s readers, was there ever one, with the sole\r\nexception of Len Guy, who believed them to be real? The story is\r\ntold by the principal personage. Arthur Pym states in the preface\r\nthat on his return from his voyage to the Antarctic seas he met,\r\namong the Virginian gentlemen who took an interest in geographical\r\ndiscoveries, Edgar Poe, who was then editor of the _Southern Literary\r\nMessenger_ at Richmond, and that he authorized the latter to publish\r\nthe first part of his adventures in that journal "under the cloak\r\nof fiction." That portion having been favourably received, a\r\nvolume containing the complete narrative was issued with the\r\nsignature of Edgar Poe.\r\n\r\nArthur Gordon Pym was born at Nantucket, where he attended the\r\nBedford School until he was sixteen years old. Having left that\r\nschool for Mr. Ronald\'s, he formed a friendship with one Augustus\r\nBarnard, the son of a ship\'s captain. This youth, who was\r\neighteen, had already accompanied his father on a whaling expedition\r\nin the southern seas, and his yarns concerning that maritime\r\nadventure fired the imagination of Arthur Pym. Thus it was that the\r\nassociation of these youths gave rise to Pym\'s irresistible\r\nvocation to adventurous voyaging, and to the instinct that\r\nespecially attracted him towards the high zones of the Antarctic\r\nregion. The first exploit of Augustus Barnard and Arthur Pym was an\r\nexcursion on board a little sloop, the _Ariel_, a two-decked boat\r\nwhich belonged to the Pyms. One evening the two youths, both being\r\nvery tipsy, embarked secretly, in cold October weather, and boldly\r\nset sail in a strong breeze from the south-west. The _Ariel_, aided by\r\nthe ebb tide, had already lost sight of land when a violent storm\r\narose. The imprudent young fellows were still intoxicated. No one\r\nwas at the helm, not a reef was in the sail. The masts were carried\r\naway by the furious gusts, and the wreck was driven before the wind.\r\nThen came a great ship which passed over the _Ariel_ as the _Ariel_\r\nwould have passed over a floating feather.\r\n\r\nArthur Pym gives the fullest details of the rescue of his companion\r\nand himself after this collision, under conditions of extreme\r\ndifficulty. At length, thanks to the second officer of the _Penguin_,\r\nfrom New London, which arrived on the scene of the catastrophe, the\r\ncomrades were picked up, with life all but extinct, and taken back to\r\nNantucket.\r\n\r\nThis adventure, to which I cannot deny an appearance of veracity, was\r\nan ingenious preparation for the chapters that were to follow, and\r\nindeed, up to the day on which Pym penetrates into the polar circle,\r\nthe narrative might conceivably be regarded as authentic. But,\r\nbeyond the polar circle, above the austral icebergs, it is quite\r\nanother thing, and, if the author\'s work be not one of pure\r\nimagination, I am--well, of any other nationality than my own. Let\r\nus get on.\r\n\r\nTheir first adventure had not cooled the two youths, and eight\r\nmonths after the affair of the _Ariel_--June, 1827--the brig\r\n_Grampus_ was fitted out by the house of Lloyd and Vredenburg for\r\nwhaling in the southern seas. This brig was an old, ill-repaired\r\ncraft, and Mr. Barnard, the father of Augustus, was its skipper. His\r\nson, who was to accompany him on the voyage, strongly urged Arthur\r\nto go with him, and the latter would have asked nothing better, but\r\nhe knew that his family, and especially his mother, would never\r\nconsent to let him go.\r\n\r\nThis obstacle, however, could not stop a youth not much given to\r\nsubmit to the wishes of his parents. His head was full of the\r\nentreaties and persuasion of his companion, and he determined to\r\nembark secretly on the _Grampus_, for Mr. Barnard would not have\r\nauthorized him to defy the prohibition of his family. He announced\r\nthat he had been invited to pass a few days with a friend at New\r\nBedford, took leave of his parents and left his home. Forty-eight\r\nhours before the brig was to sail, he slipped on board unperceived,\r\nand got into a hiding-place which had been prepared for him unknown\r\nalike to Mr. Barnard and the crew.\r\n\r\nThe cabin occupied by Augustus communicated by a trap-door with the\r\nhold of the _Grampus_, which was crowded with barrels, bales, and the\r\ninnumerable components of a cargo. Through the trap-door Arthur Pym\r\nreached his hiding-place, which was a huge wooden chest with a\r\nsliding side to it. This chest contained a mattress, blankets, a jar\r\nof water, ship\'s biscuit, smoked sausage, a roast quarter of\r\nmutton, a few bottles of cordials and liqueurs, and also\r\nwriting-materials. Arthur Pym, supplied with a lantern, candles, and\r\ntinder, remained three days and nights in his retreat. Augustus\r\nBarnard had not been able to visit him until just before the _Grampus_\r\nset sail.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Arthur Pym began to feel the rolling and pitching of\r\nthe brig. He was very uncomfortable in the chest, so he got out of\r\nit, and in the dark, while holding on by a rope which was stretched\r\nacross the hold to the trap of his friend\'s cabin, he was\r\nviolently sea-sick in the midst of the chaos. Then he crept back\r\ninto his chest, ate, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nSeveral days elapsed without the reappearance of Augustus Barnard.\r\nEither he had not been able to get down into the hold again, or he\r\nhad not ventured to do so, fearing to betray the presence of Arthur\r\nPym, and thinking the moment for confessing everything to his father\r\nhad not yet come.\r\n\r\nArthur Pym, meanwhile, was beginning to suffer from the hot and\r\nvitiated atmosphere of the hold. Terrible nightmares troubled his\r\nsleep. He was conscious of raving, and in vain sought some place\r\namid the mass of cargo where he might breathe a little more easily.\r\nIn one of these fits of delirium he imagined that he was gripped in\r\nthe claws of an African lion,(1) and in a paroxysm of terror he was\r\nabout to betray himself by screaming, when he lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that he was not dreaming at all. It was not a lion that\r\nArthur Pym felt crouching upon his chest, it was his own dog, Tiger,\r\na young Newfoundland. The animal had been smuggled on board by\r\nAugustus Barnard unperceived by anybody--(this, at least, is an\r\nunlikely occurrence). At the moment of Arthur\'s coming out of his\r\nswoon the faithful Tiger was licking his face and hands with lavish\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nNow the prisoner had a companion. Unfortunately, the said companion\r\nhad drunk the contents of the water jar while Arthur was\r\nunconscious, and when Arthur Pym felt thirsty, he discovered that\r\nthere was "not a drop to drink!" His lantern had gone out during\r\nhis prolonged faint; he could not find the candles and the\r\ntinder-box, and he then resolved to rejoin Augustus Barnard at all\r\nhazards. He came out of the chest, and although faint from inanition\r\nand trembling with weakness, he felt his way in the direction of the\r\ntrap-door by means of the rope. But, while he was approaching, one\r\nof the bales of cargo, shifted by the rolling of the ship, fell down\r\nand blocked up the passage. With immense but quite useless exertion\r\nhe contrived to get over this obstacle, but when he reached the\r\ntrap-door under Augustus Barnard\'s cabin he failed to raise it,\r\nand on slipping the blade of his knife through one of the joints he\r\nfound that a heavy mass of iron was placed upon the trap, as though\r\nit were intended to condemn him beyond hope. He had to renounce his\r\nattempt and drag himself back towards the chest, on which he fell,\r\nexhausted, while Tiger covered him with caresses.\r\n\r\nThe master and the dog were desperately thirsty, and when Arthur\r\nstretched out his hand, he found Tiger lying on his back, with his\r\npaws up and his hair on end. He then felt Tiger all over, and his\r\nhand encountered a string passed round the dog\'s body. A strip of\r\npaper was fastened to the string under his left shoulder.\r\n\r\nArthur Pym had reached the last stage of weakness. Intelligence was\r\nalmost extinct. However, after several fruitless attempts to procure\r\na light, he succeeded in rubbing the paper with a little\r\nphosphorus--(the details given in Edgar Poe\'s narrative are\r\ncuriously minute at this point)--and then by the glimmer that\r\nlasted less than a second he discerned just seven words at the end\r\nof a sentence. Terrifying words these were: _blood--remain\r\nhidden--life depends on it_.\r\n\r\nWhat did these words mean? Let us consider the situation of Arthur\r\nPym, at the bottom of the ship\'s hold, between the boards of a\r\nchest, without light, without water, with only ardent liquor to\r\nquench his thirst! And this warning to remain hidden, preceded by\r\nthe word "blood"--that supreme word, king of words, so full of\r\nmystery, of suffering, of terror! Had there been strife on board the\r\n_Grampus_? Had the brig been attacked by pirates? Had the crew\r\nmutinied? How long had this state of things lasted?\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that the marvellous poet had exhausted the\r\nresources of his imagination in the terror of such a situation; but\r\nit was not so. There is more to come!\r\n\r\nArthur Pym lay stretched upon his mattress, incapable of thought, in\r\na sort of lethargy; suddenly he became aware of a singular sound, a\r\nkind of continuous whistling breathing. It was Tiger, panting, Tiger\r\nwith eyes that glared in the midst of the darkness, Tiger with\r\ngnashing teeth--Tiger gone mad. Another moment and the dog had\r\nsprung upon Arthur Pym, who, wound up to the highest pitch of\r\nhorror, recovered sufficient strength to ward off his fangs, and\r\nwrapping around him a blanket which Tiger had torn with his white\r\nteeth, he slipped out of the chest, and shut the sliding side upon\r\nthe snapping and struggling brute.\r\n\r\nArthur Pym contrived to slip through the stowage of the hold, but\r\nhis head swam, and, falling against a bale, he let his knife drop\r\nfrom his hand.\r\n\r\nJust as he felt himself breathing his last sigh he heard his name\r\npronounced, and a bottle of water was held to his lips. He swallowed\r\nthe whole of its contents, and experienced the most exquisite of\r\npleasures.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, Augustus Barnard, seated with his comrade in a\r\ncorner of the hold, told him all that had occurred on board the brig.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, I repeat, the story is admissible, but we have not\r\nyet come to the events which "surpass all probability by their\r\nmarvellousness."\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Grampus_ numbered thirty-six men, including the\r\nBarnards, father and son. After the brig had put to sea on the 20th\r\nof June, Augustus Barnard had made several attempts to rejoin Arthur\r\nPym in his hiding-place, but in vain. On the third day a mutiny\r\nbroke out on board, headed by the ship\'s cook, a negro like our\r\nEndicott; but he, let me say at once, would never have thought of\r\nheading a mutiny.\r\n\r\nNumerous incidents are related in the romance--the massacre of most\r\nof the sailors who remained faithful to Captain Barnard, then the\r\nturning adrift of the captain and four of those men in a small\r\nwhaler\'s boat when the ship was abreast of the Bermudas. These\r\nunfortunate persons were never heard of again.\r\n\r\nAugustus Barnard would not have been spared, but for the\r\nintervention of the sailing-master of the _Grampus_. This\r\nsailing-master was a half-breed named Dirk Peters, and was the\r\nperson whom Captain Len Guy had gone to look for in Illinois!\r\n\r\nThe _Grampus_ then took a south-east course under the command of the\r\nmate, who intended to pursue the occupation of piracy in the\r\nsouthern seas.\r\n\r\nThese events having taken place, Augustus Barnard would again have\r\njoined Arthur Pym, but he had been shut up in the forecastle in\r\nirons, and told by the ship\'s cook that he would not be allowed to\r\ncome out until "the brig should be no longer a brig." Nevertheless,\r\na few days afterwards, Augustus contrived to get rid of his fetters,\r\nto cut through the thin partition between him and the hold, and,\r\nfollowed by Tiger, he tried to reach his friend\'s hiding-place. He\r\ncould not succeed, but the dog had scented Arthur Pym, and this\r\nsuggested to Augustus the idea of fastening a note to Tiger\'s neck\r\nbearing the words:\r\n\r\n"I scrawl this with blood--remain hidden--your life depends on\r\nit--"\r\n\r\nThis note, as we have already learned, Arthur Pym had received. Just\r\nas he had arrived at the last extremity of distress his friend\r\nreached him.\r\n\r\nAugustus added that discord reigned among the mutineers. Some wanted\r\nto take the _Grampus_ towards the Cape Verde Islands; others, and Dirk\r\nPeters was of this number, were bent on sailing to the Pacific Isles.\r\n\r\nTiger was not mad. He was only suffering from terrible thirst, and\r\nsoon recovered when it was relieved.\r\n\r\nThe cargo of the _Grampus_ was so badly stowed away that Arthur Pym\r\nwas in constant danger from the shifting of the bales, and Augustus,\r\nat all risks, helped him to remove to a corner of the \xe2\x80\x98tween decks.\r\n\r\nThe half-breed continued to be very friendly with the son of Captain\r\nBarnard, so that the latter began to consider whether the\r\nsailing-master might not be counted on in an attempt to regain\r\npossession of the ship.\r\n\r\nThey were just thirty days out from Nantucket when, on the 4th of\r\nJuly, an angry dispute arose among the mutineers about a little brig\r\nsignalled in the offing, which some of them wanted to take and\r\nothers would have allowed to escape. In this quarrel a sailor\r\nbelonging to the cook\'s party, to which Dirk Peters had attached\r\nhimself, was mortally injured. There were now only thirteen men on\r\nboard, counting Arthur Pym.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances a terrible storm arose, and the _Grampus_\r\nwas mercilessly knocked about. This storm raged until the 9th of\r\nJuly, and on that day, Dirk Peters having manifested an intention of\r\ngetting rid of the mate, Augustus Barnard readily assured him of his\r\nassistance, without, however, revealing the fact of Arthur Pym\'s\r\npresence on board. Next day, one of the cook\'s adherents, a man\r\nnamed Rogers, died in convulsions, and, beyond all doubt, of poison.\r\nOnly four of the cook\'s party then remained, of these Dirk Peters\r\nwas one. The mate had five, and would probably end by carrying the\r\nday over the cook\'s party.\r\n\r\nThere was not an hour to lose. The half-breed having informed\r\nAugustus Barnard that the moment for action had arrived, the latter\r\ntold him the truth about Arthur Pym.\r\n\r\nWhile the two were in consultation upon the means to be employed for\r\nregaining possession of the ship, a tempest was raging, and\r\npresently a gust of irresistible force struck the _Grampus_ and flung\r\nher upon her side, so that on righting herself she shipped a\r\ntremendous sea, and there was considerable confusion on board. This\r\noffered a favourable opportunity for beginning the struggle,\r\nalthough the mutineers had made peace among themselves. The latter\r\nnumbered nine men, while the half-breed\'s party consisted only of\r\nhimself, Augustus Barnard and Arthur Pym. The ship\'s master\r\npossessed only two pistols and a hanger. It was therefore necessary\r\nto act with prudence.\r\n\r\nThen did Arthur Pym (whose presence on board the mutineers could not\r\nsuspect) conceive the idea of a trick which had some chance of\r\nsucceeding. The body of the poisoned sailor was still lying on the\r\ndeck; he thought it likely, if he were to put on the dead man\'s\r\nclothes and appear suddenly in the midst of those superstitious\r\nsailors, that their terror would place them at the mercy of Dirk\r\nPeters. It was still dark when the half-breed went softly towards\r\nthe ship\'s stern, and, exerting his prodigious strength to the\r\nutmost, threw himself upon the man at the wheel and flung him over\r\nthe poop.\r\n\r\nAugustus Barnard and Arthur Pym joined him instantly, each armed\r\nwith a belaying-pin. Leaving Dirk Peters in the place of the\r\nsteersman, Arthur Pym, so disguised as to present the appearance of\r\nthe dead man, and his comrade, posted themselves close to the head\r\nof the forecastle gangway. The mate, the ship\'s cook, all the\r\nothers were there, some sleeping, the others drinking or talking;\r\nguns and pistols were within reach of their hands.\r\n\r\nThe tempest raged furiously; it was impossible to stand on the deck.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the mate gave the order for Augustus Barnard and Dirk\r\nPeters to be brought to the forecastle. This order was transmitted\r\nto the man at the helm, no other than Dirk Peters, who went down,\r\naccompanied by Augustus Barnard, and almost simultaneously Arthur\r\nPym made his appearance.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the apparition was prodigious. The mate, terrified on\r\nbeholding the resuscitated sailor, sprang up, beat the air with his\r\nhands, and fell down dead. Then Dirk Peters rushed upon the others,\r\nseconded by Augustus Barnard, Arthur Pym, and the dog Tiger. In a\r\nfew moments all were strangled or knocked on the head,--save Richard\r\nParker, the sailor, whose life was spared.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while the tempest was in full force, only four men were\r\nleft to work the brig, which was labouring terribly with seven feet\r\nof water in her hold. They had to cut down the mainmast, and, when\r\nmorning came, the mizen. That day was truly awful, the night was\r\nmore awful still! If Dirk Peters and his companions had not lashed\r\nthemselves securely to the remains of the rigging, they must have\r\nbeen carried away by a tremendous sea, which drove in the hatches of\r\nthe _Grampus_.\r\n\r\nThen follows in the romance a minute record of the series of\r\nincidents ensuing upon this situation, from the 14th of July to the\r\n7th of August; the fishing for victuals in the submerged hold, the\r\ncoming of a mysterious brig laden with corpses, which poisoned the\r\natmosphere and passed on like a huge coffin, the sport of a wind of\r\ndeath; the torments of hunger and thirst; the impossibility of\r\nreaching the provision store; the drawing of lots by straws--the\r\nshortest gave Richard Parker to be sacrificed for the life of the\r\nother three--the death of that unhappy man, who was killed by Dirk\r\nPeters and devoured; lastly, the finding in the hold of a jar of\r\nolives and a small turtle.\r\n\r\nOwing to the displacement of her cargo the _Grampus_ rolled and\r\npitched more and more. The frightful heat caused the torture of\r\nthirst to reach the extreme limit of human endurance, and on the 1st\r\nof August, Augustus Barnard died. On the 3rd, the brig foundered in\r\nthe night, and Arthur Pym and the half-breed, crouching upon the\r\nupturned keel, were reduced to feed upon the barnacles with which\r\nthe bottom was covered, in the midst of a crowd of waiting, watching\r\nsharks. Finally, after the shipwrecked mariners of the _Grampus_ had\r\ndrifted no less than twenty-five degrees towards the south, they\r\nwere picked up by the schooner _Jane_, of Liverpool, Captain William\r\nGuy.\r\n\r\nEvidently, reason is not outraged by an admission of the reality of\r\nthese facts, although the situations are strained to the utmost\r\nlimits of possibility; but that does not surprise us, for the writer\r\nis the American magician-poet, Edgar Poe. But from this moment\r\nonwards we shall see that no semblance of reality exists in the\r\nsuccession of incidents.\r\n\r\nArthur Pym and Dirk Peters were well treated on board the English\r\nschooner _Jane_. In a fortnight, having recovered from the effects of\r\ntheir sufferings, they remembered them no more. With alternations of\r\nfine and bad weather the _Jane_ sighted Prince Edward\'s Island on\r\nthe 13th of October, then the Crozet Islands, and afterwards the\r\nKerguelens, which I had left eleven days ago.\r\n\r\nThree weeks were employed in chasing sea-calves; these furnished the\r\n_Jane_ with a goodly cargo. It was during this time that the captain\r\nof the _Jane_ buried the bottle in which his namesake of the _Halbrane_\r\nclaimed to have found a letter containing William Guy\'s\r\nannouncement of his intention to visit the austral seas.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of November, the schooner left the Kerguelens, and after\r\na brief stay at Tristan d\'Acunha she sailed to reconnoitre the\r\nAuroras in 35\xc2\xb0 15\' of south latitude, and 37\xc2\xb0 38\' of west\r\nlongitude. But these islands were not to be found, and she did not\r\nfind them.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December the _Jane_ headed towards the Antarctic pole.\r\nOn the 26th, the first icebergs came in sight beyond the\r\nseventy-third degree.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1st to the 14th of January, 1828, the movements were\r\ndifficult, the polar circle was passed in the midst of ice-floes,\r\nthe icebergs\' point was doubled and the ship sailed on the surface\r\nof an open sea--the famous open sea where the temperature is 47\xc2\xb0\r\nFahrenheit, and the water is 34\xc2\xb0.\r\n\r\nEdgar Poe, every one will allow, gives free rein to his fancy at\r\nthis point. No navigator had ever reached latitudes so high--not\r\neven James Weddell of the British Navy, who did not get beyond the\r\nseventy-fourth parallel in 1822. But the achievement of the _Jane_,\r\nalthough difficult of belief, is trifling in comparison with the\r\nsucceeding incidents which Arthur Pym, or rather Edgar Poe, relates\r\nwith simple earnestness. In fact he entertained no doubt of reaching\r\nthe pole itself.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, not a single iceberg is to be seen on this\r\nfantastic sea. Innumerable flocks of birds skim its surface, among\r\nthem is a pelican which is shot. On a floating piece of ice is a\r\nbear of the Arctic species and of gigantic size. At last land is\r\nsignalled. It is an island of a league in circumference, to which\r\nthe name of Bennet Islet was given, in honour of the captain\'s\r\npartner in the ownership of the _Jane_.\r\n\r\nNaturally, in proportion as the schooner sailed southwards the\r\nvariation of the compass became less, while the temperature became\r\nmilder, with a sky always clear and a uniform northerly breeze.\r\nNeedless to add that in that latitude and in the month of January\r\nthere was no darkness.\r\n\r\nThe _Jane_ pursued her adventurous course, until, on the 18th of\r\nJanuary, land was sighted in latitude 83\xc2\xb0 20\' and longitude 43\xc2\xb0\r\n5\'.\r\n\r\nThis proved to be an island belonging to a numerous group scattered\r\nabout in a westerly direction.\r\n\r\nThe schooner approached and anchored off the shore. Arms were placed\r\nin the boats, and Arthur Pym got into one of the latter with Dirk\r\nPeters. The men rowed shorewards, but were stopped by four canoes\r\ncarrying armed men, "new men" the narrative calls them. These\r\nmen showed no hostile intentions, but cried out continuously\r\n"anamoo" and "lamalama." When the canoes were alongside the\r\nschooner, the chief, Too-Wit, was permitted to go on board with\r\ntwenty of his companions. There was profound astonishment on their\r\npart then, for they took the ship for a living creature, and lavished\r\ncaresses on the rigging, the masts, and the bulwarks. Steered\r\nbetween the reefs by these natives, she crossed a bay with a bottom\r\nof black sand, and cast anchor within a mile of the beach. Then\r\nWilliam Guy, leaving the hostages on board, stepped ashore amid the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nIf Arthur Pym is to be believed, this was Tsalal Island! Its trees\r\nresembled none of the species in any other zone of our planet. The\r\ncomposition of the rocks revealed a stratification unknown to modern\r\nmineralogists. Over the bed of the streams ran a liquid substance\r\nwithout any appearance of limpidity, streaked with distinct veins,\r\nwhich did not reunite by immediate cohesion when they were parted by\r\nthe blade of a knife!\r\n\r\nKlock-Klock, which we are obliged to describe as the chief\r\n"town" of the island, consisted of wretched huts entirely formed\r\nof black skins; it possessed domestic animals resembling the common\r\npig, a sort of sheep with a black fleece, twenty kinds of fowls,\r\ntame albatross, ducks, and large turtles in great numbers.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Klock-Klock, Captain William Guy and his companions\r\nfound a population--which Arthur Pym estimated at ten thousand\r\nsouls, men, women, and children--if not to be feared, at least to\r\nbe kept at a distance, so noisy and demonstrative were they.\r\nFinally, after a long halt at the hut of Too-Wit, the strangers\r\nreturned to the shore, where the "b\xc3\xaache-de-mer"--the favourite\r\nfood of the Chinese--would provide enormous cargoes; for the\r\nsucculent mollusk is more abundant there than in any other part of\r\nthe austral regions.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Guy immediately endeavoured to come to an\r\nunderstanding with Too-Wit on this matter, requesting him to\r\nauthorize the construction of sheds in which some of the men of the\r\n_Jane_ might prepare the b\xc3\xaache-de-mer, while the schooner should hold\r\non her course towards the Pole. Too-Wit accepted this proposal\r\nwillingly, and made a bargain by which the natives were to give\r\ntheir labour in the gathering-in of the precious mollusk.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a month, the sheds being finished, three men were told\r\noff to remain at Tsalal. The natives had not given the strangers\r\ncause to entertain the slightest suspicion of them. Before leaving\r\nthe place, Captain William Guy wished to return once more to the\r\nvillage of Klock-Klock, having, from prudent motives, left six men\r\non board, the guns charged, the bulwark nettings in their place, the\r\nanchor hanging at the forepeak--in a word, all in readiness to\r\noppose an approach of the natives. Too-Wit, escorted by a hundred\r\nwarriors, came out to meet the visitors. Captain William Guy and his\r\nmen, although the place was propitious to an ambuscade, walked in\r\nclose order, each pressing upon the other. On the right, a little in\r\nadvance, were Arthur Pym, Dirk Peters, and a sailor named Allen.\r\nHaving reached a spot where a fissure traversed the hillside, Arthur\r\nPym turned into it in order to gather some hazel nuts which hung in\r\nclusters upon stunted bushes. Having done this, he was returning to\r\nthe path, when he perceived that Allen and the half-breed had\r\naccompanied him. They were all three approaching the mouth of the\r\nfissure, when they were thrown down by a sudden and violent shock.\r\nAt the same moment the crumbling masses of the hill slid down upon\r\nthem, and they instantly concluded that they were doomed to be buried\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nAlive--all three? No! Allen had been so deeply covered by the\r\nsliding soil that he was already smothered, but Arthur Pym and Dirk\r\nPeters contrived to drag themselves on their knees, and opening a\r\nway with their bowie knives, to a projecting mass of harder clay,\r\nwhich had resisted the movement from above, and from thence they\r\nclimbed to a natural platform at the extremity of a wooded ravine.\r\nAbove them they could see the blue sky-roof, and from their position\r\nwere enabled to survey the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nAn artificial landslip, cunningly contrived by the natives, had\r\ntaken place. Captain William Guy and his twenty-eight companions had\r\ndisappeared; they were crushed beneath more than a million tons of\r\nearth and stones.\r\n\r\nThe plain was swarming with natives who had come, no doubt, from the\r\nneighbouring islets, attracted by the prospect of pillaging the\r\n_Jane_. Seventy boats were being paddled towards the ship. The six men\r\non board fired on them, but their aim was uncertain in the first\r\nvolley; a second, in which mitraille and grooved bullets were used,\r\nproduced terrible effect. Nevertheless, the _Jane_ being boarded by\r\nthe swarming islanders, her defenders were massacred, and she was\r\nset on fire.\r\n\r\nFinally a terrific explosion took place--the fire had reached the\r\npowder store--killing a thousand natives and mutilating as many\r\nmore, while the others fled, uttering the cry of _t\xc3\xa9k\xc3\xa9li-li!\r\nt\xc3\xa9k\xc3\xa9li-li!_\r\n\r\nDuring the following week, Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters, living on\r\nnuts and bitterns\' flesh, escaped discovery by the natives, who\r\ndid not suspect their presence. They found themselves at the bottom\r\nof a sort of dark abyss including several planes, but without issue,\r\nhollowed out from the hillside, and of great extent. The two men\r\ncould not live in the midst of these successive abysses, and after\r\nseveral attempts they let themselves slide on one of the slopes of\r\nthe hill. Instantly, six savages rushed upon them; but, thanks to\r\ntheir pistols, and the extraordinary strength of the half-breed,\r\nfour of the assailants were killed. The fifth was dragged away by\r\nthe fugitives, who reached a boat which had been pulled up on the\r\nbeach and was laden with three huge turtles. A score of natives\r\npursued and vainly tried to stop them; the former were driven off,\r\nand the boat was launched successfully and steered for the south.\r\n\r\nArthur Pym was then navigating beyond the eighty-fourth degree of\r\nsouth latitude. It was the beginning of March, that is to say, the\r\nantarctic winter was approaching. Five or six islands, which it was\r\nprudent to avoid, were visible towards the west. Arthur Pym\'s\r\nopinion was that the temperature would become more mild by degrees\r\nas they approached the pole. They tied together two white shirts\r\nwhich they had been wearing, and hoisted them to do duty as a sail.\r\nAt sight of these shirts the native, who answered to the name of\r\nNu-Nu, was terrified. For eight days this strange voyage continued,\r\nfavoured by a mild wind from the north, in permanent daylight, on a\r\nsea without a fragment of ice, indeed, owing to the high and even\r\ntemperature of the water, no ice had been seen since the parallel of\r\nBennet Island.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters entered upon a region of\r\nnovelty and wonder. Above the horizon line rose a broad bar of light\r\ngrey vapour, striped with long luminous rays, such as are projected\r\nby the polar aurora. A very strong current came to the aid of the\r\nbreeze. The boat sailed rapidly upon a liquid surface of milky\r\naspect, exceedingly hot, and apparently agitated from beneath. A\r\nfine white ash-dust began to fall, and this increased the terror of\r\nNu-Nu, whose lips trembled over his two rows of black ivory.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of March this rain of ashes fell in redoubled volume, and\r\nthe temperature of the water rose so high that the hand could no\r\nlonger bear it. The immense curtain of vapour, spread over the\r\ndistant perimeter of the southern horizon resembled a boundless\r\ncataract falling noiselessly from the height of some huge rampart\r\nlost in the height of the heavens.\r\n\r\nTwelve days later, it was darkness that hung over these waters,\r\ndarkness furrowed by luminous streaks darting from the milky depths\r\nof the Antarctic Ocean, while the incessant shower of ash-dust fell\r\nand melted in its waters.\r\n\r\nThe boat approached the cataract with an impetuous velocity whose\r\ncause is not explained in the narrative of Arthur Pym. In the midst\r\nof this frightful darkness a flock of gigantic birds, of livid white\r\nplumage, swept by, uttering their eternal _t\xc3\xa9k\xc3\xa9li-li_, and then the\r\nsavage, in the supreme throes of terror, gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in a mad whirl of speed, the boat rushed into the grasp of\r\nthe cataract, where a vast gulf seemed ready to swallow it up. But\r\nbefore the mouth of this gulf there stood a veiled human figure, of\r\ngreater size than any inhabitant of this earth, and the colour of\r\nthe man\'s skin was the perfect whiteness of snow.\r\n\r\nSuch is the strange romance conceived by the more than human genius\r\nof the greatest poet of the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) The American "lion" is only a small species of puma, and not\r\nformidable enough to terrify a Nantucket youth. J.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nAN OCEAN WAIF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe navigation of the _Halbrane_ went on prosperously with the help of\r\nthe sea and the wind. In fifteen days, if this state of things\r\nlasted, she might reach Tristan d\'Acunha. Captain Len Guy left the\r\nworking of the ship to James West, and well might he do so; there\r\nwas nothing to fear with such a seaman as he.\r\n\r\n"Our lieutenant has not his match afloat," said Hurliguerly to\r\nme one day. "He ought to be in command of a flag-ship."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," I replied, "he seems to be a true son of the sea."\r\n\r\n"And then, our _Halbrane_, what a craft! Congratulate yourself, Mr.\r\nJeorling, and congratulate yourself also that I succeeded in\r\nbringing the captain to change his mind about you."\r\n\r\n"If it was you who obtained that result, boatswain, I thank you\r\nheartily."\r\n\r\n"And so you ought, for he was plaguily against it, was our\r\ncaptain, in spite of all old man Atkins could say. But I managed to\r\nmake him hear reason."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t forget it, boatswain, I shan\'t forget it, since,\r\nthanks to your intervention, instead of moping at Kerguelen I hope\r\nshortly to get within sight of Tristan d\'Acunha."\r\n\r\n"In a few days, Mr. Jeorling. Only think, sir, according to what I\r\nhear tell, they are making ships in England and America with\r\nmachines in their insides, and wheels which they use as a duck uses\r\nits paddles. All right, we shall know what\'s the good of them when\r\nthey come into use. My notion is, however, that those ships will\r\nnever be able to fight with a fine frigate sailing with a fresh\r\nbreeze."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the 3rd of September. If nothing occurred to delay us, our\r\nschooner would be in sight of port in three days. The chief island\r\nof the group is visible on clear days at a great distance.\r\n\r\nThat day, between ten and eleven o\'clock in the morning, I was\r\nwalking backwards and forwards on the deck, on the windward side. We\r\nwere sliding smoothly over the surface of an undulating sea. The\r\n_Halbrane_ resembled an enormous bird, one of the gigantic albatross\r\nkind described by Arthur Pym--which had spread its sail-like wings,\r\nand was carrying a whole ship\'s crew towards space.\r\n\r\nJames West was looking out through his glasses to starboard at an\r\nobject floating two or three miles away, and several sailors,\r\nhanging over the side, were also curiously observing it.\r\n\r\nI went forward and looked attentively at the object. It was an\r\nirregularly formed mass about twelve yards in length, and in the\r\nmiddle of it there appeared a shining lump.\r\n\r\n"That is no whale," said Martin Holt, the sailing-master. "It\r\nwould have blown once or twice since we have been looking at it."\r\n\r\n"Certainly!" assented Hardy. "Perhaps it is the carcase of\r\nsome deserted ship."\r\n\r\n"May the devil send it to the bottom!" cried Roger. "It would\r\nbe a bad job to come up against it in the dark; it might send us\r\ndown before we could know what had happened."\r\n\r\n"I believe you," added Drap, "and these derelicts are more\r\ndangerous than a rock, for they are now here and again there, and\r\nthere\'s no avoiding them."\r\n\r\nHurliguerly came up at this moment and planted his elbows on the\r\nbulwark, alongside of mine.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of it, boatswain?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"It is my opinion, Mr. Jeorling," replied the boatswain, "that\r\nwhat we see there is neither a blower nor a wreck, but merely a lump\r\nof ice."\r\n\r\n"Hurliguerly is right," said James West; "it is a lump of ice,\r\na piece of an iceberg which the currents have carried hither."\r\n\r\n"What?" said I, "to the forty-fifth parallel?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," answered West, "that has occurred, and the ice\r\nsometimes gets up as high as the Cape, if we are to take the word of\r\na French navigator, Captain Blosseville, who met one at this height\r\nin 1828."\r\n\r\n"Then this mass will melt before long," I observed, feeling not\r\na little surprised that West had honoured me by so lengthy a reply.\r\n\r\n"It must indeed be dissolved in great part already," he\r\ncontinued, "and what we see is the remains of a mountain of ice\r\nwhich must have weighed millions of tons."\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy now appeared, and perceiving the group of sailors\r\naround West, he came forward. A few words were exchanged in a low\r\ntone between the captain and the lieutenant, and the latter passed\r\nhis glass to the former, who turned it upon the floating object, now\r\nat least a mile nearer to us.\r\n\r\n"It is ice," said he, "and it is lucky that it is dissolving!\r\nThe _Halbrane_ might have come to serious grief by collision with it\r\nin the night."\r\n\r\nI was struck by the fixity of his gaze upon the object, whose nature\r\nhe had so promptly declared: he continued to contemplate it for\r\nseveral minutes, and I guessed what was passing in the mind of the\r\nman under the obsession of a fixed idea. This fragment of ice, torn\r\nfrom the southern icebergs, came from those waters wherein his\r\nthoughts continually ranged. He wanted to see it more near, perhaps\r\nat close quarters, it might be to take away some bits of it. At an\r\norder from West the schooner was directed towards the floating mass;\r\npresently we were within two cables\'-length, and I could examine\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe mound in the center was melting rapidly; before the end of the\r\nday nothing would remain of the fragment of ice which had been\r\ncarried by the currents so high up as the forty-fifth parallel.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy gazed at it steadily, but he now needed no glass,\r\nand presently we all began to distinguish a second object which\r\nlittle by little detached itself from the mass, according as the\r\nmelting process went on--a black shape, stretched on the white ice.\r\n\r\nWhat was our surprise, mingled with horror, when we saw first an\r\narm, then a leg, then a trunk, then a head appear, forming a human\r\nbody, not in a state of nakedness, but clothed in dark garments.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I even thought that the limbs moved, that the hands\r\nwere stretched towards us.\r\n\r\nThe crew uttered a simultaneous cry. No! this body was not moving,\r\nbut it was slowly slipping off the icy surface.\r\n\r\nI looked at Captain Len Guy. His face was as livid as that of the\r\ncorpse that had drifted down from the far latitudes of the austral\r\nzone. What could be done was done to recover the body of the\r\nunfortunate man, and who can tell whether a faint breath of life did\r\nnot animate it even then? In any case his pockets might perhaps\r\ncontain some document that would enable his identity to be\r\nestablished. Then, accompanied by a last prayer, those human remains\r\nshould be committed to the depths of the ocean, the cemetery of\r\nsailors who die at sea.\r\n\r\nA boat was let down. I followed it with my eyes as it neared the\r\nside of the ice fragment eaten by the waves.\r\n\r\nHurliguerly set foot upon a spot which still offered some\r\nresistance. Gratian got out after him, while Francis kept the boat\r\nfast by the chain. The two crept along the ice until they reached\r\nthe corpse, then drew it to them by the arms and legs and so got it\r\ninto the boat. A few strokes of the oars and the boatswain had\r\nrejoined the schooner. The corpse, completely frozen, having been\r\nlaid at the foot of the mizen mast, Captain Len Guy approached and\r\nexamined it long and closely, as though he sought to recognize it.\r\n\r\nIt was the corpse of a sailor, dressed in coarse stuff, woollen\r\ntrousers and a patched jersey; a belt encircled his waist twice. His\r\ndeath had evidently occurred some months previously, probably very\r\nsoon after the unfortunate man had been carried away by the drift.\r\nHe was about forty, with slightly grizzled hair, a mere skeleton\r\ncovered with skin. He must have suffered agonies of hunger.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy lifted up the hair, which had been preserved by the\r\ncold, raised the head, gazed upon the scaled eyelids, and finally\r\nsaid with a sort of sob,--\r\n\r\n"Patterson! Patterson!"\r\n\r\n"Patterson?" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe name, common as it was, touched some chord in my memory. When\r\nhad I heard it uttered? Had I read it anywhere?\r\n\r\nAt this moment, James West, on a hint from the boatswain, searched\r\nthe pockets of the dead man, and took out of them a knife, some\r\nstring, an empty tobacco box, and lastly a leather pocket-book\r\nfurnished with a metallic pencil.\r\n\r\n"Give me that," said the captain. Some of the leaves were\r\ncovered with writing, almost entirely effaced by the damp. He found,\r\nhowever, some words on the last page which were still legible, and\r\nmy emotion may be imagined when I heard him read aloud in a\r\ntrembling voice: "The _Jane . . ._ Tsalal island . . . by\r\neighty-three . . . There . . . eleven years . . . Captain . . . five\r\nsailors surviving . . . Hasten to bring them aid."\r\n\r\nAnd under these lines was a name, a signature, the name of Patterson!\r\n\r\nThen I remembered! Patterson was the second officer of the _Jane_, the\r\nmate of that schooner which had picked up Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters\r\non the wreck of the _Grampus_, the _Jane_ having reached Tsalal Island;\r\nthe _Jane_ which was attacked by natives and blown up in the midst of\r\nthose waters.\r\n\r\nSo then it was all true? Edgar Poe\'s work was that of an\r\nhistorian, not a writer of romance? Arthur Gordon Pym\'s journal\r\nhad actually been confided to him! Direct relations had been\r\nestablished between them! Arthur Pym existed, or rather he had\r\nexisted, he was a real being! And he had died, by a sudden and\r\ndeplorable death under circumstances not revealed before he had\r\ncompleted the narrative of his extraordinary voyage. And what\r\nparallel had he reached on leaving Tsalal Island with his companion,\r\nDirk Peters, and how had both of them been restored to their native\r\nland, America?\r\n\r\nI thought my head was turning, that I was going mad--I who accused\r\nCaptain Guy of being insane! No! I had not heard aright! I had\r\nmisunderstood! This was a mere phantom of my fancy!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, how was I to reject the evidence found on the body of the\r\nmate of the _Jane_, that Patterson whose words were supported by\r\nascertained dates? And above all, how could I retain a doubt, after\r\nJames West, who was the most self-possessed among us, had succeeded\r\nin deciphering the following fragments of sentences:--\r\n\r\n"Drifting since the 3rd of June north of Tsalal Island. . . . Still\r\nthere . . . Captain William Guy and five of the men of the _Jane_--the\r\npiece of ice I am on is drifting across the iceberg . . . food will soon\r\nfail me. . . . Since the 13th of June . . . my last resources\r\nexhausted . . . to-day . . . 16th of June . . . I am going to die."\r\n\r\nSo then for nearly three months Patterson\'s body had lain on the\r\nsurface of this ice-waif which we had met on our way from the\r\nKerguelens to Tristan d\'Acunha! Ah! why had we not saved the mate\r\nof the _Jane_!\r\n\r\nI had to yield to evidence. Captain Len Guy, who knew Patterson, had\r\nrecognized him in this frozen corpse! It was indeed he who\r\naccompanied the captain of the _Jane_ when he had interred that\r\nbottle, containing the letter which I had refused to believe\r\nauthentic, at the Kerguelens. Yes! for eleven years, the survivors\r\nof the English schooner had been cast away there without any hope of\r\nsuccour.\r\n\r\nLen Guy turned to me and said,--\r\n\r\n"Do you believe--_now_?"\r\n\r\n"I believe," said I, falteringly; "but Captain William Guy of\r\nthe _Jane_, and Captain Len Guy of the _Halbrane_--"\r\n\r\n"Are brothers!" he cried in a loud voice, which was heard by all\r\nthe crew.\r\n\r\nThen we turned our eyes once more to the place where the lump of ice\r\nhad been floating; but the double influence of the solar rays and\r\nthe waters in this latitude had produced its effect, no trace of the\r\ndead man\'s last refuge remained on the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTRISTAN D\'ACUNHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour days later, the _Halbrane_ neared that curious island of Tristan\r\nd\'Acunha, which may be described as the big boiler of the African\r\nseas. By that time I had come to realize that the "hallucination" of\r\nCaptain Len Guy was a truth, and that he and the captain of the _Jane_\r\n(also a reality) were connected with each other by this ocean waif from\r\nthe authentic expedition of Arthur Pym. My last doubts were buried in\r\nthe depths of the ocean with the body of Patterson.\r\n\r\nAnd now, what was Captain Len Guy going to do? There was not a\r\nshadow of doubt on that point. He would take the _Halbrane_ to Tsalal\r\nIsland, as marked upon Patterson\'s note-book. His lieutenant,\r\nJames West, would go whithersoever he was ordered to go; his crew\r\nwould not hesitate to follow him, and would not be stopped by any\r\nfear of passing the limits assigned to human power, for the soul of\r\ntheir captain and the strength of their lieutenant would be in them.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the reason why Captain Len Guy refused to take\r\npassengers on board his ship, and why he had told me that his routes\r\nnever were certain; he was always hoping that an opportunity for\r\nventuring into the sea of ice might arise. Who could tell indeed,\r\nwhether he would not have sailed for the south at once without\r\nputting in at Tristan d\'Acunha, if he had not wanted water? After\r\nwhat I had said before I went on board the _Halbrane_, I should have\r\nhad no right to insist on his proceeding to the island for the sole\r\npurpose of putting me ashore. But a supply of water was\r\nindispensable, and besides, it might be possible there to put the\r\nschooner in a condition to contend with the icebergs and gain the\r\nopen sea--since open it was beyond the eighty-second parallel---in\r\nfact to attempt what Lieutenant Wilkes of the American Navy was then\r\nattempting.\r\n\r\nThe navigators knew at this period, that from the middle of November\r\nto the beginning of March was the limit during which some success\r\nmight be looked for. The temperature is more bearable then, storms\r\nare less frequent, the icebergs break loose from the mass, the ice\r\nwall has holes in it, and perpetual day reigns in that distant\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nTristan d\'Acunha lies to the south of the zone of the regular\r\nsouth-west winds. Its climate is mild and moist. The prevailing\r\nwinds are west and north-west, and, during the winter--August and\r\nSeptember--south. The island was inhabited, from 1811, by American\r\nwhale fishers. After them, English soldiers were installed there to\r\nwatch the St. Helena seas, and these remained until after the death\r\nof Napoleon, in 1821. Several years later the group of islands\r\npopulated by Americans and Dutchmen from the Cape acknowledged the\r\nsuzerainty of Great Britain, but this was not so in 1839. My\r\npersonal observation at that date convinced me that the possession\r\nof Tristan d\'Acunha was not worth disputing. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury the islands were called the Land of Life.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September, in the morning, the towering volcano of the\r\nchief island was signalled; a huge snow-covered mass, whose crater\r\nformed the basin of a small lake. Next day, on our approach, we\r\ncould distinguish a vast heaped-up lava field. At this distance the\r\nsurface of the water was striped with gigantic seaweeds, vegetable\r\nropes, varying in length from six hundred to twelve hundred feet,\r\nand as thick as a wine barrel.\r\n\r\nHere I should mention that for three days subsequent to the finding\r\nof the fragment of ice, Captain Len Guy came on deck for strictly\r\nnautical purposes only, and I had no opportunities of seeing him\r\nexcept at meals, when he maintained silence, that not even James\r\nWest could have enticed him to break. I made no attempt to do this,\r\nbeing convinced that the hour would come when Len Guy would again\r\nspeak to me of his brother, and of the efforts which he intended to\r\nmake to save him and his companions. Now, I repeat, the season being\r\nconsidered, that hour had not come, when the schooner cast anchor on\r\nthe 6th of September at Ansiedling, in Falmouth Bay, precisely in\r\nthe place indicated in Arthur Pym\'s narrative as the moorings of\r\nthe _Jane_.\r\n\r\nAt the period of the arrival of the _Jane_, an ex-corporal of the\r\nEnglish artillery, named Glass, reigned over a little colony of\r\ntwenty-six individuals, who traded with the Cape, and whose only\r\nvessel was a small schooner. At our arrival this Glass had more than\r\nfifty subjects, and was, as Arthur Pym remarked, quite independent\r\nof the British Government. Relations with the ex-corporal were\r\nestablished on the arrival of the _Halbrane_, and he proved very\r\nfriendly and obliging. West, to whom the captain left the business\r\nof refilling the water tanks and taking in supplies of fresh meat\r\nand vegetables, had every reason to be satisfied with Glass, who, no\r\ndoubt, expected to be paid, and was paid, handsomely.\r\n\r\nThe day after our arrival I met ex-corporal Glass, a vigorous,\r\nwell-preserved man, whose sixty years had not impaired his\r\nintelligent vivacity. Independently of his trade with the Cape and\r\nthe Falklands, he did an important business in seal-skins and the\r\noil of marine animals, and his affairs were prosperous. As he\r\nappeared very willing to talk, I entered briskly into conversation\r\nwith this self-appointed Governor of a contented little colony, by\r\nasking him,--\r\n\r\n"Do many ships put in to Tristan d\'Acunha?"\r\n\r\n"As many as we require," he replied, rubbing his hands together\r\nbehind his back, according to his invariable custom.\r\n\r\n"In the fine season?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in the fine season, if indeed we can be said to have any\r\nother in these latitudes."\r\n\r\n"I congratulate you, Mr. Glass. But it is to be regretted that\r\nTristan d\'Acunha has not a single port. If you possessed a\r\nlanding-stage, now?"\r\n\r\n"For what purpose, sir, when nature has provided us with such a\r\nbay as this, where there is shelter from gales, and it is easy to\r\nlie snug right up against the rocks? No, Tristan has no port, and\r\nTristan can do without one."\r\n\r\nWhy should I have contradicted this good man? He was proud of his\r\nisland, just as the Prince of Monaco is justly proud of his tiny\r\nprincipality.\r\n\r\nI did not persist, and we talked of various things. He offered to\r\narrange for me an excursion to the depths of the thick forests,\r\nwhich clothed the volcano up to the middle of the central cove.\r\n\r\nI thanked him, but declined his offer, preferring to employ my\r\nleisure on land in some mineralogical studies. Besides, the _Halbrane_\r\nwas to set sail so soon as she had taken in her provisions.\r\n\r\n"Your captain is in a remarkable hurry!" said Governor Glass.\r\n\r\n"You think so?"\r\n\r\n"He is in such haste that his lieutenant does not even talk of\r\nbuying skins or oil from me."\r\n\r\n"We require only fresh victuals and fresh water, Mr. Glass."\r\n\r\n"Very well," replied the Governor, who was rather annoyed,\r\n"what the _Halbrane_ will not take other vessels will."\r\n\r\nThen he resumed,--\r\n\r\n"And where is your schooner bound for on leaving us?"\r\n\r\n"For the Falklands, no doubt, where she can be repaired."\r\n\r\n"You, sir, are only a passenger, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"As you say, Mr. Glass, and I had even intended to remain at\r\nTristan d\'Acunha for some weeks. But I have had to relinquish that\r\nproject."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to hear it, sir. We should have been happy to offer\r\nyou hospitality while awaiting the arrival of another ship."\r\n\r\n"Such hospitality would have been most valuable to me," I\r\nreplied, "but unfortunately I cannot avail myself of it."\r\n\r\nIn fact, I had finally resolved not to quit the schooner, but to\r\nembark for America from the Falkland Isles without much delay. I\r\nfelt sure that Captain Len Guy would  not refuse to take me to the\r\nislands. I informed Mr. Glass of my intention, and he remarked,\r\nstill in a tone of annoyance,--\r\n\r\n"As for your captain, I have not even seen the colour of his\r\nhair."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he has any intention of coming ashore."\r\n\r\n"Is he ill?"\r\n\r\n"Not to my knowledge. But it does not concern you, since he has\r\nsent his lieutenant to represent him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, _he\'s_ a cheerful person! One may extract two words from him\r\noccasionally. Fortunately, it is easier to get coin out of his\r\npocket than speech out of his lips."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the important thing, Mr. Glass."\r\n\r\n"You are right, sir--Mr. Jeorling, of Connecticut, I believe?"\r\n\r\nI assented.\r\n\r\n"So! I know _your_ name, while I have yet to learn that of the\r\ncaptain of the _Halbrane_."\r\n\r\n"His name is Guy--Len Guy."\r\n\r\n"An Englishman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--an Englishman."\r\n\r\n"He might have taken the trouble to pay a visit to a countryman of\r\nhis, Mr. Jeorling! But stay! I had some dealings formerly with a\r\ncaptain of that name. Guy, Guy--"\r\n\r\n"William Guy?" I asked, quickly.\r\n\r\n"Precisely. William Guy."\r\n\r\n"Who commanded the _Jane_?"\r\n\r\n"The _Jane_? Yes. The same man."\r\n\r\n"An English schooner which put in at Tristan d\'Acunha eleven\r\nyears ago?"\r\n\r\n"Eleven years, Mr. Jeorling. I had been settled in the island\r\nwhere Captain Jeffrey, of the _Berwick_, of London, found me in the\r\nyear 1824, for full seven years. I perfectly recall this William\r\nGuy, as if he were before me. He was a fine, open-hearted fellow,\r\nand I sold him a cargo of seal-skins. He had the air of a gentleman,\r\nrather proud, but good-natured."\r\n\r\n"And the _Jane_?"\r\n\r\n"I can see her now at her moorings in the same place as the\r\n_Halbrane_. She was a handsome vessel of one hundred and eighty tons,\r\nvery slender for\'ards. She belonged to the port of Liverpool."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that is true, all that is true."\r\n\r\n"And is the _Jane_ still afloat, Mr. Jeorling?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Glass."\r\n\r\n"Was she lost?"\r\n\r\n"The fact is only too true, and the greater part of her crew with\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me how this happened?"\r\n\r\n"Willingly. On leaving Tristan d\'Acunha the _Jane_ headed for the\r\nbearings of the Aurora and other islands, which William Guy hoped to\r\nrecognize from information--"\r\n\r\n"That came from me," interrupted the ex-corporal. "And those\r\nother islands, may I learn whether the _Jane_ discovered them?"\r\n\r\n"No, nor the Auroras either, although William Guy remained several\r\nweeks in those waters, running from east to west, with a look-out\r\nalways at the masthead."\r\n\r\n"He must have lost his bearings, Mr. Jeorling, for, if several\r\nwhalers, who were well deserving of credit, are to be believed,\r\nthese islands do exist, and it was even proposed to give them my\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"That would have been but just," I replied politely.\r\n\r\n"It will be very vexatious if they are not discovered some day," added\r\nthe Governor, in a tone which indicated that he was not devoid of\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\n"It was then," I resumed, "that Captain Guy resolved to carry\r\nout a project he had long cherished, and in which he was encouraged\r\nby a certain passenger who was on board the _Jane_--"\r\n\r\n"Arthur Gordon Pym," exclaimed Glass, "and his companion, one\r\nDirk Peters; the two had been picked up at sea by the schooner."\r\n\r\n"You knew them, Mr. Glass?" I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Knew them, Mr. Jeorling? I should think I did, indeed! That\r\nArthur Pym was a strange person, always wanting to rush into\r\nadventures--a real rash American, quite capable of starting off to\r\nthe moon! Has he gone there at last?"\r\n\r\n"No, not quite, Mr. Glass, but, during her voyage, the schooner,\r\nit seems, did clear the polar circle, and pass the ice-wall. She got\r\nfarther than any ship had ever done before."\r\n\r\n"What a wonderful feat!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Unfortunately, the _Jane_ did not return. Arthur Pym and\r\nWilliam Guy escaped the doom of the _Jane_ and the most of her crew.\r\nThey even got back to America, how I do not know. Afterwards Arthur\r\nPym died, but under what circumstances I am ignorant. As for the\r\nhalf-breed, after having retired to Illinois, he went off one day\r\nwithout a word to anyone, and no trace of him has been found."\r\n\r\n"And William Guy?" asked Mr. Glass.\r\n\r\nI related the finding of the body of Patterson, the mate of the\r\n_Jane_, and I added that everything led to the belief that the captain\r\nof the _Jane_ and five of his companions were still living on an\r\nisland in the austral regions, at less than six degrees from the\r\nPole.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Mr. Jeorling," cried Glass, "if some day William Guy and\r\nhis sailors might be saved! They seemed to me to be such fine\r\nfellows."\r\n\r\n"That is just what the _Halbrane_ is certainly going to attempt, so\r\nsoon as she is ready, for her captain, Len Guy, is William Guy\'s\r\nown brother."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible? Well, although I do not know Captain Len Guy, I\r\nventure to assert that the brothers do not resemble each other--at\r\nleast in their behaviour to the Governor of Tristan d\'Acunha!"\r\n\r\nIt was plain that the Governor was profoundly mortified, but no\r\ndoubt he consoled himself by the prospect of selling his goods at\r\ntwenty-five per cent. above their value.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain: Captain Len Guy had no intention of coming\r\nashore. This was the more singular, inasmuch as he could not be\r\nunaware that the _Jane_ had put in at Tristan d\'Acunha before\r\nproceeding to the southern seas. Surely he might be expected to put\r\nhimself in communication with the last European who had shaken hands\r\nwith his brother!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Captain Len Guy remained persistently on board his\r\nship, without even going on deck; and, looking through the glass\r\nskylight of his cabin, I saw him perpetually stooping over the\r\ntable, which was covered with open books and out-spread charts. No\r\ndoubt the charts were those of the austral latitudes, and the books\r\nwere narratives of the precursors of the _Jane_ in those mysterious\r\nregions of the south.\r\n\r\nOn the table lay also a volume which had been read and re-read a\r\nhundred times. Most of its pages were dogs\'-eared and their\r\nmargins were filled with pencilled notes. And on the cover shone the\r\ntitle in brightly gilded letters:\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF ARTHUR GORDON PYM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nBOUND FOR THE FALKLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of September, in the evening, I had taken leave of His\r\nExcellency the Governor-General of the Archipelago of Tristan\r\nd\'Acunha--for such is the official title bestowed upon himself by\r\nthat excellent fellow, Glass, ex-corporal of artillery in the\r\nBritish Army. On the following day, before dawn, the _Halbrane_ sailed.\r\n\r\nAfter we had rounded Herald Point, the few houses of Ansiedlung\r\ndisappeared behind the extremity of Falmouth Bay. A fine breeze from\r\nthe east carried us along gaily.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning we left behind us in succession Elephant Bay,\r\nHardy Rock, West Point, Cotton Bay, and Daly\'s Promontory; but it\r\ntook the entire day to lose sight of the volcano of Tristan\r\nd\'Acunha, which is eight thousand feet high; its snow-clad bulk\r\nwas at last veiled by the shades of evening.\r\n\r\nDuring that week our voyage proceeded under the most favourable\r\nconditions; if these were maintained, the end of the month of\r\nSeptember ought to bring us within sight of the first peaks of the\r\nFalkland Group; and so, very sensibly towards the south; the\r\nschooner having descended from the thirty-eighth parallel to the\r\nfifty-fifth degree of latitude.\r\n\r\nThe most daring, or, perhaps I ought to say, the most lucky of those\r\ndiscoverers who had preceded the _Halbrane_, under the command of\r\nCaptain Len Guy, in the Antarctic seas, had not gone beyond--Kemp,\r\nthe sixty-sixth parallel; Ballerry, the sixty-seventh; Biscoe, the\r\nsixty-eighth; Bellinghausen and Morrell, the seventieth; Cook, the\r\nseventy-first; Weddell, the seventy-fourth. And it was beyond the\r\neighty-third, nearly five hundred and fifty miles farther, that we\r\nmust go to the succour of the survivors of the _Jane_!\r\n\r\nI confess that for a practical man of unimaginative temperament, I\r\nfelt strangely excited; a nervous restlessness had taken possession\r\nof me. I was haunted by the figures of Arthur Pym and his\r\ncompanions, lost in Antarctic ice-deserts. I began to feel a desire\r\nto take part in the proposed undertaking of Captain Len Guy. I\r\nthought about it incessantly. As a fact there was nothing to recall\r\nme to America. It is true that whether I should get the consent of\r\nthe commander of the _Halbrane_ remained to be seen; but, after all,\r\nwhy should he refuse to keep me as a passenger? Would it not be a\r\nvery "human" satisfaction to him to give me material proof that\r\nhe was in the right, by taking me to the very scene of a catastrophe\r\nthat I had regarded as fictitious, showing me the remains of the\r\n_Jane_ at Tsalal, and landing me on that selfsame island which I had\r\ndeclared to be a myth?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I resolved to wait, before I came to any definite\r\ndetermination, until an opportunity of speaking to the captain\r\nshould arise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cook\'s route was effectually barred by ice floes.]\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of unfavourable weather, during which the _Halbrane_\r\nmade but slow progress, on the 4th of October, in the morning, the\r\naspect of the sky and the sea underwent a marked change. The wind\r\nbecame calm, the waves abated, and the next day the breeze veered to\r\nthe north-west. This was very favourable to us, and in ten days,\r\nwith a continuance of such fortunate conditions, we might hope to\r\nreach the Falklands.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 11th that the opportunity of an explanation with\r\nCaptain Len Guy was presented to me, and by himself, for he came out\r\nof his cabin, advanced to the side of the ship where I was seated,\r\nand took his place at my side.\r\n\r\nEvidently he wished to talk to me, and of what, if not the subject\r\nwhich entirely absorbed him? He began by saying:\r\n\r\n"I have not yet had the pleasure of a chat with you, Mr. Jeorling,\r\nsince our departure from Tristan d\'Acunha!"\r\n\r\n"To my regret, captain," I replied, but with reserve, for I\r\nwanted him to make the running.\r\n\r\n"I beg you to excuse me," he resumed, "I have so many things\r\nto occupy me and make me anxious. A plan of campaign to organize, in\r\nwhich nothing must be unforeseen or unprovided for. I beg you not to\r\nbe displeased with me--"\r\n\r\n"I am not, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"That is all right, Mr. Jeorling; and now that I know you, that I\r\nam able to appreciate you, I congratulate myself upon having you for\r\na passenger until our arrival at the Falklands."\r\n\r\n"I am very grateful, captain, for what you have done for me, and I\r\nfeel encouraged to--"\r\n\r\nThe moment seemed propitious to my making my proposal, when Captain\r\nLen Guy interrupted me.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Jeorling," he asked, "are you now convinced of the\r\nreality of the voyage of the _Jane_, or do you still regard Edgar\r\nPoe\'s book as a work of pure imagination?"\r\n\r\n"I do not so regard it, captain."\r\n\r\n"You no longer doubt that Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters have really\r\nexisted, or that my brother William Guy and five of his companions\r\nare living?"\r\n\r\n"I should be the most incredulous of men, captain, to doubt either\r\nfact, and my earnest desire is that the favour of Heaven may attend\r\nyou and secure the safety of the shipwrecked mariners of the _Jane_."\r\n\r\n"I will do all in my power, Mr. Jeorling, and by the blessing of\r\nGod I shall succeed."\r\n\r\n"I hope so, captain. Indeed, I am certain it will be so, and if\r\nyou consent--"\r\n\r\n"Is it not the case that you talked of this matter with one Glass,\r\nan English ex-corporal, who sets up to be Governor of Tristan\r\nd\'Acunha?" inquired the captain, without allowing me to finish\r\nmy sentence.\r\n\r\n"That is so," I replied, "and what I learned from Glass has\r\ncontributed not a little to change my doubts into certainty."\r\n\r\n"Ah! he has satisfied you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He perfectly remembers to have seen the _Jane_, eleven years\r\nago, when she had put in at Tristan d\'Acunha."\r\n\r\n"The _Jane_--and my brother?"\r\n\r\n"He told me that he had personal dealings with Captain William\r\nGuy."\r\n\r\n"And he traded with the _Jane_?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, as he has just been trading with the _Halbrane_."\r\n\r\n"She was moored in this bay?"\r\n\r\n"In the same place as your schooner."\r\n\r\n"And--Arthur Pym--Dirk Peters?"\r\n\r\n"He was with them frequently."\r\n\r\n"Did he ask what had become of them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, and I informed him of the death of Arthur Pym, whom he\r\nregarded as a foolhardy adventurer, capable of any daring folly."\r\n\r\n"Say a madman, and a dangerous madman, Mr. Jeorling. Was it not he\r\nwho led my unfortunate brother into that fatal enterprise?"\r\n\r\n"There is, indeed, reason to believe so from his narrative."\r\n\r\n"And never to forget it!" added the captain in a tone of agitation.\r\n\r\n"This man, Glass," I resumed, "also knew Patterson, the mate\r\nof the _Jane_."\r\n\r\n"He was a fine, brave, faithful fellow, Mr. Jeorling, and devoted,\r\nbody and soul, to my brother."\r\n\r\n"As West is to you, captain."\r\n\r\n"Does Glass know where the shipwrecked men from the _Jane_ are\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"I told him, captain, and also all that you have resolved to do to\r\nsave them."\r\n\r\nI did not think proper to add that Glass had been much surprised at\r\nCaptain Guy\'s abstaining from visiting him, as, in his absurd\r\nvanity, he held the commander of the _Halbrane_ bound to do, nor that\r\nhe did not consider the Governor of Tristan d\'Acunha bound to take\r\nthe initiative.\r\n\r\n"I wish to ask you, Mr. Jeorling, whether you think everything in\r\nArthur Pym\'s journal, which has been published by Edgar Poe, is\r\nexactly true?"\r\n\r\n"I think there is some need for doubt," I answered "the\r\nsingular character of the hero of those adventures being taken into\r\nconsideration--at least concerning the phenomena of the island of\r\nTsalal. And we know that Arthur Pym was mistaken in asserting that\r\nCaptain William Guy and several of his companions perished in the\r\nlandslip of the hill at Klock-Klock."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but he does not assert this, Mr. Jeorling! He says only that,\r\nwhen he and Dirk Peters had reached the opening through which they\r\ncould discern the surrounding country, the seat of the artificial\r\nearthquake was revealed to them. Now, as the whole face of the hill\r\nwas rushing into the ravine, the fate of my brother and twenty-nine\r\nof his men could not be doubtful to his mind. He was, most\r\nnaturally, led to believe that Dirk Peters and himself were the only\r\nwhite men remaining alive on the island. He said nothing but\r\nthis--nothing more. These were only suppositions--very reasonable,\r\nare they not?"\r\n\r\n"I admit that, fully, captain."\r\n\r\n"But now, thanks to Patterson\'s note-book, we are certain that\r\nmy brother and five of his companions escaped from the landslip\r\ncontrived by the natives."\r\n\r\n"That is quite clear, captain. But, as to what became of the\r\nsurvivors of the _Jane_, whether they were taken by the natives of\r\nTsalal and kept in captivity, or remained free, Patterson\'s\r\nnote-book says nothing, nor does it relate under what circumstances\r\nhe himself was carried far away from them."\r\n\r\n"All that we shall learn, Mr. Jeorling. Yes, we shall know all.\r\nThe main point is that we are quite sure my brother and five of his\r\nsailors were living less than four months ago on some part of Tsalal\r\nIsland. There is now no question of a romance signed \xe2\x80\x98Edgar\r\nPoe,\' but of a veracious narrative signed \xe2\x80\x98Patterson.\'"\r\n\r\n"Captain," said I, "will you let me be one of your company\r\nuntil the end of the campaign of the _Halbrane_ in the Antarctic\r\nseas?"\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy looked at me with a glance as penetrating as a keen\r\nblade. Otherwise he did not appear surprised by the proposal I had\r\nmade; perhaps he had been expecting it--and he uttered only the\r\nsingle word:\r\n\r\n"Willingly."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nFITTING OUT THE _HALBRANE_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of October, our schooner cast anchor in Port Egmont, on\r\nthe north of West Falkland. The group is composed of two islands,\r\none the above-named, the other Soledad or East Falkland. Captain Len\r\nGuy gave twelve hours\' leave to the whole crew. The next day the\r\nproceedings were to begin by a careful and minute inspection of the\r\nvessel\'s hull and keel, in view of the contemplated prolonged\r\nnavigation of the Antarctic seas. That day Captain Len Guy went\r\nashore, to confer with the Governor of the group on the subject of\r\nthe immediate re-victualling of the schooner. He did not intend to\r\nmake expense a consideration, because the whole adventure might be\r\nwrecked by an unwise economy. Besides I was ready to aid with my\r\npurse, as I told him, and I intended that we should be partners in\r\ntile cost of this expedition.\r\n\r\nJames West remained on board all day, according to his custom in the\r\nabsence of the captain, and was engaged until evening in the\r\ninspection of the hold. I did not wish to go ashore until the next\r\nday. I should have ample time while we remained in port to explore\r\nPort Egmont and its surroundings, and to study the geology and\r\nmineralogy of the island. Hurliguerly regarded the opportunity as\r\nhighly favourable for the renewal of talk with me, and availed\r\nhimself of it accordingly. He accosted me as follows:\r\n\r\n"Accept my sincere compliments, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"And wherefore, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"On account of what I have just heard--that you are to come with\r\nus to the far end of the Antarctic seas."\r\n\r\n"Oh! not so far, I imagine, and if it is not a matter of going\r\nbeyond the eighty-fourth parallel--"\r\n\r\n"Who can tell," replied the boatswain, "at all events the\r\n_Halbrane_ will make more degrees of latitude than any other ship\r\nbefore her."\r\n\r\n"We shall see."\r\n\r\n"And does that not alarm you, Mr. Jeorling?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the very least."\r\n\r\n"Nor us, rest assured. No, no! You see, Mr. Jeorling, our captain\r\nis a good one, although he is no talker. You only need to take him\r\nthe right way! First he gives you the passage to Tristan d\'Acunha\r\nthat he refused you at first, and now he extends it to the pole."\r\n\r\n"The pole is not the question, boatswain."\r\n\r\n"Ah! it will be reached at last, some day."\r\n\r\n"The thing has not yet been done. And, besides, I don\'t take\r\nmuch interest in the pole, and have no ambition to conquer it. In\r\nany case it is only to Tsalal Island--"\r\n\r\n"Tsalal Island, of course. Nevertheless, you will acknowledge that\r\nour captain has been very accommodating to you, and--"\r\n\r\n"And therefore I am much obliged to him, boatswain, and," I\r\nhastened to add, "to you also; since it is to your influence I owe\r\nmy passage."\r\n\r\n"Very likely." Hurliguerly, a good fellow at bottom, as I\r\nafterwards learned, discerned a little touch of irony in my tone;\r\nbut he did not appear to do so; he was resolved to persevere in his\r\npatronage of me. And, indeed, his conversation could not be\r\notherwise than profitable to me, for he was thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the Falkland Islands. The result was that on the following day\r\nI went ashore adequately prepared to begin my perquisitions. At that\r\nperiod the Falklands were not utilized as they have been since.\r\n\r\nIt was at a later date that Port Stanley--described by Elis\xc3\xa9e\r\nR\xc3\xa9clus, the French geographer, as "ideal"--was discovered.\r\nPort Stanley is sheltered at every point of the compass, and could\r\ncontain all the fleets of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIf I had been sailing for the last two months with bandaged eyes,\r\nand without knowing whither the _Halbrane_ was bound, and had been\r\nasked during the first few hours at our moorings, "Are you in the\r\nFalkland Isles or in Norway?" I should have puzzled how to answer\r\nthe question. For here were coasts forming deep creeks, the steep\r\nhills with peaked sides, and the coast-ledges faced with grey rock.\r\nEven the seaside climate, exempt from great extremes of cold and\r\nheat, is common to the two countries. Besides, the frequent rains of\r\nScandinavia visit Magellan\'s region in like abundance. Both have\r\ndense fogs, and, in spring and autumn, winds so fierce that the very\r\nvegetables in the fields are frequently rooted up.\r\n\r\nA few walks inland would, however, have sufficed to make me\r\nrecognize that I was still separated by the equator from the waters\r\nof Northern Europe. What had I found to observe in the neighbourhood\r\nof Port Egmont  after my explorations of the first few days? Nothing\r\nbut the signs of a sickly vegetation, nowhere arborescent. Here and\r\nthere a few shrubs grew, in place of the flourishing firs of the\r\nNorwegian mountains, and the surface of a spongy soil which sinks\r\nand rises under the foot is carpeted with mosses, fungi, and\r\nlichens. No! this was not the enticing country where the echoes of\r\nthe sagas resound, this was not the poetic realm of Wodin and the\r\nValkyries.\r\n\r\nOn the deep waters of the Falkland Strait, which separates the two\r\nprincipal isles, great masses of extraordinary aquatic vegetation\r\nfloated, and the bays of the Archipelago, where whales were already\r\nbecoming scarce, were frequented by other marine mammals of enormous\r\nsize--seals, twenty-five feet long by twenty in circumference, and\r\ngreat numbers of sea elephants, wolves, and lions, of proportions no\r\nless gigantic. The uproar made by these animals, by the females and\r\ntheir young especially, surpasses description. One would think that\r\nherds of cattle were bellowing on the beach. Neither difficulty nor\r\ndanger attends the capture, or at least the slaughter of the marine\r\nbeasts. The sealers kill them with a blow of a club when they are\r\nlying in the sands on the strand. These are the special features\r\nthat differentiate Scandinavia from the Falklands, not to speak of\r\nthe infinite number of birds which rose on my approach, grebe,\r\ncormorants, black-headed swans, and above all, tribes of penguins,\r\nof which hundreds of thousands are massacred every year.\r\n\r\nOne day, when the air was filled with a sound of braying, sufficient\r\nto deafen one, I asked an old sailor belonging to Port Egmont,--\r\n\r\n"Are there asses about here?"\r\n\r\n"Sir," he replied, "those are not asses that you hear, but\r\npenguins."\r\n\r\nThe asses themselves, had any been there, would have been deceived\r\nby the braying of these stupid birds. I pursued my investigations\r\nsome way to the west of the bay. West Falkland is more extensive\r\nthan its neighbour, La Soledad, and possesses another fort at the\r\nsouthern point of Byron\'s Sound--too far off for me to go there.\r\n\r\nI could not estimate the population of the Archipelago even\r\napproximately. Probably, it did not then exceed from two to three\r\nhundred souls, mostly English, with some Indians, Portuguese,\r\nSpaniards, Gauchos from the Argentine Pampas, and natives from Tierra\r\nDel Fuego. On the other hand, the representatives of the ovine and\r\nbovine races were to be counted by tens of thousands. More than five\r\nhundred thousand sheep yield over four hundred thousand dollars\'\r\nworth of wool yearly. There are also horned cattle bred on the\r\nislands; these seem to have increased in size, while the other\r\nquadrupeds, for instance, horses, pigs, and rabbits, have decreased.\r\nAll these live in a wild state, and the only beast of prey is the\r\ndog-fox, a species peculiar to the fauna of the Falklands.\r\n\r\nNot without reason has this island been called "a cattle farm."\r\nWhat inexhaustible pastures, what an abundance of that savoury\r\ngrass, the tussock, does nature lavish on animals there! Australia,\r\nthough so rich in this respect, does not set a better spread table\r\nbefore her ovine and bovine pensioners.\r\n\r\nThe Falklands ought to be resorted to for the re-victualling of\r\nships. The groups are of real importance to navigators making for\r\nthe Strait of Magellan, as well as to those who come to fish in the\r\nvicinity of the polar regions.\r\n\r\nWhen the work on the hull was done, West occupied himself with the\r\nmasts and the rigging, with the assistance of Martin Holt, our\r\nsailing-master, who was very clever at this kind of industry.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of October, Captain Len Guy said to me:\r\n\r\n"You shall see, Mr. Jeorling, that nothing will be neglected to ensure\r\nthe success of our enterprise. Everything that can be foreseen has been\r\nforeseen, and if the _Halbrane_ is to perish in some catastrophe, it\r\nwill be because it is not permitted to human beings to go against\r\nthe designs of God."\r\n\r\n"I have good hopes, captain, as I have already said. Your vessel\r\nand her crew are worthy of confidence. But, supposing the expedition\r\nshould be much prolonged, perhaps the supply of provisions--"\r\n\r\n"We shall carry sufficient for two years, and those shall be of\r\ngood quality. Port Egmont has proved capable of supplying us with\r\neverything we require."\r\n\r\n"Another question, if you will allow me?"\r\n\r\n"Put it, Mr. Jeorling, put it."\r\n\r\n"Shall you not need a more numerous crew for the _Halbrane_?\r\nThough you have men enough for the working of the ship, suppose you\r\nfind you have to attack or to defend in the Antarctic waters? Let us\r\nnot forget that, according to Arthur Pym\'s narrative, there were\r\nthousands of natives on Tsalal Island, and if your brother--if his\r\ncompanions are prisoners--"\r\n\r\n"I hope, Mr. Jeorling, our artillery will protect the _Halbrane_\r\nbetter than the _Jane_ was protected by her guns. To tell the truth,\r\nthe crew we have would not be sufficient for an expedition of this\r\nkind. I have been arranging for recruiting our forces."\r\n\r\n"Will it be difficult?"\r\n\r\n"Yes and no; for the Governor has promised to help me."\r\n\r\n"I surmise, captain, that recruits will have to be attracted by\r\nlarger pay."\r\n\r\n"Double pay, Mr. Jeorling, and the whole crew must have the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\n"You know, captain, I am disposed, and, indeed, desirous to\r\ncontribute to the expenses of the expedition. Will you kindly\r\nconsider me as your partner?"\r\n\r\n"All that shall be arranged, Mr. Jeorling, and I am very grateful\r\nto you. The main point is to complete our armament with the least\r\npossible delay. We must be ready to clear out in a week."\r\n\r\nThe news that the schooner was bound for the Antarctic seas had\r\nproduced some sensation in the Falklands, at Port Egmont, and in the\r\nports of La Soledad. At that season a number of unoccupied sailors\r\nwere there, awaiting the passing of the whaling-ships to offer their\r\nservices, for which they were very well paid in general. If it had\r\nbeen only for a fishing campaign on the borders of the Polar\r\nCircle, between the Sandwich Islands and New Georgia, Captain Len\r\nGuy would have merely had to make a selection. But the projected\r\nvoyage was a very different thing; and only the old sailors of the\r\n_Halbrane_ were entirely indifferent to the dangers of such an\r\nenterprise, and ready to follow their chief whithersoever it might\r\nplease him to go.\r\n\r\nIn reality it was necessary to treble the crew of the schooner.\r\nCounting the captain, the mate, the boatswain, the cook and myself,\r\nwe were thirteen on board. Now, thirty-two or thirty-four men would\r\nnot be too many for us, and it must be remembered that there were\r\nthirty-eight on board the _Jane_.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the Governor exerted himself to the utmost, and\r\nthanks to the largely-extra pay that was offered, Captain Len Guy\r\nprocured his full tale of seamen. Nine recruits signed articles for\r\nthe duration of the campaign, which could not be fixed beforehand,\r\nbut was not to extend beyond Tsalal Island.\r\n\r\nThe crew, counting every man on board except myself, numbered\r\nthirty-one, and a thirty-second for whom I bespeak especial\r\nattention. On the eve of our departure, Captain Len Guy was accosted\r\nat the angle of the port by an individual whom he recognized as a\r\nsailor by his clothes, his walk, and his speech.\r\n\r\nThis individual said, in a rough and hardly intelligible voice,--\r\n\r\n"Captain, I have to make a proposal to you."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Have you still a place?"\r\n\r\n"For a sailor?"\r\n\r\n"For a sailor."\r\n\r\n"Yes and no."\r\n\r\n"Is it yes?"\r\n\r\n"It is yes, if the man suits me."\r\n\r\n"Will you take me?"\r\n\r\n"You are a seaman?"\r\n\r\n"I have served the sea for twenty-five years."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"In the Southern Seas."\r\n\r\n"Far?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, far, far."\r\n\r\n"Your age?"\r\n\r\n"Forty-four years."\r\n\r\n"And you are at Port Egmont?"\r\n\r\n"I shall have been there three years, come Christmas."\r\n\r\n"Did you expect to get on a passing whale-ship?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then what were you doing here?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, and I did not think of going to sea again."\r\n\r\n"Then why seek a berth?"\r\n\r\n"Just an idea. The news of the expedition your schooner is going\r\non was spread. I desire, yes, I desire to take part in it--with\r\nyour leave, of course."\r\n\r\n"You are known at Port Egmont?"\r\n\r\n"Well known, and I have incurred no reproach since I came here."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the captain. "I will make inquiry respecting\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Inquire, captain, and if you say yes, my bag shall be on board\r\nthis evening."\r\n\r\n"What is your name?"\r\n\r\n"Hunt."\r\n\r\n"And you are--?"\r\n\r\n"An American."\r\n\r\nThis Hunt was a man of short stature, his weather beaten face was\r\nbrick red, his skin of a yellowish-brown like an Indian\'s, his\r\nbody clumsy, his head very large, his legs were bowed, his whole\r\nframe denoted exceptional strength, especially the arms, which\r\nterminated in huge hands. His grizzled hair resembled a kind of fur.\r\n\r\nA particular and anything but prepossessing character was imparted\r\nto the physiognomy of this individual by the extraordinary keenness\r\nof his small eyes, his almost lipless mouth, which stretched from\r\near to ear, and his long teeth, which were dazzlingly white; their\r\nenamel being intact, for he had never been attacked by scurvy, the\r\ncommon scourge of seamen in high latitudes.\r\n\r\nHunt had been living in the Falklands for three years; he lived\r\nalone on a pension, no one knew from whence this was derived. He was\r\nsingularly uncommunicative, and passed his time in fishing, by which\r\nhe might have lived, not only as a matter of sustenance, but as an\r\narticle of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe information gained by Captain Len Guy was necessarily\r\nincomplete, as it was confined to Hunt\'s conduct during his\r\nresidence at Port Egmont. The man did not fight, he did not drink,\r\nand he had given many proofs of his Herculean strength. Concerning\r\nhis past nothing was known, but undoubtedly he had been a sailor. He\r\nhad said more to Len Guy than he had ever said to anybody; but he\r\nkept silence respecting the family to which he belonged, and the\r\nplace of his birth. This was of no importance; that he should prove\r\nto be a good sailor was all we had to think about. Hunt obtained a\r\nfavourable reply, and came on board that same evening.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, in the morning, in the presence of the authorities of\r\nthe Archipelago, the _Halbrane\'s_ anchor was lifted, the last good\r\nwishes and the final adieus were exchanged, and the schooner took\r\nthe sea. The same evening Capes Dolphin and Pembroke disappeared in\r\nthe mists of the horizon.\r\n\r\nThus began the astonishing adventure undertaken by these brave men,\r\nwho were driven by a sentiment of humanity towards the most terrible\r\nregions of the Antarctic realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE OUTSET OF THE ENTERPRISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere was I, then, launched into an adventure which seemed likely to\r\nsurpass all my former experiences. Who would have believed such a\r\nthing of me. But I was under a spell which drew me towards the\r\nunknown, that unknown of the polar world whose secrets so many\r\ndaring pioneers had in vain essayed to penetrate. And this time, who\r\ncould tell but that the sphinx of the Antarctic regions would speak\r\nfor the first time to human ears!\r\n\r\nThe new crew had firstly to apply themselves to learning their\r\nseveral duties, and the old--all fine fellows--aided them in the\r\ntask. Although Captain Len Guy had not had much choice, he seemed to\r\nhave been in luck. These sailors, of various nationalities,\r\ndisplayed zeal and good will. They were aware, also, that the mate\r\nwas a man whom it would not do to vex, for Hurliguerly had given\r\nthem to understand that West would break any man\'s head who did\r\nnot go straight. His chief allowed him full latitude in this respect.\r\n\r\n"A latitude," he added, "which is obtained by taking the\r\naltitude of the eye with a shut fist."\r\n\r\nI recognized my friend the boatswain in the manner of this warning\r\nto all whom it might concern.\r\n\r\nThe new hands took the admonition seriously, and there was no\r\noccasion to punish any of them. As for Hunt, while he observed the\r\ndocility of a true sailor in all his duties, he always kept himself\r\napart, speaking to none, and even slept on the deck, in a corner,\r\nrather than occupy a bunk in the forecastle with the others.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy\'s intention was to take the Sandwich Isles for his\r\npoint of departure towards the south, after having made acquaintance\r\nwith New Georgia, distant eight hundred miles from the Falklands.\r\nThus the schooner would be in longitude on the route of the _Jane_.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of November this course brought us to the bearings which\r\ncertain navigators have assigned to the Aurora Islands, 30\xc2\xb0 15\'\r\nof latitude and 47\xc2\xb0 33\' of east longitude.\r\n\r\nWell, then, notwithstanding the affirmations--which I regarded with\r\nsuspicion--of the captains of the _Aurora_ in 1762, of the _Saint\r\nMiguel_, in 1769, of the _Pearl_, in 1779, of the _Prinicus_ and the\r\n_Dolores_, in 1790, of the _Atrevida_, in 1794, which gave the bearings\r\nof the three islands of the group, we did not perceive a single\r\nindication of land in the whole of the space traversed by us. It was\r\nthe same with regard to the alleged islands of the conceited Glass.\r\nNot a single little islet was to be seen in the position he had\r\nindicated, although the look-out was most carefully kept. It is to\r\nbe feared that his Excellency the Governor of Tristan d\'Acunha\r\nwill never see his name figuring in geographical nomenclature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Taking in sail under difficulties.]\r\n\r\nIt was now the 6th of November. Our passage promised to be shorter\r\nthan that of the _Jane_. We had no need to hurry, however. Our\r\nschooner would arrive before the gates of the iceberg wall would\r\nbe open. For three days the weather caused the working of the ship\r\nto be unusually laborious, and the new crew behaved very well;\r\nthereupon the boatswain congratulated them. Hurliguerly bore witness\r\nthat Hunt, for all his awkward and clumsy build, was in himself worth\r\nthree men.\r\n\r\n"A famous recruit," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," I replied, "and gained just at the last\r\nmoment."\r\n\r\n"Very true, Mr. Jeorling! But what a face and head he has, that\r\nHunt!"\r\n\r\n"I have often met Americans like him in the regions of the Far\r\nWest," I answered, "and I should not be surprised if this man\r\nhad Indian blood in his veins. Do you ever talk with Hunt?"\r\n\r\n"Very seldom, Mr. Jeorling. He keeps himself to himself, and away\r\nfrom everybody. And yet, it is not for want of mouth. I never saw\r\nanything like his! And his hands! Have you seen his hands? Be on\r\nyour guard, Mr. Jeorling, if ever he wants to shake hands with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Fortunately, boatswain, Hunt does not seem to be quarrelsome. He\r\nappears to be a quiet man who does not abuse his strength."\r\n\r\n"No--except when he is setting a halyard. Then I am always afraid\r\nthe pulley will come down and the yard with it."\r\n\r\nHunt certainly was a strange being, and I could not resist observing\r\nhim with curiosity, especially as it struck me that he regarded me\r\nat times with a curious intentness.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, at about two in the afternoon, the look-out\r\nshouted,--\r\n\r\n"Land ahead, starboard!"\r\n\r\nAn observation had just given 55\xc2\xb0 7\' latitude and 41\xc2\xb0 13\'\r\nlongitude. This land could only be the Isle de Saint Pierre--its\r\nBritish names are South Georgia, New Georgia, and King George\'s\r\nIsland--and it belongs to the circumpolar regions.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered by the Frenchman, Barbe, in 1675, before Cook;\r\nbut, although he came in second, the celebrated navigator gave it\r\nthe series of names which it still bears.\r\n\r\nThe schooner took the direction of this island, whose snow-clad\r\nheights--formidable masses of ancient rock--rise to an immense\r\naltitude through the yellow fogs of the surrounding space.\r\n\r\nNew Georgia, situated within five hundred leagues of Magellan\r\nStraits, belongs to the administrative domain of the Falklands. The\r\nBritish administration is not represented there by anyone, the\r\nisland is not inhabited, although it is habitable, at least in the\r\nsummer season.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, while the men were gone in search of water, I\r\nwalked about in the vicinity of the bay. The place was an utter\r\ndesert, for the period at which sealing is pursued there had not\r\narrived. New Georgia, being exposed to the direct action of the\r\nAntarctic polar current, is freely frequented by marine mammals. I\r\nsaw several droves of these creatures on the rocks, the strand, and\r\nwithin the rock grottoes of the coast. Whole "smalas" of\r\npenguins, standing motionless in interminable rows, brayed their\r\nprotest against the invasion of an intruder--I allude to myself.\r\n\r\nInnumerable larks flew over the surface of the waters and the sands;\r\ntheir song awoke my memory of lands more favoured by nature. It is\r\nfortunate that these birds do not want branches to perch on; for\r\nthere does not exist a tree in New Georgia. Here and there I found a\r\nfew phanerogams, some pale-coloured mosses, and especially tussock\r\ngrass in such abundance that numerous herds of cattle might be fed\r\nupon the island.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th November the _Halbrane_ sailed once more, and having\r\ndoubled Charlotte Point at the extremity of Royal Bay, she headed in\r\nthe direction of the Sandwich Islands, four hundred miles from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\nSo far we had not encountered floating ice. The reason was that the\r\nsummer sun had not detached any, either from the icebergs or the\r\nsouthern lands. Later on, the current would draw them to the height\r\nof the fiftieth parallel, which, in the southern hemisphere, is that\r\nof Paris or Quebec. But we were much impeded by huge banks of fog\r\nwhich frequently shut out the horizon. Nevertheless, as these waters\r\npresented no danger, and there was nothing to fear from ice packs or\r\ndrifting icebergs, the _Halbrane_ was able to pursue her route towards\r\nthe Sandwich Islands comfortably enough. Great flocks of clangorous\r\nbirds, breasting the wind and hardly moving their wings, passed us\r\nin the midst of the fogs, petrels, divers, halcyons, and albatross,\r\nbound landwards, as though to show us the way.\r\n\r\nOwing, no doubt, to these mists, we were unable to discern Traversey\r\nIsland. Captain Len Guy, however, thought some vague streaks of\r\nintermittent light which were perceived in the night, between the\r\n14th and 15th, probably proceeded from a volcano which might be that\r\nof Traversey, as the crater frequently emits flames.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th November the schooner reached the Archipelago to which\r\nCook gave the name of Southern Thule in the first instance, as it\r\nwas the most southern land that had been discovered at that period.\r\nHe afterwards baptized it Sandwich Isles.\r\n\r\nJames West repaired to Thule in the large boat, in order to explore\r\nthe approachable points, while Captain Len Guy and I descended on\r\nthe Bristol strand.\r\n\r\nWe found absolutely desolate country; the only inhabitants were\r\nmelancholy birds of Antarctic species. Mosses and lichens cover the\r\nnakedness of an unproductive soil. Behind the beach a few firs rise\r\nto a considerable height on the bare hill-sides, from whence great\r\nmasses occasionally come crashing down with a thundering sound.\r\nAwful solitude reigns everywhere. There was nothing to attest the\r\npassage of any human being, or the presence of any shipwrecked\r\npersons on Bristol Island.\r\n\r\nWest\'s exploration at Thule produced a precisely similar result. A\r\nfew shots fired from our schooner had no effect but to drive away\r\nthe crowd of petrels and divers, and to startle the rows of stupid\r\npenguins on the beach.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Len Guy and I were walking, I said to him,--\r\n\r\n"You know, of course, what Cook\'s opinion on the subject of the\r\nSandwich group was when he discovered it. At first he believed he\r\nhad set foot upon a continent. According to him, the mountains of\r\nice carried out of the Antarctic Sea by the drift were detached from\r\nthat continent. He recognized afterwards that the Sandwiches only\r\nformed an Archipelago, but, nevertheless, his belief that a polar\r\ncontinent farther south exists, remained firm and unchanged."\r\n\r\n"I know that is so, Mr. Jeorling," replied the captain, "but\r\nif such a continent exists, we must conclude that there is a great\r\ngap in its coast, and that Weddell and my brother each got in by\r\nthat gap at six years\' interval. That our great navigator had not\r\nthe luck to discover this passage is easy to explain; he stopped at\r\nthe seventy-first parallel! But others found it after Captain Cook,\r\nand others will find it again."\r\n\r\n"And we shall be of the number, captain."\r\n\r\n"Yes--with the help of God! Cook did not hesitate to assert that\r\nno one would ever venture farther than he had gone, and that the\r\nAntarctic lands, if any such existed, would never be seen, but the\r\nfuture will prove that he was mistaken. They have been seen so far\r\nas the eighty-fourth degree of latitude--"\r\n\r\n"And who knows," said I, "perhaps beyond that, by Arthur\r\nPym."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, Mr. Jeorling. It is true that we have not to trouble\r\nourselves about Arthur Pym, since he, at least, and Dirk Peters\r\nalso, returned to America."\r\n\r\n"But--supposing he did not return?"\r\n\r\n"I consider that we have not to face that eventuality," replied\r\nCaptain Len Guy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nFROM THE SANDWICH ISLANDS TO THE POLAR CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Halbrane_, singularly favoured by the weather, sighted the New\r\nSouth Orkneys group in six days after she had sailed from the\r\nSandwich Islands. This archipelago was discovered by Palmer, an\r\nAmerican, and Bothwell, an Englishman, jointly, in 1821-22. Crossed\r\nby the sixty-first parallel, it is comprehended between the\r\nforty-fourth and the forty-seventh meridian.\r\n\r\nOn approaching, we were enabled to observe contorted masses and\r\nsteep cliffs on the north side, which became less rugged as they\r\nneared the coast, at whose edge lay enormous ice-floes, heaped\r\ntogether in formidable confusion; these, before two months should\r\nhave expired, would be drifted towards the temperate waters. At that\r\nseason the whaling ships would appear to carry on the taking of the\r\ngreat blowing creatures, while some of their crews would remain on\r\nthe islands to capture seals and sea-elephants.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the strait, which was encumbered with islets and\r\nice-floes, Captain Len Guy first cast anchor at the south-eastern\r\nextremity of Laurie Island, where he passed the day on the 24th;\r\nthen, having rounded Cape Dundas, he sailed along the southern coast\r\nof Coronation Island, where the schooner anchored on the 25th. Our\r\nclose and careful researches produced no result as regarded the\r\nsailors of the _Jane_.\r\n\r\nThe islands and islets were peopled by multitudes of birds. Without\r\ntaking the penguins into account, those guano-covered rocks were\r\ncrowded with white pigeons, a species of which I had already seen\r\nsome specimens. These birds have rather short, conical beaks, and\r\nred-rimmed eyelids; they can be knocked over with little difficulty.\r\nAs for the vegetable kingdom in the New South Orkneys, it is\r\nrepresented only by grey lichen and some scanty seaweeds. Mussels\r\nare found in great abundance all along the rocks; of these we\r\nprocured an ample supply.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain and his men did not lose the opportunity of killing\r\nseveral dozens of penguins with their sticks, not from a ruthless\r\ninstinct of destruction, but from the legitimate desire to procure\r\nfresh food.\r\n\r\n"Their flesh is just as good as chicken, Mr. Jeorling," said\r\nHurliguerly. "Did you not eat penguin at the Kerguelens?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, boatswain, but it was cooked by Atkins."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then; it will be cooked by Endicott here, and you will\r\nnot know the difference."\r\n\r\nAnd in fact we in the saloon, like the men in the forecastle, were\r\nregaled with penguin, and acknowledged the merits of our excellent\r\nsea-cook.\r\n\r\nThe _Halbrane_ sailed on the 26th of November, at six o\'clock in the\r\nmorning, heading south. She reascended the forty-third meridian;\r\nthis we were able to ascertain very exactly by a good observation.\r\nThis route it was that Weddell and then William Guy had followed,\r\nand, provided the schooner did not deflect either to the east or the\r\nwest, she must inevitably come to Tsalal Island. The difficulties of\r\nnavigation had to be taken into account, of course.\r\n\r\nThe wind, continuing to blow steadily from the west, was in our\r\nfavour, and if the present speed of the _Halbrane_ could be\r\nmaintained, as I ventured to suggest to Captain Len Guy, the voyage\r\nfrom the South Orkneys to the Polar Circle would be a short one.\r\nBeyond, as I knew, we should have to force the gate of the thick\r\nbarrier of icebergs, or to discover a breach in that ice-fortress.\r\n\r\n"So that, in less than a month, captain--" I suggested,\r\ntentatively.\r\n\r\n"In less than a month I hope to have found the iceless sea which\r\nWeddell and Arthur Pym describe so fully, beyond the ice-wall, and\r\nthenceforth we need only sail on under ordinary conditions to Bennet\r\nIsland in the first place, and afterwards to Tsalal Island. Once on\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98wide open sea,\' what obstacle could arrest or even retard\r\nour progress?"\r\n\r\n"I can foresee none, captain, so soon as we shall get to the back\r\nof the ice-wall. The passage through is the difficult point; it must\r\nbe our chief source of anxiety, and if only the wind holds--"\r\n\r\n"It will hold, Mr. Jeorling. All the navigators of the austral\r\nseas have been able to ascertain, as I myself have done, the\r\npermanence of this wind."\r\n\r\n"That is true, and I rejoice in the assurance, captain. Besides, I\r\nacknowledge, without shrinking from the admission, that I am\r\nbeginning to be superstitious."\r\n\r\n"And why not, Mr. Jeorling? What is there unreasonable in\r\nadmitting the intervention of a supernatural power in the most\r\nordinary circumstances of life? And we, who sail the _Halbrane_,\r\nshould we venture to doubt it? Recall to your mind our meeting with\r\nthe unfortunate Patterson on our ship\'s course, the fragment of\r\nice carried into the waters where we were, and dissolved immediately\r\nafterwards. Were not these facts providential? Nay, I go farther\r\nstill, and am sure that, after having done so much to guide us\r\ntowards our compatriots, God will not abandon us--"\r\n\r\n"I think as you think, captain. No, His intervention is not to be\r\ndenied, and I do not believe that chance plays the part assigned to\r\nit by superficial minds upon the stage of human life. All the facts\r\nare united by a mysterious chain."\r\n\r\n"A chain, Mr. Jeorling, whose first link, so far as we are\r\nconcerned, is Patterson\'s ice-block, and whose last will be Tsalal\r\nIsland. Ah! My brother! my poor brother! Left there for eleven\r\nyears, with his companions in misery, without being able to\r\nentertain the hope that succour ever could reach them! And Patterson\r\ncarried far away from them, under we know not what conditions, they\r\nnot knowing what had become of him! If my heart is sick when I think\r\nof these catastrophes, Mr. Jeorling, at least it will not fail me\r\nunless it be at the moment when my brother throws himself into my\r\narms."\r\n\r\nSo then we two were agreed in our trust in Providence. It had been\r\nmade plain to us in a manifest fashion that God had entrusted us\r\nwith a mission, and we would do all that might be humanly possible\r\nto accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThe schooner\'s crew, I ought to mention, were animated by the like\r\nsentiments, and shared the same hopes. I allude to the original\r\nseamen who were so devoted to their captain. As for the new ones,\r\nthey were probably indifferent to the result of the enterprise,\r\nprovided it should secure the profits promised to them by their\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nAt least, I was assured by the boatswain that such was the case, but\r\nwith the exception of Hunt. This man had apparently not been induced\r\nto take service by the bribe of high wages or prize money. He was\r\nabsolutely silent on that and every other subject.\r\n\r\n"If he does not speak to you, boatswain," I said, "neither\r\ndoes he speak to me."\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Mr. Jeorling, what it is my notion that man has\r\nalready done?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Hurliguerly."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I believe he has gone far, far into the southern\r\nseas, let him be as dumb as a fish about it. Why he _is_ dumb is his\r\nown affair. But if that sea-hog of a man has not been inside the\r\nAntarctic Circle and even the ice wall by a good dozen degrees, may\r\nthe first sea we ship carry me overboard."\r\n\r\n"From what do you judge, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"From his eyes, Mr. Jeorling, from his eyes. No matter at what\r\nmoment, let the ship\'s head be as it may, those eyes of his are\r\nalways on the south, open, unwinking, fixed like guns in position."\r\n\r\nHurliguerly did not exaggerate, and I had already remarked this. To\r\nemploy an expression of Edgar Poe\'s, Hunt had eyes like a\r\nfalcon\'s.\r\n\r\n"When he is not on the watch," resumed the boatswain, "that\r\nsavage leans all the time with his elbows on the side, as motionless\r\nas he is mute. His right place would be at the end of our bow, where\r\nhe would do for a figurehead to the _Halbrane_, and a very ugly one at\r\nthat! And then, when he is at the helm, Mr. Jeorling, just observe\r\nhim! His enormous hands clutch the handles as though they were\r\nfastened to the wheel; he gazes at the binnacle as though the magnet\r\nof the compass were drawing his eyes. I pride myself on being a good\r\nsteersman, but as for being the equal of Hunt, I\'m not! With him,\r\nnot for an instant does the needle vary from the sailing-line,\r\nhowever rough a lurch she may give. I am sure that if the binnacle\r\nlamp were to go out in the night Hunt would not require to relight\r\nit. The fire in his eyes would light up the dial and keep him\r\nright."\r\n\r\nFor several days our navigation went on in unbroken monotony,\r\nwithout a single incident, and under favourable conditions. The\r\nspring season was advancing, and whales began to make their\r\nappearance in large numbers.\r\n\r\nIn these waters a week would suffice for ships of heavy tonnage to\r\nfill their casks with the precious oil. Thus the new men of the\r\ncrew, and especially the Americans, did not conceal their regret for\r\nthe captain\'s indifference in the presence of so many animals\r\nworth their weight in gold, and more abundant than they had ever\r\nseen whales at that period of the year. The leading malcontent was\r\nHearne, a sealing-master, to whom his companions were ready to\r\nlisten. He had found it easy to get the upper hand of the other\r\nsailors by his rough manner and the surly audacity that was\r\nexpressed by his whole personality. Hearne was an American, and\r\nforty-five years of age. He was an active, vigorous man, and I could\r\nsee him in my mind\'s eye, standing up on his double bowed\r\nwhaling-boat brandishing the harpoon, darting it into the flank of a\r\nwhale, and paying out the rope. He must have been fine to see.\r\nGranted his passion for this business, I could not be surprised that\r\nhis discontent showed itself upon occasion.\r\n\r\nIn any case, however, our schooner was not fitted out for fishing, and \r\nthe implements of whaling were not on board.\r\n\r\nOne day, about three o\'clock in the afternoon, I had gone forward\r\nto watch the gambols of a "school" of the huge sea mammals.\r\nHearne was pointing them out to his companions, and muttering in\r\ndisjointed phrases,--\r\n\r\n"There, look there! That\'s a fin-back! There\'s another, and\r\nanother; three of them with their dorsal fins five or six feet high.\r\nJust see them swimming between two waves, quietly, making no jumps.\r\nAh! if I had a harpoon, I bet my head that I could send it into one\r\nof the four yellow spots they have on their bodies. But there\'s\r\nnothing to be done in this traffic-box; one cannot stretch one\'s\r\narms. Devil take it! In these seas it is fishing we ought to be at,\r\nnot--"\r\n\r\nThen, stopping short, he swore a few oaths, and cried out, "And\r\nthat other whale!"\r\n\r\n"The one with a hump like a dromedary?" asked a sailor.\r\n\r\n"Yes. It is a humpback," replied Hearne. "Do you make out its\r\nwrinkled belly, and also its long dorsal fin? They\'re not easy to\r\ntake, those humpbacks, for they go down into great depths and devour\r\nlong reaches of your lines. Truly, we deserve that he should give us\r\na switch of his tail on our side, since we don\'t send a harpoon\r\ninto his."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "There, look there! That\'s a fin-back!"]\r\n\r\n"Look out! Look out!" shouted the boatswain. This was not to\r\nwarn us that we were in danger of receiving the formidable stroke of\r\nthe humpback\'s tail which the sealing-master had wished us. No, an\r\nenormous blower had come alongside the schooner, and almost on the\r\ninstant a spout of ill-smelling water was ejected from its blow-hole\r\nwith a noise like a distant roar of artillery. The whole foredeck to\r\nthe main hatch was inundated.\r\n\r\n"That\'s well done!" growled Hearne, shrugging his shoulders,\r\nwhile his companions shook themselves and cursed the humpback.\r\n\r\nBesides these two kinds of cetacea we had observed several\r\nright-whales, and these are the most usually met with in the\r\nsouthern seas. They have no fins, and their blubber is very thick.\r\nThe taking of these fat monsters of the deep is not attended with\r\nmuch danger. The right-whales are vigorously pursued in the southern\r\nseas, where the little shell fish called "whales\' food"\r\nabound. The whales subsist entirely upon these small crustaceans.\r\n\r\nPresently, one of these right-whales, measuring sixty feet in\r\nlength--that is to say, the animal was the equivalent of a hundred\r\nbarrels of oil--was seen floating within three cables\' lengths of\r\nthe schooner.\r\n\r\n"Yes! that\'s a right-whale," exclaimed Hearne. "You might\r\ntell it by its thick, short spout. See, that one on the port side,\r\nlike a column of smoke, that\'s the spout of a right-whale! And all\r\nthis is passing before our very noses---a dead loss! Why, it\'s\r\nlike emptying money-bags into the sea not to fill one\'s barrels\r\nwhen one can. A nice sort of captain, indeed, to let all this\r\nmerchandise be lost, and do such wrong to his crew!"\r\n\r\n"Hearne," said an imperious voice, "go up to the maintop. You\r\nwill be more at your ease there to reckon the whales."\r\n\r\n"But, sir--"\r\n\r\n"No reply, or I\'ll keep you up there until to-morrow. Come--be\r\noff at once."\r\n\r\nAnd as he would have got the worst of an attempt at resistance, the\r\nsealing-master obeyed in silence.\r\n\r\nThe season must have been abnormally advanced, for although we\r\ncontinued to see a vast number of testaceans, we did not catch sight\r\nof a single whaling-ship in all this fishing-ground.\r\n\r\nI hasten to state that, although we were not to be tempted by\r\nwhales, no other fishing was forbidden on board the _Halbrane_, and\r\nour daily bill of fare profited by the boatswain\'s trawling lines,\r\nto the extreme satisfaction of stomachs weary of salt meat. Our\r\nlines brought us goby, salmon, cod, mackerel, conger, mullet, and\r\nparrot-fish.\r\n\r\nThe birds which we saw, and which came from every point of the\r\nhorizon, were those I have already mentioned, petrels, divers,\r\nhalcyons, and pigeons in countless flocks. I also saw--but beyond\r\naim--a giant petrel; its dimensions were truly astonishing. This\r\nwas one of those called "quebrantahnesos" by the Spaniards. This\r\nbird of the Magellanian waters is very remarkable; its curved and\r\nslender wings have a span of from thirteen to fourteen feet, equal\r\nto that of the wings of the great albatross. Nor is the latter\r\nwanting among these powerful winged creatures; we saw the\r\ndusky-plumed albatross of the cold latitudes, sweeping towards the\r\nglacial zone.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November, after observation taken at noon, it was\r\nfound that we had reached 66\xc2\xb0 23\' 3" of latitude.\r\n\r\nThe _Halbrane_ had then crossed the Polar Circle which circumscribes\r\nthe area of the Antarctic zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nBETWEEN THE POLAR CIRCLE AND THE ICE WALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the _Halbrane_ has passed beyond the imaginary curve drawn at\r\ntwenty-three and a half degrees from the Pole, it seems as though\r\nshe had entered a new region, "that region of Desolation and\r\nSilence," as Edgar Poe says; that magic person of splendour and\r\nglory in which the _Eleanora\'s_ singer longed to be shut up to all\r\neternity; that immense ocean of light ineffable.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief--to return to less fanciful hypotheses--that the\r\nAntarctic region, with a superficies of more than five millions of\r\nsquare miles, has remained what our spheroid was during the glacial\r\nperiod. In the summer, the southern zone, as we all know, enjoys\r\nperpetual day, owing to the rays projected by the orb of light above\r\nits horizon in his spiral ascent. Then, so soon as he has\r\ndisappeared, the long night sets in, a night which is frequently\r\nillumined by the polar aurora or Northern Lights.\r\n\r\nIt was then in the season of light that our schooner was about to\r\nsail in these formidable regions. The permanent brightness would not\r\nfail us before we should have reached Tsalal Island, where we felt\r\nno doubt of finding the men of the _Jane_.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Len Guy, West, and the old sailors of the crew learned\r\nthat the schooner had cleared the sixty-sixth parallel of latitude,\r\ntheir rough and sunburnt faces shone with satisfaction. The next\r\nday, Hurliguerly accosted me on the deck with a broad smile and a\r\ncheerful manner.\r\n\r\n"So then, Mr. Jeorling," said he, "we\'ve left the famous\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Circle\' behind us!"\r\n\r\n"Not far enough, boatswain, not far enough!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that will come! But I am disappointed."\r\n\r\n"In what way?"\r\n\r\n"Because we have not done what is usual on board ships on\r\ncrossing the Line!"\r\n\r\n"You regret that?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do, and the _Halbrane_ might have been allowed the\r\nceremony of a southern baptism."\r\n\r\n"A baptism? And whom would you have baptized, boatswain, seeing\r\nthat all our men, like yourself, have already sailed beyond this\r\nparallel?"\r\n\r\n"We! Oh, yes! But you! Oh, no, Mr. Jeorling. And why, may I ask,\r\nshould not that ceremony be performed in your honour?"\r\n\r\n"True, boatswain; this is the first time in the course of my\r\ntravels that I have been in so high a latitude."\r\n\r\n"And you should have been rewarded by a baptism, Mr. Jeorling.\r\nYes, indeed, but without any big fuss--no drum and trumpet about\r\nit, and leaving out old Father Neptune with his masquerade. If you\r\nwould permit me to baptize you--"\r\n\r\n"So be it, Hurliguerly," said I, putting my hand into my pocket.\r\n"Baptize as you please. Here is something to drink my health with at\r\nthe nearest tavern."\r\n\r\n"Then that will be Bennet Islet or Tsalal Island, provided there\r\nare any taverns in those savage islands, and any Atkinses to keep\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, boatswain--I always get back to Hunt--does he seem so\r\nmuch pleased to have passed the Polar Circle as the _Halbrane\'s_ old\r\nsailors are?"\r\n\r\n"Who knows? There\'s nothing to be got out of him one way or\r\nanother. But, as I have said before, if he has not already made\r\nacquaintance with the ice-barrier."\r\n\r\n"What makes you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Everything and nothing, Mr. Jeorling. One feels these things; one\r\ndoesn\'t think them. Hunt is an old sea-dog, who has carried his\r\ncanvas bag into every corner of the world."\r\n\r\nThe boatswain\'s opinion was mine also, and some inexplicable\r\npresentiment made me observe Hunt constantly, for he occupied a\r\nlarge share of my thoughts.\r\n\r\nEarly in December the wind showed a north-west tendency, and that\r\nwas not good for us, but we would have no serious right to complain\r\nso long as it did not blow due south-west. In the latter case the\r\nschooner would have been thrown out of her course, or at least she\r\nwould have had a struggle to keep in it, and it was better for us,\r\nin short, not to stray from the meridian which we had followed since\r\nour departure from the New South Orkneys. Captain Len Guy was made\r\nanxious by this alteration in the wind, and besides, the speed of\r\nthe _Halbrane_ was manifestly lessened, for the breeze began to soften\r\non the 4th, and in the middle of the night it died away.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the sails hung motionless and shrivelled along the\r\nmasts. Although not a breath reached us, and the surface of the\r\nocean was unruffled, the schooner was rocked from side to side by\r\nthe long oscillations of the swell coming from the west.\r\n\r\n"The sea feels something," said Captain Len Guy to me, "and\r\nthere must be rough weather on that side," he added, pointing\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\n"The horizon is misty," I replied; "but perhaps the sun\r\ntowards noon--"\r\n\r\n"The sun has no strength in this latitude, Mr. Jeorling, not even\r\nin summer. Jem!"\r\n\r\nWest came up to us.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of the sky?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think well of it. We must be ready for anything and\r\neverything, captain."\r\n\r\n"Has not the look-out given warning of the first drifting ice?"\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Captain Len Guy, "and if we get near the\r\nicebergs the damage will not be to them. Therefore, if prudence\r\ndemands that we should go either to the east or to the west, we\r\nshall resign ourselves, but only in case of absolute necessity."\r\n\r\nThe watch had made no mistake. In the afternoon we sighted masses,\r\nislets they might be called, of ice, drifting slowly southward, but\r\nthese were not yet of considerable extent or altitude. These packs\r\nwere easy to avoid; they could not interfere with the sailing of the\r\n_Halbrane_. But, although the wind had hitherto permitted her to keep\r\non her course, she was not advancing, and it was exceedingly\r\ndisagreeable to be rolling about in a rough and hollow sea which\r\nstruck our ship\'s sides most unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nAbout two o\'clock it was blowing a hurricane from all the points\r\nof the compass. The schooner was terribly knocked about, and the\r\nboatswain had the deck cleared of everything that was movable by her\r\nrolling and pitching.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the cargo could not be displaced, the stowage having\r\nbeen effected with perfect forecast of nautical eventualities. We\r\nhad not to dread the fate of the _Grampus_, which was lost owing to\r\nnegligence in her lading. It will be remembered that the brig turned\r\nbottom upwards, and that Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters remained for\r\nseveral days crouching on its keel.\r\n\r\nBesides, the schooner\'s pumps did not give a drop of water; the\r\nship was perfectly sound in every part, owing to the efficient\r\nrepairs that had been done during our stay at the Falklands. The\r\ntemperature had fallen rapidly, and hail, rain, and snow thickened\r\nand darkened the air. At ten o\'clock in the evening--I must use\r\nthis word, although the sun remained always above the horizon--the\r\ntempest increased, and the captain and his lieutenant, almost unable\r\nto hear each other\'s voices amid the elemental strife, communicated\r\nmostly by gestures, which is as good a mode as speech between sailors.\r\n\r\nI could not make up my mind to retire to my cabin, and, seeking the\r\nshelter of the roundhouse, I remained on deck, observing the weather\r\nphenomena, and the skill, certainty, celerity, and effect with which\r\nthe crew carried out the orders of the captain and West. It was a\r\nstrange and terrible experience for a landsman, even one who had\r\nseen so much of the sea and seamanship as I had. At the moment of a\r\ncertain difficult manoeuvre, four men had to climb to the crossbars\r\nof the fore-mast in order to reef the mainsail. The first who sprang\r\nto the ratlines was Hunt. The second was Martin Holt; Burry and one\r\nof the recruits followed them. I could not have believed that any\r\nman could display such skill and agility as Hunt\'s. His hands and\r\nfeet hardly caught the ratlines. Having reached the crossbars first,\r\nhe stretched himself on the ropes to the end of the yard, while Holt\r\nwent to the other end, and the two recruits remained in the middle.\r\n\r\nWhile the men were working, and the tempest was raging round us, a\r\nterrific lurch of the ship to starboard under the stroke of a\r\nmountainous wave, flung everything on the deck into wild confusion,\r\nand the sea rushed in through the scupper-holes. I was knocked down,\r\nand for some moments was unable to rise.\r\n\r\nSo great had been the incline of the schooner that the end of the\r\nyard of the mainsail was plunged three or four feet into the crest\r\nof a wave. When it emerged Martin Holt, who had been astride on it,\r\nhad disappeared. A cry was heard, uttered by the sailing-master,\r\nwhose arm could be seen wildly waving amid the whiteness of the\r\nfoam. The sailors rushed to the side and flung out one a rope,\r\nanother a cask, a third a spar--in short, any object of which\r\nMartin Holt might lay hold. At the moment when I struggled up to my\r\nfeet I caught sight of a massive substance which cleft the air and\r\nvanished in the whirl of the waves.\r\n\r\nWas this a second accident? No! it was a voluntary action, a deed of\r\nself-sacrifice. Having finished his task, Hunt had thrown himself\r\ninto the sea, that he might save Martin Holt.\r\n\r\n"Two men overboard!"\r\n\r\nYes, two--one to save the other. And were they not about to perish\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\nThe two heads rose to the foaming surface of the water. Hunt was\r\nswimming vigorously, cutting through the waves, and was nearing\r\nMartin Holt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hunt to the rescue.]\r\n\r\n"They are lost! both lost!" exclaimed the captain. "The boat,\r\nWest, the boat!"\r\n\r\n"If you give the order to lower it," answered West, "I will be\r\nthe first to get into it, although at the risk of my life. But I\r\nmust have the order."\r\n\r\nIn unspeakable suspense the ship\'s crew and myself had witnessed\r\nthis scene. None thought of the position of the _Halbrane_, which was\r\nsufficiently dangerous; all eyes were fixed upon the terrible waves.\r\nNow fresh cries, the frantic cheers of the crew, rose above the roar\r\nof the elements. Hunt had reached the drowning man just as he sank\r\nout of sight, had seized hold of him, and was supporting him with\r\nhis left arm, while Holt, incapable of movement, swayed helplessly\r\nabout like a weed. With the other arm Hunt was swimming bravely and\r\nmaking way towards the schooner.\r\n\r\nA minute, which seemed endless, passed. The two men, the one\r\ndragging the other, were hardly to be distinguished in the midst of\r\nthe surging waves.\r\n\r\nAt last Hunt reached the schooner, and caught one of the lines\r\nhanging over the side.\r\n\r\nIn a minute Hunt and Martin Holt were hoisted on board; the latter\r\nwas laid down at the foot of the fore-mast, and the former was quite\r\nready to go to his work. Holt was speedily restored by the aid of\r\nvigorous rubbing; his senses came back, and he opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Martin Holt," said Captain Len Guy, who was leaning over him,\r\n"you have been brought back from very far--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, captain," answered Holt, as he looked about him with\r\na searching gaze, "but who saved me?"\r\n\r\n"Hunt," cried the boatswain, "Hunt risked his life for you."\r\n\r\nAs the latter was hanging back, Hurliguerly pushed him towards\r\nMartin Holt, whose eyes expressed the liveliest gratitude.\r\n\r\n"Hunt," said he, "you have saved me. But for you I should have\r\nbeen lost. I thank you."\r\n\r\nHunt made no reply.\r\n\r\n"Hunt," resumed Captain Len Guy, "don\'t you hear?"\r\n\r\nThe man seemed not to have heard.\r\n\r\n"Hunt," said Martin Holt again, "come near to me. I thank you.\r\nI want to shake hands with you."\r\n\r\nAnd he held out his right hand. Hunt stepped back a few paces,\r\nshaking his head with the air of a man who did not want so many\r\ncompliments for a thing so simple, and quietly walked forward to\r\njoin his shipmates, who were working vigorously under the orders of\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nDecidedly, this man was a hero in courage and self-devotion; but\r\nequally decidedly he was a being impervious to impressions, and not\r\non that day either was the boatswain destined to know "the colour\r\nof his words!"\r\n\r\nFor three whole days, the 6th, 7th, and 8th of December, the tempest\r\nraged in these waters, accompanied by snow storms which perceptibly\r\nlowered the temperature. It is needless to say that Captain Len Guy\r\nproved himself a true seaman, that James West had an eye to\r\neverything, that the crew seconded them loyally, and that Hunt was\r\nalways foremost when there was work to be done or danger to be\r\nincurred.\r\n\r\nIn truth, I do not know how to give an idea of this man! What a\r\ndifference there was between him and most of the sailors recruited\r\nat the Falklands, and especially between him and Hearne, the\r\nsealing-master! They obeyed, no doubt, for such a master as James\r\nWest gets himself obeyed, whether with good or ill will. But behind\r\nbacks what complaints were made, what recriminations were exchanged!\r\nAll this, I feared, was of evil presage for the future.\r\n\r\nMartin Holt had been able to resume his duties very soon, and he\r\nfulfilled them with hearty good-will. He knew the business of a\r\nsailor right well, and was the only man on board who could compete\r\nwith Hunt in handiness and zeal.\r\n\r\n"Well, Holt," said I to him one day when he was talking with the\r\nboatswain, "what terms are you on with that queer fellow Hunt now?\r\nSince the salvage affair, is he a little more communicative?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Jeorling, and I think he even tries to avoid me."\r\n\r\n"To avoid you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he did so before, for that matter."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, that is true," added Hurliguerly; "I have made\r\nthe same remark more than once."\r\n\r\n"Then he keeps aloof from you, Holt, as from the others?"\r\n\r\n"From me more than from the others."\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\nI was surprised at what the two men had said, but a little\r\nobservation convinced me that Hunt actually did avoid every occasion\r\nof coming in contact with Martin Holt. Did he not think that he had\r\na right to Holt\'s gratitude although the latter owed his life to\r\nhim? This man\'s conduct was certainly very strange.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning of the 9th the wind showed a tendency to change\r\nin the direction of the east, which would mean more manageable\r\nweather for us. And, in fact, although the sea still remained rough,\r\nat about two in the morning it became feasible to put on more sail\r\nwithout risk, and thus the _Halbrane_ regained the course from which\r\nshe had been driven by the prolonged tempest.\r\n\r\nIn that portion of the Antarctic sea the ice-packs were more\r\nnumerous, and there was reason to believe that the tempest, by\r\nhastening the smash-up, had broken the barrier of the iceberg wall\r\ntowards the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nALONG THE FRONT OF THE ICEBERGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the seas beyond the Polar Circle were wildly tumultuous, it\r\nis but just to acknowledge that our navigation had been accomplished\r\nso far under exceptional conditions. And what good luck it would be\r\nif the _Halbrane_, in this first fortnight of December, were to find\r\nthe Weddell route open!\r\n\r\nThere! I am talking of the Weddell route as though it were a\r\nmacadamized road, well kept, with mile-stones and "This way to the\r\nSouth Pole" on a signpost!\r\n\r\nThe numerous wandering masses of ice gave our men no trouble; they\r\nwere easily avoided. It seemed likely that no real difficulties\r\nwould arise until the schooner should have to try to make a passage\r\nfor herself through the icebergs.\r\n\r\nBesides, there was no surprise to be feared. The presence of ice was\r\nindicated by a yellowish tint in the atmosphere, which the whalers\r\ncalled "blink." This is a phenomenon peculiar to the glacial\r\nzones which never deceives the observer.\r\n\r\nFor five successive days the _Halbrane_ sailed without sustaining any\r\ndamage, without having, even for a moment, had to fear a collision.\r\nIt is true that in  proportion as she advanced towards the south the\r\nnumber of ice-packs increased and the channels became narrower. On\r\nthe 14th an observation gave us 72\xc2\xb0 37\' for latitude, our\r\nlongitude remaining the same, between the forty-second and the\r\nforty-third meridian. This was already a point beyond the Antarctic\r\nCircle that few navigators had been able to reach. We were at only\r\ntwo degrees lower than Weddell.\r\n\r\nThe navigation of the schooner naturally became a more delicate\r\nmatter in the midst of those dim, wan masses soiled with the excreta\r\nof birds. Many of them had a leprous look: compared with their\r\nalready considerable volume, how small our little ship, over whose\r\nmast some of the icebergs already towered, must have appeared!\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy admirably combined boldness and prudence in his\r\ncommand of his ship. He never passed to leeward of an iceberg, if\r\nthe distance did not guarantee the success of any manoeuvre\r\nwhatsoever that might suddenly become necessary. He was familiar\r\nwith all the contingencies of ice-navigation, and was not afraid to\r\nventure into the midst of these flotillas of drifts and packs. That\r\nday he said to me,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling, this is not the first time that I have tried to\r\npenetrate into the Polar Sea, and without success. Well, if I made\r\nthe attempt to do this when I had nothing but presumption as to the\r\nfate of the _Jane_ to go upon, what shall I not do now that\r\npresumption is changed into certainty?"\r\n\r\n"I understand that, captain, and of course your experience of\r\nnavigation in these waters must increase our chances of success."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly. Nevertheless, all that lies beyond the fixed\r\nicebergs is still the Unknown for me, as it is for other\r\nnavigators."\r\n\r\n"The Unknown! No, not absolutely, captain, since we possess the\r\nimportant reports of Weddell, and, I must add, of Arthur Pym also."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know; they have spoken of the open sea."\r\n\r\n"Do you not believe that such a sea exists?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do believe that it exists, and for valid reasons. In fact,\r\nit is perfectly manifest that these masses, called icebergs and\r\nice-fields, could not be formed in the ocean itself. It is the\r\ntremendous and irresistible action of the surge which detaches them\r\nfrom the continents or islands of the high latitudes. Then the\r\ncurrents carry them into less cold waters, where their edges are\r\nworn by the waves, while the temperature disintegrates their bases\r\nand their sides, which are subjected to thermometric influences."\r\n\r\n"That seems very plain," I replied. "Then these masses have\r\ncome from the icebergs.(1) They clash with them in drifting,\r\nsometimes break into the main body, and clear their passage through.\r\nAgain, we must not judge the southern by the northern zone. The\r\nconditions are not identical. Cook has recorded that he never met\r\nthe equivalent of the Antarctic ice mountains in the Greenland seas,\r\neven at a higher latitude."\r\n\r\n"What is the reason?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No doubt that the influence of the south winds is predominant in\r\nthe northern regions. Now, those winds do not reach the northern\r\nregions until they have been heated in their passage over America,\r\nAsia, and Europe, and they contribute to raise the temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere. The nearest land, ending in the points of the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, Patagonia, and Tasmania, does not modify the\r\natmospheric currents."\r\n\r\n"That is an important observation, captain, and it justifies your\r\nopinion with regard to an open sea."\r\n\r\n"Yes, open--at least, for ten degrees behind the icebergs. Let us\r\nthen only get through that obstacle, and our greatest difficulty\r\nwill have been conquered. You were right in saying that the\r\nexistence of that open sea has been formally recognized by\r\nWeddell."\r\n\r\n"And by Arthur Pym, captain."\r\n\r\n"And by Arthur Pym."\r\n\r\nFrom the 15th of December the difficulties of navigation increased\r\nwith the number of the drifting masses. The wind, however, continued\r\nto be uniformly favourable, showing no tendency to veer to the\r\nsouth. The breeze freshened now and then, and we had to take in\r\nsail. When this occurred we saw the sea foaming along the sides of\r\nthe ice packs, covering them with spray like the rocks on the coast\r\nof a floating island, but without hindering their onward march.\r\n\r\nOur crew could not fail to be impressed by the sight of the\r\nschooner making her way through these moving masses; the new men\r\namong them, at least, for the old hands had seen such manoeuvres\r\nbefore. But they soon became accustomed to it, and took it all for\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to organize the look-out ahead with the greatest\r\ncare. West had a cask fixed at the head of the foremast--what is\r\ncalled a crow\'s-nest--and from thence an unremitting watch was\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nThe 16th was a day of excessive fatigue to the men. The packs and\r\ndrifts were so close that only very narrow and winding passage-way\r\nbetween them was to be found, so that the working of the ship was\r\nmore than commonly laborious.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, none of the men grumbled, but Hunt\r\ndistinguished himself by his activity. Indeed, he was admitted by\r\nCaptain Len Guy and the crew to be an incomparable seaman. But there\r\nwas something mysterious about him that excited the curiosity of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nAt this date the _Halbrane_ could not be very far from the icebergs.\r\nIf she held on in her course in that direction she would certainly\r\nreach them before long, and would then have only to seek for a\r\npassage. Hitherto, however, the look-out had not been able to make\r\nout between the icebergs an unbroken crest of ice beyond the\r\nice-fields.\r\n\r\nConstant and minute precautions were indispensable all day on the\r\n16th, for the helm, which was loosened by merciless blows and bumps,\r\nwas in danger of being unshipped.\r\n\r\nThe sea mammals had not forsaken these seas. Whales were seen in\r\ngreat numbers, and it was a fairy-like spectacle when several of\r\nthem spouted simultaneously. With fin-backs and hump-backs,\r\nporpoises of colossal size appeared, and these Hearne harpooned\r\ncleverly when they came within range. The flesh of these creatures\r\nwas much relished on board, after Endicott had cooked it in his best\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nAs for the usual Antarctic birds, petrels, pigeons, and cormorants,\r\nthey passed in screaming flocks, and legions of penguins, ranged\r\nalong the edges of the ice-fields, watched the evolutions of the\r\nschooner. These penguins are the real inhabitants of these dismal\r\nsolitudes, and nature could not have created a type more suited to\r\nthe desolation of the glacial zone.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 17th the man in the crow\'s-nest at last\r\nsignalled the icebergs.\r\n\r\nFive or six miles to the south a long dentated crest upreared\r\nitself, plainly standing out against the fairly clear sky, and all\r\nalong it drifted thousands of ice-packs. This motionless barrier\r\nstretched before us from the north-west to the south-east, and by\r\nmerely sailing along it the schooner would still gain some degrees\r\nsouthwards.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Halbrane_ was within three miles of the icebergs, she lay-to\r\nin the middle of a wide basin which allowed her complete freedom of\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nA boat was lowered, and Captain Len Guy got into it, with the\r\nboatswain, four sailors at the oars, and one at the helm. The boat\r\nwas pulled in the direction of the enormous rampart, vain search was\r\nmade for a channel through which the schooner could have slipped,\r\nand after three hours of this fatiguing reconnoitring, the men\r\nreturned to the ship. Then came a squall of rain and snow which\r\ncaused the temperature to fall to thirty-six degrees (2\xc2\xb022 C.\r\nabove zero), and shut out the view of the ice-rampart from us.\r\n\r\nDuring the next twenty-four hours the schooner lay within four miles\r\nof the icebergs. To bring her nearer would have been to get among\r\nwinding channels from which it might not have been possible to\r\nextricate her. Not that Captain Len Guy did not long to do this, in\r\nhis fear of passing some opening unperceived.\r\n\r\n"If I had a consort," he said, "I would sail closer along the\r\nicebergs, and it is a great advantage to be two, when one is on such\r\nan enterprise as this! But the _Halbrane_ is alone, and if she were to\r\nfail us--"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Four sailors at the oars, and one at the helm.]\r\n\r\nEven though we approached no nearer to the icebergs than prudence\r\npermitted, our ship was exposed to great risk, and West was\r\nconstantly obliged to change his trim in order to avoid the shock of\r\nan icefield.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the wind blew from east to north-nor\'-east without\r\nvariation, and it did not freshen. Had a tempest arisen I know not\r\nwhat would have become of the schooner--yes, though, I do know too\r\nwell: she would have been lost and all on board of her. In such a\r\ncase the _Halbrane_ could not have escaped; we must have been flung on\r\nthe base of the barrier.\r\n\r\nAfter a long examination Captain Len Guy had to renounce the hope\r\nof finding a passage through the terrible wall of ice. It remained\r\nonly to endeavour to reach the south-east point of it. At any rate,\r\nby following that course we lost nothing in latitude; and, in fact,\r\non the 18th the observation taken made the seventy-third parallel\r\nthe position of the _Halbrane_.\r\n\r\nI must repeat, however, that navigation in the Antarctic seas will\r\nprobably never be accomplished under more felicitous\r\ncircumstances--the precocity of the summer season, the permanence\r\nof the north wind, the temperature forty-nine degrees at the lowest;\r\nall this was the best of good-fortune. I need not add that we\r\nenjoyed perpetual light, and the whole twenty-four hours round the\r\nsun\'s rays reached us from every point of the horizon.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times the captain approached within two miles of the\r\nicebergs. It was impossible but that the vast mass must have been\r\nsubjected to climateric influences; ruptures must surely have taken\r\nplace at some points.\r\n\r\nBut his search had no result, and we had to fall back into the\r\ncurrent from west to east.\r\n\r\nI must observe at this point that during all our search we never\r\ndescried land or the appearance of land out at sea, as indicated on\r\nthe charts of preceding navigators. These maps are incomplete, no\r\ndoubt, but sufficiently exact in their main lines. I am aware that\r\nships have often passed over the indicated bearings of land. This,\r\nhowever, was not admissible in the case of Tsalal. If the _Jane_ had\r\nbeen able to reach the islands, it was because that portion of the\r\nAntarctic sea was free, and in so "early" a year, we need not\r\nfear any obstacle in that direction.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 19th, between two and three o\'clock in the\r\nafternoon, a shout from the crow\'s-nest was heard.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" roared West.\r\n\r\n"The iceberg wall is split on the south-east."\r\n\r\n"What is beyond?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing in sight."\r\n\r\nIt took West very little time to reach the point of observation, and\r\nwe all waited below, how impatiently may be imagined. What if the\r\nlook-out were mistaken, if some optical delusion?---- But West, at all\r\nevents, would make no mistake.\r\n\r\nAfter ten interminable minutes his clear voice reached us on the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\n"Open sea!" he cried.\r\n\r\nUnanimous cheers made answer.\r\n\r\nThe schooner\'s head was put to the south-east, hugging the wind as\r\nmuch as possible.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later we had doubled the extremity of the ice-barrier, and\r\nthere lay before our eyes a sparkling sea, entirely open.\r\n\r\n(1) The French word is _banquise_, which means the vast stretch of\r\nicebergs farther south than the _barri\xc3\xa8re_ or ice-wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nA VOICE IN A DREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntirely free from ice? No. It would have been premature to affirm\r\nthis as a fact. A few icebergs were visible in the distance, while\r\nsome drifts and packs were still going east. Nevertheless, the\r\nbreak-up had been very thorough on that side, and the sea was in\r\nreality open, since a ship could sail freely.\r\n\r\n"God has come to our aid," said Captain Len Guy. "May He be\r\npleased to guide us to the end."\r\n\r\n"In a week," I remarked, "our schooner might come in sight of\r\nTsalal Island."\r\n\r\n"Provided that the east wind lasts, Mr. Jeorling. Don\'t forget\r\nthat in sailing along the icebergs to their eastern extremity, the\r\n_Halbrane_ went out of her course, and she must be brought back\r\ntowards the west."\r\n\r\n"The breeze is for us, captain."\r\n\r\n"And we shall profit by it, for my intention is to make for Bennet\r\nIslet. It was there that my brother first landed, and so soon as we\r\nshall have sighted that island we shall be certain that we are on\r\nthe right route. To-day, when I have ascertained our position\r\nexactly, we shall steer for Bennet Islet."\r\n\r\n"Who knows but that we may come upon some fresh sign?"\r\n\r\n"It is not impossible, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\nI need not say that recourse was had to the surest guide within our\r\nreach, that veracious narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, which I read\r\nand re-read with intense attention, fascinated as I was by the idea\r\nthat I might be permitted to behold with my own eyes those strange\r\nphenomena of nature in the Antarctic world which I, in common with\r\nall Edgar Poe\'s readers, had hitherto regarded as creations of the\r\nmost imaginative writer who ever gave voice by his pen to the\r\nphantasies of a unique brain. No doubt a great part of the wonders\r\nof Arthur Gordon Pym\'s narrative would prove pure fiction, but if\r\neven a little of the marvellous story were found to be true, how\r\ngreat a privilege would be mine!\r\n\r\nThe picturesque and wonderful side of the story we were studying as\r\ngospel truth had little charm and but slight interest for Captain\r\nLen Guy; he was indifferent to everything in Pym\'s narrative that\r\ndid not relate directly to the castaways of Tsalal Island: his mind\r\nwas solely and constantly set upon their rescue.\r\n\r\nAccording to the narrative of Arthur Pym, the _Jane_ experienced\r\nserious difficulties, due to bad weather, from the 1st to the 4th of\r\nJanuary, 1828. It was not until the morning of the 5th, in latitude\r\n73\xc2\xb0 15\', that she found a free passage through the last iceberg\r\nthat barred her way. The final difference between our position and\r\nthe _Jane_ in a parallel case, was that the _Jane_ took fifteen days to\r\naccomplish the distance of ten degrees, or six hundred miles, which\r\nseparated her on the 5th of January from Tsalal Island, while on the\r\n19th of December the _Halbrane_ was only about seven degrees, or four\r\nhundred miles, off the island. Bennet Islet, where Captain Guy\r\nintended to put in for twenty-four hours, was fifty miles nearer.\r\nOur voyage was progressing under prosperous conditions; we were no\r\nlonger visited by sudden hail and snow storms, or those rapid falls\r\nof temperature which tried the crew of the _Jane_ so sorely. A few\r\nice-floes drifted by us, occasionally peopled, as tourists throng a\r\npleasure yacht, by penguins, and also by dusky seals, lying flat\r\nupon the white surfaces like enormous leeches. Above this strange\r\nflotilla we traced the incessant flight of petrels, pigeons, black\r\npuffins, divers, grebe, sterns, cormorants, and the sooty-black\r\nalbatross of the high latitudes. Huge medus\xc3\xa6, exquisitely tinted,\r\nfloated on the water like spread parasols. Among the denizens of the\r\ndeep, captured by the crew of the schooner with line and net, I\r\nnoted more particularly a sort of giant John Dory(1) (_dorade_) three\r\nfeet in length, with firm and savoury flesh.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, or rather what ought to have been the night of the\r\n19th-20th, my sleep was disturbed by a strange dream. Yes! there\r\ncould be no doubt but that it was only a dream! Nevertheless, I\r\nthink it well to record it here, because it is an additional\r\ntestimony to the haunting influence under which my brain was\r\nbeginning to labour.\r\n\r\nI was sleeping--at two hours after midnight--and was awakened by a\r\nplaintive and continuous murmuring sound. I opened--or I imagined I\r\nopened my eyes. My cabin was in profound darkness. The murmur began\r\nagain; I listened, and it seemed to me that a voice--a voice which\r\nI did not know--whispered these words:--\r\n\r\n"Pym . . . Pym . . . poor Pym!"\r\n\r\nEvidently this could only be a delusion; unless, indeed, some one\r\nhad got into my cabin: the door was not locked.\r\n\r\n"Pym!" the voice repeated. "Poor Pym must never be\r\nforgotten."\r\n\r\nThis time the words were spoken close to my ear. What was the\r\nmeaning of the injunction, and why was it addressed to me? And\r\nbesides, had not Pym, after his return to America, met with a sudden\r\nand deplorable death, the circumstances or the details being unknown?\r\n\r\nI began to doubt whether I was in my right mind, and shook myself\r\ninto complete wakefulness, recognizing that I had been disturbed by\r\nan extremely vivid dream due to some cerebral cause.\r\n\r\nI turned out of my berth, and, pushing back the shutter, looked out\r\nof my cabin. No one aft on the deck, except Hunt, who was at the\r\nhelm.\r\n\r\nI had nothing to do but to lie down again, and this I did. It seemed\r\nto me that the name of Arthur Pym was repeated in my hearing several\r\ntimes; nevertheless, I fell asleep and did not wake until morning,\r\nwhen I retained only a vague impression of this occurrence, which\r\nsoon faded away. No other incident at that period of our voyage\r\ncalls for notice. Nothing particular occurred on board our schooner.\r\nThe breeze from the north, which had forsaken us, did not recur, and\r\nonly the current carried the _Halbrane_ towards the south. This caused\r\na delay unbearable to our impatience.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 21st, the usual observation gave 82\xc2\xb0 50\' of\r\nlatitude, and 42\xc2\xb0 20\' of west longitude. Bennet Islet, if it had\r\nany existence, could not be far off now.\r\n\r\nYes! the islet did exist, and its bearings were those indicated by\r\nArthur Pym.\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock in the evening one of the crew cried out that there\r\nwas land ahead on the port side.\r\n\r\n(1) The legendary etymology of this piscatorial designation is\r\n_Janitore_, the "door-keeper," in allusion to St. Peter, who\r\nbrought a fish, said to be of that species, to our Lord at His\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nBENNET ISLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Halbrane_ was then within sight of Bennet Islet! The crew\r\nurgently needed rest, so the disembarkation was deferred until the\r\nfollowing day, and I went back to my cabin.\r\n\r\nThe night passed without disturbance, and when day came not a craft\r\nof any kind was visible on the waters, not a native on the beach.\r\nThere were no huts upon the coast, no smoke arose in the distance to\r\nindicate that Bennet Islet was inhabited. But William Guy had not\r\nfound any trace of human beings there, and what I saw of the islet\r\nanswered to the description given by Arthur Pym. It rose upon a\r\nrocky base of about a league in circumference, and was so arid that\r\nno vegetation existed on its surface.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling," said Captain Len Guy, "do you observe a\r\npromontory in the direction of the north-east?"\r\n\r\n"I observe it, captain."\r\n\r\n"Is it not formed of heaped-up rocks which look like giant bales\r\nof cotton?"\r\n\r\n"That is so, and just what the narrative describes."\r\n\r\n"Then all we have to do is to land on the promontory, Mr. Jeorling.\r\nWho knows but we may come across some vestige of the crew of the\r\n_Jane_, supposing them to have succeeded in escaping from Tsalal\r\nIsland."\r\n\r\nThe speaker was devouring the islet with his eyes. What must his\r\nthoughts, his desires, his impatience have been! But there was a man\r\nwhose gaze was set upon the same point even more fixedly; that man\r\nwas Hunt.\r\n\r\nBefore we left the _Halbrane_ Len Guy enjoined the most minute and\r\ncareful watchfulness upon his lieutenant. This was a charge which\r\nWest did not need. Our exploration would take only half a day at\r\nmost. If the boat had not returned in the afternoon a second was to\r\nbe sent in search of us.\r\n\r\n"Look sharp also after our recruits," added the captain.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be uneasy, captain," replied the lieutenant. "Indeed,\r\nsince you want four men at the oars you had better take them from\r\namong the new ones. That will leave four less troublesome fellows on\r\nboard."\r\n\r\nThis was a good idea, for, under the deplorable influence of Hearne,\r\nthe discontent of his shipmates from the Falklands was on the\r\nincrease. The boat being ready, four of the new crew took their\r\nplaces forward, while Hunt, at his own request, was steersman.\r\nCaptain Len Guy, the boatswain and myself, all well armed, seated\r\nourselves aft, and we started for the northern point of the islet.\r\nIn the course of an hour we had doubled the promontory, and come in\r\nsight of the little bay whose shores the boats of the _Jane_ had\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nHunt steered for this bay, gliding with remarkable skill between the\r\nrocky points which stuck up here and there. One would have thought\r\nhe knew his way among them.\r\n\r\nWe disembarked on a stony coast. The stones were covered with sparse\r\nlichen. The tide was already ebbing, leaving uncovered the sandy\r\nbottom of a sort of beach strewn with black blocks, resembling big\r\nnail-heads.\r\n\r\nTwo men were left in charge of the boat while we landed amid the\r\nrocks, and, accompanied by the other two, Captain Len Guy, the\r\nboatswain, Hunt and I proceeded towards the centre, where we found\r\nsome rising ground, from whence we could see the whole extent of the\r\nislet. But there was nothing to be seen on any side, absolutely\r\nnothing. On coming down from the slight eminence Hunt went on in\r\nfront, as it had been agreed that he was to be our guide. We\r\nfollowed him therefore, as he led us towards the southern extremity\r\nof the islet. Having reached the point, Hunt looked carefully on all\r\nsides of him, then stooped and showed us a piece of half rotten wood\r\nlying among the scattered stones.\r\n\r\n"I remember!" I exclaimed; "Arthur Pym speaks of a piece of\r\nwood with traces of carving on it which appeared to have belonged to\r\nthe bow of a ship."\r\n\r\n"Among the carving my brother fancied he could trace the design of\r\na tortoise," added Captain Len Guy.\r\n\r\n"Just so," I replied, "but Arthur Pym pronounced that\r\nresemblance doubtful. No matter; the piece of wood is still in the\r\nsame place that is indicated in the narrative, so we may conclude\r\nthat since the _Jane_ cast anchor here no other crew has ever set foot\r\nupon Bennet Islet. It follows that we should only lose time in\r\nlooking out for any tokens of another landing. We shall know nothing\r\nuntil we reach Tsalal Island."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Tsalal Island," replied the captain.\r\n\r\nWe then retraced our steps in the direction of the bay. In various\r\nplaces we observed fragments of coral reef, and b\xc3\xaache-de-mer was so\r\nabundant that our schooner might have taken a full cargo of it.\r\n\r\nHunt walked on in silence with downcast eyes, until as we were close\r\nupon the beach to the east, he, being about ten paces ahead, stopped\r\nabruptly, and summoned us to him by a hurried gesture.\r\n\r\nIn an instant we were by his side. Hunt had evinced no surprise on\r\nthe subject of the piece of wood first found, but his attitude\r\nchanged when he knelt down in front of a worm-eaten plank lying on\r\nthe sand. He felt it all over with his huge hands, as though he were\r\nseeking some tracery on its rough surface whose signification might\r\nbe intelligible to him. The black paint was hidden under the thick\r\ndirt that had accumulated upon it. The plank had probably formed\r\npart of a ship\'s stern, as the boatswain requested us to observe.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," repeated Captain Len Guy, "it made part of a\r\nstern."\r\n\r\nHunt, who still remained kneeling, nodded his big head in assent.\r\n\r\n"But," I remarked, "this plank must have been cast upon Bennet\r\nIslet from a wreck! The cross-currents must have found it in the\r\nopen sea, and--"\r\n\r\n"If that were so--" cried the captain.\r\n\r\nThe same thought had occurred to both of us. What was our surprise,\r\nindeed our amazement, our unspeakable emotion, when Hunt showed us\r\neight letters cut in the plank, not painted, but hollow and\r\ndistinctly traceable with the finger.\r\n\r\nIt was only too easy to recognize the letters of two names, arranged\r\nin two lines, thus:\r\n\r\n  AN\r\n  LI.E.PO.L.\r\n\r\nThe _Jane of Liverpool_! The schooner commanded by Captain William\r\nGuy! What did it matter that time had blurred the other letters?\r\nDid not those suffice to tell the name of the ship and the port she\r\nbelonged to? The _Jane_ of Liverpool!\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy had taken the plank in his hands, and now he pressed\r\nhis lips to it, while tears fell from his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was a fragment of the _Jane_! I did not utter a word until the\r\ncaptain\'s emotion had subsided. As for Hunt, I had never seen such\r\na lightning glance from his brilliant hawk-like eyes as he now cast\r\ntowards the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy rose.\r\n\r\nHunt, without a word, placed the plank upon his shoulder, and we\r\ncontinued our route.\r\n\r\nWhen we had made the tour of the island, we halted at the place\r\nwhere the boat had been left under the charge of two sailors, and\r\nabout half-past two in the afternoon we were again on board.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 23rd of December the _Halbrane_ put off\r\nfrom Bennet Islet, and we carried away with us new and convincing\r\ntestimony to the catastrophe which Tsalal Island had witnessed.\r\n\r\nDuring that day, I observed the sea water very attentively, and it\r\nseemed to me less deeply blue than Arthur Pym describes it. Nor had\r\nwe met a single specimen of his monster of the austral fauna, an\r\nanimal three feet long, six inches high, with four short legs, long\r\ncoral claws, a silky body, a rat\'s tail, a cat\'s head, the\r\nhanging ears, blood-red lips and white teeth of a dog. The truth is\r\nthat I regarded several of these details as "suspect," and\r\nentirely due to an over-imaginative temperament.\r\n\r\nSeated far aft in the ship, I read Edgar Poe\'s book with sedulous\r\nattention, but I was not unaware of the fact that Hunt, whenever his\r\nduties furnished him with an opportunity, observed me pertinaciously,\r\nand with looks of singular meaning.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, I was re-perusing the end of Chapter XVII., in which\r\nArthur Pym acknowledged his responsibility for the sad and tragic\r\nevents which were the results of his advice. It was, in fact, he who\r\nover-persuaded Captain William Guy, urging him "to profit by so\r\ntempting an opportunity of solving the great problem relating to the\r\nAntarctic Continent." And, besides, while accepting that\r\nresponsibility, did he not congratulate himself on having been the\r\ninstrument of a great discovery, and having aided in some degree to\r\nreveal to science one of the most marvellous secrets which had ever\r\nclaimed its attention?\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock the sun disappeared behind a thick curtain of mist.\r\nAfter midnight the breeze freshened, and the _Halbrane\'s_ progress\r\nmarked a dozen additional miles.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the good ship was less than the third of a degree,\r\nthat is to say less than twenty miles, from Tsalal Island.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, just after mid-day, the wind fell. Nevertheless,\r\nthanks to the current, the Island of Tsalal was signalled at\r\nforty-five minutes past six in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe anchor was cast, a watch was set, with loaded firearms within\r\nhand-reach, and boarding-nets ready.\r\n\r\nThe _Halbrane_ ran no risk of being surprised. Too many eyes were \r\nwatching on board--especially those of Hunt, whose gaze never \r\nquitted the horizon of that southern zone for an instant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nTSALAL ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night passed without alarm. No boat had put off from the island,\r\nnor had a native shown himself upon the beach. The _Halbrane_, then,\r\nhad not been observed on her arrival; this was all the better.\r\n\r\nWe had cast anchor in ten fathoms, at three miles from the coast.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Jane_ appeared in these waters, the people of Tsalal beheld\r\na ship for the first time, and they took it for an enormous animal,\r\nregarding its masts as limbs, and its sails as garments. Now, they\r\nought to be better informed on this subject, and if they did not\r\nattempt to visit us, to what motive were we to assign such conduct?\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy gave orders for the lowering of the ship\'s largest\r\nboat, in a voice which betrayed his impatience.\r\n\r\nThe order was executed, and the captain, addressing West, said,--\r\n\r\n"Send eight men down with Martin Holt; send Hunt to the helm.\r\nRemain yourself at the moorings, and keep a look-out landwards as\r\nwell as to sea."\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye, sir; don\'t be uneasy."\r\n\r\n"We are going ashore, and we shall try to gain the village of\r\nKlock-Klock. If any difficulty should arise on sea, give us warning\r\nby firing three shots."\r\n\r\n"All right," replied West--"at a minute\'s interval."\r\n\r\n"If we should not return before evening, send the second boat with\r\nten armed men under the boatswain\'s orders, and let them station\r\nthemselves within a cable\'s length of the shore, so as to escort\r\nus back. You understand?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly, captain."\r\n\r\n"If we are not to be found, after you have done all in your power,\r\nyou will take command of the schooner, and bring her back to the\r\nFalklands."\r\n\r\n"I will do so."\r\n\r\nThe large boat was rapidly got ready. Eight men embarked in it,\r\nincluding Martin Holt and Hunt, all armed with rifles, pistols, and\r\nknives; the latter weapons were slung in their belts. They also\r\ncarried cartridge-pouches.\r\n\r\nI stepped forward and said,--\r\n\r\n"Will you not allow me to accompany you, captain?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish to do so, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\nI went to my cabin, took my gun--a repeating rifle--with ball and\r\npowder, and rejoined Captain Len Guy, who had kept a place in the\r\nstern of the boat for me. Our object was to discover the passage\r\nthrough which Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters had crossed the reef on the\r\n19th of January, 1828, in the _Jane\'s_ boat. For twenty minutes we\r\nrowed along the reef, and then Hunt discovered the pass, which was\r\nthrough a narrow cut in the rocks. Leaving two men in the boat, we\r\nlanded, and having gone through the winding gorge which gave access\r\nto the crest of the coast, our little force, headed by Hunt, pushed\r\non towards the centre of the island. Captain Len Guy and myself\r\nexchanged observations, as we walked, on the subject of this\r\ncountry, which, as Arthur Pym declared, differed essentially from\r\nevery other land hitherto visited by human beings. We soon found\r\nthat Pym\'s description was trustworthy. The general colour of the\r\nplains was black, as though the clay were made of lava-dust; nowhere\r\nwas anything white to be seen. At a hundred paces\' distance Hunt\r\nbegan to run towards an enormous mass of rock, climbed on it with\r\ngreat agility, and looked out over a wide extent of space like a man\r\nwho ought to recognize the place he is in, but does not.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with him?" asked Captain Len Guy, who was\r\nobserving Hunt attentively.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what is the matter with him, captain. But, as you\r\nare aware, everything about this man is odd: his ways are\r\ninexplicable, and on certain sides of him he seems to belong to\r\nthose strange beings whom Arthur Pym asserts that he found on this\r\nisland. One would even say that--"\r\n\r\n"That--" repeated the captain.\r\n\r\nAnd then, without finishing my sentence, I said,--\r\n\r\n"Captain, are you sure that you made a good observation when you\r\ntook the altitude yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"So that your point--"\r\n\r\n"Gave 83\xc2\xb0 20\' of latitude and 43\xc2\xb0 5\' of longitude."\r\n\r\n"Exactly?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"There is, then, no doubt that we are on Tsalal Island?"\r\n\r\n"None, Mr. Jeorling, if Tsalal Island lies where Arthur Pym places\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThis was quite true, there could be no doubt on the point, and yet\r\nof all that Arthur Pym described nothing existed, or rather, nothing\r\nwas any longer to be seen. Not a tree, not a shrub, not a plant was\r\nvisible in the landscape. There was no sign of the wooded hills\r\nbetween which the village of Klock-Klock ought to lie, or of the\r\nstreams from which the crew of the _Jane_ had not ventured to drink.\r\nThere was no water anywhere; but everywhere absolute, awful drought.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Hunt walked on rapidly, without showing any\r\nhesitation. It seemed as though he was led by a natural instinct,\r\n"a bee\'s flight," as we say in America. I know not what\r\npresentiment induced us to follow him as the best of guides, a\r\nChingachgook, a Renard-Subtil. And why not? Was not he the\r\nfellow-countryman of Fenimore Cooper\'s heroes?\r\n\r\nBut, I must repeat that we had not before our eyes that fabulous\r\nland which Arthur Pym described. The soil we were treading had been\r\nravaged, wrecked, torn by convulsion. It was black, a cindery black,\r\nas though it had been vomited from the earth under the action of\r\nPlutonian forces; it suggested that some appalling and irresistible\r\ncataclysm had overturned the whole of its surface.\r\n\r\nNot one of the animals mentioned in the narrative was to be seen,\r\nand even the penguins which abound in the Antarctic regions had fled\r\nfrom this uninhabitable land. Its stern silence and solitude made it\r\na hideous desert. No human being was to be seen either on the coast\r\nor in the interior. Did any chance of finding William Guy and the\r\nsurvivors of the _Jane_ exist in the midst of this scene of desolation?\r\n\r\nI looked at Captain Len Guy. His pale face, dim eyes, and knit brow\r\ntold too plainly that hope was beginning to die within his breast.\r\n\r\nAnd then the population of Tsalal Island, the almost naked men,\r\narmed with clubs and lances, the tall, well-made, upstanding women,\r\nendowed with grace and freedom of bearing not to be found in a\r\ncivilized society--those are the expressions of Arthur Pym--and\r\nthe crowd of children accompanying them, what had become of all\r\nthese? Where were the multitude of natives, with black skins, black\r\nhair, black teeth, who regarded white colour with deadly terror?\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden a light flashed upon me. "An earthquake!" I\r\nexclaimed. "Yes, two or three of those terrible shocks, so common\r\nin these regions where the sea penetrates by infiltration, and a day\r\ncomes when the quantity of accumulated vapour makes its way out and\r\ndestroys everything on the surface."\r\n\r\n"Could an earthquake have changed Tsalal Island to such an\r\nextent?" asked Len Guy, musingly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, captain, an earthquake has done this thing; it has destroyed\r\nevery trace of all that Arthur Pym saw here."\r\n\r\nHunt, who had drawn nigh to us, and was listening, nodded his head\r\nin approval of my words.\r\n\r\n"Are not these countries of the southern seas volcanic?" I\r\nresumed. "If the _Halbrane_ were to transport us to Victoria Land,\r\nwe might find the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_ in the midst of an\r\neruption."\r\n\r\n"And yet," observed Martin Holt, "if there had been an\r\neruption here, we should find lava beds."\r\n\r\n"I do not say that there has been an eruption," I replied,\r\n"but I do say the soil has been convulsed by an earthquake."\r\n\r\nOn reflection it will be seen that the explanation given by me\r\ndeserved to be admitted. And then it came to my remembrance that\r\naccording to Arthur Pym\'s narrative, Tsalal belonged to a group of\r\nislands which extended towards the west. Unless the people of Tsalal\r\nhad been destroyed, it was possible that they might have fled into\r\none of the neighbouring islands. We should do well, then, to go and\r\nreconnoitre that archipelago, for Tsalal clearly had no resources\r\nwhatever to offer after the cataclysm.\r\n\r\nI spoke of this to the captain.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied, and tears stood in his eyes, "yes, it may\r\nbe so. And yet, how could my brother and his unfortunate companions\r\nhave found the means of escaping? Is it not far more probable that\r\nthey all perished in the earthquake?"\r\n\r\nHere Hunt made us a signal to follow him, and we did so.\r\n\r\nAfter he had pushed across the valley for a considerable distance,\r\nhe stopped.\r\n\r\nWhat a spectacle was before our eyes!\r\n\r\nThere, lying in heaps, were human bones, all the fragments of that\r\nframework of humanity which we call the skeleton, hundreds of them,\r\nwithout a particle of flesh, clusters of skulls still bearing some\r\ntufts of hair--a vast bone heap, dried and whitened in this place!\r\nWe were struck dumb and motionless by this spectacle. When Captain\r\nLen Guy could speak, he murmured,--\r\n\r\n"My brother, my poor brother!"\r\n\r\nOn a little reflection, however, my mind refused to admit certain\r\nthings. How was this catastrophe to be reconciled with Patterson\'s\r\nmemoranda? The entries in his note-book stated explicitly that the\r\nmate of the _Jane_ had left his companions on Tsalal Island seven\r\nmonths previously. They could not then have perished in this\r\nearthquake, for the state of the bones proved that it had taken\r\nplace several years earlier, and must have occurred after the\r\ndeparture of Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters, since no mention of it was\r\nmade in the narrative of the former.\r\n\r\nThese facts were, then, irreconcilable. If the earthquake was of\r\nrecent date, the presence of those time-bleached skeletons could not\r\nbe attributed to its action. In any case, the survivors of the _Jane_\r\nwere not among them. But then, where were they?\r\n\r\nThe valley of Klock-Klock extended no farther; we had to retrace our\r\nsteps in order to regain the coast.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly gone half a mile on the cliff\'s edge when Hunt again\r\nstopped, on perceiving some fragments of bones which were turning to\r\ndust, and did not seem to be those of a human being.\r\n\r\nWere these the remains of one of the strange animals described by\r\nArthur Pym, of which we had not hitherto seen any specimens?\r\n\r\nHunt suddenly uttered a cry, or rather a sort of savage growl, and\r\nheld out his enormous hand, holding a metal collar. Yes! a brass\r\ncollar, a collar eaten by rust, but bearing letters which might\r\nstill be deciphered. These letters formed the three following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n"_Tiger_--Arthur Pym."\r\n\r\nTiger!--the name of the dog which had saved Arthur Pym\'s life in\r\nthe hold of the _Grampus_, and, during the revolt of the crew, had\r\nsprung at the throat of Jones, the sailor, who was immediately\r\n"finished" by Dirk Peters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hunt extended his enormous hand, holding a metal\r\ncollar.]\r\n\r\nSo, then, that faithful animal had not perished in the shipwreck of\r\nthe _Grampus_. He had been taken on board the _Jane_ at the same time\r\nas Arthur Pym and the half-breed. And yet the narrative did not allude\r\nto this, and after the meeting with the schooner there was no longer\r\nany mention of the dog. All these contradictions occurred to me. I\r\ncould not reconcile the facts. Nevertheless, there could be no doubt\r\nthat Tiger had been saved from the shipwreck like Arthur Pym, had\r\nescaped the landslip of the Klock-Klock hill, and had come to his\r\ndeath at last in the catastrophe which had destroyed a portion of\r\nthe population of Tsalal.\r\n\r\nBut, again, William Guy and his five sailors could not be among\r\nthose skeletons which were strewn upon the earth, since they were\r\nliving at the time of Patterson\'s departure, seven months ago, and\r\nthe catastrophe already dated several years back!\r\n\r\nThree hours later we had returned on board the _Halbrane_, without\r\nhaving made any other discovery. Captain Len Guy went direct to his\r\ncabin, shut himself up there, and did not reappear even at dinner\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe following day, as I wished to return to the island in order to\r\nresume its exploration from one coast to the other, I requested West\r\nto have me rowed ashore.\r\n\r\nHe consented, after he had been authorized by Captain Len Guy, who\r\ndid not come with us.\r\n\r\nHunt, the boatswain, Martin Holt, four men, and myself took our\r\nplaces in the boat, without arms; for there was no longer anything\r\nto fear.\r\n\r\nWe disembarked at our yesterday\'s landing-place, and Hunt again\r\nled the way towards the hill of Klock-Klock. Nothing remained of the\r\neminence that had been carried away in the artificial landslip, from\r\nwhich the captain of the _Jane_, Patterson, his second officer, and\r\nfive of his men had happily escaped. The village of Klock-Klock had\r\nthus disappeared; and doubtless the mystery of the strange\r\ndiscoveries narrated in Edgar Poe\'s work was now and ever would\r\nremain beyond solution.\r\n\r\nWe had only to regain our ship, returning by the east side of the\r\ncoast. Hunt brought us through the space where sheds had been\r\nerected for the preparation of the _b\xc3\xaache-de mer_, and we saw the\r\nremains of them. On all sides silence and abandonment reigned.\r\n\r\nWe made a brief pause at the place where Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters\r\nseized upon the boat which bore them towards higher latitudes, even\r\nto that horizon of dark vapour whose rents permitted them to discern\r\nthe huge human figure, the white giant.\r\n\r\nHunt stood with crossed arms, his eyes devouring the vast extent of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n"Well, Hunt?" said I, tentatively.\r\n\r\nHunt did not appear to hear me; he did not turn his head in my\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n"What are we doing here?" I asked him, and touched him on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nHe started, and cast a glance upon me which went to my heart.\r\n\r\n"Come along, Hunt," cried Hurliguerly. "Are you going to take\r\nroot on this rock? Don\'t you see the _Halbrane_ waiting for us at\r\nher moorings? Come along. We shall be off to-morrow. There is\r\nnothing more to do here."\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that Hunt\'s trembling lips repeated the word\r\n"nothing," while his whole bearing protested against what the\r\nboatswain said.\r\n\r\nThe boat brought us back to the ship. Captain Len Guy had not left\r\nhis cabin. West, having received no orders, was pacing the deck aft.\r\nI seated myself at the foot of the mainmast, observing the sea which\r\nlay open and free before us.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the captain came on deck; he was very pale, and his\r\nfeatures looked pinched and weary.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling," said he, "I can affirm conscientiously that I\r\nhave done all it was possible to do. Can I hope henceforth that my\r\nbrother William and his companions-- No! No! We must go\r\naway--before winter--"\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up, and cast a last glance towards Tsalal Island.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, Jim," he said to West, "to-morrow we will make\r\nsail as early as possible."\r\n\r\nAt this moment a rough voice uttered the words:\r\n\r\n"And Pym--poor Pym!"\r\n\r\nI recognized this voice.\r\n\r\nIt was the voice I had heard in my dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nAND PYM?\r\n\r\n\r\n"And Pym--poor Pym?"\r\n\r\nI turned round quickly.\r\n\r\nHunt had spoken. This strange person was standing motionless at a\r\nlittle distance, gazing fixedly at the horizon.\r\n\r\nIt was so unusual to hear Hunt\'s voice on board the schooner, that\r\nthe men, whom the unaccustomed sound reached, drew near, moved by\r\ncuriosity. Did not his unexpected intervention point to--I had a\r\npresentiment that it did--some wonderful revelation?\r\n\r\nA movement of West\'s hand sent the men forward, leaving only the\r\nmate, the boatswain, Martin Holt, the sailing-master, and Hardy,\r\nwith the captain and myself in the vicinity of Hunt. The captain\r\napproached and addressed him:\r\n\r\n"What did you say?"\r\n\r\n"I said, \xe2\x80\x98And Pym--poor Pym.\'"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, what do you mean by repeating the name of the man\r\nwhose pernicious advice led my brother to the island on which the\r\n_Jane_ was lost, the greater part of her crew was massacred, and where\r\nwe have not found even one left of those who were still here seven\r\nmonths ago?"\r\n\r\nHunt did not speak.\r\n\r\n"Answer, I say--answer!" cried the captain.\r\n\r\nHunt hesitated, not because he did not know what to say, but from a\r\ncertain difficulty in expressing his ideas. The latter were quite\r\nclear, but his speech was confused, his words were unconnected. He\r\nhad a certain language of his own which sometimes was picturesque,\r\nand his pronunciation was strongly marked by the hoarse accent of\r\nthe Indians of the Far West.\r\n\r\n"You see," he said, "I do not know how to tell things. My\r\ntongue stops. Understand me, I spoke of Pym, poor Pym, did I not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered West, sternly; "and what have you to say about\r\nArthur Pym?"\r\n\r\n"I have to say that he must not be abandoned."\r\n\r\n"Abandoned!" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"No, never! It would be cruel--too cruel. We must go to seek\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"To seek him?" repeated Captain Len Guy.\r\n\r\n"Understand me; it is for this that I have embarked on the\r\n_Halbrane_--yes, to find poor Pym!"\r\n\r\n"And where is he," I asked, "if not deep in a grave, in the\r\ncemetery of his natal city?"\r\n\r\n"No, he is in the place where he remained, alone, all alone,"\r\ncontinued Hunt, pointing towards the south; "and since then the\r\nsun has risen on that horizon seven times."\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Hunt intended to designate the Antarctic\r\nregions, but what did he mean by this?\r\n\r\n"Do you not know that Arthur Pym is dead?" said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Dead!" replied Hunt, emphasizing the word with an expressive\r\ngesture. "No! listen to me: I know things; understand me, he is\r\nnot dead."\r\n\r\n"Come now, Hunt," said I, "remember what you do know. In the\r\nlast chapter of the adventures of Arthur Pym, does not Edgar Poe\r\nrelate his sudden and deplorable end?"\r\n\r\n"Explain yourself, Hunt," said the captain, in a tone of\r\ncommand. "Reflect, take your time, and say plainly whatever you\r\nhave to say."\r\n\r\nAnd, while Hunt passed his hand over his brow, as though to collect\r\nhis memory of far-off things, I observed to Captain Len Guy,--\r\n\r\n"There is something very singular in the intervention of this man,\r\nif indeed he be not mad."\r\n\r\nAt my words the boatswain shook his head, for he did not believe\r\nHunt to be in his right mind.\r\n\r\nThe latter understood this shake of the boatswain\'s head, and\r\ncried out in a harsh tone,--\r\n\r\n"No, not mad. And madmen are respected on the prairies, even if\r\nthey are not believed. And I--I must be believed. No, no, no! Pym\r\nis not dead!"\r\n\r\n"Edgar Poe asserts that he is," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know, Edgar Poe of Baltimore. But--he never saw poor Pym,\r\nnever, never."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Captain Len Guy; "the two men were not\r\nacquainted?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"And it was not Arthur Pym himself who related his adventures to\r\nEdgar Poe?"\r\n\r\n"No, captain, no! He, below there, at Baltimore, had only the\r\nnotes written by Pym from the day when he hid himself on board the\r\n_Grampus_ to the very last hour--the last--understand me the last."\r\n\r\n"Who, then, brought back that journal?" asked Captain Len Guy,\r\nas he seized Hunt\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"It was Pym\'s companion, he who loved him, his poor Pym, like a\r\nson. It was Dirk Peters, the half-breed, who came back alone from\r\nthere--beyond."\r\n\r\n"The half-breed, Dirk Peters!" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Alone?"\r\n\r\n"Alone."\r\n\r\n"And Arthur Pym may be--"\r\n\r\n"There," answered Hunt, in a loud voice, bending towards the\r\nsouthern line, from which he had not diverted his gaze for a moment.\r\n\r\nCould such an assertion prevail against the general incredulity? No,\r\nassuredly not! Martin Holt nudged Hurliguerly with his elbow, and\r\nboth regarded Hunt with pity, while West observed him without\r\nspeaking. Captain Len Guy made me a sign, meaning that nothing\r\nserious was to be got out of this poor fellow, whose mental\r\nfaculties must have been out of gear for a long time.\r\n\r\nAnd nevertheless, when I looked keenly at Hunt, it seemed to me that\r\na sort of radiance of truth shone out of his eyes.\r\n\r\nThen I set to work to interrogate the man, putting to him precise\r\nand pressing questions which he tried to answer categorically, as we\r\nshall see, and not once did he contradict himself.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," I asked, "did Arthur Pym really come to Tsalal\r\nIsland on board the _Grampus_?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did Arthur Pym separate himself, with the half-breed and one of\r\nthe sailors, from his companions while Captain William Guy had gone\r\nto the village of Klock-Klock?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. The sailor was one Allen, and he was almost immediately\r\nstifled under the stones."\r\n\r\n"Then the two others saw the attack, and the destruction of the\r\nschooner, from the top of the hill?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then, some time later, the two left the island, after they had\r\ngot possession of one of the boats which the natives could not take\r\nfrom them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And, after twenty days, having reached the front of the curtain\r\nof vapour, they were both carried down into the gulf of the\r\ncataract?"\r\n\r\nThis time Hunt did not reply in the affirmative; he hesitated, he\r\nstammered out some vague words; he seemed to be trying to rekindle\r\nthe half-extinguished flame of his memory. At length, looking at me\r\nand shaking his head, he answered,--\r\n\r\n"No, not both. Understand me--Dirk never told me--"\r\n\r\n"Dirk Peters," interposed Captain Len Guy, quickly. "You knew\r\nDirk Peters?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"At Vandalia, State of Illinois."\r\n\r\n"And it is from him that you have all this information concerning\r\nthe voyage?"\r\n\r\n"From him."\r\n\r\n"And he came back alone--alone--from that voyage, having left\r\nArthur Pym."\r\n\r\n"Alone!"\r\n\r\n"Speak, man--do speak!" I cried, impatiently. Then, in broken,\r\nbut intelligible sentences, Hunt spoke,--\r\n\r\n"Yes--there--a curtain of vapour--so the half-breed often\r\nsaid--understand me. The two, Arthur Pym and he, were in the Tsalal\r\nboat. Then an enormous block of ice came full upon them. At the\r\nshock Dirk Peters was thrown into the sea, but he clung to the ice\r\nblock, and--understand me, he saw the boat drift with the current,\r\nfar, very far, too far! In vain did Pym try to rejoin his companion,\r\nhe could not; the boat drifted on and on, and Pym, that poor dear\r\nPym, was carried away. It is he who has never come back, and he is\r\nthere, still there!"\r\n\r\nIf Hunt had been the half-breed in person he could not have spoken\r\nwith more heartfelt emotion of "poor Pym."\r\n\r\nIt was then, in front of the "curtain of vapour," that Arthur\r\nPym and the half-breed had been separated from each other. Dirk\r\nPeters had succeeded in returning from the ice-world to America,\r\nwhither he had conveyed the notes that were communicated to Edgar\r\nPoe.\r\n\r\nHunt was minutely questioned upon all these points and he replied,\r\nconformably, he declared, to what the half-breed had told him many\r\ntimes. According to this statement, Dirk Peters had Arthur Pym\'s\r\nnote-book in his pocket at the moment when the ice-block struck\r\nthem, and thus the journal which the half-breed placed at the\r\ndisposal of the American romance-writer was saved.\r\n\r\n"Understand me," Hunt repeated, "for I tell you things as I\r\nhave them from Dirk Peters. While the drift was carrying him away,\r\nhe cried out with all his strength. Pym, poor Pym, had already\r\ndisappeared in the midst of the vapour. The half-breed, feeding upon\r\nraw fish, which he contrived to catch, was carried back by a cross\r\ncurrent to Tsalal Island, where he landed half dead from hunger."\r\n\r\n"To Tsalal Island!" exclaimed Captain Len Guy. "And how long\r\nwas it since they had left it?"\r\n\r\n"Three weeks--yes, three weeks at the farthest, so Dirk Peters\r\ntold me."\r\n\r\n"Then he must have found all that remained of the crew of the\r\n_Jane_--my brother William and those who had survived with him?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Hunt; "and Dirk Peters always believed that they\r\nhad perished--yes, to the very last man. There was no one upon the\r\nisland."\r\n\r\n"No one?"\r\n\r\n"Not a living soul."\r\n\r\n"But the population?"\r\n\r\n"No one! No one, I tell you. The island was a desert--yes, a desert!"\r\n\r\nThis statement contradicted certain facts of which we were\r\nabsolutely certain. After all, though, it was possible that when Dirk\r\nPeters returned to Tsalal Island, the population, seized by who can\r\ntell what terror, had already taken refuge upon the south-western\r\ngroup, and that William Guy and his companions were still hidden in the\r\ngorges of Klock-Klock. That would explain why the half-breed had not\r\ncome across them, and also why the survivors of the _Jane_ had had\r\nnothing to fear during the eleven years of their sojourn in the island.\r\nOn the other hand, since Patterson had left them there seven months\r\npreviously, if we did not find them, that must have been because they\r\nhad been obliged to leave Tsalal, the place being rendered\r\nuninhabitable by the earthquake.\r\n\r\n"So that," resumed Captain Len Guy, "on the return of Dirk Peters,\r\nthere was no longer an inhabitant on the island?"\r\n\r\n"No one," repeated Hunt, "no one. The half-breed did not meet a single\r\nnative."\r\n\r\n"And what did Dirk Peters do?"\r\n\r\n"Understand me. A forsaken boat lay there, at the back of the bay,\r\ncontaining some dried meat and several casks of water. The\r\nhalf-breed got into it, and a south wind--yes, south, very strong,\r\nthe same that had driven the ice block, with the cross current,\r\ntowards Tsalal Island--carried him on for weeks and weeks--to the\r\niceberg barrier, through a passage in it--you may believe me, I am\r\ntelling you only what Dirk Peters told me--and he cleared the polar\r\ncircle."\r\n\r\n"And beyond it?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Beyond it. He was picked up by an American whaler, the _Sandy\r\nHook_, and taken back to America."\r\n\r\nNow, one thing at all events was clear. Edgar Poe had never known\r\nArthur Pym. This was the reason why, wishing to leave his readers in\r\nexciting uncertainty, he had brought Pym to an end "as sudden as\r\nit was deplorable," but without indicating the manner or the cause of\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\n"And yet, although Arthur Pym did not return, could it be\r\nreasonably admitted that he had survived his companion for any\r\nlength of time, that he was still living, eleven years having\r\nelapsed since his disappearance?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," replied Hunt.\r\n\r\nAnd this he affirmed with the strong conviction that Dirk Peters had\r\ninfused into his mind while the two were living together in\r\nVandalia, in Illinois.\r\n\r\nNow the question arose, was Hunt sane? Was it not he who had stolen\r\ninto my cabin in a fit of insanity--of this I had no doubt--and\r\nmurmured in my ear the words: "And Pym--poor Pym"?\r\n\r\nYes, and I had not been dreaming! In short, if all that Hunt had\r\njust said was true, if he was but the faithful reporter of secrets\r\nwhich had been entrusted to him by Dirk Peters, ought he to be\r\nbelieved when he repeated in a tone of mingled command and\r\nentreaty,--\r\n\r\n"Pym is not dead. Pym is there. Poor Pym must not be forsaken!"\r\n\r\nWhen I had made an end of questioning Hunt, Captain Len Guy came out\r\nof his meditative mood, profoundly troubled, and gave the word,\r\n"All hands forward!"\r\n\r\nWhen the men were assembled around him, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, Hunt, and seriously consider the gravity of the\r\nquestions I am about to put to you."\r\n\r\nHunt held his head up, and ran his eyes over the crew of the\r\n_Halbrane_.\r\n\r\n"You assert, Hunt, that all you have told us concerning Arthur Pym is\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You knew Dirk Peters?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You lived some years with him in Illinois?"\r\n\r\n"Nine years."\r\n\r\n"And he often related these things to you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And, for your own part, you have no doubt that he told you the\r\nexact truth?"\r\n\r\n"None."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, did it never occur to him that some of the crew of\r\nthe _Jane_ might have remained on Tsalal Island?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"He believed that William Guy and his companions must all have\r\nperished in the landslip of the hill of Klock-Klock?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and from what he often repeated to me, Pym believed it also."\r\n\r\n"Where did you see Dirk Peters for the last time?"\r\n\r\n"At Vandalia."\r\n\r\n"How long ago?"\r\n\r\n"Over two years."\r\n\r\n"And which of you two was the first to leave Vandalia?"\r\n\r\nI thought I detected a slight hesitation in Hunt before he\r\nanswered,--\r\n\r\n"We left the place together."\r\n\r\n"You, to go to?"\r\n\r\n"The Falklands."\r\n\r\n"And he?"\r\n\r\n"He?" repeated Hunt.\r\n\r\nAnd then his wandering gaze fixed itself on Martin Holt, our\r\nsailing-master, whose life he had saved at the risk of his own\r\nduring the tempest.\r\n\r\n"Well!" resumed the captain, "do you not understand what I am\r\nasking you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then answer me. When Dirk Peters left Illinois, did he finally\r\ngive up America?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"To go whither? Speak!"\r\n\r\n"To the Falklands."\r\n\r\n"And where is he now?"\r\n\r\n"He stands before you."\r\n\r\nDirk Peters! Hunt was the half-breed Dirk Peters, the devoted\r\ncompanion of Arthur Pym, he whom Captain Guy had so long sought for\r\nin the United States, and whose presence was probably to furnish us\r\nwith a fresh reason for pursuing our daring campaign.\r\n\r\nI shall not be at all surprised if my readers have already\r\nrecognized Dirk Peters in Hunt; indeed, I shall be astonished if\r\nthey have failed to do so. The extraordinary thing is that Captain\r\nLen Guy and myself, who had read Edgar Poe\'s book over and over\r\nagain, did not see at once, when Hunt came on the ship at the\r\nFalklands, that he and the half-breed were identical! I can only\r\nadmit that we were both blindfolded by some hidden action of Fate,\r\njust when certain pages of that book ought to have effectually\r\ncleared our vision.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt whatever that Hunt really was Dirk Peters.\r\nAlthough he was eleven years older, he answered in every particular\r\nto the description of him given by Arthur Pym, except that he was no\r\nlonger "of fierce aspect." In fact, the half-breed had changed\r\nwith age and the experience of terrible scenes through which he had\r\npassed; nevertheless, he was still the faithful companion to whom\r\nArthur Pym had often owed his safety, that same Dirk Peters who\r\nloved him as his own son, and who had never--no, never--lost the\r\nhope of finding him again one day amid the awful Antarctic wastes.\r\n\r\nNow, why had Dirk Peters hidden himself in the Falklands under the\r\nname of Hunt? Why, since his embarkation on the _Halbrane_, had he\r\nkept up that _incognito_? Why had he not told who he was, since he was\r\naware of the intentions of the captain, who was about to make every\r\neffort to save his countrymen by following the course of the _Jane_?\r\n\r\nWhy? No doubt because he feared that his name would inspire horror.\r\nWas it not the name of one who had shared in the horrible scenes of\r\nthe _Grampus_, who had killed Parker, the sailor, who had fed upon the\r\nman\'s flesh, and quenched his thirst in the man\'s blood? To\r\ninduce him to reveal his name he must needs be assured that the\r\n_Halbrane_ would attempt to discover and rescue Arthur Pym!\r\n\r\nAnd as to the existence of Arthur Pym? I confess that my reason did\r\nnot rebel against the admission of it as a possibility. The\r\nimploring cry of the half-breed, "Pym, poor Pym! he must not be\r\nforsaken!" troubled me profoundly.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, since I had resolved to take part in the expedition of\r\nthe _Halbrane_, I was no longer the same man!\r\n\r\nA long silence had followed the astounding declaration of the\r\nhalf-breed. None dreamed of doubting his veracity. He had said, "I\r\nam Dirk Peters." He was Dirk Peters.\r\n\r\nAt length, moved by irresistible impulse, I said:\r\n\r\n"My friends, before any decision is made, let us carefully\r\nconsider the situation. Should we not lay up everlasting regret for\r\nourselves if we were to abandon our expedition at the very moment\r\nwhen it promises to succeed? Reflect upon this, captain, and you,\r\nmy companions. It is less than seven months since Patterson left\r\nyour countrymen alive on Tsalal Island. If they were there then, the\r\nfact proves that for eleven years they had been enabled to exist on\r\nthe resources provided by the island, having nothing to fear from\r\nthe islanders, some of whom had fallen victims to circumstances\r\nunknown to us, and others had probably transferred themselves to\r\nsome neighbouring island. This is quite plain, and I do not see how\r\nany objection can be raised to my reasoning."\r\n\r\nNo one made answer: there was none to be made.\r\n\r\n"If we have not come across the captain of the _Jane_ and his\r\npeople," I resumed, "it is because they have been obliged to\r\nabandon Tsalal Island since Patterson\'s departure. Why? In my\r\nbelief, it was because the earthquake had rendered the island\r\nuninhabitable. Now, they would only have required a native boat to\r\ngain either another island or some point of the Antarctic continent\r\nby the aid of the southern current. I hardly hesitate to assert that\r\nall this has occurred; but in any case, I know, and I repeat, that\r\nwe shall have done nothing if we do not persevere in the search on\r\nwhich the safety of your countrymen depends."\r\n\r\nI questioned my audience by a searching look. No answer.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy, whose emotion was unrestrained, bowed his head, for\r\nhe felt that I was right, that by invoking the duties of humanity I\r\nwas prescribing the only course open to men with feeling hearts.\r\n\r\n"And what is in question?" I continued, after the silent pause.\r\n"To accomplish a few degrees of latitude, and that while the sea\r\nis open, while we have two months of good weather to look for, and\r\nnothing to fear from the southern winter. I certainly should not ask\r\nyou to brave its severity. And shall we hesitate, when the _Halbrane_\r\nis abundantly furnished, her crew complete and in good health? Shall\r\nwe take fright at imaginary dangers? Shall we not have courage to go\r\non, on, thither?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dirk Peters shows the way.]\r\n\r\nAnd I pointed to the southern horizon. Dirk Peters pointed to it\r\nalso, with an imperative gesture which spoke for him.\r\n\r\nStill, the eyes of all were fixed upon us, but there was no\r\nresponse. I continued to urge every argument, and to quote every\r\nexample in favour of the safety of pursuing our voyage, but the\r\nsilence was unbroken, and now the men stood with eyes cast down.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I had not once pronounced the name of Dirk Peters, nor\r\nalluded to Dirk Peters\' proposal.\r\n\r\nI was asking myself whether I had or had not succeeded in inspiring\r\nmy companions with my own belief, when Captain Len Guy spoke:\r\n\r\n"Dirk Peters," he said, "do you assert that Arthur Pym and you\r\nafter your departure from Tsalal Island saw land in the direction of\r\nthe south?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, land," answered the half-breed. "Islands or\r\ncontinent--understand me--and I believe that Pym, poor Pym, is\r\nwaiting there until aid comes to him."\r\n\r\n"There, where perhaps William Guy and his companions are also\r\nwaiting," said I, to bring back the discussion to more practical\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy reflected for a little while, and then spoke:\r\n\r\n"Is it true, Dirk Peters," he asked, "that beyond the\r\neighty-fourth parallel the horizon is shut in by that curtain of\r\nvapour which is described in the narrative? Have you seen--seen\r\nwith your own eyes--those cataracts in the air, that gulf in which\r\nArthur Pym\'s boat was lost?"\r\n\r\nThe half-breed looked from one to the other of us, and shook his big\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he said. "What are you asking me about,\r\ncaptain? A curtain of vapour? Yes, perhaps, and also appearances of\r\nland towards the south."\r\n\r\nEvidently Dirk Peters had never read Edgar Poe\'s book, and very\r\nlikely did not know how to read. After having handed over Pym\'s\r\njournal, he had not troubled himself about its publication. Having\r\nretired to Illinois at first and to the Falklands afterwards, he had\r\nno notion of the stir that the work had made, or of the fantastic\r\nand baseless climax to which our great poet had brought those\r\nstrange adventures.\r\n\r\nAnd, besides, might not Arthur Pym himself, with his tendency to the\r\nsupernatural, have fancied that he saw these wondrous things, due\r\nsolely to his imaginative brain?\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time in the course of this discussion, West\'s\r\nvoice made itself heard. I had no idea which side he would take. The\r\nfirst words he uttered were:\r\n\r\n"Captain, your orders?"\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy turned towards his crew, who surrounded him, both\r\nthe old and the new. Hearne remained in the background, ready to\r\nintervene if he should think it necessary.\r\n\r\nThe captain questioned the boatswain and his comrades, whose\r\ndevotion was unreservedly his, by a long and anxious look, and I\r\nheard him mutter between his teeth,--\r\n\r\n"Ah! if it depended only on me! if I were sure of the assent and\r\nthe help of them all!"\r\n\r\nThen Hearne spoke roughly:\r\n\r\n"Captain," said he, "it\'s two months since we left the\r\nFalklands. Now, my companions were engaged for a voyage which was\r\nnot to take them farther beyond the icebergs than Tsalal Island."\r\n\r\n"That is not so," exclaimed Captain Len Guy. "No! That is not\r\nso. I recruited you all for an enterprise which I have a right to\r\npursue, so far as I please."\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon," said Hearne, coolly, "but we have come to a\r\npoint which no navigator has ever yet reached, in a sea, no ship\r\nexcept the _Jane_ has ever ventured into before us, and therefore my\r\ncomrades and I mean to return to the Falklands before the bad\r\nseason. From there _you_ can return to Tsalal Island, and even go on\r\nto the Pole, if you so please."\r\n\r\nA murmur of approbation greeted his words; no doubt the\r\nsealing-master justly interpreted the sentiments of the majority,\r\ncomposed of the new recruits. To go against their opinion, to exact\r\nthe obedience of these ill-disposed men, and under such conditions\r\nto risk the unknown Antarctic waters, would have been an act of\r\ntemerity--or, rather, an act of madness--that would have brought\r\nabout some catastrophe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, West, advancing upon Hearne, said to him in a\r\nthreatening tone, "Who gave you leave to speak?"\r\n\r\n"The captain questioned us," replied Hearne. "I had a right to\r\nreply."\r\n\r\nThe man uttered these words with such insolence that West, who was\r\ngenerally so self-restrained, was about to give free vent to his\r\nwrath, when Captain Len Guy, stopping him by a motion of his hand,\r\nsaid quietly,--\r\n\r\n"Be calm, Jem. Nothing can be done unless we are all agreed. What\r\nis your opinion, Hurliguerly?"\r\n\r\n"It is very clear, captain," replied the boatswain. "I will\r\nobey your orders, whatever they may be! It is our duty not to\r\nforsake William Guy and the others so long as any chance of saving\r\nthem remains."\r\n\r\nThe boatswain paused for a moment, while several of the sailors gave\r\nunequivocal signs of approbation.\r\n\r\n"As for what concerns Arthur Pym--"\r\n\r\n"There is no question of Arthur Pym," struck in the captain,\r\n"but only of my brother William and his companions."\r\n\r\nI saw at this moment that Dirk Peters was about to protest, and\r\ncaught hold of his arm. He shook with anger, but kept silence.\r\n\r\nThe captain continued his questioning of the men, desiring to know\r\nby name all those upon whom he might reckon. The old crew to a man\r\nacquiesced in his proposals, and pledged themselves to obey his\r\norders implicitly and follow him whithersoever he chose to go.\r\n\r\nThree only of the recruits joined those faithful seamen; these were\r\nEnglish sailors. The others were of Hearne\'s opinion, holding that\r\nfor them the campaign was ended at Tsalal Island. They therefore\r\nrefused to go beyond that point, and formally demanded that the ship\r\nshould be steered northward so as to clear the icebergs at the most\r\nfavourable period of the season.\r\n\r\nTwenty men were on their side, and to constrain them to lend a hand\r\nto the working of the ship if she were to be diverted to the south\r\nwould have been to provoke them to rebel. There was but one\r\nresource: to arouse their covetousness, to strike the chord of\r\nself-interest.\r\n\r\nI intervened, therefore, and addressed them in a tone which\r\nplaced the seriousness of my proposal beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\n"Men of the _Halbrane_, listen to me! Just as various States have\r\ndone for voyages of discovery in the Polar Regions, I offer a reward\r\nto the crew of this schooner. Two thousand dollars shall be shared\r\namong you for every degree we make beyond the eighty-fourth\r\nparallel."\r\n\r\nNearly seventy dollars to each man; this was a strong temptation.\r\n\r\nI felt that I had hit the mark.\r\n\r\n"I will sign an agreement to that effect," I continued, "with\r\nCaptain Len Guy as your representative, and the sums gained shall be\r\nhanded to you on your return, no matter under what conditions that\r\nreturn be accomplished."\r\n\r\nI waited for the effect of this promise, and, to tell the truth, I\r\nhad not to wait long.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" cried the boatswain, acting as fugleman to his\r\ncomrades, who almost unanimously added their cheers to his. Hearne\r\noffered no farther opposition; it would always be in his power to\r\nput in his word when the circumstances should be more propitious.\r\n\r\nThus the bargain was made, and, to gain my ends, I have made a\r\nheavier sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt is true we were within seven degrees of the South Pole, and, if\r\nthe _Halbrane_ should indeed reach that spot, it would never cost\r\nme more than fourteen thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 27th of December the _Halbrane_ put out to\r\nsea, heading south-west.\r\n\r\nAfter the scene of the preceding evening Captain Len Guy had taken a\r\nfew hours\' rest. I met him next day on deck while West was going\r\nabout fore and aft, and he called us both to him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling," he said, "it was with a terrible pang that I\r\ncame to the resolution to bring our schooner back to the north! I\r\nfelt I had not done all I ought to do for our unhappy\r\nfellow-countrymen: but I knew that the majority of the crew would be\r\nagainst me if I insisted on going beyond Tsalal Island."\r\n\r\n"That is true, captain; there was a beginning of indiscipline on\r\nboard, and perhaps it might have ended in a revolt."\r\n\r\n"A revolt we should have speedily put down," said West, coolly,\r\n"were it only by knocking Hearne, who is always exciting the\r\nmutinous men, on the head."\r\n\r\n"And you would have done well, Jem," said the captain. "Only,\r\njustice being satisfied, what would have become of the agreement\r\ntogether, which we must have in order to do anything?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, captain, it is better that things passed off without\r\nviolence! But for the future Hearne will have to look out for\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"His companions," observed the captain, "are now greedy for\r\nthe prizes that have been promised them. The greed of gain will make\r\nthem more willing and persevering. The generosity of Mr. Jeorling\r\nhas succeeded where our entreaties would undoubtedly have failed. I\r\nthank him for it."\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy held out a hand to me, which I grasped cordially.\r\n\r\nAfter some general conversation relating to our purpose, the\r\nship\'s course, and the proposed verification of the bearings of\r\nthe group of islands on the west of Tsalal which is described by\r\nArthur Pym, the captain said,--\r\n\r\n"As it is possible that the ravages of the earthquake did not\r\nextend to this group, and that it may still be inhabited, we must be\r\non our guard in approaching the bearings."\r\n\r\n"Which cannot be very far off," I added. "And then, captain,\r\nwho knows but that your brother and his sailors might have taken\r\nrefuge on one of these islands!"\r\n\r\nThis was admissible, but not a consoling eventuality, for in that\r\ncase the poor fellows would have fallen into the hands of those\r\nsavages of whom they were rid while they remained at Tsalal.\r\n\r\n"Jem," resumed Captain Len Guy, "we are making good way, and\r\nno doubt land will be signalled in a few hours. Give orders for the\r\nwatch to be careful."\r\n\r\n"It\'s done, captain."\r\n\r\n"There is a man in the crow\'s-nest?"\r\n\r\n"Dirk Peters himself, at his own request."\r\n\r\n"All right, Jem; we may trust his vigilance."\r\n\r\n"And also his eyes," I added, "for he is gifted with amazing\r\nsight."\r\n\r\nFor two hours of very quick sailing not the smallest indication of\r\nthe group of eight islands was visible.\r\n\r\n"It is incomprehensible that we have not come in sight of them,"\r\nsaid the captain. "I reckon that the _Halbrane_ has made sixty miles\r\nsince this morning, and the islands in question are tolerably close\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"Then, captain, we must conclude--and it is not unlikely--that\r\nthe group to which Tsalal belonged has entirely disappeared in the\r\nearthquake."\r\n\r\n"Land ahead!" cried Dirk Peters.\r\n\r\nWe looked, but could discern nothing on the sea, nor was it until a\r\nquarter of an hour had elapsed that our glasses enabled us to\r\nrecognize the tops of a few scattered islets shining in the oblique\r\nrays of the sun, two or three miles to the westward.\r\n\r\nWhat a change! How had it come about? Arthur Pym described spacious\r\nislands, but only a small number of tiny islets, half a dozen at\r\nmost, protruded from the waters.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the half-breed came sliding down from his lofty perch\r\nand jumped to the deck.\r\n\r\n"Well, Dirk Peters! Have you recognized the group?" asked the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n"The group?" replied the half-breed, shaking his head. "No, I\r\nhave only seen the tops of five or six islets. There is nothing but\r\nstone heaps there--not a single island!"\r\n\r\nAs the schooner approached we easily recognized these fragments of\r\nthe group, which had been almost entirely destroyed on its western\r\nside. The scattered remains formed dangerous reefs which might\r\nseriously injure the keel or the sides of the _Halbrane_, and there\r\nwas no intention of risking the ship\'s safety among them. We\r\naccordingly cast anchor at a safe distance, and a boat was lowered\r\nfor the reception of Captain Len Guy, the boatswain, Dirk Peters,\r\nHolt, two men and myself. The still, transparent water, as Peters\r\nsteered us skilfully between the projecting edges of the little\r\nreefs, allowed us to see, not a bed of sand strewn with shells, but\r\nblackish heaps which were overgrown by land vegetation, tufts of plants\r\nnot belonging to the marine flora that floated on the surface of the\r\nsea. Presently we landed on one of the larger islets which rose to\r\nabout thirty feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n"Do the tides rise sometimes to that height?" I inquired of the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The half-breed in the crow\'s-nest.]\r\n\r\n"Never," he replied, "and perhaps we shall discover some\r\nremains of the vegetable kingdom, of habitations, or of an\r\nencampment."\r\n\r\n"The best thing we can do," said the boatswain, "is to follow\r\nDirk Peters, who has already distanced us. The half-breed\'s lynx\r\neyes will see what we can\'t."\r\n\r\nPeters had indeed scaled the eminence in a moment, and we presently\r\njoined him on the top.\r\n\r\nThe islet was strewn with remains (probably of those domestic\r\nanimals mentioned in Arthur Pym\'s journal), but these bones\r\ndiffered from the bones on Tsalal Island by the fact that the heaps\r\ndated from a few months only. This then agreed with the recent\r\nperiod at which we placed the earthquake. Besides, plants and tufts\r\nof flowers were growing here and there.\r\n\r\n"And these are this year\'s," I cried, "no southern winter\r\nhas passed over them."\r\n\r\nThese facts having been ascertained, no doubt could remain\r\nrespecting the date of the cataclysm after the departure of\r\nPatterson. The destruction of the population of Tsalal whose bones\r\nlay about the village was not attributable to that catastrophe.\r\nWilliam Guy and the five sailors of the _Jane_ had been able to fly in\r\ntime, since no bones that could be theirs had been found on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nWhere had they taken refuge? This was the ever-pressing question.\r\nWhat answer were we to obtain? Must we conclude that having reached\r\none of these islets they had perished in the swallowing-up of the\r\narchipelago? We debated this point, as may be supposed, at a length\r\nand with detail which I can only indicate here. Suffice it to say\r\nthat a decision was arrived at to the following effect. Our sole\r\nchance of discovering the unfortunate castaways was to continue our\r\nvoyage for two or three parallels farther; the goal was there, and\r\nwhich of us would not sacrifice even his life to attain it?\r\n\r\n"God is guiding us, Mr. Jeorling," said Captain Len Guy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nA REVELATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day, the 29th of December, at six in the morning, the\r\nschooner set sail with a north-east wind, and this time her course\r\nwas due south. The two succeeding days passed wholly without\r\nincident; neither land nor any sign of land was observed. The men on\r\nthe _Halbrane_ took great hauls of fish, to their own satisfaction and\r\nours. It was New Year\'s Day, 1840, four months and seventeen days\r\nsince I had left the Kerguelens and two months and five days since\r\nthe _Halbrane_ had sailed from the Falklands. The half-breed, between\r\nwhom and myself an odd kind of tacit understanding subsisted,\r\napproached the bench on which I was sitting--the captain was in his\r\ncabin, and West was not in sight--with a plain intention of\r\nconversing with me. The subject may easily be guessed.\r\n\r\n"Dirk Peters," said I, taking up the subject at once, "do you\r\nwish that we should talk of _him_?"\r\n\r\n"Him!" he murmured.\r\n\r\n"You have remained faithful to his memory, Dirk Peters."\r\n\r\n"Forget him, sir! Never!"\r\n\r\n"He is always there--before you?"\r\n\r\n"Always! So many dangers shared! That makes brothers! No, it makes\r\na father and his son! Yes! And I have seen America again, but\r\nPym--poor Pym--he is still beyond there!"\r\n\r\n"Dirk Peters," I asked, "have you any idea of the route which\r\nyou and Arthur Pym followed in the boat after your departure from\r\nTsalal Island?"\r\n\r\n"None, sir! Poor Pym had no longer any instrument--you\r\nknow--sea machines--for looking at the sun. We could not know,\r\nexcept that for the eight days the current pushed us towards the\r\nsouth, and the wind also. A fine breeze and a fair sea, and our\r\nshirts for a sail."\r\n\r\n"Yes, white linen shirts, which frightened your prisoner Nu\r\nNu--"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so--I did not notice. But if Pym has said so, Pym must\r\nbe believed."\r\n\r\n"And during those eight days you were able to supply yourselves\r\nwith food?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, and the days after--we and the savage. You know--the\r\nthree turtles that were in the boat. These animals contain a store\r\nof fresh water--and their flesh is sweet, even raw. Oh, raw flesh,\r\nsir!"\r\n\r\nHe lowered his voice, and threw a furtive glance around him. It\r\nwould be impossible to describe the frightful expression of the\r\nhalf-breed\'s face as he thus recalled the terrible scenes of the\r\n_Grampus_. And it was not the expression of a cannibal of Australia or\r\nthe New Hebrides, but that of a man who is pervaded by an\r\ninsurmountable horror of himself.\r\n\r\n"Was it not on the 1st of March, Dirk Peters," I asked, "that\r\nyou perceived for the first time the veil of grey vapour shot with\r\nluminous and moving rays?"\r\n\r\n"I do not remember, sir, but if Pym says it was so, Pym must be\r\nbelieved."\r\n\r\n"Did he never speak to you of fiery rays which fell from the\r\nsky?" I did not use the term "polar aurora," lest the half-breed should\r\nnot understand it.\r\n\r\n"Never, sir," said Dirk Peters, after some reflection.\r\n\r\n"Did you not remark that the colour of the sea changed, grew white\r\nlike milk, and that its surface became ruffled around your boat?"\r\n\r\n"It may have been so, sir; I did not observe. The boat went on and\r\non, and my head went with it."\r\n\r\n"And then, the fine powder, as fine as ashes, that fell--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember it."\r\n\r\n"Was it not snow?"\r\n\r\n"Snow? Yes! No! The weather was warm. What did Pym say? Pym must\r\nbe believed." He lowered his voice and continued: "But Pym will\r\ntell you all that, sir. He knows. I do not know. He saw, and you\r\nwill believe him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Dirk Peters, I shall believe him."\r\n\r\n"We are to go in search of him, are we not?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"After we shall have found William Guy and the sailors of the\r\n_Jane_!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, after."\r\n\r\n"And even if we do not find them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, even in that case. I think I shall induce our captain. I\r\nthink he will not refuse--"\r\n\r\n"No, he will not refuse to bring help to a man--a man like him!"\r\n\r\n"And yet," I said, "if William Guy and his people are living,\r\ncan we admit that Arthur Pym--"\r\n\r\n"Living? Yes! Living!" cried the half-breed. "By the great\r\nspirit of my fathers, he is--he is waiting for me, my poor Pym! How\r\njoyful he will be when he clasps his old Dirk in his arms, and\r\nI--I, when I feel him, there, there."\r\n\r\nAnd the huge chest of the man heaved like a stormy sea. Then he went\r\naway, leaving me inexpressibly affected by the revelation of the\r\ntenderness for his unfortunate companion that lay deep in the heart\r\nof this semi-savage.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I said but little to Captain Len Guy, whose whole\r\nheart and soul were set on the rescue of his brother, of the\r\npossibility of our finding Arthur Gordon Pym. Time enough, if in the\r\ncourse of this strange enterprise of ours we succeeded in that object,\r\nto urge upon him one still more visionary.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 7th of January--according to Dirk Peters, who had\r\nfixed it only by the time that had expired--we arrived at the\r\nplace where Nu Nu the savage breathed his last, lying in the bottom\r\nof the boat. On that day an observation gave 86\xc2\xb0 33\' for the latitude,\r\nthe longitude remaining the same between the forty-second and the\r\nforty-third meridian. Here it was, according to the half-breed, that\r\nthe two fugitives were parted after the collision between the boat\r\nand the floating mass of ice. But a question now arose. Since the\r\nmass of ice carrying away Dirk Peters had drifted towards the north,\r\nwas this because it was subjected to the action of a counter-current?\r\n\r\nYes, that must have been so, for our schooner had not felt the\r\ninfluence of the current which had guided her on leaving the\r\nFalklands, for fully four days. And yet, there was nothing\r\nsurprising in that, for everything is variable in the austral seas.\r\nHappily, the fresh breeze from the north-east continued to blow, and\r\nthe _Halbrane_ made progress toward higher waters, thirteen degrees in\r\nadvance upon Weddell\'s ship and two degrees upon the _Jane_. As for the\r\nland--islands or continent--which Captain Len Guy was seeking on\r\nthe surface of that vast ocean, it did not appear. I was well aware\r\nthat he was gradually losing confidence in our enterprise.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I was possessed by the desire to rescue Arthur Pym as\r\nwell as the survivors of the _Jane_. And yet, how could he have\r\nsurvived! But then, the half-breed\'s fixed idea! Supposing our\r\ncaptain were to give the order to go back, what would Dirk Peters\r\ndo? Throw himself into the sea rather than return northwards? This\r\nit was which made me dread some act of violence on his part, when he\r\nheard the greater number of the sailors protesting against this\r\ninsensate voyage, and talking of putting the ship about, especially\r\ntowards Hearne, who was stealthily inciting his comrades of the\r\nFalklands to insubordination.\r\n\r\nIt was absolutely necessary not to allow discipline to decline, or\r\ndiscouragement to grow among the crew; so that, on the 7th of\r\nJanuary, Captain Len Guy at my request assembled the men and\r\naddressed them in the following words:--\r\n\r\n"Sailors of the _Halbrane_, since our departure from Tsalal Island,\r\nthe schooner has gained two degrees southwards, and I now inform\r\nyou, that, conformably with the engagement signed by Mr. Jeorling,\r\nfour thousand dollars--that is two thousand dollars for each\r\ndegree--are due to you, and will be paid at the end of the\r\nvoyage."\r\n\r\nThese words were greeted with some murmurs of satisfaction, but not\r\nwith cheers, except those of Hurliguerly the boatswain, and Endicott\r\nthe cook, which found no echo.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of January a conversation took place between the\r\nboatswain and myself of a nature to justify my anxiety concerning\r\nthe temper of our crew.\r\n\r\nThe men were at breakfast, with the exception of Drap and Stern. The\r\nschooner was cutting the water under a stiff breeze. I was walking\r\nbetween the fore and main masts, watching the great flights of birds\r\nwheeling about the ship with deafening clangour, and the petrels\r\noccasionally perching on our yards. No effort was made to catch or\r\nshoot them; it would have been useless cruelty, since their oily and\r\nstringy flesh is not eatable.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Hurliguerly approached me, looked attentively at the\r\nbirds, and said,--\r\n\r\n"I remark one thing, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"What is it, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"That these birds do not fly so directly south as they did up to\r\nthe present. Some of them are setting north."\r\n\r\n"I have noticed the same fact."\r\n\r\n"And I add, Mr. Jeorling, that those who are below there will come\r\nback without delay."\r\n\r\n"And you conclude from this?"\r\n\r\n"I conclude that they feel the approach of winter."\r\n\r\n"Of winter?"\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly."\r\n\r\n"No, no, boatswain; the temperature is so high that the birds\r\ncan\'t want to get to less cold regions so prematurely."\r\n\r\n"Oh! prematurely, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"Yes, boatswain; do we not know that navigators have always been\r\nable to frequent the Antarctic waters until the month of March?"\r\n\r\n"Not at such a latitude. Besides, there are precocious winters as\r\nwell as precocious summers. The fine season this year was full two\r\nmonths in advance, and it is to be feared the bad season may come\r\nsooner than usual."\r\n\r\n"That is very likely," I replied. "After all, it does not\r\nsignify to us, since our campaign will certainly be over in three\r\nweeks."\r\n\r\n"If some obstacle does not arise beforehand, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"And what obstacle?"\r\n\r\n"For instance, a continent stretching to the south and barring our\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"A continent, Hurliguerly!"\r\n\r\n"I should not be at all surprised."\r\n\r\n"And, in fact, there would be nothing surprising in it."\r\n\r\n"As for the lands seen by Dirk Peters," said the boatswain,\r\n"where the men of the _Jane_ might have landed on one or another of\r\nthem, I don\'t believe in them."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because William Guy, who can only have had a small craft at his\r\ndisposal, could not have got so far into these seas."\r\n\r\n"I do not feel quite so sure of that."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Jeorling--"\r\n\r\n"What would there be so surprising in William Guy\'s being\r\ncarried to land somewhere by the action of the currents? He did not\r\nremain on board his boat for eight months, I suppose. His companions\r\nand he may have been able to land on an island, or even on a\r\ncontinent, and that is a sufficient motive for us to pursue our\r\nsearch."\r\n\r\n"No doubt--but all are not of your opinion," replied\r\nHurliguerly, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n"I know," said I, "and that is what makes me most anxious. Is\r\nthe ill-feeling increasing?"\r\n\r\n"I fear so, Mr. Jeorling. The satisfaction of having gained\r\nseveral hundreds of dollars is already lessened, and the prospect of\r\ngaining a few more hundreds does not put a stop to disputes. And yet\r\nthe prize is tempting! From Tsalal Island to the pole, admitting\r\nthat we might get there, is six degrees. Now six degrees at two\r\nthousand dollars each makes twelve thousand dollars for thirty men,\r\nthat is four hundred dollars a head. A nice little sum to slip into\r\none\'s pocket on the return of the _Halbrane_, but, notwithstanding,\r\nthat fellow Hearne works so wickedly upon his comrades that I\r\nbelieve they are ready to \xe2\x80\x98bout ship in spite of anybody."\r\n\r\n"I can believe that of the recruits, boatswain, but the old\r\ncrew--"\r\n\r\n"H--m! there are three or four of those who are beginning to\r\nreflect, and they are not easy in their minds about the prolongation\r\nof the voyage."\r\n\r\n"I fancy Captain Len Guy and his lieutenant will know how to get\r\nthemselves obeyed."\r\n\r\n"We shall see, Mr. Jeorling. But may it not be that our captain\r\nhimself will get disheartened; that the sense of his responsibility\r\nwill prevail, and that he will renounce his enterprise?"\r\n\r\nYes! this was what I feared, and there was no remedy on that side.\r\n\r\n"As for my friend Endicott, Mr. Jeorling, I answer for him as for\r\nmyself. We would go to the end of the world--if the world has an\r\nend--did the captain want to go there. True, we two, Dirk Peters\r\nand yourself, are but a few to be a law to the others."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think of the half-breed?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, our men appear to accuse him chiefly of the prolongation of\r\nthe voyage. You see, Mr. Jeorling, though you have a good deal to do\r\nwith it, you pay, and pay well, while this crazy fellow, Dirk\r\nPeters, persists in asserting that his poor Pym is still\r\nliving--his poor Pym who was drowned, or frozen, or crushed--killed,\r\nanyhow, one way or another, eleven years ago!"\r\n\r\nSo completely was this my own belief that I never discussed the\r\nsubject with the half-breed.\r\n\r\n"You see, Mr. Jeorling," resumed the boatswain, "at the first\r\nsome curiosity was felt about Dirk Peters. Then, after he saved\r\nMartin Holt, it was interest. Certainly, he was no more talkative\r\nthan before, and the bear came no oftener out of his den! But now we\r\nknow what he is, and no one likes him the better for that. At all\r\nevents it was he who induced our captain, by talking of land to the\r\nsouth of Tsalal Island, to make this voyage, and it is owing to him\r\nthat he has reached the eighty-sixth degree of latitude."\r\n\r\n"That is quite true, boatswain."\r\n\r\n"And so, Mr. Jeorling, I am always afraid that one of these days\r\nsomebody will do Peters an ill turn."\r\n\r\n"Dirk Peters would defend himself, and I should pity the man who\r\nlaid a finger on him."\r\n\r\n"Quite so. It would not be good for anybody to be in his hands,\r\nfor they could bend iron! But then, all being against him, he would\r\nbe forced into the hold."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we have not yet come to that, I hope, and I count on\r\nyou, Hurliguerly, to prevent any attempt against Dirk Peters. Reason\r\nwith your men. Make them understand that we have time to return to the\r\nFalklands before the end of the fine season. Their reproaches must\r\nnot be allowed to provide the captain with an excuse for turning\r\nback before the object is attained."\r\n\r\n"Count on me, Mr. Jeorling, I will serve you to the best of my\r\nability."\r\n\r\n"You will not repent of doing so, Hurliguerly. Nothing is easier\r\nthan to add a round 0 to the four hundred dollars which each man is\r\nto have, if that man be something more than a sailor--even were his\r\nfunctions simply those of boatswain on board the _Halbrane_."\r\n\r\nNothing important occurred on the 13th and 14th, but a fresh fall in\r\nthe temperature took place. Captain Len Guy called my attention to\r\nthis, pointing out the flocks of birds continuously flying north.\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking to me I felt that his last hopes were fading.\r\nAnd who could wonder? Of the land indicated by the half-breed\r\nnothing was seen, and we were already more than one hundred and\r\neighty miles from Tsalal Island. At every point of the compass was the\r\nsea, nothing but the vast sea with its desert horizon which the\r\nsun\'s disk had been nearing since the 21st of December, and would touch\r\non the 21st March, prior to disappearing during the six months of the\r\naustral night. Honestly, was it possible to admit that William Guy and\r\nhis five companions could have accomplished such a distance on a frail\r\ncraft, and was there one chance in a hundred that they could ever be\r\nrecovered?\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of January an observation most carefully taken gave 43\xc2\xb0 13\'\r\nlongitude and 88\xc2\xb0 17\' latitude. The _Halbrane_ was less than two\r\ndegrees from the pole.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy did not seek to conceal the result of this\r\nobservation, and the sailors knew enough of nautical calculation to\r\nunderstand it. Besides, if the consequences had to be explained to\r\nthem, were not Holt and Hardy there to do this, and Hearne, to\r\nexaggerate them to the utmost?\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon I had indubitable proof that the sealing-master\r\nhad been working on the minds of the crew. The men, emerging at the\r\nfoot of the mainmast, talked in whispers and cast evil glances at\r\nus. Two or three sailors made threatening gestures undisguisedly;\r\nthen arose such angry mutterings that West could not to be deaf to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe strode forward and called out: "Silence, there! The first man\r\nwho speaks will have to reckon with me!"\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy was shut up in his cabin, but every moment I\r\nexpected to see him come out, give one last look around the waste of\r\nwaters, and then order the ship\'s course to be reversed.\r\nNevertheless, on the next day the schooner was sailing in the same\r\ndirection. Unfortunately--for the circumstance had some gravity--a\r\nmist was beginning to come down on us. I could not keep still, I\r\nconfess. My apprehensions were redoubled. It was evident that West was\r\nonly awaiting the order to change the helm. What mortal anguish soever\r\nthe captain\'s must be, I understood too well that he would not give\r\nthat order without hesitation.\r\n\r\nFor several days past I had not seen the half-breed, or, at least, I\r\nhad not exchanged a word with him. He was boycotted by the whole\r\ncrew, with the exception of the boatswain, who was careful to\r\naddress him, although he rarely got a word in return. Dirk Peters took\r\nnot the faintest notice of this state of things. He remained completely\r\nabsorbed in his own thoughts, yet, had he heard West give the word\r\nto steer north, I know not to what acts of violence he might have been\r\ndriven. He seemed to avoid me; was this from a desire not to\r\ncompromise me?\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, in the afternoon, however, Dirk Peters manifested an\r\nintention of speaking to me, and never, no, never, could I have\r\nimagined what I was to learn in that interview.\r\n\r\nIt was about half-past two, and, not feeling well, I had gone to my\r\ncabin, where the side window was open, while that at the back was\r\nclosed. I heard a knock at the door, and asked who was there.\r\n\r\n"Dirk Peters," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"You want to speak to me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I am coming out."\r\n\r\n"If you please--I should prefer--may I come into your cabin?"\r\n\r\n"Come in."\r\n\r\nHe entered, and shut the door behind him.\r\n\r\nWithout rising I signed to him to seat himself in the arm-chair, but he\r\nremained standing.\r\n\r\n"What do you want of me, Dirk Peters?" I asked at length, as he\r\nseemed unable to make up his mind to speak.\r\n\r\n"I want to tell you something--because it seems well that you\r\nshould know it, and you only. In the crew--they must never know\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"If it is a grave matter, and you fear any indiscretion, Dirk\r\nPeters, why do you speak to me?"\r\n\r\n"If!--I must! Ah, yes! I must! It is impossible to keep it there!\r\nIt weighs on me like a stone."\r\n\r\nAnd Dirk Peters struck his breast violently.\r\n\r\nThen he resumed:\r\n\r\n"Yes! I am always afraid it may escape me during my sleep, and\r\nthat someone will hear it, for I dream of it, and in dreaming--"\r\n\r\n"You dream," I replied, "and of what?"\r\n\r\n"Of him, of him. Therefore it is that I sleep in corners, all\r\nalone, for fear that his true name should be discovered."\r\n\r\nThen it struck me that the half-breed was perhaps about to respond\r\nto an inquiry which I had not yet made--why he had gone to live at\r\nthe Falklands under the name of Hunt after leaving Illinois?\r\n\r\nI put the question to him, and he replied,--\r\n\r\n"It is not that; no, it is not that I wish--"\r\n\r\n"I insist, Dirk Peters, and I desire to know in the first place\r\nfor what reason you did not remain in America, for what reason you\r\nchose the Falklands--"\r\n\r\n"For what reason, sir? Because I wanted to get near Pym, my poor\r\nPym--because I hoped to find an opportunity at the Falklands of\r\nembarking on a whaling ship bound for the southern sea."\r\n\r\n"But that name of Hunt?"\r\n\r\n"I would not bear my own name any longer--on account of the\r\naffair of the _Grampus_."\r\n\r\nThe half-breed was alluding to the scene of the "short straw"\r\n(or lot-drawing) on board the American brig, when it was decided\r\nbetween Augustus Barnard, Arthur Pym, Dirk Peters, and Parker, the\r\nsailor, that one of the four should be sacrificed--as food for the\r\nthree others. I remembered the obstinate resistance of Arthur Pym,\r\nand how it was impossible for him to refuse to take his part in\r\nthe tragedy about to be performed--he says this himself--and the\r\nhorrible act whose remembrance must poison the existence of all\r\nthose who had survived it.\r\n\r\nOh, that lot-drawing! The "short straws" were little splinters\r\nof wood of uneven length which Arthur Pym held in his hand. The\r\nshortest was to designate him who should be immolated. And he speaks\r\nof the sort of involuntary fierce desire to deceive his companions\r\nthat he felt--"to cheat" is the word he uses--but he did not "cheat,"\r\nand he asks pardon for having had the idea! Let us try to put\r\nourselves in his place!\r\n\r\nHe made up his mind, and held out his hand, closed on the four\r\nslips. Dirk Peters drew the first. Fate had favoured him. He had\r\nnothing more to fear. Arthur Pym calculated that one more chance was\r\nagainst him. Augustus Barnard drew in his turn. Saved, too, he! And now\r\nArthur Pym reckoned up the exact chances between Parker and himself.\r\nAt that moment all the ferocity of the tiger entered into his soul. He\r\nconceived an intense and devilish hatred of his poor comrade, his\r\nfellow-man.\r\n\r\nFive minutes elapsed before Parker dared to draw. At length Arthur\r\nPym, standing with closed eyes, not knowing whether the lot was for\r\nor against him, felt a hand seize his own. It was the hand of Dirk\r\nPeters. Arthur Pym had escaped death. And then the half-breed rushed\r\nupon Parker and stabbed him in the back. The frightful repast\r\nfollowed--immediately--and words are not sufficient to convey to\r\nthe mind the horror of the reality.\r\n\r\nYes! I knew that hideous story, not a fable, as I had long believed.\r\nThis was what had happened on board the _Grampus_, on the 16th of\r\nJuly, 1827, and vainly did I try to understand Dirk Peters\' reason\r\nfor recalling it to my recollection.\r\n\r\n"Well, Dirk Peters," I said, "I will ask you, since you were\r\nanxious to hide your name, what it was that induced you to reveal\r\nit, when the _Halbrane_ was moored off Tsalal Island; why you did not\r\nkeep to the name of Hunt?"\r\n\r\n"Sir--understand me--there was hesitation about going\r\nfarther--they wanted to turn back. This was decided, and then I\r\nthought that by telling who I was--Dirk Peters--of the _Grampus_--poor\r\nPym\'s companion--I should be heard; they would believe with me that he\r\nwas still living, they would go in search of him! And yet, it was a\r\nserious thing to do--to acknowledge that I was Dirk Peters, he who had\r\nkilled Parker! But hunger, devouring hunger!"\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Dirk Peters," said I, "you exaggerate! If the lot\r\nhad fallen to you, you would have incurred the fate of Parker. You\r\ncannot be charged with a crime."\r\n\r\n"Sir, would Parker\'s family speak of it as you do?"\r\n\r\n"His family! Had he then relations?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--and that is why Pym changed his name in the narrative.\r\nParker\'s name was not Parker--it was--"\r\n\r\n"Arthur Pym was right," I said, interrupting him quickly, "and\r\nas for me, I do not wish to know Parker\'s real name. Keep this\r\nsecret."\r\n\r\n"No, I will tell it to you. It weighs too heavily on me, and I\r\nshall be relieved, perhaps, when I have told you, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"No, Dirk Peters, no!"\r\n\r\n"His name was Holt--Ned Holt."\r\n\r\n"Holt!" I exclaimed, "the same name as our sailing-master\'s."\r\n\r\n"Who is his own brother, sir."\r\n\r\n"Martin Holt?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--understand me--his brother."\r\n\r\n"But he believes that Ned Holt perished in the wreck of the\r\n_Grampus_ with the rest."\r\n\r\n"It was not so, and if he learned that I--"\r\n\r\nJust at that instant a violent shock flung me out of my bunk.\r\n\r\nThe schooner had made such a lurch to the port side that she was\r\nnear foundering.\r\n\r\nI heard an angry voice cry out:\r\n\r\n"What dog is that at the helm?"\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of West, and the person he addressed was Hearne.\r\n\r\nI rushed out of my cabin.\r\n\r\n"Have you let the wheel go?" repeated West, who had seized\r\nHearne by the collar of his jersey.\r\n\r\n"Lieutenant--I don\'t know--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I tell you, you have let it go. A little more and the\r\nschooner would have capsized under full sail."\r\n\r\n"Gratian," cried West, calling one of the sailors, "take the\r\nhelm; and you, Hearne, go down into the hold."\r\n\r\nOn a sudden the cry of "Land!" resounded, and every eye was\r\nturned southwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nLAND?\r\n\r\n\r\n"Land" is the only word to be found at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth chapter of Edgar Poe\'s book. I thought it would be a\r\ngood idea--placing after it a note of interrogation--to put it as\r\na heading to this portion of our narrative.\r\n\r\nDid that word, dropped from our fore-masthead, indicate an island or\r\na continent? And, whether a continent or an island, did not a\r\ndisappointment await us? Could they be there whom we had come to\r\nseek? And Arthur Pym, who was dead, unquestionably dead, in spite of\r\nDirk Peters\' assertions, had he ever set foot on this land?\r\n\r\nWhen the welcome word resounded on board the _Jane_ on the 17th\r\nJanuary, 1828--(a day full of incidents according to Arthur Pym\'s\r\ndiary)--it was succeeded by "Land on the starboard bow!" Such\r\nmight have been the signal from the masthead of the _Halbrane_.\r\n\r\nThe outlines of land lightly drawn above the sky line were visible\r\non this side.\r\n\r\nThe land announced to the sailors of the _Jane_ was the wild and\r\nbarren Bennet Islet. Less than one degree south of it lay Tsalal\r\nIsland, then fertile, habitable and inhabited, and on which Captain\r\nLen Guy had hoped to meet his fellow-countrymen. But what would this\r\nunknown island, five degrees farther off in the depths of the\r\nsouthern sea, be for our schooner? Was it the goal so ardently\r\ndesired and so earnestly sought for? Were the two brothers, William\r\nand Len Guy, to meet at this place? Would the _Halbrane_ come there to\r\nthe end of a voyage whose success would be definitely secured by the\r\nrestoration of the survivors of the _Jane_ to their country?\r\n\r\nI repeat that I was just like the half-breed. Our aim was not merely\r\nto discover the survivors, nor was success in this matter the only\r\nsuccess we looked for. However, since land was before our eyes, we\r\nmust get nearer to it first.\r\n\r\nThat cry of "Land" caused an immediate diversion of our\r\nthoughts. I no longer dwelt upon the secret Dirk Peters had just\r\ntold me--and perhaps the half-breed forgot it also, for he rushed\r\nto the bow and fixed his eyes immovably on the horizon. As for West,\r\nwhom nothing could divert from his duty, he repeated his commands.\r\nGratian came to take the helm, and Hearne was shut up in the hold.\r\n\r\nOn the whole this was a just punishment, and none of the old crew\r\nprotested against it, for Hearne\'s inattention or awkwardness had\r\nreally endangered the schooner, though for a short time only.\r\n\r\nFive or six of the Falklands sailors did, however, murmur a little.\r\n\r\nA sign from the mate silenced them, and they returned at once to\r\ntheir posts.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Captain Len Guy, upon hearing the cry of the\r\nlook-out man, had tumbled up from his cabin and eagerly examined\r\nthis land at ten or twelve miles distance.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I was no longer thinking about the secret Dirk\r\nPeters had confided to me. Besides, so long as the secret remained\r\nbetween us two--and neither would betray it--there would be\r\nnothing to fear. But if ever an unlucky accident were to reveal to\r\nMartin Holt that his brother\'s name had been changed to Parker,\r\nthat the unfortunate man had not perished in the shipwreck of the\r\n_Grampus_, but had been sacrificed to save his companions from\r\nperishing of hunger; that Dirk Peters, to whom Martin Holt himself\r\nowed his life, had killed him with his own hand, what might not\r\nhappen then? This was the reason why the half-breed shrank from any\r\nexpression of thanks from Martin Holt--why he avoided Martin Holt,\r\nthe victim\'s brother.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain had just struck six bells. The schooner was sailing\r\nwith the caution demanded by navigation in unknown seas. There might\r\nbe shoals or reefs barely hidden under the surface on which she\r\nmight run aground or be wrecked. As things stood with the _Halbrane_,\r\nand even admitting that she could be floated again, an accident\r\nwould have rendered her return impossible before the winter set in.\r\nWe had urgent need that every chance should be in our favour and not\r\none against us.\r\n\r\nWest had given orders to shorten sail. When the boatswain had furled\r\nthe top-gallant-sail, the top-sail and royal, the _Halbrane_ remained\r\nunder her mainsail, her fore-sail and her jib: sufficient canvas to\r\ncover the distance that separated her from land in a few hours.\r\nCaptain Len Guy immediately heaved the lead, which showed a depth of\r\ntwenty fathoms. Several other soundings showed that the coast, which\r\nwas very steep, was probably prolonged like a wall under the water.\r\nNevertheless, as the bottom might happen to rise sharply instead of\r\nfollowing the slope of the coast, we did not venture to proceed without\r\nthe sounding line in hand.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still beautiful, although the sky was overcast by a\r\nmist from south-east to south-west. Owing to this there was some\r\ndifficulty in identifying the vague outlines which stood out like\r\nfloating vapour in the sky, disappearing and then reappearing\r\nbetween the breaks of the mist.\r\n\r\nHowever, we all agreed to regard this land as being from twenty-five\r\nto thirty fathoms in height, at least at its highest part.\r\n\r\nNo! we would not admit that we were the victims of a delusion, and\r\nyet our uneasy minds feared that it might be so!\r\n\r\nIs it not natural, after all, for the heart to be assailed by a\r\nthousand apprehensions as we near the end of any enterprise? At this\r\nthought my mind became confused and dreamy. The _Halbrane_ seemed to\r\nbe reduced to the dimensions of a small boat lost in this boundless\r\nspace--the contrary of that limitless sea of which Edgar Poe\r\nspeaks, where, like a living body, the ship grows larger.\r\n\r\nWhen we have charts, or even sailing directions to instruct us\r\nconcerning the hydrography of the coasts, the nature of the\r\nlandfalls, the bays and the creeks, we may sail along boldly. In\r\nevery other region, the master of a ship must not defer the order to\r\ncast anchor near the shore until the morrow. But, where we were,\r\nwhat an amount of prudence was necessary! And yet, no manifest\r\nobstacle was before us. Moreover, we had no cause to fear that the\r\nlight would fail us during the sunny hours of the night. At this season\r\nthe sun did not set so soon under the western horizon, and its rays\r\nbathed the vast Antarctic zone in unabated light.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward the ship\'s log recorded that the temperature\r\nfell continuously. The thermometer in the air and in the shade did\r\nnot mark more than 32\xc2\xb0 (0\xc2\xb0 C.), and when plunged into water it\r\nonly indicated 26\xc2\xb0 (3\xc2\xb0 33\' C. below 0\xc2\xb0). What could be the\r\ncause of this fall, since we were at the height of the southern\r\nsummer? The crew were obliged to resume their woollen clothing,\r\nwhich they had left off a month previously. The schooner, however,\r\nwas sailing before the wind, and these first cold blasts were less\r\nkeenly felt. Yet we recognized the necessity of reaching our goal as\r\nsoon as possible. To linger in this region or to expose ourselves to\r\nthe danger of wintering out would be to tempt Providence!\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy tested the direction of the current repeatedly by heavy\r\nlead lines, and discovered that it was beginning to deviate from its\r\nformer course.\r\n\r\n"Whether it is a continent," said he, "that lies before us, or\r\nwhether it is an island, we have at present no means of determining.\r\nIf it be a continent, we must conclude that the current has an issue\r\ntowards the south-east."\r\n\r\n"And it is quite possible," I replied, "that the solid part of\r\nthe Antarctic region may be reduced to a mere polar mound. In any\r\ncase, it is well to note any of those observations which are likely\r\nto be accurate."\r\n\r\n"That is just what I am doing, Mr. Jeorling, and we shall bring\r\nback a mass of information about this portion of the southern sea\r\nwhich will prove useful to navigators."\r\n\r\n"If ever any venture to come so far south, captain! We have\r\npenetrated so far, thanks to the help of particular circumstances,\r\nthe earliness of the summer season, an abnormal temperature and a\r\nrapid thaw. Such conditions may only occur once in twenty or fifty\r\nyears!"\r\n\r\n"Wherefore, Mr. Jeorling, I thank Providence for this, and hope\r\nrevives in me to some extent. As the weather has been constantly\r\nfine, what is there to make it impossible for my brother and my\r\nfellow-countrymen to have landed on this coast, whither the wind and\r\nthe tide bore them? What our schooner has done, their boat may have\r\ndone! They surely did not start on a voyage which might be prolonged to\r\nan indefinite time without a proper supply of provisions! Why should\r\nthey not have found the resources as those afforded to them by the\r\nisland of Tsalal during many long years? They had ammunition and\r\narms elsewhere. Fish abound in these waters, water-fowl also. Oh\r\nyes! my heart is full of hope, and I wish I were a few hours\r\nolder!"\r\n\r\nWithout being quite so sanguine as Len Guy, I was glad to see he had\r\nregained his hopeful mood. Perhaps, if his investigations were\r\nsuccessful, I might be able to have them continued in Arthur Pym\'s\r\ninterest--even into the heart of this strange land which we were\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nThe _Halbrane_ was going along slowly on these clear waters, which\r\nswarmed with fish belonging to the same species as we had already\r\nmet. The sea-birds were more numerous, and were evidently not\r\nfrightened; for they kept flying round the mast, or perching in the\r\nyards. Several whitish ropes about five or six feet long were\r\nbrought on board. They were chaplets formed of millions of\r\npearly shell-fish.\r\n\r\nWhales, spouting jets of feathery water from their blow-holes,\r\nappeared at a distance, and I remarked that all of them took a\r\nsoutherly direction. There was therefore reason to believe that the\r\nsea extended far and wide in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe schooner covered two or three miles of her course without any\r\nincrease of speed. This coast evidently stretched from north-west to\r\nsouth-east. Nevertheless, the telescopes revealed no distinctive\r\nfeatures--even after three hours\' navigation.\r\n\r\nThe crew, gathered together on the forecastle, were looking on\r\nwithout revealing their impressions. West, after going aloft to the\r\nfore-cross-trees, where he had remained ten minutes, had reported\r\nnothing precise. Stationed at the port side, leaning my elbows on\r\nthe bulwarks, I closely watched the sky line, broken only towards\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the boatswain rejoined me, and without preface said:\r\n\r\n"Will you allow me to give you my opinion, Mr. Jeorling?"\r\n\r\n"Give it, boatswain," I replied, "at the risk of my not\r\nadopting it if I don\'t agree with it."\r\n\r\n"It is correct, and according as we get nearer one must really be\r\nblind not to adopt it!"\r\n\r\n"And what idea have you got?"\r\n\r\n"That it is not land which lies before us, Mr. Jeorling!"\r\n\r\n"What is it you are saying?"\r\n\r\n"Look attentively, putting one finger before your eyes--look\r\nthere--out a--starboard."\r\n\r\nI did as Hurliguerly directed.\r\n\r\n"Do you see?" he began again. "May I lose my liking for my\r\ngrog if these heights do not change place, not with regard to the\r\nschooner, but with regard to themselves!"\r\n\r\n"And what do you conclude from this?"\r\n\r\n"That they are moving icebergs."\r\n\r\n"Icebergs?"\r\n\r\n"Sure enough, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\nWas not the boatswain mistaken? Were we in for a disappointment?\r\nWere there only drifting ice-mountains in the distance instead of a\r\nshore?\r\n\r\nPresently, there was no doubt on the subject; for some time past the\r\ncrew had no longer believed in the existence of land in that direction.\r\n\r\nTen minutes afterwards, the man in the crow\'s-nest announced that\r\nseveral icebergs were coming from the north-west, in an oblique\r\ndirection, into the course of the _Halbrane_.\r\n\r\nThis news produced a great sensation on board. Our last hope was\r\nsuddenly extinguished. And what a blow to Captain Len Guy! We should\r\nhave to seek this land of the austral zone under higher latitudes\r\nwithout being sure of ever coming across it!\r\n\r\nAnd then the cry, "Back ship! back ship!" resounded almost\r\nunanimously on board the _Halbrane_.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, the recruits from the Falklands were demanding that we\r\nshould turn back, although Hearne was not there to fan the flame of\r\ninsubordination, and I must acknowledge that the greater part of the\r\nold tars seemed to agree with them.\r\n\r\nWest awaited his chief\'s orders, not daring to impose silence.\r\n\r\nGratian was at the helm, ready to give a turn to the wheel, whilst his\r\ncomrades with their hands on the cleats were preparing to ease off\r\nthe sheets.\r\n\r\nDirk Peters remained immovable, leaning against the fore-mast, his\r\nhead down, his body bent, and his mouth set firm. Not a word passed\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\nBut now he turned towards me, and what a look of mingled wrath and\r\nentreaty he gave me!\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what irresistible motive induced me to interfere\r\npersonally, and once again to protest! A final argument had just\r\ncrossed my mind--an argument whose weight could not be disputed.\r\n\r\nSo I began to speak, and I did so with such conviction that none\r\ntried to interrupt me.\r\n\r\nThe substance of what I said was as follows:--\r\n\r\n"No! all hope must not be abandoned. Land cannot be far off. The\r\nicebergs which are formed in the open sea by the accumulation of ice\r\nare not before us. These icebergs must have broken off from the\r\nsolid base of a continent or an island. Now, since the thaw begins\r\nat this season of the year, the drift will last for only a short\r\ntime. Behind them we must meet the coast on which they were formed.\r\nIn another twenty-four hours, or forty-eight at the most, if the\r\nland does not appear, Captain Len Guy will steer to the north again!"\r\n\r\nHad I convinced the crew, or ought I to take advantage of Hearne\'s\r\nabsence and of the fact that he could not communicate with them to\r\nmake them understand that they were being deceived, and to repeat to\r\nthem that it would endanger the schooner if our course were now to\r\nbe reversed.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain came to my help, and in a good-humoured voice\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Very well reasoned, and for my part I accept Mr. Jeorling\'s\r\nopinion. Assuredly, land is near! If we seek it beyond those\r\nicebergs, we shall discover it without much hard work, or great\r\ndanger! What is one degree farther south, when it is a question of\r\nputting a hundred additional dollars into one\'s pocket? And let us\r\nnot forget that if they are acceptable when they go in, they are\r\nnone the less so when they come out!"\r\n\r\nUpon this, Endicott, the cook, came to the aid of his friend the\r\nboatswain.\r\n\r\n"Yes, very good things indeed are dollars!" cried he, showing\r\ntwo rows of shining white teeth.\r\n\r\nDid the crew intend to yield to Hurliguerly\'s argument, or would\r\nthey try to resist if the _Halbrane_ went on in the direction of the\r\nicebergs?\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy took up his telescope again, and turned it upon\r\nthese moving masses; he observed them with much attention, and cried\r\nout in a loud voice,--\r\n\r\n"Steer south-sou\'-west!"\r\n\r\nWest gave orders to execute the manoeuvres. The sailors hesitated an\r\ninstant. Then, recalled to obedience, they began to brace the yards\r\nand slack the sheets, and the schooner increased her speed.\r\n\r\nWhen the operation was over, I went up to Hurliguerly, and drawing\r\nhim aside, I said,--\r\n\r\n"Thank you, boatswain."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Mr. Jeorling," he replied, shaking his head, "it is all\r\nvery fine for this time, but you must not do it again! Everyone\r\nwould turn against me, even Endicott, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I have urged nothing which is not at least probable," I\r\nanswered sharply.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t deny that fact, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Hurliguerly, yes--I believe what I have said, and I have no\r\ndoubt but that we shall really see the land beyond the icebergs."\r\n\r\n"Just possible, Mr. Jeorling, quite possible. But it must appear\r\nbefore two days, or, on the word of a boatswain, nothing can prevent\r\nus from putting about!"\r\n\r\nDuring the next twenty-four hours the _Halbrane_ took a\r\nsouth-south-westerly course. Nevertheless, her direction must have\r\nbeen frequently changed and her speed decreased in avoiding the ice.\r\nThe navigation became very difficult so soon as the schooner headed\r\ntowards the line of the bergs, which it had to cut obliquely.\r\nHowever, there were none of the packs which blocked up all access to\r\nthe iceberg on the 67th parallel. The enormous heaps were melting\r\naway with majestic slowness. The ice-blocks appeared "quite new"\r\n(to employ a perfectly accurate expression), and perhaps they had\r\nonly been formed some days. However, with a height of one hundred\r\nand fifty feet, their bulk must have been calculated by millions of\r\ntons. West was watching closely in order to avoid collisions, and\r\ndid not leave the deck even for an instant.\r\n\r\nUntil now, Captain Len Guy had always been able to rely upon the\r\nindications of the compass. The magnetic pole, still hundreds of\r\nmiles off, had no influence on the compass, its direction being\r\neast. The needle remained steady, and might be trusted.\r\n\r\nSo, in spite of my conviction, founded, however, on very serious\r\narguments, there was no sign of land, and I was wondering whether it\r\nwould not be better to steer more to the west, at the risk of\r\nremoving the _Halbrane_ from that extreme point where the meridians of\r\nthe globe cross each other.\r\n\r\nThus, as the hours went by--and I was only allowed forty-eight--it\r\nwas only too plain that lack of courage prevailed, and that everyone\r\nwas inclined to be insubordinate. After another day and a half, I could\r\nno longer contend with the general discontent. The schooner must\r\nultimately retrace her course towards the north.\r\n\r\nThe crew were working in silence, whilst West was giving sharp short\r\norders for manoeuvring through the channels, sometimes luffing in\r\norder to avoid a collision, now bearing away almost square before\r\nthe wind. Nevertheless, in spite of a close watch, in spite of the\r\nskill of the sailors, in spite of the prompt execution of the\r\nmanoeuvres, dangerous friction against the hull, which left long\r\ntraces of the ridge of the icebergs, occurred. And, in truth, the\r\nbravest could not repress a feeling of terror when thinking that the\r\nplanking might have given way and the sea have invaded us.\r\n\r\nThe base of these floating ice-mountains was very steep, so that it\r\nwould have been impossible for us to land upon one. Moreover, we saw\r\nno seals--these were usually very numerous where the ice-fields\r\nabounded--nor even a flock of the screeching penguins which, on\r\nother occasions, the _Halbrane_ sent diving by myriads as she passed\r\nthrough them; the birds themselves seemed rarer and wilder. Dread,\r\nfrom which none of us could escape, seemed to come upon us from\r\nthese desolate and deserted regions. How could we still entertain a\r\nhope that the survivors of the _Jane_ had found shelter, and obtained\r\nmeans of existence in those awful solitudes?\r\n\r\nAnd if the _Halbrane_ were also shipwrecked, would there remain any\r\nevidence of her fate?\r\n\r\nSince the previous day, from the moment our southern course had been\r\nabandoned, to cut the line of the icebergs, a change had taken place\r\nin the demeanour of the half-breed. Nearly always crouched down at\r\nthe foot of the fore-mast, looking afar into the boundless space, he\r\nonly got up in order to lend a hand to some manoeuvre, and without\r\nany of his former vigilance or zeal. Not that he had ceased to\r\nbelieve that his comrade of the _Jane_ was still living--that thought\r\nnever even came into his mind! But he felt by instinct that the\r\ntraces of poor Pym were not to be recovered by following this course.\r\n\r\n"Sir," he would have said to me, "this is not the way! No,\r\nthis is not the way!" And how could I have answered him?\r\n\r\nTowards seven o\'clock in the evening a rather thick mist arose;\r\nthis would tend to make the navigation of the schooner difficult and\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nThe day, with its emotions of anxiety and alternatives, had worn me\r\nout. So I returned to my cabin, where I threw myself on my bunk in\r\nmy clothes.\r\n\r\nBut sleep did not come to me, owing to my besetting thoughts. I\r\nwillingly admit that the constant reading of Edgar Poe\'s works,\r\nand reading them in this place in which his heroes delighted, had\r\nexercised an influence on me which I did not fully recognize.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow, the forty-eight hours would be up, the last concession\r\nwhich the crew had made to my entreaties.\r\n\r\n"Things are not going as you wish?" the boatswain said to me\r\njust as I was leaving the deck.\r\n\r\nNo, certainly not, since land was not to be seen behind the fleet of\r\nicebergs. If no sign of a coast appeared between these moving\r\nmasses, Captain Len Guy would steer north to-morrow.\r\n\r\nAh! were I only master of the schooner! If I could have bought it\r\neven at the price of all my fortune, if these men had been my slaves\r\nto drive by the lash, the _Halbrane_ should never have given up this\r\nvoyage, even if it led her so far as the point above which flames\r\nthe Southern Cross.\r\n\r\nMy mind was quite upset, and teemed with a thousand thoughts, a\r\nthousand regrets, a thousand desires! I wanted to get up, but a\r\nheavy hand held me down in my bunk! And I longed to leave this cabin\r\nwhere I was struggling against nightmare in my half-sleep, to launch\r\none of the boats of the _Halbrane_, to jump into it with Dirk Peters,\r\nwho would not hesitate about following me, and so abandon both of us\r\nto the current running south.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I was doing this in a dream. It is to-morrow! Captain Len\r\nGuy has given orders to reverse our course, after a last glance at\r\nthe horizon. One of the boats is in tow. I warn the half-breed. We\r\ncreep along without being seen. We cut the painter. Whilst the\r\nschooner sails on ahead, we stay astern and the current carries us\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThus we drift on the sea without hindrance! At length our boat\r\nstops. Land is there. I see a sort of sphinx surmounting the\r\nsouthern peak--the sea-sphinx. I go to him. I question him. He\r\ndiscloses the secrets of these mysterious regions to me. And then,\r\nthe phenomena whose reality Arthur Pym asserted appear around the\r\nmythic monster. The curtain of flickering vapours, striped with\r\nluminous rays, is rent asunder. And it is not a face of superhuman\r\ngrandeur which arises before my astonished eyes: it is Arthur Pym,\r\nfierce guardian of the south pole, flaunting the ensign of the\r\nUnited States in those high latitudes!\r\n\r\nWas this dream suddenly interrupted, or was it changed by a freak of\r\nmy brain? I cannot tell, but I felt as though I had been suddenly\r\nawakened. It seemed as though a change had taken place in the motion\r\nof the schooner, which was sliding along on the surface of the quiet\r\nsea, with a slight list to starboard. And yet, there was neither\r\nrolling nor pitching. Yes, I felt myself carried off as though my\r\nbunk were the car of an air-balloon. I was not mistaken, and I had\r\nfallen from dreamland into reality.\r\n\r\nCrash succeeded crash overhead. I could not account for them. Inside\r\nmy cabin the partitions deviated from the vertical in such a way as\r\nto make one believe that the _Halbrane_ had fallen over on her beam\r\nends. Almost immediately, I was thrown out of my bunk and barely\r\nescaped splitting my skull against the corner of the table. However,\r\nI got up again, and, clinging on to the edge of the door frame, I\r\npropped myself against the door.\r\n\r\nAt this instant the bulwarks began to crack and the port side of the\r\nship was torn open.\r\n\r\nCould there have been a collision between the schooner and one of\r\nthose gigantic floating masses which West was unable to avoid in the\r\nmist?\r\n\r\nSuddenly loud shouts came from the after-deck, and then screams of\r\nterror, in which the maddened voices of the crew joined.\r\n\r\nAt length there came a final crash, and the _Halbrane_ remained\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nI had to crawl along the floor to reach the door and gain the deck.\r\nCaptain Len Guy having already left his cabin, dragged himself on\r\nhis knees, so great was the list to port, and caught on as best he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nIn the fore part of the ship, between the forecastle and the\r\nfore-mast, many heads appeared.\r\n\r\nDirk Peters, Hardy, Martin Holt and Endicott, the latter with his\r\nblack face quite vacant, were clinging to the starboard shrouds.\r\n\r\nA man came creeping up to me, because the slope of the deck\r\nprevented him from holding himself upright: it was Hurliguerly,\r\nworking himself along with his hands like a top-man on a yard.\r\n\r\nStretched out at full length, my feet propped up against the jamb of\r\nthe door, I held out my hand to the boatswain, and helped him, not\r\nwithout difficulty, to hoist himself up near me.\r\n\r\n"What is wrong?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"A stranding, Mr. Jeorling."\r\n\r\n"We are ashore!"\r\n\r\n"A shore presupposes land," replied the boatswain ironically,\r\n"and so far as land goes there was never any except in that rascal\r\nDirk Peters\' imagination."\r\n\r\n"But tell me--what has happened?"\r\n\r\n"We came upon an iceberg in the middle of the fog, and were unable\r\nto keep clear of it."\r\n\r\n"An iceberg, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, an iceberg, which has chosen just now to turn head over\r\nheels. In turning, it struck the _Halbrane_ and carried it off just as\r\na battledore catches a shuttlecock, and now here we are, stranded at\r\ncertainly one hundred feet above the level of the Antarctic Sea."\r\n\r\nCould one have imagined a more terrible conclusion to the\r\nadventurous voyage of the _Halbrane_?\r\n\r\nIn the middle of these remote regions our only means of transport\r\nhad just been snatched from its natural element, and carried off by\r\nthe turn of an iceberg to a height of more than one hundred feet!\r\nWhat a conclusion! To be swallowed up in a polar tempest, to be\r\ndestroyed in a fight with savages, to be crushed in the ice, such\r\nare the dangers to which any ship engaged in the polar seas is\r\nexposed! But to think that the _Halbrane_ had been lifted by a\r\nfloating mountain just as that mountain was turning over, was\r\nstranded and almost at its summit--no! such a thing seemed quite\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nI did not know whether we could succeed in letting down the schooner\r\nfrom this height with the means we had at our disposal. But I did\r\nknow that Captain Len Guy, the mate and the older members of the\r\ncrew, when they had recovered from their first fright, would not\r\ngive up in despair, no matter how terrible the situation might be;\r\nof that I had no doubt whatsoever! They would all look to the\r\ngeneral safety; as for the measures to be taken, no one yet knew\r\nanything. A foggy veil, a sort of greyish mist still hung over the\r\niceberg. Nothing could be seen of its enormous mass except the\r\nnarrow craggy cleft in which the schooner was wedged, nor even what\r\nplace it occupied in the middle of the ice-fleet drifting towards\r\nthe south-east.\r\n\r\nCommon prudence demanded that we should quit the _Halbrane_, which\r\nmight slide down at a sharp shake of the iceberg. Were we even\r\ncertain that the latter had regained its position on the surface of\r\nthe sea? Was her stability secure? Should we not be on the look-out\r\nfor a fresh upheaval? And if the schooner were to fall into the\r\nabyss, which of us could extricate himself safe and sound from such\r\na fall, and then from the final plunge into the depths of the ocean?\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the crew had abandoned the _Halbrane_. Each man\r\nsought for refuge on the ice-slopes, awaiting the time when the\r\niceberg should be freed from mist. The oblique rays from the sun did\r\nnot succeed in piercing it, and the red disk could hardly be\r\nperceived through the opaque mass.\r\n\r\nHowever, we could distinguish each other at about twelve feet apart.\r\nAs for the _Halbrane_, she looked like a confused blackish mass\r\nstanding out sharply against the whiteness of the ice.\r\n\r\nWe had now to ascertain whether any of those who were on the deck at\r\nthe time of the catastrophe had been thrown over the bulwarks and\r\nprecipitated into the sea?\r\n\r\nBy Captain Len Guy\'s orders all the sailors then present joined\r\nthe group in which I stood with the mate, the boatswain, Hardy and\r\nMartin Holt.\r\n\r\nSo far, this catastrophe had cost us five men--these were the first\r\nsince our departure from Kerguelen, but were they to be the last?\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that these unfortunate fellows had perished,\r\nbecause we called them in vain, and in vain we sought for them, when\r\nthe fog abated, along the sides of the iceberg, at every place where\r\nthey might have been able to catch on to a projection.\r\n\r\nWhen the disappearance of the five men had been ascertained, we fell\r\ninto despair. Then we felt more keenly than before the dangers which\r\nthreaten every expedition to the Antarctic zone.\r\n\r\n"What about Hearne?" said a voice.\r\n\r\nMartin Holt pronounced the name at a moment when there was general\r\nsilence. Had the sealing-master been crushed to death in the narrow\r\npart of the hold where he was shut up?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The _Halbrane_ fast in the iceberg.]\r\n\r\nWest rushed towards the schooner, hoisted himself on board by means\r\nof a rope hanging over the bows, and gained the hatch which gives\r\naccess to that part of the hold.\r\n\r\nWe waited silent and motionless to learn the fate of Hearne,\r\nalthough the evil spirit of the crew was but little worthy of our\r\npity.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, how many of us were then thinking that if we had heeded his\r\nadvice, and if the schooner had taken the northern course, a whole\r\ncrew would not have been reduced to take refuge on a drifting\r\nice-mountain! I scarcely dared to calculate my own share of the vast\r\nresponsibility, I who had so vehemently insisted on the prolongation\r\nof the voyage.\r\n\r\nAt length the mate reappeared on deck and Hearne followed him! By a\r\nmiracle, neither the bulkheads, nor the ribs, nor the planking had\r\nyielded at the place where the sealing-master was confined.\r\n\r\nHearne rejoined his comrades without opening his lips, and we had no\r\nfurther trouble about him.\r\n\r\nTowards six o\'clock in the morning the fog cleared off, owing to a\r\nmarked fall in the temperature. We had no longer to do with\r\ncompletely frozen vapour, but had to deal with the phenomenon called\r\nfrost-rime, which often occurs in these high latitudes. Captain Len\r\nGuy recognized it by the quantity of prismatic threads, the point\r\nfollowing the wind which roughened the light ice-crust deposited on\r\nthe sides of the iceberg. Navigators know better than to confound\r\nthis frost-rime with the hoar frost of the temperate zones, which\r\nonly freezes when it has been deposited on the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nWe were now enabled to estimate the size of the solid mass on which\r\nwe clustered like flies on a sugar-loaf, and the schooner, seen from\r\nbelow, looked no bigger than the yawl of a trading vessel.\r\n\r\nThis iceberg of between three and four hundred fathoms in\r\ncircumference measured from 130 to 140 feet high. According to all\r\ncalculations, therefore, its depth would be four or five times\r\ngreater, and it would consequently weigh millions of tons.\r\n\r\nThis is what had happened:\r\n\r\nThe iceberg, having been melted away at its base by contact with\r\nwarmer waters, had risen little by little; its centre of gravity had\r\nbecome displaced, and its equilibrium could only be re-established\r\nby a sudden capsize, which had lifted up the part that had been\r\nunderneath above the sea-level. The _Halbrane_, caught in this\r\nmovement, was hoisted as by an enormous lever. Numbers of icebergs\r\ncapsize thus on the polar seas, and form one of the greatest dangers\r\nto which approaching vessels are exposed.\r\n\r\nOur schooner was caught in a hollow on the west side of the iceberg.\r\nShe listed to starboard with her stern raised and her bow lowered.\r\nWe could not help thinking that the slightest shake would cause her\r\nto slide along the slope of the iceberg into the sea. The collision\r\nhad been so violent as to stave in some of the planks of her hull.\r\nAfter the first collision, the galley situated before the fore-mast\r\nhad broken its fastenings. The door between Captain Len Guy\'s and\r\nthe mate\'s cabins was torn away from the hinges. The topmast and\r\nthe top-gallant-mast had come down after the back-stays parted, and\r\nfresh fractures could plainly be seen as high as the cap of the\r\nmasthead.\r\n\r\nFragments of all kinds, yards, spars, a part of the sails, breakers,\r\ncases, hen-coops, were probably floating at the foot of the mass and\r\ndrifting with it.\r\n\r\nThe most alarming part of our situation was the fact that of the two\r\nboats belonging to the _Halbrane_, one had been stove in when we\r\ngrounded, and the other, the larger of the two, was still hanging on\r\nby its tackles to the starboard davits. Before anything else was\r\ndone this boat had to be put in a safe place, because it might prove\r\nour only means of escape.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the first examination, we found that the lower masts\r\nhad remained in their places, and might be of use if ever we\r\nsucceeded in releasing the schooner. But how were we to release her\r\nfrom her bed in the ice and restore her to her natural element?\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself with Captain Len Guy, the mate, and the\r\nboatswain, I questioned them on this subject.\r\n\r\n"I agree with you," replied West, "that the operation involves\r\ngreat risks, but since it is indispensable, we will accomplish it. I\r\nthink it will be necessary to dig out a sort of slide down to the\r\nbase of the iceberg."\r\n\r\n"And without the delay of a single day," added Captain Len Guy.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear, boatswain?" said Jem West. "Work begins to-day."\r\n\r\n"I hear, and everyone will set himself to the task," replied\r\nHurliguerly. "If you allow me, I shall just make one observation,\r\ncaptain."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Before beginning the work, let us examine the hull and see what\r\nthe damage is, and whether it can be repaired. For what use would it\r\nbe to launch a ship stripped of her planks, which would go to the\r\nbottom at once?"\r\n\r\nWe complied with the boatswain\'s just demand.\r\n\r\nThe fog having cleared off, a bright sun then illumined the eastern\r\nside of the iceberg, whence the sea was visible round a large part\r\nof the horizon. Here the sides of the iceberg showed rugged\r\nprojections, ledges, shoulders, and even flat instead of smooth\r\nsurfaces, giving no foothold. However, caution would be necessary in\r\norder to avoid the falling of those unbalanced blocks, which a\r\nsingle shock might set loose. And, as a matter of fact, during the\r\nmorning, several of these blocks did roll into the sea with a\r\nfrightful noise just like an avalanche.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the iceberg seemed to be very steady on its new base.\r\nSo long as the centre of gravity was below the level of the\r\nwater-line, there was no fear of a fresh capsize.\r\n\r\nI had not yet had an opportunity of speaking to Dirk Peters since\r\nthe catastrophe. As he had answered to his name, I knew he was not\r\nnumbered among the victims. At this moment, I perceived him standing\r\non a narrow projection; needless to specify the direction in which\r\nhis eyes were turned.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy, the mate, the boatswain, Hardy, and Martin Holt,\r\nwhom I accompanied, went up again towards the schooner in order to\r\nmake a minute investigation of the hull. On the starboard side the\r\noperation would be easy enough, because the _Halbrane_ had a list to\r\nthe opposite side. On the port side we would have to slide along to\r\nthe keel as well as we could by scooping out the ice, in order to\r\ninsure the inspection of every part of the planking.\r\n\r\nAfter an examination which lasted two hours, it was discovered that\r\nthe damage was of little importance, and could be repaired in a\r\nshort time. Two or three planks only were wrenched away by the\r\ncollision. In the inside the skin was intact, the ribs not having\r\ngiven way. Our vessel, constructed for the polar seas, had resisted\r\nwhere many others less solidly built would have been dashed to\r\npieces. The rudder had indeed been unshipped, but that could easily\r\nbe set right.\r\n\r\nHaving finished our inspection inside and outside, we agreed that\r\nthe damage was less considerable than we feared, and on that subject\r\nwe became reassured. Reassured! Yes, if we could only succeed in\r\ngetting the schooner afloat again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n"UNMERCIFUL DISASTER."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning, after breakfast, it was decided that the men should\r\nbegin to dig a sloping bed which would allow the _Halbrane_ to slide\r\nto the foot of the iceberg. Would that Heaven might grant success to\r\nthe operation, for who could contemplate without terror having to\r\nbrave the severity of the austral winter, and to pass six months\r\nunder such conditions as ours on a vast iceberg, dragged none could\r\ntell whither? Once the winter had set in, none of us could have\r\nescaped from that most terrible of fates--dying of cold.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Dirk Peters, who was observing the horizon from\r\nsouth to east at about one hundred paces off, cried out in a rough\r\nvoice: "Lying to!"\r\n\r\nLying to? What could the half-breed mean by that, except that the\r\nfloating mass had suddenly ceased to drift? As for the cause of this\r\nstoppage, it was neither the moment to investigate it, nor to ask\r\nourselves what the consequences were likely to be.\r\n\r\n"It is true, however," cried the boatswain. "The iceberg is\r\nnot stirring, and perhaps has not stirred since it capsized!"\r\n\r\n"How?" said I, "it no longer changes its place?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied the mate, "and the proof is that the others,\r\ndrifting on, are leaving it behind!"\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, whilst five or six icebergs were descending towards\r\nthe south, ours was as motionless as though it had been stranded on\r\na shoal.\r\n\r\nThe simplest explanation was that the new base had encountered\r\nground at the bottom of the sea to which it now adhered, and would\r\ncontinue to adhere, unless the submerged part rose in the water so\r\nas to cause a second capsize.\r\n\r\nThis complicated matters seriously, because the dangers of positive\r\nimmobility were such that the chances of drifting were preferable.\r\nAt least, in the latter case there was some hope of coming across a\r\ncontinent or an island, or even (if the currents did not change) of\r\ncrossing the boundaries of the austral region.\r\n\r\nHere we were, then, after three months of this terrible voyage! Was\r\nthere now any question of trying to save William Guy, his comrades\r\non the _Jane_, and Arthur Pym? Was it not for our own safety that any\r\nmeans at our disposal should be employed? And could it be wondered\r\nat were the sailors of the _Halbrane_ to rebel, were they to listen to\r\nHearne\'s suggestions, and make their officers, or myself\r\nespecially, responsible for the disasters of this expedition?\r\n\r\nMoreover, what was likely to take place, since, notwithstanding\r\ntheir losses, the followers of the sealing-master were still a\r\nmajority of the ship\'s company?\r\n\r\nThis question I could clearly see was occupying the thoughts of\r\nCaptain Len Guy and West.\r\n\r\nAgain, although the recruits from the Falklands formed only a total\r\nof fourteen men, as against the twelve of the old crew, was it not\r\nto be feared that some of the latter would take Hearne\'s side?\r\nWhat if Hearne\'s people, urged by despair, were already thinking\r\nof seizing the only boat we now possessed, setting off towards the\r\nnorth, and leaving us on this iceberg? It was, then, of great\r\nimportance that our boat should be put in safety and closely watched.\r\n\r\nA marked change had taken place in Captain Len Guy since the recent\r\noccurrences. He seemed to be transformed upon finding himself face\r\nto face with the dangers which menaced us. Up to that time he had\r\nbeen solely occupied in searching for his fellow-countrymen; he had\r\nhanded over the command of the schooner to West, and he could not\r\nhave given it to anyone more zealous and more capable. But from this\r\ndate he resumed his position as master of the ship, and used it with\r\nthe energy required by the circumstances; in a word, he again became\r\nsole master on board, after God.\r\n\r\nAt his command the crew were drawn up around him on a flat spot a\r\nlittle to the left of the _Halbrane_. In that place the following were\r\nassembled:--on the seniors\' side: Martin Holt and Hardy, Rogers,\r\nFrancis, Gratian, Bury, Stern, the cook (Endicott), and I may add\r\nDirk Peters; on the side of the new-comers, Hearne and the thirteen\r\nother Falkland sailors. The latter composed a distinct group; the\r\nsealing-master was their spokesman and exercised a baneful influence\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy cast a stern glance upon the men and said in a sharp\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n"Sailors of the _Halbrane_, I must first speak to you of our lost\r\ncompanions. Five of us have just perished in this catastrophe."\r\n\r\n"We are waiting to perish in our turn, in these seas, where we\r\nhave been dragged in spite of--"\r\n\r\n"Be silent, Hearne," cried West, pale with anger, "or if\r\nnot--"\r\n\r\n"Hearne has said what he had to say," Captain Len Guy continued,\r\ncoldly. "Now it is said, and I advise him not to interrupt me a\r\nsecond time!"\r\n\r\nThe sealing-master might possibly have ventured on an answer, for he\r\nfelt that he was backed by the majority of the crew; but Martin Holt\r\nheld him back, and he was silent.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy then took off his hat and pronounced the following\r\nwords with an emotion that affected us to the bottom of our hearts:--\r\n\r\n"We must pray for those who have died in this dangerous voyage,\r\nwhich was undertaken in the name of humanity. May God be pleased to\r\ntake into consideration the fact that they devoted their lives to\r\ntheir fellow-creatures, and may He not be insensible to our prayers!\r\nKneel down, sailors of the _Halbrane_!"\r\n\r\nThey all knelt down on the icy surface, and the murmurs of prayer\r\nascended towards heaven.\r\n\r\nWe waited for Captain Len Guy to rise before we did so.\r\n\r\n"Now," he resumed, "after those who are dead come those who\r\nhave survived. To them I say that they must obey me, whatever my\r\norders may be, and even in our present situation I shall not\r\ntolerate any hesitation or opposition. The responsibility for the\r\ngeneral safety is mine, and I will not yield any of it to anyone. I\r\nam master here, as on board--"\r\n\r\n"On board--when there is no longer a ship," muttered the\r\nsealing-master.\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken, Hearne, the vessel is there, and we will put it\r\nback into the sea. Besides, if we had only a boat, I am the captain\r\nof it. Let him beware who forgets this!"\r\n\r\nThat day, Captain Len Guy, having taken the height of the sun by the\r\nsextant and fixed the hour by the chronometer (both of these\r\ninstruments had escaped destruction in the collision), obtained the\r\nfollowing position of his ship:--\r\n\r\nSouth latitude: 88\xc2\xb0 55\'.\r\n\r\nWest longitude: 39\xc2\xb0 12\'.\r\n\r\nThe _Halbrane_ was only at 1\xc2\xb0 5\'--about 65 miles--from the south\r\npole.\r\n\r\n"All hands to work," was the captain\'s order that afternoon,\r\nand every one obeyed it with a will. There was not a moment to lose,\r\nas the question of time was more important than any other. So far\r\nas provisions were concerned, there was enough in the schooner for\r\neighteen months on full rations, so we were not threatened with\r\nhunger, nor with thirst either, notwithstanding that owing to the\r\nwater-casks having been burst in the collision, their contents had\r\nescaped through their staves. Luckily, the barrels of gin, whisky,\r\nbeer, and wine, being placed in the least exposed part of the hold,\r\nwere nearly all intact. Under this head we had experienced no loss,\r\nand the iceberg would supply us with good drinking-water. It is a\r\nwell-known fact that ice, whether formed from fresh or salt water,\r\ncontains no salt, owing to the chloride of sodium being eliminated\r\nin the change from the liquid to the solid state. The origin of the\r\nice, therefore, is a matter of no importance. However, those blocks\r\nwhich are easily distinguished by their greenish colour and their\r\nperfect transparency are preferable. They are solidified rain, and\r\ntherefore much more suitable for drinking-water.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, our captain would have recognized any blocks of this\r\ndescription, but none were to be found on the glacier, owing to its\r\nbeing that part of the berg which was originally submerged, and came\r\nto the top after the fall.\r\n\r\nThe captain and West decided first to lighten the vessel, by\r\nconveying everything on board to land. The masts were to be cleared\r\nof rigging, taken out, and placed on the plateau. It was necessary\r\nto lighten the vessel as much as possible, even to clear out the\r\nballast, owing to the difficult and dangerous operation of\r\nlaunching. It would be better to put off our departure for some days\r\nif this operation could be performed under more favourable\r\ncircumstances. The loading might be afterwards accomplished without\r\nmuch difficulty.\r\n\r\nBesides this, another reason by no means less serious presented\r\nitself to us. It would have been an act of unpardonable rashness to\r\nleave the provisions in the store-room of the _Halbrane_, her situation\r\non the side of the iceberg being very precarious. One shake would\r\nsuffice to detach the ship, and with her would have disappeared the\r\nsupplies on which our lives depended.\r\n\r\nOn this account, we passed the day in removing casks of half-salted\r\nmeat, dried vegetables, flour, biscuits, tea, coffee, barrels of\r\ngin, whisky, wine and beer from the hold and store-room and placing\r\nthem in safety in the hammocks near the _Halbrane_.\r\n\r\nWe also had to insure our landing against any possible accident,\r\nand, I must add, against any plot on the part of Hearne and others\r\nto seize the boat in order to return to the ice-barrier.\r\n\r\nWe placed the long boat in a cavity which would be easy to watch,\r\nabout thirty feet to the left of the schooner, along with its oars,\r\nrudder, compass, anchor, masts and sail.\r\n\r\nBy day there was nothing to fear, and at night, or rather during the\r\nhours of sleep, the boatswain and one of the superiors would keep\r\nguard near the cavity, and we might rest assured that no evil could\r\nbefall.\r\n\r\nThe 19th, 20th, and 21st of January were passed in working extra\r\nhard in the unshipping of the cargo and the dismantling of the\r\n_Halbrane_. We slung the lower masts by means of yards forming props.\r\nLater on, West would see to replacing the main and mizzen masts; in\r\nany case, we could do without them until we had reached the\r\nFalklands or some other winter port.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, we had set up a camp on the plateau of which I have\r\nspoken, not far from the _Halbrane_. Sufficient shelter against the\r\ninclemency of the weather, not unfrequent at this time of the year,\r\nwas to be found under tents, constructed of sails placed on spars\r\nand fastened down by pegs. The glass remained set fair; the wind was\r\nnor\'-east, the temperature having risen to 46 degrees (2\xc2\xb0 78\' C.).\r\n\r\nEndicott\'s kitchen was fitted up at the end of the plain, near a\r\nsteep projection by which we could climb to the very top of the berg.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to state that during these three days of hard work\r\nno fault was to be found with Hearne. The sealing-master knew he was\r\nbeing closely watched, and he was well aware that Captain Len Guy\r\nwould not spare him if he tried to get up insubordination amongst\r\nhis comrades. It was a pity that his bad instincts had induced him\r\nto play such a part, for his strength, skill, and cleverness made\r\nhim a very valuable man, and he had never proved more useful than\r\nunder these circumstances.\r\n\r\nWas he changed for the better? Did he understand that general good\r\nfeeling was necessary for the safety of all? I know not, but I had\r\nno confidence in him, neither had Hurliguerly!\r\n\r\nI need not dwell on the ardour with which the half-breed did the\r\nrough work, always first to begin and the last to leave off, doing\r\nas much as four men, and scarcely sleeping, only resting during\r\nmeals, which he took apart from the others. He had hardly spoken to\r\nme at all since the schooner had met with this terrible accident.\r\n\r\nWhat indeed could he say to me? Did I not know as well as he that it\r\nwould be necessary to renounce every hope of pursuing our intended\r\nvoyage?\r\n\r\nNow and again I noticed Martin Holt and the half-breed near each\r\nother while some difficult piece of work was in progress. Our\r\nsailing-master did not miss a chance of getting near Dirk Peters, who\r\nalways tried his best to escape from him, for reasons well known to\r\nme. And whenever I thought of the secret of the fate of the\r\nso-called Parker, Martin Holt\'s brother, which had been entrusted\r\nto me, that dreadful scene of the _Grampus_ filled me with horror. I\r\nwas certain that if this secret were made known the half-breed would\r\nbecome an object of terror. He would no longer be looked upon as the\r\nrescuer of the sailing-master; and the latter, learning that his\r\nbrother-- Luckily, Dirk Peters and myself were the only two\r\nacquainted with the fact.\r\n\r\nWhile the _Halbrane_ was being unloaded, Captain Len Guy and the mate\r\nwere considering how the vessel might be launched. They had to allow\r\nfor a drop of one hundred feet between the cavity in which the ship\r\nlay and the sea; this to be effected by means of an inclined bed\r\nhollowed in an oblique line along the west side of the iceberg, and\r\nto measure two or three hundred perches in length. So, while the\r\nfirst lot of men, commanded by the boatswain, was unloading the\r\nschooner, a second batch under West\'s orders began to cut the\r\ntrench between the blocks which covered the side of the floating\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nFloating? I know not why I use this expression, for the iceberg no\r\nlonger floated, but remained as motionless as an island. There was\r\nnothing to indicate that it would ever move again. Other icebergs\r\ndrifted along and passed us, going south-east, whilst ours, to use\r\nDirk Peters\' expression, was "lying to." Would its base be\r\nsufficiently undermined to allow it to detach itself? Perhaps some\r\nheavy mass of ice might strike it and set it free by the shock. No\r\none could predict such an event, and we had only the _Halbrane_ to\r\nrely upon for getting us out of these regions.\r\n\r\nWe were engaged in these various tasks until the 24th of January.\r\nThe atmosphere was clear, the temperature was even, and the\r\nthermometer had indeed gone up to two or three degrees above\r\nfreezing-point. The number of icebergs coming from the nor\'-west\r\nwas therefore increasing; there were now a hundred of them, and a\r\ncollision with any of these might have a most disastrous result.\r\nHardy, the caulker, hastened first of all to mend the hull; pegs had\r\nto be changed, bits of planking to be replaced, seams to be caulked.\r\nWe had everything that was necessary for this work, and we might\r\nrest assured that it would be performed in the best possible manner.\r\nIn the midst of the silence of these solitudes, the noise of the\r\nhammers striking nails into the side, and the sound of the mallet\r\nstuffing tow into the seams, had a startling effect. Sea-gulls, wild\r\nduck, albatross, and petrels flew in a circle round the top of the\r\nberg with a shrill screaming, and made a terrible uproar.\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself with West and the captain, our conversation\r\nnaturally turned on our situation and how to get out of it, and upon\r\nour chances of pulling through. The mate had good hopes that if no\r\naccident occurred the launching would be successfully accomplished.\r\nThe captain was more reserved on the subject, but at the thought\r\nthat he would have to renounce all hope of finding the survivors of\r\nthe _Jane_, his heart was ready to break.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Halbrane_ should again be ready for the sea, and when West\r\nshould inquire what course he was to steer, would Captain Len Guy\r\ndare to reply, "To the south"? No! for he would not be followed either\r\nby the new hands, or by the greater portion of the older members of\r\nthe crew. To continue our search in this direction, to go beyond the\r\npole, without being certain of reaching the Indian Ocean instead of\r\nthe Atlantic, would have been rashness of which no navigator would be\r\nguilty. If a continent bound the sea on this side, the schooner\r\nwould run the danger of being crushed by the mass of ice before it\r\ncould escape the southern winter.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, to attempt to persuade Captain Len Guy to\r\npursue the voyage would only be to court a certain refusal. It could\r\nnot even be proposed, now that necessity obliged us to return\r\nnorthwards, and not to delay a single day in this portion of the\r\nAntarctic regions. At any rate, though I resolved not again to speak\r\nof the matter to the captain, I lost no opportunity of sounding the\r\nboatswain. Often when he had finished his work, Hurliguerly would\r\ncome and join me; we would chat, and we would compare our\r\nrecollections of travel.\r\n\r\nOne day as we were seated on the summit of the iceberg, gazing\r\nfixedly on the deceptive horizon, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"Who could ever have imagined, Mr. Jeorling, when the _Halbrane_\r\nleft Kerguelen, that six and a half months afterwards she would be\r\nstuck on the side of an ice-mountain?"\r\n\r\n"A fact much more to be regretted," I replied, "because only\r\nfor that accident we should have attained our object, and we should\r\nhave begun our return journey."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to contradict," replied the boatswain, "but\r\nyou say we should have attained our object. Do you mean by that,\r\nthat we should have found our countrymen?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I can scarcely believe such would have been the case, Mr.\r\nJeorling, although this was the principal and perhaps even the only\r\nobject of our navigation in the polar seas."\r\n\r\n"The only one--yes--at the start," I insinuated. "But since\r\nthe half-breed\'s revelations about Arthur Pym--"\r\n\r\n"Ah! You are always harking back on that subject, like brave Dirk\r\nPeters."\r\n\r\n"Always, Hurliguerly; and only that a deplorable and unforeseen\r\naccident made us run aground--"\r\n\r\n"I leave you to your delusions, Mr. Jeorling, since you believe\r\nyou have run aground--"\r\n\r\n"Why? Is not this the case?"\r\n\r\n"In any case it is a wonderful running aground," replied the\r\nboatswain. "Instead of a good solid bottom, we have run aground in\r\nthe air."\r\n\r\n"Then I am right, Hurliguerly, in saying it is an unfortunate\r\nadventure."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunate, truly, but in my opinion we should take warning by\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"What warning?"\r\n\r\n"That it is not permitted to us to venture so far in these\r\nlatitudes, and I believe that the Creator forbids His creatures to\r\nclimb to the summit of the poles."\r\n\r\n"Notwithstanding that the summit of one pole is only sixty miles\r\naway from us now."\r\n\r\n"Granted, Mr. Jeorling, but these sixty miles are equal to\r\nthousands when we have no means of making them! And if the launch of\r\nthe schooner is not successful, here are we condemned to winter\r\nquarters which the polar bears themselves would hardly relish!"\r\n\r\nI replied only by a shake of my head, which Hurliguerly could not\r\nfail to understand.\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Mr. Jeorling, of what I think oftenest?"\r\n\r\n"What do you think of, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"Of the Kerguelens, whither we are certainly not travelling.\r\nTruly, in a bad season it was cold enough there! There is not much\r\ndifference between this archipelago and the islands situated on the\r\nedge of the Antarctic Sea! But there one is not far from the Cape,\r\nand if we want to warm our shins, no iceberg bars the way. Whereas\r\nhere it is the devil to weigh anchor, and one never knows if one\r\nshall find a clear course."\r\n\r\n"I repeat it, boatswain. If this last accident had not occurred,\r\neverything would have been over by this time, one way or another. We\r\nshould still have had more than six weeks to get out of these\r\nsouthern seas. It is seldom that a ship is so roughly treated as\r\nours has been, and I consider it real bad luck, after our having\r\nprofited by such fortunate circumstances--"\r\n\r\n"These circumstances are all over, Mr. Jeorling," exclaimed\r\nHurliguerly, "and I fear indeed--"\r\n\r\n"What--you also, boatswain--you whom I believed to be so\r\nconfident!"\r\n\r\n"Confidence, Mr. Jeorling, wears out like the ends of one\'s\r\ntrousers. What would you have me do? When I compare my lot to old\r\nAtkins, installed in his cosy inn; when I think of the Green\r\nCormorant, of the big parlours downstairs with the little tables\r\nround which friends sip whisky and gin, discussing the news of the\r\nday, while the stove makes more noise than the weathercock on the\r\nroof--oh, then the comparison is not in our favour, and in my\r\nopinion Mr. Atkins enjoys life better than I do."\r\n\r\n"You shall see them all again, boatswain--Atkins, the Green\r\nCormorant, and Kerguelen! For God\'s sake do not let yourself grow\r\ndownhearted! And if you, a sensible and courageous man, despair\r\nalready--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, if I were the only one it would not be half so bad as it\r\nis!"\r\n\r\n"The whole crew does not despair, surely?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--and no," replied Hurliguerly, "for I know some who are\r\nnot at all satisfied!"\r\n\r\n"Has Hearne begun his mischief again? Is he exciting his\r\ncompanions?"\r\n\r\n"Not openly at least, Mr. Jeorling, and since I have kept him\r\nunder my eye I have neither seen nor heard anything. Besides, he\r\nknows what awaits him if he budges. I believe I am not mistaken, the\r\nsly dog has changed his tactics. But what does not astonish me in\r\nhim, astonishes me in Martin Holt."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"That they seem to be on good terms with each other. See how\r\nHearne seeks out Martin Holt, talks to him frequently, and Holt does\r\nnot treat his overtures unfavourably.\'\'\r\n\r\n"Martin Holt is not one of those who would listen to Hearne\'s\r\nadvice, or follow it if he tried to provoke rebellion amongst the\r\ncrew."\r\n\r\n"No doubt, Mr. Jeorling. However, I don\'t fancy seeing them so\r\nmuch together. Hearne is a dangerous and unscrupulous individual,\r\nand most likely Martin Holt does not distrust him sufficiently."\r\n\r\n"He is wrong, boatswain."\r\n\r\n"And--wait a moment--do you know what they were talking about\r\nthe other day when I overheard a few scraps of their conversation?"\r\n\r\n"I could not possibly guess until you tell me, Hurliguerly."\r\n\r\n"Well, while they were conversing on the bridge of the _Halbrane_, I\r\nheard them talking about Dirk Peters, and Hearne was saying: \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nmust not owe a grudge to the half-breed, Master Holt, because he\r\nrefused to respond to your advances and accept your thanks! If he be\r\nonly a sort of brute, he possesses plenty of courage, and has showed\r\nit in getting you out of a bad corner at the risk of his life. And\r\nbesides, do not forget that he formed part of the crew of the\r\n_Grampus_, and your brother Ned, if I don\'t mistake--\'"\r\n\r\n"He said that, boatswain; he spoke of the _Grampus_?" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes--of the _Grampus_!"\r\n\r\n"And of Ned Holt?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely, Mr. Jeorling!"\r\n\r\n"And what answer did Martin Holt make?"\r\n\r\n"He replied: \xe2\x80\x98I don\'t even know under what circumstances my\r\nunfortunate brother perished. Was it during a revolt on board? Brave\r\nman that he was, he would not betray his captain, and perhaps he was\r\nmassacred.\'"\r\n\r\n"Did Hearne dwell on this, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he added: \xe2\x80\x98It is very sad for you, Master Holt! The\r\ncaptain of the _Grampus_, according to what I have been told, was\r\nabandoned, being placed in a small boat with one or two of his\r\nmen--and who knows if your brother was not along with him?\'"\r\n\r\n"And what next?"\r\n\r\n"Then, Mr. Jeorling, he added: \xe2\x80\x98Did it never occur to you to ask\r\nDirk Peters to enlighten you on the subject?\' \xe2\x80\x98Yes, once,\'\r\nreplied Martin Holt, \xe2\x80\x98I questioned the half-breed about it, and\r\nnever did I see a man so overcome. He replied in so low a voice that\r\nI could scarcely understand him, "I know not--I know not--"\r\nand he ran away with his face buried in his hands.\'"\r\n\r\n"Was that all you heard of the conversation, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"That was all, Mr. Jeorling, and I thought it so strange that I\r\nwished to inform you of it."\r\n\r\n"And what conclusion did you draw from it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, except that I look upon the sealing-master as a\r\nscoundrel of the deepest dye, perfectly capable of working in\r\nsecret for some evil purpose with which he would like to associate\r\nMartin Holt!"\r\n\r\nWhat did Hearne\'s new attitude mean? Why did he strive to gain\r\nMartin Holt, one of the best of the crew, as an ally? Why did he\r\nrecall the scenes of the _Grampus_? Did Hearne know more of this\r\nmatter of Dirk Peters and Ned Holt than the others; this secret of\r\nwhich the half-breed and I believed ourselves to be the sole\r\npossessors?\r\n\r\nThe doubt caused me serious uneasiness. However, I took good care\r\nnot to say anything of it to Dirk Peters. If he had for a moment\r\nsuspected that Hearne spoke of what happened on board the _Grampus_,\r\nif he had heard that the rascal (as Hurliguerly called him, and not\r\nwithout reason) constantly talked to Martin Holt about his brother,\r\nI really do not know what would have happened.\r\n\r\nIn short, whatever the intentions of Hearne might be, it was\r\ndreadful to think that our sailing-master, on whose fidelity Captain\r\nLen Guy ought to be able to count, was in conspiracy with him.\r\n\r\nThe sealing-master must have a strong motive for acting in this way.\r\nWhat it was I could not imagine. Although the crew seemed to have\r\nabandoned every thought of mutiny, a strict watch was kept,\r\nespecially on Hearne.\r\n\r\nBesides, the situation must soon change, at least so far as the\r\nschooner was concerned. Two days afterwards the work was finished.\r\nThe caulking operations were completed, and also the slide for\r\nlowering the vessel to the base of our floating mountain.\r\n\r\nJust now the upper portion of the ice had been slightly softened, so\r\nthat this last work did not entail much labour for pickaxe or\r\nspade. The course ran obliquely round the west side of the berg, so\r\nthat the incline should not be too great at any point. With cables\r\nproperly fixed, the launch, it seemed, might be effected without any\r\nmishap. I rather feared lest the melting of the ice should make the\r\ngliding less smooth at the lower part of the berg.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the cargo, masting, anchors, chains, &c., had not\r\nbeen put on board. The hull was quite heavy enough, and not easily\r\nmoved, so it was necessary to lighten it as much as possible. When\r\nthe schooner was again in its element, the loading could be\r\neffected in a few days.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 28th, the finishing touches were given. It\r\nwas necessary to put supports for the sides of the slide in some\r\nplaces where the ice had melted quickly. Then everyone was allowed\r\nto rest from 4 o\'clock p.m. The captain had double rations served\r\nout to all hands, and well they merited this extra supply of\r\nspirits; they had indeed worked hard during the week. I repeat that\r\nevery sign of mutiny had disappeared. The crew thought of nothing\r\nexcept this great operation of the launching. The _Halbrane_ in the\r\nsea would mean departure, it would also mean return! For Dirk Peters\r\nand me it would be the definite abandonment of Arthur Pym.\r\n\r\nThat night the temperature was the highest we had so far\r\nexperienced. The thermometer registered 53\xc2\xb0 (11\xc2\xb0 67\' C. below\r\nzero). So, although the sun was nearing the horizon, the ice was\r\nmelting, and thousands of small streams flowed in every direction.\r\nThe early birds awoke at four o\'clock, and I was one of their\r\nnumber. I had scarcely slept, and I fancy that Dirk Peters did not\r\nsleep much, haunted as he was by the sad thought of having to turn\r\nback!\r\n\r\nThe launch was to take place at ten o\'clock. Taking every possible\r\ndifficulty into account, and allowing for the minutest precautions,\r\nthe captain hoped that it would be completed before the close of the\r\nday. Everyone believed that by evening the schooner would be at the\r\nfoot of the berg.\r\n\r\nOf course we had all to lend a hand to this difficult task. To each\r\nman a special duty was assigned; some were employed to facilitate\r\nthe sliding with wooden rollers, if necessary; others to moderate\r\nthe speed of the hull, in case it became too great, by means of\r\nhawsers and cables.\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted at nine o\'clock in the tents. Our sailors were\r\nperfectly confident, and could not refrain from drinking "success\r\nto the event"; and although this was a little premature, we added\r\nour hurrahs to theirs. Success seemed very nearly assured, as the\r\ncaptain and the mate had worked out the matter so carefully and\r\nskilfully. At last we were about to leave our encampment and take up\r\nour stations (some of the sailors were there already), when cries of\r\namazement and fear were raised. What a frightful scene, and, short\r\nas it may have been, what an impression of terror it left on our\r\nminds!\r\n\r\nOne of the enormous blocks which formed the bank of the mud-bed\r\nwhere the _Halbrane_ lay, having become loose owing to the melting of\r\nits base, had slipped and was bounding over the others down the\r\nincline.\r\n\r\nIn another moment, the schooner, being no longer retained in\r\nposition, was swinging on this declivity.\r\n\r\nOn board, on deck, in front, there were two sailors, Rogers and\r\nGratian. In vain did the unfortunate men try to jump over the\r\nbulwarks, they had not time, and they were dragged away in this\r\ndreadful fall.\r\n\r\nYes! I saw it! I saw the schooner topple over, slide down first on\r\nits left side, crush one of the men who delayed too long about\r\njumping to one side, then bound from block to block, and finally\r\nfling itself into space.\r\n\r\nIn another moment the _Halbrane_, staved in, broken up, with gaping\r\nplanks and shattered ribs, had sunk, causing a tremendous jet of\r\nwater to spout up at the foot of the iceberg.\r\n\r\nHorrified! yes, indeed, we were horrified when the schooner, carried\r\noff as though by an avalanche, had disappeared in the abyss! Not a\r\nparticle of our _Halbrane_ remained, not even a wreck!\r\n\r\nA minute ago she was one hundred feet in the air, now she was five\r\nhundred in the depths of the sea! Yes, we were so stupefied that we\r\nwere unable to think of the dangers to come--our amazement was that\r\nof people who "cannot believe their eyes."\r\n\r\nProstration succeeded as a natural consequence. There was not a word\r\nspoken. We stood motionless, with our feet rooted to the icy soil.\r\nNo words could express the horror of our situation!\r\n\r\nAs for West, when the schooner had disappeared in the abyss, I saw\r\nbig tears fall from his eyes. The _Halbrane_ that he loved so much was\r\nnow an unknown quantity! Yes, our stout-hearted mate wept.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The _Halbrane_, staved in, broken up.]\r\n\r\nThree of our men had perished, and in what frightful fashion! I had\r\nseen Rogers and Gratian, two of our most faithful sailors, stretch\r\nout their hands in despair as they were knocked about by the\r\nrebounding of the schooner, and finally sink with her! The other man\r\nfrom the Falklands, an American, was crushed in its rush; his\r\nshapeless form lay in a pool of blood. Three new victims within the\r\nlast ten days had to be inscribed on the register of those who died\r\nduring this fatal voyage! Ah! fortune had favoured us up to the hour\r\nwhen the _Halbrane_ was snatched from her own element, but her hand\r\nwas now against us. And was not this last the worst blow--must it\r\nnot prove the stroke of death?\r\n\r\nThe silence was broken by a tumult of despairing voices, whose\r\ndespair was justified indeed by this irreparable misfortune!\r\n\r\nAnd I am sure that more than one thought it would have been better\r\nto have been on the _Halbrane_ as she rebounded off the side of the\r\niceberg!\r\n\r\nEverything would have been over then, as all was over with Rogers\r\nand Gratian! This foolish expedition would thus have come to a\r\nconclusion worthy of such rashness and imprudence!\r\n\r\nAt last, the instinct of self-preservation triumphed, and except\r\nHearne, who stood some distance off and affected silence, all the\r\nmen shouted: "To the boat! to the boat!"\r\n\r\nThese unfortunate fellows were out of their mind. Terror led them\r\nastray. They rushed towards the crag where our one boat (which could\r\nnot hold them all) had been sheltered during the unloading of the\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy and Jem West rushed after them. I joined them\r\nimmediately, followed by the boatswain. We were armed, and resolved\r\nto make use of our arms. We had to prevent these furious men from\r\nseizing the boat, which did not belong to a few, but to all!\r\n\r\n"Hallo, sailors!" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n"Hallo!" repeated West, "stop there, or we fire on the first\r\nwho goes a step farther!"\r\n\r\nBoth threatened the men with their pistols. The boatswain pointed\r\nhis gun at them. I held my rifle, ready to fire.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain! The frenzied men heard nothing, would not hear\r\nanything, and one of them fell, struck by the mate\'s bullet, just\r\nas he was crossing the last block. He was unable to catch on to the\r\nbank with his hands, and slipping on the frozen slope, he\r\ndisappeared in the abyss.\r\n\r\nWas this the beginning of a massacre? Would others let themselves be\r\nkilled at this place? Would the old hands side with the new-comers?\r\n\r\nAt that moment I remarked that Hardy, Martin Holt, Francis Bury, and\r\nStern hesitated about coming over to our side, while Hearne, still\r\nstanding motionless at some distance, gave no encouragement to the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nHowever, we could not allow them to become masters of the boat, to\r\nbring it down, to embark ten or twelve men, and to abandon us to our\r\ncertain fate on this iceberg. They had almost reached the boat,\r\nheedless of danger and deaf to threats, when a second report was\r\nheard, and one of the sailors fell, by a bullet from the\r\nboatswain\'s gun.\r\n\r\nOne American and one Fuegian less to be numbered amongst the\r\nsealing-master\'s partisans!\r\n\r\nThen, in front of the boat, a man appeared. It was Dirk Peters, who\r\nhad climbed the opposite slope.\r\n\r\nThe half-breed put one of his enormous hands on the stern and with\r\nthe other made a sign to the furious men to clear off. Dirk Peters\r\nbeing there, we no longer needed our arms, as he alone would suffice\r\nto protect the boat.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, as five or six of the sailors were advancing, he went up\r\nto them, caught hold of the nearest by the belt, lifted him up, and\r\nsent him flying ten paces off. The wretched man not being able to\r\ncatch hold of anything, would have rebounded into the sea had not\r\nHearne seized him.\r\n\r\nOwing to the half-breed\'s intervention the revolt was instantly\r\nquelled. Besides, we were coming up to the boat, and with us those of\r\nour men whose hesitation had not lasted long.\r\n\r\nNo matter. The others were still thirteen to our ten.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy made his appearance; anger shone in his eyes, and with\r\nhim was West, quite unmoved. Words failed the captain for some\r\nmoments, but his looks said what his tongue could not utter. At length,\r\nin a terrible voice, he said,--\r\n\r\n"I ought to treat you as evil-doers; however, I will only consider\r\nyou as madmen! The boat belongs to everybody. It is now our only\r\nmeans of salvation, and you wanted to steal it--to steal it like\r\ncowards! Listen attentively to what I say for the last time! This\r\nboat, belonging to the _Halbrane_, is now the _Halbrane_ herself! I am\r\nthe captain of it, and let him who disobeys me, beware!"\r\n\r\nWith these last words Captain Len Guy looked at Hearne, for whom\r\nthis warning was expressly meant. The sealing-master had not\r\nappeared in the last scene, not openly at least, but nobody doubted\r\nthat he had urged his comrades to make off with the boat, and that\r\nhe had every intention of doing the same again.\r\n\r\n"Now to the camp," said the captain, "and you, Dirk Peters,\r\nremain here!"\r\n\r\nThe half-breed\'s only reply was to nod his big head and betake\r\nhimself to his post.\r\n\r\nThe crew returned to the camp without the least hesitation. Some lay\r\ndown in their sleeping-places, others wandered about. Hearne neither\r\ntried to join them nor to go near Martin Holt.\r\n\r\nNow that the sailors were reduced to idleness, there was nothing to\r\ndo except to ponder on our critical situation, and invent some means\r\nof getting out of it.\r\n\r\nThe captain, the mate, and the boatswain formed a council, and I\r\ntook part in their deliberations.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy began by saying,--\r\n\r\n"We have protected our boat, and we shall continue to protect\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Until death," declared West.\r\n\r\n"Who knows," said I, "whether we shall not soon be forced to\r\nembark?"\r\n\r\n"In that case," replied the captain, "as all cannot fit into\r\nit, it will be necessary to make a selection. Lots shall determine\r\nwhich of us are to go, and I shall not ask to be treated differently\r\nfrom the others."\r\n\r\n"We have not come to that, luckily," replied the boatswain.\r\n"The iceberg is solid, and there is no fear of its melting before\r\nwinter."\r\n\r\n"No," assented West, "that is not to be feared. What it\r\nbehoves us to do is, while watching the boat, to keep an eye on the\r\nprovisions."\r\n\r\n"We are lucky," added Hurliguerly, "to have put our cargo in\r\nsafety. Poor, dear _Halbrane_. She will remain in these seas, like the\r\n_Jane_, her elder sister!"\r\n\r\nYes, without doubt, and I thought so for many reasons, the one\r\ndestroyed by the savages of Tsalal, the other by one of these\r\ncatastrophes that no human power can prevent.\r\n\r\n"You are right," replied the captain, "and we must prevent our\r\nmen from plundering. We are sure of enough provisions for one year,\r\nwithout counting what we may get by fishing."\r\n\r\n"And it is so much the more necessary, captain, to keep a close\r\nwatch, because I have seen some hovering about the spirit casks."\r\n\r\n"I will see to that," replied West.\r\n\r\n"But," I then asked, "had we not better prepare ourselves for\r\nthe fact that we may be compelled to winter on this iceberg."\r\n\r\n"May Heaven avert such a terrible probability," replied the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n"After all, if it were necessary, we could get through it, Mr.\r\nJeorling," said the boatswain. "We could hollow out sheltering-places\r\nin the ice, so as to be able to bear the extreme cold of the pole,\r\nand so long as we had sufficient to appease our hunger--"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the horrid recollection of the _Grampus_ came to my\r\nmind--the scenes in which Dirk Peters killed Ned Holt, the brother\r\nof our sailing-master. Should we ever be in such extremity?\r\n\r\nWould it not, before we proceed to set up winter quarters for seven\r\nor eight months, be better to leave the iceberg altogether, if such\r\na thing were possible?\r\n\r\nI called the attention of Captain Len Guy and West to this point.\r\n\r\nThis was a difficult question to answer, and a long silence preceded\r\nthe reply.\r\n\r\nAt last the captain said,--\r\n\r\n"Yes, that would be the best resolution to come to; and if our\r\nboat could hold us all, with the provisions necessary for a voyage\r\nthat might last three or four weeks, I would not hesitate to put to\r\nsea now and return towards the north."\r\n\r\nBut I made them observe that we should be obliged to direct our\r\ncourse contrary to wind and current; our schooner herself could\r\nhardly have succeeded in doing this. Whilst to continue towards the\r\nsouth--\r\n\r\n"Towards the south?" repeated the captain, who looked at me as\r\nthough he sought to read my thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" I answered. "If the iceberg had not been stopped\r\nin its passage, perhaps it would have drifted to some land in that\r\ndirection, and might not our boat accomplish what it would have\r\ndone?"\r\n\r\nThe captain, shaking his head, answered nothing. West also was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n"Eh! our iceberg will end by raising its anchor," replied\r\nHurliguerly. "It does not hold to the bottom, like the Falklands\r\nor the Kerguelens! So the safest course is to wait, as the boat\r\ncannot carry twenty-three, the number of our party."\r\n\r\nI dwelt upon the fact that it was not necessary for all twenty-three\r\nto embark. It would be sufficient, I said, for five or six of us to\r\nreconnoitre further south for twelve or fifteen miles.\r\n\r\n"South?" repeated Captain Len Guy.\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly, captain," I added. "You probably know what the\r\ngeographers frankly admit, that the antarctic regions are formed by\r\na capped continent."\r\n\r\n"Geographers know nothing, and can know nothing about it,"\r\nreplied West, coldly.\r\n\r\n"It is a pity," said I, "that as we are so near, we should not\r\nattempt to solve this question of a polar continent."\r\n\r\nI thought it better not to insist just at present.\r\n\r\nMoreover there would be danger in sending out our only boat on a\r\nvoyage of discovery, as the current might carry it too far, or it\r\nmight not find us again in the same place. And, indeed, if the\r\niceberg happened to get loose at the bottom, and to resume its\r\ninterrupted drift, what would become of the men in the boat?\r\n\r\nThe drawback was that the boat was too small to carry us all, with\r\nthe necessary provisions. Now, of the seniors, there remained ten\r\nmen, counting Dirk Peters; of the new men there were thirteen;\r\ntwenty-three in all. The largest number our boat could hold was from\r\neleven to twelve persons. Then eleven of us, indicated by lot, would\r\nhave to remain on this island of ice. And what would become of them?\r\n\r\nWith regard to this Hurliguerly made a sound observation.\r\n\r\n"After all," he said, "I don\'t know that those who would\r\nembark would be better off than those who remained! I am so doubtful\r\nof the result, that I would willingly give up my place to anyone who\r\nwanted it."\r\n\r\nPerhaps the boatswain was right. But in my own mind, when I asked\r\nthat the boat might be utilized, it was only for the purpose of\r\nreconnoitring the iceberg.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to arrange everything with a view to wintering\r\nout, even were our ice-mountain again to drift.\r\n\r\n"We may be sure that will be agreed to by our men," declared\r\nHurliguerly.\r\n\r\n"What is necessary must be done," replied the mate, "and\r\nto-day we must set to work."\r\n\r\nThat was a sad day on which we began our preparations.\r\n\r\nEndicott, the cook, was the only man who submitted without\r\nmurmuring. As a negro, who cares little about the future, shallow\r\nand frivolous like all his race, he resigned himself easily to his\r\nfate; and this is, perhaps, true philosophy. Besides, when it came\r\nto the question of cooking, it mattered very little to him whether\r\nit was here or there, so long as his stoves were set up somewhere.\r\n\r\nSo he said to his friend the mate, with his broad negro smile,--\r\n\r\n"Luckily my kitchen did not go off with the schooner, and you\r\nshall see, Hurliguerly, if I do not make up dishes just as good as\r\non board the _Halbrane_, so long as provisions don\'t grow scarce, of\r\ncourse--"\r\n\r\n"Well! they will not be wanting for some time to come," replied\r\nthe boatswain. "We need not fear hunger, but cold, such cold as\r\nwould reduce you to an icicle the minute you cease to warm your\r\nfeet--cold that makes your skin crack and your skull split! Even if\r\nwe had some hundreds of tons of coal--But, all things being well\r\ncalculated, there is only just what will do to boil this large\r\nkettle."\r\n\r\n"And that is sacred," cried Endicott; "touching is forbidden!\r\nThe kitchen before all."\r\n\r\n"And that is the reason why it never strikes you to pity yourself,\r\nyou old nigger! You can always make sure of keeping your feet warm\r\nat your oven!"\r\n\r\n"What would you have, boatswain? You are a first-rate cook, or you\r\nare not. When you are, you take advantage of it; but I will remember\r\nto keep you a little place before my stove."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good! that\'s good, Endicott! Each one shall have his\r\nturn! There is no privilege, even for a boatswain! On the whole, it\r\nis better not to have to fear famine! One can fight against the\r\ncold. We shall dig holes in the iceberg, and cuddle ourselves up\r\nthere. And why should we not have a general dwelling-room? We could\r\nmake a cave for ourselves with pickaxes! I have heard tell that ice\r\npreserves heat. Well, let it preserve ours, and that is all I ask of\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nThe hour had come for us to return to the camp and to seek our\r\nsleeping-places.\r\n\r\nDirk Peters alone refused to be relieved of his duty as watchman of\r\nthe boat, and nobody thought of disputing the post with him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy and West did not enter the tents until they had made\r\ncertain that Hearne and his companions had gone to their usual place\r\nof rest.\r\n\r\nI came back likewise and went to bed.\r\n\r\nI could not tell how long I had been sleeping, nor what time it was,\r\nwhen I found myself rolling on the ground after a violent shock.\r\n\r\nWhat could be happening? Was it another capsize of the iceberg?\r\n\r\nWe were all up in a second, then outside the tents in the full light\r\nof a night in the polar regions.\r\n\r\nA second floating mass of enormous size had just struck our iceberg,\r\nwhich had "hoisted the anchor" (as the sailors say) and was\r\ndrifting towards the south.\r\n\r\nAn unhoped-for change in the situation had taken place. What were to\r\nbe the consequences of our being no longer cast away at that place?\r\nThe current was now carrying us in the direction of the pole! The\r\nfirst feeling of joy inspired by this conviction was, however,\r\nsucceeded by all the terrors of the unknown! and what an unknown!\r\n\r\nDirk Peters only was entirely rejoiced that we had resumed the route\r\nwhich, he believed, would lead us to the discovery of traces of his\r\n"poor Pym"--far other ideas occupied the minds of his companions.\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy no longer entertained any hope of rescuing his\r\ncountrymen, and having reached the condition of despair, he was\r\nbound by his duty to take his crew back to the north, so as to clear\r\nthe antarctic circle while the season rendered it possible to do so.\r\nAnd we were being carried away towards the south!\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, we were all deeply impressed by the fearfulness of\r\nour position, which may be summed up in a few words. We were no\r\nlonger cast away, with a possible ship, but the tenants of a\r\nfloating iceberg, with no hope but that our monster tenement might\r\nencounter one of the whaling ships whose business in the deep waters\r\nlies between the Orkneys, New Georgia, and the Sandwich Islands. A\r\nquantity of things had been thrown into the ice by the collision\r\nwhich had set our iceberg afloat, but these were chiefly articles\r\nbelonging to the _Halbrane_. Owing to the precaution that had been\r\ntaken on the previous day, when the cargo was stowed away in the\r\nclefts, it had been only slightly damaged. What would have become of\r\nus, had all our reserves been swallowed up in that grim encounter?\r\n\r\nNow, the two icebergs formed but one, which was travelling south at\r\nthe rate of two miles an hour. At this rate, thirty hours would\r\nsuffice to bring us to the point of the axis at which the\r\nterrestrial meridians unite. Did the current which was carrying us\r\nalong pass on to the pole itself, or was there any land which might\r\narrest our progress? This was another question, and I discussed it\r\nwith the boatswain.\r\n\r\n"Nobody knows, Mr. Jeorling," was Hurliguerly\'s reply. "If\r\nthe current goes to the pole, we shall go there; and if it\r\ndoesn\'t, we shan\'t. An iceberg isn\'t a ship, and as it has\r\nneither sails nor helm, it goes as the drift takes it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, boatswain. And therefore I had the idea that if\r\ntwo or three of us were to embark in the boat--"\r\n\r\n"Ah! you still hold to your notion of the boat--"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, for, if there is land somewhere, is it not possible\r\nthat the people of the _Jane_--"\r\n\r\n"Have come upon it, Mr. Jeorling--at four thousand miles from\r\nTsalal Island."\r\n\r\n"Who knows, boatswain?"\r\n\r\n"That may be, but allow me to say that your argument will be\r\nreasonable when the land comes in sight, if it ever does so. Our\r\ncaptain will see what ought to be done, and he will remember that\r\ntime presses. We cannot delay in these waters, and, after all, the\r\none thing of real importance to us is to get out of the polar circle\r\nbefore the winter makes it impassable."\r\n\r\nThere was good sense in Hurliguerly\'s words; I could not deny the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nDuring that day the greater part of the cargo was placed in the\r\ninterior of a vast cave-like fissure in the side of the iceberg,\r\nwhere, even in case of a second collision, casks and barrels would\r\nbe in safety. Our men then assisted Endicott to set up his\r\ncooking-stove between two blocks, so that it was firmly fixed, and\r\nthey heaped up a great mass of coals close to it.\r\n\r\nNo murmurs, no recrimination disturbed these labours. It was evident\r\nthat silence was deliberately maintained. The crew obeyed the\r\ncaptain and West because they gave no orders but such as were of\r\nurgent necessity. But, afterwards, would these men allow the\r\nauthority of their leaders to be uncontested? How long would the\r\nrecruits from the Falklands, who were already exasperated by the\r\ndisasters of our enterprise, resist their desire to seize upon the\r\nboat and escape?\r\n\r\nI did not think they would make the attempt, however, so long as our\r\niceberg should continue to drift, for the boat could not outstrip\r\nits progress; but, if it were to run aground once more, to strike\r\nupon the coast of an island or a continent, what would not these\r\nunfortunate creatures do to escape the horrors of wintering under\r\nsuch conditions?\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, during the hour of rest allowed to the crew, I had\r\na second conversation with Dirk Peters. I had taken my customary\r\nseat at the top of the iceberg, and had occupied it for half an\r\nhour, being, as may be supposed, deep in thought, when I saw the\r\nhalf-breed coming quickly up the slope. We had exchanged hardly a\r\ndozen words since the iceberg had begun to move again. When Dirk\r\nPeters came up to me, he did not address me at first, and was so\r\nintent on his thoughts that I was not quite sure he saw me. At\r\nlength, he leaned back against an ice-block, and spoke:\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jeorling," he said, "you remember, in your cabin in the\r\n_Halbrane_, I told you the--the affair of the _Grampus_?"\r\n\r\nI remembered well.\r\n\r\n"I told you that Parker\'s name was not Parker, that it was Holt,\r\nand that he was Ned Holt\'s brother?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I was afraid; I got away from him."]\r\n\r\n"I know, Dirk Peters," I replied, "but why do you refer to\r\nthat sad story again?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Jeorling? Have not--have you never said anything about\r\nit to anybody?"\r\n\r\n"Not to anybody," I protested. "How could you suppose I should\r\nbe so ill-advised, so imprudent, as to divulge your secret, a secret\r\nwhich ought never to pass our lips--a dead secret?"\r\n\r\n"Dead, yes, dead! And yet, understand me, it seems to me that,\r\namong the crew, something is known."\r\n\r\nI instantly recalled to mind what the boatswain had told me\r\nconcerning a certain conversation in which he had overheard Hearne\r\nprompting Martin Holt to ask the half-breed what were the\r\ncircumstances of his brother\'s death on board the _Grampus_. Had a\r\nportion of the secret got out, or was this apprehension on the part\r\nof Dirk Peters purely imaginary?\r\n\r\n"Explain yourself," I said.\r\n\r\n"Understand me, Mr. Jeorling, I am a bad hand at explaining. Yes,\r\nyesterday--I have thought of nothing else since--Martin Holt took\r\nme aside, far from the others, and told me that he wished to speak\r\nto me--"\r\n\r\n"Of the _Grampus_?"\r\n\r\n"Of the _Grampus_--yes, and of his brother, Ned Holt. For the first\r\ntime he uttered that name before me--and yet we have sailed\r\ntogether for nearly three months."\r\n\r\nThe half-breed\'s voice was so changed that I could hardly hear him.\r\n\r\n"It seemed to me," he resumed, "that in Martin Holt\'s\r\nmind--no, I was not mistaken--there was something like a\r\nsuspicion."\r\n\r\n"But tell me what he said! Tell me exactly what he asked you. What\r\nis it?"\r\n\r\nI felt sure that the question put by Martin Holt, whatsoever its\r\nbearing, had been inspired by Hearne. Nevertheless, as I considered\r\nit well that the half-breed should know nothing of the sealing-master\'s\r\ndisquieting and inexplicable intervention in this tragic affair, I\r\ndecided upon concealing it from him.\r\n\r\n"He asked me," replied Dirk Peters, "did I not remember Ned\r\nHolt of the _Grampus_, and whether he had perished in the fight with\r\nthe mutineers or in the shipwreck; whether he was one of the men who\r\nhad been abandoned with Captain Barnard; in short, he asked me if I\r\ncould tell him how his brother died. Ah! how!"\r\n\r\nNo idea could be conveyed of the horror with which the half-breed\r\nuttered words which revealed a profound loathing of himself.\r\n\r\n"And what answer did you make to Martin Holt?"\r\n\r\n"None, none!"\r\n\r\n"You should have said that Ned Holt perished in the wreck of the\r\nbrig."\r\n\r\n"I could not--understand me--I could not. The two brothers are\r\nso like each other. In Martin Holt I seemed to see Ned Holt. I was\r\nafraid, I got away from him."\r\n\r\nThe half-breed drew himself up with a sudden movement, and I sat\r\nthinking, leaning my head on my hands. These tardy questions of\r\nHolt\'s respecting his brother were put, I had no doubt whatsoever,\r\nat the instigation of Hearne, but what was his motive, and was it at\r\nthe Falklands that he had discovered the secret of Dirk Peters? I\r\nhad not breathed a word on the subject to anyone. To the second\r\nquestion no answer suggested itself; the first involved a serious\r\nissue. Did the sealing-master merely desire to gratify his enmity\r\nagainst Dirk Peters, the only one of the Falkland sailors who had\r\nalways taken the side of Captain Len Guy, and who had prevented the\r\nseizure of the boat by Hearne and his companions? Did he hope, by\r\narousing the wrath and vengeance of Martin Holt, to detach the\r\nsailing-master from his allegiance and induce him to become an\r\naccomplice in Hearne\'s own designs? And, in fact, when it was a\r\nquestion of sailing the boat in these seas, had he not imperative\r\nneed of Martin Holt, one of the best seamen of the _Halbrane_? A man\r\nwho would succeed where Hearne and his companions would fail, if\r\nthey had only themselves to depend on?\r\n\r\nI became lost in this labyrinth of hypotheses, and it must be\r\nadmitted that its complications added largely to the troubles of an\r\nalready complicated position.\r\n\r\nWhen I raised my eyes, Dirk Peters had disappeared; he had said what\r\nhe came to say, and he now knew that I had not betrayed his\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThe customary precautions were taken for the night, no individual\r\nbeing allowed to remain outside the camp, with the exception of the\r\nhalf-breed, who was in charge of the boat.\r\n\r\nThe following day was the 31st of January. I pushed back the canvas\r\nof the tent, which I shared with Captain Len Guy and West\r\nrespectively, as each succeeded the other on release from the\r\nalternate "watch," very early, and experienced a severe\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nMist, everywhere! Nay, more than mist, a thick yellow,\r\nmouldy-smelling fog. And more than this again; the temperature had\r\nfallen sensibly: this was probably a forewarning of the austral\r\nwinter. The summit of our ice-mountain was lost in vapour, in a fog\r\nwhich would not resolve itself into rain, but would continue to\r\nmuffle up the horizon.\r\n\r\n"Bad luck!" said the boatswain, "for now if we were to pass by\r\nland we should not perceive it."\r\n\r\n"And our drift?"\r\n\r\n"More considerable than yesterday, Mr. Jeorling. The captain has\r\nsounded, and he makes the speed no less than between three and four\r\nmiles."\r\n\r\n"And what do you conclude from this?"\r\n\r\n"I conclude that we must be within a narrower sea, since the\r\ncurrent is so strong. I should not be surprised if we had land on\r\nboth sides of us within ten or fifteen miles."\r\n\r\n"This, then, would be a wide strait that cuts the antarctic\r\ncontinent?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Our captain is of that opinion."\r\n\r\n"And, holding that opinion, is he not going to make an attempt to\r\nreach one or other of the coasts of this strait?"\r\n\r\n"And how?"\r\n\r\n"With the boat."\r\n\r\n"Risk the boat in the midst of this fog!" exclaimed the\r\nboatswain, as he crossed his arms. "What are you thinking of, Mr.\r\nJeorling? Can we cast anchor to wait for it? And all the chances\r\nwould be that we should never see it again. Ah! if we only had the\r\n_Halbrane_!"\r\n\r\nBut there was no longer a _Halbrane_!\r\n\r\nIn spite of the difficulty of the ascent through the half-condensed\r\nvapour, I climbed up to the top of the iceberg, but when I had\r\ngained that eminence I strove in vain to pierce the impenetrable\r\ngrey mantle in which the waters were wrapped.\r\n\r\nI remained there, hustled by the north-east wind, which was\r\nbeginning to blow freshly and might perhaps rend the fog asunder.\r\nBut no, fresh vapours accumulated around our floating refuge, driven\r\nup by the immense ventilation of the open sea. Under the double\r\naction of the atmospheric and antarctic currents, we drifted more\r\nand more rapidly, and I perceived a sort of shudder pass throughout\r\nthe vast bulk of the iceberg.\r\n\r\nThen it was that I felt myself under the dominion of a sort of\r\nhallucination, one of those hallucinations which must have troubled\r\ntile mind of Arthur Pym. It seemed to me that I was losing myself in\r\nhis extraordinary personality; at last I was beholding all that he\r\nhad seen! Was not that impenetrable mist the curtain of vapours\r\nwhich he had seen in his delirium? I peered into it, seeking for\r\nthose luminous rays which had streaked the sky from east to west! I\r\nsought in its depths for that limitless cataract, rolling in silence\r\nfrom the height of some immense rampart lost in the vastness of the\r\nzenith! I sought for the awful white giant of the South Pole!\r\n\r\nAt length reason resumed her sway. This visionary madness,\r\nintoxicating while it lasted, passed off by degrees, and I descended\r\nthe slope to our camp.\r\n\r\nThe whole day passed without a change. The fog never once lifted to\r\ngive us a glimpse outside of its muffling folds, and if the iceberg,\r\nwhich had travelled forty miles since the previous day, had passed\r\nby the extremity of the axis of the earth, we should never know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nAMID THE MISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this was the sum of all our efforts, trials and disappointments!\r\nNot to speak of the destruction of the _Halbrane_, the expedition had\r\nalready cost nine lives. From thirty-two men who had embarked on the\r\nschooner, our number was reduced to twenty-three: how low was that\r\nfigure yet to fall?\r\n\r\nBetween the south pole and antarctic circle lay twenty degrees, and\r\nthose would have to be cleared in a month or six weeks at the most;\r\nif not, the iceberg barrier would be re-formed and closed-up. As for\r\nwintering in that part of the antarctic circle, not a man of us\r\ncould have survived it.\r\n\r\nBesides, we had lost all hope of rescuing the survivors of the _Jane_,\r\nand the sole desire of the crew was to escape as quickly as possible\r\nfrom the awful solitudes of the south. Our drift, which had been\r\nsouth, down to the pole, was now north, and, if that direction\r\nshould continue, perhaps we might be favoured with such good\r\nfortune as would make up for all the evil that had befallen us! In\r\nany case there was nothing for it but, in familiar phrase, "to let\r\nourselves go."\r\n\r\nThe mist did not lift during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of February, and\r\nit would have been difficult to make out the rate of progress of our\r\niceberg since it had passed the pole. Captain Len Guy, however, and\r\nWest, considered themselves safe in reckoning it at two hundred and\r\nfifty miles.\r\n\r\nThe current did not seem to have diminished in speed or changed its\r\ncourse. It was now beyond a doubt that we were moving between the\r\ntwo halves of a continent, one on the east, the other on the west,\r\nwhich formed the vast antarctic region. And I thought it was a matter\r\nof great regret that we could not get aground on one or the other\r\nside of this vast strait, whose surface would presently be\r\nsolidified by the coming of winter.\r\n\r\nWhen I expressed this sentiment to Captain Len Guy, he made me the\r\nonly logical answer:\r\n\r\n"What would you have, Mr. Jeorling? We are powerless. There is\r\nnothing to be done, and the persistent fog is the worst part of our\r\nill luck. I no longer know where we are. It is impossible to take an\r\nobservation, and this befalls us just as the sun is about to\r\ndisappear for long months."\r\n\r\n"Let me come back to the question of the boat," said I, "for\r\nthe last time. Could we not, with the boat--"\r\n\r\n"Go on a discovery cruise? Can you think of such a thing? That\r\nwould be an imprudence I would not commit, even though the crew\r\nwould allow me."\r\n\r\nI was on the point of exclaiming: "And what if your brother and\r\nyour countrymen have found refuge on some spot of the land that\r\nundoubtedly lies about us?"\r\n\r\nBut I restrained myself. Of what avail was it to reawaken our\r\ncaptain\'s grief? He, too, must have contemplated this eventuality,\r\nand he had not renounced his purpose of further search without being\r\nfully convinced of the folly of a last attempt.\r\n\r\nDuring those three days of fog I had not caught sight of Dirk\r\nPeters, or rather he had made no attempt to approach, but had\r\nremained inflexibly at his post by the boat. Martin Holt\'s\r\nquestions respecting his brother Ned seemed to indicate that his\r\nsecret was known--at least in part, and the half-breed held himself\r\nmore than ever aloof, sleeping while the others watched, and\r\nwatching in their time of sleep. I even wondered whether he\r\nregretted having confided in me, and fancied that he had aroused my\r\nrepugnance by his sad story. If so, he was mistaken; I deeply pitied\r\nthe poor half-breed.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the melancholy monotony of the hours which we\r\npassed in the midst of a fog so thick that the wind could not lift\r\nits curtain. The position of the iceberg could not be ascertained.\r\nIt went with the current at a like speed, and had it been motionless\r\nthere would have been no appreciable difference for us, for the wind\r\nhad fallen--at least, so we supposed--and not a breath was\r\nstirring. The flame of a torch held up in the air did not flicker.\r\nThe silence of space was broken only by the clangour of the\r\nsea-birds, which came in muffled croaking tones through the stifling\r\natmosphere of vapour. Petrels and albatross swept the top of the\r\niceberg, where they kept a useless watch in their flight. In what\r\ndirection were those swift-winged creatures--perhaps already driven\r\ntowards the confines of the arctic region at the approach of\r\nwinter--bound? We could not tell. One day, the boatswain, who was\r\ndetermined to solve this question if possible, having mounted to the\r\nextreme top, not without risk of breaking his neck, came into such\r\nviolent contact with a _quebranta huesos_--a sort of gigantic petrel\r\nmeasuring twelve feet with spread wings--that he was flung on his\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"Curse the bird!" he said on his return to the camp, addressing\r\nthe observation to me. "I have had a narrow escape! A thump, and\r\ndown I went, sprawling. I saved myself I don\'t know how, for I was\r\nall but over the side. Those ice ledges, you know, slip through\r\none\'s fingers like water. I called out to the bird, \xe2\x80\x98Can\'t you\r\neven look before you, you fool?\' But what was the good of that?\r\nThe big blunderer did not even beg my pardon!"\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the same day our ears were assailed by a hideous\r\nbraying from below. Hurliguerly remarked that as there were no asses\r\nto treat us to the concert, it must be given by penguins. Hitherto\r\nthese countless dwellers in the polar regions had not thought proper\r\nto accompany us on our moving island; we had not seen even one,\r\neither at the foot of the iceberg or on the drifting packs.\r\nThere could be no doubt that they were there in thousands, for the\r\nmusic was unmistakably that of a multitude of performers. Now those\r\nbirds frequent by choice the edges of the coasts of islands and\r\ncontinents in high latitudes, or the ice-fields in their\r\nneighbourhood. Was not their presence an indication that land was\r\nnear?\r\n\r\nI asked Captain Len Guy what he thought of the presence of these\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n"I think what you think, Mr. Jeorling," he replied. "Since we\r\nhave been drifting, none of them have taken refuge on the iceberg,\r\nand here they are now in crowds, if we may judge by their deafening\r\ncries. From whence do they come? No doubt from land, which is\r\nprobably near."\r\n\r\n"Is this West\'s opinion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Jeorling, and you know he is not given to vain\r\nimaginations."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"And then another thing has struck both him and me, which has\r\napparently escaped your attention. It is that the braying of the\r\npenguins is mingled with a sound like the lowing of cattle. Listen\r\nand you will readily distinguish it."\r\n\r\nI listened, and, sure enough, the orchestra was more full than I had\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\n"I hear the lowing plainly," I said; "there are, then, seals\r\nand walrus also in the sea at the base."\r\n\r\n"That is certain, Mr. Jeorling, and I conclude from the fact that\r\nthose animals--both birds and mammals--very rare since we left\r\nTsalal Island, frequent the waters into which the currents have\r\ncarried us."\r\n\r\n"Of course, captain, of course. Oh! what a misfortune it is that\r\nwe should be surrounded by this impenetrable fog!"\r\n\r\n"Which prevents us from even getting down to the base of the\r\niceberg! There, no doubt, we should discover whether there are\r\nseaweed drifts around us; if that be so, it would be another sign."\r\n\r\n"Why not try, captain?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, Mr. Jeorling, that might lead to falls, and I will not\r\npermit anybody to leave the camp. If land be there, I imagine our\r\niceberg will strike it before long."\r\n\r\n"And if it does not?"\r\n\r\n"If it does not, how are we to make it?"\r\n\r\nI thought to myself that the boat might very well be used in the\r\nlatter case. But Captain Len Guy preferred to wait, and perhaps this\r\nwas the wiser course under our circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\'clock that evening the half-condensed mist was so\r\ncompact that it was difficult to walk through it. The composition of\r\nthe air seemed to be changed, as though it were passing into a solid\r\nstate. It was not possible to discern whether the fog had any effect\r\nupon the compass. I knew the matter had been studied by\r\nmeteorologists, and that they believe they may safely affirm that\r\nthe needle is not affected by this condition of the atmosphere. I\r\nwill add here that since we had left the South Pole behind no\r\nconfidence could be placed in the indications of the compass; it had\r\ngone wild at the approach to the magnetic pole, to which we were no\r\ndoubt on the way. Nothing could be known, therefore, concerning the\r\ncourse of the iceberg.\r\n\r\nThe sun did not set quite below the horizon at this period, yet the\r\nwaters were wrapped in tolerably deep darkness at nine o\'clock in\r\nthe evening, when the muster of the crew took place.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion each man as usual answered to his name except Dirk\r\nPeters.\r\n\r\nThe call was repeated in the loudest of Hurliguerly\'s stentorian\r\ntones. No reply.\r\n\r\n"Has nobody seen Dirk Peters during the day?" inquired the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n"Nobody," answered the boatswain.\r\n\r\n"Can anything have happened to him?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid," cried the boatswain. "Dirk Peters is in\r\nhis element, and as much at his ease in the fog as a polar bear. He\r\nhas got out of one bad scrape; he will get out of a second!"\r\n\r\nI let Hurliguerly have his say, knowing well why the half-breed kept\r\nout of the way.\r\n\r\nThat night none of us, I am sure, could sleep. We were smothered in\r\nthe tents, for lack of oxygen. And we were all more or less under\r\nthe influence of a strange sort of presentiment, as though our fate\r\nwere about to change, for better or worse, if indeed it could be\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nThe night wore on without any alarm, and at six o\'clock in the\r\nmorning each of us came out to breathe a more wholesome air.\r\n\r\nThe state of things was unchanged, the density of the fog was\r\nextraordinary. It was, however, found that the barometer had risen,\r\ntoo quickly, it is true, for the rise to be serious. Presently other\r\nsigns of change became evident. The wind, which was growing\r\ncolder--a south wind since we had passed beyond the south\r\npole--began to blow a full gale, and the noises from below were\r\nheard more distinctly through the space swept by the atmospheric\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock the iceberg doffed its cap of vapour quite\r\nsuddenly, producing an indescribable transformation scene which no\r\nfairy\'s wand could have accomplished in less time or with greater\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, the sky was clear to the extreme verge of the\r\nhorizon, and the sea reappeared, illumined by the oblique rays of\r\nthe sun, which now rose only a few degrees above it. A rolling swell\r\nof the waves bathed the base of our iceberg in white foam, as it\r\ndrifted, together with a great multitude of floating mountains under\r\nthe double action of wind and current, on a course inclining to the\r\nnor\'-nor\'-east.\r\n\r\n"Land!"\r\n\r\nThis cry came from the summit of the moving mountain, and Dirk\r\nPeters was revealed to our sight, standing on the outermost block,\r\nhis hand stretched towards the north.\r\n\r\nThe half-breed was not mistaken. The land this time--yes!--it was\r\nland! Its distant heights, of a blackish hue, rose within three or\r\nfour miles of us.\r\n\r\n  86\xc2\xb0 12\' south latitude.\r\n  114\xc2\xb0 17\' east longitude.\r\n\r\nThe iceberg was nearly four degrees beyond the antarctic pole, and\r\nfrom the western longitudes that our schooner had followed tracing\r\nthe course of the _Jane_, we had passed into the eastern longitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nIN CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little after noon, the iceberg was within a mile of the land.\r\n\r\nAfter their dinner, the crew climbed up to the topmost block, on\r\nwhich Dirk Peters was stationed. On our approach the half-breed\r\ndescended the opposite slope, and when I reached the top he was no\r\nlonger to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe land on the north evidently formed a continent or island of\r\nconsiderable extent. On the west there was a sharply projecting\r\ncape, surmounted by a sloping height which resembled an enormous\r\nseal\'s head on the side view; then beyond that was a wide stretch\r\nof sea. On the east the land was prolonged out of sight.\r\n\r\nEach one of us took in the position. It depended on the\r\ncurrent whether it would carry the iceberg into an eddy which might\r\ndrive it on the coast, or continue to drift it towards the north.\r\n\r\nWhich was the more admissible hypothesis?\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy, West, Hurliguerly, and I talked over the matter,\r\nwhile the crew discussed it among themselves. Finally, it was agreed\r\nthat the current tended rather to carry the iceberg towards the\r\nnorthern point of land.\r\n\r\n"After all," said Captain Len Guy, "if it is habitable during\r\nthe months of the summer season, it does not look like being\r\ninhabited, since we cannot descry a human being on the shore."\r\n\r\n"Let us bear in mind, captain," said I, "that the iceberg is\r\nnot calculated to attract attention as the _Halbrane_ would have\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"Evidently, Mr. Jeorling; and the natives, if there were any,\r\nwould have been collected on the beach to see the _Halbrane_\r\nalready."\r\n\r\n"We must not conclude, captain, because we do not see any\r\nnatives--"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, Mr. Jeorling; but you will agree with me that the\r\naspect of this land is very unlike that of Tsalal Island when the\r\n_Jane_ reached it; there is nothing here but desolation and\r\nbarrenness."\r\n\r\n"I acknowledge that--barrenness and desolation, that is all.\r\nNevertheless, I want to ask you whether it is your intention to go\r\nashore, captain?"\r\n\r\n"With the boat?"\r\n\r\n"With the boat, should the current carry our iceberg away from the\r\nland."\r\n\r\n"We have not an hour to lose, Mr. Jeorling, and the delay of a few\r\nhours might condemn us to a cruel winter stay, if we arrived too\r\nlate at the iceberg barrier."\r\n\r\n"And, considering the distance, we are not too soon," observed\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n"I grant it," I replied, still persisting. "But, to leave this\r\nland behind us without ever having set foot on it, without having\r\nmade sure that it does not preserve the traces of an encampment, if\r\nyour brother, captain--his companions--"\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy shook his head. How could the castaways have\r\nsupported life in this desolate region for several months?\r\n\r\nBesides, the British flag was hoisted on the summit of the iceberg,\r\nand William Guy would have recognized it and come down to the shore\r\nhad he been living.\r\n\r\nNo one. No one.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, West, who had been observing certain points of\r\napproach, said,--\r\n\r\n"Let us wait a little before we come to a decision. In less than\r\nan hour we shall be able to decide. Our speed is slackening, it\r\nseems to me, and it is possible that an eddy may bring us back\r\nobliquely to the coast."\r\n\r\n"That is my opinion too," said the boatswain, "and if our\r\nfloating machine is not stationary, it is nearly so. It seems to be\r\nturning round."\r\n\r\nWest and Hurliguerly were not mistaken. For some reason or other the\r\niceberg was getting out of the course which it had followed\r\ncontinuously. A giratory movement had succeeded to that of drifting,\r\nowing to the action of an eddy which set towards the coast.\r\n\r\nBesides, several ice-mountains, in front of us, had just run aground\r\non the edge of the shore. It was, then, useless to discuss whether\r\nwe should take to the boat or not. According as we approached, the\r\ndesolation of the land became more and more apparent, and the\r\nprospect of enduring six months\' wintering there would have\r\nappalled the stoutest hearts.\r\n\r\nAt five in the afternoon, the iceberg plunged into a deep rift in\r\nthe coast ending in a long point on the right, and there stuck fast.\r\n\r\n"On shore! On shore!" burst from every man, like a single\r\nexclamation, and the men were already hurrying down the slope of the\r\niceberg, when West commanded:\r\n\r\n"Wait for orders!"\r\n\r\nSome hesitation was shown--especially on the part of Hearne and\r\nseveral of his comrades. Then the instinct of discipline prevailed,\r\nand finally the whole crew ranged themselves around Captain Len Guy.\r\nIt was not necessary to lower the boat, the iceberg being in contact\r\nwith the point.\r\n\r\nThe captain, the boatswain, and myself, preceding the others, were\r\nthe first to quit the camp; ours were the first human feet to tread\r\nthis virgin and volcanic soil.\r\n\r\nWe walked for twenty minutes on rough land, strewn with rocks of\r\nigneous origin, solidified lava, dusty slag, and grey ashes, but\r\nwithout enough clay to grow even the hardiest plants.\r\n\r\nWith some risk and difficulty, Captain Len Guy, the boatswain, and I\r\nsucceeded in climbing the hill; this exploit occupied a whole hour.\r\nAlthough evening had now come, it brought no darkness in its train.\r\nFrom the top of the hill we could see over an extent of from thirty\r\nto forty miles, and this was what we saw.\r\n\r\nBehind us lay the open sea, laden with floating masses; a great\r\nnumber of these had recently heaped themselves up against the beach\r\nand rendered it almost inaccessible.\r\n\r\nOn the west was a strip of hilly land, which extended beyond our\r\nsight, and was washed on its east side by a boundless sea. It was\r\nevident that we had been carried by the drift through a strait.\r\n\r\nAh! if we had only had our _Halbrane_! But our sole possession was a\r\nfrail craft barely capable of containing a dozen men, and we were\r\ntwenty-three!\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to go down to the shore again, to carry\r\nthe tents to the beach, and take measures in view of a winter\r\nsojourn under the terrible conditions imposed upon us by\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nOn our return to the coast the boatswain discovered several caverns\r\nin the granitic cliffs, sufficiently spacious to house us all and\r\nafford storage for the cargo of the _Halbrane_. Whatever might be our\r\nultimate decision, we could not do better than place our material\r\nand instal ourselves in this opportune shelter.\r\n\r\nAfter we had reascended the slopes of the iceberg and reached our\r\ncamp, Captain Len Guy had the men mustered. The only missing man was\r\nDirk Peters, who had decidedly isolated himself from the crew. There\r\nwas nothing to fear from him, however; he would be with the faithful\r\nagainst the mutinous, and under all circumstances we might count upon\r\nhim. When the circle had been formed, Captain Len Guy spoke, without\r\nallowing any sign of discouragement to appear, and explained the\r\nposition with the utmost frankness and lucidity, stating in the\r\nfirst place that it was absolutely necessary to lower the cargo to\r\nthe coast and stow it away in one of the caverns. Concerning the\r\nvital question of food, he stated that the supply of flour,\r\npreserved meat, and dried vegetables would suffice for the winter,\r\nhowever prolonged, and on that of fuel he was satisfied that we\r\nshould not want for coal, provided it was not wasted; and it would\r\nbe possible to economize it, as the hibernating waifs might brave\r\nthe cold of the polar zone under a covering of snow and a roof of\r\nice.\r\n\r\nWas the captain\'s tone of security feigned? I did not think so,\r\nespecially as West approved of what he said.\r\n\r\nA third question raised by Hearne remained, and was well calculated\r\nto arouse jealousy and anger among the crew. It was the question of\r\nthe use to be made of the only craft remaining to us. Ought the boat\r\nto be kept for the needs of our hibernation, or used to enable us to\r\nreturn to the iceberg barrier?\r\n\r\nCaptain Len Guy would not pronounce upon this; he desired to\r\npostpone the decision for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. The\r\nboat, carrying the provisions necessary for such a voyage, could not\r\naccommodate more than eleven or, at the outside, twelve men. If the\r\ndeparture of the boat were agreed to, then its passengers must be\r\nselected by lot. The captain proceeded to state that neither West,\r\nthe boatswain, I, nor he would claim any privilege, but would submit\r\nto the fortune of the lot with all the others. Both Martin Holt and\r\nHardy were perfectly capable of taking the boat to the fishing-grounds,\r\nwhere the whalers would still be found.\r\n\r\nThen, those to whom the lot should fall were not to forget their\r\ncomrades, left to winter on the eighty-sixth parallel, and were to\r\nsend a ship to take them off at the return of summer.\r\n\r\nAll this was said in a tone as calm as it was firm. I must do\r\nCaptain Len Guy the justice to say that he rose to the occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded--without any interruption even from\r\nHearne--no one made a remark. There was, indeed, none to be made,\r\nsince, in the given case, lots were to be drawn under conditions of\r\nperfect equality.\r\n\r\nThe hour of rest having arrived, each man entered the camp, partook\r\nof the supper prepared by Endicott, and went to sleep for the last\r\ntime under the tents.\r\n\r\nDirk Peters had not reappeared, and I sought for him in vain.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 7th of February, everybody set to work\r\nearly with a will. The boat was let down with all due precaution to\r\nthe base of the iceberg, and drawn up by the men on a little sandy\r\nbeach out of reach of the water. It was in perfectly good condition,\r\nand thoroughly serviceable.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain then set to work on the former contents of the\r\n_Halbrane_, furniture, bedding, sails, clothing, instruments, and\r\nutensils. Stowed away in a cabin, these things would no longer be\r\nexposed to the knocking about and damage of the iceberg. The cases\r\ncontaining preserved food and the casks of spirits were rapidly\r\ncarried ashore.\r\n\r\nI worked with the captain and West at this onerous task, and Dirk\r\nPeters also turned up and lent the valuable assistance of his great\r\nstrength, but he did not utter a word to anyone.\r\n\r\nOur occupation continued on the 8th, 9th, and 10th February, and our\r\ntask was finished in the afternoon of the 10th. The cargo was safely\r\nstowed in the interior of a large grotto, with access to it by a\r\nnarrow opening. We were to inhabit the adjoining grotto, and\r\nEndicott set up his kitchen in the latter, on the advice of the\r\nboatswain. Thus we should profit by the heat of the stove, which was\r\nto cook our food and warm the cavern during the long days, or rather\r\nthe long nights of the austral winter.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of housing and storing, I observed nothing to\r\narouse suspicion in the bearing of Hearne and the Falklands men.\r\nNevertheless, the half-breed was kept on guard at the boat, which\r\nmight easily have been seized upon the beach.\r\n\r\nHurliguerly, who observed his comrades closely, appeared less\r\nanxious.\r\n\r\nOn that same evening Captain Len Guy, having reassembled his people,\r\nstated that the question should be discussed on the morrow, adding\r\nthat, if it were decided in the affirmative, lots should be drawn\r\nimmediately. No reply was made.\r\n\r\nIt was late, and half dark outside, for at this date the sun was on\r\nthe edge of the horizon, and would very soon disappear below it.\r\n\r\nI had been asleep for some hours when I was awakened by a great\r\nshouting at a short distance. I sprang up instantly and darted out\r\nof the cavern, simultaneously with the captain and West, who had\r\nalso been suddenly aroused from sleep.\r\n\r\n"The boat! the boat!" cried West.\r\n\r\nThe boat was no longer in its place--that place so jealously\r\nguarded by Dirk Peters.\r\n\r\nAfter they had pushed the boat into the sea, three men had got into\r\nit with bales and casks, while ten others strove to control the\r\nhalf-breed.\r\n\r\nHearne was there, and Martin Holt also; the latter, it seemed to me,\r\nwas not interfering.\r\n\r\nThese wretches, then, intended to depart before the lots were drawn;\r\nthey meant to forsake us. They had succeeded in surprising Dirk\r\nPeters, and they would have killed him, had he not fought hard for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this mutiny, knowing our inferiority of numbers, and\r\nnot knowing whether he might count on all the old crew, Captain Len\r\nGuy re-entered the cavern with West in order to procure arms. Hearne\r\nand his accomplices were armed.\r\n\r\nI was about to follow them when the following words arrested my\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nThe half-breed, overpowered by numbers, had been knocked down, and\r\nat this moment Martin Holt, in gratitude to the man who saved his\r\nlife, was rushing to his aid, but Hearne called out to him,--\r\n\r\n"Leave the fellow alone, and come with us!"\r\n\r\nMartin Holt hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Yes, leave him alone, I say; leave Dirk Peters, the assassin of\r\nyour brother, alone."\r\n\r\n"The assassin of my brother!"\r\n\r\n"Your brother, killed on board the _Grampus_--"\r\n\r\n"Killed! by Dirk Peters?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! Killed and eaten--eaten--eaten!" repeated Hearne, who\r\npronounced the hateful words with a kind of howl.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at a sign from Hearne, two of his comrades seized Martin\r\nHolt and dragged him into the boat. Hearne was instantly followed by\r\nall those whom he had induced to join in this criminal deed.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Dirk Peters rose from the ground, and sprang upon one\r\nof the Falklands men as he was in the act of stepping on the\r\nplatform of the boat, lifted him up bodily, hurled him round his\r\nhead and dashed his brains out against a rock.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the half-breed fell, shot in the shoulder by a bullet\r\nfrom Hearne\'s pistol, and the boat was pushed off.\r\n\r\nThen Captain Len Guy and West came out of the cavern--the whole\r\nscene had passed in less than a minute--and ran down to the point,\r\nwhich they reached together with the boatswain, Hardy, Francis, and\r\nStern.\r\n\r\nThe boat, which was drawn by the current, was already some distance\r\noff, and the tide was falling rapidly.\r\n\r\nWest shouldered his gun and fired; a sailor dropped into the bottom\r\nof the boat. A second shot, fired by Captain Len Guy, grazed\r\nHearne\'s breast, and the ball was lost among the ice-blocks at the\r\nmoment when the boat disappeared behind the iceberg.\r\n\r\nThe only thing for us to do was to cross to the other side of the\r\npoint. The current would carry the wretches thither, no doubt,\r\nbefore it bore them northward. If they passed within range, and if\r\na second shot should hit Hearne, either killing or wounding him, his\r\ncompanions might perhaps decide on coming back to us.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour elapsed. When the boat appeared at the other\r\nside of the point, it was so far off that our bullets could not\r\nreach it. Hearne had already had the sail set, and the boat,\r\nimpelled by wind and current jointly, was soon no more than a white\r\nspeck on the face of the waters, and speedily disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nFOUND AT LAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of our wintering on the land whereon we had been thrown\r\nwas settled for us. But, after all, the situation was not changed\r\nfor those among the nine (now only remaining of the twenty-three)\r\nwho should not have drawn the lot of departure. Who could speculate\r\nupon the chances of the whole nine? Might not all of them have drawn\r\nthe lot of "stay"? And, when every chance was fully weighed, was\r\nthat of those who had left us the best? To this question there could\r\nbe no answer.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat had disappeared, Captain Len Guy and his companions\r\nretraced their steps towards the cavern in which we must live for\r\nall the time during which we could not go out, in the dread darkness\r\nof the antarctic winter. My first thought was of Dirk Peters, who,\r\nbeing wounded, could not follow us when we hurried to the other side\r\nof the point.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the cavern I failed to find the half-breed. Was he\r\nseverely wounded? Should we have to mourn the death of this man who\r\nwas as faithful to us as to his "poor Pym"?\r\n\r\n"Let us search for him, Mr. Jeorling!" cried the boatswain.\r\n\r\n"We will go together," said the captain. "Dirk Peters would never\r\nhave forsaken us, and we will not forsake him."\r\n\r\n"Would he come back," said I, "now that what he thought was\r\nknown to him and me only has come out?"\r\n\r\nI informed my companions of the reason why the name of Ned Holt had\r\nbeen changed to that of Parker in Arthur Pym\'s narrative, and of\r\nthe circumstances under which the half-breed had apprised me of the\r\nfact. At the same time I urged every consideration that might\r\nexculpate him, dwelling in particular upon the point that if the lot\r\nhad fallen to Dirk Peters, he would have been the victim of the\r\nothers\' hunger.\r\n\r\n"Dirk Peters confided this secret to you only?" inquired Captain\r\nLen Guy.\r\n\r\n"To me only, captain."\r\n\r\n"And you have kept it?"\r\n\r\n"Absolutely."\r\n\r\n"Then I cannot understand how it came to the knowledge of\r\nHearne."\r\n\r\n"At first," I replied, "I thought Hearne might have talked in\r\nhis sleep, and that it was by chance Martin Holt learned the secret.\r\nAfter reflection, however, I recalled to mind that when the\r\nhalf-breed related the scene on the _Grampus_ to me, he was in my\r\ncabin, and the side sash was raised. I have reason to think that the\r\nman at the wheel overheard our conversation. Now that man was\r\nHearne, who, in order to hear it more clearly, let go the wheel, so\r\nthat the _Halbrane_ lurched--"\r\n\r\n"I remember," said West. "I questioned the fellow sharply, and\r\nsent him down into the hold."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, captain," I resumed, "it was from that day that\r\nHearne made up to Martin Holt. Hurliguerly called my attention to\r\nthe fact."\r\n\r\n"Of course he did," said the boatswain, "for Hearne, not being\r\ncapable of managing the boat which he intended to seize, required a\r\nmaster-hand like Holt."\r\n\r\n"And so," I said, "he kept on urging Holt to question the\r\nhalf-breed concerning his brother\'s fate, and you know how Holt\r\ncame at last to learn the fearful truth. Martin Holt seemed to be\r\nstupefied by the revelation. The others dragged him away, and now he\r\nis with them!" We were all agreed that things had happened as I\r\nsupposed, and now the question was, did Dirk Peters, in his present\r\nstate of mind, mean to absent himself? Would he consent to resume\r\nhis place among us?\r\n\r\nWe all left the cavern, and after an hour\'s search we came in\r\nsight of Dirk Peters, whose first impulse was to escape from us. At\r\nlength, however, Hurliguerly and Francis came up with him. He stood\r\nstill and made no resistance. I advanced and spoke to him, the\r\nothers did the same. Captain Len Guy offered him his hand, which he\r\ntook after a moment\'s hesitation. Then, without uttering a single\r\nword, he returned towards the beach.\r\n\r\nFrom that day no allusion was ever made to the tragic story of the\r\n_Grampus_. Dirk Peters\' wound proved to be slight; he merely wrapped\r\na piece of sailcloth round the injured arm, and went off to his work\r\nwith entire unconcern.\r\n\r\nWe made all the preparation in our power for a prolonged\r\nhibernation. Winter was threatening us. For some days past the sun\r\nhardly showed at all through the mists. The temperature fell to 36\r\ndegrees and would rise no more, while the solar rays, casting\r\nshadows of endless length upon the soil, gave hardly any heat. The\r\ncaptain made us put on warm woollen clothes without waiting for the\r\ncold to become more severe.\r\n\r\nIcebergs, packs, streams, and drifts came in greater numbers from\r\nthe south. Some of these struck and stayed upon the coast, which was\r\nalready heaped up with ice, but the greater number disappeared in\r\nthe direction of the north-east.\r\n\r\n"All these pieces," said the boatswain, "will go to the\r\nclosing up of the iceberg wall. If Hearne and his lot of scoundrels\r\nare not ahead of them, I imagine they will find the door shut, and\r\nas they have no key to open it with--"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you think, boatswain, that our case is less desperate\r\nthan theirs?"\r\n\r\n"I do think so, Mr. Jeorling, and I have always thought so. If\r\neverything had been done as it was settled, and the lot had fallen\r\nto me to go with the boat, I would have given up my turn to one of\r\nthe others. After all, there is something in feeling dry ground\r\nunder your feet. I don\'t wish the death of anybody, but if Hearne\r\nand his friends do not succeed in clearing the iceberg barrier--if\r\nthey are doomed to pass the winter on the ice, reduced for food to a\r\nsupply that will only last a few weeks, you know the fate that\r\nawaits them!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a fate worse than ours!"\r\n\r\n"And besides," said the boatswain, "even supposing they do\r\nreach the Antarctic Circle. If the whalers have already left the\r\nfishing-grounds, it is not a laden and overladen craft that will\r\nkeep the sea until the Australian coasts are in sight."\r\n\r\nThis was my own opinion, and also that of the captain and West.\r\n\r\nDuring the following four days, we completed the storage of the\r\nwhole of our belongings, and made some excursions into the interior\r\nof the country, finding "all barren," and not a trace that any\r\nlanding had ever been made there.\r\n\r\nOne day, Captain Len Guy proposed that we should give a geographical\r\nname to the region whither the iceberg had carried us. It was named\r\nHalbrane Land, in memory of our schooner, and we called the strait\r\nthat separated the two parts of the polar continent the Jane Sound.\r\n\r\nThen we took to shooting the penguins which swarmed upon the rocks,\r\nand to capturing some of the amphibious animals which frequented the\r\nbeach. We began to feel the want of fresh meat, and Endicott\'s\r\ncooking rendered seal and walrus flesh quite palatable. Besides, the\r\nfat of these creatures would serve, at need, to warm the cavern and\r\nfeed the cooking-stove. Our most formidable enemy would be the cold,\r\nand we must fight it by every means within our power. It remained\r\nto be seen whether the amphibia would not forsake Halbrane Land at\r\nthe approach of winter, and seek a less rigorous climate in lower\r\nlatitudes. Fortunately there were hundreds of other animals to\r\nsecure our little company from hunger, and even from thirst, at\r\nneed. The beach was the home of numbers of galapagos--a kind of\r\nturtle so called from an archipelago in the equinoctial sea, where\r\nalso they abound, and mentioned by Arthur Pym as supplying food to\r\nthe islanders. It will be remembered that Pym and Peters found three\r\nof these galapagos in the native boat which carried them away from\r\nTsalal Island.\r\n\r\nThe movement of these huge creatures is slow, heavy, and waddling;\r\nthey have thin necks two feet long, triangular snake-like heads, and\r\ncan go without food for very long periods.\r\n\r\nArthur Pym has compared the antarctic turtles to dromedaries,\r\nbecause, like those ruminants, they have a pouch just where the neck\r\nbegins, which contains from two to three gallons of cold fresh\r\nwater. He relates, before the scene of the lot-drawing, that but for\r\none of these turtles the shipwrecked crew of the _Grampus_ must have\r\ndied of hunger and thirst. If Pym is to be believed, some of the\r\ngreat turtles weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds. Those of\r\nHalbrane Land did not go beyond seven or eight hundred pounds, but\r\ntheir flesh was none the less savoury.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February an incident occurred--an incident which\r\nthose who acknowledge the intervention of Providence in human\r\naffairs will recognize as providential.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o\'clock in the morning; the weather was calm; the sky\r\nwas tolerably clear; the thermometer stood at thirty-two degrees\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nWe were assembled in the cavern, with the exception of the\r\nboatswain, waiting for our breakfast, which Endicott was preparing,\r\nand were about to take our places at table, when we heard a call\r\nfrom outside.\r\n\r\nThe voice was Hurliguerly\'s, and we hurried out. On seeing us, he\r\ncried,--\r\n\r\n"Come--come quickly!"\r\n\r\nHe was standing on a rock at the foot of the hillock above the beach\r\nin which Halbrane Land ended beyond the point, and his right hand\r\nwas stretched out towards the sea.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked Captain Len Guy.\r\n\r\n"A boat."\r\n\r\n"Is it the _Halbrane\'s_ boat coming back?"\r\n\r\n"No, captain--it is not."\r\n\r\nThen we perceived a boat, not to be mistaken for that of our\r\nschooner in form or dimensions, drifting without oars or paddle,\r\nseemingly abandoned to the current.\r\n\r\nWe had but one idea in common--to seize at any cost upon this\r\nderelict craft, which would, perhaps, prove our salvation. But how\r\nwere we to reach it? how were we to get it in to the point of\r\nHalbrane Land?\r\n\r\nWhile we were looking distractedly at the boat and at each other,\r\nthere came a sudden splash at the end of the hillock, as though a\r\nbody had fallen into the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was Dirk Peters, who, having flung off his clothes, had sprung\r\nfrom the top of a rock, and was swimming rapidly towards the boat\r\nbefore we made him out.\r\n\r\nWe cheered him heartily. I never beheld anything like that swimming.\r\nHe bounded through the waves like a porpoise, and indeed he\r\npossessed the strength and swiftness of one. What might not be\r\nexpected of such a man!\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the half-breed had swum several cables\' lengths\r\ntowards the boat in an oblique direction. We could only see his head\r\nlike a black speck on the surface of the rolling waves. A period of\r\nsuspense, of intense watching of the brave swimmer succeeded.\r\nSurely, surely he would reach the boat; but must he not be carried\r\naway with it? Was it to be believed that even his great strength\r\nwould enable him, swimming, to tow it to the beach?\r\n\r\n"After all, why should there not be oars in the boat?" said the\r\nboatswain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Guy.]\r\n\r\n"He has it! He has it! Hurrah, Dirk, hurrah!" shouted\r\nHurliguerly, and Endicott echoed his exultant cheer.\r\n\r\nThe half-breed had, in fact, reached the boat and raised himself\r\nalongside half out of the water. His big, strong hand grasped the\r\nside, and at the risk of causing the boat to capsize, he hoisted\r\nhimself up to the side, stepped over it, and sat down to draw his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nAlmost instantly a shout reached our ears. It was uttered by Dirk\r\nPeters. What had he found? Paddles! It must be so, for we saw him\r\nseat himself in the front of the boat, and paddle with all his\r\nstrength in striving to get out of the current.\r\n\r\n"Come along!" said the captain, and, turning the base of the\r\nhillock, we all ran along the edge of the beach between the blackish\r\nstones that bestrewed it.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, West stopped us. The boat had reached the shelter\r\nof a small projection at that place, and it was evident that it\r\nwould be run ashore there.\r\n\r\nWhen it was within five or six cables\' lengths, and the eddy was\r\nhelping it on, Dirk Peters let go the paddles, stooped towards the\r\nafter-part of the boat, and then raised himself, holding up an inert\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAn agonized cry from Captain Len Guy rent the air!\r\n\r\n"My brother--my brother!"\r\n\r\n"He is living! He is living!" shouted Dirk Peters.\r\n\r\nA moment later, the boat had touched the beach, and Captain Len Guy\r\nheld his brother in his arms.\r\n\r\nThree of William Guy\'s companions lay apparently lifeless in the\r\nbottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nAnd these four men were all that remained of the crew of the _Jane_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nELEVEN YEARS IN A FEW PAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heading of the following chapter indicates that the adventures\r\nof William Guy and his companions after the destruction of the English\r\nschooner, and the details of their history subsequent to the\r\ndeparture of Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters, are about to be narrated\r\nwith all possible brevity.\r\n\r\nWe carried our treasure-trove to the cavern, and had the happiness of\r\nrestoring all four men to life. In reality, it was hunger, nothing\r\nbut hunger, which had reduced the poor fellows to the semblance of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of February, 1828, the crew of the _Jane_, having no reason\r\nto doubt the good faith of the population of Tsalal Island, or that\r\nof their chief, Too-Wit, disembarked, in order to visit the village\r\nof Klock-Klock, having previously put the schooner into a state of\r\ndefence, leaving six men on board.\r\n\r\nThe crew, counting William Guy, the captain, Arthur Pym, and Dirk\r\nPeters, formed a body of thirty-two men, armed with guns, pistols,\r\nand knives. The dog Tiger accompanied them.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the narrow gorge leading to the village, preceded and\r\nfollowed by the numerous warriors of Too-Wit, the little company\r\ndivided, Arthur Pym, Dirk Peters, and Allen (the sailor) entering a\r\ncleft in the hill-side with the intention of crossing it to the\r\nother side. From that moment their companions were never to see them\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval a shock was felt. The opposite hill fell down\r\nin a vast heap, burying William Guy and his twenty-eight companions.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two of these unfortunate men were crushed to death on the\r\ninstant, and their bodies would never be found under that mass of\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nSeven, miraculously sheltered in the depth of a great cleft of the\r\nhill, had survived the catastrophe. These were William Guy,\r\nPatterson, Roberts, Covin, Trinkle, also Forbes and Sexton, since\r\ndead. As for Tiger, they knew not whether he had perished in the\r\nlandslip, or whether he had escaped. There existed in the right side\r\nof the hill, as well as in the left, on either side of the fissure,\r\ncertain winding passages, and it was by crawling along these in the\r\ndarkness that William Guy, Patterson, and the others reached a\r\ncavity which let in light and air in abundance. From this shelter\r\nthey beheld the attack on the _Jane_ by sixty pirogues, the defence\r\nmade by the six men on board, the invasion of the ship by the\r\nsavages, and finally the explosion which caused the death of a vast\r\nnumber of natives as well as the complete destruction of the ship.\r\n\r\nToo-Wit and the Tsalal islanders were at first terrified by the\r\neffects of this explosion, but probably still more disappointed.\r\nTheir instincts of pillage could not be gratified, because some\r\nvalueless wreckage was all that remained of the ship and her cargo,\r\nand they had no reason to suppose that any of the crew had survived\r\nthe cleverly-contrived collapse of the hill. Hence it came about\r\nthat Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters on the one side, and William Guy and\r\nhis companions on the other, were enabled to remain undisturbed in\r\nthe labyrinths of Klock-Klock, where they fed on the flesh of\r\nbitterns--these they could catch with their hands--and the fruit\r\nof the nut-trees which grow on the hill-sides. They procured fire by\r\nrubbing pieces of soft against pieces of hard wood; there was a\r\nquantity of both within their reach.\r\n\r\nAfter a whole week of this confinement, Arthur Pym and the\r\nhalf-breed had succeeded, as we know, in leaving their hiding-place,\r\nsecuring a boat, and abandoning Tsalal Island, but William Guy and\r\nhis companions had not yet found an opportunity to escape.\r\n\r\nAfter they had been shut up in the labyrinth for twenty-one days, the\r\nbirds on which they lived began to fail them, and they recognized\r\nthat their only means of escaping hunger--(they had not to fear\r\nthirst, for there was a spring of fresh water in the interior of the\r\nhill)--was to go down again to the coast, lay hands upon a native\r\nboat, and get out to sea. Where were the fugitives to go, and what\r\nwas to become of them without provisions?--these were questions\r\nthat had to be asked, and which nobody could answer. Nevertheless,\r\nthey would not have hesitated to attempt the adventure if they could\r\nhave a few hours of darkness; but, at that time of year, the sun did\r\nnot as yet go down behind the horizon of the eighty-fourth parallel.\r\n\r\nDeath would probably have put an end to their misery had not the\r\nsituation been changed by the following events.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February, in the morning, William Guy and Patterson\r\nwere talking together, in terrible perplexity of mind, at the\r\norifice of the cavity that opened upon the country. They no longer\r\nknew how to provide for the wants of seven persons, who were then\r\nreduced to eating nuts only, and were suffering in consequence from\r\nsevere pain in the head and stomach. They could see big turtles\r\ncrawling on the beach, but how could they venture to go thither,\r\nwith hundreds of natives coming and going about their several\r\noccupations, with their constant cry of _t\xc3\xa9k\xc3\xa9li-li_?\r\n\r\nSuddenly, this crowd of people became violently agitated. Men,\r\nwomen, and children ran wildly about on every side. Some of the\r\nsavages even took to their boats as though a great danger were at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWhat was happening?\r\n\r\nWilliam Guy and his companions were very soon informed. The cause of\r\nthe tumult was the appearance of an unknown animal, a terrible\r\nquadruped, which dashed into the midst of the islanders, snapping at\r\nand biting them indiscriminately, as it sprang at their throats with\r\na hoarse growling.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the infuriated animal was alone, and might easily have been\r\nkilled by stones or arrows. Why then did a crowd of savages manifest\r\nsuch abject terror? Why did they take to flight? Why did they appear\r\nincapable of defending themselves against this one beast?\r\n\r\nThe animal was white, and the sight of it had produced the\r\nphenomenon previously observed, that inexplicable terror of\r\nwhiteness common to all the natives of Tsalal.\r\n\r\nTo their extreme surprise, William Guy and his companions recognized\r\nthe strange animal as the dog Tiger.\r\n\r\nYes! Tiger had escaped from the crumbling mass of the hill and\r\nbetaken himself to the interior of the island, whence he had\r\nreturned to Klock-Klock, to spread terror among the natives. But\r\nTiger was no mere phantom foe; he was the most dangerous and deadly\r\nof enemies, for the poor animal was mad, and his fangs were fatal!\r\n\r\nThis was the reason why the greater part of the Tsalal islanders\r\ntook to flight, headed by their chief, Too-Wit, and the Wampos, who\r\nare the leading personages of Klock-Klock. It was under these\r\nextraordinary circumstances that they abandoned their island,\r\nwhither they were destined never to return.\r\n\r\nAlthough the boats carried off the bulk of the population, a\r\nconsiderable number still remained on Tsalal, having no means of\r\nescape, and their fate accomplished itself quickly. Several natives\r\nwho were bitten by Tiger developed hydrophobia rapidly, and attacked\r\nthe others. Fearful scenes ensued, and are briefly to be summed up\r\nin one dismal statement. The bones we had seen in or near Klock-Klock\r\nwere those of the poor savages, which had lain there bleaching for\r\neleven years!\r\n\r\nThe poor dog had died, after he had done his fell work, in a corner\r\non the beach, where Dirk Peters found his skeleton and the collar\r\nbearing the name of Arthur Pym.\r\n\r\nThen, after those natives who could not escape from the island had\r\nall perished in the manner described, William Guy, Patterson,\r\nTrinkle, Covin, Forbes, and Sexton ventured to come out of the\r\nlabyrinth, where they were on the verge of death by starvation.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of existence was that of the seven survivors of the\r\nexpedition during the eleven ensuing years?\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it was more endurable than might have been supposed.\r\nThe natural products of an extremely fertile soil and the presence\r\nof a certain number of domestic animals secured them against want of\r\nfood; they had only to make out the best shelter for themselves they\r\ncould contrive, and wait for an opportunity of getting away from the\r\nisland with as much patience as might be granted to them. And from\r\nwhence could such an opportunity come? Only from one of the chances\r\nwithin the resources of Providence.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Guy, Patterson, and their five companions descended\r\nthe ravine, which was half filled with the fallen masses of the\r\nhill-face, amid heaps of scoria and blocks of black granite. Before\r\nthey left this gorge, it occurred to William Guy to explore the\r\nfissure on the right into which Arthur Pym, Dirk Peters, and Allen\r\nhad turned, but he found it blocked up; it was impossible for him to\r\nget into the pass. Thus he remained in ignorance of the existence of\r\nthe natural or artificial labyrinth which corresponded with the one\r\nhe had just left, and probably communicated with it under the dry\r\nbed of the torrent. The little company, having passed the chaotic\r\nbarrier that intercepted the northern route, proceeded rapidly\r\ntowards the north-west. There, on the coast, at about three miles\r\nfrom Klock-Klock, they established themselves in a grotto very like\r\nthat in our own occupation on the coast of Halbrane Land.\r\n\r\nAnd it was in this place that, during long, hopeless years, the\r\nseven survivors of the _Jane_ lived, as we were about to do ourselves,\r\nbut under better conditions, for the fertility of the soil of Tsalal\r\nfurnished them with resources unknown in Halbrane Land. In reality,\r\nwe were condemned to perish when our provisions should be exhausted,\r\nbut they could have waited indefinitely--and they did wait.\r\n\r\nThey had never entertained any doubt that Arthur Pym, Dirk Peters,\r\nand Allen had perished, and this was only too true in Allen\'s\r\ncase. How, indeed, could they ever have imagined that Pym and the\r\nhalf-breed had got hold of a boat and made their escape from Tsalal\r\nIsland?\r\n\r\nSo, then, as William Guy told us, not an incident occurred to break\r\nthe monotony of that existence of eleven years--not even the\r\nreappearance of the islanders, who were kept away from Tsalal by\r\nsuperstitious terror. No danger had threatened them during all that\r\ntime; but, of course, as it became more and more prolonged, they\r\nlost the hope of ever being rescued. At first, with the return of\r\nthe fine season, when the sea was once more open, they had thought\r\nit possible that a ship would be sent in search of the _Jane_. But\r\nafter four or five years they relinquished all hope.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for dwelling on this period, which extends from the\r\nyear 1828 to the year 1839. The winters were hard. The summer did\r\nindeed extend its beneficent influence to the islands of the Tsalal\r\ngroup, but the cold season, with its attendant snows, rains, and\r\ntempests, spared them none of its severity.\r\n\r\nDuring seven months Captain William Guy had not lost one of those\r\nwho had come with him safe and sound out of the trap set for them at\r\nKlock-Klock, and this was due, no doubt, to their robust\r\nconstitutions, remarkable power of endurance, and great strength of\r\ncharacter. Alas! misfortune was making ready to fall on them.\r\n\r\nThe month of May had come--it corresponds in those regions to the\r\nmonth of November in northern lands--and the ice-packs which the\r\ncurrent carried towards the north were beginning to drift past\r\nTsalal. One day, one of the seven men failed to return to the\r\ncavern. They called, they waited, they searched for him. All was in\r\nvain. He did not reappear; no doubt he had been drowned. He was\r\nnever more seen by his fellow-exiles.\r\n\r\nThis man was Patterson, the faithful companion of William Guy.\r\n\r\nNow, what William Guy did not know, but we told him, was that\r\nPatterson--under what circumstances none would ever learn--had\r\nbeen carried away on the surface of an ice-block, where he died of\r\nhunger. And on that ice-block, which had travelled so far as Prince\r\nEdward Island, the boatswain had discovered the corpse of the\r\nunfortunate man almost decomposed by the action of the warmer waters.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Len Guy told his brother of the finding of the body of\r\nPatterson, and how it was owing to the notes in his pocket-book that\r\nthe _Halbrane_ had been enabled to proceed towards the antarctic seas,\r\nWilliam Guy hid his face in his hands and wept.\r\n\r\nOther misfortunes followed upon this one.\r\n\r\nFive months after the disappearance of Patterson, in the middle of\r\nOctober, Tsalal Island was laid waste from coast to coast by an\r\nearthquake, which destroyed the south-western group almost entirely.\r\nWilliam Guy and his companions must soon have perished on the barren\r\nland, which no longer could give them food, had not the means of\r\nleaving its coast, now merely an expanse of tumbled rocks, been\r\nafforded them in an almost miraculous manner. Two days after the\r\nearthquake, the current carried ashore within a few hundred yards of\r\ntheir cavern a boat which had drifted from the island group on the\r\nsouth-west.\r\n\r\nWithout the delay of even one day, the boat was laden with as much\r\nof the remaining provisions as it could contain, and the six men\r\nembarked in it, bidding adieu for ever to the now uninhabitable\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a very strong breeze was blowing; it was impossible to\r\nresist it, and the boat was driven southwards by that very same\r\ncurrent which had caused our iceberg to drift to the coast of\r\nHalbrane Land.\r\n\r\nFor two months and a half these poor fellows were borne across the\r\nopen sea, with no control over their course. It was not until the\r\n2nd of January in the present year (1840) that they sighted\r\nland--east of the _Jane_ Sound.\r\n\r\nNow, we already knew this land was not more than fifty miles from\r\nHalbrane Land. Yes! so small, relatively, was the distance that\r\nseparated us from those whom we had sought for in the antarctic\r\nregions far and wide, and concerning whom we had lost hope.\r\n\r\nTheir boat had gone ashore far to the south-east of us. But on how\r\ndifferent a coast from that of Tsalal Island, or, rather, on one how\r\nlike that of Halbrane Land! Nothing was to be seen but sand and\r\nstones; neither trees, shrubs, nor plants of any kind. Their\r\nprovisions were almost exhausted; William Guy and his companions\r\nwere soon reduced to extreme want, and two of the little company,\r\nForbes and Sexton, died.\r\n\r\nThe remaining four resolved not to remain a single day longer in the\r\nplace where they were doomed to die of hunger. They embarked in the\r\nboat with the small supply of food still remaining, and once more\r\nabandoned themselves to the current, without having been able to\r\nverify their position, for want of instruments.\r\n\r\nThus had they been borne upon the unknown deep for twenty-five days,\r\ntheir resources were completely exhausted, and they had not eaten\r\nfor forty-eight hours, when the boat, with its occupants lying\r\ninanimate at the bottom of it, was sighted from Halbrane Land. The\r\nrest is already known to the reader of this strange eventful history.\r\n\r\nAnd now the two brothers were at length reunited in that remote\r\ncorner of the big world which we had dubbed Halbrane Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n"WE WERE THE FIRST."\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later not one of the survivors from the two schooners, the\r\n_Jane_ and the _Halbrane_, remained upon any coast of the Antarctic\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of February, at six o\'clock in the morning, the boat,\r\nwith us all (we numbered thirteen) in it, left the little creek and\r\ndoubled the point of Halbrane Land. On the previous day we had fully\r\nand finally debated the question of our departure, with the\r\nunderstanding that if it were settled in the affirmative, we should\r\nstart without delay.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Jane_ was for an immediate departure, and Captain\r\nLen Guy was not opposed to it. I willingly sided with them, and West\r\nwas of a similar opinion. The boatswain was inclined to oppose us.\r\nHe considered it imprudent to give up a certainty for the uncertain,\r\nand he was backed by Endicott, who would in any case say "ditto"\r\nto his "Mr. Burke." However, when the time came, Hurliguerly\r\nconformed to the  view of the majority with a good grace, and\r\ndeclared himself quite ready to set out, since we were all of that\r\nway of thinking.\r\n\r\nOur boat was one of those in use in the Tsalal Archipelago for\r\nplying between the islands. We knew, from the narrative of Arthur\r\nPym, that these boats are of two kinds, one resembling rafts or flat\r\nboats, the other strongly-built pirogues. Our boat was of the former\r\nkind, forty feet long, six feet in width, and worked by several\r\npaddles.\r\n\r\nWe called our little craft the _Paracuta_, after a fish which abounds\r\nin these waters. A rough image of that denizen of the southern deep\r\nwas cut upon the gunwale.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that the greater part of the cargo of the _Halbrane_\r\nwas left in our cavern, fully protected from the weather, at the\r\ndisposal of any shipwrecked people who might chance to be thrown on\r\nthe coast of Halbrane Land. The boatswain had planted a spar on the\r\ntop of this slope to attract attention. But, our two schooners\r\nnotwithstanding, what vessel would ever venture into such latitudes?\r\n\r\n_Nota Bene_.--We were just thirteen--the fatal number. Perfectly\r\ngood relations subsisted among us. We had no longer to dread the\r\nrebellion of a Hearne. (How often we speculated upon the fate of\r\nthose whom he had beguiled!)\r\n\r\nAt seven o\'clock, the extreme point of Halbrane Land lay five\r\nmiles behind us, and in the evening we gradually lost sight of the\r\nheights that variated that part of the coast.\r\n\r\nI desire to lay special stress on the fact that not a single scrap\r\nof iron entered into the construction of this boat, not so much as a\r\nnail or a bolt, for that metal was entirely unknown to the Tsalal\r\nislanders. The planks were bound together by a sort of liana, or\r\ncreeping-plant, and caulked with moss steeped in pitch, which was\r\nturned by contact with the sea-water to a substance as hard as metal.\r\n\r\nI have nothing special to record during the week that succeeded our\r\ndeparture. The breeze blew steadily from the south, and we did not\r\nmeet with any unfavourable current between the banks of the Jane\r\nSound.\r\n\r\nDuring those first eight days, the _Paracuta_, by paddling when the\r\nwind fell, had kept up the speed that was indispensable for our\r\nreaching the Pacific Ocean within a short time.\r\n\r\nThe desolate aspect of the land remained the same, while the strait\r\nwas already visited by floating drifts, packs of one to two hundred\r\nfeet in length, some oblong, others circular, and also by icebergs\r\nwhich our boat passed easily. We were made anxious, however, by the\r\nfact that these masses were proceeding towards the iceberg barrier,\r\nfor would they not close the passages, which ought to be still open\r\nat this time?\r\n\r\nI shall mention here that in proportion as Dirk Peters was carried\r\nfarther and farther from the places wherein no trace of his poor Pym\r\nhad been found, he was more silent than ever, and no longer even\r\nanswered me when I addressed him.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that since our iceberg had passed beyond\r\nthe south pole, we were in the zone of eastern longitudes counted\r\nfrom the zero of Greenwich to the hundred and eightieth degree. All\r\nhope must therefore be abandoned of our either touching at the\r\nFalklands, or finding whaling-ships in the waters of the Sandwich\r\nIslands, the South Orkneys, or South Georgia.\r\n\r\nOur voyage proceeded under unaltered conditions for ten days. Our\r\nlittle craft was perfectly sea-worthy. The two captains and West\r\nfully appreciated its soundness, although, as I have previously\r\nsaid, not a scrap of iron had a place in its construction. It had\r\nnot once been necessary to repair its seams, so staunch were they.\r\nTo be sure, the sea was smooth, its long, rolling waves were hardly\r\nruffled on their surface.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of March, with the same longitude the observation gave\r\n7\xc2\xb0 13\' for latitude. The speed of the _Paracuta_ had then been\r\nthirty miles in each twenty-four hours. If this rate of progress\r\ncould be maintained for three weeks, there was every chance of our\r\nfinding the passes open, and being able to get round the iceberg\r\nbarrier; also that the whaling-ships would not yet have left the\r\nfishing-grounds.\r\n\r\nThe sun was on the verge of the horizon, and the time was\r\napproaching when the Antarctic region would be shrouded in polar\r\nnight. Fortunately, in re-ascending towards the north we were\r\ngetting into waters from whence light was not yet banished. Then did\r\nwe witness a phenomenon as extraordinary as any of those described\r\nby Arthur Pym. For three or four hours, sparks, accompanied by a\r\nsharp noise, shot out of our fingers\' ends, our hair, and our\r\nbeards. There was an electric snowstorm, with great flakes falling\r\nloosely, and the contact produced this strange luminosity. The sea\r\nrose so suddenly and tumbled about so wildly that the _Paracuta_ was\r\nseveral times in danger of being swallowed up by the waves, but we\r\ngot through the mystic-seeming tempest all safe and sound.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, space was thenceforth but imperfectly lighted.\r\nFrequent mists came up and bounded our outlook to a few\r\ncable-lengths. Extreme watchfulness and caution were necessary to\r\navoid collision with the floating masses of ice, which were\r\ntravelling more slowly than the _Paracuta_.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noted that, on the southern side, the sky was\r\nfrequently lighted up by the broad and brilliant rays of the polar\r\naurora.\r\n\r\nThe temperature fell very perceptibly, and no longer rose above\r\ntwenty-three degrees.\r\n\r\nForty-eight hours later Captain Len Guy and his brother succeeded\r\nwith great difficulty in taking an approximate observation, with the\r\nfollowing results of their calculations:\r\n\r\n  Latitude: 75\xc2\xb0 17\' south.\r\n  Latitude: 118\xc2\xb0 3\' east.\r\n\r\nAt this date, therefore (12th March), the _Paracuta_ was distant from\r\nthe waters of the Antarctic Circle only four hundred miles.\r\n\r\nDuring the night a thick fog came on, with a subsidence of the\r\nbreeze. This was to be regretted, for it increased the risk of\r\ncollision with the floating ice. Of course fog could not be a\r\nsurprise to us, being where we were, but what did surprise us was\r\nthe gradually increasing speed of our boat, although the falling of\r\nthe wind ought to have lessened it.\r\n\r\nThis increase of speed could not be due to the current for we were\r\ngoing more quickly than it.\r\n\r\nThis state of things lasted until morning, without our being able to\r\naccount for what was happening, when at about ten o\'clock the mist\r\nbegan to disperse in the low zones. The coast on the west\r\nreappeared--a rocky coast, without a mountainous background; the\r\n_Paracuta_ was following its line.\r\n\r\nAnd then, no more than a quarter of a mile away, we beheld a huge\r\nmound, reared above the plain to a height of three hundred feet,\r\nwith a circumference of from two to three hundred feet. In its\r\nstrange form this great mound resembled an enormous sphinx; the body\r\nupright, the paws stretched out, crouching in the attitude of the\r\nwinged monster which Grecian Mythology has placed upon the way to\r\nThebes.\r\n\r\nWas this a living animal, a gigantic monster, a mastodon a thousand\r\ntimes the size of those enormous elephants of the polar seas whose\r\nremains are still found in the ice? In our frame of mind we might\r\nhave believed that it was such a creature, and believed also that\r\nthe mastodon was about to hurl itself on our little craft and crush\r\nit to atoms.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments of unreasoning and unreasonable fright, we\r\nrecognized that the strange object was only a great mound,\r\nsingularly shaped, and that the mist had just rolled off its head,\r\nleaving it to stand out and confront us.\r\n\r\nAh! that sphinx! I remembered, at sight of it, that on the night\r\nwhen the iceberg was overturned and the _Halbrane_ was carried away, I\r\nhad dreamed of a fabulous animal of this kind, seated at the pole of\r\nthe world, and from whom Edgar Poe could only wrest its secrets.\r\n\r\nBut our attention was to be attracted, our surprise, even our alarm,\r\nwas evoked soon by phenomena still more strange than the mysterious\r\nearth form upon which the mist-curtain had been raised so suddenly.\r\n\r\nI have said that the speed of the _Paracuta_ was gradually increasing;\r\nnow it was excessive, that of the current remaining inferior to it.\r\nNow, of a sudden, the grapnel that had belonged to the _Halbrane_, and\r\nwas in the bow of the boat, flew out of its socket as though drawn\r\nby an irresistible power, and the rope that held it was strained to\r\nbreaking point. It seemed to tow us, as it grazed the surface of the\r\nwater towards the shore.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" cried William Guy. "Cut away, boatswain, cut\r\naway!" shouted West, "or we shall be dragged against the rocks."\r\n\r\nHurliguerly hurried to the bow of the _Paracuta_ to cut away the rope.\r\nOf a sudden the knife he held was snatched out of his hand, the rope\r\nbroke, and the grapnel, like a projectile, shot off in the direction\r\nof the sphinx.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, all the articles on board the boat that were\r\nmade of iron or steel--cooking utensils, arms, Endicott\'s stove,\r\nour knives, which were torn from our pockets--took flight after a\r\nsimilar fashion in the same direction, while the boat, quickening\r\nits course, brought up against the beach.\r\n\r\nWhat was happening? In order to explain these inexplicable things,\r\nwere we not obliged to acknowledge that we had come into the region\r\nof those wonders which I attributed to the hallucinations of Arthur\r\nPym?\r\n\r\nNo! These were physical facts which we had just witnessed, and not\r\nimaginary phenomena!\r\n\r\nWe had, however, no time for reflection, and immediately upon our\r\nlanding, our attention was turned in another direction by the sight\r\nof a boat lying wrecked upon the sand.\r\n\r\n"The _Halbrane\'s_ boat!" cried Hurliguerly. It was indeed the\r\nboat which Hearne had stolen, and it was simply smashed to pieces;\r\nin a word, only the formless wreckage of a craft which has been\r\nflung against rocks by the sea, remained.\r\n\r\nWe observed immediately that all the ironwork of the boat had\r\ndisappeared, down to the hinges of the rudder. Not one trace of the\r\nmetal existed.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the meaning of this?\r\n\r\nA loud call from West brought us to a little strip of beach on the\r\nright of our stranded boat.\r\n\r\nThree corpses lay upon the stony soil, that of Hearne, that of\r\nMartin Holt, and that of one of the Falklands men.\r\n\r\nOf the thirteen who had gone with the sealing-master, there remained\r\nonly these three, who had evidently been dead some days.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of the ten missing men? Had their bodies been\r\ncarried out to sea?\r\n\r\nWe searched all along the coast, into the creeks, and between the\r\noutlying rocks, but in vain. Nothing was to be found, no traces of a\r\ncamp, not even the vestiges of a landing.\r\n\r\n"Their boat," said William Guy, "must have been struck by a\r\ndrifting iceberg. The rest of Hearne\'s companions have been\r\ndrowned, and only these three bodies have come ashore, lifeless."\r\n\r\n"But," asked the boatswain, "how is the state the boat is in\r\nto be explained?"\r\n\r\n"And especially," added West, "the disappearance of all the\r\niron?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said I, "it looks as though every bit had been\r\nviolently torn off."\r\n\r\nLeaving the _Paracuta_ in the charge of two men, we again took our way\r\nto the interior, in order to extend our search over a wider expanse.\r\n\r\nAs we were approaching the huge mound the mist cleared away, and the\r\nform stood out with greater distinctness. It was, as I have said,\r\nalmost that of a sphinx, a dusky-hued sphinx, as though the matter\r\nwhich composed it had been oxidized by the inclemency of the polar\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nAnd then a possibility flashed into my mind, an hypothesis which\r\nexplained these astonishing phenomena.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" I exclaimed, "a loadstone! that is it! A magnet with\r\nprodigious power of attraction!"\r\n\r\nI was understood, and in an instant the final catastrophe, to which\r\nHearne and his companions were victims, was explained with terrible\r\nclearness.\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Sphinx was simply a colossal magnet. Under the\r\ninfluence of that magnet the iron bands of the _Halbrane\'s_ boat had\r\nbeen torn out and projected as though by the action of a catapult.\r\nThis was the occult force that had irresistibly attracted everything\r\nmade of iron on the _Paracuta_. And the boat itself would have shared\r\nthe fate of the _Halbrane\'s_ boat had a single bit of that metal\r\nbeen employed in its construction. Was it, then, the proximity of\r\nthe magnetic pole that produced such effects?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An antarctic mystery.]\r\n\r\nAt first we entertained this idea, but on reflection we rejected it.\r\n\r\nAt the place where the magnetic meridians cross, the only phenomenon\r\nproduced is the vertical position of the magnetic needle in two\r\nsimilar points of the terrestrial globe. This phenomenon, already\r\nproved by observations made on the spot, must be identical in the\r\nAntarctic regions.\r\n\r\nThus, then, there did exist a magnet of prodigious intensity in the\r\nzone of attraction which we had entered. Under our eyes one of those\r\nsurprising effects which had hitherto been classed among fables was\r\nactually produced.\r\n\r\nThe following appeared to me to be the true explanation.\r\n\r\nThe Trade-winds bring a constant succession of clouds or mists in\r\nwhich immense quantities of electricity not completely exhausted by\r\nstorms, are stored. Hence there exists a formidable accumulation of\r\nelectric fluid at the poles, and it flows towards the land in a\r\npermanent stream.\r\n\r\nFrom this cause come the northern and southern auroras, whose\r\nluminous splendours shine above the horizon, especially during the\r\nlong polar night, and are visible even in the temperate zones when\r\nthey attain their maximum of culmination.\r\n\r\nThese continuous currents at the poles, which bewilder our\r\ncompasses, must possess an extraordinary influence. And it would\r\nsuffice that a block of iron should be subjected to their action for\r\nit to be changed into a magnet of power proportioned to the\r\nintensity of the current, to the number of turns of the electric\r\nhelix, and to the square root of the diameter of the block of\r\nmagnetized iron. Thus, then, the bulk of the sphinx which upreared\r\nits mystic form upon this outer edge of the southern lands might be\r\ncalculated by thousands of cubic yards.\r\n\r\nNow, in order that the current should circulate around it and make a\r\nmagnet of it by induction, what was required? Nothing but a metallic\r\nlode, whose innumerable windings through the bowels of the soil\r\nshould be connected subterraneously at the base of the block.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me also that the place of this block ought to be in the\r\nmagnetic axis, as a sort of gigantic calamite, from whence the\r\nimponderable fluid whose currents made an inexhaustible accumulator\r\nset up at the confines of the world should issue. Our compass could\r\nnot have enabled us to determine whether the marvel before our eyes\r\nreally was at the magnetic pole of the southern regions. All I can\r\nsay is, that its needle staggered about, helpless and useless. And\r\nin fact the exact location of the Antarctic Sphinx mattered little\r\nin respect of the constitution of that artificial loadstone, and the\r\nmanner in which the clouds and metallic lode supplied its attractive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn this very plausible fashion I was led to explain the phenomenon\r\nby instinct. It could not be doubted that we were in the vicinity of\r\na magnet which produced these terrible but strictly natural effects\r\nby its attraction.\r\n\r\nI communicated my idea to my companions, and they regarded this\r\nexplanation as conclusive, in presence of the physical facts of\r\nwhich we were the actual witnesses.\r\n\r\n"We shall incur no risk by going to the foot of the mound, I\r\nsuppose," said Captain Len Guy.\r\n\r\n"None," I replied.\r\n\r\n"There--yes--there!"\r\n\r\nI could not describe the impression those three words made upon us.\r\nEdgar Poe would have said that they were three cries from the depths\r\nof the under world.\r\n\r\nIt was Dirk Peters who had spoken, and his body was stretched out in\r\nthe direction of the sphinx, as though it had been turned to iron\r\nand was attracted by the magnet.\r\n\r\nThen he sped swiftly towards the sphinx-like mound, and his\r\ncompanions followed him over rough ground strewn with volcanic\r\nremains of all sorts.\r\n\r\nThe monster grew larger as we neared it, but lost none of its\r\nmythological shape. Alone on that vast plain it produced a sense of\r\nawe. And--but this could only have been a delusion--we seemed to\r\nbe drawn towards it by the force of its magnetic attraction.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the base of the mound, we found there the various\r\narticles on which the magnet had exerted its power; arms, utensils,\r\nthe grapnel of the _Paracuta_, all adhering to the sides of the\r\nmonster. There also were the iron relics of the _Halbrane\'s_ boat,\r\nall her utensils, arms, and fittings, even to the nails and the iron\r\nportions of the rudder.\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of regaining possession of any of these\r\nthings. Even had they not adhered to the loadstone rock at too great\r\na height to be reached, they adhered to it too closely to be\r\ndetached. Hurliguerly was infuriated by the impossibility of\r\nrecovering his knife, which he recognized at fifty feet above his\r\nhead, and cried as he shook his clenched fist at the imperturbable\r\nmonster,--\r\n\r\n"Thief of a sphinx!"\r\n\r\nOf course the things which had belonged to the _Halbrane\'s_ boat\r\nand the _Paracuta\'s_ were the only articles that adorned the mighty\r\nsides of the lonely mystic form. Never had any ship reached such a\r\nlatitude of the Antarctic Sea. Hearne and his accomplices, Captain\r\nLen Guy and his companions, were the first who had trodden this\r\npoint of the southern continent. And any vessel that might have\r\napproached this colossal magnet must have incurred certain\r\ndestruction. Our schooner must have perished, even as its boat had\r\nbeen dashed into a shapeless wreck.\r\n\r\nWest now reminded us that it was imprudent to prolong our stay upon\r\nthis Land of the Sphinx--a name to be retained. Time pressed, and a\r\nfew days\' delay would have entailed our wintering at the foot of\r\nthe ice-barrier.\r\n\r\nThe order to return to the beach had just been given, when the voice\r\nof the half-breed was again heard, as he cried out:\r\n\r\n"There! There! There!"\r\n\r\nWe followed the sounds to the back of the monster\'s right paw, and\r\nwe found Dirk Peters on his knees, with his hands stretched out\r\nbefore an almost naked corpse, which had been preserved intact by\r\nthe cold of these regions, and was as rigid as iron. The head was\r\nbent, a white beard hung down to the waist, the nails of the feet\r\nand hands were like claws.\r\n\r\nHow had this corpse been fixed to the side of the mound at six feet\r\nabove the ground?\r\n\r\nAcross the body, held in place by its cross-belt, we saw the twisted\r\nbarrel of a musket, half-eaten by rust.\r\n\r\n"Pym--my poor Pym!" groaned Dirk Peters.\r\n\r\nHe tried to rise, that he might approach and kiss the ossified\r\ncorpse. But his knees bent under him, a strangled sob seemed to rend\r\nhis throat, with a terrible spasm his faithful heart broke, and the\r\nhalf-breed fell back--dead!\r\n\r\nThe story was easy to read. After their separation, the boat had\r\ncarried Arthur Pym through these Antarctic regions! Like us, once he\r\nhad passed beyond the south pole, he came into the zone of the\r\nmonster! And there, while his boat was swept along on the northern\r\ncurrent, he was seized by the magnetic fluid before he could get rid\r\nof the gun which was slung over his shoulder, and hurled against the\r\nfatal loadstone Sphinx of the Ice-realm.\r\n\r\nNow the faithful half-breed rests under the clay of the Land of the\r\nAntarctic Mystery, by the side of his "poor Pym," that hero\r\nwhose strange adventures found a chronicler no less strange in the\r\ngreat American poet!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nA LITTLE REMNANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same day, in the afternoon, the _Paracuta_ departed from the\r\ncoast of the Land of the Sphinx, which had lain to the west of us\r\nsince the 21st of February.\r\n\r\nBy the death of Dirk Peters the number of the passengers was reduced\r\nto twelve. These were all who remained of the double crew of the two\r\nschooners, the first comprising thirty-eight men, the second,\r\nthirty-two; in all seventy souls. But let it not be forgotten that\r\nthe voyage of the _Halbrane_ had been undertaken in fulfillment of a\r\nduty to humanity, and four of the survivors of the _Jane_ owed their\r\nrescue to it.\r\n\r\nAnd now there remains but little to tell, and that little must be\r\nrelated as succinctly as possible. It is unnecessary to dwell upon our\r\nreturn voyage, which was favoured by the constancy of the currents\r\nand the wind to their northern course. The last part of the voyage was\r\nindeed accomplished amid great fatigue, suffering, and danger, but it\r\nended in our safe deliverance from all these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The _Paracuta_.]\r\n\r\nFirstly, a few days after our departure from the Land of the Sphinx,\r\nthe sun set behind the western horizon to reappear no more for the\r\nwhole winter. It was then in the midst of the semi-darkness of the\r\naustral night that the _Paracuta_ pursued her monotonous course. True,\r\nthe southern polar lights were frequently visible; but they were not\r\nthe sun, that single orb of day which had illumined our horizons\r\nduring the months of the Antarctic summer, and their capricious\r\nsplendour could not replace his unchanging light. That long darkness\r\nof the poles sheds a moral and physical influence on mortals which no\r\none can elude, a gloomy and overwhelming impression almost impossible\r\nto resist.\r\n\r\nOf all the _Paracuta\'s_ passengers, the boatswain and Endicott only\r\npreserved their habitual good-humour; those two were equally\r\ninsensible to the weariness and the peril of our voyage. I also\r\nexcept West, who was ever ready to face every eventuality, like a\r\nman who is always on the defensive. As for the two brothers Guy,\r\ntheir happiness in being restored to each other made them frequently\r\noblivious of the anxieties and risks of the future.\r\n\r\nOf Hurliguerly I cannot speak too highly. He proved himself a\r\nthoroughly good fellow, and it raised our drooping spirits to hear\r\nhim repeat in his jolly voice,--\r\n\r\n"We shall get to port all right, my friends, be sure of that. And,\r\nif you only reckon things up, you will see that we have had more\r\ngood luck than bad. Oh, yes, I know, there was the loss of our\r\nschooner! Poor _Halbrane_, carried up into the air like a balloon,\r\nthen flung into the deep like an avalanche! But, on the other hand,\r\nthere was the iceberg which brought us to the coast, and the Tsalal\r\nboat which brought us and Captain William Guy and his three\r\ncompanions together. And don\'t forget the current and the breeze\r\nthat have pushed us on up to now, and will keep pushing us on, I\'m\r\nsure of that. With so many trumps in our hand we cannot possibly\r\nlose the game. The only thing to be regretted is that we shall have\r\nto get ashore again in Australia or New Zealand, instead of casting\r\nanchor at the Kerguelens, near the quay of Christmas Harbour, in\r\nfront of the Green Cormorant."\r\n\r\nFor a week we pursued our course without deviation to east or west,\r\nand it was not until the 21st of March that the _Paracuta_ lost\r\nsight of Halbrane Land, being carried towards the north by the\r\ncurrent, while the coast-line of the continent, for such we are\r\nconvinced it is, trended in a round curve to the north-east.\r\n\r\nAlthough the waters of this portion of sea were still open, they\r\ncarried a flotilla of icebergs or ice-fields. Hence arose serious\r\ndifficulties and also dangers to navigation in the midst of the\r\ngloomy mists, when we had to manoeuvre between these moving masses,\r\neither to find passage or to prevent our little craft from being\r\ncrushed like grain between the millstones.\r\n\r\nBesides, Captain Len Guy could no longer ascertain his position\r\neither in latitude or longitude. The sun being absent, calculations\r\nby the position of the stars was too complicated, it was impossible\r\nto take altitudes, and the _Paracuta_ abandoned herself to the action\r\nof the current, which invariably bore us northward, as the compass\r\nindicated. By keeping the reckoning of its medium speed, however, we\r\nconcluded that on the 27th of March our boat was between the\r\nsixty-ninth and the sixty-eighth parallels, that is to say, some\r\nseventy miles only from the Antarctic Circle.\r\n\r\nAh! if no obstacle to the course of our perilous navigation had\r\nexisted, if passage between this inner sea of the southern zone and\r\nthe waters of the Pacific Ocean had been certain, the _Paracuta_ might\r\nhave reached the extreme limit of the austral seas in a few days.\r\nBut a few hundred miles more to sail, and the iceberg-barrier would\r\nconfront us with its immovable rampart, and unless a passage could\r\nbe found, we should be obliged to go round it either by the east or\r\nby the west.\r\n\r\nOnce cleared indeed--\r\n\r\nAh! once cleared, we should be in a frail craft upon the terrible\r\nPacific Ocean, at the period of the year when its tempests rage with\r\nredoubled fury and strong ships dread the might of its waves.\r\n\r\nWe were determined not to think of this. Heaven would come to our\r\naid. We should be picked up by some ship. This the boatswain\r\nasserted confidently, and we were bound to believe the boatswain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor six entire days, until the 2nd of April, the _Paracuta_ held her\r\ncourse among the ice-barrier, whose crest was profiled at an\r\naltitude of between seven and eight hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. The extremities were not visible either on the east or the\r\nwest, and if our boat did not find an open passage, we could not\r\nclear it. By a most fortunate chance a passage was found on the\r\nabove-mentioned date, and attempted, amid a thousand risks. Yes, we\r\nrequired all the zeal, skill, and courage of our men and their\r\nchiefs to accomplish such a task.\r\n\r\nAt last we were in the South Pacific waters, but our boat had\r\nsuffered severely in getting through, and it had sprung more than\r\none leak. We were kept busy in baling out the water, which also came\r\nin from above.\r\n\r\nThe breeze was gentle, the sea more calm than we could have hoped,\r\nand the real danger did not lie in the risks of navigation. No, it\r\narose from the fact that not a ship was visible in these waters, not\r\na whaler was to be seen on the fishing-grounds. At the beginning of\r\nApril these places are forsaken, and we arrived some weeks too late.\r\n\r\nWe learned afterwards that had we arrived a little sooner, we should\r\nhave met the vessels of the American expedition.\r\n\r\nIn fact, on the 1st of February, by 95\xc2\xb0 50\' longitude and 64\xc2\xb0\r\n17\' latitude, Lieutenant Wilkes was still exploring these seas in\r\none of his ships, the _Vincennes_, after having discovered a long\r\nextent of coast stretching from east to west. On the approach of the\r\nbad season, he returned to Hobart Town, in Tasmania. The same year,\r\nthe expedition of the French captain Dumont d\'Urville, which\r\nstarted in 1838, discovered Ad\xc3\xa9lie Land in 66\xc2\xb0 30\' latitude and\r\n38\xc2\xb0 21\' east longitude, and Clarie Coast in 64\xc2\xb0 30\' and 129\xc2\xb0\r\n54\'. Their campaign having ended with these important discoveries,\r\nthe _Astrolabe_ and the _Z\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9e_ left the Antarctic Ocean and returned\r\nto Hobart Town.\r\n\r\nNone of these ships, then, were in those waters; so that, when our\r\nnutshell _Paracuta_ was "alone on a lone, lone sea" beyond the\r\nice-barrier, we were bound to believe that it was no longer possible\r\nwe could be saved.\r\n\r\nWe were fifteen hundred miles away from the nearest land, and winter\r\nwas a month old!\r\n\r\nHurliguerly himself was obliged to acknowledge the last fortunate\r\nchance upon which he had counted had failed us.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of April we were at the end of our resources; the sea\r\nbegan to threaten, the boat seemed likely to be swallowed up in the\r\nangry waves.\r\n\r\n"A ship!" cried the boatswain, and on the instant we made out a\r\nvessel about four miles to the north-east, beneath the mist which\r\nhad suddenly risen.\r\n\r\nSignals were made, signals were perceived; the ship lowered her\r\nlargest boat and sent it to our rescue.\r\n\r\nThis ship was the _Tasman_, an American three-master, from\r\nCharlestown, where we were received with eager welcome and\r\ncordiality. The captain treated my companions as though they had\r\nbeen his own countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe _Tasman_ had come from the Falkland Islands where the captain had\r\nlearned that seven months previously the American schooner _Halbrane_\r\nhad gone to the southern seas in search of the shipwrecked people of\r\nthe _Jane_. But as the season advanced, the schooner not having\r\nreappeared, she was given up for lost in the Antarctic regions.\r\n\r\nFifteen days after our rescue the _Tasman_ disembarked the survivors\r\nof the crew of the two schooners at Melbourne, and it was there that\r\nour men were paid the sums they had so hardly earned, and so well\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nWe then learned from maps that the _Paracuta_ had debouched into the\r\nPacific from the land called Clarie by Dumont d\'Urville, and the\r\nland called Fabricia, which was discovered in 1838 by Bellenny.\r\n\r\nThus terminated this adventurous and extraordinary expedition, which\r\ncost, alas, too many victims. Our final word is that although the\r\nchances and the necessities of our voyage carried us farther towards\r\nthe south pole than those who preceded us, although we actually did\r\npass beyond the axial point of the terrestrial globe, discoveries of\r\ngreat value still remain to be made in those waters!\r\n\r\nArthur Pym, the hero whom Edgar Poe has made so famous, has shown\r\nthe way. It is for others to follow him, and to wrest the last\r\nAntarctic Mystery from the Sphinx of the Ice-realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Voyage Extraordinaire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AN ANTARCTIC MYSTERY ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
