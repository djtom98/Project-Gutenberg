The birth of the Prince and the Pauper.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second\r\nquarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the\r\nname of Canty, who did not want him. \xc2\xa0On the same day another English\r\nchild was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.\r\nAll England wanted him too. \xc2\xa0England had so longed for him, and hoped\r\nfor him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the\r\npeople went nearly mad for joy. \xc2\xa0Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed\r\neach other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich\r\nand poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they\r\nkept this up for days and nights together. \xc2\xa0By day, London was a sight\r\nto see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and\r\nsplendid pageants marching along. \xc2\xa0By night, it was again a sight\r\nto see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of\r\nrevellers making merry around them. \xc2\xa0There was no talk in all England\r\nbut of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in\r\nsilks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that\r\ngreat lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him--and not\r\ncaring, either. \xc2\xa0But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty,\r\nlapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had\r\njust come to trouble with his presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s early life.\r\n\r\nLet us skip a number of years.\r\n\r\nLondon was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that\r\nday. It had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many.\r\n\xc2\xa0The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the\r\npart where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge. \xc2\xa0The\r\nhouses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first,\r\nand the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second. \xc2\xa0The higher\r\nthe houses grew, the broader they grew. \xc2\xa0They were skeletons of strong\r\ncriss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster.\r\n\xc2\xa0The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look. \xc2\xa0The windows\r\nwere small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened\r\noutward, on hinges, like doors.\r\n\r\nThe house which Tom\xe2\x80\x99s father lived in was up a foul little pocket called\r\nOffal Court, out of Pudding Lane. \xc2\xa0It was small, decayed, and rickety,\r\nbut it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty\xe2\x80\x99s tribe\r\noccupied a room on the third floor. \xc2\xa0The mother and father had a sort of\r\nbedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,\r\nBet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves,\r\nand might sleep where they chose. \xc2\xa0There were the remains of a blanket\r\nor two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not\r\nrightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked\r\ninto a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at\r\nnight, for service.\r\n\r\nBet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins. \xc2\xa0They were good-hearted\r\ngirls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant. \xc2\xa0Their mother\r\nwas like them. \xc2\xa0But the father and the grandmother were a couple of\r\nfiends. \xc2\xa0They got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other\r\nor anybody else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk\r\nor sober; John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar. \xc2\xa0They made\r\nbeggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them. \xc2\xa0Among,\r\nbut not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old\r\npriest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of\r\na few farthings, and he used to get the children aside and teach them\r\nright ways secretly. Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and\r\nhow to read and write; and would have done the same with the girls,\r\nbut they were afraid of the jeers of their friends, who could not have\r\nendured such a queer accomplishment in them.\r\n\r\nAll Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nDrunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and\r\nnearly all night long. \xc2\xa0Broken heads were as common as hunger in that\r\nplace. \xc2\xa0Yet little Tom was not unhappy. \xc2\xa0He had a hard time of it, but\r\ndid not know it. \xc2\xa0It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys\r\nhad, therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing.\r\n\xc2\xa0When he came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would\r\ncurse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful\r\ngrandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that away\r\nin the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any\r\nmiserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going\r\nhungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of\r\ntreason and soundly beaten for it by her husband.\r\n\r\nNo, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s life went along well enough, especially in summer. \xc2\xa0He only\r\nbegged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were\r\nstringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time\r\nlistening to good Father Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s charming old tales and legends\r\nabout giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and\r\ngorgeous kings and princes. \xc2\xa0His head grew to be full of these wonderful\r\nthings, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and\r\noffensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he\r\nunleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in\r\ndelicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince\r\nin a regal palace. \xc2\xa0One desire came in time to haunt him day and night:\r\n\xc2\xa0it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes. \xc2\xa0He spoke of it once to\r\nsome of his Offal Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so\r\nunmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that.\r\n\r\nHe often read the priest\xe2\x80\x99s old books and got him to explain and enlarge\r\nupon them. \xc2\xa0His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him,\r\nby-and-by. \xc2\xa0His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his\r\nshabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad.\r\n\xc2\xa0He went on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but,\r\ninstead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it,\r\nhe began to find an added value in it because of the washings and\r\ncleansings it afforded.\r\n\r\nTom could always find something going on around the Maypole in\r\nCheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London\r\nhad a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was\r\ncarried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One summer\xe2\x80\x99s day he saw\r\npoor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and\r\nheard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.\r\nYes, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by Tom\xe2\x80\x99s reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a\r\nstrong effect upon him that he began to _act_ the prince, unconsciously.\r\nHis speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the\r\nvast admiration and amusement of his intimates. \xc2\xa0But Tom\xe2\x80\x99s influence\r\namong these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he\r\ncame to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a\r\nsuperior being. \xc2\xa0He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such\r\nmarvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise! \xc2\xa0Tom\xe2\x80\x99s remarks,\r\nand Tom\xe2\x80\x99s performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and\r\nthese, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him\r\nas a most gifted and extraordinary creature. \xc2\xa0Full-grown people brought\r\ntheir perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the\r\nwit and wisdom of his decisions. \xc2\xa0In fact he was become a hero to all\r\nwho knew him except his own family--these, only, saw nothing in him.\r\n\r\nPrivately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court! \xc2\xa0He was the\r\nprince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords\r\nand ladies in waiting, and the royal family. \xc2\xa0Daily the mock prince was\r\nreceived with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic\r\nreadings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed\r\nin the royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his\r\nimaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.\r\n\r\nAfter which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat\r\nhis poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch\r\nhimself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs\r\nin his dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh,\r\ngrew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed\r\nall other desires, and became the one passion of his life.\r\n\r\nOne January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up\r\nand down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour\r\nafter hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and\r\nlonging for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed\r\nthere--for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is,\r\njudging by the smell, they were--for it had never been his good luck to\r\nown and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was\r\nmurky; it was a melancholy day. \xc2\xa0At night Tom reached home so wet and\r\ntired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother\r\nto observe his forlorn condition and not be moved--after their fashion;\r\nwherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed.\r\n\xc2\xa0For a long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting\r\ngoing on in the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts\r\ndrifted away to far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company\r\nof jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had\r\nservants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders. \xc2\xa0And\r\nthen, as usual, he dreamed that _he_ was a princeling himself.\r\n\r\nAll night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved\r\namong great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes,\r\ndrinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of\r\nthe glittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a\r\nsmile, and there a nod of his princely head.\r\n\r\nAnd when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness\r\nabout him, his dream had had its usual effect--it had intensified the\r\nsordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold. \xc2\xa0Then came bitterness,\r\nand heart-break, and tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Prince.\r\n\r\nTom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy\r\nwith the shadowy splendours of his night\xe2\x80\x99s dreams. He wandered here\r\nand there in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what\r\nwas happening around him. \xc2\xa0People jostled him, and some gave him rough\r\nspeech; but it was all lost on the musing boy. \xc2\xa0By-and-by he found\r\nhimself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in\r\nthat direction. \xc2\xa0He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his\r\nimaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London. \xc2\xa0The Strand\r\nhad ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street,\r\nbut by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably\r\ncompact row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered\r\ngreat buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with\r\nample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river--grounds that are\r\nnow closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.\r\n\r\nTom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the\r\nbeautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then\r\nidled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstately palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace\r\nbeyond--Westminster. Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of\r\nmasonry, the wide-spreading wings, the frowning bastions and turrets,\r\nthe huge stone gateway, with its gilded bars and its magnificent array\r\nof colossal granite lions, and other the signs and symbols of English\r\nroyalty. \xc2\xa0Was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last? \xc2\xa0Here,\r\nindeed, was a king\xe2\x80\x99s palace. \xc2\xa0Might he not hope to see a prince now--a\r\nprince of flesh and blood, if Heaven were willing?\r\n\r\nAt each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue--that is to say,\r\nan erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel\r\nin shining steel armour. \xc2\xa0At a respectful distance were many country\r\nfolk, and people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of\r\nroyalty that might offer. \xc2\xa0Splendid carriages, with splendid people\r\nin them and splendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by\r\nseveral other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.\r\n\r\nPoor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and\r\ntimidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when\r\nall at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that\r\nalmost made him shout for joy. \xc2\xa0Within was a comely boy, tanned and\r\nbrown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all\r\nof lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little\r\njewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels;\r\nand on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened\r\nwith a great sparkling gem. \xc2\xa0Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near--his\r\nservants, without a doubt. \xc2\xa0Oh! he was a prince--a prince, a living\r\nprince, a real prince--without the shadow of a question; and the prayer\r\nof the pauper-boy\xe2\x80\x99s heart was answered at last.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big\r\nwith wonder and delight. \xc2\xa0Everything gave way in his mind instantly\r\nto one desire: \xc2\xa0that was to get close to the prince, and have a good,\r\ndevouring look at him. \xc2\xa0Before he knew what he was about, he had his\r\nface against the gate-bars. \xc2\xa0The next instant one of the soldiers\r\nsnatched him rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd\r\nof country gawks and London idlers. \xc2\xa0The soldier said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind thy manners, thou young beggar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate\r\nwith his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried\r\nout,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dar\xe2\x80\x99st thou use a poor lad like that? \xc2\xa0How dar\xe2\x80\x99st thou use the King\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s meanest subject so? \xc2\xa0Open the gates, and let him in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then.\r\nYou should have heard them cheer, and shout, \xe2\x80\x9cLong live the Prince of\r\nWales!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates,\r\nand presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his\r\nfluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.\r\n\r\nEdward Tudor said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou lookest tired and hungry: \xc2\xa0thou\xe2\x80\x99st been treated ill. \xc2\xa0Come with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen attendants sprang forward to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what; interfere,\r\nno doubt. \xc2\xa0But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and\r\nthey stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues. \xc2\xa0Edward\r\ntook Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.\r\n\xc2\xa0By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered\r\nbefore except in books. \xc2\xa0The prince, with princely delicacy and\r\nbreeding, sent away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be\r\nembarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked\r\nquestions while Tom ate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is thy name, lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Canty, an\xe2\x80\x99 it please thee, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis an odd one. \xc2\xa0Where dost live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the city, please thee, sir. \xc2\xa0Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOffal Court! \xc2\xa0Truly \xe2\x80\x99tis another odd one. \xc2\xa0Hast parents?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently\r\nprecious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it--also twin\r\nsisters, Nan and Bet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither to any other is she, so please your worship. \xc2\xa0She hath a wicked\r\nheart, and worketh evil all her days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoth she mistreat thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with\r\ndrink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to\r\nme with goodly beatings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fierce look came into the little prince\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and he cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! \xc2\xa0Beatings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Beatings_!--and thou so frail and little. \xc2\xa0Hark ye: \xc2\xa0before the night\r\ncome, she shall hie her to the Tower. \xc2\xa0The King my father\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree. \xc2\xa0The Tower is for the great\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, indeed. \xc2\xa0I had not thought of that. \xc2\xa0I will consider of her\r\npunishment. \xc2\xa0Is thy father kind to thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more than Gammer Canty, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFathers be alike, mayhap. \xc2\xa0Mine hath not a doll\xe2\x80\x99s temper. \xc2\xa0He smiteth\r\nwith a heavy hand, yet spareth me: \xc2\xa0he spareth me not always with his\r\ntongue, though, sooth to say. \xc2\xa0How doth thy mother use thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.\r\nAnd Nan and Bet are like to her in this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old be these?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen, an\xe2\x80\x99 it please you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey,\r\nmy cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but\r\nmy sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you: \xc2\xa0do thy\r\nsisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their\r\nsouls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey? \xc2\xa0Oh, dost think, sir, that _they_ have servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd prithee, why not? \xc2\xa0Who helpeth them undress at night? \xc2\xa0Who attireth\r\nthem when they rise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, sir. \xc2\xa0Would\xe2\x80\x99st have them take off their garment, and sleep\r\nwithout--like the beasts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir garment! \xc2\xa0Have they but one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good your worship, what would they do with more? \xc2\xa0Truly they have\r\nnot two bodies each.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a quaint and marvellous thought! \xc2\xa0Thy pardon, I had not meant\r\nto laugh. \xc2\xa0But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys\r\nenow, and that soon, too: \xc2\xa0my cofferer shall look to it. \xc2\xa0No, thank me\r\nnot; \xe2\x80\x99tis nothing. \xc2\xa0Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.\r\n\xc2\xa0Art learned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not if I am or not, sir. \xc2\xa0The good priest that is called Father\r\nAndrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow\xe2\x80\x99st thou the Latin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut scantly, sir, I doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLearn it, lad:  \xe2\x80\x99tis hard only at first. \xc2\xa0The Greek is harder; but\r\nneither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady\r\nElizabeth and my cousin. \xc2\xa0Thou should\xe2\x80\x99st hear those damsels at it! \xc2\xa0But\r\ntell me of thy Offal Court. \xc2\xa0Hast thou a pleasant life there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There\r\nbe Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so\r\nbravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout\r\nand fight till all are slain, and \xe2\x80\x99tis so fine to see, and costeth but\r\na farthing--albeit \xe2\x80\x99tis main hard to get the farthing, please your\r\nworship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel,\r\nlike to the fashion of the \xe2\x80\x98prentices, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prince\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flashed. \xc2\xa0Said he--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, that would not I mislike. \xc2\xa0Tell me more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would I like also. \xc2\xa0Speak on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and\r\neach doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and\r\nshout and tumble and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Twould be worth my father\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand,\r\neach covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh\r\nthe lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the\r\nworld!--we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, prithee, say no more, \xe2\x80\x99tis glorious! \xc2\xa0If that I could but clothe me\r\nin raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once,\r\njust once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego\r\nthe crown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just\r\nonce--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho, would\xe2\x80\x99st like it? \xc2\xa0Then so shall it be. \xc2\xa0Doff thy rags, and don\r\nthese splendours, lad! \xc2\xa0It is a brief happiness, but will be not less\r\nkeen for that. \xc2\xa0We will have it while we may, and change again before\r\nany come to molest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked\r\nout in the gaudy plumage of royalty. \xc2\xa0The two went and stood side by\r\nside before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to\r\nhave been any change made! \xc2\xa0They stared at each other, then at the\r\nglass, then at each other again. \xc2\xa0At last the puzzled princeling said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou make of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good your worship, require me not to answer. \xc2\xa0It is not meet that\r\none of my degree should utter the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen will _I_ utter it. \xc2\xa0Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the\r\nsame voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and\r\ncountenance that I bear. \xc2\xa0Fared we forth naked, there is none could\r\nsay which was you, and which the Prince of Wales. \xc2\xa0And, now that I\r\nam clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more\r\nnearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not\r\nthis a bruise upon your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor\r\nman-at-arms--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace! \xc2\xa0It was a shameful thing and a cruel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the little prince,\r\nstamping his bare foot.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the King--Stir not a step till I come\r\nagain! It is a command!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national\r\nimportance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying\r\nthrough the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and\r\nglowing eyes. \xc2\xa0As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars,\r\nand tried to shake them, shouting--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen! \xc2\xa0Unbar the gates!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince\r\nburst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier\r\nfetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the\r\nroadway, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that, thou beggar\xe2\x80\x99s spawn, for what thou got\xe2\x80\x99st me from his\r\nHighness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd roared with laughter. \xc2\xa0The prince picked himself out of the\r\nmud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for\r\nlaying thy hand upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI salute your gracious Highness.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then angrily--\xe2\x80\x9cBe off, thou crazy\r\nrubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled\r\nhim far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWay for his Royal Highness! \xc2\xa0Way for the Prince of Wales!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. The Prince\xe2\x80\x99s troubles begin.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was\r\nat last deserted by the rabble and left to himself. \xc2\xa0As long as he had\r\nbeen able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and\r\nroyally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very\r\nentertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was\r\nno longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.\r\nHe looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality. \xc2\xa0He\r\nwas within the city of London--that was all he knew. \xc2\xa0He moved on,\r\naimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by\r\nwere infrequent. \xc2\xa0He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed\r\nthen where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed\r\non, and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered\r\nhouses in it, and a prodigious church. \xc2\xa0He recognised this church.\r\n\xc2\xa0Scaffoldings were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was\r\nundergoing elaborate repairs. \xc2\xa0The prince took heart at once--he felt\r\nthat his troubles were at an end, now. \xc2\xa0He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the\r\nancient Grey Friars\xe2\x80\x99 Church, which the king my father hath taken from\r\nthe monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children,\r\nand new-named it Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Church. \xc2\xa0Right gladly will they serve the son\r\nof him who hath done so generously by them--and the more that that son\r\nis himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this\r\nday, or ever shall be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping,\r\nplaying at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and\r\nright noisily, too. \xc2\xa0They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion\r\nwhich in that day prevailed among serving-men and \xe2\x80\x98prentices{1}--that\r\nis to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the\r\nsize of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such\r\nscanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair\r\nfell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight\r\naround; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely\r\nand hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt;\r\nbright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large\r\nmetal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly costume.\r\n\r\nThe boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with\r\nnative dignity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth\r\nspeech with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, art thou his grace\xe2\x80\x99s messenger, beggar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prince\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his\r\nhip, but there was nothing there. \xc2\xa0There was a storm of laughter, and\r\none boy said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst mark that? \xc2\xa0He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sally brought more laughter. \xc2\xa0Poor Edward drew himself up proudly\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s bounty to use me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified. \xc2\xa0The youth who had\r\nfirst spoken, shouted to his comrades--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace\xe2\x80\x99s princely father, where be\r\nyour manners? \xc2\xa0Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to\r\nhis kingly port and royal rags!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did\r\nmock homage to their prey. \xc2\xa0The prince spurned the nearest boy with his\r\nfoot, and said fiercely--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, but this was not a joke--this was going beyond fun. \xc2\xa0The laughter\r\nceased on the instant, and fury took its place. \xc2\xa0A dozen shouted--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHale him forth! \xc2\xa0To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond! \xc2\xa0Where be the\r\ndogs? \xc2\xa0Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen followed such a thing as England had never seen before--the sacred\r\nperson of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and\r\nset upon and torn by dogs.\r\n\r\nAs night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in\r\nthe close-built portion of the city. \xc2\xa0His body was bruised, his hands\r\nwere bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud. \xc2\xa0He wandered\r\non and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint\r\nhe could hardly drag one foot after the other. \xc2\xa0He had ceased to ask\r\nquestions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of\r\ninformation. \xc2\xa0He kept muttering to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cOffal Court--that is the\r\nname; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I\r\ndrop, then am I saved--for his people will take me to the palace and\r\nprove that I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have\r\nmine own again.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment\r\nby those rude Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital boys, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am king, they\r\nshall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books;\r\nfor a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the\r\nheart. \xc2\xa0I will keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlesson be not lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning\r\nsofteneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity.\xe2\x80\x9d {1}\r\n\r\nThe lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a\r\nraw and gusty night set in. \xc2\xa0The houseless prince, the homeless heir to\r\nthe throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze\r\nof squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were\r\nmassed together.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home,\r\nI warrant me! \xc2\xa0If it be so, an\xe2\x80\x99 I do not break all the bones in thy lean\r\nbody, then am I not John Canty, but some other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned\r\nshoulder, and eagerly said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, art _his_ father, truly? \xc2\xa0Sweet heaven grant it be so--then wilt\r\nthou fetch him away and restore me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_His_ father? \xc2\xa0I know not what thou mean\xe2\x80\x99st; I but know I am _thy_\r\nfather, as thou shalt soon have cause to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, jest not, palter not, delay not!--I am worn, I am wounded, I can\r\nbear no more. \xc2\xa0Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich\r\nbeyond thy wildest dreams. \xc2\xa0Believe me, man, believe me!--I speak no\r\nlie, but only the truth!--put forth thy hand and save me! \xc2\xa0I am indeed\r\nthe Prince of Wales!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and\r\nmuttered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone stark mad as any Tom o\xe2\x80\x99 Bedlam!\xe2\x80\x9d--then collared him once more,\r\nand said with a coarse laugh and an oath, \xe2\x80\x9cBut mad or no mad, I and thy\r\nGammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m no true man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and\r\ndisappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of\r\nhuman vermin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. Tom as a Patrician.\r\n\r\nTom Canty, left alone in the prince\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet, made good use of his\r\nopportunity. \xc2\xa0He turned himself this way and that before the great\r\nmirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass. \xc2\xa0Next he\r\ndrew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it\r\nacross his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to\r\nthe lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering\r\nthe great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity. \xc2\xa0Tom\r\nplayed with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined\r\nthe costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the\r\nsumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court\r\nherd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur. \xc2\xa0He wondered if\r\nthey would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home,\r\nor if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination\r\nhad at last upset his reason.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince\r\nwas gone a long time; then right away he began to feel lonely; very\r\nsoon he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to toy with the\r\npretty things about him; he grew uneasy, then restless, then distressed.\r\nSuppose some one should come, and catch him in the prince\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, and\r\nthe prince not there to explain. \xc2\xa0Might they not hang him at once,\r\nand inquire into his case afterward? \xc2\xa0He had heard that the great\r\nwere prompt about small matters. \xc2\xa0His fear rose higher and higher; and\r\ntrembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to\r\nfly and seek the prince, and, through him, protection and release. \xc2\xa0Six\r\ngorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree, clothed\r\nlike butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed low before him. \xc2\xa0He\r\nstepped quickly back and shut the door. \xc2\xa0He said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they mock at me! \xc2\xa0They will go and tell. \xc2\xa0Oh! why came I here to\r\ncast away my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening,\r\nstarting at every trifling sound. \xc2\xa0Presently the door swung open, and a\r\nsilken page said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lady Jane Grey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded toward him.\r\nBut she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what aileth thee, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to stammer out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, be merciful, thou! \xc2\xa0In sooth I am no lord, but only poor Tom Canty\r\nof Offal Court in the city. \xc2\xa0Prithee let me see the prince, and he will\r\nof his grace restore to me my rags, and let me hence unhurt. \xc2\xa0Oh, be\r\nthou merciful, and save me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his eyes\r\nand uplifted hands as well as with his tongue. \xc2\xa0The young girl seemed\r\nhorror-stricken. \xc2\xa0She cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO my lord, on thy knees?--and to _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair, sank down,\r\nmurmuring--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no help, there is no hope. \xc2\xa0Now will they come and take me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were speeding\r\nthrough the palace. \xc2\xa0The whisper--for it was whispered always--flew from\r\nmenial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the long corridors, from\r\nstory to story, from saloon to saloon, \xe2\x80\x9cThe prince hath gone mad, the\r\nprince hath gone mad!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Soon every saloon, every marble hall, had its\r\ngroups of glittering lords and ladies, and other groups of dazzling\r\nlesser folk, talking earnestly together in whispers, and every face\r\nhad in it dismay. Presently a splendid official came marching by these\r\ngroups, making solemn proclamation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIN THE NAME OF THE KING!\r\n\r\nLet none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of death, nor\r\ndiscuss the same, nor carry it abroad. \xc2\xa0In the name of the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been\r\nstricken dumb.\r\n\r\nSoon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of \xe2\x80\x9cThe prince! See,\r\nthe prince comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying to\r\nbow in return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with\r\nbewildered and pathetic eyes. \xc2\xa0Great nobles walked upon each side of\r\nhim, making him lean upon them, and so steady his steps. Behind him\r\nfollowed the court-physicians and some servants.\r\n\r\nPresently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard\r\nthe door close behind him. \xc2\xa0Around him stood those who had come with\r\nhim. Before him, at a little distance, reclined a very large and very\r\nfat man, with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern expression. \xc2\xa0His large\r\nhead was very grey; and his whiskers, which he wore only around his\r\nface, like a frame, were grey also. \xc2\xa0His clothing was of rich stuff,\r\nbut old, and slightly frayed in places. \xc2\xa0One of his swollen legs had a\r\npillow under it, and was wrapped in bandages. \xc2\xa0There was silence now;\r\nand there was no head there but was bent in reverence, except this\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII. \xc2\xa0He\r\nsaid--and his face grew gentle as he began to speak--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now, my lord Edward, my prince? \xc2\xa0Hast been minded to cozen me, the\r\ngood King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly useth thee, with a\r\nsorry jest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let him,\r\nto the beginning of this speech; but when the words \xe2\x80\x98me, the good King\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfell upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as instantly upon\r\nhis knees as if a shot had brought him there. Lifting up his hands, he\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou the _King_? \xc2\xa0Then am I undone indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech seemed to stun the King. \xc2\xa0His eyes wandered from face to\r\nface aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy before him. \xc2\xa0Then\r\nhe said in a tone of deep disappointment--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth; but I\r\nfear me \xe2\x80\x99tis not so.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He breathed a heavy sigh, and said in a gentle\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cCome to thy father, child: \xc2\xa0thou art not well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of England,\r\nhumble and trembling. \xc2\xa0The King took the frightened face between his\r\nhands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile, as if seeking\r\nsome grateful sign of returning reason there, then pressed the curly\r\nhead against his breast, and patted it tenderly. \xc2\xa0Presently he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost not know thy father, child? \xc2\xa0Break not mine old heart; say thou\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x99st me. \xc2\xa0Thou _dost_ know me, dost thou not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea: \xc2\xa0thou art my dread lord the King, whom God preserve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true--that is well--be comforted, tremble not so; there is none\r\nhere would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee. Thou art better\r\nnow; thy ill dream passeth--is\xe2\x80\x99t not so? \xc2\xa0Thou wilt not miscall thyself\r\nagain, as they say thou didst a little while agone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth, most\r\ndread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a pauper\r\nborn, and \xe2\x80\x99tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here, albeit I was\r\ntherein nothing blameful. \xc2\xa0I am but young to die, and thou canst save me\r\nwith one little word. \xc2\xa0Oh speak it, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDie? \xc2\xa0Talk not so, sweet prince--peace, peace, to thy troubled\r\nheart--thou shalt not die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless thy\r\nland!\xe2\x80\x9d Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the two lords\r\nin waiting, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThou heard\xe2\x80\x99st it! \xc2\xa0I am not to die: \xc2\xa0the\r\nKing hath said it!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0There was no movement, save that all bowed with\r\ngrave respect; but no one spoke. \xc2\xa0He hesitated, a little confused, then\r\nturned timidly toward the King, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI may go now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo? \xc2\xa0Surely, if thou desirest. \xc2\xa0But why not tarry yet a little? Whither\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x99st go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I moved\r\nto seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery, yet which\r\nharboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to me; whereas these\r\npomps and splendours whereunto I am not used--oh, please you, sir, to\r\nlet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face betrayed a\r\ngrowing distress and uneasiness. \xc2\xa0Presently he said, with something of\r\nhope in his voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits\r\nunmarred as toucheth other matter. \xc2\xa0God send it may be so! \xc2\xa0We will make\r\ntrial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him lamely in\r\nthe same tongue. \xc2\xa0The lords and doctors manifested their gratification\r\nalso. The King said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth that his\r\nmind is but diseased, not stricken fatally. \xc2\xa0How say you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe physician addressed bowed low, and replied--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt jumpeth with my own conviction, sire, that thou hast divined\r\naright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it did from\r\nso excellent authority, and continued with good heart--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow mark ye all: \xc2\xa0we will try him further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put a question to Tom in French. \xc2\xa0Tom stood silent a moment,\r\nembarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then said\r\ndiffidently--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King fell back upon his couch. \xc2\xa0The attendants flew to his\r\nassistance; but he put them aside, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble me not--it is nothing but a scurvy faintness. \xc2\xa0Raise me! There,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tis sufficient. \xc2\xa0Come hither, child; there, rest thy poor troubled head\r\nupon thy father\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and be at peace. \xc2\xa0Thou\xe2\x80\x99lt soon be well:  \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nbut a passing fantasy. \xc2\xa0Fear thou not; thou\xe2\x80\x99lt soon be well.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then\r\nhe turned toward the company: \xc2\xa0his gentle manner changed, and baleful\r\nlightnings began to play from his eyes. \xc2\xa0He said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cList ye all! \xc2\xa0This my son is mad; but it is not permanent. \xc2\xa0Over-study\r\nhath done this, and somewhat too much of confinement. \xc2\xa0Away with his\r\nbooks and teachers! see ye to it. \xc2\xa0Pleasure him with sports, beguile him\r\nin wholesome ways, so that his health come again.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He raised himself\r\nhigher still, and went on with energy, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is mad; but he is my son,\r\nand England\xe2\x80\x99s heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign! \xc2\xa0And hear ye\r\nfurther, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh\r\nagainst the peace and order of these realms, and shall to the gallows!\r\n. . . Give me to drink--I burn: \xc2\xa0this sorrow sappeth my strength. . . .\r\nThere, take away the cup. . . . Support me. \xc2\xa0There, that is well. \xc2\xa0Mad,\r\nis he? \xc2\xa0Were he a thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I\r\nthe King will confirm it. \xc2\xa0This very morrow shall he be installed in his\r\nprincely dignity in due and ancient form. \xc2\xa0Take instant order for it, my\r\nlord Hertford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King\xe2\x80\x99s majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England\r\nlieth attainted in the Tower. \xc2\xa0It were not meet that one attainted--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace! \xc2\xa0Insult not mine ears with his hated name. \xc2\xa0Is this man to\r\nlive for ever? \xc2\xa0Am I to be baulked of my will? \xc2\xa0Is the prince to tarry\r\nuninstalled, because, forsooth, the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal\r\nfree of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours? No, by the\r\nsplendour of God! \xc2\xa0Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s doom before\r\nthe sun rise again, else shall they answer for it grievously!\xe2\x80\x9d {1}\r\n\r\nLord Hertford said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King\xe2\x80\x99s will is law;\xe2\x80\x9d and, rising, returned to his former place.\r\n\r\nGradually the wrath faded out of the old King\xe2\x80\x99s face, and he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss me, my prince. \xc2\xa0There . . . what fearest thou? \xc2\xa0Am I not thy\r\nloving father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that\r\nin truth I know. \xc2\xa0But--but--it grieveth me to think of him that is to\r\ndie, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, \xe2\x80\x99tis like thee, \xe2\x80\x99tis like thee! \xc2\xa0I know thy heart is still the\r\nsame, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou wert ever of a\r\ngentle spirit. \xc2\xa0But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours:\r\n\xc2\xa0I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great\r\noffice. Comfort thee, my prince: \xc2\xa0trouble not thy poor head with this\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it not I that speed him hence, my liege? \xc2\xa0How long might he not\r\nlive, but for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake no thought of him, my prince: \xc2\xa0he is not worthy. \xc2\xa0Kiss me once\r\nagain, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for my malady distresseth\r\nme. \xc2\xa0I am aweary, and would rest. \xc2\xa0Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy\r\npeople, and come again when my body is refreshed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last\r\nsentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would\r\nbe set free. \xc2\xa0Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nprince, the prince comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering\r\nfiles of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was indeed a\r\ncaptive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage, a\r\nforlorn and friendless prince, except God in his mercy take pity on him\r\nand set him free.\r\n\r\nAnd, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air the\r\nsevered head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk, the\r\neyes fixed on him reproachfully.\r\n\r\nHis old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so dreary!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. Tom receives instructions.\r\n\r\nTom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite, and made\r\nto sit down--a thing which he was loth to do, since there were elderly\r\nmen and men of high degree about him. \xc2\xa0He begged them to be seated\r\nalso, but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them, and remained\r\nstanding. He would have insisted, but his \xe2\x80\x98uncle\xe2\x80\x99 the Earl of Hertford\r\nwhispered in his ear--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in thy\r\npresence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to Tom, he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come upon the King\xe2\x80\x99s errand, concerning a matter which requireth\r\nprivacy. \xc2\xa0Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend\r\nyou here, save my lord the Earl of Hertford?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObserving that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford\r\nwhispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself to\r\nspeak unless he chose. \xc2\xa0When the waiting gentlemen had retired, Lord St.\r\nJohn said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of state, the\r\nprince\xe2\x80\x99s grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his\r\npower, till it be passed and he be as he was before. \xc2\xa0To wit, that he\r\nshall deny to none that he is the true prince, and heir to England\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreatness; that he shall uphold his princely dignity, and shall receive,\r\nwithout word or sign of protest, that reverence and observance which\r\nunto it do appertain of right and ancient usage; that he shall cease to\r\nspeak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured\r\nout of the unwholesome imaginings of o\xe2\x80\x99er-wrought fancy; that he shall\r\nstrive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which\r\nhe was wont to know--and where he faileth he shall hold his peace,\r\nneither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath\r\nforgot; that upon occasions of state, whensoever any matter shall\r\nperplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should\r\nmake, he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on, but\r\ntake advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford, or my humble self,\r\nwhich are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at\r\ncall, till this commandment be dissolved. Thus saith the King\xe2\x80\x99s majesty,\r\nwho sendeth greeting to your royal highness, and prayeth that God will\r\nof His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy\r\nkeeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside. \xc2\xa0Tom replied\r\nresignedly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King hath said it. \xc2\xa0None may palter with the King\xe2\x80\x99s command, or fit\r\nit to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft evasions. The King shall\r\nbe obeyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Hertford said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouching the King\xe2\x80\x99s majesty\xe2\x80\x99s ordainment concerning books and such like\r\nserious matters, it may peradventure please your highness to ease your\r\ntime with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied to the banquet\r\nand suffer harm thereby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when he saw\r\nLord St. John\xe2\x80\x99s eyes bent sorrowfully upon him. \xc2\xa0His lordship said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown surprise--but\r\nsuffer it not to trouble thee, for \xe2\x80\x99tis a matter that will not bide,\r\nbut depart with thy mending malady. \xc2\xa0My Lord of Hertford speaketh of\r\nthe city\xe2\x80\x99s banquet which the King\xe2\x80\x99s majesty did promise, some two months\r\nflown, your highness should attend. \xc2\xa0Thou recallest it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in a\r\nhesitating voice; and blushed again.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced.\r\nThe two lords exchanged significant glances, and Hertford stepped\r\nquickly toward the door. \xc2\xa0As the young girls passed him, he said in a\r\nlow voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show surprise\r\nwhen his memory doth lapse--it will grieve you to note how it doth stick\r\nat every trifle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s ear--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty\xe2\x80\x99s desire. Remember\r\nall thou canst--_seem_ to remember all else. \xc2\xa0Let them not perceive that\r\nthou art much changed from thy wont, for thou knowest how tenderly thy\r\nold play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how \xe2\x80\x99twould grieve them.\r\nArt willing, sir, that I remain?--and thine uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he was\r\nalready learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself\r\nas best he might, according to the King\xe2\x80\x99s command.\r\n\r\nIn spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young people\r\nbecame a little embarrassing at times. \xc2\xa0More than once, in truth,\r\nTom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his\r\ntremendous part; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him, or a\r\nword from one or the other of the vigilant lords, thrown in apparently\r\nby chance, had the same happy effect. \xc2\xa0Once the little Lady Jane turned\r\nto Tom and dismayed him with this question,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast paid thy duty to the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s majesty to-day, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out something\r\nat hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him\r\nwith the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate\r\ndifficulties and to be ready for them--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as touching his\r\nmajesty\xe2\x80\x99s condition; is it not so, your highness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he was\r\ngetting upon dangerous ground. \xc2\xa0Somewhat later it was mentioned that\r\nTom was to study no more at present, whereupon her little ladyship\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a pity, \xe2\x80\x99tis a pity! \xc2\xa0Thou wert proceeding bravely. \xc2\xa0But bide thy\r\ntime in patience: \xc2\xa0it will not be for long. \xc2\xa0Thou\xe2\x80\x99lt yet be graced\r\nwith learning like thy father, and make thy tongue master of as many\r\nlanguages as his, good my prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom, off his guard for the moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cI trow he cannot\r\nspeak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may\r\ntell his meaning; and as for learning of any sort soever--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, blushed, then continued low and sadly: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my malady\r\npersecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth. \xc2\xa0I meant the King\xe2\x80\x99s grace\r\nno irreverence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her \xe2\x80\x98brother\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhand between her two palms, respectfully but caressingly; \xe2\x80\x9ctrouble not\r\nthyself as to that. \xc2\xa0The fault is none of thine, but thy distemper\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou\xe2\x80\x99rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, gratefully, \xe2\x80\x9cand my\r\nheart moveth me to thank thee for\xe2\x80\x99t, an\xe2\x80\x99 I may be so bold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom.\r\n\xc2\xa0The Princess Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the\r\ntarget\xe2\x80\x99s front that the shaft was overshot; so she tranquilly delivered\r\na return volley of sounding Greek on Tom\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, and then straightway\r\nchanged the talk to other matters.\r\n\r\nTime wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole. Snags and\r\nsandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more and more at\r\nhis ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and\r\noverlooking his mistakes. \xc2\xa0When it came out that the little ladies were\r\nto accompany him to the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s banquet in the evening, his heart\r\ngave a bound of relief and delight, for he felt that he should not be\r\nfriendless, now, among that multitude of strangers; whereas, an\r\nhour earlier, the idea of their going with him would have been an\r\ninsupportable terror to him.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in the\r\ninterview than the other parties to it. \xc2\xa0They felt much as if they were\r\npiloting a great ship through a dangerous channel; they were on the\r\nalert constantly, and found their office no child\xe2\x80\x99s play. Wherefore,\r\nat last, when the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 visit was drawing to a close and the Lord\r\nGuilford Dudley was announced, they not only felt that their charge had\r\nbeen sufficiently taxed for the present, but also that they themselves\r\nwere not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their\r\nanxious voyage all over again. \xc2\xa0So they respectfully advised Tom to\r\nexcuse himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade\r\nof disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane\xe2\x80\x99s face when\r\nshe heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not\r\nunderstand. \xc2\xa0He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a sign--but he\r\nfailed to understand that also. \xc2\xa0The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue\r\nwith her usual easy grace. \xc2\xa0She made reverence and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave we leave of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s grace my brother to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for the\r\nasking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor\r\npower lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence\r\nhence. \xc2\xa0Give ye good den, and God be with ye!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he smiled inwardly\r\nat the thought, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in\r\nmy reading, and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered\r\nand gracious speech withal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to his\r\nkeepers and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner\r\nand rest me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Hertford said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us to\r\nobey. That thou should\xe2\x80\x99st rest is indeed a needful thing, since thou\r\nmust journey to the city presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to desire the\r\npresence of Sir William Herbert. \xc2\xa0This gentleman came straightway, and\r\nconducted Tom to an inner apartment. \xc2\xa0Tom\xe2\x80\x99s first movement there was\r\nto reach for a cup of water; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it,\r\ndropped upon one knee, and offered it to him on a golden salver.\r\n\r\nNext the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins,\r\ntimidly asking leave with his eye, but another silk-and-velvet\r\ndiscomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him. \xc2\xa0He\r\nmade two or three further efforts to help himself, but being promptly\r\nforestalled each time, he finally gave up, with a sigh of resignation\r\nand a murmured \xe2\x80\x9cBeshrew me, but I marvel they do not require to breathe\r\nfor me also!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid\r\nhimself down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too\r\nfull of thoughts and the room too full of people. \xc2\xa0He could not dismiss\r\nthe former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to dismiss the\r\nlatter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret--and theirs.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s departure had left his two noble guardians alone. \xc2\xa0They mused a\r\nwhile, with much head-shaking and walking the floor, then Lord St. John\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlainly, what dost thou think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlainly, then, this. \xc2\xa0The King is near his end; my nephew is mad--mad\r\nwill mount the throne, and mad remain. \xc2\xa0God protect England, since she\r\nwill need it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerily it promiseth so, indeed. \xc2\xa0But . . . have you no misgivings as to\r\n. . . as to . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker hesitated, and finally stopped. \xc2\xa0He evidently felt that he\r\nwas upon delicate ground. \xc2\xa0Lord Hertford stopped before him, looked into\r\nhis face with a clear, frank eye, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak on--there is none to hear but me. \xc2\xa0Misgivings as to what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou so near\r\nto him in blood, my lord. \xc2\xa0But craving pardon if I do offend, seemeth it\r\nnot strange that madness could so change his port and manner?--not but\r\nthat his port and speech are princely still, but that they _differ_,\r\nin one unweighty trifle or another, from what his custom was aforetime.\r\n\xc2\xa0Seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s very lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due\r\nfrom such as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his\r\nGreek and French? \xc2\xa0My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its\r\ndisquiet and receive my grateful thanks. \xc2\xa0It haunteth me, his saying he\r\nwas not the prince, and so--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, my lord, thou utterest treason! \xc2\xa0Hast forgot the King\xe2\x80\x99s command?\r\nRemember I am party to thy crime if I but listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSt. John paled, and hastened to say--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in fault, I do confess it. \xc2\xa0Betray me not, grant me this grace\r\nout of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak of this thing\r\nmore. Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I ruined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am content, my lord. \xc2\xa0So thou offend not again, here or in the\r\nears of others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken. \xc2\xa0But thou\r\nneed\xe2\x80\x99st not have misgivings. \xc2\xa0He is my sister\xe2\x80\x99s son; are not his voice,\r\nhis face, his form, familiar to me from his cradle? Madness can do all\r\nthe odd conflicting things thou seest in him, and more. \xc2\xa0Dost not recall\r\nhow that the old Baron Marley, being mad, forgot the favour of his\r\nown countenance that he had known for sixty years, and held it was\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s; nay, even claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that\r\nhis head was made of Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none\r\nto touch it, lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it? \xc2\xa0Give\r\nthy misgivings easement, good my lord. \xc2\xa0This is the very prince--I know\r\nhim well--and soon will be thy king; it may advantage thee to bear this\r\nin mind, and more dwell upon it than the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up his\r\nmistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was\r\nthoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts again, the\r\nLord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down to keep watch and\r\nward alone. \xc2\xa0He was soon deep in meditation, and evidently the longer he\r\nthought, the more he was bothered. \xc2\xa0By-and-by he began to pace the floor\r\nand mutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush, he _must_ be the prince! \xc2\xa0Will any be in all the land maintain\r\nthere can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?\r\n\xc2\xa0And even were it so, \xe2\x80\x99twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should\r\ncast the one into the other\xe2\x80\x99s place. Nay, \xe2\x80\x99tis folly, folly, folly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow were he impostor and called himself prince, look you _that_ would\r\nbe natural; that would be reasonable. \xc2\xa0But lived ever an impostor yet,\r\nwho, being called prince by the king, prince by the court, prince by\r\nall, _denied_ his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation? \xc2\xa0_No_! \xc2\xa0By\r\nthe soul of St. Swithin, no! \xc2\xa0This is the true prince, gone mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s first royal dinner.\r\n\r\nSomewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal\r\nof being dressed for dinner. \xc2\xa0He found himself as finely clothed as\r\nbefore, but everything different, everything changed, from his ruff to\r\nhis stockings. \xc2\xa0He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious\r\nand ornate apartment, where a table was already set for one. \xc2\xa0Its\r\nfurniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which\r\nwell-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto. \xc2\xa0The\r\nroom was half-filled with noble servitors. \xc2\xa0A chaplain said grace, and\r\nTom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been constitutional with\r\nhim, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley, who fastened a\r\nnapkin about his neck; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince\r\nof Wales was hereditary in this nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s family. \xc2\xa0Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cupbearer was\r\npresent, and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine. \xc2\xa0The\r\nTaster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared to\r\ntaste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of being\r\npoisoned. \xc2\xa0He was only an ornamental appendage at this time, and was\r\nseldom called upon to exercise his function; but there had been times,\r\nnot many generations past, when the office of taster had its perils,\r\nand was not a grandeur to be desired. \xc2\xa0Why they did not use a dog or a\r\nplumber seems strange; but all the ways of royalty are strange. \xc2\xa0My\r\nLord d\xe2\x80\x99Arcy, First Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows\r\nwhat; but there he was--let that suffice. \xc2\xa0The Lord Chief Butler was\r\nthere, and stood behind Tom\xe2\x80\x99s chair, overseeing the solemnities, under\r\ncommand of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who stood\r\nnear. \xc2\xa0Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these;\r\nbut they were not all in that room, of course, nor the quarter of them;\r\nneither was Tom aware yet that they existed.\r\n\r\nAll those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to\r\nremember that the prince was temporarily out of his head, and to be\r\ncareful to show no surprise at his vagaries. \xc2\xa0These \xe2\x80\x98vagaries\xe2\x80\x99 were\r\nsoon on exhibition before them; but they only moved their compassion and\r\ntheir sorrow, not their mirth. \xc2\xa0It was a heavy affliction to them to see\r\nthe beloved prince so stricken.\r\n\r\nPoor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it, or even\r\nseemed to observe it. \xc2\xa0He inspected his napkin curiously, and with deep\r\ninterest, for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric, then said\r\nwith simplicity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and without\r\nword or protest of any sort.\r\n\r\nTom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and asked what\r\nthey were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only recently that\r\nmen had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing\r\nthem as luxuries from Holland. {1} \xc2\xa0His question was answered with grave\r\nrespect, and no surprise manifested. \xc2\xa0When he had finished his dessert,\r\nhe filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody appeared to be aware of it,\r\nor disturbed by it. \xc2\xa0But the next moment he was himself disturbed by\r\nit, and showed discomposure; for this was the only service he had been\r\npermitted to do with his own hands during the meal, and he did not doubt\r\nthat he had done a most improper and unprincely thing. \xc2\xa0At that moment\r\nthe muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to\r\nlift and wrinkle. \xc2\xa0This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing\r\ndistress. \xc2\xa0He looked appealingly, first at one and then another of the\r\nlords about him, and tears came into his eyes. \xc2\xa0They sprang forward with\r\ndismay in their faces, and begged to know his trouble. \xc2\xa0Tom said with\r\ngenuine anguish--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI crave your indulgence: \xc2\xa0my nose itcheth cruelly. \xc2\xa0What is the custom\r\nand usage in this emergence? \xc2\xa0Prithee, speed, for \xe2\x80\x99tis but a little time\r\nthat I can bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNone smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the other\r\nin deep tribulation for counsel. \xc2\xa0But behold, here was a dead wall, and\r\nnothing in English history to tell how to get over it. \xc2\xa0The Master of\r\nCeremonies was not present: \xc2\xa0there was no one who felt safe to venture\r\nupon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn\r\nproblem. \xc2\xa0Alas! there was no Hereditary Scratcher. \xc2\xa0Meantime the tears\r\nhad overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks. \xc2\xa0His\r\ntwitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. \xc2\xa0At last\r\nnature broke down the barriers of etiquette: \xc2\xa0Tom lifted up an inward\r\nprayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the\r\nburdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself.\r\n\r\nHis meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad, shallow,\r\ngolden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his mouth and\r\nfingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin\r\nfor his use. \xc2\xa0Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then raised\r\nit to his lips, and gravely took a draught. \xc2\xa0Then he returned it to the\r\nwaiting lord, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, it likes me not, my lord: \xc2\xa0it hath a pretty flavour, but it\r\nwanteth strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis new eccentricity of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s ruined mind made all the hearts\r\nabout him ache; but the sad sight moved none to merriment.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table\r\njust when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with\r\nuplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning\r\nthe blessing. \xc2\xa0Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done\r\na thing unusual.\r\n\r\nBy his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private\r\ncabinet, and left there alone to his own devices. \xc2\xa0Hanging upon hooks in\r\nthe oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel\r\narmour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid\r\nin gold. \xc2\xa0This martial panoply belonged to the true prince--a recent\r\npresent from Madam Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the\r\ngauntlets, the plumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could don\r\nwithout assistance, and for a while was minded to call for help and\r\ncomplete the matter, but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away\r\nfrom dinner, and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye\r\nhim, and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services;\r\nso he restored the pretty things to their several places, and soon was\r\ncracking nuts, and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time\r\nsince God for his sins had made him a prince. \xc2\xa0When the nuts were all\r\ngone, he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet, among them one\r\nabout the etiquette of the English court. \xc2\xa0This was a prize. He lay down\r\nupon a sumptuous divan, and proceeded to instruct himself with honest\r\nzeal. \xc2\xa0Let us leave him there for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. The Question of the Seal.\r\n\r\nAbout five o\xe2\x80\x99clock Henry VIII. awoke out of an unrefreshing nap, and\r\nmuttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cTroublous dreams, troublous dreams! Mine end is\r\nnow at hand: \xc2\xa0so say these warnings, and my failing pulses do confirm\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye, and he muttered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet will not I die till _He_ go before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis attendants perceiving that he was awake, one of them asked his\r\npleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor, who was waiting without.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmit him, admit him!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the King eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor entered, and knelt by the King\xe2\x80\x99s couch, saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given order, and, according to the King\xe2\x80\x99s command, the peers of\r\nthe realm, in their robes, do now stand at the bar of the House, where,\r\nhaving confirmed the Duke of Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s doom, they humbly wait his\r\nmajesty\xe2\x80\x99s further pleasure in the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King\xe2\x80\x99s face lit up with a fierce joy. \xc2\xa0Said he--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLift me up! \xc2\xa0In mine own person will I go before my Parliament, and\r\nwith mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice failed; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks; and\r\nthe attendants eased him back upon his pillows, and hurriedly assisted\r\nhim with restoratives. \xc2\xa0Presently he said sorrowfully--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlack, how have I longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it\r\ncometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance. \xc2\xa0But speed ye, speed\r\nye! let others do this happy office sith \xe2\x80\x99tis denied to me. I put my\r\nGreat Seal in commission: \xc2\xa0choose thou the lords that shall compose it,\r\nand get ye to your work. \xc2\xa0Speed ye, man! \xc2\xa0Before the sun shall rise and\r\nset again, bring me his head that I may see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the King\xe2\x80\x99s command, so shall it be. \xc2\xa0Will\xe2\x80\x99t please your\r\nmajesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me, so that I may\r\nforth upon the business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Seal? \xc2\xa0Who keepeth the Seal but thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease your majesty, you did take it from me two days since, saying it\r\nshould no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, so in sooth I did: \xc2\xa0I do remember. . . . What did I with it?...\r\nI am very feeble. . . . So oft these days doth my memory play the\r\ntraitor with me. . . . \xe2\x80\x99tis strange, strange--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King dropped into inarticulate mumblings, shaking his grey head\r\nweakly from time to time, and gropingly trying to recollect what he\r\nhad done with the Seal. \xc2\xa0At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and\r\noffer information--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, if that I may be so bold, here be several that do remember with\r\nme how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the\r\nPrince of Wales to keep against the day that--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, most true!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the King.  \xe2\x80\x9cFetch it! \xc2\xa0Go: \xc2\xa0time flieth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Hertford flew to Tom, but returned to the King before very long,\r\ntroubled and empty-handed. \xc2\xa0He delivered himself to this effect--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and unwelcome\r\ntidings; but it is the will of God that the prince\xe2\x80\x99s affliction abideth\r\nstill, and he cannot recall to mind that he received the Seal. \xc2\xa0So came\r\nI quickly to report, thinking it were waste of precious time, and\r\nlittle worth withal, that any should attempt to search the long array of\r\nchambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point. \xc2\xa0After a\r\nlittle while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble him no more, poor child. \xc2\xa0The hand of God lieth heavy upon him,\r\nand my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I\r\nmay not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so\r\nbring him peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent. After\r\na time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his\r\nglance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly his face\r\nflushed with wrath--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, thou here yet! \xc2\xa0By the glory of God, an\xe2\x80\x99 thou gettest not about\r\nthat traitor\xe2\x80\x99s business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for\r\nlack of a head to grace withal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trembling Chancellor answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood your Majesty, I cry you mercy! \xc2\xa0I but waited for the Seal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan, hast lost thy wits? \xc2\xa0The small Seal which aforetime I was wont\r\nto take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. \xc2\xa0And, since the Great Seal\r\nhath flown away, shall not it suffice? \xc2\xa0Hast lost thy wits? \xc2\xa0Begone!\r\n\xc2\xa0And hark ye--come no more till thou do bring his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous\r\nvicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent\r\nto the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the\r\nbeheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. The river pageant.\r\n\r\nAt nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was\r\nblazing with light. \xc2\xa0The river itself, as far as the eye could reach\r\ncitywards, was so thickly covered with watermen\xe2\x80\x99s boats and with\r\npleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated\r\nby the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of\r\nflowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds. \xc2\xa0The grand terrace of\r\nstone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army\r\nof a German principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks\r\nof royal halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly\r\ncostumed servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nPresently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures\r\nvanished from the steps. \xc2\xa0Now the air was heavy with the hush of\r\nsuspense and expectancy. \xc2\xa0As far as one\xe2\x80\x99s vision could carry, he might\r\nsee the myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes\r\nfrom the glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace.\r\n\r\nA file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps. \xc2\xa0They were\r\nrichly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.\r\nSome of them were decorated with banners and streamers; some with\r\ncloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms; others with\r\nsilken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them,\r\nwhich shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes\r\nfluttered them; others of yet higher pretensions, since they belonged to\r\nnobles in the prince\xe2\x80\x99s immediate service, had their sides picturesquely\r\nfenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings. \xc2\xa0Each\r\nstate barge was towed by a tender. \xc2\xa0Besides the rowers, these tenders\r\ncarried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate,\r\nand a company of musicians.\r\n\r\nThe advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great\r\ngateway, a troop of halberdiers.  \xe2\x80\x98They were dressed in striped hose of\r\nblack and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses, and\r\ndoublets of murrey and blue cloth, embroidered on the front and back\r\nwith the three feathers, the prince\xe2\x80\x99s blazon, woven in gold. \xc2\xa0Their\r\nhalberd staves were covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt\r\nnails, and ornamented with gold tassels. \xc2\xa0Filing off on the right and\r\nleft, they formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the\r\npalace to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. \xc2\xa0A thick rayed cloth or carpet was\r\nthen unfolded, and laid down between them by attendants in the\r\ngold-and-crimson liveries of the prince. \xc2\xa0This done, a flourish of\r\ntrumpets resounded from within. \xc2\xa0A lively prelude arose from the\r\nmusicians on the water; and two ushers with white wands marched with a\r\nslow and stately pace from the portal. \xc2\xa0They were followed by an officer\r\nbearing the civic mace, after whom came another carrying the city\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsword; then several sergeants of the city guard, in their full\r\naccoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves; then the Garter\r\nKing-at-arms, in his tabard; then several Knights of the Bath, each with\r\na white lace on his sleeve; then their esquires; then the judges, in\r\ntheir robes of scarlet and coifs; then the Lord High Chancellor of\r\nEngland, in a robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled with minever;\r\nthen a deputation of aldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and then the\r\nheads of the different civic companies, in their robes of state. Now\r\ncame twelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting of\r\npourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles of\r\ncrimson velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation coloured\r\nhauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps. \xc2\xa0They were of the\r\nsuite of the French ambassador, and were followed by twelve cavaliers of\r\nthe suite of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in black velvet, unrelieved\r\nby any ornament. \xc2\xa0Following these came several great English nobles with\r\ntheir attendants.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, the\r\nfuture great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway, arrayed in a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak of crimson satin flowered\r\nwith gold, and ribanded with nets of silver.\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa0He turned, doffed\r\nhis plumed cap, bent his body in a low reverence, and began to step\r\nbackward, bowing at each step. \xc2\xa0A prolonged trumpet-blast followed, and\r\na proclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cWay for the high and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of\r\nWales!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of\r\nflame leapt forth with a thunder-crash; the massed world on the river\r\nburst into a mighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause and hero\r\nof it all, stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head.\r\n\r\nHe was \xe2\x80\x98magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with a\r\nfront-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, and edged\r\nwith ermine. \xc2\xa0Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced\r\nwith the triple-feathered crest, lined with blue satin, set with pearls\r\nand precious stones, and fastened with a clasp of brilliants. \xc2\xa0About his\r\nneck hung the order of the Garter, and several princely foreign orders;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash.\r\n\xc2\xa0O Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar\r\nwith rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. The Prince in the toils.\r\n\r\nWe left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court, with\r\na noisy and delighted mob at his heels. \xc2\xa0There was but one person in it\r\nwho offered a pleading word for the captive, and he was not heeded; he\r\nwas hardly even heard, so great was the turmoil. \xc2\xa0The Prince continued\r\nto struggle for freedom, and to rage against the treatment he was\r\nsuffering, until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him,\r\nand raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\xc2\xa0The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and the\r\nblow descended upon his own wrist. \xc2\xa0Canty roared out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou\xe2\x80\x99lt meddle, wilt thou? \xc2\xa0Then have thy reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis cudgel crashed down upon the meddler\xe2\x80\x99s head: \xc2\xa0there was a groan, a\r\ndim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd, and the next\r\nmoment it lay there in the dark alone. \xc2\xa0The mob pressed on, their\r\nenjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.\r\n\r\nPresently the Prince found himself in John Canty\xe2\x80\x99s abode, with the door\r\nclosed against the outsiders. \xc2\xa0By the vague light of a tallow candle\r\nwhich was thrust into a bottle, he made out the main features of the\r\nloathsome den, and also the occupants of it. \xc2\xa0Two frowsy girls and\r\na middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner, with the\r\naspect of animals habituated to harsh usage, and expecting and dreading\r\nit now. From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey\r\nhair and malignant eyes. \xc2\xa0John Canty said to this one--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTarry! \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s fine mummeries here. \xc2\xa0Mar them not till thou\xe2\x80\x99st enjoyed\r\nthem: \xc2\xa0then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt. \xc2\xa0Stand forth, lad. \xc2\xa0Now\r\nsay thy foolery again, an thou\xe2\x80\x99st not forgot it. Name thy name. \xc2\xa0Who art\r\nthou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe insulted blood mounted to the little prince\xe2\x80\x99s cheek once more, and\r\nhe lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man\xe2\x80\x99s face and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak. \xc2\xa0I tell\r\nthee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince of Wales, and none\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag\xe2\x80\x99s feet to the floor\r\nwhere she stood, and almost took her breath. \xc2\xa0She stared at the Prince\r\nin stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst\r\ninto a roar of laughter. \xc2\xa0But the effect upon Tom Canty\xe2\x80\x99s mother and\r\nsisters was different. \xc2\xa0Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to\r\ndistress of a different sort. \xc2\xa0They ran forward with woe and dismay in\r\ntheir faces, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor Tom, poor lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands upon his\r\nshoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears.\r\nThen she said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my poor boy! \xc2\xa0Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at\r\nlast, and ta\xe2\x80\x99en thy wit away. \xc2\xa0Ah! why did\xe2\x80\x99st thou cleave to it when I\r\nso warned thee \xe2\x80\x98gainst it? \xc2\xa0Thou\xe2\x80\x99st broke thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince looked into her face, and said gently--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame. \xc2\xa0Comfort thee:\r\nlet me to the palace where he is, and straightway will the King my\r\nfather restore him to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King thy father! \xc2\xa0Oh, my child! unsay these words that be freighted\r\nwith death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to thee. \xc2\xa0Shake of\r\nthis gruesome dream. \xc2\xa0Call back thy poor wandering memory. \xc2\xa0Look upon\r\nme. Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince shook his head and reluctantly said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I never\r\nlooked upon thy face before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and, covering her\r\neyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the show go on!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Canty.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Nan!--what, Bet! mannerless\r\nwenches! will ye stand in the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s presence? \xc2\xa0Upon your knees, ye\r\npauper scum, and do him reverence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe followed this with another horse-laugh. \xc2\xa0The girls began to plead\r\ntimidly for their brother; and Nan said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will heal his\r\nmadness: \xc2\xa0prithee, do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bet; \xe2\x80\x9che is more worn than is his wont. \xc2\xa0To-morrow\r\nwill he be himself again, and will beg with diligence, and come not\r\nempty home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis remark sobered the father\xe2\x80\x99s joviality, and brought his mind to\r\nbusiness. \xc2\xa0He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole; two\r\npennies, mark ye--all this money for a half-year\xe2\x80\x99s rent, else out of\r\nthis we go. \xc2\xa0Show what thou\xe2\x80\x99st gathered with thy lazy begging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOffend me not with thy sordid matters. \xc2\xa0I tell thee again I am the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sounding blow upon the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder from Canty\xe2\x80\x99s broad palm\r\nsent him staggering into goodwife Canty\xe2\x80\x99s arms, who clasped him to her\r\nbreast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by\r\ninterposing her own person. \xc2\xa0The frightened girls retreated to their\r\ncorner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son.\r\n\xc2\xa0The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not suffer for me, madam. \xc2\xa0Let these swine do their will\r\nupon me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about\r\ntheir work without waste of time. \xc2\xa0Between them they belaboured the boy\r\nright soundly, and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for\r\nshowing sympathy for the victim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Canty, \xe2\x80\x9cto bed, all of ye. \xc2\xa0The entertainment has tired me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe light was put out, and the family retired. \xc2\xa0As soon as the snorings\r\nof the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep,\r\nthe young girls crept to where the Prince lay, and covered him tenderly\r\nfrom the cold with straw and rags; and their mother crept to him also,\r\nand stroked his hair, and cried over him, whispering broken words of\r\ncomfort and compassion in his ear the while. \xc2\xa0She had saved a morsel for\r\nhim to eat, also; but the boy\xe2\x80\x99s pains had swept away all appetite--at\r\nleast for black and tasteless crusts. \xc2\xa0He was touched by her brave and\r\ncostly defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in\r\nvery noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep and try\r\nto forget her sorrows. \xc2\xa0And he added that the King his father would not\r\nlet her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded. \xc2\xa0This return to his\r\n\xe2\x80\x98madness\xe2\x80\x99 broke her heart anew, and she strained him to her breast again\r\nand again, and then went back, drowned in tears, to her bed.\r\n\r\nAs she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep into\r\nher mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was\r\nlacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane. \xc2\xa0She could not describe it, she could\r\nnot tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to\r\ndetect it and perceive it. \xc2\xa0What if the boy were really not her son,\r\nafter all? \xc2\xa0Oh, absurd! \xc2\xa0She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her\r\ngriefs and troubles. \xc2\xa0No matter, she found that it was an idea that\r\nwould not \xe2\x80\x98down,\xe2\x80\x99 but persisted in haunting her. \xc2\xa0It pursued her, it\r\nharassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored.\r\n\xc2\xa0At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her\r\nuntil she should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without\r\nquestion, whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these\r\nwearing and worrying doubts. \xc2\xa0Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way\r\nout of the difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to\r\ncontrive that test. \xc2\xa0But it was an easier thing to propose than to\r\naccomplish. \xc2\xa0She turned over in her mind one promising test after\r\nanother, but was obliged to relinquish them all--none of them were\r\nabsolutely sure, absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not\r\nsatisfy her. \xc2\xa0Evidently she was racking her head in vain--it seemed\r\nmanifest that she must give the matter up. \xc2\xa0While this depressing\r\nthought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular\r\nbreathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep. \xc2\xa0And while she\r\nlistened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft, startled\r\ncry, such as one utters in a troubled dream. \xc2\xa0This chance occurrence\r\nfurnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests\r\ncombined. \xc2\xa0She at once set herself feverishly, but noiselessly, to work\r\nto relight her candle, muttering to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cHad I but seen him _then_,\r\nI should have known! \xc2\xa0Since that day, when he was little, that the\r\npowder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of a sudden out of\r\nhis dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his\r\neyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the\r\npalm inward, but always with the palm turned outward--I have seen it a\r\nhundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed. \xc2\xa0Yes, I shall\r\nsoon know, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time she had crept to the slumbering boy\xe2\x80\x99s side, with the\r\ncandle, shaded, in her hand. \xc2\xa0She bent heedfully and warily over him,\r\nscarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement, and suddenly flashed\r\nthe light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles.\r\n\xc2\xa0The sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sprang wide open, and he cast a startled stare about\r\nhim--but he made no special movement with his hands.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief;\r\nbut she contrived to hide her emotions, and to soothe the boy to sleep\r\nagain; then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon\r\nthe disastrous result of her experiment. \xc2\xa0She tried to believe that her\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s madness had banished this habitual gesture of his; but she could\r\nnot do it.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chis _hands_ are not mad; they could not\r\nunlearn so old a habit in so brief a time. \xc2\xa0Oh, this is a heavy day for\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before; she could not\r\nbring herself to accept the verdict of the test; she must try the thing\r\nagain--the failure must have been only an accident; so she startled the\r\nboy out of his sleep a second and a third time, at intervals--with the\r\nsame result which had marked the first test; then she dragged herself to\r\nbed, and fell sorrowfully asleep, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot give him up--oh\r\nno, I cannot, I cannot--he _must_ be my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor mother\xe2\x80\x99s interruptions having ceased, and the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s pains\r\nhaving gradually lost their power to disturb him, utter weariness at\r\nlast sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep. Hour after hour\r\nslipped away, and still he slept like the dead. Thus four or five hours\r\npassed. Then his stupor began to lighten. Presently, while half asleep\r\nand half awake, he murmured--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir William!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, Sir William Herbert! \xc2\xa0Hie thee hither, and list to the strangest\r\ndream that ever . . . Sir William! dost hear? \xc2\xa0Man, I did think me\r\nchanged to a pauper, and . . . Ho there! \xc2\xa0Guards! Sir William! \xc2\xa0What!\r\nis there no groom of the chamber in waiting? Alack! it shall go hard\r\nwith--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat aileth thee?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a whisper near him.  \xe2\x80\x9cWho art thou calling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir William Herbert. \xc2\xa0Who art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? \xc2\xa0Who should I be, but thy sister Nan? \xc2\xa0Oh, Tom, I had forgot!\r\nThou\xe2\x80\x99rt mad yet--poor lad, thou\xe2\x80\x99rt mad yet: \xc2\xa0would I had never woke to\r\nknow it again! \xc2\xa0But prithee master thy tongue, lest we be all beaten\r\ntill we die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from his\r\nstiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back among his\r\nfoul straw with a moan and the ejaculation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! it was no dream, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished\r\nwere upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer a petted\r\nprince in a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him, but\r\na pauper, an outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den fit only for\r\nbeasts, and consorting with beggars and thieves.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises\r\nand shoutings, apparently but a block or two away. \xc2\xa0The next moment\r\nthere were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty ceased from\r\nsnoring and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knocketh? \xc2\xa0What wilt thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA voice answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow\xe2\x80\x99st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. \xc2\xa0Neither know I, nor care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelike thou\xe2\x80\x99lt change thy note eftsoons. \xc2\xa0An thou would save thy neck,\r\nnothing but flight may stead thee. \xc2\xa0The man is this moment delivering up\r\nthe ghost.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis the priest, Father Andrew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod-a-mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Canty. \xc2\xa0He roused his family, and hoarsely\r\ncommanded, \xe2\x80\x9cUp with ye all and fly--or bide where ye are and perish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the street and\r\nflying for their lives. \xc2\xa0John Canty held the Prince by the wrist, and\r\nhurried him along the dark way, giving him this caution in a low voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not our name. \xc2\xa0I will choose\r\nme a new name, speedily, to throw the law\xe2\x80\x99s dogs off the scent. \xc2\xa0Mind\r\nthy tongue, I tell thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe growled these words to the rest of the family--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London Bridge;\r\nwhoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper\xe2\x80\x99s shop on the\r\nbridge, let him tarry there till the others be come, then will we flee\r\ninto Southwark together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light;\r\nand not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude of singing,\r\ndancing, and shouting people, massed together on the river frontage.\r\nThere was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see, up\r\nand down the Thames; London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge\r\nlikewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of\r\ncoloured lights; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies\r\nwith an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain\r\nof dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were\r\ncrowds of revellers; all London seemed to be at large.\r\n\r\nJohn Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat;\r\nbut it was too late. \xc2\xa0He and his tribe were swallowed up in that\r\nswarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from each other in\r\nan instant. We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe;\r\nCanty still kept his grip upon him. \xc2\xa0The Prince\xe2\x80\x99s heart was beating high\r\nwith hopes of escape, now. \xc2\xa0A burly waterman, considerably exalted with\r\nliquor, found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough\r\nthrough the crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, whither so fast, friend? \xc2\xa0Dost canker thy soul with sordid\r\nbusiness when all that be leal men and true make holiday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Canty,\r\nroughly; \xe2\x80\x9ctake away thy hand and let me pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSith that is thy humour, thou\xe2\x80\x99lt _not_ pass, till thou\xe2\x80\x99st drunk to the\r\nPrince of Wales, I tell thee that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the waterman, barring the way\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOther revellers were interested by this time. \xc2\xa0They cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the\r\nloving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by one of\r\nits handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary\r\nnapkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty, who had to grasp\r\nthe opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the\r\nother, according to ancient custom. This left the Prince hand-free for\r\na second, of course. \xc2\xa0He wasted no time, but dived among the forest of\r\nlegs about him and disappeared. \xc2\xa0In another moment he could not have\r\nbeen harder to find, under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had\r\nbeen the Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s and he a lost sixpence.\r\n\r\nHe very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself about\r\nhis own affairs without further thought of John Canty. \xc2\xa0He quickly\r\nrealised another thing, too. \xc2\xa0To wit, that a spurious Prince of Wales\r\nwas being feasted by the city in his stead. \xc2\xa0He easily concluded that\r\nthe pauper lad, Tom Canty, had deliberately taken advantage of his\r\nstupendous opportunity and become a usurper.\r\n\r\nTherefore there was but one course to pursue--find his way to the\r\nGuildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor. \xc2\xa0He also made\r\nup his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual\r\npreparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered, according to the\r\nlaw and usage of the day in cases of high treason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. At Guildhall.\r\n\r\nThe royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its stately way\r\ndown the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats. The air was\r\nladen with music; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames; the\r\ndistant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible\r\nbonfires; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky, incrusted\r\nwith sparkling lights, wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like\r\njewelled lances thrust aloft; as the fleet swept along, it was greeted\r\nfrom the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless\r\nflash and boom of artillery.\r\n\r\nTo Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds and this\r\nspectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing. To his\r\nlittle friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane\r\nGrey, they were nothing.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook\r\n(whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under\r\nacres of buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and under bridges\r\npopulous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted, and at last came to\r\na halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard, in the centre of the ancient\r\ncity of London. \xc2\xa0Tom disembarked, and he and his gallant procession\r\ncrossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and\r\nBasinghall Street to the Guildhall.\r\n\r\nTom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord\r\nMayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and scarlet\r\nrobes of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of\r\nthe great hall, preceded by heralds making proclamation, and by the Mace\r\nand the City Sword. \xc2\xa0The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom\r\nand his two small friends took their places behind their chairs.\r\n\r\nAt a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree\r\nwere seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners took places at\r\na multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall. \xc2\xa0From their lofty\r\nvantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the ancient guardians of the\r\ncity, contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar\r\nto it in forgotten generations. \xc2\xa0There was a bugle-blast and a\r\nproclamation, and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward\r\nwall, followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a\r\nroyal baron of beef, smoking hot and ready for the knife.\r\n\r\nAfter grace, Tom (being instructed) rose--and the whole house with\r\nhim--and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess\r\nElizabeth; from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed the\r\ngeneral assemblage. \xc2\xa0So the banquet began.\r\n\r\nBy midnight the revelry was at its height. \xc2\xa0Now came one of those\r\npicturesque spectacles so admired in that old day. \xc2\xa0A description of it\r\nis still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after\r\nthe Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on\r\ntheir heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of gold, girded with two\r\nswords, called scimitars, hanging by great bawdricks of gold. \xc2\xa0Next came\r\nyet another baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin,\r\ntraversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend of\r\ncrimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of gray on\r\ntheir heads; either of them having an hatchet in their hands, and boots\r\nwith pykes\xe2\x80\x99 (points a foot long), \xe2\x80\x99turned up. \xc2\xa0And after them came\r\na knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five nobles, in\r\ndoublets of crimson velvet, voyded low on the back and before to the\r\ncannell-bone, laced on the breasts with chains of silver; and over\r\nthat, short cloaks of crimson satin, and on their heads hats after\r\nthe dancers\xe2\x80\x99 fashion, with pheasants\xe2\x80\x99 feathers in them. \xc2\xa0These were\r\nappareled after the fashion of Prussia. \xc2\xa0The torchbearers, which were\r\nabout an hundred, were appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors,\r\ntheir faces black. Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which\r\nwere disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also,\r\nthat it was a pleasure to behold.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this \xe2\x80\x98wild\xe2\x80\x99 dancing,\r\nlost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours\r\nwhich the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented, the\r\nragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and\r\nhis wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and clamouring for admission at\r\nthe gates of Guildhall! The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously,\r\nand pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter.\r\nPresently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him\r\ninto a higher and still more entertaining fury. \xc2\xa0Tears of mortification\r\nsprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right\r\nroyally. \xc2\xa0Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince of Wales!\r\nAnd all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give me word of\r\ngrace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from my ground,\r\nbut will maintain it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough thou be prince or no prince, \xe2\x80\x99tis all one, thou be\xe2\x80\x99st a gallant\r\nlad, and not friendless neither! \xc2\xa0Here stand I by thy side to prove\r\nit; and mind I tell thee thou might\xe2\x80\x99st have a worser friend than Miles\r\nHendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking. Rest thy small jaw, my\r\nchild; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very\r\nnative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect, and\r\nbearing. \xc2\xa0He was tall, trim-built, muscular. \xc2\xa0His doublet and trunks\r\nwere of rich material, but faded and threadbare, and their gold-lace\r\nadornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was rumpled and damaged;\r\nthe plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and\r\ndisreputable look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron\r\nsheath; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of\r\nthe camp. \xc2\xa0The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an\r\nexplosion of jeers and laughter. \xc2\xa0Some cried, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis another prince in\r\ndisguise!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ware thy tongue, friend: \xc2\xa0belike he is dangerous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cMarry, he looketh it--mark his eye!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cPluck the lad from him--to the\r\nhorse-pond wi\xe2\x80\x99 the cub!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this\r\nhappy thought; as instantly the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s long sword was out and the\r\nmeddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it.\r\nThe next moment a score of voices shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cKill the dog! \xc2\xa0Kill him!\r\nKill him!\xe2\x80\x9d and the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself\r\nagainst a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a\r\nmadman. \xc2\xa0His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured\r\nover their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with\r\nundiminished fury.\r\n\r\nHis moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a\r\ntrumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cWay for the King\xe2\x80\x99s messenger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of\r\nharm\xe2\x80\x99s reach as fast as their legs could carry them. The bold stranger\r\ncaught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away from danger and\r\nthe multitude.\r\n\r\nReturn we within the Guildhall. \xc2\xa0Suddenly, high above the jubilant roar\r\nand thunder of the revel, broke the clear peal of a bugle-note. \xc2\xa0There\r\nwas instant silence--a deep hush; then a single voice rose--that of the\r\nmessenger from the palace--and began to pipe forth a proclamation, the\r\nwhole multitude standing listening.\r\n\r\nThe closing words, solemnly pronounced, were--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King is dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one\r\naccord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then all sank\r\nupon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward Tom, and a\r\nmighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Tom\xe2\x80\x99s dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle,\r\nand finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him, a\r\nmoment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden purpose dawned in his\r\nface. \xc2\xa0He said, in a low tone, at Lord Hertford\xe2\x80\x99s ear--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me truly, on thy faith and honour! \xc2\xa0Uttered I here a command,\r\nthe which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter,\r\nwould such commandment be obeyed, and none rise up to say me nay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, my liege, in all these realms. \xc2\xa0In thy person bides the majesty\r\nof England. \xc2\xa0Thou art the king--thy word is law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great animation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen shall the king\xe2\x80\x99s law be law of mercy, from this day, and never\r\nmore be law of blood! \xc2\xa0Up from thy knees and away! \xc2\xa0To the Tower, and\r\nsay the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and\r\nwide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence, another\r\nprodigious shout burst forth--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reign of blood is ended! \xc2\xa0Long live Edward, King of England!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. The Prince and his Deliverer.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob,\r\nthey struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river. \xc2\xa0Their\r\nway was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge; then they\r\nploughed into the multitude again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon\r\nthe Prince\xe2\x80\x99s--no, the King\xe2\x80\x99s--wrist. \xc2\xa0The tremendous news was already\r\nabroad, and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once--\xe2\x80\x9cThe King\r\nis dead!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little\r\nwaif, and sent a shudder through his frame. \xc2\xa0He realised the greatness\r\nof his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who\r\nhad been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him. \xc2\xa0The\r\ntears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects. \xc2\xa0For an instant\r\nhe felt himself the most forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncreatures--then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching\r\nthunders:  \xe2\x80\x9cLong live King Edward the Sixth!\xe2\x80\x9d and this made his eyes\r\nkindle, and thrilled him with pride to his fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9chow grand and strange it seems--_I am King_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the\r\nbridge. \xc2\xa0This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and\r\nhad been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious\r\naffair, for a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family\r\nquarters overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of\r\nthe river to the other. \xc2\xa0The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it\r\nhad its inn, its beer-houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food\r\nmarkets, its manufacturing industries, and even its church. \xc2\xa0It\r\nlooked upon the two neighbours which it linked together--London\r\nand Southwark--as being well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise\r\nparticularly important. \xc2\xa0It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was\r\na narrow town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its\r\npopulation was but a village population and everybody in it knew all\r\nhis fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers\r\nbefore them--and all their little family affairs into the bargain. \xc2\xa0It\r\nhad its aristocracy, of course--its fine old families of butchers, and\r\nbakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old premises for five\r\nor six hundred years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from\r\nbeginning to end, and all its strange legends; and who always talked\r\nbridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and lied in a long, level,\r\ndirect, substantial bridgy way. \xc2\xa0It was just the sort of population to\r\nbe narrow and ignorant and self-conceited. Children were born on the\r\nBridge, were reared there, grew to old age, and finally died without\r\never having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge\r\nalone. \xc2\xa0Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and\r\ninterminable procession which moved through its street night and day,\r\nwith its confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing\r\nand bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in\r\nthis world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it. \xc2\xa0And so they\r\nwere, in effect--at least they could exhibit it from their windows, and\r\ndid--for a consideration--whenever a returning king or hero gave it a\r\nfleeting splendour, for there was no place like it for affording a long,\r\nstraight, uninterrupted view of marching columns.\r\n\r\nMen born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and\r\ninane elsewhere. \xc2\xa0History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at\r\nthe age of seventy-one and retired to the country. \xc2\xa0But he could only\r\nfret and toss in his bed; he could not go to sleep, the deep stillness\r\nwas so painful, so awful, so oppressive. \xc2\xa0When he was worn out with it,\r\nat last, he fled back to his old home, a lean and haggard spectre, and\r\nfell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of\r\nthe lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge.\r\n\r\nIn the times of which we are writing, the Bridge furnished \xe2\x80\x98object\r\nlessons\xe2\x80\x99 in English history for its children--namely, the livid and\r\ndecaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its\r\ngateways. \xc2\xa0But we digress.\r\n\r\nHendon\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge. \xc2\xa0As he neared\r\nthe door with his small friend, a rough voice said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, thou\xe2\x80\x99rt come at last! \xc2\xa0Thou\xe2\x80\x99lt not escape again, I warrant thee;\r\nand if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat, thou\xe2\x80\x99lt\r\nnot keep us waiting another time, mayhap,\xe2\x80\x9d--and John Canty put out his\r\nhand to seize the boy.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon stepped in the way and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot too fast, friend. \xc2\xa0Thou art needlessly rough, methinks. \xc2\xa0What is\r\nthe lad to thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others\xe2\x80\x99 affairs,\r\nhe is my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the little King, hotly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy small headpiece be sound\r\nor cracked, my boy. \xc2\xa0But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father\r\nor no, \xe2\x80\x99tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse,\r\naccording to his threat, so thou prefer to bide with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, I do--I know him not, I loathe him, and will die before I will go\r\nwith him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen \xe2\x80\x99tis settled, and there is nought more to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see, as to that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed John Canty, striding past Hendon to\r\nget at the boy; \xe2\x80\x9cby force shall he--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou do but touch him, thou animated offal, I will spit thee like a\r\ngoose!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hendon, barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword\r\nhilt. \xc2\xa0Canty drew back.  \xe2\x80\x9cNow mark ye,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hendon, \xe2\x80\x9cI took this\r\nlad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled\r\nhim, mayhap killed him; dost imagine I will desert him now to a worser\r\nfate?--for whether thou art his father or no--and sooth to say, I think\r\nit is a lie--a decent swift death were better for such a lad than life\r\nin such brute hands as thine. \xc2\xa0So go thy ways, and set quick about it,\r\nfor I like not much bandying of words, being not over-patient in my\r\nnature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Canty moved off, muttering threats and curses, and was swallowed\r\nfrom sight in the crowd. \xc2\xa0Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his\r\nroom, with his charge, after ordering a meal to be sent thither. \xc2\xa0It\r\nwas a poor apartment, with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old\r\nfurniture in it, and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles.\r\nThe little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it, almost\r\nexhausted with hunger and fatigue. \xc2\xa0He had been on his feet a good\r\npart of a day and a night (for it was now two or three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning), and had eaten nothing meantime. \xc2\xa0He murmured drowsily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrithee call me when the table is spread,\xe2\x80\x9d and sank into a deep sleep\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nA smile twinkled in Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and he said to himself--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the mass, the little beggar takes to one\xe2\x80\x99s quarters and usurps one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them--with never\r\na by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of the sort. \xc2\xa0In his\r\ndiseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales, and bravely doth\r\nhe keep up the character. \xc2\xa0Poor little friendless rat, doubtless his\r\nmind has been disordered with ill-usage. \xc2\xa0Well, I will be his friend;\r\nI have saved him, and it draweth me strongly to him; already I love the\r\nbold-tongued little rascal. \xc2\xa0How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble\r\nand flung back his high defiance! \xc2\xa0And what a comely, sweet and gentle\r\nface he hath, now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its\r\ngriefs. I will teach him; I will cure his malady; yea, I will be his\r\nelder brother, and care for him and watch over him; and whoso would\r\nshame him or do him hurt may order his shroud, for though I be burnt for\r\nit he shall need it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying\r\ninterest, tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the\r\ntangled curls with his great brown hand. \xc2\xa0A slight shiver passed over\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s form. Hendon muttered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, now, how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill\r\nhis body with deadly rheums. \xc2\xa0Now what shall I do? \xe2\x80\x99twill wake him to\r\ntake him up and put him within the bed, and he sorely needeth sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked about for extra covering, but finding none, doffed his doublet\r\nand wrapped the lad in it, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI am used to nipping air and scant\r\napparel, \xe2\x80\x99tis little I shall mind the cold!\xe2\x80\x9d--then walked up and down\r\nthe room, to keep his blood in motion, soliloquising as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales; \xe2\x80\x99twill be odd to\r\nhave a Prince of Wales still with us, now that he that _was_ the prince\r\nis prince no more, but king--for this poor mind is set upon the one\r\nfantasy, and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince\r\nand call itself the king. . . If my father liveth still, after these\r\nseven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon, he\r\nwill welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake; so\r\nwill my good elder brother, Arthur; my other brother, Hugh--but I will\r\ncrack his crown an _he_ interfere, the fox-hearted, ill-conditioned\r\nanimal! Yes, thither will we fare--and straightway, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed it upon a small deal\r\ntable, placed the chairs, and took his departure, leaving such cheap\r\nlodgers as these to wait upon themselves. \xc2\xa0The door slammed after him,\r\nand the noise woke the boy, who sprang to a sitting posture, and shot\r\na glad glance about him; then a grieved look came into his face and he\r\nmurmured to himself, with a deep sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cAlack, it was but a dream, woe\r\nis me!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Next he noticed Miles Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s doublet--glanced from that to\r\nHendon, comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him, and said,\r\ngently--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art good to me, yes, thou art very good to me. \xc2\xa0Take it and put it\r\non--I shall not need it more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood\r\nthere, waiting. \xc2\xa0Hendon said in a cheery voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a right hearty sup and bite, now, for everything is savoury\r\nand smoking hot, and that and thy nap together will make thee a little\r\nman again, never fear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, that was filled with\r\ngrave surprise, and also somewhat touched with impatience, upon the tall\r\nknight of the sword. \xc2\xa0Hendon was puzzled, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s amiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood sir, I would wash me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is that all? \xc2\xa0Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou\r\ncravest. \xc2\xa0Make thyself perfectly free here, and welcome, with all that\r\nare his belongings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor once or\r\ntwice with his small impatient foot. \xc2\xa0Hendon was wholly perplexed. \xc2\xa0Said\r\nhe--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless us, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrithee pour the water, and make not so many words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cBy all the\r\nsaints, but this is admirable!\xe2\x80\x9d stepped briskly forward and did the\r\nsmall insolent\xe2\x80\x99s bidding; then stood by, in a sort of stupefaction,\r\nuntil the command, \xe2\x80\x9cCome--the towel!\xe2\x80\x9d woke him sharply up. \xc2\xa0He took up a\r\ntowel, from under the boy\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and handed it to him without comment.\r\n\xc2\xa0He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash, and while he was\r\nat it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall\r\nto. Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the\r\nother chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said,\r\nindignantly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForbear! \xc2\xa0Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis blow staggered Hendon to his foundations. \xc2\xa0He muttered to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo, the poor thing\xe2\x80\x99s madness is up with the time! \xc2\xa0It hath changed\r\nwith the great change that is come to the realm, and now in fancy is\r\nhe _king_! Good lack, I must humour the conceit, too--there is no other\r\nway--faith, he would order me to the Tower, else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table,\r\ntook his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in the\r\ncourtliest way he was capable of.\r\n\r\nWhile the King ate, the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little,\r\nand with his growing contentment came a desire to talk. He said--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sire,\xe2\x80\x9d Miles replied; then observed to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I _must_\r\nhumour the poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s madness, I must \xe2\x80\x98Sire\xe2\x80\x99 him, I must \xe2\x80\x98Majesty\xe2\x80\x99 him,\r\nI must not go by halves, I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the\r\npart I play, else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable\r\nand kindly cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine, and said--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould know thee--tell me thy story. \xc2\xa0Thou hast a gallant way with thee,\r\nand a noble--art nobly born?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are of the tail of the nobility, good your Majesty. \xc2\xa0My father is\r\na baronet--one of the smaller lords by knight service {2}--Sir Richard\r\nHendon of Hendon Hall, by Monk\xe2\x80\x99s Holm in Kent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name has escaped my memory. \xc2\xa0Go on--tell me thy story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis not much, your Majesty, yet perchance it may beguile a short\r\nhalf-hour for want of a better. \xc2\xa0My father, Sir Richard, is very rich,\r\nand of a most generous nature. \xc2\xa0My mother died whilst I was yet a\r\nboy. \xc2\xa0I have two brothers: \xc2\xa0Arthur, my elder, with a soul like to\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s; and Hugh, younger than I, a mean spirit, covetous,\r\ntreacherous, vicious, underhanded--a reptile. \xc2\xa0Such was he from the\r\ncradle; such was he ten years past, when I last saw him--a ripe rascal\r\nat nineteen, I being twenty then, and Arthur twenty-two. \xc2\xa0There is\r\nnone other of us but the Lady Edith, my cousin--she was sixteen\r\nthen--beautiful, gentle, good, the daughter of an earl, the last of her\r\nrace, heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title. \xc2\xa0My father was her\r\nguardian. \xc2\xa0I loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed to Arthur\r\nfrom the cradle, and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be\r\nbroken. \xc2\xa0Arthur loved another maid, and bade us be of good cheer and\r\nhold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give\r\nsuccess to our several causes. \xc2\xa0Hugh loved the Lady Edith\xe2\x80\x99s fortune,\r\nthough in truth he said it was herself he loved--but then \xe2\x80\x99twas his way,\r\nalway, to say the one thing and mean the other. \xc2\xa0But he lost his arts\r\nupon the girl; he could deceive my father, but none else. \xc2\xa0My father\r\nloved him best of us all, and trusted and believed him; for he was the\r\nyoungest child, and others hated him--these qualities being in all\r\nages sufficient to win a parent\xe2\x80\x99s dearest love; and he had a smooth\r\npersuasive tongue, with an admirable gift of lying--and these be\r\nqualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself.\r\n\xc2\xa0I was wild--in troth I might go yet farther and say _very_ wild, though\r\n\xe2\x80\x98twas a wildness of an innocent sort, since it hurt none but me, brought\r\nshame to none, nor loss, nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness,\r\nor what might not beseem mine honourable degree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account--he seeing\r\nthat our brother Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s health was but indifferent, and hoping the\r\nworst might work him profit were I swept out of the path--so--but \xe2\x80\x99twere\r\na long tale, good my liege, and little worth the telling. \xc2\xa0Briefly,\r\nthen, this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them\r\ncrimes; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine\r\napartments--conveyed thither by his own means--and did convince my\r\nfather by this, and suborned evidence of servants and other lying\r\nknaves, that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in\r\nrank defiance of his will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier\r\nand a man of me, my father said, and teach me some degree of wisdom.\r\n\xc2\xa0I fought out my long probation in the continental wars, tasting\r\nsumptuously of hard knocks, privation, and adventure; but in my last\r\nbattle I was taken captive, and during the seven years that have waxed\r\nand waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath harboured me. \xc2\xa0Through wit\r\nand courage I won to the free air at last, and fled hither straight; and\r\nam but just arrived, right poor in purse and raiment, and poorer still\r\nin knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall,\r\nits people and belongings. \xc2\xa0So please you, sir, my meagre tale is told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast been shamefully abused!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little King, with a\r\nflashing eye.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will right thee--by the cross will I! \xc2\xa0The King\r\nhath said it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, fired by the story of Miles\xe2\x80\x99s wrongs, he loosed his tongue and\r\npoured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his\r\nastonished listener. \xc2\xa0When he had finished, Miles said to himself--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo, what an imagination he hath! \xc2\xa0Verily, this is no common mind; else,\r\ncrazed or sane, it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this\r\nout of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt.\r\nPoor ruined little head, it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I\r\nbide with the living. \xc2\xa0He shall never leave my side; he shall be my\r\npet, my little comrade. \xc2\xa0And he shall be cured!--ay, made whole and\r\nsound--then will he make himself a name--and proud shall I be to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he is mine--I took him, a homeless little ragamuffin, but I saw\r\nwhat was in him, and I said his name would be heard some day--behold\r\nhim, observe him--was I right?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King spoke--in a thoughtful, measured voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou didst save me injury and shame, perchance my life, and so my\r\ncrown. Such service demandeth rich reward. \xc2\xa0Name thy desire, and so it\r\nbe within the compass of my royal power, it is thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie. \xc2\xa0He was\r\nabout to thank the King and put the matter aside with saying he had only\r\ndone his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser thought came into his\r\nhead, and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the\r\ngracious offer--an idea which the King gravely approved, remarking that\r\nit was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import.\r\n\r\nMiles reflected during some moments, then said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is\r\nthe thing to do--by any other means it were impossible to get at it--and\r\ncertes, this hour\xe2\x80\x99s experience has taught me \xe2\x80\x99twould be most wearing and\r\ninconvenient to continue it as it is. Yes, I will propose it; \xe2\x80\x99twas a\r\nhappy accident that I did not throw the chance away.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then he dropped\r\nupon one knee and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject\xe2\x80\x99s simple duty,\r\nand therefore hath no merit; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold\r\nit worthy some reward, I take heart of grace to make petition to this\r\neffect. \xc2\xa0Near four hundred years ago, as your grace knoweth, there being\r\nill blood betwixt John, King of England, and the King of France, it was\r\ndecreed that two champions should fight together in the lists, and so\r\nsettle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God. \xc2\xa0These two\r\nkings, and the Spanish king, being assembled to witness and judge the\r\nconflict, the French champion appeared; but so redoubtable was he, that\r\nour English knights refused to measure weapons with him. \xc2\xa0So the matter,\r\nwhich was a weighty one, was like to go against the English monarch by\r\ndefault. \xc2\xa0Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest arm in\r\nEngland, stripped of his honours and possessions, and wasting with\r\nlong captivity. \xc2\xa0Appeal was made to him; he gave assent, and came forth\r\narrayed for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge\r\nframe and hear his famous name but he fled away, and the French king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncause was lost. \xc2\xa0King John restored De Courcy\xe2\x80\x99s titles and possessions,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98Name thy wish and thou shalt have it, though it cost me half\r\nmy kingdom;\xe2\x80\x99 whereat De Courcy, kneeling, as I do now, made answer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This, then, I ask, my liege; that I and my successors may have and\r\nhold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of\r\nEngland, henceforth while the throne shall last.\xe2\x80\x99 The boon was granted,\r\nas your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four hundred\r\nyears, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even unto this day,\r\nthe head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do.\r\n{3} Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to\r\ngrant to me but this one grace and privilege--to my more than sufficient\r\nreward--and none other, to wit: \xc2\xa0that I and my heirs, for ever, may\r\n_sit_ in the presence of the Majesty of England!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, gravely--giving the\r\naccolade with Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s sword--\xe2\x80\x9crise, and seat thyself. \xc2\xa0Thy petition is\r\ngranted. \xc2\xa0Whilst England remains, and the crown continues, the privilege\r\nshall not lapse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a chair at\r\ntable, observing to himself, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought\r\nme a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied. An I had not\r\nthought of that, I must have had to stand for weeks, till my poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwits are cured.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0After a little, he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I am become a\r\nknight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows! A most odd and strange\r\nposition, truly, for one so matter-of-fact as I. \xc2\xa0I will not laugh--no,\r\nGod forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to me is _real_ to\r\nhim. \xc2\xa0And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it reflects\r\nwith truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0After\r\na pause: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, what if he should call me by my fine title before\r\nfolk!--there\xe2\x80\x99d be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment! \xc2\xa0But\r\nno matter, let him call me what he will, so it please him; I shall be\r\ncontent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. The disappearance of the Prince.\r\n\r\nA heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades. \xc2\xa0The King\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemove these rags.\xe2\x80\x9d--meaning his clothing.\r\n\r\nHendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked him up in\r\nbed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself, ruefully, \xe2\x80\x9cHe hath\r\ntaken my bed again, as before--marry, what shall _I_ do?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The little\r\nKing observed his perplexity, and dissipated it with a word. \xc2\xa0He said,\r\nsleepily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0In a moment more he\r\nwas out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart, he should have been born a king!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Hendon,\r\nadmiringly; \xe2\x80\x9che playeth the part to a marvel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying\r\ncontentedly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lodged worse for seven years; \xe2\x80\x99twould be but ill gratitude to\r\nHim above to find fault with this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped asleep as the dawn appeared. \xc2\xa0Toward noon he rose, uncovered\r\nhis unconscious ward--a section at a time--and took his measure with a\r\nstring. \xc2\xa0The King awoke, just as he had completed his work, complained\r\nof the cold, and asked what he was doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis done, now, my liege,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hendon; \xe2\x80\x9cI have a bit of business\r\noutside, but will presently return; sleep thou again--thou needest it.\r\nThere--let me cover thy head also--thou\xe2\x80\x99lt be warm the sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended. Miles\r\nslipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the course of\r\nthirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear; but tidy, and\r\nsuited to the season of the year. \xc2\xa0He seated himself, and began to\r\noverhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has not the\r\nlong purse one must be content with what a short one may do--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There was a woman in our town, In our town did dwell--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stirred, methinks--I must sing in a less thunderous key; \xe2\x80\x99tis not\r\ngood to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so wearied\r\nout, poor chap . . . This garment--\xe2\x80\x98tis well enough--a stitch here and\r\nanother one there will set it aright. \xc2\xa0This other is better, albeit a\r\nstitch or two will not come amiss in it, likewise . . . _These_ be very\r\ngood and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and dry--an odd new\r\nthing to him, belike, since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare,\r\nwinters and summers the same . . . Would thread were bread, seeing one\r\ngetteth a year\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle\r\nwithout cost, for mere love. \xc2\xa0Now shall I have the demon\xe2\x80\x99s own time to\r\nthread it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he had. \xc2\xa0He did as men have always done, and probably always will\r\ndo, to the end of time--held the needle still, and tried to thrust the\r\nthread through the eye, which is the opposite of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s way. \xc2\xa0Time\r\nand time again the thread missed the mark, going sometimes on one side\r\nof the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the\r\nshaft; but he was patient, having been through these experiences before,\r\nwhen he was soldiering. \xc2\xa0He succeeded at last, and took up the garment\r\nthat had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe inn is paid--the breakfast that is to come, included--and there is\r\nwherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs\r\nfor the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at\r\nHendon Hall--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She loved her hus--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBody o\xe2\x80\x99 me! \xc2\xa0I have driven the needle under my nail! . . . It matters\r\nlittle--\xe2\x80\x98tis not a novelty--yet \xe2\x80\x99tis not a convenience, neither. . . .\r\nWe shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it! Thy troubles will\r\nvanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She loved her husband dearilee, But another man--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese be noble large stitches!\xe2\x80\x9d--holding the garment up and viewing\r\nit admiringly--\xe2\x80\x9cthey have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause\r\nthese small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and\r\nplebeian--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She loved her husband dearilee, But another man he loved she,--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, \xe2\x80\x99tis done--a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought with\r\nexpedition. \xc2\xa0Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him,\r\nand then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark\r\nand--be pleased to rise, my liege!--he answereth not--what ho, my\r\nliege!--of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch, sith\r\nhis slumber is deaf to speech. \xc2\xa0What!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw back the covers--the boy was gone!\r\n\r\nHe stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment; noticed for\r\nthe first time that his ward\xe2\x80\x99s ragged raiment was also missing; then he\r\nbegan to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper. \xc2\xa0At that moment a\r\nservant entered with the breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!\xe2\x80\x9d roared the man of\r\nwar, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter\r\ncould not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and surprise.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youth came\r\nrunning and said it was your worship\xe2\x80\x99s will that the boy come to you\r\nstraight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side. \xc2\xa0I brought him\r\nhither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message, the lad did\r\ngrumble some little for being disturbed \xe2\x80\x98so early,\xe2\x80\x99 as he called it, but\r\nstraightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth, only saying\r\nit had been better manners that your worship came yourself, not sent a\r\nstranger--and so--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so thou\xe2\x80\x99rt a fool!--a fool and easily cozened--hang all thy breed!\r\nYet mayhap no hurt is done. \xc2\xa0Possibly no harm is meant the boy. \xc2\xa0I will\r\ngo fetch him. \xc2\xa0Make the table ready. \xc2\xa0Stay! the coverings of the bed\r\nwere disposed as if one lay beneath them--happened that by accident?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not, good your worship. \xc2\xa0I saw the youth meddle with them--he\r\nthat came for the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThousand deaths!  \xe2\x80\x98Twas done to deceive me--\xe2\x80\x98tis plain \xe2\x80\x99twas done to\r\ngain time. \xc2\xa0Hark ye! \xc2\xa0Was that youth alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll alone, your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCollect thy scattered wits--bethink thee--take time, man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought, the servant said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as the two\r\nstepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking man plunged out\r\nfrom some near place; and just as he was joining them--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _then_?--out with it!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered the impatient Hendon,\r\ninterrupting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I saw no\r\nmore, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a joint that\r\nthe scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all the saints to\r\nwitness that to blame _me_ for that miscarriage were like holding the\r\nunborn babe to judgment for sins com--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of my sight, idiot! \xc2\xa0Thy prating drives me mad! \xc2\xa0Hold! Whither art\r\nflying? \xc2\xa0Canst not bide still an instant? \xc2\xa0Went they toward Southwark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so, your worship--for, as I said before, as to that detestable\r\njoint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt here _yet_! \xc2\xa0And prating still! \xc2\xa0Vanish, lest I throttle thee!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nservitor vanished. \xc2\xa0Hendon followed after him, passed him, and plunged\r\ndown the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis that scurvy\r\nvillain that claimed he was his son. \xc2\xa0I have lost thee, my poor little\r\nmad master--it is a bitter thought--and I had come to love thee so! \xc2\xa0No!\r\nby book and bell, _not_ lost! \xc2\xa0Not lost, for I will ransack the land\r\ntill I find thee again. \xc2\xa0Poor child, yonder is his breakfast--and mine,\r\nbut I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it--speed, speed! that\r\nis the word!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes\r\nupon the Bridge he several times said to himself--clinging to the\r\nthought as if it were a particularly pleasing one--\xe2\x80\x9cHe grumbled, but he\r\n_went_--he went, yes, because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet\r\nlad--he would ne\xe2\x80\x99er have done it for another, I know it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. \xe2\x80\x98Le Roi est mort--vive le Roi.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nToward daylight of the same morning, Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy\r\nsleep and opened his eyes in the dark. \xc2\xa0He lay silent a few moments,\r\ntrying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions, and get some\r\nsort of meaning out of them; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous\r\nbut guarded voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it all, I see it all! \xc2\xa0Now God be thanked, I am indeed awake at\r\nlast! \xc2\xa0Come, joy! vanish, sorrow! \xc2\xa0Ho, Nan! Bet! kick off your straw and\r\nhie ye hither to my side, till I do pour into your unbelieving ears the\r\nwildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to\r\nastonish the soul of man withal! . . . Ho, Nan, I say! \xc2\xa0Bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA dim form appeared at his side, and a voice said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilt deign to deliver thy commands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommands? . . . O, woe is me, I know thy voice! \xc2\xa0Speak thou--who am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou? \xc2\xa0In sooth, yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales; to-day art\r\nthou my most gracious liege, Edward, King of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom buried his head among his pillows, murmuring plaintively--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlack, it was no dream! \xc2\xa0Go to thy rest, sweet sir--leave me to my\r\nsorrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom slept again, and after a time he had this pleasant dream. \xc2\xa0He\r\nthought it was summer, and he was playing, all alone, in the fair meadow\r\ncalled Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s Fields, when a dwarf only a foot high, with long red\r\nwhiskers and a humped back, appeared to him suddenly and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDig by\r\nthat stump.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He did so, and found twelve bright new pennies--wonderful\r\nriches! \xc2\xa0Yet this was not the best of it; for the dwarf said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know thee. \xc2\xa0Thou art a good lad, and a deserving; thy distresses\r\nshall end, for the day of thy reward is come. \xc2\xa0Dig here every seventh\r\nday, and thou shalt find always the same treasure, twelve bright new\r\npennies. Tell none--keep the secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the dwarf vanished, and Tom flew to Offal Court with his prize,\r\nsaying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery night will I give my father a penny; he\r\nwill think I begged it, it will glad his heart, and I shall no more\r\nbe beaten. One penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall\r\nhave; mother, Nan, and Bet the other four. We be done with hunger and\r\nrags, now, done with fears and frets and savage usage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath, but with\r\neyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm; cast four of his pennies into his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s lap and cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are for thee!--all of them, every one!--for thee and Nan and\r\nBet--and honestly come by, not begged nor stolen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt waxeth late--may it please your Majesty to rise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh! that was not the answer he was expecting. \xc2\xa0The dream had snapped\r\nasunder--he was awake.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes--the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was\r\nkneeling by his couch. \xc2\xa0The gladness of the lying dream faded away--the\r\npoor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king. \xc2\xa0The room\r\nwas filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles--the mourning\r\ncolour--and with noble servants of the monarch. \xc2\xa0Tom sat up in bed and\r\ngazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company.\r\n\r\nThe weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after another\r\nknelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his condolences\r\nupon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded. \xc2\xa0In the beginning, a\r\nshirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it to the\r\nFirst Lord of the Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentleman of\r\nthe Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest,\r\nwho passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the\r\nChancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master\r\nof the Wardrobe, who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to\r\nthe Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the\r\nHousehold, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it\r\nto the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took\r\nwhat was left of it and put it on Tom. \xc2\xa0Poor little wondering chap, it\r\nreminded him of passing buckets at a fire.\r\n\r\nEach garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process;\r\nconsequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony; so weary that he felt\r\nan almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose\r\nbegin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter\r\nwas drawing near. \xc2\xa0But he exulted too soon. \xc2\xa0The First Lord of the\r\nBedchamber received the hose and was about to encase Tom\xe2\x80\x99s legs in them,\r\nwhen a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things\r\nback into the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded\r\nlook and a whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to a something connected\r\nwith the hose. \xc2\xa0The Archbishop paled, then flushed, and passed the\r\nhose to the Lord High Admiral, whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The Admiral\r\npassed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, and had hardly breath\r\nenough in his body to ejaculate, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The hose drifted\r\nbackward along the line, to the Chief Steward of the Household, the\r\nConstable of the Tower, Norroy King-at-Arms, the Master of the Wardrobe,\r\nthe Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Third Groom of the\r\nStole, the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, the Second Gentleman of the\r\nBedchamber, the First Lord of the Buckhounds,--accompanied always with\r\nthat amazed and frightened \xe2\x80\x9cSee! see!\xe2\x80\x9d--till they finally reached the\r\nhands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who gazed a moment, with a pallid\r\nface, upon what had caused all this dismay, then hoarsely whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBody of my life, a tag gone from a truss-point!--to the Tower with\r\nthe Head Keeper of the King\xe2\x80\x99s Hose!\xe2\x80\x9d--after which he leaned upon the\r\nshoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to regather his vanished\r\nstrength whilst fresh hose, without any damaged strings to them, were\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nBut all things must have an end, and so in time Tom Canty was in a\r\ncondition to get out of bed. \xc2\xa0The proper official poured water, the\r\nproper official engineered the washing, the proper official stood by\r\nwith a towel, and by-and-by Tom got safely through the purifying stage\r\nand was ready for the services of the Hairdresser-royal. \xc2\xa0When he at\r\nlength emerged from this master\xe2\x80\x99s hands, he was a gracious figure and\r\nas pretty as a girl, in his mantle and trunks of purple satin, and\r\npurple-plumed cap. \xc2\xa0He now moved in state toward his breakfast-room,\r\nthrough the midst of the courtly assemblage; and as he passed, these\r\nfell back, leaving his way free, and dropped upon their knees.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he was conducted, with regal ceremony, attended by his\r\ngreat officers and his guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners bearing gilt\r\nbattle-axes, to the throne-room, where he proceeded to transact business\r\nof state. \xc2\xa0His \xe2\x80\x98uncle,\xe2\x80\x99 Lord Hertford, took his stand by the throne, to\r\nassist the royal mind with wise counsel.\r\n\r\nThe body of illustrious men named by the late King as his executors\r\nappeared, to ask Tom\xe2\x80\x99s approval of certain acts of theirs--rather a\r\nform, and yet not wholly a form, since there was no Protector as yet.\r\n\xc2\xa0The Archbishop of Canterbury made report of the decree of the Council\r\nof Executors concerning the obsequies of his late most illustrious\r\nMajesty, and finished by reading the signatures of the Executors, to\r\nwit: \xc2\xa0the Archbishop of Canterbury; the Lord Chancellor of England;\r\nWilliam Lord St. John; John Lord Russell; Edward Earl of Hertford; John\r\nViscount Lisle; Cuthbert Bishop of Durham--\r\n\r\nTom was not listening--an earlier clause of the document was puzzling\r\nhim. \xc2\xa0At this point he turned and whispered to Lord Hertford--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat day did he say the burial hath been appointed for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sixteenth of the coming month, my liege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a strange folly. \xc2\xa0Will he keep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor chap, he was still new to the customs of royalty; he was used to\r\nseeing the forlorn dead of Offal Court hustled out of the way with a\r\nvery different sort of expedition. \xc2\xa0However, the Lord Hertford set his\r\nmind at rest with a word or two.\r\n\r\nA secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the\r\nmorrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors, and\r\ndesired the King\xe2\x80\x99s assent.\r\n\r\nTom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty will signify consent. \xc2\xa0They come to testify their royal\r\nmasters\xe2\x80\x99 sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your Grace and\r\nthe realm of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom did as he was bidden. \xc2\xa0Another secretary began to read a preamble\r\nconcerning the expenses of the late King\xe2\x80\x99s household, which had amounted\r\nto 28,000 pounds during the preceding six months--a sum so vast that it\r\nmade Tom Canty gasp; he gasped again when the fact appeared that 20,000\r\npounds of this money was still owing and unpaid; {4} and once more when\r\nit appeared that the King\xe2\x80\x99s coffers were about empty, and his twelve\r\nhundred servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them. \xc2\xa0Tom\r\nspoke out, with lively apprehension--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe be going to the dogs, \xe2\x80\x99tis plain.  \xe2\x80\x98Tis meet and necessary that we\r\ntake a smaller house and set the servants at large, sith they be of no\r\nvalue but to make delay, and trouble one with offices that harass the\r\nspirit and shame the soul, they misbecoming any but a doll, that hath\r\nnor brains nor hands to help itself withal. \xc2\xa0I remember me of a small\r\nhouse that standeth over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sharp pressure upon Tom\xe2\x80\x99s arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a\r\nblush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this\r\nstrange speech had been remarked or given concern.\r\n\r\nA secretary made report that forasmuch as the late King had provided in\r\nhis will for conferring the ducal degree upon the Earl of Hertford and\r\nraising his brother, Sir Thomas Seymour, to the peerage, and likewise\r\nHertford\xe2\x80\x99s son to an earldom, together with similar aggrandisements to\r\nother great servants of the Crown, the Council had resolved to hold a\r\nsitting on the 16th of February for the delivering and confirming of\r\nthese honours, and that meantime, the late King not having granted,\r\nin writing, estates suitable to the support of these dignities, the\r\nCouncil, knowing his private wishes in that regard, had thought proper\r\nto grant to Seymour \xe2\x80\x98500 pound lands,\xe2\x80\x99 and to Hertford\xe2\x80\x99s son \xe2\x80\x98800\r\npound lands, and 300 pound of the next bishop\xe2\x80\x99s lands which should fall\r\nvacant,\xe2\x80\x99--his present Majesty being willing. {5}\r\n\r\nTom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of paying the\r\nlate King\xe2\x80\x99s debts first, before squandering all this money, but a\r\ntimely touch upon his arm, from the thoughtful Hertford, saved him\r\nthis indiscretion; wherefore he gave the royal assent, without spoken\r\ncomment, but with much inward discomfort. \xc2\xa0While he sat reflecting a\r\nmoment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering\r\nmiracles, a happy thought shot into his mind: \xc2\xa0why not make his mother\r\nDuchess of Offal Court, and give her an estate? \xc2\xa0But a sorrowful\r\nthought swept it instantly away: he was only a king in name, these grave\r\nveterans and great nobles were his masters; to them his mother was only\r\nthe creature of a diseased mind; they would simply listen to his project\r\nwith unbelieving ears, then send for the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe dull work went tediously on. \xc2\xa0Petitions were read, and\r\nproclamations, patents, and all manner of wordy, repetitious, and\r\nwearisome papers relating to the public business; and at last Tom sighed\r\npathetically and murmured to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIn what have I offended, that the\r\ngood God should take me away from the fields and the free air and the\r\nsunshine, to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xc2\xa0Then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his\r\nshoulder; and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want\r\nof that august factor, the ratifying power. \xc2\xa0Silence ensued around\r\nthe slumbering child, and the sages of the realm ceased from their\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon, Tom had an enjoyable hour, by permission of his\r\nkeepers, Hertford and St. John, with the Lady Elizabeth and the little\r\nLady Jane Grey; though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued\r\nby the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house; and at the\r\nend of the visit his \xe2\x80\x98elder sister\xe2\x80\x99--afterwards the \xe2\x80\x98Bloody Mary\xe2\x80\x99 of\r\nhistory--chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in\r\nhis eyes, its brevity. \xc2\xa0He had a few moments to himself, and then a slim\r\nlad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence, whose\r\nclothing, except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of\r\nblack,--doublet, hose, and all. \xc2\xa0He bore no badge of mourning but a knot\r\nof purple ribbon on his shoulder. \xc2\xa0He advanced hesitatingly, with head\r\nbowed and bare, and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom. Tom sat still\r\nand contemplated him soberly a moment. \xc2\xa0Then he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, lad. \xc2\xa0Who art thou. \xc2\xa0What wouldst have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy rose, and stood at graceful ease, but with an aspect of concern\r\nin his face. \xc2\xa0He said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf a surety thou must remember me, my lord. \xc2\xa0I am thy whipping-boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy _whipping_-boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same, your Grace. \xc2\xa0I am Humphrey--Humphrey Marlow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have\r\nposted him about. \xc2\xa0The situation was delicate. \xc2\xa0What should he\r\ndo?--pretend he knew this lad, and then betray by his every utterance\r\nthat he had never heard of him before? \xc2\xa0No, that would not do. \xc2\xa0An idea\r\ncame to his relief: accidents like this might be likely to happen with\r\nsome frequency, now that business urgencies would often call Hertford\r\nand St. John from his side, they being members of the Council of\r\nExecutors; therefore perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan\r\nhimself to meet the requirements of such emergencies. \xc2\xa0Yes, that would\r\nbe a wise course--he would practise on this boy, and see what sort of\r\nsuccess he might achieve. \xc2\xa0So he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment\r\nor two, and presently said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I seem to remember thee somewhat--but my wit is clogged and dim\r\nwith suffering--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlack, my poor master!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated the whipping-boy, with feeling;\r\nadding, to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth \xe2\x80\x99tis as they said--his mind is gone--alas,\r\npoor soul! \xc2\xa0But misfortune catch me, how am I forgetting! \xc2\xa0They said one\r\nmust not seem to observe that aught is wrong with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut mind it not--I mend apace--a little clue doth often serve to bring\r\nme back again the things and names which had escaped me. \xc2\xa0(And not they,\r\nonly, forsooth, but e\xe2\x80\x99en such as I ne\xe2\x80\x99er heard before--as this lad shall\r\nsee.) \xc2\xa0Give thy business speech.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis matter of small weight, my liege, yet will I touch upon it, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\r\nplease your Grace. \xc2\xa0Two days gone by, when your Majesty faulted thrice\r\nin your Greek--in the morning lessons,--dost remember it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-e-s--methinks I do. \xc2\xa0(It is not much of a lie--an\xe2\x80\x99 I had meddled with\r\nthe Greek at all, I had not faulted simply thrice, but forty times.)\r\nYes, I do recall it, now--go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe master, being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and doltish\r\nwork, did promise that he would soundly whip me for it--and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhip _thee_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, astonished out of his presence of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nshould he whip _thee_ for faults of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, your Grace forgetteth again. \xc2\xa0He always scourgeth me when thou dost\r\nfail in thy lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true--I had forgot. \xc2\xa0Thou teachest me in private--then if I fail,\r\nhe argueth that thy office was lamely done, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my liege, what words are these? \xc2\xa0I, the humblest of thy servants,\r\npresume to teach _thee_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where is thy blame? \xc2\xa0What riddle is this? \xc2\xa0Am I in truth gone mad,\r\nor is it thou? \xc2\xa0Explain--speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, good your Majesty, there\xe2\x80\x99s nought that needeth simplifying.--None\r\nmay visit the sacred person of the Prince of Wales with blows;\r\nwherefore, when he faulteth, \xe2\x80\x99tis I that take them; and meet it is and\r\nright, for that it is mine office and my livelihood.\xe2\x80\x9d {1}\r\n\r\nTom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cLo, it is a\r\nwonderful thing,--a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they have\r\nnot hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me--would\r\nheaven they would!--an\xe2\x80\x99 they will do this thing, I will take my lashings\r\nin mine own person, giving God thanks for the change.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he said\r\naloud--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to the promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this day, and\r\nperadventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season of mourning\r\nthat is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold to come hither\r\nand remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my\r\nbehalf--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the master? \xc2\xa0To save thee thy whipping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, thou dost remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy memory mendeth, thou seest. \xc2\xa0Set thy mind at ease--thy back shall go\r\nunscathed--I will see to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thanks, my good lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy, dropping upon his knee again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayhap I have ventured far enow; and yet--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing Master Humphrey hesitate, Tom encouraged him to go on, saying he\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cin the granting mood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen will I speak it out, for it lieth near my heart. \xc2\xa0Sith thou art\r\nno more Prince of Wales but King, thou canst order matters as thou wilt,\r\nwith none to say thee nay; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt\r\nlonger vex thyself with dreary studies, but wilt burn thy books and\r\nturn thy mind to things less irksome. Then am I ruined, and mine orphan\r\nsisters with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuined? \xc2\xa0Prithee how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy back is my bread, O my gracious liege! if it go idle, I starve. \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthou cease from study mine office is gone thou\xe2\x80\x99lt need no whipping-boy.\r\nDo not turn me away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was touched with this pathetic distress. \xc2\xa0He said, with a right\r\nroyal burst of generosity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscomfort thyself no further, lad. \xc2\xa0Thine office shall be permanent in\r\nthee and thy line for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then he struck the boy a light blow on the\r\nshoulder with the flat of his sword, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cRise, Humphrey Marlow,\r\nHereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England! \xc2\xa0Banish\r\nsorrow--I will betake me to my books again, and study so ill that they\r\nmust in justice treble thy wage, so mightily shall the business of thine\r\noffice be augmented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grateful Humphrey responded fervidly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far surpass\r\nmy most distempered dreams of fortune. \xc2\xa0Now shall I be happy all my\r\ndays, and all the house of Marlow after me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful\r\nto him. \xc2\xa0He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was nothing loath.\r\n\xc2\xa0He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98cure\xe2\x80\x99; for\r\nalways, as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s diseased mind\r\nthe various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal\r\nschool-room and elsewhere about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then\r\nable to \xe2\x80\x98recall\xe2\x80\x99 the circumstances quite clearly. \xc2\xa0At the end of an\r\nhour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information\r\nconcerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he\r\nresolved to draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he\r\nwould give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might\r\ncome, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people.\r\n\xc2\xa0Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with\r\nmore trouble for Tom.\r\n\r\nHe said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some overwrought\r\nreport of the King\xe2\x80\x99s damaged health might have leaked out and got\r\nabroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to\r\ndine in public after a day or two--his wholesome complexion and vigorous\r\nstep, assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and\r\ngrace of demeanour, would more surely quiet the general pulse--in case\r\nany evil rumours _had_ gone about--than any other scheme that could be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nThen the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to the\r\nobservances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather thin\r\ndisguise of \xe2\x80\x98reminding\xe2\x80\x99 him concerning things already known to him; but\r\nto his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help\r\nin this line--he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction, for\r\nHumphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine\r\nin public; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court.\r\nTom kept these facts to himself, however.\r\n\r\nSeeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply a\r\nfew tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far its\r\namendment had progressed. \xc2\xa0The results were happy, here and there, in\r\nspots--spots where Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s tracks remained--and on the whole my lord\r\nwas greatly pleased and encouraged. \xc2\xa0So encouraged was he, indeed, that\r\nhe spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet\r\na little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal--a loss\r\nwhich was of moment yesterday, although of none to-day, since its term\r\nof service ended with our late lord\xe2\x80\x99s life. May it please your Grace to\r\nmake the trial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was at sea--a Great Seal was something which he was totally\r\nunacquainted with. \xc2\xa0After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation he looked up innocently\r\nand asked--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it like, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAlack,\r\nhis wits are flown again!--it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x9d--then he deftly turned the talk to other matters, with the purpose\r\nof sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts--a purpose which\r\neasily succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. Tom as King.\r\n\r\nThe next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains;\r\nand Tom, throned in awful state, received them. \xc2\xa0The splendours of the\r\nscene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but\r\nthe audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the\r\naddresses--wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and\r\nhome-sickness by-and-by. \xc2\xa0Tom said the words which Hertford put into\r\nhis mouth from time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself\r\nsatisfactorily, but he was too new to such things, and too ill at ease\r\nto accomplish more than a tolerable success. \xc2\xa0He looked sufficiently\r\nlike a king, but he was ill able to feel like one. \xc2\xa0He was cordially\r\nglad when the ceremony was ended.\r\n\r\nThe larger part of his day was \xe2\x80\x98wasted\xe2\x80\x99--as he termed it, in his own\r\nmind--in labours pertaining to his royal office. \xc2\xa0Even the two hours\r\ndevoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a\r\nburden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions\r\nand ceremonious observances. \xc2\xa0However, he had a private hour with\r\nhis whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both\r\nentertainment and needful information out of it.\r\n\r\nThe third day of Tom Canty\xe2\x80\x99s kingship came and went much as the others\r\nhad done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way--he felt\r\nless uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his\r\ncircumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the\r\ntime; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and\r\nembarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nBut for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach\r\nwithout serious distress--the dining in public; it was to begin that\r\nday. There were greater matters in the programme--for on that day\r\nhe would have to preside at a council which would take his views and\r\ncommands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign\r\nnations scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too,\r\nHertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector;\r\nother things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to\r\nTom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all\r\nby himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a\r\nmultitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance,--and upon\r\nhis mistakes, if he should be so unlucky as to make any.\r\n\r\nStill, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came. \xc2\xa0It found\r\npoor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he\r\ncould not shake it off. \xc2\xa0The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon\r\nhis hands, and wearied him. \xc2\xa0Once more he felt the sense of captivity\r\nheavy upon him.\r\n\r\nLate in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing\r\nwith the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour\r\nappointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great\r\nofficials and courtiers.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become\r\ninterested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the\r\npalace gates--and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart\r\nto take part in person in its stir and freedom--saw the van of a hooting\r\nand shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest\r\nand poorest degree approaching from up the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would I knew what \xe2\x80\x99tis about!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with all a boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncuriosity in such happenings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art the King!\xe2\x80\x9d solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I your Grace\xe2\x80\x99s leave to act?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO blithely, yes! \xc2\xa0O gladly, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to\r\nhimself with a lively sense of satisfaction, \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, being a king is\r\nnot all dreariness--it hath its compensations and conveniences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with\r\nthe order--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its\r\nmovement. \xc2\xa0By the King\xe2\x80\x99s command!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing\r\nsteel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front\r\nof the multitude. \xc2\xa0A messenger returned, to report that the crowd were\r\nfollowing a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes\r\ncommitted against the peace and dignity of the realm.\r\n\r\nDeath--and a violent death--for these poor unfortunates! \xc2\xa0The thought\r\nwrung Tom\xe2\x80\x99s heart-strings. \xc2\xa0The spirit of compassion took control of\r\nhim, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of\r\nthe offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals\r\nhad inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the\r\nscaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned.\r\n\xc2\xa0His concern made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the\r\nfalse shadow of a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had\r\nblurted out the command--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring them here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but\r\nobserving that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or\r\nthe waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter. \xc2\xa0The\r\npage, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance\r\nand retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command. \xc2\xa0Tom\r\nexperienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating\r\nadvantages of the kingly office. He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cTruly it is like\r\nwhat I was used to feel when I read the old priest\xe2\x80\x99s tales, and did\r\nimagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do this, do that,\xe2\x80\x99 whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was\r\nannounced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was\r\nquickly half-filled with noble folk and finery. \xc2\xa0But Tom was hardly\r\nconscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so\r\nintensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter. \xc2\xa0He seated\r\nhimself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the\r\ndoor with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the\r\ncompany forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public\r\nbusiness and court gossip one with another.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the measured tread of military men was heard\r\napproaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an\r\nunder-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king\xe2\x80\x99s guard. \xc2\xa0The civil\r\nofficer knelt before Tom, then stood aside; the three doomed persons\r\nknelt, also, and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair. \xc2\xa0Tom scanned the prisoners curiously. Something about the dress\r\nor appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him.  \xe2\x80\x9cMethinks\r\nI have seen this man ere now . . . but the when or the where fail\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d--Such was Tom\xe2\x80\x99s thought. Just then the man glanced quickly up and\r\nquickly dropped his face again, not being able to endure the awful port\r\nof sovereignty; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was\r\nsufficient. \xc2\xa0He said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cNow is the matter clear; this is the\r\nstranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames, and saved his life,\r\nthat windy, bitter, first day of the New Year--a brave good deed--pity\r\nhe hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case . . . I\r\nhave not forgot the day, neither the hour; by reason that an hour after,\r\nupon the stroke of eleven, I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer\r\nCanty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that\r\nwent before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by\r\ncomparison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence\r\nfor a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood sir, what is this man\xe2\x80\x99s offence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer knelt, and answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring\r\nrescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing was proven upon him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost clearly, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom sighed, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him away--he hath earned his death.  \xe2\x80\x98Tis a pity, for he was a\r\nbrave heart--na--na, I mean he hath the _look_ of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy, and wrung\r\nthem despairingly, at the same time appealing imploringly to the \xe2\x80\x98King\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin broken and terrified phrases--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO my lord the King, an\xe2\x80\x99 thou canst pity the lost, have pity upon me! \xc2\xa0I\r\nam innocent--neither hath that wherewith I am charged been more than\r\nbut lamely proved--yet I speak not of that; the judgment is gone forth\r\nagainst me and may not suffer alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a\r\nboon, for my doom is more than I can bear. A grace, a grace, my lord the\r\nKing! in thy royal compassion grant my prayer--give commandment that I\r\nbe hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was amazed. \xc2\xa0This was not the outcome he had looked for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdds my life, a strange _boon_! \xc2\xa0Was it not the fate intended thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO good my liege, not so! \xc2\xa0It is ordered that I be _boiled alive_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from his\r\nchair. \xc2\xa0As soon as he could recover his wits he cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave thy wish, poor soul! an\xe2\x80\x99 thou had poisoned a hundred men thou\r\nshouldst not suffer so miserable a death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate\r\nexpressions of gratitude--ending with--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ever thou shouldst know misfortune--which God forefend!--may thy\r\ngoodness to me this day be remembered and requited!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nferocious doom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the law, your Grace--for poisoners. \xc2\xa0In Germany coiners be boiled\r\nto death in _oil_--not cast in of a sudden, but by a rope let down into\r\nthe oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet, then the legs, then--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom, covering\r\nhis eyes with his hands to shut out the picture.  \xe2\x80\x9cI beseech your good\r\nlordship that order be taken to change this law--oh, let no more poor\r\ncreatures be visited with its tortures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Earl\xe2\x80\x99s face showed profound gratification, for he was a man of\r\nmerciful and generous impulses--a thing not very common with his class\r\nin that fierce age. \xc2\xa0He said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese your Grace\xe2\x80\x99s noble words have sealed its doom. \xc2\xa0History will\r\nremember it to the honour of your royal house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him a sign\r\nto wait; then he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood sir, I would look into this matter further. \xc2\xa0The man has said his\r\ndeed was but lamely proved. \xc2\xa0Tell me what thou knowest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the King\xe2\x80\x99s grace please, it did appear upon the trial that this\r\nman entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay\r\nsick--three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning, and\r\ntwo say it was some minutes later--the sick man being alone at the time,\r\nand sleeping--and presently the man came forth again and went his\r\nway. \xc2\xa0The sick man died within the hour, being torn with spasms and\r\nretchings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid any see the poison given? \xc2\xa0Was poison found?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, no, my liege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how doth one know there was poison given at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with such\r\nsymptoms but by poison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeighty evidence, this, in that simple age. \xc2\xa0Tom recognised its\r\nformidable nature, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor knoweth his trade--belike they were right. \xc2\xa0The matter hath\r\nan ill-look for this poor man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet was not this all, your Majesty; there is more and worse. Many\r\ntestified that a witch, since gone from the village, none know whither,\r\ndid foretell, and speak it privately in their ears, that the sick\r\nman _would die by poison_--and more, that a stranger would give it--a\r\nstranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb; and\r\nsurely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill. \xc2\xa0Please your\r\nMajesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due,\r\nseeing it was _foretold_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day. \xc2\xa0Tom\r\nfelt that the thing was settled; if evidence was worth anything, this\r\npoor fellow\xe2\x80\x99s guilt was proved. \xc2\xa0Still he offered the prisoner a chance,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou canst say aught in thy behalf, speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNought that will avail, my King. \xc2\xa0I am innocent, yet cannot I make\r\nit appear. \xc2\xa0I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in\r\nIslington that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I\r\nwas above a league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more,\r\nmy King, for I could show, that whilst they say I was _taking_ life, I\r\nwas _saving_ it. \xc2\xa0A drowning boy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace! \xc2\xa0Sheriff, name the day the deed was done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt ten in the morning, or some minutes later, the first day of the New\r\nYear, most illustrious--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the prisoner go free--it is the King\xe2\x80\x99s will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother blush followed this unregal outburst, and he covered his\r\nindecorum as well as he could by adding--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle, hare-brained\r\nevidence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage. \xc2\xa0It was not\r\nadmiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom, for the\r\npropriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing\r\nwhich few there would have felt justified in either admitting or\r\nadmiring--no, the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which\r\nTom had displayed. \xc2\xa0Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no mad king--he hath his wits sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sanely he put his questions--how like his former natural self was\r\nthis abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be thanked, his infirmity is spent! \xc2\xa0This is no weakling, but a\r\nking. \xc2\xa0He hath borne himself like to his own father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe air being filled with applause, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s ear necessarily caught a\r\nlittle of it. \xc2\xa0The effect which this had upon him was to put him\r\ngreatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very gratifying\r\nsensations.\r\n\r\nHowever, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant\r\nthoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief\r\nthe woman and the little girl could have been about; so, by his command,\r\nthe two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that these have done?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired of the sheriff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly\r\nproven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that\r\nthey be hanged. \xc2\xa0They sold themselves to the devil--such is their\r\ncrime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom shuddered. \xc2\xa0He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked\r\nthing. \xc2\xa0Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding\r\nhis curiosity for all that; so he asked--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was this done?--and when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom shuddered again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was there present?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly these two, your grace--and _that other_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave these confessed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, not so, sire--they do deny it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen prithee, how was it known?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this\r\nbred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified\r\nit. \xc2\xa0In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so\r\nobtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the\r\nregion round about. \xc2\xa0Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and\r\nsooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it,\r\nsith all had suffered by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertes this is a serious matter.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Tom turned this dark piece of\r\nscoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuffered the woman also by the storm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of\r\nthe wisdom of this question. \xc2\xa0The sheriff, however, saw nothing\r\nconsequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver. Her\r\nhabitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMethinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought. She\r\nhad been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid\r\nher soul, and her child\xe2\x80\x99s, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she\r\nknoweth not what she doth, therefore sinneth not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom once more, and one\r\nindividual murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 the King be mad himself, according to report,\r\nthen is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I\r\nwot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat age hath the child?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine years, please your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself,\r\nmy lord?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tom, turning to a learned judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty\r\nmatter, good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope\r\nwith the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders. \xc2\xa0The\r\n_Devil_ may buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto,\r\nbut not an Englishman--in this latter case the contract would be null\r\nand void.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English\r\nlaw denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nTom, with honest heat.\r\n\r\nThis novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored\r\naway in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noriginality as well as progress toward mental health.\r\n\r\nThe elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords with an excited interest and a growing hope. \xc2\xa0Tom noticed this,\r\nand it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and\r\nunfriended situation. \xc2\xa0Presently he asked--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow wrought they to bring the storm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_By pulling off their stockings_, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat. He\r\nsaid, eagerly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is wonderful! \xc2\xa0Hath it always this dread effect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways, my liege--at least if the woman desire it, and utter the\r\nneedful words, either in her mind or with her tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExert thy power--I would see a storm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and\r\na general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place--all of\r\nwhich was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed\r\ncataclysm. \xc2\xa0Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s face, he\r\nadded, excitedly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear--thou shalt be blameless. \xc2\xa0More--thou shalt go free--none\r\nshall touch thee. \xc2\xa0Exert thy power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my lord the King, I have it not--I have been falsely accused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy fears stay thee. \xc2\xa0Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm.\r\n\xc2\xa0Make a storm--it mattereth not how small a one--I require nought great\r\nor harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite--do this and thy life is\r\nspared--thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had\r\nno power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her child\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nalone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommand so precious a grace might be acquired.\r\n\r\nTom urged--the woman still adhered to her declarations. \xc2\xa0Finally he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the woman hath said true. \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 _my_ mother were in her place\r\nand gifted with the devil\xe2\x80\x99s functions, she had not stayed a moment to\r\ncall her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my\r\nforfeit life were the price she got! \xc2\xa0It is argument that other\r\nmothers are made in like mould. \xc2\xa0Thou art free, goodwife--thou and thy\r\nchild--for I do think thee innocent. \xc2\xa0_Now_ thou\xe2\x80\x99st nought to fear,\r\nbeing pardoned--pull off thy stockings!--an\xe2\x80\x99 thou canst make me a storm,\r\nthou shalt be rich!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to\r\nobey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred\r\nby apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided\r\ndiscomfort and uneasiness. \xc2\xa0The woman stripped her own feet and her\r\nlittle girl\xe2\x80\x99s also, and plainly did her best to reward the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure and a\r\ndisappointment. \xc2\xa0Tom sighed, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is departed\r\nout of thee. \xc2\xa0Go thy way in peace; and if it return to thee at any time,\r\nforget me not, but fetch me a storm.\xe2\x80\x9d {13}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. The State Dinner.\r\n\r\nThe dinner hour drew near--yet strangely enough, the thought brought\r\nbut slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror. \xc2\xa0The morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexperiences had wonderfully built up his confidence; the poor little\r\nash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret, after four\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 habit, than a mature person could have become in a full month. \xc2\xa0A\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more\r\nstrikingly illustrated.\r\n\r\nLet us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a\r\nglance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the\r\nimposing occasion. \xc2\xa0It is a spacious apartment, with gilded pillars\r\nand pilasters, and pictured walls and ceilings. \xc2\xa0At the door stand tall\r\nguards, as rigid as statues, dressed in rich and picturesque costumes,\r\nand bearing halberds. \xc2\xa0In a high gallery which runs all around the place\r\nis a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes,\r\nin brilliant attire. \xc2\xa0In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform,\r\nis Tom\xe2\x80\x99s table. Now let the ancient chronicler speak:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him another\r\nbearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times\r\nwith the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after\r\nkneeling again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod\r\nagain, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and bread; when they have\r\nkneeled as the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the\r\ntable, they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first;\r\nat last come two nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife,\r\nwho, after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful\r\nmanner, approach and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe\r\nas if the King had been present.\xe2\x80\x9d {6}\r\n\r\nSo end the solemn preliminaries. \xc2\xa0Now, far down the echoing corridors\r\nwe hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, \xe2\x80\x9cPlace for the King!\r\n\xc2\xa0Way for the King\xe2\x80\x99s most excellent majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0These sounds are momently\r\nrepeated--they grow nearer and nearer--and presently, almost in our\r\nfaces, the martial note peals and the cry rings out, \xe2\x80\x9cWay for the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xc2\xa0At this instant the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door,\r\nwith a measured march. Let the chronicler speak again:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly\r\ndressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between two, one of\r\nwhich carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of State in a red\r\nscabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next\r\ncomes the King himself--whom, upon his appearing, twelve trumpets and\r\nmany drums salute with a great burst of welcome, whilst all in the\r\ngalleries rise in their places, crying \xe2\x80\x98God save the King!\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa0After him\r\ncome nobles attached to his person, and on his right and left march his\r\nguard of honour, his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was all fine and pleasant. \xc2\xa0Tom\xe2\x80\x99s pulse beat high, and a glad light\r\nwas in his eye. \xc2\xa0He bore himself right gracefully, and all the more\r\nso because he was not thinking of how he was doing it, his mind being\r\ncharmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him--and\r\nbesides, nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful\r\nclothes after he has grown a little used to them--especially if he is\r\nfor the moment unconscious of them. Tom remembered his instructions, and\r\nacknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head,\r\nand a courteous \xe2\x80\x9cI thank ye, my good people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it without\r\nthe least embarrassment; for to eat with one\xe2\x80\x99s cap on was the one\r\nsolitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon\r\ncommon ground, neither party having any advantage over the other in the\r\nmatter of old familiarity with it. \xc2\xa0The pageant broke up and grouped\r\nitself picturesquely, and remained bareheaded.\r\n\r\nNow to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered,--\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ntallest and mightiest men in England, they being carefully selected in\r\nthis regard\xe2\x80\x9d--but we will let the chronicler tell about it:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in scarlet, with\r\ngolden roses upon their backs; and these went and came, bringing in each\r\nturn a course of dishes, served in plate. \xc2\xa0These dishes were received\r\nby a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and placed upon\r\nthe table, while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the\r\nparticular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds\r\nof eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an\r\ninterest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly\r\nexplosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about\r\nthe place. \xc2\xa0He was careful not to hurry, and equally careful not to do\r\nanything whatever for himself, but wait till the proper official knelt\r\ndown and did it for him. \xc2\xa0He got through without a mistake--flawless and\r\nprecious triumph.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his\r\nbright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles,\r\nrolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen\r\nthe worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad\r\nto endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself\r\nfree from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. Foo-foo the First.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge,\r\nkeeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and\r\nexpecting to overtake them presently. \xc2\xa0He was disappointed in this,\r\nhowever. \xc2\xa0By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the\r\nway through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as\r\nto how to proceed. \xc2\xa0Still, he continued his efforts as best he\r\ncould during the rest of the day. \xc2\xa0Nightfall found him leg-weary,\r\nhalf-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so\r\nhe supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early\r\nstart in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search. \xc2\xa0As he lay\r\nthinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus: \xc2\xa0The boy would\r\nescape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go\r\nback to London and seek his former haunts? \xc2\xa0No, he would not do that,\r\nhe would avoid recapture. What, then, would he do? \xc2\xa0Never having had a\r\nfriend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would\r\nnaturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not\r\nrequire him to go toward London and danger. \xc2\xa0He would strike for Hendon\r\nHall, that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound\r\nand there he might expect to find him. \xc2\xa0Yes, the case was plain to\r\nHendon--he must lose no more time in Southwark, but move at once through\r\nKent, toward Monk\xe2\x80\x99s Holm, searching the wood and inquiring as he went.\r\n\xc2\xa0Let us return to the vanished little King now.\r\n\r\nThe ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw \xe2\x80\x98about to join\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close\r\nbehind them and followed their steps. \xc2\xa0He said nothing. His left arm was\r\nin a sling, and he wore a large green patch over his left eye; he limped\r\nslightly, and used an oaken staff as a support. \xc2\xa0The youth led the King\r\na crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the\r\nhigh road beyond. \xc2\xa0The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop\r\nhere--it was Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon. \xc2\xa0He\r\nwould not endure such insolence; he would stop where he was. \xc2\xa0The youth\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou\xe2\x80\x99lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder?\r\n\xc2\xa0So be it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King\xe2\x80\x99s manner changed at once. \xc2\xa0He cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWounded? \xc2\xa0And who hath dared to do it? \xc2\xa0But that is apart; lead on,\r\nlead on! \xc2\xa0Faster, sirrah! \xc2\xa0Art shod with lead? \xc2\xa0Wounded, is he? \xc2\xa0Now\r\nthough the doer of it be a duke\xe2\x80\x99s son he shall rue it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily traversed.\r\nThe youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking in the ground,\r\nwith a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way into the forest,\r\nwatching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals; they were\r\nevidently guides to the point he was aiming at. \xc2\xa0By-and-by an open place\r\nwas reached, where were the charred remains of a farm-house, and near\r\nthem a barn which was falling to ruin and decay. \xc2\xa0There was no sign of\r\nlife anywhere, and utter silence prevailed. \xc2\xa0The youth entered the barn,\r\nthe King following eagerly upon his heels. \xc2\xa0No one there! The King shot\r\na surprised and suspicious glance at the youth, and asked--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA mocking laugh was his answer. \xc2\xa0The King was in a rage in a moment; he\r\nseized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth\r\nwhen another mocking laugh fell upon his ear. \xc2\xa0It was from the lame\r\nruffian who had been following at a distance. The King turned and said\r\nangrily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho art thou? \xc2\xa0What is thy business here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave thy foolery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cand quiet thyself. \xc2\xa0My disguise is\r\nnone so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art not my father. \xc2\xa0I know thee not. \xc2\xa0I am the King. \xc2\xa0If thou hast\r\nhid my servant, find him for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou\r\nhast done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee; \xc2\xa0but if thou\r\nprovoke me, I must. \xc2\xa0Thy prating doth no harm here, where there are\r\nno ears that need to mind thy follies; yet it is well to practise thy\r\ntongue to wary speech, that it may do no hurt when our quarters change.\r\n\xc2\xa0I have done a murder, and may not tarry at home--neither shalt thou,\r\nseeing I need thy service. \xc2\xa0My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is\r\nHobbs--John Hobbs; thine is Jack--charge thy memory accordingly. \xc2\xa0Now,\r\nthen, speak. \xc2\xa0Where is thy mother? \xc2\xa0Where are thy sisters? \xc2\xa0They came\r\nnot to the place appointed--knowest thou whither they went?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King answered sullenly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble me not with these riddles. \xc2\xa0My mother is dead; my sisters are\r\nin the palace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King would have\r\nassaulted him, but Canty--or Hobbs, as he now called himself--prevented\r\nhim, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret him.\r\nSit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat,\r\nanon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the King\r\nremoved himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company.\r\n\xc2\xa0He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn, where\r\nhe found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw. \xc2\xa0He lay down\r\nhere, drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed\r\nin thinking. \xc2\xa0He had many griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost\r\ninto forgetfulness by the supreme one, the loss of his father. \xc2\xa0To\r\nthe rest of the world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and\r\nsuggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand\r\ndealt scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only\r\nsensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance that\r\nwas all gentleness and affection. \xc2\xa0He called to mind a long succession\r\nof loving passages between his father and himself, and dwelt fondly upon\r\nthem, his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that\r\npossessed his heart. As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with\r\nhis troubles, sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable time--he could not tell how long--his senses\r\nstruggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes\r\nvaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he noted a\r\nmurmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof. A snug sense\r\nof comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken, the next moment,\r\nby a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter. \xc2\xa0It startled him\r\ndisagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption\r\nproceeded. \xc2\xa0A grim and unsightly picture met his eye. \xc2\xa0A bright fire was\r\nburning in the middle of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and\r\naround it, and lit weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the\r\nmotliest company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he\r\nhad ever read or dreamed of. \xc2\xa0There were huge stalwart men, brown\r\nwith exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there were\r\nmiddle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly clad; there\r\nwere blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones,\r\nwith wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with running sores peeping\r\nfrom ineffectual wrappings; there was a villain-looking pedlar with\r\nhis pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker, and a barber-surgeon, with the\r\nimplements of their trades; some of the females were hardly-grown girls,\r\nsome were at prime, some were old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud,\r\nbrazen, foul-mouthed; and all soiled and slatternly; there were three\r\nsore-faced babies; there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings\r\nabout their necks, whose office was to lead the blind.\r\n\r\nThe night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy was\r\nbeginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A general\r\ncry broke forth--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the patches\r\nthat sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard which\r\nrecited the cause of his calamity. \xc2\xa0Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself\r\nof his timber leg and took his place, upon sound and healthy limbs,\r\nbeside his fellow-rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty,\r\nand were reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of each stanza, in\r\na rousing chorus. \xc2\xa0By the time the last stanza was reached, the\r\nhalf-drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch, that everybody joined\r\nin and sang it clear through from the beginning, producing a volume of\r\nvillainous sound that made the rafters quake. \xc2\xa0These were the inspiring\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bien Darkman\xe2\x80\x99s then, Bouse Mort and Ken, The bien Coves bings awast, On\r\nChates to trine by Rome Coves dine For his long lib at last. Bing\xe2\x80\x99d out\r\nbien Morts and toure, and toure, Bing out of the Rome vile bine, And\r\ntoure the Cove that cloy\xe2\x80\x99d your duds, Upon the Chates to trine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(From\xe2\x80\x99The English Rogue.\xe2\x80\x99 London, 1665.)\r\n\r\nConversation followed; not in the thieves\xe2\x80\x99 dialect of the song, for that\r\nwas only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening. \xc2\xa0In the\r\ncourse of it, it appeared that \xe2\x80\x98John Hobbs\xe2\x80\x99 was not altogether a new\r\nrecruit, but had trained in the gang at some former time. \xc2\xa0His later\r\nhistory was called for, and when he said he had \xe2\x80\x98accidentally\xe2\x80\x99 killed a\r\nman, considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the\r\nman was a priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with\r\neverybody. \xc2\xa0Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new ones were\r\nproud to shake him by the hand. \xc2\xa0He was asked why he had \xe2\x80\x99tarried away\r\nso many months.\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa0He answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLondon is better than the country, and safer, these late years, the\r\nlaws be so bitter and so diligently enforced. \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 I had not had that\r\naccident, I had stayed there. \xc2\xa0I had resolved to stay, and never more\r\nventure country-wards--but the accident has ended that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe inquired how many persons the gang numbered now. \xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x98ruffler,\xe2\x80\x99 or\r\nchief, answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and\r\nmaunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. {7} \xc2\xa0Most are\r\nhere, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We follow\r\nat dawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me. \xc2\xa0Where may he be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a delicate\r\ntaste. He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about midsummer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and brave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was he, truly. \xc2\xa0Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet, but absent on\r\nthe eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none\r\never seeing her drunk above four days in the seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was ever strict--I remember it well--a goodly wench and worthy\r\nall commendation. \xc2\xa0Her mother was more free and less particular; a\r\ntroublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above\r\nthe common.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe lost her through it. \xc2\xa0Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of\r\nfortune-telling begot for her at last a witch\xe2\x80\x99s name and fame. The\r\nlaw roasted her to death at a slow fire. \xc2\xa0It did touch me to a sort of\r\ntenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot--cursing and reviling\r\nall the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked\r\nupward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about\r\nher old gray head--cursing them! why an\xe2\x80\x99 thou should\xe2\x80\x99st live a thousand\r\nyears thoud\xe2\x80\x99st never hear so masterful a cursing. \xc2\xa0Alack, her art died\r\nwith her. \xc2\xa0There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true\r\nblasphemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general\r\ndepression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened\r\noutcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able to\r\nfeel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and\r\nunder peculiarly favouring circumstances--as in cases like to this, for\r\ninstance, when genius and culture depart and leave no heir. \xc2\xa0However, a\r\ndeep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave any others of our friends fared hardly?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hobbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome--yes. \xc2\xa0Particularly new comers--such as small husbandmen turned\r\nshiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from\r\nthem to be changed to sheep ranges. \xc2\xa0They begged, and were whipped at\r\nthe cart\xe2\x80\x99s tail, naked from the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set\r\nin the stocks to be pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and\r\ndeprived of an ear; they begged a third time--poor devils, what else\r\ncould they do?--and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then\r\nsold for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged.  \xe2\x80\x98Tis\r\na brief tale, and quickly told. \xc2\xa0Others of us have fared less hardly.\r\nStand forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge--show your adornments!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing their\r\nbacks, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash; one turned\r\nup his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been; another\r\nshowed a brand upon his shoulder--the letter V--and a mutilated ear; the\r\nthird said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and\r\nkids--now am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the wife\r\nand kids are gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in--in the other\r\nplace--but the kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in _England_!\r\n\xc2\xa0My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick;\r\none of these died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for\r\na witch, whilst my babes looked on and wailed. \xc2\xa0English law!--up,\r\nall, with your cups!--now all together and with a cheer!--drink to the\r\nmerciful English law that delivered _her_ from the English hell! \xc2\xa0Thank\r\nyou, mates, one and all. \xc2\xa0I begged, from house to house--I and the\r\nwife--bearing with us the hungry kids--but it was crime to be hungry in\r\nEngland--so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns. \xc2\xa0Drink\r\nye all again to the merciful English law!--for its lash drank deep of my\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s blood and its blessed deliverance came quick. \xc2\xa0She lies there, in\r\nthe potter\xe2\x80\x99s field, safe from all harms. \xc2\xa0And the kids--well, whilst\r\nthe law lashed me from town to town, they starved. Drink, lads--only\r\na drop--a drop to the poor kids, that never did any creature harm.\r\n\xc2\xa0I begged again--begged, for a crust, and got the stocks and lost an\r\near--see, here bides the stump; I begged again, and here is the stump\r\nof the other to keep me minded of it. And still I begged again, and was\r\nsold for a slave--here on my cheek under this stain, if I washed it off,\r\nye might see the red S the branding-iron left there! \xc2\xa0A _slave_! \xc2\xa0Do\r\nyou understand that word? \xc2\xa0An English _slave_!--that is he that stands\r\nbefore ye. \xc2\xa0I have run from my master, and when I am found--the heavy\r\ncurse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it!--I\r\nshall hang!\xe2\x80\x9d {1}\r\n\r\nA ringing voice came through the murky air--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt _not_!--and this day the end of that law is come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching\r\nhurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed, a\r\ngeneral explosion of inquiries broke out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it? \xc2\xa0_What_ is it? \xc2\xa0Who art thou, manikin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and\r\nquestioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Edward, King of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly of\r\ndelight in the excellence of the joke. \xc2\xa0The King was stung. \xc2\xa0He said\r\nsharply--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal boon I\r\nhave promised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was lost in\r\na whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations.  \xe2\x80\x98John Hobbs\xe2\x80\x99 made\r\nseveral attempts to make himself heard above the din, and at last\r\nsucceeded--saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad--mind him not--he\r\nthinketh he _is_ the King.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ the King,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edward, turning toward him, \xe2\x80\x9cas thou shalt know\r\nto thy cost, in good time. \xc2\xa0Thou hast confessed a murder--thou shalt\r\nswing for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Thou\xe2\x80\x99lt_ betray me?--_thou_? \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 I get my hands upon thee--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut-tut!\xe2\x80\x9d said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save the\r\nKing, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chast respect for neither Kings _nor_ Rufflers? \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 thou insult my\r\npresence so again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hang thee up myself.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then he said to his\r\nMajesty, \xe2\x80\x9cThou must make no threats against thy mates, lad; and thou\r\nmust guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere. \xc2\xa0_Be king_, if\r\nit please thy mad humour, but be not harmful in it. \xc2\xa0Sink the title thou\r\nhast uttered--\xe2\x80\x98tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but\r\nnone among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving\r\nand loyal hearts, in that regard. \xc2\xa0Note if I speak truth. \xc2\xa0Now--all\r\ntogether:  \xe2\x80\x98Long live Edward, King of England!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the\r\ncrazy building vibrated to the sound. \xc2\xa0The little King\xe2\x80\x99s face lighted\r\nwith pleasure for an instant, and he slightly inclined his head, and\r\nsaid with grave simplicity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, my good people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment.\r\nWhen something like quiet was presently come again, the Ruffler said,\r\nfirmly, but with an accent of good nature--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrop it, boy, \xe2\x80\x99tis not wise, nor well. \xc2\xa0Humour thy fancy, if thou must,\r\nbut choose some other title.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tinker shrieked out a suggestion--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe title \xe2\x80\x99took,\xe2\x80\x99 at once, every throat responded, and a roaring shout\r\nwent up, of--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!\xe2\x80\x9d followed by\r\nhootings, cat-calls, and peals of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHale him forth, and crown him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobe him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSceptre him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrone him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost before the\r\npoor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin,\r\nrobed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a barrel, and sceptred with\r\nthe tinker\xe2\x80\x99s soldering-iron. \xc2\xa0Then all flung themselves upon their\r\nknees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking\r\nsupplications, whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and\r\nragged sleeves and aprons--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe gracious to us, O sweet King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of\r\nsovereignty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat the\r\ndirt and be ennobled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children\xe2\x80\x99s children may tell of\r\nthy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the humorous tinker made the \xe2\x80\x98hit\xe2\x80\x99 of the evening and carried off\r\nthe honours. \xc2\xa0Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King\xe2\x80\x99s foot, and was\r\nindignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste\r\nover the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying\r\nit must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he\r\nshould make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to\r\nview at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight. \xc2\xa0He made himself so\r\nkillingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy\r\nrabble.\r\n\r\nTears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; and\r\nthe thought in his heart was, \xe2\x80\x9cHad I offered them a deep wrong they\r\ncould not be more cruel--yet have I proffered nought but to do them a\r\nkindness--and it is thus they use me for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. The Prince with the Tramps.\r\n\r\nThe troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward on\r\ntheir march. \xc2\xa0There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy ground under\r\nfoot, and a winter chill in the air. \xc2\xa0All gaiety was gone from the\r\ncompany; some were sullen and silent, some were irritable and petulant,\r\nnone were gentle-humoured, all were thirsty.\r\n\r\nThe Ruffler put \xe2\x80\x98Jack\xe2\x80\x99 in Hugo\xe2\x80\x99s charge, with some brief instructions,\r\nand commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone; he\r\nalso warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat.\r\nThe troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve. \xc2\xa0They\r\ngrew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and\r\ninsult passengers along the highway. \xc2\xa0This showed that they were awaking\r\nto an appreciation of life and its joys once more. \xc2\xa0The dread in which\r\ntheir sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them\r\nthe road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing\r\nto talk back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full\r\nview of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that\r\nthey did not take the hedges, too.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home\r\nwhile the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to\r\nfurnish a breakfast for them. \xc2\xa0They chucked the housewife and her\r\ndaughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands, and\r\nmade coarse jests about them, accompanied with insulting epithets and\r\nbursts of horse-laughter. \xc2\xa0They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer\r\nand his sons, kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously\r\nwhen a good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of\r\nthe daughters who resented some of their familiarities. \xc2\xa0When they took\r\ntheir leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the\r\nheads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a halt behind\r\na hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village. \xc2\xa0An hour was allowed\r\nfor rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village\r\nat different points to ply their various trades--\xe2\x80\x98Jack\xe2\x80\x99 was sent with\r\nHugo. \xc2\xa0They wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching\r\nfor opportunities to do a stroke of business, but finding none--so he\r\nfinally said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see nought to steal; it is a paltry place. \xc2\xa0Wherefore we will beg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_We_, forsooth! \xc2\xa0Follow thy trade--it befits thee. \xc2\xa0But _I_ will not\r\nbeg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou\xe2\x80\x99lt not beg!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hugo, eyeing the King with surprise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrithee, since when hast thou reformed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean? \xc2\xa0Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? \xc2\xa0Thou idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare thy compliments--thy stock will last the longer. \xc2\xa0Thy father says\r\nthou hast begged all thy days. \xc2\xa0Mayhap he lied. Peradventure you will\r\neven make so bold as to _say_ he lied,\xe2\x80\x9d scoffed Hugo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim _you_ call my father? \xc2\xa0Yes, he lied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, play not thy merry game of madman so far, mate; use it for thy\r\namusement, not thy hurt. \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 I tell him this, he will scorch thee\r\nfinely for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave thyself the trouble. \xc2\xa0I will tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not admire thy judgment.\r\nBone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life, without going\r\nout of one\xe2\x80\x99s way to invite them. \xc2\xa0But a truce to these matters; _I_\r\nbelieve your father. \xc2\xa0I doubt not he can lie; I doubt not he _doth_\r\nlie, upon occasion, for the best of us do that; but there is no occasion\r\nhere. \xc2\xa0A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for\r\nnought. \xc2\xa0But come; sith it is thy humour to give over begging,\r\nwherewithal shall we busy ourselves? \xc2\xa0With robbing kitchens?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King said, impatiently--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done with this folly--you weary me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHugo replied, with temper--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it. But I\r\nwill tell you what you _will_ do. \xc2\xa0You will play decoy whilst _I_ beg.\r\nRefuse, an\xe2\x80\x99 you think you may venture!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said,\r\ninterrupting--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace! \xc2\xa0Here comes one with a kindly face. \xc2\xa0Now will I fall down in\r\na fit. \xc2\xa0When the stranger runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon\r\nyour knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as all the devils of misery\r\nwere in your belly, and say, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir, it is my poor afflicted brother,\r\nand we be friendless; o\xe2\x80\x99 God\xe2\x80\x99s name cast through your merciful eyes one\r\npitiful look upon a sick, forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow\r\none little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready\r\nto perish!\xe2\x80\x99--and mind you, keep you _on_ wailing, and abate not till we\r\nbilk him of his penny, else shall you rue it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his eyes, and\r\nreel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at hand, down he\r\nsprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to writhe and wallow in\r\nthe dirt, in seeming agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dear, O dear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the benevolent stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cO poor soul, poor\r\nsoul, how he doth suffer! \xc2\xa0There--let me help thee up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely gentleman--but it\r\ngiveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so. \xc2\xa0My brother there\r\nwill tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be\r\nupon me. \xc2\xa0A penny, dear sir, a penny, to buy a little food; then leave\r\nme to my sorrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,\xe2\x80\x9d--and he fumbled\r\nin his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, poor lad,\r\ntake them and most welcome. \xc2\xa0Now come hither, my boy, and help me carry\r\nthy stricken brother to yon house, where--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not his brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, interrupting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! not his brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hear him!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ndenies his own brother--and he with one foot in the grave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother. \xc2\xa0For\r\nshame!--and he scarce able to move hand or foot. \xc2\xa0If he is not thy\r\nbrother, who is he, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beggar and a thief! \xc2\xa0He has got your money and has picked your pocket\r\nlikewise. \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 thou would\xe2\x80\x99st do a healing miracle, lay thy staff over\r\nhis shoulders and trust Providence for the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Hugo did not tarry for the miracle. \xc2\xa0In a moment he was up and off\r\nlike the wind, the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry\r\nlustily as he went. \xc2\xa0The King, breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for\r\nhis own release, fled in the opposite direction, and did not slacken\r\nhis pace until he was out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s reach. \xc2\xa0He took the first road that\r\noffered, and soon put the village behind him. \xc2\xa0He hurried along, as\r\nbriskly as he could, during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over\r\nhis shoulder for pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful\r\nsense of security took their place. \xc2\xa0He recognised, now, that he was\r\nhungry, and also very tired. \xc2\xa0So he halted at a farmhouse; but when\r\nhe was about to speak, he was cut short and driven rudely away. \xc2\xa0His\r\nclothes were against him.\r\n\r\nHe wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put himself\r\nin the way of like treatment no more. \xc2\xa0But hunger is pride\xe2\x80\x99s master; so,\r\nas the evening drew near, he made an attempt at another farmhouse; but\r\nhere he fared worse than before; for he was called hard names and was\r\npromised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly.\r\n\r\nThe night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore monarch\r\nlaboured slowly on. \xc2\xa0He was obliged to keep moving, for every time he\r\nsat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold. \xc2\xa0All\r\nhis sensations and experiences, as he moved through the solemn gloom\r\nand the empty vastness of the night, were new and strange to him. \xc2\xa0At\r\nintervals he heard voices approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and\r\nas he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of\r\nformless drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about\r\nit all that made him shudder. \xc2\xa0Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a\r\nlight--always far away, apparently--almost in another world; if he heard\r\nthe tinkle of a sheep\xe2\x80\x99s bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct;\r\nthe muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in\r\nvanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then came the complaining\r\nhowl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds\r\nwere remote; they made the little King feel that all life and activity\r\nwere far removed from him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in\r\nthe centre of a measureless solitude.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new\r\nexperience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves\r\noverhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he\r\ncame suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand. \xc2\xa0He\r\nstepped back into the shadows and waited. \xc2\xa0The lantern stood by the\r\nopen door of a barn. \xc2\xa0The King waited some time--there was no sound,\r\nand nobody stirring. \xc2\xa0He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable\r\nbarn looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and\r\nenter. He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing\r\nthe threshold he heard voices behind him. \xc2\xa0He darted behind a cask,\r\nwithin the barn, and stooped down. \xc2\xa0Two farm-labourers came in, bringing\r\nthe lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile. \xc2\xa0Whilst they\r\nmoved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took\r\nthe bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end\r\nof the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to\r\nhimself. \xc2\xa0He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway\r\nof the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the\r\ncrown of England for one night.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind\r\nthem and taking the lantern with them. \xc2\xa0The shivering King made for the\r\nblankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them\r\nup, and then groped his way safely to the stall. \xc2\xa0Of two of the blankets\r\nhe made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two. \xc2\xa0He was a\r\nglad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite\r\nwarm enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost\r\nsuffocatingly powerful.\r\n\r\nAlthough the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so\r\ndrowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage\r\nof the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of\r\nsemi-consciousness. \xc2\xa0Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself\r\nwholly, he distinctly felt something touch him! \xc2\xa0He was broad awake in\r\na moment, and gasping for breath. \xc2\xa0The cold horror of that mysterious\r\ntouch in the dark almost made his heart stand still. \xc2\xa0He lay motionless,\r\nand listened, scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was\r\nno sound. \xc2\xa0He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long\r\ntime, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound. \xc2\xa0So he began\r\nto drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that\r\nmysterious touch again! \xc2\xa0It was a grisly thing, this light touch from\r\nthis noiseless and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly\r\nfears. \xc2\xa0What should he do? \xc2\xa0That was the question; but he did not know\r\nhow to answer it. \xc2\xa0Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters\r\nand fly from this inscrutable horror? \xc2\xa0But fly whither? \xc2\xa0He could\r\nnot get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and\r\nthither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls, with this\r\nphantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch\r\nupon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was intolerable. \xc2\xa0But to stay\r\nwhere he was, and endure this living death all night--was that better?\r\n\xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0What, then, was there left to do? \xc2\xa0Ah, there was but one course;\r\nhe knew it well--he must put out his hand and find that thing!\r\n\r\nIt was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try\r\nit. Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark,\r\ngingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp--not because it\r\nhad encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just\r\n_going_ to. \xc2\xa0But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his\r\nhand lightly swept against something soft and warm. \xc2\xa0This petrified him,\r\nnearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine\r\nthe thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm.\r\nHe thought he would rather die than touch it again. \xc2\xa0But he thought this\r\nfalse thought because he did not know the immortal strength of\r\nhuman curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping\r\nagain--against his judgment, and without his consent--but groping\r\npersistently on, just the same. \xc2\xa0It encountered a bunch of long hair; he\r\nshuddered, but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm\r\nrope; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!--for the rope was\r\nnot a rope at all, but the calf\xe2\x80\x99s tail.\r\n\r\nThe King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that\r\nfright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he\r\nneed not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened\r\nhim, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and\r\nany other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and\r\nsuffered just as he had done.\r\n\r\nThe King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a\r\ncalf, but delighted to have the calf\xe2\x80\x99s company; for he had been feeling\r\nso lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even\r\nthis humble animal were welcome. \xc2\xa0And he had been so buffeted, so rudely\r\nentreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel\r\nthat he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at\r\nleast a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes\r\nmight be lacking. \xc2\xa0So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with\r\nthe calf.\r\n\r\nWhile stroking its sleek warm back--for it lay near him and within easy\r\nreach--it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways\r\nthan one. \xc2\xa0Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to\r\nthe calf; then he cuddled himself up to the calf\xe2\x80\x99s back, drew the covers\r\nup over himself and his friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and\r\ncomfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace\r\nof Westminster.\r\n\r\nPleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller seeming. \xc2\xa0He\r\nwas free of the bonds of servitude and crime, free of the companionship\r\nof base and brutal outlaws; he was warm; he was sheltered; in a word, he\r\nwas happy. \xc2\xa0The night wind was rising; it swept by in fitful gusts\r\nthat made the old barn quake and rattle, then its forces died down\r\nat intervals, and went moaning and wailing around corners and\r\nprojections--but it was all music to the King, now that he was snug and\r\ncomfortable: let it blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan\r\nand wail, he minded it not, he only enjoyed it. \xc2\xa0He merely snuggled\r\nthe closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted\r\nblissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that\r\nwas full of serenity and peace. \xc2\xa0The distant dogs howled, the melancholy\r\nkine complained, and the winds went on raging, whilst furious sheets\r\nof rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty of England slept on,\r\nundisturbed, and the calf did the same, it being a simple creature, and\r\nnot easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. The Prince with the peasants.\r\n\r\nWhen the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet but\r\nthoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy\r\nbed for itself in his bosom. \xc2\xa0Being disturbed now, it scampered away.\r\nThe boy smiled, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fool, why so fearful? \xc2\xa0I am as forlorn\r\nas thou.  \xe2\x80\x98Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so\r\nhelpless. \xc2\xa0Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king\r\nhas fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely\r\nmeaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no\r\nlower go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard the sound\r\nof children\xe2\x80\x99s voices. \xc2\xa0The barn door opened and a couple of little girls\r\ncame in. \xc2\xa0As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased, and\r\nthey stopped and stood still, gazing at him with strong curiosity; they\r\npresently began to whisper together, then they approached nearer, and\r\nstopped again to gaze and whisper. \xc2\xa0By-and-by they gathered courage and\r\nbegan to discuss him aloud. \xc2\xa0One said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hath a comely face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other added--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pretty hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is ill clothed enow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how starved he looketh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining\r\nhim minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of\r\nanimal, but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he\r\nmight be a sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion. \xc2\xa0Finally they\r\nhalted before him, holding each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands for protection, and took a\r\ngood satisfying stare with their innocent eyes; then one of them plucked\r\nup all her courage and inquired with honest directness--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho art thou, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the King,\xe2\x80\x9d was the grave answer.\r\n\r\nThe children gave a little start, and their eyes spread themselves wide\r\nopen and remained so during a speechless half minute. \xc2\xa0Then curiosity\r\nbroke the silence--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _King_? \xc2\xa0What King?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children looked at each other--then at him--then at each other\r\nagain--wonderingly, perplexedly; then one said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst hear him, Margery?--he said he is the King. \xc2\xa0Can that be true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can it be else but true, Prissy? \xc2\xa0Would he say a lie? \xc2\xa0For look\r\nyou, Prissy, an\xe2\x80\x99 it were not true, it _would_ be a lie. \xc2\xa0It surely would\r\nbe. Now think on\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0For all things that be not true, be lies--thou\r\ncanst make nought else out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a good tight argument, without a leak in it anywhere; and it left\r\nPrissy\xe2\x80\x99s half-doubts not a leg to stand on. \xc2\xa0She considered a moment,\r\nthen put the King upon his honour with the simple remark--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou art truly the King, then I believe thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am truly the King.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis settled the matter. \xc2\xa0His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s royalty was accepted without\r\nfurther question or discussion, and the two little girls began at once\r\nto inquire into how he came to be where he was, and how he came to be so\r\nunroyally clad, and whither he was bound, and all about his affairs. \xc2\xa0It\r\nwas a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not\r\nbe scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting\r\neven his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and\r\ntenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids. \xc2\xa0But when he got down\r\nto his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without\r\nfood, they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a\r\nbreakfast for him.\r\n\r\nThe King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\r\nam come to mine own again, I will always honour little children,\r\nremembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time\r\nof trouble; whilst they that were older, and thought themselves wiser,\r\nmocked at me and held me for a liar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children\xe2\x80\x99s mother received the King kindly, and was full of pity;\r\nfor his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her\r\nwomanly heart. \xc2\xa0She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had\r\nseen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate. \xc2\xa0She\r\nimagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or\r\nkeepers; so she tried to find out whence he had come, in order that\r\nshe might take measures to return him; but all her references to\r\nneighbouring towns and villages, and all her inquiries in the same line\r\nwent for nothing--the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face, and his answers, too, showed that the\r\nthings she was talking of were not familiar to him. \xc2\xa0He spoke earnestly\r\nand simply about court matters, and broke down, more than once, when\r\nspeaking of the late King \xe2\x80\x98his father\xe2\x80\x99; but whenever the conversation\r\nchanged to baser topics, he lost interest and became silent.\r\n\r\nThe woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up. \xc2\xa0As she\r\nproceeded with her cooking, she set herself to contriving devices to\r\nsurprise the boy into betraying his real secret. \xc2\xa0She talked about\r\ncattle--he showed no concern; then about sheep--the same result: \xc2\xa0so\r\nher guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error; she talked about\r\nmills; and about weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all\r\nsorts; and about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats: \xc2\xa0but no\r\nmatter, she was baffled at all points. \xc2\xa0Not altogether, either; for she\r\nargued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service. \xc2\xa0Yes,\r\nshe was sure she was on the right track, now; he must have been a house\r\nservant. \xc2\xa0So she led up to that. \xc2\xa0But the result was discouraging. The\r\nsubject of sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir\r\nhim; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm. The goodwife touched,\r\nwith a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the subject\r\nof cooking. \xc2\xa0To her surprise, and her vast delight, the King\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nlighted at once! \xc2\xa0Ah, she had hunted him down at last, she thought; and\r\nshe was right proud, too, of the devious shrewdness and tact which had\r\naccomplished it.\r\n\r\nHer tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King\xe2\x80\x99s, inspired\r\nby gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering\r\npots and pans, turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an\r\neloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes, that within three\r\nminutes the woman said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cOf a truth I was right--he hath\r\nholpen in a kitchen!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then he broadened his bill of fare, and discussed\r\nit with such appreciation and animation, that the goodwife said to\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x9cGood lack! how can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones\r\nwithal? \xc2\xa0For these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great.\r\n\xc2\xa0Ah, now I see! ragged outcast as he is, he must have served in the\r\npalace before his reason went astray; yes, he must have helped in the\r\nvery kitchen of the King himself! \xc2\xa0I will test him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFull of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to mind the\r\ncooking a moment--hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or\r\ntwo, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave her children a\r\nsign to follow after. \xc2\xa0The King muttered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone\r\ntime--it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the\r\ngreat Alfred stooped to assume. \xc2\xa0But I will try to better serve my trust\r\nthan he; for he let the cakes burn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to it, for\r\nthis King, like the other one, soon fell into deep thinkings concerning\r\nhis vast affairs, and the same calamity resulted--the cookery got\r\nburned. The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire\r\ndestruction; and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a\r\nbrisk and cordial tongue-lashing. Then, seeing how troubled he was\r\nover his violated trust, she softened at once, and was all goodness and\r\ngentleness toward him.\r\n\r\nThe boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly refreshed and\r\ngladdened by it. \xc2\xa0It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious\r\nfeature, that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither recipient\r\nof the favour was aware that it had been extended. \xc2\xa0The goodwife had\r\nintended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner,\r\nlike any other tramp or like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the\r\nscolding she had given him, that she did what she could to atone for it\r\nby allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on\r\nostensible terms of equality with them; and the King, on his side, was\r\nso remorseful for having broken his trust, after the family had been so\r\nkind to him, that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself\r\nto the family level, instead of requiring the woman and her children to\r\nstand and wait upon him, while he occupied their table in the solitary\r\nstate due to his birth and dignity. \xc2\xa0It does us all good to unbend\r\nsometimes. \xc2\xa0This good woman was made happy all the day long by the\r\napplauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension\r\nto a tramp; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious\r\nhumility toward a humble peasant woman.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up the\r\ndishes. \xc2\xa0This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and the King came\r\nnear rebelling; but then he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAlfred the Great watched\r\nthe cakes; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too--therefore will\r\nI essay it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too, for the\r\ncleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do.\r\nIt was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it\r\nat last. \xc2\xa0He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now;\r\nhowever, he was not to lose this thrifty dame\xe2\x80\x99s society so easily. \xc2\xa0She\r\nfurnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got\r\nthrough with after a fair fashion and with some credit. \xc2\xa0Then she set\r\nhim and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so\r\nawkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a\r\nbutcher knife to grind.\r\n\r\nAfterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid\r\nthe good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in\r\nthe matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in\r\nstory-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign. \xc2\xa0And\r\nwhen, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket\r\nof kittens to drown, he did resign. \xc2\xa0At least he was just going to\r\nresign--for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and it\r\nseemed to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right\r\nthing--when there was an interruption. \xc2\xa0The interruption was John\r\nCanty--with a peddler\xe2\x80\x99s pack on his back--and Hugo.\r\n\r\nThe King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they\r\nhad had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about drawing the line,\r\nbut took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way,\r\nwithout a word. \xc2\xa0He left the creatures in an out-house, and hurried on,\r\ninto a narrow lane at the rear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. The Prince and the hermit.\r\n\r\nThe high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the impulse of\r\na deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the\r\ndistance. \xc2\xa0He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter\r\nof the forest; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance.\r\nThat was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but\r\nhurried on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the\r\ntwilight depths of the wood. Then he stopped; being persuaded that he\r\nwas now tolerably safe. He listened intently, but the stillness was\r\nprofound and solemn--awful, even, and depressing to the spirits. \xc2\xa0At\r\nwide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so\r\nremote, and hollow, and mysterious, that they seemed not to be real\r\nsounds, but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed\r\nones. \xc2\xa0So the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIt was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the rest of\r\nthe day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and he was at\r\nlast obliged to resume movement in order to get warm. He struck straight\r\nthrough the forest, hoping to pierce to a road presently, but he was\r\ndisappointed in this. \xc2\xa0He travelled on and on; but the farther he went,\r\nthe denser the wood became, apparently. \xc2\xa0The gloom began to thicken,\r\nby-and-by, and the King realised that the night was coming on. \xc2\xa0It made\r\nhim shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he\r\ntried to hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he could\r\nnot now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously; consequently he\r\nkept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers.\r\n\r\nAnd how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light! He\r\napproached it warily, stopping often to look about him and listen. \xc2\xa0It\r\ncame from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut. \xc2\xa0He heard\r\na voice, now, and felt a disposition to run and hide; but he changed his\r\nmind at once, for this voice was praying, evidently. \xc2\xa0He glided to the\r\none window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance\r\nwithin. \xc2\xa0The room was small; its floor was the natural earth, beaten\r\nhard by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or\r\ntwo; near it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or three pots and pans;\r\nthere was a short bench and a three-legged stool; on the hearth the\r\nremains of a faggot fire were smouldering; before a shrine, which was\r\nlighted by a single candle, knelt an aged man, and on an old wooden box\r\nat his side lay an open book and a human skull. \xc2\xa0The man was of large,\r\nbony frame; his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white; he\r\nwas clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA holy hermit!\xe2\x80\x9d said the King to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cnow am I indeed fortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked. \xc2\xa0A deep voice\r\nresponded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnter!--but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt stand\r\nis holy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King entered, and paused. \xc2\xa0The hermit turned a pair of gleaming,\r\nunrestful eyes upon him, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the King,\xe2\x80\x9d came the answer, with placid simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, King!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the hermit, with enthusiasm. \xc2\xa0Then, bustling\r\nabout with feverish activity, and constantly saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he arranged his bench, seated the King on it, by the hearth, threw some\r\nfaggots on the fire, and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous\r\nstride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome! \xc2\xa0Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were not worthy,\r\nand were turned away. \xc2\xa0But a King who casts his crown away, and despises\r\nthe vain splendours of his office, and clothes his body in rags, to\r\ndevote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh--he is\r\nworthy, he is welcome!--here shall he abide all his days till death\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The King hastened to interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid\r\nno attention to him--did not even hear him, apparently, but went right\r\non with his talk, with a raised voice and a growing energy.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou\r\nshalt be at peace here. \xc2\xa0None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee\r\nwith supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which God\r\nhath moved thee to abandon. \xc2\xa0Thou shalt pray here; thou shalt study the\r\nBook; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world,\r\nand upon the sublimities of the world to come; thou shalt feed upon\r\ncrusts and herbs, and scourge thy body with whips, daily, to the\r\npurifying of thy soul. Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin;\r\nthou shalt drink water only; and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at\r\npeace; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again, baffled; he\r\nshall not find thee, he shall not molest thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud, and\r\nbegan to mutter. \xc2\xa0The King seized this opportunity to state his case;\r\nand he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension.\r\n\xc2\xa0But the hermit went on muttering, and gave no heed. \xc2\xa0And still\r\nmuttering, he approached the King and said impressively--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Sh! \xc2\xa0I will tell you a secret!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He bent down to impart it, but\r\nchecked himself, and assumed a listening attitude. \xc2\xa0After a moment\r\nor two he went on tiptoe to the window-opening, put his head out, and\r\npeered around in the gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his\r\nface close down to the King\xe2\x80\x99s, and whispered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an archangel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King started violently, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWould God I were with\r\nthe outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a madman!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0His\r\napprehensions were heightened, and they showed plainly in his face. \xc2\xa0In\r\na low excited voice the hermit continued--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you feel my atmosphere! \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s awe in your face! \xc2\xa0None may\r\nbe in this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for it is the very\r\natmosphere of heaven. \xc2\xa0I go thither and return, in the twinkling of an\r\neye. \xc2\xa0I was made an archangel on this very spot, it is five years ago,\r\nby angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity. \xc2\xa0Their presence\r\nfilled this place with an intolerable brightness. \xc2\xa0And they knelt to me,\r\nKing! yes, they knelt to me! for I was greater than they. \xc2\xa0I have walked\r\nin the courts of heaven, and held speech with the patriarchs. \xc2\xa0Touch\r\nmy hand--be not afraid--touch it. \xc2\xa0There--now thou hast touched a hand\r\nwhich has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob! \xc2\xa0For I have\r\nwalked in the golden courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He\r\npaused, to give this speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and\r\nhe started to his feet again saying, with angry energy, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am an\r\narchangel; _a mere archangel!_--I that might have been pope! \xc2\xa0It is\r\nverily true. \xc2\xa0I was told it from heaven in a dream, twenty years ago;\r\nah, yes, I was to be pope!--and I _should_ have been pope, for Heaven\r\nhad said it--but the King dissolved my religious house, and I, poor\r\nobscure unfriended monk, was cast homeless upon the world, robbed of my\r\nmighty destiny!\xe2\x80\x9d Here he began to mumble again, and beat his forehead in\r\nfutile rage, with his fist; now and then articulating a venomous curse,\r\nand now and then a pathetic \xe2\x80\x9cWherefore I am nought but an archangel--I\r\nthat should have been pope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and\r\nsuffered. Then all at once the old man\xe2\x80\x99s frenzy departed, and he became\r\nall gentleness. \xc2\xa0His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and\r\nfell to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s heart completely. \xc2\xa0The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the\r\nfire and made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions\r\nwith a deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a\r\nsupper--chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x99s cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that in\r\na little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were\r\nchanged to reverence and affection for the man.\r\n\r\nThis happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper; then,\r\nafter a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the boy to bed, in a\r\nsmall adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother\r\nmight; and so, with a parting caress, left him and sat down by the\r\nfire, and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way.\r\nPresently he paused; then tapped his forehead several times with his\r\nfingers, as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his\r\nmind. \xc2\xa0Apparently he was unsuccessful. \xc2\xa0Now he started quickly up, and\r\nentered his guest\xe2\x80\x99s room, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art King?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d was the response, drowsily uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat King?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf England? \xc2\xa0Then Henry is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlack, it is so. \xc2\xa0I am his son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA black frown settled down upon the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s face, and he clenched his\r\nbony hands with a vindictive energy. \xc2\xa0He stood a few moments, breathing\r\nfast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and\r\nhomeless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no response. \xc2\xa0The old man bent down and scanned the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreposeful face and listened to his placid breathing.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe sleeps--sleeps\r\nsoundly;\xe2\x80\x9d and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of\r\nevil satisfaction. \xc2\xa0A smile flitted across the dreaming boy\xe2\x80\x99s features.\r\nThe hermit muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cSo--his heart is happy;\xe2\x80\x9d and he turned away. \xc2\xa0He\r\nwent stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something;\r\nnow and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head around\r\nand casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always muttering, always\r\nmumbling to himself. \xc2\xa0At last he found what he seemed to want--a rusty\r\nold butcher knife and a whetstone. \xc2\xa0Then he crept to his place by the\r\nfire, sat himself down, and began to whet the knife softly on the stone,\r\nstill muttering, mumbling, ejaculating. \xc2\xa0The winds sighed around the\r\nlonely place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the\r\ndistances. \xc2\xa0The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at\r\nthe old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on with his work, rapt,\r\nabsorbed, and noted none of these things.\r\n\r\nAt long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife, and\r\nnodded his head with satisfaction.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt grows sharper,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\r\nit grows sharper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on,\r\nentertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out occasionally in\r\narticulate speech--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father wrought us evil, he destroyed us--and is gone down into the\r\neternal fires! \xc2\xa0Yes, down into the eternal fires! \xc2\xa0He escaped us--but it\r\nwas God\xe2\x80\x99s will, yes it was God\xe2\x80\x99s will, we must not repine. \xc2\xa0But he\r\nhath not escaped the fires! \xc2\xa0No, he hath not escaped the fires, the\r\nconsuming, unpitying, remorseless fires--and _they_ are everlasting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he wrought, and still wrought--mumbling, chuckling a low rasping\r\nchuckle at times--and at times breaking again into words--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was his father that did it all. \xc2\xa0I am but an archangel; but for him\r\nI should be pope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King stirred. \xc2\xa0The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside, and\r\nwent down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate form with his knife\r\nuplifted. \xc2\xa0The boy stirred again; his eyes came open for an instant, but\r\nthere was no speculation in them, they saw nothing; the next moment his\r\ntranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more.\r\n\r\nThe hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his position and\r\nscarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms, and presently crept\r\naway, saying,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry out, lest\r\nby accident someone be passing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there, and\r\nanother one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle handling\r\nhe managed to tie the King\xe2\x80\x99s ankles together without waking him. \xc2\xa0Next\r\nhe essayed to tie the wrists; he made several attempts to cross them,\r\nbut the boy always drew one hand or the other away, just as the cord was\r\nready to be applied; but at last, when the archangel was almost ready\r\nto despair, the boy crossed his hands himself, and the next moment\r\nthey were bound. Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s chin and\r\nbrought up over his head and tied fast--and so softly, so gradually,\r\nand so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy\r\nslept peacefully through it all without stirring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. Hendon to the rescue.\r\n\r\nThe old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and brought the\r\nlow bench. \xc2\xa0He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and\r\nflickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving\r\neyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there,\r\nheedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled\r\nand chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as\r\na grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay\r\nbound and helpless in his web.\r\n\r\nAfter a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,--yet not seeing,\r\nhis mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction,--observed, on a\r\nsudden, that the boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were open! wide open and staring!--staring\r\nup in frozen horror at the knife. \xc2\xa0The smile of a gratified devil crept\r\nover the old man\xe2\x80\x99s face, and he said, without changing his attitude or\r\nhis occupation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSon of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time forced\r\na smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit chose to\r\ninterpret as an affirmative answer to his question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen pray again. \xc2\xa0Pray the prayer for the dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shudder shook the boy\xe2\x80\x99s frame, and his face blenched. \xc2\xa0Then he\r\nstruggled again to free himself--turning and twisting himself this way\r\nand that; tugging frantically, fiercely, desperately--but uselessly--to\r\nburst his fetters; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him,\r\nand nodded his head, and placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time\r\nto time, \xe2\x80\x9cThe moments are precious, they are few and precious--pray the\r\nprayer for the dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his struggles,\r\npanting. \xc2\xa0The tears came, then, and trickled, one after the other, down\r\nhis face; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the\r\nsavage old man.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up sharply,\r\nwith a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may not indulge this ecstasy longer! \xc2\xa0The night is already gone. \xc2\xa0It\r\nseems but a moment--only a moment; would it had endured a year! \xc2\xa0Seed of\r\nthe Church\xe2\x80\x99s spoiler, close thy perishing eyes, an\xe2\x80\x99 thou fearest to look\r\nupon--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings. \xc2\xa0The old man sank upon his\r\nknees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy.\r\n\r\nHark! \xc2\xa0There was a sound of voices near the cabin--the knife dropped\r\nfrom the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up,\r\ntrembling. \xc2\xa0The sounds increased, and presently the voices became rough\r\nand angry; then came blows, and cries for help; then a clatter of swift\r\nfootsteps, retreating. \xc2\xa0Immediately came a succession of thundering\r\nknocks upon the cabin door, followed by--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo-o-o! \xc2\xa0Open! \xc2\xa0And despatch, in the name of all the devils!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears; for it was Miles Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s voice!\r\n\r\nThe hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of\r\nthe bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway the King\r\nheard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the \xe2\x80\x98chapel\xe2\x80\x99:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHomage and greeting, reverend sir! \xc2\xa0Where is the boy--_my_ boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat boy, friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat boy! \xc2\xa0Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!--I am not\r\nin the humour for it. \xc2\xa0Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I\r\njudged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; they said he was\r\nat large again, and they had tracked him to your door. \xc2\xa0They showed me\r\nhis very footprints. \xc2\xa0Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthou produce him not--Where is the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried\r\nhere the night. \xc2\xa0If such as you take an interest in such as he, know,\r\nthen, that I have sent him of an errand. \xc2\xa0He will be back anon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow soon? \xc2\xa0How soon? \xc2\xa0Come, waste not the time--cannot I overtake him?\r\nHow soon will he be back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou need\xe2\x80\x99st not stir; he will return quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it, then. \xc2\xa0I will try to wait. \xc2\xa0But stop!--_you_ sent him of an\r\nerrand?--you! \xc2\xa0Verily this is a lie--he would not go. \xc2\xa0He would pull thy\r\nold beard, an\xe2\x80\x99 thou didst offer him such an insolence. Thou hast lied,\r\nfriend; thou hast surely lied! \xc2\xa0He would not go for thee, nor for any\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor any _man_--no; haply not. \xc2\xa0But I am not a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_! \xc2\xa0Now o\xe2\x80\x99 God\xe2\x80\x99s name what art thou, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a secret--mark thou reveal it not. \xc2\xa0I am an archangel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon--not altogether\r\nunprofane--followed by--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis doth well and truly account for his complaisance! \xc2\xa0Right well\r\nI knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any\r\nmortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when an archangel gives the\r\nword o\xe2\x80\x99 command! \xc2\xa0Let me--\xe2\x80\x98sh! \xc2\xa0What noise was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this while the little King had been yonder, alternately quaking with\r\nterror and trembling with hope; and all the while, too, he had thrown\r\nall the strength he could into his anguished moanings, constantly\r\nexpecting them to reach Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s ear, but always realising, with\r\nbitterness, that they failed, or at least made no impression. \xc2\xa0So this\r\nlast remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh\r\nfields to the dying; and he exerted himself once more, and with all his\r\nenergy, just as the hermit was saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoise? \xc2\xa0I heard only the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayhap it was. \xc2\xa0Yes, doubtless that was it. \xc2\xa0I have been hearing it\r\nfaintly all the--there it is again! \xc2\xa0It is not the wind! \xc2\xa0What an odd\r\nsound! \xc2\xa0Come, we will hunt it out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the King\xe2\x80\x99s joy was nearly insupportable. \xc2\xa0His tired lungs did\r\ntheir utmost--and hopefully, too--but the sealed jaws and the muffling\r\nsheepskin sadly crippled the effort. \xc2\xa0Then the poor fellow\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank,\r\nto hear the hermit say--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it came from without--I think from the copse yonder. \xc2\xa0Come, I will\r\nlead the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps die\r\nquickly away--then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful silence.\r\n\r\nIt seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching\r\nagain--and this time he heard an added sound,--the trampling of hoofs,\r\napparently. \xc2\xa0Then he heard Hendon say--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not wait longer. \xc2\xa0I _cannot_ wait longer. \xc2\xa0He has lost his way\r\nin this thick wood. \xc2\xa0Which direction took he? \xc2\xa0Quick--point it out to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe--but wait; I will go with thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood--good! \xc2\xa0Why, truly thou art better than thy looks. \xc2\xa0Marry I do\r\nnot think there\xe2\x80\x99s not another archangel with so right a heart as thine.\r\n\xc2\xa0Wilt ride? \xc2\xa0Wilt take the wee donkey that\xe2\x80\x99s for my boy, or wilt thou\r\nfork thy holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have\r\nprovided for myself?--and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the\r\nindifferent sum of a month\xe2\x80\x99s usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker\r\nout of work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own feet, and\r\nwill walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life in my\r\nhands and make what success I may toward mounting the big one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen followed a confusion of kicks, cuffs, tramplings and plungings,\r\naccompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses, and\r\nfinally a bitter apostrophe to the mule, which must have broken its\r\nspirit, for hostilities seemed to cease from that moment.\r\n\r\nWith unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the voices and\r\nfootsteps fade away and die out. \xc2\xa0All hope forsook him, now, for the\r\nmoment, and a dull despair settled down upon his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cMy only friend\r\nis deceived and got rid of,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe hermit will return and--\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He\r\nfinished with a gasp; and at once fell to struggling so frantically with\r\nhis bonds again, that he shook off the smothering sheepskin.\r\n\r\nAnd now he heard the door open! \xc2\xa0The sound chilled him to the\r\nmarrow--already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat. \xc2\xa0Horror made\r\nhim close his eyes; horror made him open them again--and before him\r\nstood John Canty and Hugo!\r\n\r\nHe would have said \xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d if his jaws had been free.\r\n\r\nA moment or two later his limbs were at liberty, and his captors, each\r\ngripping him by an arm, were hurrying him with all speed through the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. A Victim of Treachery.\r\n\r\nOnce more \xe2\x80\x98King Foo-foo the First\xe2\x80\x99 was roving with the tramps and\r\noutlaws, a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted railleries, and\r\nsometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of Canty and\r\nHugo when the Ruffler\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned. \xc2\xa0None but Canty and Hugo really\r\ndisliked him. \xc2\xa0Some of the others liked him, and all admired his pluck\r\nand spirit. \xc2\xa0During two or three days, Hugo, in whose ward and charge\r\nthe King was, did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable;\r\nand at night, during the customary orgies, he amused the company by\r\nputting small indignities upon him--always as if by accident. \xc2\xa0Twice he\r\nstepped upon the King\xe2\x80\x99s toes--accidentally--and the King, as became his\r\nroyalty, was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it; but\r\nthe third time Hugo entertained himself in that way, the King felled\r\nhim to the ground with a cudgel, to the prodigious delight of the tribe.\r\n\xc2\xa0Hugo, consumed with anger and shame, sprang up, seized a cudgel, and\r\ncame at his small adversary in a fury. \xc2\xa0Instantly a ring was formed\r\naround the gladiators, and the betting and cheering began.\r\n\r\nBut poor Hugo stood no chance whatever. \xc2\xa0His frantic and lubberly\r\n\xe2\x80\x98prentice-work found but a poor market for itself when pitted against\r\nan arm which had been trained by the first masters of Europe in\r\nsingle-stick, quarter-staff, and every art and trick of swordsmanship.\r\n\xc2\xa0The little King stood, alert but at graceful ease, and caught and\r\nturned aside the thick rain of blows with a facility and precision which\r\nset the motley on-lookers wild with admiration; and every now and then,\r\nwhen his practised eye detected an opening, and a lightning-swift rap\r\nupon Hugo\xe2\x80\x99s head followed as a result, the storm of cheers and laughter\r\nthat swept the place was something wonderful to hear. \xc2\xa0At the end of\r\nfifteen minutes, Hugo, all battered, bruised, and the target for\r\na pitiless bombardment of ridicule, slunk from the field; and the\r\nunscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the\r\nshoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the\r\nRuffler, where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the Game-Cocks;\r\nhis meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled and annulled,\r\nand a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against any who\r\nshould thenceforth utter it.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had failed. He\r\nhad stubbornly refused to act; moreover, he was always trying to escape.\r\n\xc2\xa0He had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen, the first day of his\r\nreturn; he not only came forth empty-handed, but tried to rouse the\r\nhousemates. He was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work;\r\nhe would not work; moreover, he threatened the tinker with his own\r\nsoldering-iron; and finally both Hugo and the tinker found their\r\nhands full with the mere matter of keeping his from getting away. \xc2\xa0He\r\ndelivered the thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered\r\nhis liberties or tried to force him to service. \xc2\xa0He was sent out, in\r\nHugo\xe2\x80\x99s charge, in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased baby,\r\nto beg; but the result was not encouraging--he declined to plead for the\r\nmendicants, or be a party to their cause in any way.\r\n\r\nThus several days went by; and the miseries of this tramping life, and\r\nthe weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it, became\r\ngradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at\r\nlast to feel that his release from the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s knife must prove only a\r\ntemporary respite from death, at best.\r\n\r\nBut at night, in his dreams, these things were forgotten, and he was\r\non his throne, and master again. \xc2\xa0This, of course, intensified the\r\nsufferings of the awakening--so the mortifications of each succeeding\r\nmorning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the\r\ncombat with Hugo, grew bitterer and bitterer, and harder and harder to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nThe morning after that combat, Hugo got up with a heart filled with\r\nvengeful purposes against the King. \xc2\xa0He had two plans, in particular.\r\nOne was to inflict upon the lad what would be, to his proud spirit\r\nand \xe2\x80\x98imagined\xe2\x80\x99 royalty, a peculiar humiliation; and if he failed to\r\naccomplish this, his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the\r\nKing, and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the first plan, he purposed to put a \xe2\x80\x98clime\xe2\x80\x99 upon the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and\r\nperfect degree; and as soon as the clime should operate, he meant to get\r\nCanty\xe2\x80\x99s help, and _force_ the King to expose his leg in the highway\r\nand beg for alms.  \xe2\x80\x98Clime\xe2\x80\x99 was the cant term for a sore, artificially\r\ncreated. To make a clime, the operator made a paste or poultice of\r\nunslaked lime, soap, and the rust of old iron, and spread it upon a\r\npiece of leather, which was then bound tightly upon the leg. \xc2\xa0This would\r\npresently fret off the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking;\r\nblood was then rubbed upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a\r\ndark and repulsive colour. \xc2\xa0Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in\r\na cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen,\r\nand move the compassion of the passer-by. {8}\r\n\r\nHugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the\r\nsoldering-iron; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as soon\r\nas they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker\r\nheld him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg.\r\n\r\nThe King raged and stormed, and promised to hang the two the moment the\r\nsceptre was in his hand again; but they kept a firm grip upon him\r\nand enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats. \xc2\xa0This\r\ncontinued until the poultice began to bite; and in no long time its work\r\nwould have been perfected, if there had been no interruption. \xc2\xa0But there\r\nwas; for about this time the \xe2\x80\x98slave\xe2\x80\x99 who had made the speech denouncing\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x99s laws, appeared on the scene, and put an end to the enterprise,\r\nand stripped off the poultice and bandage.\r\n\r\nThe King wanted to borrow his deliverer\xe2\x80\x99s cudgel and warm the jackets\r\nof the two rascals on the spot; but the man said no, it would bring\r\ntrouble--leave the matter till night; the whole tribe being together,\r\nthen, the outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt. \xc2\xa0He\r\nmarched the party back to camp and reported the affair to the Ruffler,\r\nwho listened, pondered, and then decided that the King should not be\r\nagain detailed to beg, since it was plain he was worthy of something\r\nhigher and better--wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the\r\nmendicant rank and appointed him to steal!\r\n\r\nHugo was overjoyed. \xc2\xa0He had already tried to make the King steal, and\r\nfailed; but there would be no more trouble of that sort, now, for of\r\ncourse the King would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered\r\ndirectly from head-quarters. \xc2\xa0So he planned a raid for that very\r\nafternoon, purposing to get the King in the law\xe2\x80\x99s grip in the course of\r\nit; and to do it, too, with such ingenious strategy, that it should seem\r\nto be accidental and unintentional; for the King of the Game-Cocks was\r\npopular now, and the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular\r\nmember who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him\r\nover to the common enemy, the law.\r\n\r\nVery well. \xc2\xa0All in good time Hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village\r\nwith his prey; and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after\r\nanother, the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil\r\npurpose, and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and\r\nget free of his infamous captivity for ever.\r\n\r\nBoth threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities; for both,\r\nin their secret hearts, were resolved to make absolutely sure work this\r\ntime, and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into\r\nany venture that had much uncertainty about it.\r\n\r\nHugo\xe2\x80\x99s chance came first. \xc2\xa0For at last a woman approached who carried a\r\nfat package of some sort in a basket. \xc2\xa0Hugo\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled with sinful\r\npleasure as he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cBreath o\xe2\x80\x99 my life, an\xe2\x80\x99 I can but\r\nput _that_ upon him, \xe2\x80\x99tis good-den and God keep thee, King of the\r\nGame-Cocks!\xe2\x80\x9d He waited and watched--outwardly patient, but inwardly\r\nconsuming with excitement--till the woman had passed by, and the time\r\nwas ripe; then said, in a low voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTarry here till I come again,\xe2\x80\x9d and darted stealthily after the prey.\r\n\r\nThe King\xe2\x80\x99s heart was filled with joy--he could make his escape, now, if\r\nHugo\xe2\x80\x99s quest only carried him far enough away.\r\n\r\nBut he was to have no such luck. \xc2\xa0Hugo crept behind the woman, snatched\r\nthe package, and came running back, wrapping it in an old piece of\r\nblanket which he carried on his arm. \xc2\xa0The hue and cry was raised in a\r\nmoment, by the woman, who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden,\r\nalthough she had not seen the pilfering done. \xc2\xa0Hugo thrust the bundle\r\ninto the King\xe2\x80\x99s hands without halting, saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow speed ye after me with the rest, and cry \xe2\x80\x98Stop thief!\xe2\x80\x99 but mind ye\r\nlead them astray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked\r\nalley--and in another moment or two he lounged into view again, looking\r\ninnocent and indifferent, and took up a position behind a post to watch\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the blanket fell\r\naway from it just as the woman arrived, with an augmenting crowd at her\r\nheels; she seized the King\xe2\x80\x99s wrist with one hand, snatched up her bundle\r\nwith the other, and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy\r\nwhile he struggled, without success, to free himself from her grip.\r\n\r\nHugo had seen enough--his enemy was captured and the law would get him,\r\nnow--so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended campwards,\r\nframing a judicious version of the matter to give to the Ruffler\xe2\x80\x99s crew\r\nas he strode along.\r\n\r\nThe King continued to struggle in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s strong grasp, and now and\r\nthen cried out in vexation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved thee of\r\nthy paltry goods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him names; a\r\nbrawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows,\r\nmade a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, for a lesson;\r\nbut just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing\r\nforce upon the man\xe2\x80\x99s arm, flat side down, the fantastic owner of it\r\nremarking pleasantly, at the same time--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood and\r\nuncharitable words. \xc2\xa0This is matter for the law\xe2\x80\x99s consideration,\r\nnot private and unofficial handling. \xc2\xa0Loose thy hold from the boy,\r\ngoodwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then went\r\nmuttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy\xe2\x80\x99s wrist\r\nreluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but prudently\r\nclosed their mouths. \xc2\xa0The King sprang to his deliverer\xe2\x80\x99s side, with\r\nflushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now, Sir\r\nMiles; carve me this rabble to rags!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. The Prince a prisoner.\r\n\r\nHendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\near--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily--nay, suffer it not to\r\nwag at all. \xc2\xa0Trust in me--all shall go well in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he added\r\nto himself:  \xe2\x80\x9c_Sir_ Miles! \xc2\xa0Bless me, I had totally forgot I was a\r\nknight! Lord, how marvellous a thing it is, the grip his memory doth\r\ntake upon his quaint and crazy fancies! . . . An empty and foolish title\r\nis mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it; for I think it is\r\nmore honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of\r\nDreams and Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of\r\nthe _real_ kingdoms of this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and was about\r\nto lay his hand upon the King\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, when Hendon said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, good friend, withhold your hand--he shall go peaceably; I am\r\nresponsible for that. \xc2\xa0Lead on, we will follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the King\r\nfollowed after, with the crowd at their heels. \xc2\xa0The King was inclined to\r\nrebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReflect, Sire--your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty;\r\nshall their source resist them, yet require the branches to respect\r\nthem? Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when the King is on\r\nhis throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was\r\nseemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and\r\nsubmitted to its authority?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King\r\nof England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he will himself\r\nsuffer while he holdeth the station of a subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the\r\npeace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who\r\nhad committed the theft; there was none able to show the contrary, so\r\nthe King stood convicted. \xc2\xa0The bundle was now unrolled, and when the\r\ncontents proved to be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked\r\ntroubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his body was thrilled with an\r\nelectric shiver of dismay; but the King remained unmoved, protected\r\nby his ignorance. \xc2\xa0The judge meditated, during an ominous pause, then\r\nturned to the woman, with the question--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou hold this property to be worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman courtesied and replied--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree shillings and eightpence, your worship--I could not abate a penny\r\nand set forth the value honestly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then nodded to\r\nthe constable, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear the court and close the doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was done. \xc2\xa0None remained but the two officials, the accused, the\r\naccuser, and Miles Hendon. \xc2\xa0This latter was rigid and colourless, and\r\non his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended\r\ntogether, and trickled down his face. \xc2\xa0The judge turned to the woman\r\nagain, and said, in a compassionate voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger, for\r\nthese be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an\r\nevil face--but when hunger driveth--Good woman! dost know that when one\r\nsteals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha\xe2\x80\x99penny the law saith\r\nhe shall _hang_ for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but controlled\r\nhimself and held his peace; but not so the woman. \xc2\xa0She sprang to her\r\nfeet, shaking with fright, and cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good lack, what have I done! \xc2\xa0God-a-mercy, I would not hang\r\nthe poor thing for the whole world! \xc2\xa0Ah, save me from this, your\r\nworship--what shall I do, what _can_ I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not yet writ\r\nupon the record.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen in God\xe2\x80\x99s name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless the day\r\nthat freed my conscience of this awesome thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King\r\nand wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him and hugging\r\nhim. The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig;\r\nand when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into\r\nthe narrow hall. \xc2\xa0The justice proceeded to write in his record book.\r\n\xc2\xa0Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer\r\nfollowed the woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and\r\nlistened. \xc2\xa0He heard a conversation to this effect--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here\r\nis the eightpence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEightpence, indeed! \xc2\xa0Thou\xe2\x80\x99lt do no such thing. \xc2\xa0It cost me three\r\nshillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the last reign, that old\r\nHarry that\xe2\x80\x99s just dead ne\xe2\x80\x99er touched or tampered with. \xc2\xa0A fig for thy\r\neightpence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStands the wind in that quarter? \xc2\xa0Thou wast under oath, and so swore\r\nfalsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence. \xc2\xa0Come straightway\r\nback with me before his worship, and answer for the crime!--and then the\r\nlad will hang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content. \xc2\xa0Give me the\r\neightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman went off crying: \xc2\xa0Hendon slipped back into the court room,\r\nand the constable presently followed, after hiding his prize in some\r\nconvenient place. \xc2\xa0The justice wrote a while longer, then read the King\r\na wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment\r\nin the common jail, to be followed by a public flogging. \xc2\xa0The astounded\r\nKing opened his mouth, and was probably going to order the good judge to\r\nbe beheaded on the spot; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and\r\nsucceeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it.\r\nHendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the\r\ntwo departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail. \xc2\xa0The moment\r\nthe street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his\r\nhand, and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail _alive_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Will_ you trust in me? \xc2\xa0Peace! and forbear to worsen our chances with\r\ndangerous speech. \xc2\xa0What God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it,\r\nthou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be patient--\xe2\x80\x98twill be time\r\nenow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d {1}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. The Escape.\r\n\r\nThe short winter day was nearly ended. \xc2\xa0The streets were deserted, save\r\nfor a few random stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the\r\nintent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands\r\nas quickly as possible, and then snugly house themselves from the rising\r\nwind and the gathering twilight. They looked neither to the right nor to\r\nthe left; they paid no attention to our party, they did not even seem\r\nto see them. Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his\r\nway to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before.\r\nBy-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square, and\r\nproceeded to cross it. \xc2\xa0When he had reached the middle of it, Hendon\r\nlaid his hand upon his arm, and said in a low voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, and I would say a\r\nword to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy duty forbids it, sir; prithee hinder me not, the night comes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee nearly. \xc2\xa0Turn thy back\r\na moment and seem not to see: \xc2\xa0_let this poor lad escape_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis to me, sir! \xc2\xa0I arrest thee in--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, be not too hasty. \xc2\xa0See thou be careful and commit no foolish\r\nerror,\xe2\x80\x9d--then he shut his voice down to a whisper, and said in the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\near--\xe2\x80\x9cthe pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck,\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then\r\nfound his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon\r\nwas tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee\r\ncome to harm. \xc2\xa0Observe, I heard it all--every word. \xc2\xa0I will prove it to\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman\r\nhad had together in the hall, word for word, and ended with--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere--have I set it forth correctly? \xc2\xa0Should not I be able to set it\r\nforth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied,\r\nand said with forced lightness--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the\r\nwoman for mine amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKept you the woman\xe2\x80\x99s pig for amusement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man answered sharply--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNought else, good sir--I tell thee \xe2\x80\x99twas but a jest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do begin to believe thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of\r\nmockery and half-conviction in his tone; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tarry thou here a\r\nmoment whilst I run and ask his worship--for nathless, he being a man\r\nexperienced in law, in jests, in--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted,\r\nspat out an oath or two, then cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, hold, good sir--prithee wait a little--the judge! \xc2\xa0Why, man, he\r\nhath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse!--come, and we\r\nwill speak further. \xc2\xa0Ods body! \xc2\xa0I seem to be in evil case--and all for\r\nan innocent and thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my\r\nwife and little ones--List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst\r\nthou of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a\r\nhundred thousand--counting slowly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hendon, with the expression of\r\na man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a very little one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my destruction!\xe2\x80\x9d said the constable despairingly.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, be\r\nreasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on all its sides, and\r\nsee how mere a jest it is--how manifestly and how plainly it is so. \xc2\xa0And\r\neven if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that\r\ne\xe2\x80\x99en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and\r\nwarning from the judge\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis jest of thine hath a name, in law,--wot you what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it not! \xc2\xa0Peradventure I have been unwise. \xc2\xa0I never dreamed it\r\nhad a name--ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it hath a name. \xc2\xa0In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis\r\nlex talionis sic transit gloria mundi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the penalty is death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be merciful to me a sinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy,\r\nthou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha\xe2\x80\x99penny, paying but\r\na trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive\r\nbarratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem\r\nexpurgatis in statu quo--and the penalty is death by the halter, without\r\nransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me! \xc2\xa0Be thou\r\nmerciful--spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see nought\r\nthat shall happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! now thou\xe2\x80\x99rt wise and reasonable. \xc2\xa0And thou\xe2\x80\x99lt restore the pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, I will indeed--nor ever touch another, though heaven send it\r\nand an archangel fetch it. \xc2\xa0Go--I am blind for thy sake--I see nothing.\r\n\xc2\xa0I will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by\r\nforce. \xc2\xa0It is but a crazy, ancient door--I will batter it down myself\r\nbetwixt midnight and the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving\r\ncharity for this poor lad, and will shed no tears and break no jailer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbones for his escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. Hendon Hall.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his\r\nMajesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and\r\nwait there, whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account.\r\nHalf an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on\r\nHendon\xe2\x80\x99s sorry steeds. \xc2\xa0The King was warm and comfortable, now, for\r\nhe had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which\r\nHendon had bought on London Bridge.\r\n\r\nHendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged that\r\nhard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of sleep would be\r\nbad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity, and moderate exercise\r\nwould be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he longed to see the stricken\r\nintellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the\r\ntormented little head; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages\r\ntoward the home whence he had so long been banished, instead of obeying\r\nthe impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day.\r\n\r\nWhen he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached a\r\nconsiderable village, and halted there for the night, at a good inn.\r\n\xc2\xa0The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed him when he was\r\nready for bed; then took the floor for his own quarters, and slept\r\nathwart the door, rolled up in a blanket.\r\n\r\nThe next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along talking\r\nover the adventures they had met since their separation, and mightily\r\nenjoying each other\xe2\x80\x99s narratives. \xc2\xa0Hendon detailed all his wide\r\nwanderings in search of the King, and described how the archangel had\r\nled him a fool\xe2\x80\x99s journey all over the forest, and taken him back to\r\nthe hut, finally, when he found he could not get rid of him. \xc2\xa0Then--he\r\nsaid--the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back\r\nlooking broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy\r\nhad returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so. \xc2\xa0Hendon\r\nhad waited at the hut all day; hope of the King\xe2\x80\x99s return died out, then,\r\nand he departed upon the quest again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd old Sanctum Sanctorum _was_ truly sorry your highness came not\r\nback,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hendon; \xe2\x80\x9cI saw it in his face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry I will never doubt _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d said the King--and then told his own\r\nstory; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel.\r\n\r\nDuring the last day of the trip, Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s spirits were soaring. His\r\ntongue ran constantly. \xc2\xa0He talked about his old father, and his brother\r\nArthur, and told of many things which illustrated their high and\r\ngenerous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith,\r\nand was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and\r\nbrotherly things about Hugh. \xc2\xa0He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting\r\nat Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would be to everybody, and what an\r\noutburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be.\r\n\r\nIt was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road\r\nled through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses, marked with\r\ngentle elevations and depressions, suggested the swelling and subsiding\r\nundulations of the sea. \xc2\xa0In the afternoon the returning prodigal made\r\nconstant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock\r\nhe might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home. \xc2\xa0At\r\nlast he was successful, and cried out excitedly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by! You\r\nmay see the towers from here; and that wood there--that is my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npark. Ah, _now_ thou\xe2\x80\x99lt know what state and grandeur be! A house with\r\nseventy rooms--think of that!--and seven and twenty servants! \xc2\xa0A brave\r\nlodging for such as we, is it not so? \xc2\xa0Come, let us speed--my impatience\r\nwill not brook further delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o\xe2\x80\x99clock before\r\nthe village was reached. \xc2\xa0The travellers scampered through it, Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntongue going all the time.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the church--covered with the same\r\nivy--none gone, none added.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cYonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,--and\r\nyonder is the market-place.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the Maypole, and here the\r\npump--nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten years\r\nmake a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but none know\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So his chat ran on. The end of the village was soon reached; then\r\nthe travellers struck into a crooked, narrow road, walled in with tall\r\nhedges, and hurried briskly along it for half a mile, then passed into a\r\nvast flower garden through an imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars\r\nbore sculptured armorial devices. \xc2\xa0A noble mansion was before them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to Hendon Hall, my King!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miles.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, \xe2\x80\x99tis a great\r\nday! \xc2\xa0My father and my brother, and the Lady Edith will be so mad with\r\njoy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first\r\ntransports of the meeting, and so thou\xe2\x80\x99lt seem but coldly welcomed--but\r\nmind it not; \xe2\x80\x99twill soon seem otherwise; for when I say thou art my\r\nward, and tell them how costly is my love for thee, thou\xe2\x80\x99lt see them\r\ntake thee to their breasts for Miles Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and make their house\r\nand hearts thy home for ever after!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door,\r\nhelped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed within. A few\r\nsteps brought him to a spacious apartment; he entered, seated the King\r\nwith more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat at a\r\nwriting-table in front of a generous fire of logs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmbrace me, Hugh,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand say thou\xe2\x80\x99rt glad I am come again! and\r\ncall our father, for home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and\r\nsee his face, and hear his voice once more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent\r\na grave stare upon the intruder--a stare which indicated somewhat of\r\noffended dignity, at first, then changed, in response to some inward\r\nthought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed with\r\na real or assumed compassion. \xc2\xa0Presently he said, in a mild voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered\r\nprivations and rude buffetings at the world\xe2\x80\x99s hands; thy looks and dress\r\nbetoken it. \xc2\xa0Whom dost thou take me to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake thee? \xc2\xa0Prithee for whom else than whom thou art? \xc2\xa0I take thee to\r\nbe Hugh Hendon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miles, sharply.\r\n\r\nThe other continued, in the same soft tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagination hath nought to do with it! \xc2\xa0Dost thou pretend thou knowest\r\nme not for thy brother Miles Hendon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s face, and he\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life? \xc2\xa0God be praised\r\nif it be so! \xc2\xa0Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these\r\ncruel years! \xc2\xa0Ah, it seems too good to be true, it _is_ too good to be\r\ntrue--I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me! \xc2\xa0Quick--come to\r\nthe light--let me scan thee well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to\r\ndevour him from head to foot with his eyes, turning him this way and\r\nthat, and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him\r\nfrom all points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with\r\ngladness, smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, brother, go on, and fear not; thou\xe2\x80\x99lt find nor limb nor feature\r\nthat cannot bide the test. \xc2\xa0Scour and scan me to thy content, my good\r\nold Hugh--I am indeed thy old Miles, thy same old Miles, thy lost\r\nbrother, is\xe2\x80\x99t not so? \xc2\xa0Ah, \xe2\x80\x99tis a great day--I _said_ \xe2\x80\x99twas a great day!\r\n\xc2\xa0Give me thy hand, give me thy cheek--lord, I am like to die of very\r\njoy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was about to throw himself upon his brother; but Hugh put up his hand\r\nin dissent, then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast, saying\r\nwith emotion--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous\r\ndisappointment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiles, amazed, could not speak for a moment; then he found his tongue,\r\nand cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ disappointment? \xc2\xa0Am I not thy brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHugh shook his head sadly, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the\r\nresemblances that are hid from mine. \xc2\xa0Alack, I fear me the letter spoke\r\nbut too truly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago. \xc2\xa0It said my\r\nbrother died in battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lie! \xc2\xa0Call thy father--he will know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne may not call the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d Miles\xe2\x80\x99s voice was subdued, and his lips trembled.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy father\r\ndead!--oh, this is heavy news. \xc2\xa0Half my new joy is withered now.\r\n\xc2\xa0Prithee let me see my brother Arthur--he will know me; he will know me\r\nand console me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, also, is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be merciful to me, a stricken man! \xc2\xa0Gone,--both gone--the worthy\r\ntaken and the worthless spared, in me! \xc2\xa0Ah! I crave your mercy!--do not\r\nsay the Lady Edith--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs dead? \xc2\xa0No, she lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, God be praised, my joy is whole again! \xc2\xa0Speed thee, brother--let\r\nher come to me! \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 _she_ say I am not myself--but she will not; no,\r\nno, _she_ will know me, I were a fool to doubt it. Bring her--bring the\r\nold servants; they, too, will know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll are gone but five--Peter, Halsey, David, Bernard, and Margaret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, Hugh left the room. \xc2\xa0Miles stood musing a while, then began\r\nto walk the floor, muttering--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and\r\nhonest--\xe2\x80\x98tis an odd thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued walking back and forth, muttering to himself; he had\r\nforgotten the King entirely. \xc2\xa0By-and-by his Majesty said gravely, and\r\nwith a touch of genuine compassion, though the words themselves were\r\ncapable of being interpreted ironically--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind not thy mischance, good man; there be others in the world whose\r\nidentity is denied, and whose claims are derided. \xc2\xa0Thou hast company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my King,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hendon, colouring slightly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not thou condemn\r\nme--wait, and thou shalt see. \xc2\xa0I am no impostor--she will say it; you\r\nshall hear it from the sweetest lips in England. \xc2\xa0I an impostor? \xc2\xa0Why, I\r\nknow this old hall, these pictures of my ancestors, and all these things\r\nthat are about us, as a child knoweth its own nursery. \xc2\xa0Here was I born\r\nand bred, my lord; I speak the truth; I would not deceive thee; and\r\nshould none else believe, I pray thee do not _thou_ doubt me--I could\r\nnot bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not doubt thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, with a childlike simplicity and\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank thee out of my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hendon with a fervency which\r\nshowed that he was touched. \xc2\xa0The King added, with the same gentle\r\nsimplicity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost thou doubt _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA guilty confusion seized upon Hendon, and he was grateful that the door\r\nopened to admit Hugh, at that moment, and saved him the necessity of\r\nreplying.\r\n\r\nA beautiful lady, richly clothed, followed Hugh, and after her came\r\nseveral liveried servants. \xc2\xa0The lady walked slowly, with her head bowed\r\nand her eyes fixed upon the floor. \xc2\xa0The face was unspeakably sad. \xc2\xa0Miles\r\nHendon sprang forward, crying out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Edith, my darling--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Hugh waved him back, gravely, and said to the lady--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook upon him. \xc2\xa0Do you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound of Miles\xe2\x80\x99s voice the woman had started slightly, and her\r\ncheeks had flushed; she was trembling now. \xc2\xa0She stood still, during an\r\nimpressive pause of several moments; then slowly lifted up her head and\r\nlooked into Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with a stony and frightened gaze; the blood\r\nsank out of her face, drop by drop, till nothing remained but the grey\r\npallor of death; then she said, in a voice as dead as the face, \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nhim not!\xe2\x80\x9d and turned, with a moan and a stifled sob, and tottered out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.\r\nAfter a pause, his brother said to the servants--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have observed him. \xc2\xa0Do you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads; then the master said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants know you not, sir. \xc2\xa0I fear there is some mistake. You have\r\nseen that my wife knew you not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy _wife_!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall, with an iron\r\ngrip about his throat.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, thou fox-hearted slave, I see it all!\r\n\xc2\xa0Thou\xe2\x80\x99st writ the lying letter thyself, and my stolen bride and goods\r\nare its fruit. \xc2\xa0There--now get thee gone, lest I shame mine honourable\r\nsoldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHugh, red-faced, and almost suffocated, reeled to the nearest chair, and\r\ncommanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger. \xc2\xa0They\r\nhesitated, and one of them said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmed! \xc2\xa0What of it, and ye so many? \xc2\xa0Upon him, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and added--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe know me of old--I have not changed; come on, an\xe2\x80\x99 it like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the doors,\r\nwhilst I send one to fetch the watch!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hugh. \xc2\xa0He turned at the\r\nthreshold, and said to Miles, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it to your advantage to\r\noffend not with useless endeavours at escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEscape? \xc2\xa0Spare thyself discomfort, an\xe2\x80\x99 that is all that troubles thee.\r\nFor Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all its belongings. \xc2\xa0He\r\nwill remain--doubt it not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. Disowned.\r\n\r\nThe King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis strange--most strange. \xc2\xa0I cannot account for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not strange, my liege. \xc2\xa0I know him, and this conduct is but\r\nnatural. \xc2\xa0He was a rascal from his birth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I spake not of _him_, Sir Miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot of him? \xc2\xa0Then of what? \xc2\xa0What is it that is strange?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the King is not missed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? \xc2\xa0Which? \xc2\xa0I doubt I do not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? \xc2\xa0Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land\r\nis not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and\r\nmaking search for me? \xc2\xa0Is it no matter for commotion and distress that\r\nthe Head of the State is gone; that I am vanished away and lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost true, my King, I had forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then Hendon sighed, and muttered to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor ruined mind--still busy with its pathetic dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have a plan that shall right us both--I will write a paper, in\r\nthree tongues--Latin, Greek and English--and thou shalt haste away with\r\nit to London in the morning. \xc2\xa0Give it to none but my uncle, the Lord\r\nHertford; when he shall see it, he will know and say I wrote it. \xc2\xa0Then\r\nhe will send for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I prove myself\r\nand make my rights secure to my domains? \xc2\xa0I should be so much the better\r\nable then to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King interrupted him imperiously--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace! \xc2\xa0What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial interests, contrasted\r\nwith matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a\r\nthrone?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then, he added, in a gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his\r\nseverity, \xe2\x80\x9cObey, and have no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee\r\nwhole--yes, more than whole. \xc2\xa0I shall remember, and requite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work. \xc2\xa0Hendon\r\ncontemplated him lovingly a while, then said to himself--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 it were dark, I should think it _was_ a king that spoke; there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno denying it, when the humour\xe2\x80\x99s upon on him he doth thunder and lighten\r\nlike your true King; now where got he that trick? \xc2\xa0See him scribble and\r\nscratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to\r\nbe Latin and Greek--and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device\r\nfor diverting him from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post\r\naway to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment Sir Miles\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts had gone back to the recent\r\nepisode. So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King presently\r\nhanded him the paper which he had been writing, he received it and\r\npocketed it without being conscious of the act. \xe2\x80\x9cHow marvellous strange\r\nshe acted,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.  \xe2\x80\x9cI think she knew me--and I think she did\r\n_not_ know me. These opinions do conflict, I perceive it plainly; I\r\ncannot reconcile them, neither can I, by argument, dismiss either of the\r\ntwo, or even persuade one to outweigh the other. \xc2\xa0The matter standeth\r\nsimply thus: she _must_ have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how\r\ncould it be otherwise? \xc2\xa0Yet she __said_ _she knew me not, and that is\r\nproof perfect, for she cannot lie. \xc2\xa0But stop--I think I begin to see.\r\nPeradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her to\r\nlie. \xc2\xa0That is the solution. \xc2\xa0The riddle is unriddled. \xc2\xa0She seemed dead\r\nwith fear--yes, she was under his compulsion. \xc2\xa0I will seek her; I will\r\nfind her; now that he is away, she will speak her true mind. \xc2\xa0She will\r\nremember the old times when we were little playfellows together, and\r\nthis will soften her heart, and she will no more betray me, but will\r\nconfess me. \xc2\xa0There is no treacherous blood in her--no, she was always\r\nhonest and true. \xc2\xa0She has loved me, in those old days--this is my\r\nsecurity; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened, and the\r\nLady Edith entered. \xc2\xa0She was very pale, but she walked with a firm step,\r\nand her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity. Her face was as\r\nsad as before.\r\n\r\nMiles sprang forward, with a happy confidence, to meet her, but she\r\nchecked him with a hardly perceptible gesture, and he stopped where he\r\nwas. \xc2\xa0She seated herself, and asked him to do likewise. Thus simply did\r\nshe take the sense of old comradeship out of him, and transform him\r\ninto a stranger and a guest. \xc2\xa0The surprise of it, the bewildering\r\nunexpectedness of it, made him begin to question, for a moment, if he\r\n_was_ the person he was pretending to be, after all. \xc2\xa0The Lady Edith\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I have come to warn you. \xc2\xa0The mad cannot be persuaded out of\r\ntheir delusions, perchance; but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid\r\nperils. \xc2\xa0I think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to\r\nyou, and therefore is not criminal--but do not tarry here with it; for\r\nhere it is dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0She looked steadily into Miles\xe2\x80\x99s face a moment,\r\nthen added, impressively, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the more dangerous for that you _are_\r\nmuch like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens, madam, but I _am_ he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI truly think you think it, sir. \xc2\xa0I question not your honesty in that;\r\nI but warn you, that is all. \xc2\xa0My husband is master in this region; his\r\npower hath hardly any limit; the people prosper or starve, as he wills.\r\nIf you resembled not the man whom you profess to be, my husband might\r\nbid you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace; but trust me, I know\r\nhim well; I know what he will do; he will say to all that you are but a\r\nmad impostor, and straightway all will echo him.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0She bent upon Miles\r\nthat same steady look once more, and added:  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you _were_ Miles\r\nHendon, and he knew it and all the region knew it--consider what I\r\nam saying, weigh it well--you would stand in the same peril, your\r\npunishment would be no less sure; he would deny you and denounce you,\r\nand none would be bold enough to give you countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost truly I believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miles, bitterly.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe power that\r\ncan command one life-long friend to betray and disown another, and be\r\nobeyed, may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are\r\non the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, and she dropped\r\nher eyes to the floor; but her voice betrayed no emotion when she\r\nproceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have warned you--I must still warn you--to go hence. \xc2\xa0This man will\r\ndestroy you, else. \xc2\xa0He is a tyrant who knows no pity. \xc2\xa0I, who am\r\nhis fettered slave, know this. \xc2\xa0Poor Miles, and Arthur, and my dear\r\nguardian, Sir Richard, are free of him, and at rest: \xc2\xa0better that\r\nyou were with them than that you bide here in the clutches of this\r\nmiscreant. \xc2\xa0Your pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions;\r\nyou have assaulted him in his own house: \xc2\xa0you are ruined if you stay.\r\n\xc2\xa0Go--do not hesitate. If you lack money, take this purse, I beg of you,\r\nand bribe the servants to let you pass. Oh, be warned, poor soul, and\r\nescape while you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrant me one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cLet your eyes rest upon mine, so that I\r\nmay see if they be steady. \xc2\xa0There--now answer me. \xc2\xa0Am I Miles Hendon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. \xc2\xa0I know you not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer was low, but distinct--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, this passes belief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFly! \xc2\xa0Why will you waste the precious time? \xc2\xa0Fly, and save yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment the officers burst into the room, and a violent struggle\r\nbegan; but Hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away. The King was\r\ntaken also, and both were bound and led to prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. In Prison.\r\n\r\nThe cells were all crowded; so the two friends were chained in a large\r\nroom where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept.\r\nThey had company, for there were some twenty manacled and fettered\r\nprisoners here, of both sexes and of varying ages,--an obscene and noisy\r\ngang. \xc2\xa0The King chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put\r\nupon his royalty, but Hendon was moody and taciturn. \xc2\xa0He was pretty\r\nthoroughly bewildered; he had come home, a jubilant prodigal, expecting\r\nto find everybody wild with joy over his return; and instead had got the\r\ncold shoulder and a jail. \xc2\xa0The promise and the fulfilment differed so\r\nwidely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether it\r\nwas most tragic or most grotesque. \xc2\xa0He felt much as a man might who had\r\ndanced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow, and got struck by lightning.\r\n\r\nBut gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into\r\nsome sort of order, and then his mind centred itself upon Edith. \xc2\xa0He\r\nturned her conduct over, and examined it in all lights, but he could not\r\nmake anything satisfactory out of it. \xc2\xa0Did she know him--or didn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\nknow him? \xc2\xa0It was a perplexing puzzle, and occupied him a long time; but\r\nhe ended, finally, with the conviction that she did know him, and had\r\nrepudiated him for interested reasons. \xc2\xa0He wanted to load her name with\r\ncurses now; but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found\r\nhe could not bring his tongue to profane it.\r\n\r\nWrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition, Hendon\r\nand the King passed a troubled night. \xc2\xa0For a bribe the jailer had\r\nfurnished liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of ribald songs,\r\nfighting, shouting, and carousing was the natural consequence. \xc2\xa0At last,\r\na while after midnight, a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by\r\nbeating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could\r\ncome to the rescue. \xc2\xa0The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound\r\nclubbing about the head and shoulders--then the carousing ceased;\r\nand after that, all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the\r\nannoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a monotonous\r\nsameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less\r\ndistinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the \xe2\x80\x98impostor\xe2\x80\x99 and repudiate\r\nand insult him; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with\r\nsymmetrical regularity. \xc2\xa0However, there was a change of incident at\r\nlast. The jailer brought in an old man, and said to him--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe villain is in this room--cast thy old eyes about and see if thou\r\ncanst say which is he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first\r\ntime since he had been in the jail. \xc2\xa0He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Blake\r\nAndrews, a servant all his life in my father\xe2\x80\x99s family--a good honest\r\nsoul, with a right heart in his breast. That is, formerly. \xc2\xa0But none are\r\ntrue now; all are liars. \xc2\xa0This man will know me--and will deny me, too,\r\nlike the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn, and\r\nfinally said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see none here but paltry knaves, scum o\xe2\x80\x99 the streets. \xc2\xa0Which is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jailer laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cscan this big animal, and grant me an opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man approached, and looked Hendon over, long and earnestly, then\r\nshook his head and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, _this_ is no Hendon--nor ever was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight! \xc2\xa0Thy old eyes are sound yet. \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 I were Sir Hugh, I would take\r\nthe shabby carle and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary\r\nhalter, at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat\r\nsuggestive of suffocation. \xc2\xa0The old man said, vindictively--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him bless God an\xe2\x80\x99 he fare no worse. \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 _I_ had the handling o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe villain he should roast, or I am no true man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him a piece of thy mind, old man--they all do it. \xc2\xa0Thou\xe2\x80\x99lt find it\r\ngood diversion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared. \xc2\xa0The old man\r\ndropped upon his knees and whispered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be thanked, thou\xe2\x80\x99rt come again, my master! \xc2\xa0I believed thou wert\r\ndead these seven years, and lo, here thou art alive! \xc2\xa0I knew thee the\r\nmoment I saw thee; and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance\r\nand seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nstreets. I am old and poor, Sir Miles; but say the word and I will go\r\nforth and proclaim the truth though I be strangled for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hendon; \xe2\x80\x9cthou shalt not. \xc2\xa0It would ruin thee, and yet help\r\nbut little in my cause. \xc2\xa0But I thank thee, for thou hast given me back\r\nsomewhat of my lost faith in my kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King; for\r\nhe dropped in several times a day to \xe2\x80\x98abuse\xe2\x80\x99 the former, and always\r\nsmuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare; he\r\nalso furnished the current news. \xc2\xa0Hendon reserved the dainties for the\r\nKing; without them his Majesty might not have survived, for he was\r\nnot able to eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer.\r\n\xc2\xa0Andrews was obliged to confine himself to brief visits, in order to\r\navoid suspicion; but he managed to impart a fair degree of information\r\neach time--information delivered in a low voice, for Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s benefit,\r\nand interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for\r\nthe benefit of other hearers.\r\n\r\nSo, little by little, the story of the family came out. \xc2\xa0Arthur had\r\nbeen dead six years. \xc2\xa0This loss, with the absence of news from Hendon,\r\nimpaired the father\xe2\x80\x99s health; he believed he was going to die, and he\r\nwished to see Hugh and Edith settled in life before he passed away; but\r\nEdith begged hard for delay, hoping for Miles\xe2\x80\x99s return; then the letter\r\ncame which brought the news of Miles\xe2\x80\x99s death; the shock prostrated Sir\r\nRichard; he believed his end was very near, and he and Hugh insisted\r\nupon the marriage; Edith begged for and obtained a month\xe2\x80\x99s respite,\r\nthen another, and finally a third; the marriage then took place by\r\nthe death-bed of Sir Richard. \xc2\xa0It had not proved a happy one. \xc2\xa0It was\r\nwhispered about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride\r\nfound among her husband\xe2\x80\x99s papers several rough and incomplete drafts of\r\nthe fatal letter, and had accused him of precipitating the marriage--and\r\nSir Richard\xe2\x80\x99s death, too--by a wicked forgery. Tales of cruelty to the\r\nLady Edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands; and since the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become\r\na pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his\r\ndomains for bread.\r\n\r\nThere was a bit of Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s gossip which the King listened to with a\r\nlively interest--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is rumour that the King is mad. \xc2\xa0But in charity forbear to say\r\n_I_ mentioned it, for \xe2\x80\x99tis death to speak of it, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis Majesty glared at the old man and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King is _not_ mad, good man--and thou\xe2\x80\x99lt find it to thy advantage\r\nto busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this\r\nseditious prattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat doth the lad mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrews, surprised at this brisk assault\r\nfrom such an unexpected quarter. \xc2\xa0Hendon gave him a sign, and he did not\r\npursue his question, but went on with his budget--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two--the 16th of\r\nthe month--and the new King will be crowned at Westminster the 20th.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMethinks they must needs find him first,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered his Majesty; then\r\nadded, confidently, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they will look to that--and so also shall I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the old man got no further--a warning sign from Hendon checked his\r\nremark. \xc2\xa0He resumed the thread of his gossip--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Hugh goeth to the coronation--and with grand hopes. \xc2\xa0He confidently\r\nlooketh to come back a peer, for he is high in favour with the Lord\r\nProtector.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Lord Protector?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his Majesty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Grace the Duke of Somerset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Duke of Somerset?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, there is but one--Seymour, Earl of Hertford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King asked sharply--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince when is _he_ a duke, and Lord Protector?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the last day of January.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd prithee who made him so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHimself and the Great Council--with help of the King.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis Majesty started violently.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe _King_!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.  \xe2\x80\x9c_What_ king,\r\ngood sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?) \xc2\xa0Sith we have\r\nbut one, \xe2\x80\x99tis not difficult to answer--his most sacred Majesty King\r\nEdward the Sixth--whom God preserve! \xc2\xa0Yea, and a dear and gracious\r\nlittle urchin is he, too; and whether he be mad or no--and they say he\r\nmendeth daily--his praises are on all men\xe2\x80\x99s lips; and all bless him,\r\nlikewise, and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in\r\nEngland; for he began humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife, and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that\r\nharry and oppress the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into\r\nso deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngossip. He wondered if the \xe2\x80\x98little urchin\xe2\x80\x99 was the beggar-boy whom\r\nhe left dressed in his own garments in the palace. \xc2\xa0It did not seem\r\npossible that this could be, for surely his manners and speech would\r\nbetray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales--then he would be\r\ndriven out, and search made for the true prince. \xc2\xa0Could it be that the\r\nCourt had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place? \xc2\xa0No, for his\r\nuncle would not allow that--he was all-powerful and could and would\r\ncrush such a movement, of course. \xc2\xa0The boy\xe2\x80\x99s musings profited him\r\nnothing; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he\r\nbecame, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept. \xc2\xa0His\r\nimpatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became almost\r\nunendurable.\r\n\r\nHendon\xe2\x80\x99s arts all failed with the King--he could not be comforted; but a\r\ncouple of women who were chained near him succeeded better. Under their\r\ngentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience.\r\n\xc2\xa0He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to delight in\r\nthe sweet and soothing influence of their presence. \xc2\xa0He asked them why\r\nthey were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled,\r\nand inquired--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? \xc2\xa0Now I grieve, for I\r\nshall lose ye--they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He\r\nsaid, eagerly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not speak; be good to me, and tell me--there will be no other\r\npunishment? \xc2\xa0Prithee tell me there is no fear of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he\r\npursued it--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill they scourge thee? \xc2\xa0No, no, they would not be so cruel! \xc2\xa0Say they\r\nwould not. \xc2\xa0Come, they _will_ not, will they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an\r\nanswer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thou\xe2\x80\x99lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!--God will help us to\r\nbear our--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a confession!\xe2\x80\x9d the King broke in.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen they _will_ scourge\r\nthee, the stony-hearted wretches! \xc2\xa0But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot\r\nbear it. \xc2\xa0Keep up thy courage--I shall come to my own in time to save\r\nthee from this bitter thing, and I will do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are saved!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, \xe2\x80\x9cbut woe\r\nis me!--for they were my comforters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token\r\nof remembrance. \xc2\xa0He said he would keep these things always; and that\r\nsoon he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them\r\nunder his protection.\r\n\r\nJust then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and commanded that\r\nthe prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard. \xc2\xa0The King was overjoyed--it\r\nwould be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air\r\nonce more. \xc2\xa0He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but\r\nhis turn came at last, and he was released from his staple and ordered\r\nto follow the other prisoners with Hendon.\r\n\r\nThe court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky. \xc2\xa0The\r\nprisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were\r\nplaced in file, standing, with their backs against the wall. A rope\r\nwas stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their\r\nofficers. It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which\r\nhad fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added\r\nto the general dismalness of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind\r\nshivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts. \xc2\xa0A glance\r\nshowed the King that these were his good friends. \xc2\xa0He shuddered, and\r\nsaid to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAlack, they are not gone free, as I had thought. \xc2\xa0To\r\nthink that such as these should know the lash!--in England! \xc2\xa0Ay, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe shame of it--not in Heathennesse, Christian England! \xc2\xa0They will be\r\nscourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must\r\nlook on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that\r\nI, the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect\r\nthem. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a\r\nday coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work.\r\n\xc2\xa0For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in. \xc2\xa0They\r\nflocked around the two women, and hid them from the King\xe2\x80\x99s view. A\r\nclergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden.\r\n\xc2\xa0The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being\r\nasked and answered, but he could not make out what was said. \xc2\xa0Next there\r\nwas a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of\r\nofficials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side\r\nof the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nNow, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a\r\nspectacle that froze the marrow in his bones. \xc2\xa0Faggots had been piled\r\nabout the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!\r\n\r\nThe women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands;\r\nthe yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling\r\nfaggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the\r\nclergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer--just then two young girls\r\ncame flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw\r\nthemselves upon the women at the stake. \xc2\xa0Instantly they were torn away\r\nby the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other\r\nbroke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could\r\nbe stopped she had flung her arms about her mother\xe2\x80\x99s neck again. \xc2\xa0She\r\nwas torn away once more, and with her gown on fire. \xc2\xa0Two or three men\r\nheld her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and\r\nthrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and\r\nsaying she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed\r\nto die with her mother. \xc2\xa0Both the girls screamed continually, and fought\r\nfor freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of\r\nheart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony--the King glanced from the\r\nfrantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face\r\nagainst the wall, and looked no more. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat which I have seen,\r\nin that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will\r\nabide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the\r\nnights, till I die. \xc2\xa0Would God I had been blind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon was watching the King. \xc2\xa0He said to himself, with satisfaction,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler. \xc2\xa0If he had\r\nfollowed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he\r\nwas King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed. \xc2\xa0Soon\r\nhis delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be\r\nwhole again. \xc2\xa0God speed the day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night,\r\nwho were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom,\r\nto undergo punishment for crimes committed. \xc2\xa0The King conversed with\r\nthese--he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself\r\nfor the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity\r\noffered--and the tale of their woes wrung his heart. \xc2\xa0One of them was\r\na poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a\r\nweaver--she was to be hanged for it. \xc2\xa0Another was a man who had been\r\naccused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had\r\nimagined that he was safe from the halter; but no--he was hardly free\r\nbefore he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King\xe2\x80\x99s park; this was\r\nproved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows. \xc2\xa0There was\r\na tradesman\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King;\r\nthis youth said he found a hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its\r\nowner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it;\r\nbut the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.\r\n\r\nThe King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break\r\njail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne\r\nand hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and\r\nsave their lives.  \xe2\x80\x9cPoor child,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Hendon, \xe2\x80\x9cthese woeful tales\r\nhave brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he\r\nwould have been well in a little time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong these prisoners was an old lawyer--a man with a strong face and a\r\ndauntless mien. \xc2\xa0Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the\r\nLord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for\r\nit by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the\r\nbar, and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for life. \xc2\xa0Lately he had repeated his offence; and in\r\nconsequence was now under sentence to lose _what remained of his ears_,\r\npay a fine of 5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in\r\nprison for life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese be honourable scars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and turned back his grey hair and\r\nshowed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears.\r\n\r\nThe King\xe2\x80\x99s eye burned with passion. \xc2\xa0He said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone believe in me--neither wilt thou. \xc2\xa0But no matter--within the\r\ncompass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have\r\ndishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the\r\nstatute books. \xc2\xa0The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to\r\ntheir own laws, at times, and so learn mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d {1}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. The sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMeantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and\r\ninaction. \xc2\xa0But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and\r\nhe thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment\r\nshould not be a part of it. \xc2\xa0But he was mistaken about that. \xc2\xa0He was in\r\na fine fury when he found himself described as a \xe2\x80\x98sturdy vagabond\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nsentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character\r\nand for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall. \xc2\xa0His pretensions as to\r\nbrothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon\r\nhonours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not\r\neven worth examination.\r\n\r\nHe raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he\r\nwas snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff,\r\nbesides, for his irreverent conduct.\r\n\r\nThe King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so\r\nhe was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and\r\nservant. \xc2\xa0The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for\r\nbeing in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a\r\nwarning, in consideration of his youth. \xc2\xa0When the crowd at last halted,\r\nhe flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting\r\na place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and\r\ndelay, succeeded. \xc2\xa0There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks,\r\nthe sport and butt of a dirty mob--he, the body servant of the King\r\nof England! \xc2\xa0Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not\r\nrealised the half that it meant. \xc2\xa0His anger began to rise as the sense\r\nof this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped\r\nto summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air\r\nand crush itself against Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, and heard the crowd roar\r\nits enjoyment of the episode. \xc2\xa0He sprang across the open circle and\r\nconfronted the officer in charge, crying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame! \xc2\xa0This is my servant--set him free! \xc2\xa0I am the--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, peace!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, \xe2\x80\x9cthou\xe2\x80\x99lt destroy thyself.\r\nMind him not, officer, he is mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I\r\nhave small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that\r\nI am well inclined.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He turned to a subordinate and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive the\r\nlittle fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a dozen will better serve his turn,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Sir Hugh, who had\r\nridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe King was seized. \xc2\xa0He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he\r\nwith the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be\r\ninflicted upon his sacred person. \xc2\xa0History was already defiled with\r\nthe record of the scourging of an English king with whips--it was an\r\nintolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful\r\npage. \xc2\xa0He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either\r\ntake this punishment or beg for its remission. \xc2\xa0Hard conditions; he\r\nwould take the stripes--a king might do that, but a king could not beg.\r\n\r\nBut meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty.  \xe2\x80\x9cLet the child\r\ngo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he\r\nis? \xc2\xa0Let him go--I will take his lashes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, a good thought--and thanks for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Hugh, his face\r\nlighting with a sardonic satisfaction.  \xe2\x80\x9cLet the little beggar go, and\r\ngive this fellow a dozen in his place--an honest dozen, well laid on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh\r\nsilenced him with the potent remark, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, speak up, do, and free thy\r\nmind--only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six\r\nstrokes the more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst\r\nthe lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and\r\nallowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, brave good\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthis loyal deed shall never perish out of\r\nmy memory. \xc2\xa0I will not forget it--and neither shall _they_!\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nwith passion. \xc2\xa0Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s magnanimous\r\nconduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and\r\nso also did his gratefulness for it. \xc2\xa0Presently he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nsaves his prince from wounds and possible death--and this he did for\r\nme--performs high service; but it is little--it is nothing--oh, less\r\nthan nothing!--when \xe2\x80\x99tis weighed against the act of him who saves his\r\nprince from _shame_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with\r\nsoldierly fortitude. \xc2\xa0This, together with his redeeming the boy by\r\ntaking his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn\r\nand degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings\r\ndied away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows.\r\n\xc2\xa0The stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once\r\nmore in the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour\r\nwhich had prevailed there so little a while before. \xc2\xa0The King came\r\nsoftly to Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s side, and whispered in his ear--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher\r\nthan kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility\r\nto men.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cEdward of England\r\ndubs thee Earl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon was touched. \xc2\xa0The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time\r\nthe grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his\r\ngravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward\r\nmirth from showing outside. \xc2\xa0To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory,\r\nfrom the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of\r\nan Earldom, seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the\r\ngrotesque. \xc2\xa0He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cNow am I finely tinselled, indeed!\r\n\xc2\xa0The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a\r\nspectre-earl--a dizzy flight for a callow wing! \xc2\xa0An\xe2\x80\x99 this go on, I\r\nshall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and\r\nmake-believe honours. \xc2\xa0But I shall value them, all valueless as\r\nthey are, for the love that doth bestow them. Better these poor mock\r\ndignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right\r\nspirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested\r\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away,\r\nthe living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed\r\ntogether again. \xc2\xa0And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture\r\na remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no\r\nmatter--the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself. \xc2\xa0A\r\nlate comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who\r\ndelivered a sneer at the \xe2\x80\x98impostor,\xe2\x80\x99 and was in the act of following it\r\nwith a dead cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any\r\nwords, and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. To London.\r\n\r\nWhen Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s term of service in the stocks was finished, he was\r\nreleased and ordered to quit the region and come back no more. His sword\r\nwas restored to him, and also his mule and his donkey. He mounted\r\nand rode off, followed by the King, the crowd opening with quiet\r\nrespectfulness to let them pass, and then dispersing when they were\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nHendon was soon absorbed in thought. \xc2\xa0There were questions of high\r\nimport to be answered. \xc2\xa0What should he do? \xc2\xa0Whither should he go?\r\nPowerful help must be found somewhere, or he must relinquish his\r\ninheritance and remain under the imputation of being an impostor\r\nbesides. \xc2\xa0Where could he hope to find this powerful help? \xc2\xa0Where,\r\nindeed! \xc2\xa0It was a knotty question. By-and-by a thought occurred to him\r\nwhich pointed to a possibility--the slenderest of slender possibilities,\r\ncertainly, but still worth considering, for lack of any other that\r\npromised anything at all. \xc2\xa0He remembered what old Andrews had said about\r\nthe young King\xe2\x80\x99s goodness and his generous championship of the wronged\r\nand unfortunate. \xc2\xa0Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for\r\njustice? \xc2\xa0Ah, yes, but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the\r\naugust presence of a monarch? Never mind--let that matter take care of\r\nitself; it was a bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should\r\ncome to it. \xc2\xa0He was an old campaigner, and used to inventing shifts and\r\nexpedients: \xc2\xa0no doubt he would be able to find a way. \xc2\xa0Yes, he would\r\nstrike for the capital. Maybe his father\xe2\x80\x99s old friend Sir Humphrey\r\nMarlow would help him--\xe2\x80\x98good old Sir Humphrey, Head Lieutenant of the\r\nlate King\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen, or stables, or something\xe2\x80\x99--Miles could not remember\r\njust what or which. \xc2\xa0Now that he had something to turn his energies to,\r\na distinctly defined object to accomplish, the fog of humiliation and\r\ndepression which had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away,\r\nand he raised his head and looked about him. \xc2\xa0He was surprised to see\r\nhow far he had come; the village was away behind him. \xc2\xa0The King was\r\njogging along in his wake, with his head bowed; for he, too, was deep\r\nin plans and thinkings. \xc2\xa0A sorrowful misgiving clouded Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s new-born\r\ncheerfulness: \xc2\xa0would the boy be willing to go again to a city where,\r\nduring all his brief life, he had never known anything but ill-usage and\r\npinching want? \xc2\xa0But the question must be asked; it could not be avoided;\r\nso Hendon reined up, and called out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound. \xc2\xa0Thy commands, my\r\nliege!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer--but astounded\r\nat it too.\r\n\r\nThe whole journey was made without an adventure of importance. But it\r\nended with one. \xc2\xa0About ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the night of the 19th of February\r\nthey stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a writhing, struggling\r\njam of howling and hurrahing people, whose beer-jolly faces stood out\r\nstrongly in the glare from manifold torches--and at that instant the\r\ndecaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between\r\nthem, striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the\r\nhurrying confusion of feet. So evanescent and unstable are men\xe2\x80\x99s works\r\nin this world!--the late good King is but three weeks dead and three\r\ndays in his grave, and already the adornments which he took such pains\r\nto select from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling. \xc2\xa0A\r\ncitizen stumbled over that head, and drove his own head into the back of\r\nsomebody in front of him, who turned and knocked down the first person\r\nthat came handy, and was promptly laid out himself by that person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend. \xc2\xa0It was the right ripe time for a free fight, for the\r\nfestivities of the morrow--Coronation Day--were already beginning;\r\neverybody was full of strong drink and patriotism; within five minutes\r\nthe free fight was occupying a good deal of ground; within ten or twelve\r\nit covered an acre of so, and was become a riot. \xc2\xa0By this time Hendon\r\nand the King were hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the\r\nrush and turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity. \xc2\xa0And so we leave\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\r\n\r\nWhilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly\r\nfed, cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves\r\nand murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by\r\nall impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nWhen we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side\r\nfor him. \xc2\xa0This bright side went on brightening more and more every\r\nday: in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and\r\ndelightfulness. \xc2\xa0He lost his fears; his misgivings faded out and died;\r\nhis embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident\r\nbearing. \xc2\xa0He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit.\r\n\r\nHe ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence\r\nwhen he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with\r\nthem, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances.\r\n\xc2\xa0It no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand\r\nat parting.\r\n\r\nHe came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed\r\nwith intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. \xc2\xa0It came to be a\r\nproud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession\r\nof officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he\r\ndoubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. \xc2\xa0He\r\nliked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the\r\ndistant voices responding, \xe2\x80\x9cWay for the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and\r\nseeming to be something more than the Lord Protector\xe2\x80\x99s mouthpiece. He\r\nliked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen\r\nto the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who\r\ncalled him brother. \xc2\xa0O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more: \xc2\xa0he found his four\r\nhundred servants too few for his proper grandeur, and trebled them. \xc2\xa0The\r\nadulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears. \xc2\xa0He\r\nremained kind and gentle, and a sturdy and determined champion of all\r\nthat were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon unjust laws: \xc2\xa0yet\r\nupon occasion, being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a\r\nduke, and give him a look that would make him tremble. \xc2\xa0Once, when his\r\nroyal \xe2\x80\x98sister,\xe2\x80\x99 the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason with\r\nhim against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who\r\nwould otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and reminded him that\r\ntheir august late father\xe2\x80\x99s prisons had sometimes contained as high as\r\nsixty thousand convicts at one time, and that during his admirable reign\r\nhe had delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death\r\nby the executioner, {9} the boy was filled with generous indignation,\r\nand commanded her to go to her closet, and beseech God to take away the\r\nstone that was in her breast, and give her a human heart.\r\n\r\nDid Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince\r\nwho had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal to\r\navenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate? Yes; his first\r\nroyal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts\r\nabout the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his return, and\r\nhappy restoration to his native rights and splendours. \xc2\xa0But as time\r\nwore on, and the prince did not come, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind became more and more\r\noccupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and\r\nlittle the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and\r\nfinally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an\r\nunwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind.\r\nAt first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see them, but\r\nlater, the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt, and\r\nbetraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down from his lofty\r\nplace, and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums,\r\nmade him shudder. \xc2\xa0At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost\r\nwholly. \xc2\xa0And he was content, even glad: \xc2\xa0for, whenever their mournful\r\nand accusing faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more\r\ndespicable than the worms that crawl.\r\n\r\nAt midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in\r\nhis rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals, and surrounded\r\nby the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow was the day appointed\r\nfor his solemn crowning as King of England. At that same hour, Edward,\r\nthe true king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled, worn with\r\ntravel, and clothed in rags and shreds--his share of the results of the\r\nriot--was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep\r\ninterest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of\r\nWestminster Abbey, busy as ants: \xc2\xa0they were making the last preparation\r\nfor the royal coronation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. The Recognition procession.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the air was heavy with a\r\nthunderous murmur: \xc2\xa0all the distances were charged with it. \xc2\xa0It was\r\nmusic to him; for it meant that the English world was out in its\r\nstrength to give loyal welcome to the great day.\r\n\r\nPresently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful\r\nfloating pageant on the Thames; for by ancient custom the \xe2\x80\x98recognition\r\nprocession\xe2\x80\x99 through London must start from the Tower, and he was bound\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived there, the sides of the venerable fortress seemed\r\nsuddenly rent in a thousand places, and from every rent leaped a\r\nred tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke; a deafening explosion\r\nfollowed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude, and made the\r\nground tremble; the flame-jets, the smoke, and the explosions, were\r\nrepeated over and over again with marvellous celerity, so that in a few\r\nmoments the old Tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke, all\r\nbut the very top of the tall pile called the White Tower; this, with\r\nits banners, stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak\r\nprojects above a cloud-rack.\r\n\r\nTom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing war-steed, whose rich\r\ntrappings almost reached to the ground; his \xe2\x80\x98uncle,\xe2\x80\x99 the Lord Protector\r\nSomerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear; the King\xe2\x80\x99s Guard\r\nformed in single ranks on either side, clad in burnished armour;\r\nafter the Protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of\r\nresplendent nobles attended by their vassals; after these came the lord\r\nmayor and the aldermanic body, in crimson velvet robes, and with their\r\ngold chains across their breasts; and after these the officers and\r\nmembers of all the guilds of London, in rich raiment, and bearing the\r\nshowy banners of the several corporations. \xc2\xa0Also in the procession, as a\r\nspecial guard of honour through the city, was the Ancient and Honourable\r\nArtillery Company--an organisation already three hundred years old\r\nat that time, and the only military body in England possessing the\r\nprivilege (which it still possesses in our day) of holding itself\r\nindependent of the commands of Parliament. \xc2\xa0It was a brilliant\r\nspectacle, and was hailed with acclamations all along the line, as it\r\ntook its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens. The\r\nchronicler says, \xe2\x80\x98The King, as he entered the city, was received by the\r\npeople with prayers, welcomings, cries, and tender words, and all signs\r\nwhich argue an earnest love of subjects toward their sovereign; and the\r\nKing, by holding up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off, and\r\nmost tender language to those that stood nigh his Grace, showed himself\r\nno less thankful to receive the people\xe2\x80\x99s goodwill than they to offer it.\r\n\xc2\xa0To all that wished him well, he gave thanks. \xc2\xa0To such as bade \xe2\x80\x9cGod save\r\nhis Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in return, \xe2\x80\x9cGod save you all!\xe2\x80\x9d and added that \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nthanked them with all his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d Wonderfully transported were the\r\npeople with the loving answers and gestures of their King.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn Fenchurch Street a \xe2\x80\x98fair child, in costly apparel,\xe2\x80\x99 stood on a stage\r\nto welcome his Majesty to the city. \xc2\xa0The last verse of his greeting was\r\nin these words--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Welcome, O King! as much as hearts can think; Welcome, again, as much\r\nas tongue can tell,--Welcome to joyous tongues, and hearts that will\r\nnot shrink: God thee preserve, we pray, and wish thee ever well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe people burst forth in a glad shout, repeating with one voice what\r\nthe child had said. \xc2\xa0Tom Canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of\r\neager faces, and his heart swelled with exultation; and he felt that\r\nthe one thing worth living for in this world was to be a king, and a\r\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s idol. \xc2\xa0Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple\r\nof his ragged Offal Court comrades--one of them the lord high admiral in\r\nhis late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the\r\nsame pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever. \xc2\xa0Oh,\r\nif they could only recognise him now! \xc2\xa0What unspeakable glory it would\r\nbe, if they could recognise him, and realise that the derided mock king\r\nof the slums and back alleys was become a real King, with illustrious\r\ndukes and princes for his humble menials, and the English world at his\r\nfeet! \xc2\xa0But he had to deny himself, and choke down his desire, for such\r\na recognition might cost more than it would come to: \xc2\xa0so he turned away\r\nhis head, and left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and\r\nglad adulations, unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then rose the cry, \xe2\x80\x9cA largess! a largess!\xe2\x80\x9d and Tom\r\nresponded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the\r\nmultitude to scramble for.\r\n\r\nThe chronicler says, \xe2\x80\x98At the upper end of Gracechurch Street, before the\r\nsign of the Eagle, the city had erected a gorgeous arch, beneath which\r\nwas a stage, which stretched from one side of the street to the other.\r\nThis was an historical pageant, representing the King\xe2\x80\x99s immediate\r\nprogenitors. \xc2\xa0There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense\r\nwhite rose, whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her; by her\r\nside was Henry VII., issuing out of a vast red rose, disposed in the\r\nsame manner: \xc2\xa0the hands of the royal pair were locked together, and the\r\nwedding-ring ostentatiously displayed. \xc2\xa0From the red and white roses\r\nproceeded a stem, which reached up to a second stage, occupied by Henry\r\nVIII., issuing from a red and white rose, with the effigy of the new\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Jane Seymour, represented by his side. \xc2\xa0One branch sprang\r\nfrom this pair, which mounted to a third stage, where sat the effigy of\r\nEdward VI. himself, enthroned in royal majesty; and the whole pageant\r\nwas framed with wreaths of roses, red and white.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people,\r\nthat their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child\r\nwhose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes. \xc2\xa0But\r\nTom Canty was not sorry; for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him\r\nthan any poetry, no matter what its quality might be. \xc2\xa0Whithersoever Tom\r\nturned his happy young face, the people recognised the exactness of his\r\neffigy\xe2\x80\x99s likeness to himself, the flesh and blood counterpart; and new\r\nwhirlwinds of applause burst forth.\r\n\r\nThe great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after\r\nanother, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical\r\ntableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or\r\nmerit, of the little King\xe2\x80\x99s.  \xe2\x80\x98Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from\r\nevery penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest\r\ncarpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets--specimens\r\nof the great wealth of the stores within; and the splendour of this\r\nthoroughfare was equalled in the other streets, and in some even\r\nsurpassed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me--me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n murmured Tom Canty.\r\n\r\nThe mock King\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were\r\nflashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. \xc2\xa0At this point,\r\njust as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught\r\nsight of a pale, astounded face, which was strained forward out of\r\nthe second rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him. \xc2\xa0A\r\nsickening consternation struck through him; he recognised his\r\nmother! and up flew his hand, palm outward, before his eyes--that old\r\ninvoluntary gesture, born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by\r\nhabit. \xc2\xa0In an instant more she had torn her way out of the press, and\r\npast the guards, and was at his side. \xc2\xa0She embraced his leg, she covered\r\nit with kisses, she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cO my child, my darling!\xe2\x80\x9d lifting toward him\r\na face that was transfigured with joy and love. \xc2\xa0The same instant an\r\nofficer of the King\xe2\x80\x99s Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent\r\nher reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his\r\nstrong arm. \xc2\xa0The words \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know you, woman!\xe2\x80\x9d were falling from Tom\r\nCanty\xe2\x80\x99s lips when this piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the\r\nheart to see her treated so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of\r\nhim, whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so\r\nwounded, so broken-hearted, that a shame fell upon him which consumed\r\nhis pride to ashes, and withered his stolen royalty. \xc2\xa0His grandeurs were\r\nstricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.\r\n\r\nThe procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting\r\nsplendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty\r\nthey were as if they had not been. \xc2\xa0He neither saw nor heard. \xc2\xa0Royalty\r\nhad lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach.\r\n\xc2\xa0Remorse was eating his heart out. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWould God I were free of\r\nmy captivity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days\r\nof his compulsory greatness.\r\n\r\nThe shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable\r\nserpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city, and through the\r\nhuzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes,\r\nseeing only his mother\xe2\x80\x99s face and that wounded look in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLargess, largess!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The cry fell upon an unheeding ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live Edward of England!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It seemed as if the earth shook with the\r\nexplosion; but there was no response from the King. \xc2\xa0He heard it only as\r\none hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a\r\ngreat distance, for it was smothered under another sound which was still\r\nnearer, in his own breast, in his accusing conscience--a voice which\r\nkept repeating those shameful words, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know you, woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words smote upon the King\xe2\x80\x99s soul as the strokes of a funeral bell\r\nsmite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret\r\ntreacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone.\r\n\r\nNew glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new marvels,\r\nsprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released;\r\nnew raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes: \xc2\xa0but the\r\nKing gave no sign, and the accusing voice that went moaning through his\r\ncomfortless breast was all the sound he heard.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little,\r\nand became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety: \xc2\xa0an\r\nabatement in the volume of the applause was observable too. \xc2\xa0The Lord\r\nProtector was quick to notice these things: \xc2\xa0he was as quick to detect\r\nthe cause. \xc2\xa0He spurred to the King\xe2\x80\x99s side, bent low in his saddle,\r\nuncovered, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy liege, it is an ill time for dreaming. \xc2\xa0The people observe thy\r\ndowncast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for an omen. \xc2\xa0Be\r\nadvised: \xc2\xa0unveil the sun of royalty, and let it shine upon these boding\r\nvapours, and disperse them. \xc2\xa0Lift up thy face, and smile upon the\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left, then\r\nretired to his place. \xc2\xa0The mock King did mechanically as he had been\r\nbidden. \xc2\xa0His smile had no heart in it, but few eyes were near enough\r\nor sharp enough to detect that. \xc2\xa0The noddings of his plumed head as he\r\nsaluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness; the largess\r\nwhich he delivered from his hand was royally liberal: \xc2\xa0so the people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanxiety vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a\r\nvolume as before.\r\n\r\nStill once more, a little before the progress was ended, the Duke was\r\nobliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance. \xc2\xa0He whispered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dread sovereign! shake off these fatal humours; the eyes of the world\r\nare upon thee.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then he added with sharp annoyance, \xe2\x80\x9cPerdition catch\r\nthat crazy pauper! \xe2\x80\x99twas she that hath disturbed your Highness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke, and said in a\r\ndead voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was my mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward to his\r\npost, \xe2\x80\x9cthe omen was pregnant with prophecy. \xc2\xa0He is gone mad again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. Coronation Day.\r\n\r\nLet us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves in Westminster\r\nAbbey, at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day.\r\n\xc2\xa0We are not without company; for although it is still night, we find\r\nthe torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well\r\ncontent to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall\r\ncome for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their\r\nlives--the coronation of a King. \xc2\xa0Yes, London and Westminster have been\r\nastir ever since the warning guns boomed at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and already\r\ncrowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying\r\nto find sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances\r\nreserved for their sort.\r\n\r\nThe hours drag along tediously enough. \xc2\xa0All stir has ceased for some\r\ntime, for every gallery has long ago been packed. \xc2\xa0We may sit, now, and\r\nlook and think at our leisure. \xc2\xa0We have glimpses, here and there\r\nand yonder, through the dim cathedral twilight, of portions of many\r\ngalleries and balconies, wedged full with other people, the other\r\nportions of these galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by\r\nintervening pillars and architectural projections. \xc2\xa0We have in view\r\nthe whole of the great north transept--empty, and waiting for England\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivileged ones. \xc2\xa0We see also the ample area or platform, carpeted with\r\nrich stuffs, whereon the throne stands. \xc2\xa0The throne occupies the centre\r\nof the platform, and is raised above it upon an elevation of four steps.\r\nWithin the seat of the throne is enclosed a rough flat rock--the stone\r\nof Scone--which many generations of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned,\r\nand so it in time became holy enough to answer a like purpose for\r\nEnglish monarchs. \xc2\xa0Both the throne and its footstool are covered with\r\ncloth of gold.\r\n\r\nStillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags heavily.\r\nBut at last the lagging daylight asserts itself, the torches are\r\nextinguished, and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces. All\r\nfeatures of the noble building are distinct now, but soft and dreamy,\r\nfor the sun is lightly veiled with clouds.\r\n\r\nAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs; for on\r\nthe stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept, clothed\r\nlike Solomon for splendour, and is conducted to her appointed place\r\nby an official clad in satins and velvets, whilst a duplicate of him\r\ngathers up the lady\xe2\x80\x99s long train, follows after, and, when the lady is\r\nseated, arranges the train across her lap for her. \xc2\xa0He then places her\r\nfootstool according to her desire, after which he puts her coronet where\r\nit will be convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous\r\ncoroneting of the nobles shall arrive.\r\n\r\nBy this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream, and\r\nthe satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere, seating\r\nthem and making them comfortable. \xc2\xa0The scene is animated enough now.\r\n\xc2\xa0There is stir and life, and shifting colour everywhere. \xc2\xa0After a time,\r\nquiet reigns again; for the peeresses are all come and are all in their\r\nplaces, a solid acre or such a matter, of human flowers, resplendent in\r\nvariegated colours, and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds. \xc2\xa0There\r\nare all ages here: brown, wrinkled, white-haired dowagers who are able\r\nto go back, and still back, down the stream of time, and recall the\r\ncrowning of Richard III. and the troublous days of that old forgotten\r\nage; and there are handsome middle-aged dames; and lovely and gracious\r\nyoung matrons; and gentle and beautiful young girls, with beaming eyes\r\nand fresh complexions, who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets\r\nawkwardly when the great time comes; for the matter will be new to\r\nthem, and their excitement will be a sore hindrance. Still, this may\r\nnot happen, for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a\r\nspecial view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its\r\nplace when the signal comes.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with\r\ndiamonds, and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle--but now we\r\nare about to be astonished in earnest. \xc2\xa0About nine, the clouds suddenly\r\nbreak away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and\r\ndrifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches\r\nflames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle\r\nto our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by\r\nthe surprise and the beauty of the spectacle! \xc2\xa0Presently a special envoy\r\nfrom some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general body\r\nof foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we catch our\r\nbreath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is\r\nso overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems, and his\r\nslightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him.\r\n\r\nLet us change the tense for convenience. \xc2\xa0The time drifted along--one\r\nhour--two hours--two hours and a half; then the deep booming of\r\nartillery told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at\r\nlast; so the waiting multitude rejoiced. \xc2\xa0All knew that a further delay\r\nmust follow, for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn\r\nceremony; but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling\r\nof the peers of the realm in their stately robes. \xc2\xa0These were conducted\r\nceremoniously to their seats, and their coronets placed conveniently\r\nat hand; and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with\r\ninterest, for most of them were beholding for the first time, dukes,\r\nearls, and barons, whose names had been historical for five hundred\r\nyears. \xc2\xa0When all were finally seated, the spectacle from the galleries\r\nand all coigns of vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to look upon and\r\nto remember.\r\n\r\nNow the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their\r\nattendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places;\r\nthese were followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials, and\r\nthese again by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard.\r\n\r\nThere was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal of music\r\nburst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold,\r\nappeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform. \xc2\xa0The entire multitude\r\nrose, and the ceremony of the Recognition ensued.\r\n\r\nThen a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of sound; and\r\nthus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to the throne.\r\n\xc2\xa0The ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive solemnity, whilst the\r\naudience gazed; and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion, Tom\r\nCanty grew pale, and still paler, and a deep and steadily deepening woe\r\nand despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAt last the final act was at hand. \xc2\xa0The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted\r\nup the crown of England from its cushion and held it out over the\r\ntrembling mock-King\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xc2\xa0In the same instant a rainbow-radiance\r\nflashed along the spacious transept; for with one impulse every\r\nindividual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised\r\nit over his or her head--and paused in that attitude.\r\n\r\nA deep hush pervaded the Abbey. \xc2\xa0At this impressive moment, a startling\r\napparition intruded upon the scene--an apparition observed by none in\r\nthe absorbed multitude, until it suddenly appeared, moving up the great\r\ncentral aisle. \xc2\xa0It was a boy, bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in\r\ncoarse plebeian garments that were falling to rags. \xc2\xa0He raised his hand\r\nwith a solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect,\r\nand delivered this note of warning--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited head. \xc2\xa0I\r\nam the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy; but in\r\nthe same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a swift step\r\nforward, and cried out in a ringing voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoose him and forbear! \xc2\xa0He _is_ the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they partly\r\nrose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and\r\nat the chief figures in this scene, like persons who wondered whether\r\nthey were awake and in their senses, or asleep and dreaming. \xc2\xa0The Lord\r\nProtector was as amazed as the rest, but quickly recovered himself, and\r\nexclaimed in a voice of authority--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again--seize the\r\nvagabond!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would have been obeyed, but the mock-King stamped his foot and cried\r\nout--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your peril! \xc2\xa0Touch him not, he is the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no one moved,\r\nno one spoke; indeed, no one knew how to act or what to say, in so\r\nstrange and surprising an emergency. \xc2\xa0While all minds were struggling to\r\nright themselves, the boy still moved steadily forward, with high port\r\nand confident mien; he had never halted from the beginning; and while\r\nthe tangled minds still floundered helplessly, he stepped upon the\r\nplatform, and the mock-King ran with a glad face to meet him; and fell\r\non his knees before him and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my lord the King, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear fealty to\r\nthee, and say, \xe2\x80\x98Put on thy crown and enter into thine own again!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector\xe2\x80\x99s eye fell sternly upon the new-comer\xe2\x80\x99s face; but\r\nstraightway the sternness vanished away, and gave place to an expression\r\nof wondering surprise. \xc2\xa0This thing happened also to the other great\r\nofficers. \xc2\xa0They glanced at each other, and retreated a step by a common\r\nand unconscious impulse. \xc2\xa0The thought in each mind was the same:  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\na strange resemblance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity, then he\r\nsaid, with grave respectfulness--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy your favour, sir, I desire to ask certain questions which--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer them, my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke asked him many questions about the Court, the late King, the\r\nprince, the princesses--the boy answered them correctly and without\r\nhesitating. \xc2\xa0He described the rooms of state in the palace, the late\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s apartments, and those of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nIt was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable--so all said\r\nthat heard it. \xc2\xa0The tide was beginning to turn, and Tom Canty\xe2\x80\x99s hopes to\r\nrun high, when the Lord Protector shook his head and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true it is most wonderful--but it is no more than our lord the\r\nKing likewise can do.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0This remark, and this reference to himself as\r\nstill the King, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his hopes crumbling from\r\nunder him.  \xe2\x80\x9cThese are not _proofs_,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Protector.\r\n\r\nThe tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed--but in the wrong\r\ndirection; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne,\r\nand sweeping the other out to sea. \xc2\xa0The Lord Protector communed with\r\nhimself--shook his head--the thought forced itself upon him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nperilous to the State and to us all, to entertain so fateful a riddle as\r\nthis; it could divide the nation and undermine the throne.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He turned\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas, arrest this--No, hold!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0His face lighted, and he\r\nconfronted the ragged candidate with this question--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere lieth the Great Seal? \xc2\xa0Answer me this truly, and the riddle is\r\nunriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales _can_ so answer! On so\r\ntrivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a lucky thought, a happy thought. \xc2\xa0That it was so considered by\r\nthe great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from\r\neye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances.\r\nYes, none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the\r\nvanished Great Seal--this forlorn little impostor had been taught his\r\nlesson well, but here his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself\r\ncould not answer _that_ question--ah, very good, very good indeed;\r\nnow we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in\r\nshort order! And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with\r\nsatisfaction, and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy\r\nof guilty confusion. How surprised they were, then, to see nothing of\r\nthe sort happen--how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly, in a\r\nconfident and untroubled voice, and say--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nought in this riddle that is difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Then, without so\r\nmuch as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and gave this command,\r\nwith the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things: \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord\r\nSt. John, go you to my private cabinet in the palace--for none knoweth\r\nthe place better than you--and, close down to the floor, in the left\r\ncorner remotest from the door that opens from the ante-chamber, you\r\nshall find in the wall a brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little\r\njewel-closet will fly open which not even you do know of--no, nor\r\nany soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did\r\ncontrive it for me. The first thing that falleth under your eye will be\r\nthe Great Seal--fetch it hither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still more to see\r\nthe little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent\r\nfear of mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly convincing\r\nair of having known him all his life. \xc2\xa0The peer was almost surprised\r\ninto obeying. \xc2\xa0He even made a movement as if to go, but quickly\r\nrecovered his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush.\r\n\xc2\xa0Tom Canty turned upon him and said, sharply--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy dost thou hesitate? \xc2\xa0Hast not heard the King\xe2\x80\x99s command? \xc2\xa0Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. John made a deep obeisance--and it was observed that it was\r\na significantly cautious and non-committal one, it not being delivered\r\nat either of the kings, but at the neutral ground about half-way between\r\nthe two--and took his leave.\r\n\r\nNow began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group\r\nwhich was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady and persistent--a\r\nmovement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly,\r\nwhereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join\r\nthemselves to another--a movement which, little by little, in the\r\npresent case, dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty\r\nand clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new-comer.\r\n\xc2\xa0Tom Canty stood almost alone. Now ensued a brief season of deep\r\nsuspense and waiting--during which even the few faint hearts still\r\nremaining near Tom Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to\r\nglide, one by one, over to the majority. \xc2\xa0So at last Tom Canty, in his\r\nroyal robes and jewels, stood wholly alone and isolated from the world,\r\na conspicuous figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy.\r\n\r\nNow the Lord St. John was seen returning. \xc2\xa0As he advanced up\r\nthe mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of\r\nconversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by\r\na profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which his footfalls\r\npulsed with a dull and distant sound. \xc2\xa0Every eye was fastened upon him\r\nas he moved along. \xc2\xa0He reached the platform, paused a moment, then moved\r\ntoward Tom Canty with a deep obeisance, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, the Seal is not there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient with more\r\nhaste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from\r\nthe presence of the shabby little claimant of the Crown. \xc2\xa0In a moment\r\nhe stood all alone, without friend or supporter, a target upon which\r\nwas concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks. \xc2\xa0The Lord\r\nProtector called out fiercely--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through the town--the\r\npaltry knave is worth no more consideration!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOfficers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty waved them\r\noff and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack! \xc2\xa0Whoso touches him perils his life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree. \xc2\xa0He said to the\r\nLord St. John--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSearched you well?--but it boots not to ask that. \xc2\xa0It doth seem passing\r\nstrange. \xc2\xa0Little things, trifles, slip out of one\xe2\x80\x99s ken, and one does\r\nnot think it matter for surprise; but how so bulky a thing as the\r\nSeal of England can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it\r\nagain--a massy golden disk--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, that is enough! \xc2\xa0Was it round?--and thick?--and had it letters\r\nand devices graved upon it?--yes? \xc2\xa0Oh, _now_ I know what this Great Seal\r\nis that there\xe2\x80\x99s been such worry and pother about. An\xe2\x80\x99 ye had described\r\nit to me, ye could have had it three weeks ago. \xc2\xa0Right well I know where\r\nit lies; but it was not I that put it there--first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, then, my liege?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Lord Protector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe that stands there--the rightful King of England. \xc2\xa0And he shall tell\r\nyou himself where it lies--then you will believe he knew it of his own\r\nknowledge. \xc2\xa0Bethink thee, my King--spur thy memory--it was the last, the\r\nvery _last_ thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from\r\nthe palace, clothed in my rags, to punish the soldier that insulted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper, and all eyes\r\nwere fixed upon the new-comer, who stood, with bent head and corrugated\r\nbrow, groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless\r\nrecollections for one single little elusive fact, which, found, would\r\nseat him upon a throne--unfound, would leave him as he was, for good and\r\nall--a pauper and an outcast. \xc2\xa0Moment after moment passed--the moments\r\nbuilt themselves into minutes--still the boy struggled silently on, and\r\ngave no sign. \xc2\xa0But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his head slowly, and\r\nsaid, with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call the scene back--all of it--but the Seal hath no place in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xc2\xa0He paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lords and\r\ngentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of\r\nthis evidence which he is not able to furnish, I may not stay ye, being\r\npowerless. \xc2\xa0But--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, folly, oh, madness, my King!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom Canty, in a panic,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwait!--think! \xc2\xa0Do not give up!--the cause is not lost! \xc2\xa0Nor _shall_ be,\r\nneither! List to what I say--follow every word--I am going to bring that\r\nmorning back again, every hap just as it happened. \xc2\xa0We talked--I told\r\nyou of my sisters, Nan and Bet--ah, yes, you remember that; and about\r\nmine old grandam--and the rough games of the lads of Offal Court--yes,\r\nyou remember these things also; very well, follow me still, you shall\r\nrecall everything. \xc2\xa0You gave me food and drink, and did with princely\r\ncourtesy send away the servants, so that my low breeding might not shame\r\nme before them--ah, yes, this also you remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his head in\r\nrecognition of them, the great audience and the officials stared in\r\npuzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history, yet how could\r\nthis impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar-boy have come\r\nabout? \xc2\xa0Never was a company of people so perplexed, so interested, and\r\nso stupefied, before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments. \xc2\xa0Then we stood before\r\na mirror; and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had\r\nbeen no change made--yes, you remember that. \xc2\xa0Then you noticed that the\r\nsoldier had hurt my hand--look! here it is, I cannot yet even write with\r\nit, the fingers are so stiff. \xc2\xa0At this your Highness sprang up, vowing\r\nvengeance upon that soldier, and ran towards the door--you passed a\r\ntable--that thing you call the Seal lay on that table--you snatched\r\nit up and looked eagerly about, as if for a place to hide it--your eye\r\ncaught sight of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, \xe2\x80\x99tis sufficient!--and the good God be thanked!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nragged claimant, in a mighty excitement.  \xe2\x80\x9cGo, my good St. John--in an\r\narm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall, thou\xe2\x80\x99lt find\r\nthe Seal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, my King! right!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom Canty; \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ the sceptre of England\r\nis thine own; and it were better for him that would dispute it that he\r\nhad been born dumb! \xc2\xa0Go, my Lord St. John, give thy feet wings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh out of its mind\r\nwith uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming excitement. \xc2\xa0On the floor\r\nand on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst\r\nforth, and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was\r\ninterested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear,\r\nor he was shouting into his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s ear. \xc2\xa0Time--nobody knew how much\r\nof it--swept by unheeded and unnoted. \xc2\xa0At last a sudden hush fell upon\r\nthe house, and in the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform,\r\nand held the Great Seal aloft in his hand. \xc2\xa0Then such a shout went up--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live the true King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical\r\ninstruments, and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs; and\r\nthrough it all a ragged lad, the most conspicuous figure in England,\r\nstood, flushed and happy and proud, in the centre of the spacious\r\nplatform, with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him.\r\n\r\nThen all rose, and Tom Canty cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, O my King, take these regal garments back, and give poor Tom, thy\r\nservant, his shreds and remnants again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector spoke up--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the new King, the true King, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not have it so. \xc2\xa0But for him I had not got my crown again--none\r\nshall lay a hand upon him to harm him. \xc2\xa0And as for thee, my good uncle,\r\nmy Lord Protector, this conduct of thine is not grateful toward\r\nthis poor lad, for I hear he hath made thee a duke\xe2\x80\x9d--the Protector\r\nblushed--\xe2\x80\x9cyet he was not a king; wherefore what is thy fine title\r\nworth now? \xc2\xa0To-morrow you shall sue to me, _through him_, for its\r\nconfirmation, else no duke, but a simple earl, shalt thou remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder this rebuke, his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a little from\r\nthe front for the moment. \xc2\xa0The King turned to Tom, and said kindly--\xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\npoor boy, how was it that you could remember where I hid the Seal when I\r\ncould not remember it myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my King, that was easy, since I used it divers days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsed it--yet could not explain where it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know it was _that_ they wanted. \xc2\xa0They did not describe it,\r\nyour Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how used you it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe red blood began to steal up into Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, and he dropped his\r\neyes and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak up, good lad, and fear nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow used you\r\nthe Great Seal of England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom stammered a moment, in a pathetic confusion, then got it out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo crack nuts with!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him\r\noff his feet. \xc2\xa0But if a doubt remained in any mind that Tom Canty was\r\nnot the King of England and familiar with the august appurtenances of\r\nroyalty, this reply disposed of it utterly.\r\n\r\nMeantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders to the King\xe2\x80\x99s, whose rags were effectually hidden from sight\r\nunder it. \xc2\xa0Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed; the true King\r\nwas anointed and the crown set upon his head, whilst cannon thundered\r\nthe news to the city, and all London seemed to rock with applause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. Edward as King.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on\r\nLondon Bridge--he was more so when he got out of it. \xc2\xa0He had but little\r\nmoney when he got in, none at all when he got out. \xc2\xa0The pickpockets had\r\nstripped him of his last farthing.\r\n\r\nBut no matter, so he found his boy. \xc2\xa0Being a soldier, he did not go at\r\nhis task in a random way, but set to work, first of all, to arrange his\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nWhat would the boy naturally do? \xc2\xa0Where would he naturally go?\r\nWell--argued Miles--he would naturally go to his former haunts, for that\r\nis the instinct of unsound minds, when homeless and forsaken, as well\r\nas of sound ones. \xc2\xa0Whereabouts were his former haunts? \xc2\xa0His rags,\r\ntaken together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even\r\nclaimed to be his father, indicated that his home was in one or another\r\nof the poorest and meanest districts of London. \xc2\xa0Would the search for\r\nhim be difficult, or long? \xc2\xa0No, it was likely to be easy and brief. \xc2\xa0He\r\nwould not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in the centre of\r\na big crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he should find his poor\r\nlittle friend, sure; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself\r\nwith pestering and aggravating the boy, who would be proclaiming himself\r\nKing, as usual. \xc2\xa0Then Miles Hendon would cripple some of those people,\r\nand carry off his little ward, and comfort and cheer him with loving\r\nwords, and the two would never be separated any more.\r\n\r\nSo Miles started on his quest. \xc2\xa0Hour after hour he tramped through back\r\nalleys and squalid streets, seeking groups and crowds, and finding no\r\nend of them, but never any sign of the boy. \xc2\xa0This greatly surprised him,\r\nbut did not discourage him. \xc2\xa0To his notion, there was nothing the matter\r\nwith his plan of campaign; the only miscalculation about it was that the\r\ncampaign was becoming a lengthy one, whereas he had expected it to be\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight arrived, at last, he had made many a mile, and canvassed\r\nmany a crowd, but the only result was that he was tolerably tired,\r\nrather hungry and very sleepy. \xc2\xa0He wanted some breakfast, but there was\r\nno way to get it. \xc2\xa0To beg for it did not occur to him; as to pawning\r\nhis sword, he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour;\r\nhe could spare some of his clothes--yes, but one could as easily find a\r\ncustomer for a disease as for such clothes.\r\n\r\nAt noon he was still tramping--among the rabble which followed after\r\nthe royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal display would\r\nattract his little lunatic powerfully. \xc2\xa0He followed the pageant through\r\nall its devious windings about London, and all the way to Westminster\r\nand the Abbey. \xc2\xa0He drifted here and there amongst the multitudes\r\nthat were massed in the vicinity for a weary long time, baffled and\r\nperplexed, and finally wandered off, thinking, and trying to contrive\r\nsome way to better his plan of campaign. \xc2\xa0By-and-by, when he came to\r\nhimself out of his musings, he discovered that the town was far behind\r\nhim and that the day was growing old. \xc2\xa0He was near the river, and in the\r\ncountry; it was a region of fine rural seats--not the sort of district\r\nto welcome clothes like his.\r\n\r\nIt was not at all cold; so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee\r\nof a hedge to rest and think. \xc2\xa0Drowsiness presently began to settle upon\r\nhis senses; the faint and far-off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear,\r\nand he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThe new King is crowned,\xe2\x80\x9d and straightway fell\r\nasleep. \xc2\xa0He had not slept or rested, before, for more than thirty hours.\r\nHe did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning.\r\n\r\nHe got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the river,\r\nstayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged off toward\r\nWestminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time.\r\n\xc2\xa0Hunger helped him to a new plan, now; he would try to get speech with\r\nold Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks, and--but that was enough\r\nof a plan for the present; it would be time enough to enlarge it when\r\nthis first stage should be accomplished.\r\n\r\nToward eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock he approached the palace; and although a host of\r\nshowy people were about him, moving in the same direction, he was not\r\ninconspicuous--his costume took care of that. \xc2\xa0He watched these people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might\r\nbe willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant--as to trying to get\r\ninto the palace himself, that was simply out of the question.\r\n\r\nPresently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and scanned\r\nhis figure well, saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 that is not the very vagabond\r\nhis Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an ass--though belike I\r\nwas that before. \xc2\xa0He answereth the description to a rag--that God should\r\nmake two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition. \xc2\xa0I\r\nwould I could contrive an excuse to speak with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then, as a man\r\ngenerally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from\r\nbehind; and observing a strong interest in the boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, he stepped\r\ntoward him and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have just come out from the palace; do you belong there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow you Sir Humphrey Marlow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy started, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cLord! mine old departed father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then he answered aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cRight well, your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood--is he within?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy; and added, to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin his grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say\r\na word in his ear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without--I shall be\r\ngreatly bounden to you, my good lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy looked disappointed.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe King did not name him so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it mattereth not, this is his twin brother, and can give\r\nhis Majesty news of t\xe2\x80\x99other Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So he said\r\nto Miles, \xe2\x80\x9cStep in there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you\r\nword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon retired to the place indicated--it was a recess sunk in the\r\npalace wall, with a stone bench in it--a shelter for sentinels in bad\r\nweather. He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers, in charge\r\nof an officer, passed by. \xc2\xa0The officer saw him, halted his men, and\r\ncommanded Hendon to come forth. \xc2\xa0He obeyed, and was promptly arrested\r\nas a suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace.\r\n\xc2\xa0Things began to look ugly. \xc2\xa0Poor Miles was going to explain, but the\r\nofficer roughly silenced him, and ordered his men to disarm him and\r\nsearch him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod of his mercy grant that they find somewhat,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Miles; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave searched enow, and failed, yet is my need greater than theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing was found but a document. \xc2\xa0The officer tore it open, and Hendon\r\nsmiled when he recognised the \xe2\x80\x98pot-hooks\xe2\x80\x99 made by his lost little friend\r\nthat black day at Hendon Hall. \xc2\xa0The officer\xe2\x80\x99s face grew dark as he read\r\nthe English paragraph, and Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother new claimant of the Crown!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the officer.  \xe2\x80\x9cVerily they\r\nbreed like rabbits, to-day. \xc2\xa0Seize the rascal, men, and see ye keep\r\nhim fast whilst I convey this precious paper within and send it to the\r\nKing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow is my evil luck ended at last,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Hendon, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I shall\r\ndangle at a rope\xe2\x80\x99s end for a certainty, by reason of that bit of\r\nwriting. \xc2\xa0And what will become of my poor lad!--ah, only the good God\r\nknoweth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so he\r\nplucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as became a\r\nman. \xc2\xa0The officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his\r\nsword to him; then bowed respectfully, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease you, sir, to follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHendon followed, saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I were not travelling to death\r\nand judgment, and so must needs economise in sin, I would throttle this\r\nknave for his mock courtesy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two traversed a populous court, and arrived at the grand entrance of\r\nthe palace, where the officer, with another bow, delivered Hendon into\r\nthe hands of a gorgeous official, who received him with profound respect\r\nand led him forward through a great hall, lined on both sides with rows\r\nof splendid flunkeys (who made reverential obeisance as the two passed\r\nalong, but fell into death-throes of silent laughter at our stately\r\nscarecrow the moment his back was turned), and up a broad staircase,\r\namong flocks of fine folk, and finally conducted him into a vast room,\r\nclove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of England, then\r\nmade a bow, reminded him to take his hat off, and left him standing in\r\nthe middle of the room, a mark for all eyes, for plenty of indignant\r\nfrowns, and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon was entirely bewildered. \xc2\xa0There sat the young King, under\r\na canopy of state, five steps away, with his head bent down and aside,\r\nspeaking with a sort of human bird of paradise--a duke, maybe. \xc2\xa0Hendon\r\nobserved to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death\r\nin the full vigour of life, without having this peculiarly public\r\nhumiliation added. \xc2\xa0He wished the King would hurry about it--some of the\r\ngaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive. \xc2\xa0At this moment\r\nthe King raised his head slightly, and Hendon caught a good view of his\r\nface. The sight nearly took his breath away!--He stood gazing at the\r\nfair young face like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo, the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe muttered some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling; then\r\nturned his eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng and the\r\nsplendid saloon, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cBut these are _real_--verily these are\r\n_real_--surely it is not a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared at the King again--and thought, \xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ it a dream . . . or _is_\r\nhe the veritable Sovereign of England, and not the friendless poor Tom\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 Bedlam I took him for--who shall solve me this riddle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall, gathered up\r\na chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and sat down in it!\r\n\r\nA buzz of indignation broke out, a rough hand was laid upon him and a\r\nvoice exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp, thou mannerless clown! would\xe2\x80\x99st sit in the presence of the King?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe disturbance attracted his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s attention, who stretched forth\r\nhis hand and cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouch him not, it is his right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe throng fell back, stupefied. \xc2\xa0The King went on--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLearn ye all, ladies, lords, and gentlemen, that this is my trusty and\r\nwell-beloved servant, Miles Hendon, who interposed his good sword and\r\nsaved his prince from bodily harm and possible death--and for this he is\r\na knight, by the King\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xc2\xa0Also learn, that for a higher service,\r\nin that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame, taking these upon\r\nhimself, he is a peer of England, Earl of Kent, and shall have gold\r\nand lands meet for the dignity. \xc2\xa0More--the privilege which he hath just\r\nexercised is his by royal grant; for we have ordained that the chiefs\r\nof his line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the\r\nMajesty of England henceforth, age after age, so long as the crown shall\r\nendure. \xc2\xa0Molest him not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo persons, who, through delay, had only arrived from the country\r\nduring this morning, and had now been in this room only five minutes,\r\nstood listening to these words and looking at the King, then at the\r\nscarecrow, then at the King again, in a sort of torpid bewilderment.\r\n\xc2\xa0These were Sir Hugh and the Lady Edith. \xc2\xa0But the new Earl did not\r\nsee them. \xc2\xa0He was still staring at the monarch, in a dazed way, and\r\nmuttering--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, body o\xe2\x80\x99 me! \xc2\xa0_this_ my pauper! \xc2\xa0This my lunatic! \xc2\xa0This is he whom\r\n_I_ would show what grandeur was, in my house of seventy rooms and\r\nseven-and-twenty servants! \xc2\xa0This is he who had never known aught but\r\nrags for raiment, kicks for comfort, and offal for diet! \xc2\xa0This is he\r\nwhom _I_ adopted and would make respectable! Would God I had a bag to\r\nhide my head in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen his manners suddenly came back to him, and he dropped upon his\r\nknees, with his hands between the King\xe2\x80\x99s, and swore allegiance and did\r\nhomage for his lands and titles. \xc2\xa0Then he rose and stood respectfully\r\naside, a mark still for all eyes--and much envy, too.\r\n\r\nNow the King discovered Sir Hugh, and spoke out with wrathful voice and\r\nkindling eye--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrip this robber of his false show and stolen estates, and put him\r\nunder lock and key till I have need of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Hugh was led away.\r\n\r\nThere was a stir at the other end of the room, now; the assemblage fell\r\napart, and Tom Canty, quaintly but richly clothed, marched down, between\r\nthese living walls, preceded by an usher. \xc2\xa0He knelt before the King, who\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have learned the story of these past few weeks, and am well pleased\r\nwith thee. \xc2\xa0Thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and\r\nmercy. \xc2\xa0Thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again? \xc2\xa0Good; they\r\nshall be cared for--and thy father shall hang, if thou desire it and the\r\nlaw consent. \xc2\xa0Know, all ye that hear my voice, that from this day, they\r\nthat abide in the shelter of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital and share the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbounty shall have their minds and hearts fed, as well as their baser\r\nparts; and this boy shall dwell there, and hold the chief place in its\r\nhonourable body of governors, during life. \xc2\xa0And for that he hath been\r\na king, it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due;\r\nwherefore note this his dress of state, for by it he shall be known, and\r\nnone shall copy it; and wheresoever he shall come, it shall remind the\r\npeople that he hath been royal, in his time, and none shall deny him his\r\ndue of reverence or fail to give him salutation. \xc2\xa0He hath the throne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotection, he hath the crown\xe2\x80\x99s support, he shall be known and called by\r\nthe honourable title of the King\xe2\x80\x99s Ward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and was\r\nconducted from the presence. \xc2\xa0He did not waste any time, but flew to his\r\nmother, to tell her and Nan and Bet all about it and get them to help\r\nhim enjoy the great news. {1}\r\n\r\nConclusion. Justice and retribution.\r\n\r\nWhen the mysteries were all cleared up, it came out, by confession of\r\nHugh Hendon, that his wife had repudiated Miles by his command, that\r\nday at Hendon Hall--a command assisted and supported by the perfectly\r\ntrustworthy promise that if she did not deny that he was Miles Hendon,\r\nand stand firmly to it, he would have her life; whereupon she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it!\xe2\x80\x9d--she did not value it--and she would not repudiate\r\nMiles; then the husband said he would spare her life but have Miles\r\nassassinated! \xc2\xa0This was a different matter; so she gave her word and\r\nkept it.\r\n\r\nHugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestates and title, because the wife and brother would not testify\r\nagainst him--and the former would not have been allowed to do it, even\r\nif she had wanted to. \xc2\xa0Hugh deserted his wife and went over to the\r\ncontinent, where he presently died; and by-and-by the Earl of Kent\r\nmarried his relict. There were grand times and rejoicings at Hendon\r\nvillage when the couple paid their first visit to the Hall.\r\n\r\nTom Canty\xe2\x80\x99s father was never heard of again.\r\n\r\nThe King sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as a slave,\r\nand reclaimed him from his evil life with the Ruffler\xe2\x80\x99s gang, and put\r\nhim in the way of a comfortable livelihood.\r\n\r\nHe also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his fine. He\r\nprovided good homes for the daughters of the two Baptist women whom he\r\nsaw burned at the stake, and roundly punished the official who laid the\r\nundeserved stripes upon Miles Hendon\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\nHe saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray falcon, and\r\nalso the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a weaver; but he\r\nwas too late to save the man who had been convicted of killing a deer in\r\nthe royal forest.\r\n\r\nHe showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was supposed\r\nto have stolen a pig, and he had the gratification of seeing him grow in\r\nthe public esteem and become a great and honoured man.\r\n\r\nAs long as the King lived he was fond of telling the story of his\r\nadventures, all through, from the hour that the sentinel cuffed him\r\naway from the palace gate till the final midnight when he deftly mixed\r\nhimself into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped into the Abbey\r\nand climbed up and hid himself in the Confessor\xe2\x80\x99s tomb, and then slept\r\nso long, next day, that he came within one of missing the Coronation\r\naltogether. \xc2\xa0He said that the frequent rehearsing of the precious lesson\r\nkept him strong in his purpose to make its teachings yield benefits to\r\nhis people; and so, whilst his life was spared he should continue to\r\ntell the story, and thus keep its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his\r\nmemory and the springs of pity replenished in his heart.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon and Tom Canty were favourites of the King, all through his\r\nbrief reign, and his sincere mourners when he died. The good Earl\r\nof Kent had too much sense to abuse his peculiar privilege; but he\r\nexercised it twice after the instance we have seen of it before he was\r\ncalled from this world--once at the accession of Queen Mary, and once at\r\nthe accession of Queen Elizabeth. \xc2\xa0A descendant of his exercised it\r\nat the accession of James I. \xc2\xa0Before this one\xe2\x80\x99s son chose to use the\r\nprivilege, near a quarter of a century had elapsed, and the \xe2\x80\x98privilege\r\nof the Kents\xe2\x80\x99 had faded out of most people\xe2\x80\x99s memories; so, when the Kent\r\nof that day appeared before Charles I. and his court and sat down in the\r\nsovereign\xe2\x80\x99s presence to assert and perpetuate the right of his house,\r\nthere was a fine stir indeed! \xc2\xa0But the matter was soon explained, and\r\nthe right confirmed. \xc2\xa0The last Earl of the line fell in the wars of the\r\nCommonwealth fighting for the King, and the odd privilege ended with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTom Canty lived to be a very old man, a handsome, white-haired old\r\nfellow, of grave and benignant aspect. \xc2\xa0As long as he lasted he was\r\nhonoured; and he was also reverenced, for his striking and peculiar\r\ncostume kept the people reminded that \xe2\x80\x98in his time he had been royal;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nso, wherever he appeared the crowd fell apart, making way for him, and\r\nwhispering, one to another, \xe2\x80\x9cDoff thy hat, it is the King\xe2\x80\x99s Ward!\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nso they saluted, and got his kindly smile in return--and they valued it,\r\ntoo, for his was an honourable history.\r\n\r\nYes, King Edward VI. lived only a few years, poor boy, but he lived them\r\nworthily. \xc2\xa0More than once, when some great dignitary, some gilded vassal\r\nof the crown, made argument against his leniency, and urged that some\r\nlaw which he was bent upon amending was gentle enough for its purpose,\r\nand wrought no suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind,\r\nthe young King turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate\r\neyes upon him and answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost _thou_ know of suffering and oppression? \xc2\xa0I and my people\r\nknow, but not thou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reign of Edward VI. was a singularly merciful one for those harsh\r\ntimes. \xc2\xa0Now that we are taking leave of him, let us try to keep this in\r\nour minds, to his credit.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES AND TWAIN\xe2\x80\x99S NOTES\r\n\r\n{1} \xc2\xa0For Mark Twain\xe2\x80\x99s note see below under the relevant chapter heading.\r\n\r\n{2} \xc2\xa0He refers to the order of baronets, or baronettes; the barones\r\nminores, as distinct from the parliamentary barons--not, it need hardly\r\nbe said, to the baronets of later creation.\r\n\r\n{3} \xc2\xa0The lords of Kingsale, descendants of De Courcy, still enjoy this\r\ncurious privilege.\r\n\r\n{4} \xc2\xa0Hume.\r\n\r\n{5} \xc2\xa0Ib.\r\n\r\n{6} \xc2\xa0Leigh Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98The Town,\xe2\x80\x99 p.408, quotation from an early tourist.\r\n\r\n{7} \xc2\xa0Canting terms for various kinds of thieves, beggars and vagabonds,\r\nand their female companions.\r\n\r\n{8} \xc2\xa0From \xe2\x80\x98The English Rogue.\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa0London, 1665.\r\n\r\n{9} \xc2\xa0Hume\xe2\x80\x99s England.\r\n\r\n{10} \xc2\xa0See Dr. J.

The Loving-cup.\r\n\r\nThe loving-cup, and the peculiar ceremonies observed in drinking from\r\nit, are older than English history. \xc2\xa0It is thought that both are Danish\r\nimportations. \xc2\xa0As far back as knowledge goes, the loving-cup has always\r\nbeen drunk at English banquets. \xc2\xa0Tradition explains the ceremonies in\r\nthis way. \xc2\xa0In the rude ancient times it was deemed a wise precaution\r\nto have both hands of both drinkers employed, lest while the pledger\r\npledged his love and fidelity to the pledgee, the pledgee take that\r\nopportunity to slip a dirk into him!\r\n\r\nNOTE 7, Chapter XI.

(for Seditious Libeller), and to\r\nremain in prison for life. \xc2\xa0The severity of this sentence was equalled\r\nby the savage rigour of its execution.--Ibid. p. 12.\r\n\r\nNOTES to Chapter XXXIII.\r\n\r\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, or Bluecoat School, \xe2\x80\x99the noblest institution in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe ground on which the Priory of the Grey Friars stood was conferred\r\nby Henry VIII. on the Corporation of London (who caused the institution\r\nthere of a home for poor boys and girls). Subsequently, Edward VI.\r\ncaused the old Priory to be properly repaired, and founded within\r\nit that noble establishment called the Bluecoat School, or Christ\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHospital, for the _education_ and maintenance of orphans and the\r\nchildren of indigent persons . . . Edward would not let him (Bishop\r\nRidley) depart till the letter was written (to the Lord Mayor), and then\r\ncharged him to deliver it himself, and signify his special request and\r\ncommandment that no time might be lost in proposing what was convenient,\r\nand apprising him of the proceedings. \xc2\xa0The work was zealously\r\nundertaken, Ridley himself engaging in it; and the result was the\r\nfounding of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital for the education of poor children. (The\r\nKing endowed several other charities at the same time.) \xe2\x80\x9cLord God,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cI yield Thee most hearty thanks that Thou hast given me life thus\r\nlong to finish this work to the glory of Thy name!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0That innocent and\r\nmost exemplary life was drawing rapidly to its close, and in a few days\r\nhe rendered up his spirit to his Creator, praying God to defend the\r\nrealm from Papistry.--J. Heneage Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s London: \xc2\xa0its Celebrated\r\nCharacters and Places.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Hall hangs a large picture of King Edward VI. seated on his\r\nthrone, in a scarlet and ermined robe, holding the sceptre in his left\r\nhand, and presenting with the other the Charter to the kneeling Lord\r\nMayor. \xc2\xa0By his side stands the Chancellor, holding the seals, and next\r\nto him are other officers of state. \xc2\xa0Bishop Ridley kneels before him\r\nwith uplifted hands, as if supplicating a blessing on the event; whilst\r\nthe Aldermen, etc., with the Lord Mayor, kneel on both sides, occupying\r\nthe middle ground of the picture; and lastly, in front, are a double row\r\nof boys on one side and girls on the other, from the master and matron\r\ndown to the boy and girl who have stepped forward from their respective\r\nrows, and kneel with raised hands before the King.--Timbs\xe2\x80\x99 Curiosities\r\nof London, p. 98.\r\n\r\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, by ancient custom, possesses the privilege of\r\naddressing the Sovereign on the occasion of his or her coming into the\r\nCity to partake of the hospitality of the Corporation of London.--Ibid.\r\n\r\nThe Dining Hall, with its lobby and organ-gallery, occupies the entire\r\nstorey, which is 187 feet long, 51 feet wide, and 47 feet high; it is\r\nlit by nine large windows, filled with stained glass on the south side;\r\nand is, next to Westminster Hall, the noblest room in the metropolis.\r\n\xc2\xa0Here the boys, now about 800 in number, dine; and here are held the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppings in Public,\xe2\x80\x99 to which visitors are admitted by tickets issued\r\nby the Treasurer and by the Governors of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital. \xc2\xa0The tables\r\nare laid with cheese in wooden bowls, beer in wooden piggins, poured\r\nfrom leathern jacks, and bread brought in large baskets. \xc2\xa0The official\r\ncompany enter; the Lord Mayor, or President, takes his seat in a state\r\nchair made of oak from St. Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s Church, by the Tower; a hymn\r\nis sung, accompanied by the organ; a \xe2\x80\x98Grecian,\xe2\x80\x99 or head boy, reads the\r\nprayers from the pulpit, silence being enforced by three drops of a\r\nwooden hammer. \xc2\xa0After prayer the supper commences, and the visitors walk\r\nbetween the tables. \xc2\xa0At its close the \xe2\x80\x99trade-boys\xe2\x80\x99 take up the baskets,\r\nbowls, jacks, piggins, and candlesticks, and pass in procession, the\r\nbowing to the Governors being curiously formal. \xc2\xa0This spectacle was\r\nwitnessed by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1845.\r\n\r\nAmong the more eminent Bluecoat boys are Joshua Barnes, editor\r\nof Anacreon and Euripides; Jeremiah Markland, the eminent critic,\r\nparticularly in Greek Literature; Camden, the antiquary; Bishop\r\nStillingfleet; Samuel Richardson, the novelist; Thomas Mitchell, the\r\ntranslator of Aristophanes; Thomas Barnes, many years editor of the\r\nLondon Times; Coleridge, Charles Lamb, and Leigh Hunt.\r\n\r\nNo boy is admitted before he is seven years old, or after he is nine;\r\nand no boy can remain in the school after he is fifteen, King\xe2\x80\x99s boys and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grecians\xe2\x80\x99 alone excepted. \xc2\xa0There are about 500 Governors, at the head\r\nof whom are the Sovereign and the Prince of Wales. \xc2\xa0The qualification\r\nfor a Governor is payment of 500 pounds.--Ibid.\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTE.\r\n\r\nOne hears much about the \xe2\x80\x98hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,\xe2\x80\x99 and is\r\naccustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned. \xc2\xa0There are people\r\nin America--and even in England!--who imagine that they were a very\r\nmonument of malignity, pitilessness, and inhumanity; whereas in reality\r\nthey were about the first _sweeping departure from judicial atrocity_\r\nwhich the \xe2\x80\x98civilised\xe2\x80\x99 world had seen. \xc2\xa0This humane and kindly Blue Law\r\nCode, of two hundred and forty years ago, stands all by itself,\r\nwith ages of bloody law on the further side of it, and a century and\r\nthree-quarters of bloody English law on _this_ side of it.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a time--under the Blue Laws or any other--when\r\nabove _fourteen_ crimes were punishable by death in Connecticut. \xc2\xa0But in\r\nEngland, within the memory of men who are still hale in body and mind,\r\n_two hundred and twenty-three_ crimes were punishable by death! {10}\r\n\xc2\xa0These facts are worth knowing--and worth thinking about, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince and The Pauper,\r\nComplete by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRINCE AND THE PAUPER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1837-0.txt or 1837-0.zip ***** This and\r\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/3/1837/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\r\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\r\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\r\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\r\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\r\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\r\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\r\nthe IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\r\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\r\nincluding including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\r\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\r\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\r\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\r\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
