VINCENT rose from the uneasy bed, where she had not slept, upon\r\nthat dreadful Sunday morning, with feelings which it would be vain to\r\nattempt any description of. Snatches of momentary sleep more dreadful\r\nthan wakefulness had fallen upon her during the awful night--moments of\r\nunconsciousness which plunged her into a deeper horror still, and from\r\nwhich she started thinking she heard Susan call. Had Susan called, had\r\nSusan come, in any dreadful plight of misery, her mother thought she\r\ncould have borne it; but she could not, yet did, bear this, with the\r\nmingled passion and patience of a woman; one moment rising up against\r\nthe intolerable, the next sitting down dumb and steadfast before that\r\nterrible necessity which could not be resisted. She got up in the dim\r\nwintry morning with all that restless anguish in her heart, and took out\r\nher best black silk dress, and a clean cap to go under her bonnet. She\r\noffered a sacrifice and burnt-offering as she dressed herself in her\r\nsnow-white cuffs, and composed her trim little figure into its Sunday\r\nneatness; for the minister\'s mother must go to chapel this dreadful\r\nday. No whisper of the torture she was enduring must breathe among the\r\nflock--nothing could excuse her from attending Salem, seeing her son\'s\r\npeople, and hearing Mr. Beecher preach, and holding up Arthur\'s standard\r\nat this dangerous crisis of the battle. She felt she was pale when she\r\ncame into the sitting-room, but comforted herself with thinking that\r\nnobody in Salem knew that by nature she had a little tender winter bloom\r\nupon her face, and was not usually so downcast and heavy-eyed.\r\nInstinctively, she rearranged the breakfast-table as she waited for the\r\nyoung minister from Homerton, who was not an early riser. Mr. Beecher\r\nthought it rather cheerful than otherwise when he came in somewhat late\r\nand hurried, and found her waiting by the white covered table, with the\r\nfire bright and the tea made. He was in high spirits, as was natural. He\r\nthought Vincent was in very comfortable quarters, and had uncommonly\r\npleasant rooms.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think so? And one has just as great a chance of being\r\nuncomfortable as not in one\'s first charge," said the young preacher;\r\n"but we were all delighted to hear that Vincent had made an \'it.\r\nLiberal-minded people, I should say, if I may judge by Mr. Tozer, who\r\nwas uncommonly friendly last night. These sort of people are the\r\nstrength of our connection--not great people, you know, but the flower\r\nof the middle classes. I am surprised you did not bring Miss Vincent\r\nwith you for a little cheerful society at this time of the year."\r\n\r\n"My daughter may perhaps come yet, before--before I leave," said Mrs.\r\nVincent, drawing herself up, with a little hauteur, as Mr. Beecher\r\nthought, though in reality it was only a physical expression of that sob\r\nof agony to which she dared not give vent in audible sound.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought it might be more cheerful for her in the winter," said\r\nthe preacher, a little affronted that his interest in Vincent\'s pretty\r\nsister should be received so coldly. He was interrupted by the arrival\r\nof the post, for Carlingford was a profane country town, and had its\r\nletters on Sunday morning. The widow set herself desperately down in an\r\narm-chair to read Arthur\'s letter. It made her heart beat loud with\r\nthrobs so violent that a blindness came over her eyes, and her very life\r\nfailed for an instant. It was very short, very assured and certain--he\r\nwas going to Northumberland, where the fugitives had gone--he was going\r\nto bring Susan back. Mr. Beecher over his egg watched her reading this,\r\nand saw that she grew ashy, deathly pale. It was not possible for him to\r\nkeep silent, or to refrain from wondering what it was.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, I am afraid you are ill--can I get you anything?" he said,\r\nrising from the table.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent folded up her letter. "Thank you; my tea will refresh me,"\r\nshe said, coming back to her seat. "I did not sleep very much last\r\nnight, and my head aches: when people come to my time of life," said the\r\nlittle woman, with a faint heroical smile, "they seldom sleep well the\r\nfirst few nights in a new place. I hope you rested comfortably, Mr.\r\nBeecher. Mr. Vincent, Arthur\'s dear papa, used to say that he never\r\npreached well if he did not sleep well; and I have heard other\r\nministers say it was a very true rule."\r\n\r\n"If that is all, I hope you will be pleased to-day," said the preacher,\r\nwith a little complaisance. "I always sleep well; nothing puts me much\r\nout in that respect. Perhaps it is about time to start now? I like to\r\nhave a few minutes in the vestry before going into the pulpit. You know\r\nthe way perhaps? or we can call at Mr. Tozer\'s and get one of them to\r\nguide us."\r\n\r\n"I think I know the way," said Mrs. Vincent, faintly. It was a slight\r\ncomfort, in the midst of her martyrdom, to leave the room and have a\r\nmoment to herself. She sank down by her bedside in an inarticulate agony\r\nof prayer, which doubtless God deciphered, though it never came to\r\nwords, and rose up again to put on her bonnet, her neat shawl, her best\r\npair of gloves. The smile that might have come on the face of a martyr\r\nat the stake dawned upon the little woman\'s lips as she caught sight of\r\nher own pale face in the glass, when she was tying her bonnet-strings.\r\nShe was not thrusting her hand into the scorching flames, she was only\r\npulling out the bows of black ribbon, and giving the last touch to that\r\nperfection of gentle neatness in which Arthur\'s mother, for his sake,\r\nmust present herself to his people. She took Mr. Beecher\'s arm\r\nafterwards, and walked with him, through the wintry sunshine and streams\r\nof churchgoers, to Salem. Perhaps she was just a little sententious in\r\nher talk to the young preacher, who would have stared had anybody told\r\nhim what active and feverish wretchedness was in her heart. She quoted\r\nArthur\'s dear father more than usual; she felt a little irritated in\r\nspite of herself by the complaisance of the young man from \'Omerton.\r\nNotwithstanding the dreadful pressure of her trouble, she felt that his\r\nexcitement in the prospect of preaching to Arthur\'s people was quite\r\nill-timed. What did it matter to him whether the Salem flock liked him\r\nor not? Were they not Arthur\'s people, pre-engaged to their own pastor?\r\nThe gentle widow did what she could to bring Mr. Beecher down as they\r\nwalked through Grove Street. She remarked, gently, that where a minister\r\nwas very popular, a stranger had but little chance of appreciation. "You\r\nmust not be mortified if you see the congregation look disappointed when\r\nyou come into the pulpit," said Mrs. Vincent; "for my son, if he had not\r\nbeen called away so suddenly, was to commence a course of lectures\r\nto-day, and I believe a good deal of expectation was raised about them."\r\nThe new preacher was perhaps a shade less buoyant when he resigned his\r\nfriend\'s mother to Tozer at the door of the chapel, to be conducted to\r\nher pew. Salem was already about half filled; and the entering flock\r\nlooked at Mrs. Vincent, as she stood with the deacon in the porch,\r\nasking, with the courtesy of a royal personage, humble yet affable,\r\nafter his wife and daughter. Tozer was a little overawed by the\r\npoliteness of the minister\'s mother. He concluded that she was "quite\r\nthe lady" in his private heart.\r\n\r\n"If you tell me where the minister\'s seat is, I need not trouble you to\r\ngo in," said Mrs. Vincent.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Tufton\'s uncommon punctual, and it\'s close upon her time," said\r\nTozer; "being a single man, we\'ve not set apart a seat for the\r\nminister--not till he\'s got some one as can sit in it; it\'s the old\r\nminister\'s seat, as is the only one we\'ve set aside; for we\'ve been\r\na-letting of the pews uncommon this past month, and it don\'t answer to\r\nwaste nothing in a chapel as is as expensive to keep up as Salem. It\'s\r\nour pride to give our minister a good salary, as you know, ma\'am, and\r\nwe\'ve all got to pay up according, so there ain\'t no pew set apart for\r\nMr. Vincent--not till he\'s got a wife."\r\n\r\n"Then I am to sit in Mr. Tufton\'s pew?" said the minister\'s mother, not\r\nwithout a little sharpness.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no more of them never at Salem, but Mrs. Tufton," said\r\nTozer. "Mr. Tufton has had a shock, and the only one of a family they\'ve\r\nat home is a great invalid, and never was within the chapel door in my\r\ntime. Mr. Tufton he do come now and again. He would have been here\r\nto-day, I make bold to say, but for the minister being called away. I\r\nhope you\'ve \'eard from Mr. Vincent, ma\'am, and as he\'ll soon be back. It\r\nain\'t a good thing for a congregation when the pastor takes to going off\r\nsudden. Here she is a-coming. Mrs. Tufton, ma\'am, this is Mrs. Vincent,\r\nthe minister\'s mother; she\'s been waiting for you to go into your pew."\r\n\r\n"I hope I shall not be in your way," said Mrs. Vincent, with her\r\ndignified air. "I have always been accustomed to see a seat for the\r\nminister, but as I am a stranger, I hope for once I shall not be in your\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say a word!" cried Mrs. Tufton. "I am as glad as possible to see\r\nMr. Vincent\'s mother. He is a precious young man. It\'s not a right\r\nprinciple, you know, but it\'s hard not to envy people that are so happy\r\nin their families; nothing would make my Tom take to the ministry,\r\nthough his papa and I had set our hearts upon it; and he\'s in Australia,\r\npoor dear fellow! and my poor girl is such an invalid. I hope your\r\ndaughter is pretty well? Come this way. I hope I shall see a great deal\r\nof you. Mr. Tufton takes such an interest in his young brother; all that\r\nhe wants is a little good advice--that is what the minister always tells\r\nme. All that Mr. Vincent wants, he says, is a little good advice."\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this was communicated in a whisper, as the two ladies\r\nseated themselves in the minister\'s pew. After a momentary pause of\r\nprivate devotion, Mrs. Tufton again took up the strain where she had\r\nleft it off.\r\n\r\n"I assure you, we take the greatest interest in him at the cottage. He\r\ndoesn\'t come to see us so often as Mr. Tufton would wish, but I daresay\r\nhe has other things to do. The minister often says to me that he is a\r\nprecious young man, is Mr. Vincent, and that a little good advice and\r\nattention to those that know better is all he wants to make him a\r\nshining light; and I am sure he will want no good advice Mr. Tufton can\r\ngive him. So you may keep your mind easy--you may keep your mind quite\r\neasy. In any difficulty that could occur, I am sure the minister would\r\nact as if he were his own son."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind; but I hope no difficulty will occur," said Mrs.\r\nVincent, with a little quiver in her lip.\r\n\r\n"I hope not, indeed; but there are so many people to please in a flock,"\r\nsaid the late minister\'s wife, with a sigh. "We always got on very well,\r\nfor Mr. Tufton is not one to take a deal of notice of any\r\nunpleasantness; but you know as well as I do that it takes a deal of\r\nattention to keep all matters straight. If you\'ll excuse me, it\'s a\r\ngreat pity Mr. Vincent has gone away to-day. Nothing would have made my\r\nhusband leave his post just as he was intimated to begin a course of\r\nlectures. It\'s very excusable in Mr. Vincent, because he hasn\'t that\r\nexperience that\'s necessary. I always say he\'s very excusable, being\r\nsuch a young man; and we have no doubt he\'ll get on very well if he does\r\nbut take advice."\r\n\r\n"My son was very unwilling to go; but it was quite necessary. His\r\nsister," said Mrs. Vincent, clasping her hands tight under her shawl to\r\nbalance the pang in her heart, "was with some friends--whom we heard\r\nsomething unpleasant about--and he went to bring her home. I expect\r\nthem--to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThe poor mother shut her lips close when she had said the words, to keep\r\nin the cry or sob that seemed bursting from them. Yes, God help her, she\r\nexpected them; perhaps to-morrow--perhaps that same dreadful night; but\r\neven in the height of her anguish there occurred to Mrs. Vincent a\r\nforlorn prayer that they might not come back that Sunday. Rather another\r\nagonising night than that all the "Chapel folks" should be aware that\r\ntheir pastor was rushing wildly along distant railways on the day of\r\nrest. The fact that he was doing so added a pang to her own trouble.\r\nTotal disarrangement, chaos, all the old habitudes of life gone to\r\nwreck, and only desperation and misery left, was the sensation produced\r\nby that interruption of all religious use and wont. It came upon her\r\nwith an acute sting, to think that her poor young minister was\r\ntravelling that Sunday; just as in Arthur\'s own experience at that same\r\nmoment, the utter incoherence, chaos, and wretchedness into which his\r\nlife had suddenly fallen, breathed upon him in the sound of the\r\nchurch-bells.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, I am very sorry!" said Mrs. Tufton; "some fever or something,\r\nI suppose--something that\'s catching? Dear, dear me, I am so sorry! but\r\nthere are some people that never take infection; a little camphor is\r\nsuch a nice thing to carry about--it can\'t do any harm, you know. Mrs.\r\nTozer tells me he is a very nice young man, Mr. Vincent\'s friend from\r\n\'Omerton. I don\'t like to say such a thing of a girl, but I do believe\r\nyour son could have that Phoebe any day for asking, Mrs. Vincent. I\r\ncan\'t bear forward girls, for my part--that is her just going into the\r\npew, with the pink bonnet; oh, you know her!--to be sure, Mrs. Pigeon\r\nremarked you were sure to go there; though I should have hoped we would\r\nhave seen you as soon as any one in Carlingford."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I have been much disappointed not to call. I--I hope I\r\nshall--tomorrow," said the widow, to whom tomorrow loomed dark like\r\nanother world, and who could not help repeating over and over the\r\ndreaded name.\r\n\r\n"That is Maria Pigeon all in white--to be only tradespeople they do\r\ndress more than I approve of," said Mrs. Tufton. "My Adelaide, I am\r\nsure, never went like that. Many people think Maria a deal nicer-looking\r\nthan Phoebe Tozer, but her mother is so particular--more than\r\nparticular--what I call troublesome, you know. You can\'t turn round\r\nwithout giving her offence. Dear me, how my tongue is going! the\r\nminister would say I was just at my old imprudent tricks--but you, that\r\nwere a minister\'s wife, can understand. She is such a difficult woman to\r\ndeal with. I am sure Mr. Tufton is always telling them to wait, and that\r\nMr. Vincent is a young man yet, and experience is all he wants. I wish\r\nhe had a good wife to keep him straight; but I don\'t know that that\r\nwould be advisable either, because of Phoebe and the rest. Dear, dear,\r\nit is a difficult thing to know what to do!--but Mr. Tufton always says,\r\nIf he had a little more experience---- Bless me, the young man is in the\r\npulpit!" said Mrs. Tufton, coming to a sudden standstill, growing very\r\nred, and picking up her hymn-book. Very seldom had the good woman such a\r\nchance of talk. She ran herself so out of breath that she could not join\r\nin that first hymn.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Vincent, who had a sensation that the pew, and indeed the whole\r\nchapel, trembled with the trembling that was in her own frame, but who\r\nfelt at the same time that everybody was looking at her, and that\r\nArthur\'s credit was involved, stood up steadfastly, holding her book\r\nfirm in both her hands, and with an effort almost too much for her, the\r\nheroism of a martyr, added her soft voice, touched with age, yet still\r\nmelodious and true, to the song of praise. The words choked her as she\r\nuttered them, yet with a kind of desperate courage she kept on.\r\nPraise!--it happened to be a very effusive hymn that day, an utterance\r\nof unmitigated thanksgiving; fortunately she had not sufficient command\r\nof her mind or wits to see clearly what she was singing, or to enter\r\ninto the wonderful bitter difference between the thanks she was uttering\r\nand the position in which she stood. Could she give God thanks for\r\nSusan\'s ruin, or rejoice in the light He had given, when it revealed\r\nonly misery? She was not called upon to answer that hard question. She\r\nstood up mechanically with her white face set in pale steadfastness, and\r\nwas only aware that she was singing, keeping the tune, and making\r\nherself noways remarked among the crowd of strange people, many of whom\r\nturned curious eyes towards her. She stood with both her feet set firm\r\non the floor, both her hands holding fast to the book, and over the ache\r\nof frightful suspense in her heart came the soft voice of her singing,\r\nwhich for once in her life meant nothing except a forlorn determination\r\nto keep up and hold herself erect and vigilant, sentinel over Arthur\'s\r\nfortunes and his people\'s thoughts.\r\n\r\nMr. Beecher\'s sermon was undeniably clever; the Salem folks pricked up\r\ntheir ears at the sound of it, recalling as it did that period of\r\ndelightful excitation when they were hearing candidates, and felt\r\nthemselves the dispensers of patronage. That was over now, and they\r\nwere wedded to one; but the bond of union between themselves and their\r\npastor was far from being indissoluble, and they contemplated this new\r\naspirant to their favour with feelings stimulated and piquant, as a not\r\ninconsolable husband, likely to become a widower, might contemplate the\r\ngeneral female public, out of which candidates for the problematically\r\nvacant place might arise. Mrs. Pigeon, who was the leader of the\r\nopposition, and whose daughter Mr. Vincent had not distinguished, whose\r\nhouse he had not specially frequented, and whom, most of all, he had\r\npassed in the street without recognition, made a note of this man from\r\n\'Omerton. If the painful necessity of dismissing the present pastor\r\nshould occur--as such things did occur, deplorable though they were--it\r\nmight be worth while sending for Mr. Beecher. She made a note of him\r\nprivately in her mind, as she sat listening with ostentatious attention,\r\nnodding her head now and then by way of assent to his statements. Mrs.\r\nVincent remarked her as she watched the congregation from the minister\'s\r\npew, with her jealous mother\'s eyes. The Tozers were not so devoted in\r\ntheir listening. Mrs. Tozer\'s brilliant cherry-coloured bonnet visibly\r\ndrooped once or twice with a blessed irregularity of motion; all these\r\nsigns Mrs. Vincent perceived as she sat in preternatural acute\r\nconsciousness of everything round her, by Mrs. Tufton\'s side. She was\r\neven aware that the sermon was clever; she remembered expressions in it\r\nlong after, which somehow got burned in, without any will of hers, upon\r\nher breaking heart. The subdued anguish that was in her collected fuel\r\nfor its own silent consuming fire, even in the congregation of Salem,\r\nwhere, very upright, very watchful, afraid to relax her strained nerves\r\neven by leaning back or forward, she lived through the long service as\r\nif through a year of suffering.\r\n\r\nThe congregation dispersed in a buzz of talk and curiosity. Everybody\r\nwanted to know where the minister had gone, and what had taken him away.\r\n"I can\'t say as I think he\'s using of us well," said somebody, whom Mrs.\r\nVincent could hear as she made her way to the door. "Business of his\r\nown! a minister ain\'t got no right to have business of his own,\r\nleastways on Sundays. Preaching\'s his business. I don\'t hold with that\r\nnotion. He\'s in our employ, and we pays him well----"\r\n\r\nHere a whisper from some charitable bystander directed the speaker\'s\r\neyes to Mrs. Vincent, who was close behind.\r\n\r\n"Well! it ain\'t nothing to me who hears me," said this rebellious\r\nmember, not without a certain vulgar pleasure in his power of insult.\r\n"We pays him well, as I say; I have to stick to my business well or ill,\r\nand I don\'t see no reason why the minister should be different. If he\r\ndon\'t mind us as pays him, why, another will."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve been waiting to catch your eye," said Mrs. Pigeon, darting\r\nforward at this crisis to Mrs. Tufton; "wasn\'t that a sweet sermon?\r\nthat\'s refreshing, that is! I haven\'t listened to anything as has roused\r\nme up like that--no, not since dear Mr. Tufton came first to\r\nCarlingford; as for what we\'ve been hearing of late, I don\'t say it\'s\r\nnot clever, but, oh, it\'s cold! and for them as like good gospel\r\npreaching and rousing up, I must confess as Mr. Vincent----"\r\n\r\n"Hush! Mrs. Pigeon--Mrs. Vincent," said Mrs. Tufton, hurriedly; "you two\r\nladies should have been introduced at the first. Mr. Pigeon is one of\r\nour deacons and leading men, Mrs. Vincent, and I don\'t doubt you\'ve\r\noften and often heard your son talking of him. We are always discussing\r\nMr. Vincent, because he is our own pastor now, you know; and a precious\r\nyoung man he is--and all that he wants is a little experience, as Mr.\r\nTufton always says."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am sorry!-- I beg your pardon, I\'m sure," cried Mrs. Pigeon; "but\r\nI am one as always speaks my mind, and don\'t go back of my word. Folks\r\nas sees a deal of the minister," continued the poulterer\'s wife, not\r\nwithout a glance at that cherry-coloured bonnet which had nodded during\r\nthe sermon, and to which poor Mrs. Vincent felt a certain gratitude,\r\n"may know different; but me as don\'t have much chance, except in chapel,\r\nI will say as I think he wants speaking to: most folks do--specially\r\nyoung folks, when they\'re making a start in the world. He\'s too high, he\r\nis, for us plain Salem folks; what we want is a man as preaches gospel\r\nsermons--real rousing-up discourses--and sits down pleasant to his tea,\r\nand makes hisself friendly. I never was one as thought a minister\r\ncouldn\'t do wrong. I always said as they were just like other men,\r\nliking grand dinners and grand folks, and the vanities of this\r\nworld; not meaning no offence, Mrs. Vincent, neither to you nor the\r\nminister--but I must say as I think, he\'s a deal too high."\r\n\r\n"My son has had very good training," said the widow, not without\r\ndignity. "His dear father had many good friends who have taken an\r\ninterest in him. He has always been accustomed to good society, and I\r\nmust say, at the same time," added Mrs. Vincent, "that I never knew\r\nArthur to fail in courtesy to the poorer brethren. If he has done so, I\r\nam sure it has been unintentionally. It is quite against my principles\r\nand his dear father\'s to show any respect to persons. If he has shown\r\nany neglect of Mrs. Pigeon\'s family," continued the mild diplomatist,\r\n"it must have been because he thought them less, and not more in need of\r\nhim than the rest of the flock."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pigeon listened with open mouth, but total discomfiture: whether\r\nthis was a compliment or a reprimand was totally beyond her power to\r\nmake out. She cried, "Oh, I\'m sure!" in a tone which was half defensive\r\nand half deprecating. Mrs. Pigeon, however, intended nothing less than\r\nto terminate the conversation at this interesting point, and it was with\r\nutter dismay that she perceived Mrs. Vincent sweep past before she had\r\nrecovered herself--sweep past--though that black silk gown was of very\r\nmoderate dimensions, and the trim little figure was noways majestic. The\r\nminister\'s mother made a curtsy to the astonished wife of the poulterer;\r\nshe said "good morning" with a gracious bow, and went upon her way\r\nbefore Mrs. Pigeon had recovered her breath. Perfect victory attended\r\nthe gentle widow in this little passage of arms. Her assailant fell\r\nback, repeating in a subdued tone, "Well, I\'m sure!" Mrs. Pigeon, like\r\nTozer, granted that the minister\'s mother was "quite the lady,"\r\nhenceforward, in her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Vincent passed on victorious; yes, victorious, and conscious of\r\nher victory, though giddy with secret anguish, and feeling as if every\r\nobstacle that hindered her return was a conscious cruelty. They could\r\nnot have arrived this morning--it was impossible; yet she burned to get\r\nback to see whether impossibility might not be accomplished for once,\r\nand Susan be there awaiting her. The first to detain her was Mrs.\r\nTufton, who hurried, with added respect, after her, triumphing secretly\r\nin Mrs. Pigeon\'s defeat.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you gave her her answer," said Mrs. Tufton; "bless me! how\r\npleased Adelaide will be when I tell her! I always said it would be well\r\nfor a minister\'s wife to have a spirit. Won\'t you come and take a bit of\r\ndinner with us, as Mr. Vincent is not at home? Oh, I daresay somebody\r\nwill ask Mr. Beecher. It does not do to pay too much attention to the\r\nyoung men that come to preach--though I think he was clever. You won\'t\r\ncome?--a headache?--poor dear! You\'re worrying about your daughter, I am\r\nsure; but I wouldn\'t, if I were you. Young girls in health don\'t take\r\ninfection. She\'ll come back all right, you\'ll see. Well--good-bye. Don\'t\r\ncome in the evening if you have a headache. I shouldn\'t, if I were you.\r\nGood-bye--and to-morrow, if all is well, we\'ll look for you. Siloam\r\nCottage--just a little way past Salem--you can\'t miss the way."\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you--to-morrow," said Mrs. Vincent. If only anybody could\r\nhave known what dreadful work it was keeping up that smile, holding\r\nupright as she did! Then she went on a little way in peace, half-crazed\r\nwith the misery that consumed her, yet unnaturally vigilant and on the\r\nalert, always holding up Arthur\'s standard at that critical hour when he\r\nhad no representative but herself in his field of battle. But the poor\r\nmother was not long allowed this interval of peace. After a few minutes,\r\nthe Tozers, who were going the same way, came up to her, and surrounded\r\nher like a bodyguard.\r\n\r\n"I liked that sermon, ma\'am," said Tozer; "there was a deal that was\r\npractical in that sermon. If ever we should be in the way of hearing\r\ncandidates again--and shortsighted creatures like us never knows what\'s\r\na-going to happen--I\'d put down that young man\'s name for an \'earing.\r\nThere ain\'t a word to be said again\' the minister\'s sermons in the\r\nmatter of talent. They\'re full of mind, ma\'am--they\'re philosophical,\r\nthat\'s what they are; and the pews we\'ve let in Salem since he come,\r\nproves it, let folks say what they will. But if there is a want, it\'s in\r\nthe application. He don\'t press it home upon their consciences, not as\r\nsome on us expected; and Mr. Tufton being all in that line, as you may\r\nsay, makes it show the more. If I was going to make a change again--not\r\nas I mean nothing of the kind, nor as the Salem folks has ever took it\r\ninto their heads-- I\'d like to have a little o\' both ways, that\'s what\r\nI\'d like."\r\n\r\n"When you get a minister of independent-mind, Mr. Tozer, if he gives you\r\nthe best he has, he ought to be allowed to choose his own way," said\r\nMrs. Vincent. "My dear husband always said so, and he had great\r\nexperience. Mr. Vincent\'s son, I know, will never want friends."\r\n\r\n"I am sure as long as the minister keeps to his duty, he\'ll always find\r\nfriends in Tozer and me," said the deacon\'s wife, striking in; "and\r\nthough there may be folks in a finer way, there ain\'t no such good\r\nfriends a pastor can have as in his own flock. As for hearing candidates\r\nand that, Tozer ought to know as none on us would hear of such a thing.\r\nI don\'t see no reason why Mr. Vincent shouldn\'t settle down in\r\nCarlingford and make himself comfortable. We\'re all his friends as long\r\nas he\'s at his post."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma, I am sure he is at his post," cried Phoebe; "he has gone away\r\nbecause he could not help it. I am quite sure," continued the modest\r\nmaiden, casting down her eyes, "that he would never have left but for a\r\ngood reason! Oh, I am confident he is fond of Carlingford now. He would\r\nnot go away if he had not some duty-- I am certain he would not!"\r\n\r\n"If Phoebe is better informed than the rest of us, it ain\'t nobody\'s\r\nbusiness as I can see," said the father, with a short laugh. "I always\r\nlike the young folks to manage them matters among themselves; but I take\r\nmy own view, miss, for all that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pa, how can you talk so," cried Phoebe, in virgin confusion, "to\r\nmake Mrs. Vincent think----"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, nothing will make me think otherwise than I know," said Mrs.\r\nVincent, with a voice which extinguished Phoebe. "I understand my son.\r\nHe does not bestow his confidence very easily; and I am sure he is quite\r\nable to manage all the matters he may have in hand," added the widow,\r\nnot without significance. Not all her anxiety for Arthur, not all her\r\npersonal wretchedness, could unwoman the minister\'s mother so much as to\r\nmake her forgive or overlook Phoebe\'s presumption. She could not have\r\nlet this pretendant to her son\'s affections off without transfixing her\r\nwith a passing arrow. Human endurance has its limits. Mrs. Vincent could\r\nbear anything for Arthur except this pretence of a special interest in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am sure I never meant----!" faltered Phoebe; but she could get\r\nno further, and even her mother did not come to the rescue.\r\n\r\n"Them things had much best not be talked of," said Mrs. Tozer, sharply.\r\n"Mr. Beecher is coming in to have a bit of dinner. You mightn\'t have\r\nthings comfortable where you are, the minister being away, and you used\r\nto your own house. Won\'t you come in with us and eat a bit of dinner? I\r\nnever can swallow a morsel when I\'m by myself. It\'s lonesome for you in\r\nthem rooms, and us so near. There ain\'t no ceremony nor nonsense, but\r\nwe\'ll be pleased if you\'ll come."\r\n\r\n"Thank you very much," said Mrs. Vincent, who could not forget that the\r\ncherry-coloured bonnet had nodded during Mr. Beecher\'s sermon, "but I\r\nslept badly last night. At my time of life a new bed often makes one\r\nsleepless, and I have a bad headache. I think I will go and lie down.\r\nMany thanks. It is very kind of you to ask me. I hope I shall see you,"\r\nsaid the widow, with a slight shiver, repeating her formula,\r\n"to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t take us amiss," said Mrs. Tozer; "there\'s always enough for\r\nan extra one, if it isn\'t grand or any ceremony; or if you\'ll come to\r\ntea and go to church with us at night? Phoebe can run over and see how\r\nyou find yourself. Good mornin\'. I\'m sorry you\'ll not come in."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wish you would let me go with you and nurse you," said Phoebe,\r\nnot without a glance in the other direction at the approaching form of\r\nthe young man from \'Omerton, "I am so frightened you don\'t like me!--but\r\nI\'ll come over before tea, and sit with you if your headache is not\r\nbetter. If I could only make you fancy I was Miss Vincent!" said\r\nPhoebe, with pink pleading looks.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent turned away more smartly under the effect of that\r\nstimulant. She crossed George Street, towards her son\'s rooms, a\r\nsolitary little figure, in the flood of winter sunshine--not dismal to\r\nlook at, save for its black dress, trim, alert, upright still. And the\r\nheart within, which ached with positive throbs of pain, had roused up\r\nunder that last provocation, and was stinging with indignation and\r\nanger, pure womanly, and not to be deadened by any anguish. Phoebe\'s\r\nimpertinence, as she called it to herself, took her out of her own far\r\nheavier trouble. To think of that pink creature having designs upon her\r\nboy, and taking upon herself little airs of conquest! To encounter\r\nPhoebe\'s wiles overwhelmed Arthur with shame and annoyance; but they\r\nexasperated his mother. She went home with a steadier ring in her little\r\nlight footstep. But the fumes of that temporary excitement had faded\r\nwhen the door opened upon her--the blank door, with the little maid\r\nopen-mouthed behind, who did not look her in the face, and who had\r\nnothing to communicate: the sitting-room up-stairs lay blank in utter\r\nsolitude--all the books put away according to Sunday custom, and the\r\ncover of Arthur\'s letter lying on the table startling his mother into\r\nwild hopes that some other communication had come for her. She sank down\r\nupon a chair, and covered her pale face with her hands--torture\r\nintolerable, unendurable; but oh, how certainly to be endured and put up\r\nwith! This poor mother, who had met with many a heavy sorrow in her day,\r\nthough never any so hideous as this, was no excitable, passionate\r\ncreature, but a wholesome, daylight woman, in whom no strain of\r\nsuperlative emotions had choked up the natural channels of relief. She\r\nwept a few bitter, heavy tears under cover of her clasped hands--tears\r\nwhich took away the dreadful pressure upon her brain, and made it easier\r\nto bear for the moment. Then she went away in her patience, and took off\r\nher bonnet, and prepared herself for the calm of the dreadful day of\r\nwhich so small a portion had yet passed. She pretended to dine, that no\r\noutlet might be left to gossip on that score. She took a good book and\r\nlay down upon the sofa in the awful silence--the moments creeping,\r\nstealing over her in a tedious procession which she could almost\r\nsee--the silence throbbing all around as if with the beats of her own\r\nheart; how was it that the walls of the house stood steady with those\r\nthrobs palpitating within their dull enclosure? But there was this\r\ncomfort at least, that nobody fathomed Mrs. Vincent in that speechless\r\nmartyrdom of hers--nobody guessed the horror in her heart--nobody\r\nimagined that there was anything of tragic meaning under that composed\r\naspect. She went to church again in the evening to escape Phoebe\'s\r\n"nursing," and sat there choking with the anticipation that meantime her\r\nson was bringing Susan home. She walked home with Beecher, devoured by\r\nfeverish hopes and fears, found still no one there, with an unutterable\r\npang, yet relief, and sat with the young man from \'Omerton for a\r\nhorrible hour or two, till the strain had all but killed her. But nobody\r\ncame; nobody came all through the hideous night. Holding with\r\nhalf-frantic hands to the thread of life, which could ill bear this\r\ntotal want of all its usual sustenance, but which must not be sacrificed\r\nfor her children\'s sake--keeping alive, she could not tell how, without\r\nfood, without rest, without even prayer--nothing but a fever of dumb\r\nentreaty coming to her mind when she sought some forlorn comfort from\r\nthe mere fact of going on her knees-- Mrs. Vincent lived through the\r\nnight and the morning. Another horrible, sunshiny, cheerful day; but no\r\nsound in earth or heaven to say they were coming--no arrival, no\r\nletter--nothing but hopeless, sickening, intolerable suspense--suspense\r\nall the more intolerable because it had to be borne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO-MORROW! to-morrow was Monday morning, a new day, a new\r\nwork-week--cheerful, healthful, and exhilarating--bright with that\r\nfrosty sunshine, which carried comparative comfort to many a poor house\r\nin Carlingford. The widow\'s face was sharper, paler, of a wonderful ashy\r\ncolour. Nature could not go on under such a struggle without showing\r\nsigns of it. Beecher, who was not to go until a late train, took leave\r\nof her as soon as he could, not without a little fright, and betook\r\nhimself to Tozer\'s, where he said she overawed him with her grand\r\nmanners, and where he was led to admit that Vincent had always been a\r\nlittle "high." If she could have abandoned herself to her dreadful\r\nvigil, perhaps Mrs. Vincent might have found it easier, perhaps\r\nharder--she herself thought the former; but she dared not give up to it.\r\nShe had to set her face like a flint--she was Arthur\'s representative,\r\nand had still to show a steadfast front of battle for him, and if not\r\ndiscomfit, still confront his enemies. She had to call at Siloam\r\nCottage, at Mrs. Tozer\'s, to do what else might be necessary for the\r\npropitiation of the flock. She never dreamed of saying to herself that\r\nshe could not do it; there was no question of that; the flag had to be\r\nkept flying for Arthur. No friend of his must be jeopardised, no\r\nwhisper allowed to rise which his mother could prevent: she had been a\r\nminister\'s wife for thirty years; well had she learned in that time,\r\nlike Mrs. Tufton, that a deal of attention was needed to keep all things\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in the height of her excitement and anxiety, believing that\r\nany moment the poor fugitive might be brought home, the widow, in her\r\nunflinching martyrdom, once more put on her bonnet, and drew out her\r\nblack ribbon into bows of matchless neatness. Though she wrung her poor\r\nhands in speechless anguish as she went out of the room, it was with\r\ncomposed, though colourless lips, that she spoke to the little maid in\r\nthe hall. "Mr. Vincent may come home any time to-day," said the widow;\r\n"you must have some lunch ready, and tea; perhaps his sister may be with\r\nhim--or--or she may come alone. Any one who comes is to be taken\r\nup-stairs. I will not be long gone; and I am going to Mrs. Tufton\'s, if\r\nanybody should want me----"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a knock came to the door--a hurried single knock, always\r\nalarming, and sounding like an evil omen. Mrs. Vincent\'s voice failed\r\nher at that sound--most likely her face went into convulsive twitches,\r\nfor the maid stood staring at her, too much startled to open the door,\r\nuntil a wild gesture from the speechless woman, who was herself unable\r\nto move, her breath almost forsaking her, and coming in sobs, recalled\r\nthe girl to her senses. The door was opened, and Mrs. Vincent stood with\r\nburning eyes gazing out. Ah, not Susan! never Susan!--a little, stout,\r\nrustic figure, all weary and dishevelled, looking ashamed, frightened,\r\nalmost disreputable in utter forlornness and unhappiness. Mrs. Vincent\r\ngave a great sob to get breath, and dropped upon the chair, and held out\r\nher hand to Mary. She had forgotten Mary--forgotten her momentary\r\ncomfort in the fact that Susan\'s flight was not alone. Now was it life\r\nor death the girl was bringing? She drew the frightened creature near,\r\nclose, and shrieked, as she thought, her question in her ear. "What?\r\nwhat?" said Mrs. Vincent in her own mind; but no sound came to Mary\'s\r\nears.\r\n\r\n"O missis dear, missis dear!" sobbed the girl. "I\'ve been and told Mr.\r\nArthur exact where she is--he\'s gone to fetch her home. O missis, don\'t\r\ntake on! they\'ll soon be here. Miss Susan\'s living, she ain\'t dead. O\r\nmissis, missis, she ain\'t dead--it might be worse nor it is."\r\n\r\nAt these words Mrs. Vincent roused herself up once more. "My daughter\r\nhas been ill," she said in gasps, turning a dreadful look upon the\r\nservant of the house. Then she rose, took hold of Mary\'s arm, and went\r\nup-stairs with her, holding her fast. She shut the door with her own\r\nhands when they got back to the lonely parlour full of daylight and\r\nsilence. "Miss Susan has been ill?" she said once more with parched\r\nlips, looking again, with that full blank gaze which seemed to deny and\r\ndefy any other answer, in Mary\'s frightened face.\r\n\r\n"O missis, don\'t take on!" sobbed the terrified girl.\r\n\r\n"No, oh no, no, that is impossible. I can\'t take on, Mary, if I\r\nwould--oh no, not now," said the poor widow, with what seemed a\r\nmomentary wandering of her strained senses. "Tell me all-- I am ready to\r\nhear it all."\r\n\r\nAnd then Mary began the pitiful story, the same they had heard in\r\nLonsdale--the sudden arrival of the girl and her governess, and innocent\r\nSusan\'s puzzled interest in them; Mr. Fordham\'s appearance afterwards,\r\nhis sudden snatch at the stranger, his ready use of Arthur\'s letter,\r\nwhich Susan was disturbed about, to persuade her that she must instantly\r\ngo to her mother and set all right; the journey bringing them late at\r\nnight to an unknown place, which, with the boom of the unexpected sea in\r\ntheir ears, the defenceless deceived creatures found out not to be\r\nCarlingford. Mary knew nothing of the scene which had been enacted\r\nup-stairs, when the villanous scheme was made known to the unhappy\r\nvictim. She could tell nothing but by guesses of what had passed and\r\nfollowed, and Mary, of course, by a natural certainty, guessed the\r\nworst. But next day Susan had written to her mother, either because she\r\nwas still deceived or still innocent; and the next day again Mary was\r\nsent away under a pretence of being sent to church, and the false\r\nFordham himself had conducted her to town and left her there. Such was\r\nMary\'s tale. Last night she had met Mr. Arthur and given him the\r\naddress. Now, no doubt, they were on their way,--if only missis would\r\nnot take on! "No," said the widow once more, with speechless lips. Take\r\non! oh no, never more. Surely all these light afflictions that could\r\nbring tears were over now--nothing but horror and agony remained. The\r\npoor mother sat for a little in a dreadful silence, aching all over her\r\nanguished frame. Nothing was to be said or done; the pause of utter\r\nmisery, in which thought itself had no place, but one horrible sensation\r\nof suffering was all that remained of life, passed over her; then a\r\nfaint agonised smile fluttered upon her white lips. She drew on her\r\nglove again slowly and with pain. "I must go out, Mary," said Arthur\'s\r\nmother. "I must do my duty if the world were all breaking up, as I--I\r\nthink it is; and you must stay here and tell my poor darling her mother\r\nwill come back to her directly. And don\'t talk to the other servant,\r\nMary. You shall be like my own child if you will stand by us now."\r\n\r\n"O missis dear, not a word--not if it was to save my life!" said poor\r\nMary, through her tears.\r\n\r\nAnd in her bravery and desperation the widow went out to her other\r\nforlorn hope. She went away out of the doors which enclosed at least the\r\nknowledge of this event, through the everyday streets, where, if there\r\nwere other tragedies, nobody knew of them any more than of hers. She had\r\nher veil over her face, on which that shadow had settled, and no one\r\ncould have suspected her of carrying a broken heart through those\r\nsunshiny ways. She could not think or anticipate or even fear anything\r\nfurther. Susan might die under that load of shame and anguish, but her\r\nmother apprehended, was sensible of, nothing more. The worst had come,\r\nexcept for Arthur, who might be helped out of his troubles. So, stunned\r\nand hopeless, she set out to visit Arthur\'s people, with a courage more\r\ndesperate than that of battle. That was the duty which must be done if\r\nthe world went to pieces--to talk to Adelaide Tufton and hear her sharp\r\ncriticism and bitter gossip--to listen to the old minister dawdling\r\nforth his slow sentiments--to visit the Tozers and soothe their\r\nfeelings, and hear what they had to say. An auto-da-f\xe9 in the old\r\nSpanish fashion would have been easier, to be sure; but this was how the\r\nminister\'s mother, in the depths of unknown anguish and calamity, was\r\nexpected to exert herself, the only way she could serve her son.\r\n\r\nThe parlour in Siloam Cottage was as green and obscure, as warm and\r\nclose, as of old. The big geranium had grown, and covered the little\r\nwindow still more completely, and the fire burned with virulence,\r\nconscious of the frost. The minister\'s invalid daughter, with the\r\ncolourless face and sharp eyes, was still knitting, leaning back upon\r\nher pillows. Poor Mrs. Vincent, when she sat down, as near the door as\r\npossible, feeling as if she could not get breath, became immediately\r\naware that to confront those eyes was a more dangerous process than any\r\nwhich she had yet been subjected to in Carlingford. They penetrated\r\nthrough her, keen with the restless life and curiosity, which made up to\r\nthat disabled woman for the privations of her existence. In the dim\r\ngreen parlour the minister\'s mother saw nothing but Adelaide Tufton\'s\r\neyes. If they had been beautiful eyes the effect would have been less\r\nsurprising; but they were not beautiful; they were pale blue, and had\r\nsomething of the shrill shining of a rainy sky in the glistening white,\r\nwhich counted for far more than the faint watery colour. Mrs. Vincent\r\ngave way before them as she had never yet done. She cast down her own\r\neyes, and drew back her chair, and even faltered in her speech, when she\r\nwas obliged to face their observation. The danger was all the greater\r\nfor being unexpected. As for Mrs. Tufton, that good woman was in a\r\nflutter of interest and sympathy. She wanted to know whether Susan had\r\ngone through all the orthodox number of fevers and youthful ailments,\r\nand was in her element talking of the merits of camphor as a preventive,\r\nand of all the means that might be used to avoid infection.\r\n\r\n"When my children were young, and their papa always being noted for so\r\nactive a man among his people, I don\'t know what I should have done if I\r\nhad been easily frightened," said Mrs. Tufton. "Don\'t worry--keep her\r\nquiet, and give her----"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Vincent never said she was afraid of infection," said Adelaide.\r\n"Is it typhus fever? My mother jumps at everything, and never stops to\r\ninquire. I daresay it\'s something quite different. Love affairs? Oh no;\r\nof course we don\'t want you to tell us. I don\'t think Phoebe Tozer\r\nwill die of her failure. This young man from Homerton will console her.\r\nHas your son recovered his little affair with the young Dowager, Mrs.\r\nVincent? He dined there, you know. I daresay his head was turned; but\r\nthere is one safeguard with those fine ladies. If a man has his wits\r\nabout him, he can always know that they mean nothing all the time."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I don\'t know what you mean. My son knows Lady Western, I\r\nbelieve; I remember one time he dined there. My Arthur," said the\r\nmother, with a faint smile, "is not one to have his head turned. He has\r\nbeen used to be thought a great deal of at home."\r\n\r\n"Ah, he\'s a precious young man!" said Mr. Tufton, see-sawing the air\r\nwith his large grey hand. "I am much interested in my dear young\r\nbrother. He thinks too much, perhaps--too much--of pleasing the carnal\r\nmind; and my people, that have been used to practical preaching so long,\r\nfind the difference. But when he has deeper experiences----"\r\n\r\n"Stuff!" said the invalid, turning her head half aside; "you know the\r\nchapel has filled since he came. Even when they are asses like your\r\nSalem people, you know they like a man with brains. I don\'t see that it\r\nmatters much what Mr. Vincent goes wrong in; he was sure to go wrong\r\nsomehow. I gave him six months, but he has got through the six months,\r\nand they have not killed him off yet. What does he mean, thrusting\r\nhimself into other people\'s messes? As far as I can make out, it\'s quite\r\na little tragedy. There was that Mrs. Hilyard, you know--the woman in\r\nBack Grove Street. Ah, you know her!" said Adelaide, keenly, seeing the\r\nlittle shiver with which the visitor received the name.\r\n\r\n"I have heard my son speak of her," said the widow, faintly.\r\n\r\n"She was some connection of the Bedford family," said Adelaide, going\r\non, with her curious eyes fixed on Mrs. Vincent\'s face, who quailed\r\nbefore her, "and she married a half brother of Lady Western\'s--a\r\ndesperate rascal he was. They had one baby, and then she left him--one\r\nbaby, a girl, that has grown up an idiot; and here this lady lives--a\r\npoor needle-woman--to keep the girl safe, somehow, out of her father\'s\r\nhand. Why he should want to have her I can\'t exactly tell. I suspect,\r\nbecause she\'s pretty, to make a decoy of her, and sell her somehow,\r\neither to be married, or worse----"\r\n\r\n"Adelaide!" cried Mrs. Tufton; "oh, my dear, do mind what you\'re saying;\r\nMrs. Vincent does not know you. What can she think if you talk like\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Vincent sees well enough I am not a girl to be frightened for\r\nwords," said the sick woman. "Now, what I want to know is, what has your\r\nson to do with it? He\'s gone off after them, now, for some reason or\r\nother; of course I don\'t expect you to tell me. Perhaps Lady Western has\r\nsent him?--never mind, I will find out; but I know it has something to\r\ndo with Mrs. Hilyard, for they both went off from Carlingford the same\r\nday. I have no share in life for myself," said Adelaide, with another\r\nkeen look at the stranger; "and so, instead of comforting myself that\r\nit\'s all for the best, as papa says, I interfere with my\r\nfellow-creatures. Oh, pray, don\'t be sorry for me! I get on as well as\r\nmost people. Nobody in this place ever succeeds in concealing anything\r\nfrom me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed it is a pity when people have anything to conceal," said poor\r\nMrs. Vincent, thinking, with a sensation of deadly sickness at her\r\nheart, of the awful secret which was in Mary\'s keeping, and faltering,\r\nin spite of all her self-command. She rose up hurriedly, when she met\r\nonce more the glance of those sharp eyes: she could not bear that\r\ninvestigation; all her dreadful suspense and excitement seemed to ooze\r\nout unawares, and betray themselves; her only safety seemed in flight.\r\n\r\n"This is a very short visit," said Mr. Tufton. "My dear anxious sister,\r\nwe can only pray you may be comforted. All things work together for\r\ngood; you don\'t need to be told that. It\'s sure to be for the best,\r\nwhatever happens: take that consolation to your heart--it\'s sure to be\r\nfor the best."\r\n\r\n"If her daughter dies and her son is dismissed, I wonder will that be\r\nfor the best?" said Adelaide Tufton, as soon as the widow had left the\r\nroom. Mrs. Vincent\'s ears, made acute by suffering, caught enough of\r\nthis valedictory address to realise, if that were possible, an\r\nadditional pang. Kind Mrs. Tufton did not hear it, not being in any such\r\nstate of feverish susceptibility. She, on the contrary, kissed the\r\nmother, whom she pitied with all her heart, and entreated her not to\r\nworry. "A young healthy girl does not fall ill for nothing. You\'ll see\r\nthings will turn out all right," said the kind soul; and Mrs. Vincent\r\nwent upon her forlorn way.\r\n\r\nAt Mrs. Tozer\'s the minister\'s mother found a little committee\r\nassembled. Mrs. Brown was there from the Devonshire Dairy, and Mrs.\r\nPigeon, whose gratification in being able to hail Mrs. Vincent as an\r\nacquaintance, to the confusion of the dairywoman and amazement of Mrs.\r\nTozer, almost restored the minister to that lady\'s favour. They were in\r\nthe drawing-room, where, in honour of the expected visitors, a fire had\r\nbeen lighted; and as Mrs. Vincent ascended the dark staircase, she\r\nobtained a passing glimpse of Mr. Beecher seated at the table in the\r\nparlour studying "The Railway Guide," which Phoebe expounded to him,\r\nuntil they were both sent for up-stairs. Altogether the conjunction did\r\nnot look promising for Arthur\'s interests. She went in thrilling with a\r\ntouch of exasperation and defiance. Now was the time to make a final\r\nstand for Arthur. This covert rebellion could be deprecated no longer.\r\n\r\n"I expect my son home to-day," said the brave mother, gulping down all\r\nthe pangs of her expectation. "I think, now that I see for myself how\r\nmuch he is thought of in Carlingford, I ought to make an apology to the\r\nSalem people. It was I that induced him to go away, not thinking that\r\none Sunday would be such a great matter; but indeed it was very\r\ngratifying to me to see how disappointed everybody was. I hope Mr.\r\nBeecher will pardon me, for I am sure he preached us a very nice sermon,\r\nand we were all grateful for it; but, naturally on my dear boy\'s\r\naccount, to see how disappointed everybody was, was a great\r\ngratification to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I did not mind," said Mr. Beecher, with a little laugh of\r\nembarrassment; but the young man was much taken aback, and stared with\r\nastonished looks before he answered, at this totally unexpected address.\r\nHaving thus floored one of her adversaries, and seeing the female foe\r\nmore voluble and ready, quite prepared to answer her, Mrs. Vincent\r\nblandly proceeded.\r\n\r\n"And this, you know, Mrs. Tozer, was all the more gratifying to me,\r\nbecause I was not quite sure that Arthur had done wisely in choosing\r\nCarlingford. His dear father had so many friends in our denomination,\r\nand people are so kind as to speak of my boy as such a rising young man.\r\nBefore I knew Carlingford," said the widow, looking round her with an\r\nair of gentle superiority, "I used to regret my son had not accepted the\r\ninvitation from Liverpool. Many people said to me that his talents would\r\nhave had so much more room there; but I am reconciled now," she added,\r\nturning her mild eyes upon Mrs. Pigeon, who showed symptoms of\r\nresistance. "I may say I am quite satisfied now. He would have been\r\nbetter off, and had more opportunity of making himself a position in\r\nLiverpool, but what is that in comparison with the attachment of a\r\nflock?"\r\n\r\n"Well, indeed, that\'s just the thing, ma\'am," said Mrs. Brown, who\r\nimagined herself addressed; "we are fond of him. I always said he was an\r\nuncommon nice young man; and if he was but to settle down----"\r\n\r\n"That will come in time," said the minister\'s mother, graciously; "and I\r\nam glad, for my part, that he has been away, for it shows me how his\r\ndear people feel towards him; and though he would have been, of course,\r\nbetter off in Liverpool, I would never consider that in comparison. They\r\nstill want to have him, you know, and keep writing me letters, and him\r\ntoo, I don\'t doubt; but after what I have seen, I could never advise him\r\nto break the link that has been formed here. The connection between\r\npastor and people is a sacred tie; it should never be broken," said Mrs.\r\nVincent, with mild grandeur, "for anything so poor as a money object;\r\nbut my dear boy is far above any such consideration as that."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Mrs. Pigeon, drawing a long breath of involuntary awe and\r\nadmiration; "and I don\'t doubt as the pastor would have been a deal\r\nbetter off in Liverpool," she added, after a pause, quite overpowered by\r\nthat master-stroke.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a deal bigger a place," suggested Mrs. Tozer; "and grander folks,\r\nI don\'t have a doubt," she too added, after an interval. This new idea\r\ntook away their breath.\r\n\r\n"But, ah! what is that to affection," said Arthur\'s artful mother, "when\r\na minister has the love of his flock! My dear Mrs. Pigeon, though a\r\nmother is naturally anxious for her son, nothing on earth would induce\r\nme to advise him to break such a tie as that!"\r\n\r\n"And indeed, ma\'am, it\'s as a Christian mother should act," gasped the\r\npoulterer\'s subdued wife. Mrs. Brown made a little movement of admiring\r\nassent, much impressed with the fine sentiments of the minister\'s\r\nmother. Phoebe put her handkerchief to her eyes, and Mr. Beecher found\r\nit was time for his train. "Tell Vincent I am very glad to have been of\r\nuse to him. We were all delighted in \'Omerton to hear of him making such\r\nan \'it," said Mr. Beecher, friendly but discomfited. He made his\r\nleave-taking all round, before Mrs. Vincent, at the height of victory,\r\nrose and went her way. Then she, too, shook hands, and blandly parted\r\nwith the astonished women. They remained behind, and laid their heads\r\ntogether, much subdued, over this totally new light. She departed,\r\ngently victorious. This little demonstration had done her good. When she\r\ngot out into the street, however, she fell down again into those depths\r\nof despair out of which she had risen so bravely for Arthur\'s sake. She\r\nbegan to plan how she and Susan could go away--not to Lonsdale--never\r\nagain to Lonsdale--but to some unknown place, and hide their\r\nshame-stricken heads. She was so weary and sick in her heart, it was\r\nalmost a comfort to think of creeping into some corner, taking her poor\r\ndarling into her arms, healing those dreadful wounds of hers, hiding her\r\nfrom the sight of men. This was what they must do as soon as her dearest\r\nchild came back--go to Scotland, perhaps, or into the primitive south\r\ncountry, where nobody knew them, or---- but softly, who was this?\r\n\r\nA new claim upon the overworked anxious soul. At the door of her son\'s\r\nhouse stood a carriage--an open carriage--luxurious and handsome, with\r\ntwo fine horses impatiently pawing the air, and a very fine footman at\r\nthe door, talking to the little maid. Within the carriage, the same\r\nbeautiful young woman whom Mrs. Vincent remembered to have seen waving a\r\nlovely hand to Arthur. No doubt it was Lady Western. The beauty did not\r\nbewilder Mrs. Vincent as she had bewildered Mrs. Vincent\'s son; but,\r\nwith a thrill of mingled pride, admiration, and disapproval, she\r\nhastened forward at sight of her. Could she be asking for Arthur?--and\r\ncould Arthur have ventured to love that lovely creature in her radiance\r\nof wealth and rank? With a mother\'s involuntary self-delusion Mrs.\r\nVincent looked at the beautiful vision as at Arthur\'s possible bride,\r\nand was proud and displeased at the same moment; proud, that anything so\r\nlovely and splendid was to fall to her son\'s lot--disapproving, that\r\nArthur\'s chosen should offer a mark of favour even to Arthur, so much\r\nmore decided than accorded with the widow\'s old-fashioned notion of what\r\nbecame a woman. Mrs. Vincent did not think of the other figure by Lady\r\nWestern\'s side--a man of great height, very slight, and rapid in his\r\nmovements, with a long brown beard, and thoughtful eyes--eyes which\r\nlightened up and became as keen as they were dreamy, whenever occasion\r\narose. Why should the widow look at him? She had nothing to do with him.\r\nThis once in their life they were to come into momentary contact--never\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent ain\'t at home--but oh, look year!--here\'s his mother as can\r\ntell you better nor me," cried the half-frightened maid at the door.\r\n\r\n"His mother?" said the beautiful creature in the carriage; she had\r\nalighted in a moment, and was by Mrs. Vincent\'s side--"Oh, I am so glad\r\nto see Mr. Vincent\'s mother! I am Lady Western--he has told you of me?"\r\nshe said, taking the widow\'s hand; "take us in, please, and let us talk\r\nto you--we will not tease you--we have something important to say."\r\n\r\n"Important to us--not to Mrs. Vincent," said the gentleman who followed\r\nher, a remarkable figure, in his loose light-coloured morning dress; and\r\nhis eyes fell with a remorseful pity upon the widow, standing,\r\ndrawn-back, and self-restrained, upon the ground of her conscious\r\nmisery, not knowing whether to hope that they brought her news, or to\r\nsteel herself into a commonplace aspect of civility. This man had a\r\nheart; he looked from the brilliant creature before him, all flushed and\r\nradiant with her own happiness, to the little woman by her side, in her\r\npitiful widow\'s dress, in her visible paleness and desperation of\r\nself-control. It was he who had brought Lady Western here to put his own\r\ninnocence beyond doubt, but the cruelty of that selfish impulse struck\r\nhim now as he saw them stand together. "Important to us--not to Mrs.\r\nVincent," he said again, taking off his hat to her with devout respect.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! to us," said Lady Western, looking up to him with a momentary\r\ngleam of love and happiness. Then the pretty tender-hearted creature\r\nchanged her look, and composed her countenance into sympathy. "I am so\r\nsorry for you, dear Mrs. Vincent!" she said, with the saddest voice. At\r\nthis the widow on her part started, and was recalled to herself.\r\n\r\n"I am a stranger in Carlingford," said the mild little woman, drawing up\r\nher tiny figure. "I do not know what has procured me this pleasure--but\r\nall my son\'s friends are welcome to me. I will show you the way\r\nup-stairs," she continued, going up before them with the air of dignity\r\nwhich, after the hard battles and encounters and bitter wounds of this\r\nday, became the heroic little figure. She sent Mary, who started up in\r\ndismay at her entrance, into another room, and gave Lady Western a\r\nchair, but herself continued standing, always the conservator of\r\nArthur\'s honour. If Arthur loved her, who was this man? why did such\r\nglances pass between them? Mrs. Vincent stood erect before Lady Western,\r\nand did not yield even to the winning looks for which poor Arthur would\r\nhave given his life.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear Mrs. Vincent, I am so sorry for you!" said Lady Western again;\r\n"I know it all, and it makes my heart bleed to think of it. I will be\r\nyour friend and your daughter\'s friend as long as I live, if you will\r\nlet me. Oh, don\'t shut your heart against me! Mr. Vincent trusts me, and\r\nso must you; and I am heartbroken to think all that you must have gone\r\nthrough----"\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said Mrs. Vincent, with a gasp. "I--I cannot tell--what you\r\nmean," she articulated, with difficulty, holding by the table to support\r\nherself, but looking with unflinching eyes in her new persecutor\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t shut your heart against me!" cried the young dowager, with\r\ngenuine tears in her lovely eyes. "This gentleman was with Mr. Vincent\r\nyesterday--he came up here this morning. He is--Mr. Fordham." She broke\r\noff abruptly with a terrified cry. But Mrs. Vincent had not died or\r\nfainted standing rigid there before her, as the soft creature thought.\r\nHer eyes had only taken that blank lustreless gaze, because the force of\r\nemotion beneath was too much for them, and inexpressible. Even in that\r\nextremity, it was in the widow\'s heart, wrung to desperation, to keep\r\nher standing-ground of assumed ignorance, and not to know what this\r\nsudden offer of sympathy could mean.\r\n\r\n"I do not know--the gentleman," she said, slowly, trying to make the\r\nshadow of a curtsy to him. "I am sorry to seem uncivil; but I am tired\r\nand anxious. What--what did you want of me?" she asked, in a little\r\noutburst of uncontrollable petulance, which comforted Lady Western. It\r\nwas a very natural question. Surely, in this forlorn room, where she had\r\npassed so many wretched hours, her privacy might have been sacred; and\r\nshe was jealous and angry at the sight of Fordham for Arthur\'s sake. It\r\nwas another touch in the universal misery. She looked at Lady Western\'s\r\nbeauty with an angry heart. For these two, who ventured to come to her\r\nin their happiness, affronting her anguish, was Arthur\'s heart to be\r\nbroken too?\r\n\r\n"We wanted--our own ends," said Fordham, coming forward. "I was so cruel\r\nas to think of myself, and that you would prove it was another who had\r\nassumed my name. Forgive me--it was I who brought Lady Western here; and\r\nif either of us can serve you, or your daughter--or your son--" added\r\nFordham, turning red, and looking round at his beautiful companion----\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent could bear it no longer. She made a hasty gesture of\r\nimpatience, and pointed to the door. "I am not well enough, nor happy\r\nenough, to be civil," cried Arthur\'s mother; "we want nothing--nothing."\r\nHer voice failed her in this unlooked-for exasperation. A few bitter\r\ntears came welling up hot to her eyes. It was very different from the\r\nstupor of agony--it was a blaze of short-lived passion, which almost\r\nrelieved, by its sense of resentment and indignation, a heart worn out\r\nwith other emotions. Fordham himself, filled with compunction, led Lady\r\nWestern to the door; but it was not in the kind, foolish heart of the\r\nyoung beauty to leave this poor woman in peace. She came back and seized\r\nMrs. Vincent\'s trembling hands in her own; she begged to be allowed to\r\nstay to comfort her; she would have kissed the widow, who drew back,\r\nand, half fainting with fatigue and excitement, still kept her erect\r\nposition by the table. Finally, she went away in tears, no other means\r\nof showing her sympathy being practicable. Mrs. Vincent dropped down on\r\nher knees beside the table as soon as she was alone, and leaned her\r\naching, throbbing head upon it. Oh, dreadful lingering day, which was\r\nnot yet half gone! Unconsciously groans of suffering, low but repeated,\r\ncame out of her heart. The sound brought Mary, with whom no concealment\r\nwas possible, and who gave what attendance and what sympathy she might\r\nto her mistress\'s grievous trouble. Perhaps the work of this dreadful\r\nday was less hard than the vigil to which the mother had now to nerve\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS it possible that she had slept? A moment ago and it was daylight--a\r\nred sunset afternoon: now the pale half-light, struggling with the black\r\ndarkness, filled the apartment. She was lying on the sofa where Mary had\r\nlaid her, and by her side, upon a chair within her reach, was some tea\r\nuntasted, which Mary must have brought after she had fallen into that\r\nmomentary slumber. The fire burned brightly, with occasional little\r\noutbreaks of flame. Such a silence seemed in the house--silence that\r\ncrept and shuddered--and to think she should have slept!\r\n\r\nThe night had found covert in all the corners, so dark they were; but\r\none pale line of light came from the window, and the room had a little\r\nruddy centre in the fire. Mrs. Vincent, in the poignant anguish of her\r\nawakening, grew superstitious; some other breath--some other\r\npresence--seemed in the room besides her own. She called "Mary," but\r\nthere was no answer. In her excited condition anything was possible--the\r\nbounds of the living world and the possible seemed gone for ever. She\r\nmight see anything--hear anything--in the calm of her desperation. She\r\ngot up, and hastily lighted the candle which stood on the table. As she\r\nlooked over the little light a great cry escaped her. What was it?\r\nrising darkly, rising slowly, out of the shadows in which it had been\r\ncrouching, a huddled indistinct figure. Oh God! not Susan! not her\r\nchild! As it rose slowly facing her, the widow cried aloud once more,\r\nand put her hand over her eyes to shut out the dreadful vision. Ghastly\r\nwhite, with fixed dilated eyes--with a figure dilated and\r\ngrandiose--like a statue stricken into marble, raised to grandeur--could\r\nit be Susan who stood there, without a word, without a movement, only\r\nwith a blank dark gaze at the horrified woman, who dared not meet those\r\ndreadful eyes? When life rallied in Mrs. Vincent\'s horror-stricken\r\nheart, she went to the ghastly creature, and put warm arms round it, and\r\ncalled it Susan! Susan! Had it any consciousness at all, this dreadful\r\nghost? had it come from another world? The mother kissed it with lips\r\nthat woke no answer--held it motionless in her trembling arms. She cried\r\nagain aloud--a great outcry--no longer fearing anything. What were\r\nappearances now? If it was Susan, it was Susan dead whom she held, all\r\nunyielding and terrible in her warm human arms.\r\n\r\nMary heard and came with exclamations of terror and sympathy. They got\r\nher between them to the fire, and chafed her chill hands and feet.\r\nNobody knew how she had got in, where she had come from; no one was with\r\nher--no one had admitted her. She sat a marble woman in the chair where\r\nthey had placed her, unresistant, only gazing, gazing--turning her awful\r\neyes after her mother. At last she drew some long gasping breaths, and,\r\nwith a shudder which shook her entire frame, seemed to come to herself.\r\n"I am Susan Vincent," said the awful ghost. No tears, nor cries, nor\r\nwild pressure of her mother\'s arms, nor entreaties poured into her cold\r\near, could extract any other words. Mrs. Vincent lost her\r\nself-possession: she rushed out of the room for remedies--rung the\r\nbell--called for Arthur in a voice of despair--could nobody help her,\r\neven in this horrible crisis? When she had roused the house she\r\nrecollected herself, and shut the door upon the wondering strangers, and\r\nreturned once more to her hopeless task. "Oh, Mary! what are we to do?\r\nOh, Susan, my child, my darling! speak to your poor mother," cried the\r\nwidow; but the marble figure in the chair, which was Susan, made no\r\nreply. It began to shiver with dreadful trembling fits--to be convulsed\r\nwith long gasping sobs. "I am--Susan--Susan Vincent"--it said at\r\nintervals, with a pitiful iteration. The sight of her daughter in this\r\nfrightful condition, coming after all her fatigue and strain of\r\nexcitement, unnerved Mrs. Vincent completely. She had locked the door in\r\nher sudden dismay. She was kneeling, clasping Susan\'s knees--wasting\r\nvain adjurations upon her--driven beyond hope, beyond sense, beyond\r\ncapacity. Little rustic Mary had all the weight of the emergency thrown\r\nupon her shoulders. It was she who called to the curious landlady\r\noutside to send for the doctor, and who managed to get Susan put into\r\nher mother\'s bed. When they had succeeded in laying her down there, a\r\nlong interval, that seemed like years, passed before Dr. Rider came. The\r\nbed was opposite the window, through which the pale rays of the\r\ntwilight were still trembling. The candle on the other side showed Mrs.\r\nVincent walking about the room wringing her hands, now and then coming\r\nto the bedside to look at the unconscious form there, rent by those\r\ngasping sobs, uttering those dreadful words. Mary stood crying at the\r\nfoot of the bed. As for the widow, her eyes were tearless--her heart in\r\nan intolerable fever of suffering. She could not bear it. She said aloud\r\nshe could not bear it--she could not bear it! Then she returned again to\r\ncall vainly upon her child, her child! Her strength had given way--she\r\nhad spent all her reserves, and had nothing to resist this unexpected\r\nclimax of misery.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when Dr. Rider came. Mary held the candle for him as\r\nhe felt Susan\'s pulse, and examined her wide-open eyes. The doctor knew\r\nnothing about her any more than if he had not been a doctor. He said it\r\nmust have been some dreadful mental shock, with inquiring looks at Mrs.\r\nVincent, who began to recover herself. He put back the heavy locks of\r\ngolden brown hair, which had been loosened down from Susan\'s head, and\r\nsaid he was afraid there was pressure on the brain. What could he\r\nsay?--he knew nothing more about it. He left some simple directions,\r\nsaid he would send some medicine, and took Mrs. Vincent into a corner to\r\nask what it was. "Some severe mental shock?" asked Dr. Rider; but,\r\nbefore she could reply, a cab drove rapidly up to the door, and sounds\r\nof a sudden arrival were audible in the house. "Oh, doctor, thank God,\r\nmy son is come--now I can bear it," said the widow. Dr. Rider, who was\r\nof a compassionate nature, waited with pitying eyes till the minister\r\nshould come up, and went to take another look at the patient, relieved\r\nto think he could speak to her brother, instead of racking her mother\'s\r\nheart. Mrs. Vincent grew calm in the sudden consolation of thinking\r\nArthur at hand. She sat down by the bedside, with her eyes fixed on the\r\ndoor, yearning for her son, the only living creature from whom she could\r\nhave entire sympathy. Was it necessary that they should speak so loudly\r\nas they came up-stairs?--could he be bringing a stranger with him to\r\nSusan\'s sickroom? Her heart began to beat louder with mingled\r\nexpectation and displeasure. It was not like Arthur--and there was no\r\nsound of his voice in the noise that swept up the stair. She rose up\r\ninstinctively as the footsteps approached--heavy steps, not like her\r\nson\'s. Then the door was thrown open. It was not Arthur who stood upon\r\nthe dim threshold. It was a stranger in a rough travelling-coat,\r\nexcited, resolute, full of his own errand. He made a stride into the\r\nroom to the bedside, thrusting Mrs. Vincent aside, not wittingly, but\r\nbecause she was in his way. Mary stood at the other side with the\r\ndoctor, holding up the one pale candle, which threw a flickering light\r\nupon the marble white figure on the bed, and the utter consternation and\r\nsurprise in Dr. Rider\'s face. Mrs. Vincent, too much alarmed and\r\nastonished to offer any resistance, followed the man who had thus\r\nentered into her sanctuary of anguish. He knew what he was doing, though\r\nnobody else did. He went straight forward to the bed. But the sight of\r\nthe unconscious figure there appalled the confident stranger. "It is\r\nshe, sure enough," he said; "are you a doctor, sir? is the lady taken\r\nill? I\'ve come after her every step of the way. She\'s in my custody now.\r\nI\'ll not give any trouble that I can help, but I must stay here."\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent, who scarcely could endure to hear, and did not understand,\r\nrushed forward while he was speaking, and seized him by the arm--"Leave\r\nthe room!" she cried with sudden passion--"He has made some impudent\r\nmistake, doctor. God help me!--will you let my child be insulted? Leave\r\nthe room, sir--leave the room, I say! This is my daughter, Miss Vincent,\r\nlying here. Mary, ring the bell--he must be turned out of the room.\r\nDoctor, doctor! you are a man; you will never let my child be insulted\r\nbecause her brother is away."\r\n\r\n"What does it mean?" cried Dr. Rider--"go outside and I will come and\r\nspeak to you. Miss Vincent is in a most dangerous state--perhaps dying.\r\nIf you know her----"\r\n\r\n"Know her, doctor! you are speaking of my child," cried Mrs. Vincent,\r\nwho faced the intruder with blazing eyes. The man held his ground, not\r\nimpertinently, but with steadiness.\r\n\r\n"I know her fast enough," he said; "I\'ve tracked her every step of the\r\nway; not to hurt the lady\'s feelings, I can\'t help what I\'m doing, sir.\r\nIt\'s murder;--I can\'t let her out of my sight."\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent clasped her hands together with a grasp of desperation.\r\n"What is murder?" she said, in a voice that echoed through the room. The\r\ndoctor, with an exclamation of horror, repeated the same question.\r\nMurder! it seemed to ring through the shuddering house.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard upon a lady, not to say her mother," said the man,\r\ncompassionately; "but I have to do my duty. A gentleman\'s been shot\r\nwhere she\'s come from. She\'s the first as suspicion falls on. It often\r\nturns out as the one that\'s first suspected isn\'t the criminal. Don\'t\r\nfret, ma\'am," he added, with a glance of pity, "perhaps it\'s only as a\r\nwitness she\'ll be wanted--but I must stay here. I daren\'t let her out of\r\nmy sight."\r\n\r\nThere was a dreadful pause. Mrs. Vincent looked up at the two men before\r\nher with a heartrending appeal in her eyes. Would anybody tell her what\r\nit meant?--would nobody interfere for Susan? She moaned aloud\r\ninarticulate in her voiceless misery. "And Arthur is not here!" was the\r\noutcry which at last burst from her heart. She was beyond feeling what\r\nthis was--her senses were confused with extremity of suffering. She only\r\nfelt that another blow had been dealt at her, and that Arthur was not\r\nhere to help to bear it. Then the stranger, who had put himself so\r\nhorribly in possession of Susan\'s sickroom, once more began to speak.\r\nThe widow could not tell what he said--the voice rang in her ears like a\r\nnoise of unmeaning sound, but it stirred her to a flush of female\r\npassion, as violent as it was shortlived. She sprang forward and took\r\nhold of his arm with her white little trembling hand: "Not here--not\r\nhere!" cried the mother in her passion. With her feeble force excited\r\ninto something irresistible, she put the astonished stranger out of the\r\nroom before he knew what she was doing. If an infant had done it the man\r\ncould not have been more utterly astonished. Outside, the people of the\r\nhouse were standing in an excited group. She thrust the dreadful\r\nmessenger of justice out with those hands that shook with tremors of\r\nanguish and weakness. She shut the door upon him with all her feeble\r\nstrength, locked it, put a chair against it; then she stumbled and fell\r\nas she stretched out for another--fell down upon her knees, poor soul!\r\nand remained so, forgetting, as it seemed, how she came there, and\r\ngradually, by instinct, putting together the hands which trembled like\r\nleaves in the wind--"Lord, Lord!" cried the mother, hovering on the wild\r\nverge between passion and insensibility. She called Him by name only as\r\nutter anguish alone knows how; she had nothing to tell Him; she could\r\nonly call upon Him by His name.\r\n\r\nDr. Rider took the half-insensible form up in his arms and carried her\r\nto the bedside, where Susan still lay motionless with her eyes wide\r\nopen, in an awful abstraction and unconsciousness. He put Mrs. Vincent\r\ntenderly into the chair, and held the hands that shook with that palsied\r\nirrestrainable tremor. "No one can bring her to life but you," said the\r\ndoctor, turning the face of the miserable mother towards her child. "She\r\nhas kept her senses till she reached you; when she was here she no\r\nlonger wanted them; she has left her life in your hands." He held those\r\nhands fast as he spoke; pressed them gently, but firmly; repeated his\r\nwords over again. "In your hands," said the doctor once more, struck to\r\nhis heart with horror and pity. Susan\'s bare beautiful arm lay on the\r\ncoverlid, white, round, and full, like marble. The doctor, who had never\r\nseen the fair Saxon girl who was Mrs. Vincent\'s daughter a week ago,\r\nthought in his heart that this full developed form and face, rapt to\r\ngrandeur by the extremity of woe, gave no contradiction to the\r\naccusation he had just heard with so much horror. That week had\r\nobliterated Susan\'s soft girlish innocence and the simplicity of her\r\neighteen years. She was a grand form as she lay there upon that\r\nbed--might have loved to desperation--fallen--killed. Unconsciously he\r\nuttered aloud the thought in his heart--"Perhaps it would be better she\r\nshould die!"\r\n\r\nThen the mother rose. Once more her painful senses came back to the\r\nwoman who was still the minister\'s mother, and, even in this hideous\r\ndream of misery, had not forgotten the habits of her life. "When my son\r\ncomes he will settle it all," said Mrs. Vincent. "I expect him--any\r\ntime--he may come any minute. Some one has made--a mistake. I don\'t know\r\nwhat that man said; but he has made--a mistake, doctor. My son, Mr.\r\nVincent, will see to all that. It has nothing to do with us. Tell me\r\nwhat we are to do for my child. Cut off her hair? Oh, yes, yes,\r\nanything! I don\'t mind it, though it is a sacrifice. She has had--a--a\r\ngreat fright, doctor. She could not tell me particulars. When her\r\nbrother comes home, we will hear all--" said the widow, looking with a\r\njealous gaze in his eyes to see if he believed her. The scene altogether\r\novercame Dr. Rider. He turned away and went to the other side of the\r\nroom, and took a glass of water from the table before he could answer\r\nher or meet that appeal. Then he soothed her as he best could with\r\ndirections about Susan. He went away immediately to come back in an\r\nhour, if perhaps there might be any change--so he said; but, in reality,\r\nhe wanted to escape, to hear this dreadful story, to think what was\r\nbest. Friendless, with nobody near to protect them, and the officer of\r\njustice waiting at the door, what were these women to do? perhaps death\r\nwaited closer than the visible messenger of fate. Would it be well to\r\nstay that more merciful executioner on his way?\r\n\r\nThe doctor found the officer outside the door, waiting, not without\r\npity, at his post. He heard what was this man\'s version of the strange\r\ntragedy--strange, and yet not unfamiliar to human ears. The young woman\r\nhad been betrayed and ruined. In wild vengeance and misery she had\r\nseized one of her seducer\'s pistols and shot him through the head--such\r\nwas the story. And now she had fled from the scene of the murder,\r\ntracked step by step by the avenger. The whole house was in a tumult, as\r\nmay be supposed. The indignant landlady, who was a member of Salem,\r\ncould scarcely be prevented going into the jealously-closed room and\r\nturning out the unhappy criminal. Another lodger, a nervous woman, had\r\nalready collected her goods to fly from the place. Outside, some\r\nmysterious instinct had collected a few people about the door of the\r\nhitherto irreproachable house, which imagination magnified into a\r\ncrowd. Already Tozer had set out from his shop, red with anger, to\r\ninquire into this incipient excitement, which nobody could explain. And\r\nstill Arthur had not appeared to stand by the miserable women in this\r\nhorrible climax of fate.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor went back to the room where Susan was, he found Mrs.\r\nVincent in a state of agitated activity. Mary and she were flitting\r\nabout the room, moving lights before Susan\'s eyes, making what noises\r\nthey could with the furniture, keeping a fantastic commotion about the\r\nbed. "She stirred, doctor, and we were trying to rouse her," said the\r\nwidow, who had put everything but Susan\'s bodily extremity from her eyes\r\nat the moment. The doctor, who was desperate, and whose heart was moved,\r\nresorted to desperate measures. He gathered them about the bed, set Mrs.\r\nVincent to support the insensible form, and raising that white marble\r\narm which had developed into such glorious proportion, touched the\r\nswollen blue vein with his lancet. The touch acted like magic. In\r\nanother moment she had struggled up out of her mother\'s grasp, and\r\nthrown out the arm, from which the blood flowed, up above her head: the\r\ncrimson stream caught her wild eye as she raised her arm in the air. A\r\nconvulsive shudder shook her frame. She threw herself over on her face\r\nwith a cry of horror, far more than a match, in her strength of youth\r\nand passion, for the agitated arms that held her. "Mother, mother,\r\nmother! it is his blood! it is his life!" cried that despairing voice.\r\nThe confused bed, the convulsed frame, the flowing blood, all pitifully\r\nlighted up by Mary\'s candle, made up of themselves a scene like murder;\r\nand Dr. Rider vainly tried to forget the dreadful words which forced\r\nupon his mind their untimely testimony. He shuddered at the touch of\r\nthat white woman\'s hand as he bound up the wounded arm. He withdrew his\r\neyes from the pallid grandeur of the stricken face. In spite of himself,\r\nhorror mingled with his pity. A heavier stain was upon her than those\r\ncrimson traces on her pearly skin. Other words followed in an incoherent\r\nstream. Fever of the heart and brain, burning up into consuming frenzy,\r\nhad seized upon this lost creature, who was no longer a girl or\r\ninnocent. Ere long they had to send for nurses, to restrain her\r\ndelirium. She, raving with a wild madness which betrayed in every\r\nwandering exclamation the horror upon her soul, lay desperate in the\r\nroom which had enclosed for so many lingering hours her mother\'s anguish\r\nof suspense and fear. In an adjoining room, the man who had followed her\r\nto this refuge still waited, watchful yet pitiful, intent that his\r\nprisoner should not escape him. While outside a few gazers lingered,\r\nlooking up at the lights in the windows, with a strange perception that\r\nsomething unusual had happened, though nobody knew what it was. Such was\r\nthe scene upon which Arthur Vincent, not unwarned, yet incredulous, came\r\nsuddenly with eyes of horror and wild indignation as he reached his own\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Vincent was set down, in the darkness and silence of the Sunday\r\nnight, in the Dover railway station, it was some minutes before he could\r\ncollect himself, and understand where he was. He had fallen into a\r\nfeverish sleep during the journey, little as he could have supposed\r\nhimself capable of sleeping at such a moment; but he was young, and\r\nunused to the ceaseless fatigue and excitement and total want of rest\r\nwhich had obliterated for him the natural distinction between night and\r\nday. While his fellow-passengers trooped away with all the bustle and\r\nexcitement of travellers, who had then only completed the first stage of\r\ntheir journey, to the pier and the night-boat which waited to carry them\r\nacross the Channel, he, whom various porters and attendants stimulated\r\nwith adjurations to make haste, and warnings that he would be late,\r\nstumbled out into the dark, collecting his faculties, and trying to\r\nthink what he must do first. He was giddy and feverish with that\r\ninsufficient snatch of sleep which had lost him the time in which he\r\nmight have been laying his plans. But when he got outside the station\r\ninto the unknown place, into the gloom of night, and heard the "moanings\r\nof the homeless sea" sounding sullen against the unseen shore,\r\nrecollection and energy came back to him. That very sound, booming\r\nthrough the darkness, inspired Susan\'s brother. He thought of her\r\nforlorn, desolate, succourless, a weary wanderer seeking rest and\r\nfinding none, shrouded up in darkness and danger, lost in the mysterious\r\ngloom--such was the sentiment of the night. The minister went on rapidly\r\nto the town, with its restless lights, through which everybody seemed to\r\nbe passing towards the unseen sea. Should he follow with the stream, or\r\nshould he stop at the hotel of which Mary had told him? He quickened his\r\nsteps as he reached the open door of the inn, and plunged in to make\r\nrapid inquiries. Nobody knew either Colonel Mildmay or Mr. Fordham, but\r\nthe party which he described had been there, and had left only an hour\r\nbefore--not for the boat, the attendants thought: but the boat was\r\nringing its bells through the night; and if by chance they had gone\r\nthere, no time was to be lost. He rushed from the inn as fast as his\r\nwearied limbs could carry him to the pier, where the lookers-on stood\r\naside out of his way, recognising his excitement. He went through among\r\nall the passengers with the rough captain and his lantern, having\r\nbriefly explained to that functionary what he wanted. But they were not\r\nthere. When he had satisfied himself, he left the boat, and stood with\r\nsuspicious reluctance, unwilling to lose sight of it, on the pier, and\r\nwatched the coloured lamp on the mast of the steamer gradually gliding\r\nthrough the darkness out of the sheltering harbour, till it began to\r\nplunge and heave on the unseen sea. Then he took his troubled way back\r\nto the inn. It was very late, and all the population seemed to\r\ndisappear out of the streets, with the little attendant crowd which had\r\nbeen waiting upon the last event of the day, the departure of this\r\nnight-boat. The inn itself looked half asleep, and was half closed when\r\nhe returned. No further arrivals, no incidents in the shape of trains or\r\nboats, were to be looked for till the morning. It was the first time\r\nthat Arthur had encountered this compulsory pause of night. He struggled\r\nagainst it for some time, questioning the waiters, and gleaning some\r\nparticulars which did but increase his anxiety, but the waiters\r\nthemselves were sleepy, and all the world around had closed itself up in\r\nutter quietness and rest.\r\n\r\nVincent went out again, but he could get admittance nowhere, save at the\r\noffice of the police, where he went in desperation to ask the services\r\nof some one skilful in such inquiries. He found this not without\r\ndifficulty, but nothing was to be done that night. He had to go back to\r\nthe hotel to consent to the necessary rest for which, notwithstanding\r\nthe fever of his mind, his worn-out frame craved. Weariness, indeed, had\r\ngradually overpowered and absorbed him--stronger than anxiety, more\r\nurgent even than his love for his sister, was this present and\r\nover-powering exhaustion which began to occupy all his thoughts. Though\r\nhe struggled with it he could not but feel in his heart, with a certain\r\nguilt, how this overwhelming desire to throw himself down somewhere and\r\nrest possessed him to the exclusion of more worthy impulses. After he\r\nhad ordered some refreshment, of which, indeed, he stood as much in\r\nneed, the young man threw himself upon a sofa, and there fell into a\r\ndeep sleep of utter weariness. He could do no more. He slept as youth\r\nmust sleep, were it on the edge of a precipice, were it at the deathbed\r\nof its dearest friend. The very waiter who brought in the food he had\r\nordered, took pity upon the worn-out slumberer. The man heaped up the\r\nfire, and covered Vincent with his railway wrapper before he withdrew;\r\nand it was not till morning that the young minister awoke out of that\r\nprofound slumber--awoke chilled and aching, and confused, in the dark,\r\nwith the untouched meal still on the table, the candle flaming in its\r\nsocket, and he himself totally unaware how long he had been asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the interval that elapsed before the first sounds of awakening life\r\nin the house, he had time to collect himself, and when he went\r\ndown-stairs to the coffee-room, still in the dark of the winter morning,\r\nhad regained more command of himself and his powers than at any previous\r\nmoment since this misery came upon him.\r\n\r\nBut it was still so early that the fire was scarcely alight, and he had\r\nto wait for the cup of coffee he ordered. Vincent went to the window, as\r\nwas natural--a large window looking into the dark street, faintly\r\nlighted with lamps, which somehow burned less bright in the chill of the\r\nmorning than they did at night. Looking out vaguely, yet with the\r\nvigilance of anxiety, without being able to discriminate anything except\r\nhere and there a dark figure passing in the darkness, the young man\r\nwaited with his face close to the uncurtained panes. There was nothing\r\nin that blank undecipherable street to interest him, and yet he gazed\r\nout mechanically in the anxious pre-occupation of his mind. When the\r\nattendant came into the room with his coffee, his attention was\r\ntemporarily distracted. He got up to go to the table where breakfast was\r\nbeing arranged for him; but, as he rose, his eye was caught by the gleam\r\nof a passing face, ghastly white in the darkness, looking in. Before he\r\ncould draw breath, the apparition was gone. Without saying a word to the\r\nastonished waiter, who began to think him mad, Vincent dashed out after\r\nthis vanished vision. Two female figures were visible a little further\r\non in the gloomy street. He pursued them with breathless, noiseless\r\nspeed, and grasped at the arm of a terrified woman who, gasping with\r\nsudden fright, turned upon him a face he had never seen before. Nobody\r\nelse was to be seen in any direction. The minister made an inarticulate\r\napology, and turned back to search for some opening or passage through\r\nwhich that face could have disappeared. It was no fancy of his that\r\npainted that pale countenance upon the darkness--the same face that he\r\nhad seen in the railway carriage following Colonel Mildmay--the same,\r\nbut with a new look of horror and desperation in its eyes. The young man\r\ninvestigated, as he thought, every doorway, every corner which could\r\nhave given shelter to such a fugitive. He returned, excited and\r\nagitated, to the inn, to ask if there was any passage through the line\r\nof houses which he might have overlooked, but could hear of none. It was\r\non his lips to ask if they had heard of any crime or accident during\r\nthe night--any--murder; but prudence restrained the incautious\r\nutterance. He went out with the wildest agitation in his mind; something\r\nhad happened. Mrs. Hilyard\'s face, gleaming in unconscious at the\r\nwindow, betrayed to him much more clearly than any confession, that some\r\nnew and awful event had been added to that woman\'s strange experiences\r\nof life; and in the darkness he had been aware of some shadowy figure\r\nbeside her, accompanying her ghostly way. Perhaps her child--perhaps--could\r\nit be Susan? The young man went out, not knowing where he went, into the\r\ndarkness of the winter morning; he hastened to the pier, to the railway,\r\nstartling the half-awakened people about, but nowhere could either see\r\nor hear of her. Could it be a delusion? but the wildest imagination in\r\nthe world could not have inspired with such a new horror of expression\r\nthe eyes that gleamed out of that ghastly pale face.\r\n\r\nThe grey daylight had just got final mastery of the dark, when Vincent\r\nmet the man whom he had employed the night before to help him in his\r\ninquiries. This agent, more skilful than the minister, had found out the\r\ncab-driver who conveyed the party from the hotel on the previous\r\nevening. Colonel Mildmay seemed to have made the precipitate retreat of\r\na man suddenly startled and frightened out of his plans. The cabman gave\r\na detailed account of the strange conduct of his fare. "We was a-going\r\nto the pier to the Ostend steamer, sir," said the driver, "when I was\r\npulled up sharp, and got my directions to turn about sudden and go to\r\nthe railway. There was a lady as I see keeping her eye on us,\r\na-standing by the pier gates with her bag in her hand; but it was dark,\r\nand she couldn\'t have seen who was in the cab. The same occurred, sir,\r\nas we came up to the railway. I don\'t say as I see the lady there--but\r\nsure enough I was pulled up second time, and ordered out along the\r\nFolkestone road, a matter o\' three mile or so. Then I was turned back\r\nagain; and the end of all was that I took them to the Swan in Walmer\r\nStreet, as is a place where there\'s well-aired beds and chops, and that\r\nstyle o\' thing. That ain\'t the style of thing as is done in the Lord\r\nWarden. To take a fare, and partic\'lar along with ladies, from the one\r\nof them places to the other, looks queer--that\'s what it does; it looks\r\nvery queer, sir. It made me take a deal of notice. Gen\'leman tall,\r\nlight-haired, hook nose, awful swell to look at. Ladies, one on \'em\r\npretty tall, one little; pretty creatures, but dreadful skeared as far\r\nas I could see. The little one had a blue veil. That\'s them, sir;\r\nthought as I was right."\r\n\r\n"And you can take me to the place?" said Vincent.\r\n\r\n"Jump into my cab, and I\'ll have you there, sir, in five minutes," said\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nThe minister sprang into the cab alone. He no longer wanted the aid of a\r\nstranger; the darkling streets seemed to glide past him, and not he past\r\nthem, as he dashed on at last to find his sister, this time there could\r\nbe no mistake. After they had threaded several obscure streets, the\r\ndriver came to a sudden pause, got off his box, and touched his hat\r\nwith an alarmed look. "I can\'t drive up to the very \'ouse, sir--there\'s\r\na crowd around the door; they do say as something has happened. I hope\r\nit ain\'t to any of your friends?" said the cabman. Vincent flung the\r\ndoor open as he was speaking, and rushed out. A horrified and excited\r\ncrowd was besieging the door of the shabby public-house to which he had\r\nbeen brought. Seeing his hasty arrival, and the passionate anxiety in\r\nhis eyes, the crowd gave way before him, recognising his right of entry;\r\nthe very policeman at the door yielded to him in the force of his\r\npassion. "What is it?" he cried, aware of putting away some women and\r\nbabies from the door with mechanical kindness, but unconscious that he\r\nhad stumbled up the steps like a man in a dream, and was demanding an\r\nanswer to his question with an almost wild vehemence. The question was\r\nanswered by a dozen eager voices. It was murder--murder! He could make\r\nout nothing but the word in the confusion of many speakers and of his\r\nown mind. Nobody opposed his entrance or asked what business he had\r\nthere. He sprang up the stairs in two or three steps, pressed forward to\r\na half-open door, within which he saw some people assembled, and,\r\nunawares thrusting aside a man who stopped him, went into that chamber\r\nof death. Several people were around the bed--one, a surgeon, occupied\r\nwith the prostrate figure there. Vincent, over the heads of the\r\nspectators, gazed with burning eyes at this horrible spectacle. Susan\r\nherself, whom he did not expect to find there, nor could associate in\r\nany way with such a scene, faded out of his mind as he gazed with\r\nhaggard face and horror-stricken soul at the shattered head, bound up in\r\nbloody-bandages, scarce recognisable except by sharp eyes of love or\r\nhate, which rested on that mean pillow. He asked no questions for the\r\nmoment. To him alone the business needed no explanation. He was not even\r\nsurprised--he stood gazing in a momentary trance of horror at the\r\nlamentable sight. It was a wretched room, shabby and meagre, such a\r\nplace as only terror could have driven Mildmay to. Villain as he was,\r\nhis punishment had begun before that pistol-shot brought it to a\r\nclimax--even in his success he had been conscious that she would keep\r\nher word.\r\n\r\nThe policeman at the door touched Vincent on the sleeve, just as he\r\nturned from the dreadful spectacle before him. "Nobody is allowed in\r\nhere but for a good reason," said this man, gazing suspiciously at the\r\nstranger; "unless you knows something about it, or have come to identify\r\nthe poor gentleman, or are of some use somehow, I can\'t let you stay\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to stay here," said Vincent, turning away with a shudder.\r\n"I want to see the ladies who were with him. Yes, I know who he is--but\r\nI am not a friend of his; I have nothing to do with the matter. Where\r\nare the ladies who were with him? Miss Vincent," said the minister with\r\na pang, "and--and Miss Mildmay. I have come to take them away."\r\n\r\n"The ladies as were with him? Oh, it\'s them as you\'re awanting; perhaps\r\nyou\'ll stop a minute and talk to the inspector," said the policeman.\r\n"The ladies as were with him? Maybe you can tell the inspector\r\nsomething as will help justice? You didn\'t know the reason as brought\r\nout two young women a-travelling with a gen\'leman, did you? They\'ll want\r\nall the friends they can collect afore all\'s done. You come this way\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to get out of sight of that which horrified yet\r\nfascinated his eyes. Vincent followed the man into another room without\r\nobserving the evident suspicion with which he was regarded. "Where are\r\nthey?" he asked again. "I have a cab below. This is not a place for\r\nwomen. I have come to take them away. Where are the people of the house?\r\nWhat do you mean by keeping your hand on me? I want Miss Vincent. Do you\r\nhear me? I have nothing to do with Colonel Mildmay. He has plenty of\r\nfriends to avenge him. I want my sister. Where is she? Call the people\r\nof the house."\r\n\r\nVincent threw off the policeman\'s hand from his arm, and, looking for a\r\nbell, rang violently. He was too much horror-stricken, and too secure of\r\nfinding Susan, weeping and helpless in some corner, to show any of the\r\npassionate eagerness with which he had started on his search. Little\r\ndoubt she was there, poor lost soul. He shrank from meeting with her,\r\nnow that the meeting was so near; and his thoughts went after that other\r\ndesperate wretched woman, flying--who could tell where?--in despair and\r\ndarkness. The house was in utter disorder, as was natural; none of its\r\nhumble occupants being capable, at the present exciting moment, of\r\nattending to their usual duties. Vincent rang the bell again, till it\r\npealed and echoed through the place. Then he bethought himself, with a\r\nnatural shudder, of the death-chamber close by. He turned to the man by\r\nhis side, with an instinctive involuntary curiosity. "Is any one\r\nsuspected?" said the minister, feeling his face grow pale with a\r\ndreadful consciousness of the secret which he shared. But before he\r\ncould hear the answer, his second summons had brought up the terrified\r\nmistress of the house, attended half way up the stair by a throng of\r\ncurious women. He went hurriedly to meet her at the door.\r\n\r\n"Where are the ladies?" said the minister. "I have just heard that my\r\nsister was brought here last night. Tell her I am here. Take me to her.\r\nDon\'t be alarmed. You know what I mean? The two ladies--young ladies who\r\ncame here with Colonel Mildmay last night--where are they? Good heavens!\r\ndo you not understand what I mean?"\r\n\r\n"The young ladies, sir?" faltered the landlady, gasping and looking at\r\nthe man who still kept by Vincent\'s side. "Oh, Lord bless us! The young\r\nladies----"\r\n\r\n"Make haste and let them know I am here," said Vincent, gradually\r\ngrowing more and more anxious. "I will undertake to produce them if they\r\nare wanted as witnesses. Where are they?--where is my sister? I tell you\r\nshe is my sister. I have come for her. Tell Miss Vincent. Surely I am\r\nspeaking plain English," said the young man, with a flush of sudden\r\ndread. "The elder one, Miss Vincent--you understand me? Let her know\r\nthat I am here."\r\n\r\n"His sister! Oh, Lord bless us; and he don\'t know no more than the\r\nunborn," cried the woman of the house. "Oh, Lord! p\'liceman, can\'t you\r\ntell the poor gentleman? His sister! oh, that\'s worse than ever, that\r\nis. Some poor young thing as has been beguiled and led astray. Lord\r\nbless us! don\'t look at me o\' that way. I ain\'t to blame. Oh, gracious\r\nme, that I should have to tell the gentleman, and you standing there!\r\nOh, sir, it\'s her as has done it. She\'s gone away from here afore break\r\nof day. I don\'t blame her; oh, I don\'t blame her; don\'t look o\' that\r\ndreadful way at me. He\'s drove her to it with bad usage. She\'ll have to\r\nsuffer for it; but I don\'t blame her. I don\'t blame her if it was my\r\nlast word in life."\r\n\r\nVincent felt his tongue cleave to his mouth. He was stunned; he did not\r\nknow what he said--what he was hearing. "Blame her? whom? for what?" he\r\nsaid, with a mechanical effort. He seemed to himself to be suddenly\r\nengulfed in some horrible cloud, but he did not know what it meant.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord! don\'t look o\' that dreadful way at me; she\'s gone off from\r\nhere as soon as she done it," cried the woman. "She had that much sense\r\nleft, poor soul. He\'s drove her mad; he\'s drove her to it. My man says\r\nit can\'t be brought in no worse than manslaughter----"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand me," Vincent broke in; "you are talking of the\r\ncriminal. Who are you talking of?--but it does not matter. I want Miss\r\nVincent. Do you hear me?--the young lady whom he brought here last\r\nnight. Where is my sister? Gone away before daybreak! You mean the\r\ncriminal, but I want my sister. Susan! take me to where she is. She had\r\nnothing to do with it. I will give you anything--pay you anything, only\r\ntake me to where she is."\r\n\r\nHe moved towards the door as he spoke, half believing that, if he could\r\nbut hold out and refuse to credit this horror, Susan might still be\r\nfound. "Lord bless us! the poor young gentleman\'s gone out of his\r\nsenses," cried the landlady. "Let him go through all the house if that\'s\r\nwhat he wants. There ain\'t nothing to conceal in my house. I\'ll take you\r\nto the room as they were in--she and the other one. This way, sir. They\r\nhadn\'t nothing with them but two little bags, so there wasn\'t much to\r\nleave; but such as it is, being her night-things, is there. She wasn\'t\r\nthinking of bags, nor any of her little comforts, when she went away.\r\nHere, sir; walk in here."\r\n\r\nThe woman took him to a room up-stairs, where Vincent followed her\r\nmechanically. The room had evidently been occupied a very short time\r\nbefore. Upon a chair, open, with the contents only half thrust in, was a\r\ntravelling-bag, which the minister recognised at once--a piece of family\r\nproperty dreadful to see in such a place. Susan had been putting her\r\nthings away with the orderly instinct of her mother\'s daughter when this\r\nsudden shock of terror came upon her. "Do you mean to tell me that it is\r\nshe who has gone away," said Vincent, with a look of incredulous wonder\r\nand appeal--"she--Susan Vincent, my sister? Take time to think. It was\r\nnot she--somebody else. Tell me where she is----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, don\'t say anything as may come against her," cried the\r\nlandlady. "It\'s nobody but her, poor soul, poor soul. If it was possible\r\nto think as it could be another, I would--but there was nobody else to\r\ndo it. As soon as we heard the shot and the groan the master got up. He\r\nmet her on the stair, sir, if you\'ll believe me, like a woman as was\r\nwalking in her sleep. He was that struck he daren\'t say a word to her.\r\nHe let her pass by him and go out at the door--and when he went into the\r\ngentleman\'s room and found him there a-dying, she was gone clean off,\r\nand couldn\'t be heard of. Folks say as my husband should have stopped\r\nher, but it wasn\'t none of his business. Oh, sir, don\'t say nothing\r\nas\'ll put them on her track! There\'s one man gone off after her\r\nalready--oh, it\'s dreadful!--if you\'ll be advised by me, you\'ll slip out\r\nthe back way, and don\'t come across that policeman again. If she did\r\nkill him," cried the weeping landlady, "it was to save herself, poor\r\ndear. I\'ll let you out the back way, if you\'ll be guided by me."\r\n\r\nThe horror of this accusation had come home to Vincent\'s mind at last.\r\nHe saw, as if by a sudden flash of dreadful enlightenment, not guilt\r\nindeed, or its awful punishment, but open shame--the disgrace of\r\npublicity--the horrible suspicions which were of themselves more than\r\nenough to kill the unhappy girl. He made a great effort to speak, but\r\ncould not for the moment. He thrust in the white soft garments which\r\nwere hanging out of it, into that familiar bag, which somehow gave him a\r\npang more acute than all the terrible news he was hearing. He had\r\ntravelled with it himself on innocent boyish journeys, had seen it in\r\nhis mother\'s innocent hands--and now to find it in this shuddering\r\natmosphere of crime and mystery! He too shuddered as he roused himself\r\nto speak. "Hush--hush," said Vincent, "you mistake, my sister has\r\nnothing to do with it; I--I can prove that--easily," said the minister,\r\ngetting the words out with difficulty. "Tell me how it all\r\nhappened--when they came here, what passed; for instance----" He paused,\r\nand his eye caught another evidence of the reality of his horrible\r\nposition. It was the blue veil which he had followed and described, and\r\nlooked for through all these weary hours. He took it up in his hand,\r\ncrushing it together with an almost ungovernable impulse of rage, from\r\nwhere it had been thrown down on the shabby carpet. "For instance," said\r\nSusan\'s brother, restraining himself, "where is the girl who wore this?\r\nYou said Miss Vincent went away alone--where was the other? was she left\r\nbehind--is she here?"\r\n\r\nThe policeman had followed them up into the room in natural curiosity\r\nand suspicion. The landlady\'s husband had sworn that Susan left the\r\nhouse by herself. Then, where was the girl? The fugitive had been\r\ntracked to the railway, the policeman said; but she was alone. Nobody\r\nhad thought before of her helpless companion. The inspector arrived\r\nwhile they were going over the house trying if it were possible to find\r\nany traces of this forlorn creature. Vincent was much too profoundly\r\nconcerned himself to keep silence about the mysterious movements of the\r\nwoman whom he had seen on his way to Dover--whom he had seen that very\r\nmorning in the darkness--whom he knew to be the bitterest enemy of the\r\nmurdered man. It was only when he described her--when he tried to\r\ncollect all the information he had ever had about her for the guidance\r\nof justice--that he saw how little he knew of her in reality. His very\r\ndescription was tinged with a touch of fancy; and in this frightful\r\nemergency he perceived, for the first time, how much his imagination had\r\nsupplied of the interest he felt in this woman. When he had done all it\r\nwas possible to do to set the pursuer on her track, and gathered all he\r\ncould of the supposed proofs against Susan, he left the place where he\r\ncould do nothing further. He had to describe himself fully--to prove his\r\nidentity by a reference to the Dissenting minister of the place, and\r\nexplain whence he had come and whither he was going, before the officers\r\nin charge of the house, although conscious that they had no grounds for\r\ndetaining him, would let him go. But he was permitted to leave at last.\r\nWhile he waited for the next train to Carlingford, he questioned the\r\ncabman, who could give but a very faint and indistinct description of\r\nthe lady whom he had seen at the pier-gates, whose appearance had\r\nstopped Colonel Mildmay in the prosecution of his journey. She was\r\nstanding under a lamp, the man said: the gentleman might see her, but he\r\ndidn\'t think as she could see him; but dim as the vision was, this was\r\nanother little link in the chain of evidence. If it did but vindicate\r\nSusan--save her, not from the penalty, but from the very shadow and\r\nsuspicion of such a horror! It was this which filled the minister\'s\r\nmind with every sort of frightful apprehension. To have Susan\'s name\r\nexposed to such a horrible publicity--to have such a scene, such a crime\r\nanyhow connected with his sister--the idea shook Vincent\'s mind utterly,\r\nand almost disabled him from thought at all. And where was she, poor\r\nhorror-stricken fugitive? He scarcely dared hope that she had gone to\r\nher mother. Sudden death, madness, any misery, seemed possible to have\r\novertaken the unhappy girl thus suddenly reft out of the peacefulness of\r\nher youth into circumstances so horrible. When he entered Carlingford,\r\nlate at night, it was with insupportable pangs of suspense and alarm\r\nthat he looked into the faces he met on the lighted streets. Were they\r\nlooking at him already with a consciousness that some frightful shadow\r\nenveloped him? Tozer\'s shop was already shut--earlier than usual,\r\nsurely--and two or three people stood talking at the open door, clearly\r\nvisible against the gaslight, which still burned bright within. Farther\r\nup, opposite his own house, two or three passengers had stopped to look\r\nup at the lighted windows. When Vincent thrust aside a lad who happened\r\nto be in his way, asking, with uncontrollable irritation, what he wanted\r\nthere, the door opened suddenly at the sound of his voice. All was\r\nexcited and confused within--common life, with its quiet summonses and\r\nanswers, was over there. Wild confusion, agitation, reproach, surrounded\r\nthe unfortunate minister. His landlady came forward to meet him, to\r\nbewail her own misfortune, and upbraid him with the wrong he had done\r\nher. "I took in the pastor for a lodger, because he was sure to be\r\nsteady and respectable, and this is what he has brought to me!" cried\r\nthe hysterical woman. "What is the meaning of all this?" cried Vincent,\r\nlooking round him with restrained fury, but he did not wait for an\r\nanswer. He went up to his rooms to know the worst. As he rushed\r\nbreathless up-stairs, loud outcries of delirium reached him. In his\r\nhorror and anguish he could not recognise the voice--was it his mother\r\nwho had given way under the terrible burden? He dashed open the door of\r\nthe sitting-room in which he had spent so many quiet hours--neither\r\nmother nor sister were there; instead of them a rough-featured man, in a\r\nblue travelling-coat, and Tozer, flushed and argumentative, standing by\r\nthe table. Vincent had not time to ask what the controversy was that was\r\ngoing on between the two. The butterman grasped his hand with an almost\r\nviolent pressure, and took the stranger\'s arm. "Beg your pardon for\r\nbeing in your room, Mr. Vincent, but me and this gentleman has a little\r\nbusiness. I\'ll be back presently and explain," said the good deacon,\r\nwith a compassionate look at the young man, whose weary eyes sought with\r\ninstinctive suspicion that unknown face. "I\'m your friend, Mr.\r\nVincent-- I always was; I\'m not one as will desert a friend in trouble,"\r\nsaid Tozer, with another shake of his hand, lowering his voice. Then he\r\ndisappeared with his strange companion. The minister was alone with\r\nthose cries, with this agitation. He threw himself down in momentary\r\ndespair. The worst, it appeared, had happened--the horror had travelled\r\nbefore him. He gave up everything in the anguish of that moment. There\r\nseemed to be no use for any further struggle. To this sensitive,\r\nspotless, inexperienced household, suspicion was worse than death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Vincent came to himself, and began to see clearly the true horrors\r\nof his position, his mind, driven to its last stronghold, rallied\r\nconvulsively to meet the worst. It was Susan who was raving close by;\r\nbut her brother, in the sickening despair of his heart, had not the\r\ncourage to go into that agitated sick-room. He sat waiting for Tozer\'s\r\nreturn with a sense of helplessness, a sense of irritation, against\r\nwhich he had no strength to contend. In that bitter moment he gave up\r\neverything, and felt himself no longer capable of striving against his\r\nfate. He felt in his heart that all Carlingford must already be\r\ndiscussing the calamity that had come upon him, and that his innocent\r\nhonourable name was already sullied by the breath of the crowd; and,\r\nwith a strange mixture of intolerance and eagerness, he waited the\r\nreturn of the man who had first, as it appeared, thrust himself into the\r\nsecret--a man whom the minister must not affront, must not defy, on\r\nperil of all he had in the world. These few silent moments were more\r\nterrible to Vincent than any that had gone before them. Was it any good\r\nholding out, attempting to keep a brave face to the world, struggling\r\nagainst this crushing blow?--or would it not be easiest to give in, to\r\ndrop the useless arms, to fly from the inevitable downfall? Some corner\r\nof the earth there surely remained where he could hide his head and find\r\na shelter for the two poor women who were greater sufferers than he. It\r\nwas with such feelings that he awaited the return of Tozer--feelings\r\naggravated by the consciousness that somehow the butterman was engaged\r\nin his service at this very moment, and by a shadowy and unexpressed\r\nsuspicion in his mind as to the character of the stranger whom Tozer had\r\ntaken away. The excellent deacon returned at last with looks of\r\nconscious importance. He was very sorry and anxious, but he could not\r\nhelp looking confidential, and standing a little higher upon the ground\r\nof this mystery, which nobody shared but himself. Once more he shook\r\nhands with Vincent, sympathetically, and with a grasp full of meaning.\r\n\r\n"The thing for us to do is to keep it quiet--to keep it quiet, sir,"\r\nsaid Tozer, lowering his voice as he spoke. "Nothing must be said about\r\nit--no more nor can be helped, Mr. Vincent. As far as it has gone,\r\nthere\'s nobody as has heard but me. If it could be kept private from the\r\nSalem folks," continued the butterman, taking a seat at the table, and\r\nlooking cautiously round him, as if to make sure that no one was within\r\nhearing, "it would be for the best. Them women do make such a talk about\r\neverything. Not to tell a falsehood, sir, as I wouldn\'t, not to save my\r\nown, if so be as my own could be in such a position--we\'ll say as your\r\nsister\'s took bad, sir, that\'s what we\'ll say. And no lie neither--hear\r\nto her, poor soul!-- But, Mr. Vincent," said Tozer, drawing closer, and\r\nconfiding his doubt in a whisper, "what she says is best not to be\r\nlistened to, if you\'ll take my advice. It ain\'t to be built upon what a\r\npoor creature says in a fever, but them sort of words and screechings\r\ndon\'t come out of nothing but a troubled mind. She was aggravated\r\nawful--so the man tells me."\r\n\r\n"Who was the man?" asked Vincent, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"The man? oh!--which man was you meaning, sir?" asked Tozer, with a\r\nlittle fright, recurring to his more generous intention of keeping this\r\nintruder altogether from the knowledge of the minister; "nobody in\r\nparticular, Mr. Vincent--nobody as is worth mentioning. One as was sent\r\nto inquire--that\'s all. I\'ve cleared him away out of the road," said the\r\nbutterman, not without some natural complacency: "there ain\'t no matter\r\nabout him. Don\'t ask me no more, Mr. Vincent, for it\'s losing time as is\r\nprecious. If there\'s anything as can be done, it\'s best to do it\r\ndirectly. I\'d speak to John Brown as is the cleverest attorney in\r\nCarlingford, sir, if I was you. She\'s young, and, as I was saying, she\r\nwas aggravated awful. She might be got off."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Vincent, who had to put a desperate curb upon himself, lest\r\nthe restrained rage with which he heard this implication of guilt should\r\nburst out; "you think there is something in this horrible business--that\r\nmy sister has something to do with it. It is all a frightful\r\ndelusion--an infernal----"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent, sir, you mustn\'t swear. I\'m as sorry for you as a man can\r\nbe; but you\'re a minister, and you mustn\'t give way," said Tozer. "If\r\nthere ain\'t nothing in it, so much the better; but I\'m told as the\r\nevidence is clean again\' her. Well, I won\'t say no more; it\'s no\r\npleasure to me to think of a young creature, and a minister\'s daughter,\r\nwith a mother like what she\'s got, going any ways astray--far the\r\ncontrary, Mr. Vincent: your own father, if he was living, couldn\'t be\r\nmore sorry than me. But my advice is, keep quiet, and don\'t let anything\r\nget out no more nor can be helped. I don\'t mean to say as it can be\r\naltogether kep\' quiet--that ain\'t in the nature of things; nor I don\'t\r\nmean to make you suppose as all is likely to go smooth, and no fault\r\nfound. There\'s pretty sure to be some unpleasantness, one way or\r\nanother; and the only thing as I can see is just to put up with it, and\r\nstand your ground, and do your duty all the same. And I for one will\r\nstand by you, sir," said Tozer, rising to his feet with a little glow of\r\nconscious generosity and valour, and shaking the hand of the poor young\r\nminister with cordial kindness--"I\'ll stand by you, sir, for one,\r\nwhatever happens; and we\'ll tide it out, Mr. Vincent, that\'s what we\'ll\r\ndo, sir, if you can but hold on."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said poor Vincent, moved to the heart--"thank you. I dare\r\nnot think how it is all to end, but thank you all the same; I shall not\r\nforget what you say."\r\n\r\n"And tell your mother," continued Tozer, swelling to a little triumph in\r\nhis own magnanimity--"tell your mother as I said so; tell her as I\'ll\r\nstand by you through thick and thin; and we\'ll pull through, we\'ll pull\r\nthrough!" said the butterman, slowly disappearing, with a face radiant\r\nwith conscious bounty and patronage, through the open door.\r\n\r\nVincent had followed him with an instinct of civility and gratitude.\r\nJust as Tozer withdrew, a fresh burst of outcry came from the sick-room,\r\nringing through the excited house. The deacon turned round half-way down\r\nthe stair, held up his hands, listened, and made a movement of wondering\r\npity towards the closed door which hid Susan, but did not keep in her\r\ncries. The wretched minister drew back from that compassionate gesture\r\nas if some one had struck him a blow. He went back and threw himself\r\ndown on the sofa, and covered his face with his hands. The pity and the\r\npatronage were the last drop of humiliation in his bitter cup. Hot tears\r\ncame to his eyes; it seemed to him more than flesh and blood could bear.\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed, however, before Vincent had the courage to meet his\r\nmother. When those dreadful outcries sank into exhaustion, and all for\r\nthe moment was quiet in the sick-room, he sent to tell her he had\r\narrived, and went to the dreadful door which she kept closed so\r\njealously. He was afraid to meet her eye when she came to him, and\r\nnoiselessly drew him within. Judging by himself, he had not ventured to\r\nthink what his mother\'s horror and despair would be. But Mrs. Vincent\r\nput her arms round her son with an exclamation of thanksgiving. "Oh,\r\nArthur! thank God, you are come. Now I shall be able to bear it," cried\r\nhis mother. She cried a little upon his breast, and then wiped her eyes\r\nand looked up at him with quivering lips. "Oh, Arthur, what my poor\r\ndarling must have come through!" said Mrs. Vincent, with a wistful\r\nappeal to him in her tender eyes. She said nothing of the darker horror.\r\nIt lay upon her soul a frightful, inarticulate shadow; but in the mean\r\ntime she could only think of Susan and her fever--that fever which\r\nafforded a kind of comfort to the mother--a proof that her child had not\r\nlost her innocence lightly, but that the shock had been to Susan a\r\nhorrible convulsion, shaking earth and heaven. The mother and son went\r\ntogether to the bedside to look at the unhappy cause of all their\r\nsorrows--she clinging with her tender hand to his arm, wistful now, and\r\nafraid in the depths of her heart lest Arthur, who was only a man, might\r\nbe hard upon Susan in her terrible abasement. It was more than a year\r\nsince Vincent had seen his sister. Was it Susan? The grandeur of the\r\nstricken form, the features sublimed and elevated, the majestic\r\nproportions into which this awful crisis of fate had developed the\r\nfair-haired girl of Lonsdale, struck her brother with unspeakable awe\r\nand pity. Pity and awe: but yet another feeling mingled in the wonder\r\nwith which he gazed upon her. A thrill of terror came over him. That\r\nfrightful, tropical blaze of passion, anguish, and woe which had\r\nproduced this sudden development, had it developed no unknown qualities\r\nin Susan\'s heart? As she lay there in the majesty of unconsciousness,\r\nshe resembled more a woman who could avenge herself, than a soft girl,\r\nthe sudden victim of a bad man. Vincent turned away from the bed with an\r\ninvoluntary shudder. He would not, could not, look at her again: he left\r\nhis mother to her unceasing vigil, and himself went to his own room, to\r\ntry if rest were possible. Rest was not easy in such a terrible\r\ncomplication of affairs; but weariness is omnipotent with youth. He did\r\nsleep by snatches, in utter fatigue and exhaustion--slept long enough to\r\nsecure for himself the unspeakable torture of waking to the renewed\r\nhorror of a new day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEXT morning the minister rose to the changed life and world which now\r\nsurrounded his way, if not with much less excitement, at least with a\r\nmore familiar knowledge of all the troubles which encompassed him. As he\r\nsat over the pretended breakfast, for which he had no appetite, and not\r\neven heart enough to make a show of eating, hearing close by the voice\r\nof his sister\'s delirium, sometimes in faint murmurs, sometimes rising\r\ninto wild outcries of passion, and pondered all the circumstances of\r\nthis frightful calamity, it is not wonderful that his heart fainted\r\nwithin him. He had found out quickly enough that it was an officer of\r\njustice whom Tozer had succeeded, by what means he could not tell, in\r\nremoving from his house. His landlady knew all the facts sufficiently\r\nwell to be by times reproachful and by times sympathetic. The other\r\nlodgers in the house, some of whom had already left for fear of\r\npollution, were equally aware of all the circumstances of the case; and\r\nit was impossible to hope that a tale so exciting, known to so many,\r\ncould be long of spreading. The minister seemed to himself to look ruin\r\nin the face, as he sat in profound dejection, leaning his head in his\r\nhands. He had committed his sister\'s interests into the hands of the\r\nbest attorney he could hear of in Dover, that watch and search might be\r\nmade on the spot for any further information; and now the only thing\r\npossible to be done was to secure some still more skilful agent in\r\nLondon to superintend the case, and set all the machinery of detection\r\nin motion to discover Mrs. Hilyard. Vincent had nothing in the world but\r\nthe income which he drew from the liberality of Salem; an income which\r\ncould ill stand the drain of these oft-repeated journeys, not to speak\r\nof the expenses of Susan\'s defence. All that the minister had would not\r\nbe enough to retain a fit defender for her, if she had to undergo the\r\nfrightful ordeal of a trial. The very thought of it drove her unhappy\r\nbrother desperate. Would it not be better if she died and escaped that\r\ncrowning misery, which must kill her anyhow, if she survived to bear it?\r\nBut these ponderings were as unprofitable as they were painful. When he\r\nhad seen his mother, who whispered to him accounts of Susan\'s illness,\r\nwhich his mind was too much preoccupied to understand, he went away\r\nimmediately to the railway, and hastened to town. While he stood waiting\r\nin the lawyer\'s office, he took up listlessly, without knowing what he\r\nwas doing, the newspaper of the day. There he found the whole terrible\r\ntale made into a romance of real life, in which his sister\'s name,\r\nindeed, was withheld, but no other particular spared. As he stood wiping\r\nthe heavy dew from his forehead, half frantic with rage and despair, the\r\nquick eye of his misery caught a couple of clerks in another corner of\r\nthe office, talking over another newspaper, full of lively interest and\r\nexcitement. It was Susan\'s story that interested them; the compiler had\r\nheightened with romantic details those hideous bare facts which had\r\nchanged all his life, and made the entire world a chaos to Vincent; and\r\nall over the country by this time, newspaper readers were waking up into\r\nexcitement about this new tale of love, revenge, and crime. The poor\r\nminister put down the paper as if it had stung him, and drew back,\r\ntingling in every nerve, from the table, where he could almost hear the\r\ndiscussion which was going on about Miss----; where she could have\r\nescaped to, and whether she would be found. It restored him to his\r\nsenses and self-command when he found himself face to face with the cool\r\nlawyer, who waited for his tragic story as a matter of business, and who\r\nhad nothing to do with the heartbreaks or the disgrace which it\r\ninvolved. He was detained there for some time, giving as full an account\r\nas he could of all the circumstances, and describing as well as he could\r\nhis reasons for suspecting Mrs. Hilyard, and her mysterious appearance\r\nat the scene of the murder. Vincent perceived, with a sensation of\r\ncomfort at his heart, that his story interested the acute attorney,\r\naccustomed to the tricks and expedients of crime, who perceived at once\r\nthe circumstances of suspicion, and understood at once how to go about\r\nit, and ferret the secret out. The minister himself grew steadier as he\r\nentered into his narrative. No shivers of wonder or pain convulsed the\r\ncalm lawyer as he listened. Under his touch, Susan\'s dreadful position\r\nbecame one not unprecedented, to be dealt with like any other condition\r\nof actual life; and when Vincent, after furnishing all the information\r\nhe could, and satisfying himself that no time was to be lost in the\r\nprosecution of the search for the real criminal, left the office to\r\nreturn to Carlingford, it was with a mind somewhat calmed out of its\r\nfirst horror. He went back again by the train, deeply depressed and\r\nanxious, but not so susceptible to every glance and word as he had been\r\nan hour or two before. He tried, indeed, to take a certain gloomy\r\nsatisfaction from the idea that now everything was known. Fear of\r\ndiscovery could no longer appal the stricken household; and to meet the\r\nhorror in the face was less dreadful than to feel themselves skulking\r\nunder a secret shadow which might at any moment be found out. He set his\r\nface sternly, and looked everybody full in the eyes who looked at him,\r\nas he once more alighted at the familiar station. He accepted the fact\r\nthat people were talking of him, pitying him, contemplating him with\r\nwonder and fright, as somehow involved in an atmosphere of tragedy and\r\ncrime. With this feeling he went slowly along George Street on his\r\nhomeward way, with no susceptibility left in him, so far as he was\r\naware, except as concerned this sudden calamity which had swallowed up\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nWhen suddenly the sound of a carriage stopping came dully upon his ears;\r\nhe would not have noted or heard it but for the sound that followed of\r\nsome one calling his own name, and the soft rush of footsteps on the\r\npavement; even then he did not turn round to see who called him. It was\r\naccordingly with a thrill of strange emotion--a strange, sudden, guilty\r\nsuffusion of delight over all his tingling frame and aching heart, even\r\nin the midst of his suffering, that he felt the light touch of Lady\r\nWestern\'s hand first laid on his arm, then softly stealing within it in\r\nthe sudden sympathy which possessed her as she looked up into his\r\ncolourless face. It was pity and natural kindness which prompted the\r\nyoung Dowager to this unwonted familiar touch. She was sorry for him to\r\nthe bottom of her heart--she would fain have made him amends somehow for\r\nthe terrible evil which had come upon him. With the natural impulse of a\r\nwoman to caress or soothe, or cheat a man anyhow out of that look of\r\nsuffering which it is intolerable to her to see on his face, Lady\r\nWestern acted instinctively, without thinking what she did. She did her\r\nbeautiful hand into his arm, clung to him, looked up with her lovely\r\nappealing face and eyes full of tears to the pale face of the minister,\r\nwhich that touch moved beyond all expression. If he did not stop and\r\ntake her into his arms, and lean his great anguish upon her in a\r\nsweetness of relief unspeakable and measureless, it was only because\r\nordinary rule and custom are stronger than even passion. He was as much\r\ndeceived as if he had done it, the poor young deluded soul. Out of the\r\nthunder and storm, all at once, without prelude or warning, he thought\r\nit was the light of love that broke upon him all radiant and glorious.\r\nWith that he could brave all, overcome all; for that he could be content\r\nto fathom any depths of wretchedness. So he thought, as he looked down\r\nfrom those sudden heights of unhoped-for tremulous blessedness into that\r\nlovely face, and saw it trembling with divine compassion and tenderness.\r\nSo he thought the ice breaking, the depths stirring in his own soul.\r\nHope, deliverance, happiness, a delight more exquisite still, that\r\nconsolation of love which makes anguish itself sweet, breathed over the\r\npoor young Nonconformist as that hand slid within his arm. His very\r\nbrain grew dizzy with the sweetness of relief, the sudden ease that\r\npossessed his soul.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Vincent, my heart is breaking; what shall we do--what shall we\r\ndo?" cried Lady Western. "If it is true, I shall never dare speak to you\r\nagain, and I feel for you to the bottom of my heart. Oh, Mr. Vincent,\r\nyou don\'t think she did it? I am sure she did not do it--your sister! It\r\nwas bad enough before," cried the lovely creature, crying without\r\nrestraint, but still holding his arm and gazing up into his face, "but\r\nnow my heart is broken. Oh, will you tell me what I must do? I will not\r\ngo to him, for he has been a bad man; and I dare not go to your dear\r\nmother as I should like to go; and I feel for you, oh, to the very\r\nbottom of my heart!"\r\n\r\n"Then I can bear it," said Vincent. Though he did not speak another\r\nword, the sound of his voice, the expression of his face, betrayed him.\r\nHe put his hand involuntarily upon the little hand that rested on his\r\narm. It was all so sudden that his self-command forsook him. A smile\r\ntrembled upon his face as he looked down at her with all his heart in\r\nhis eyes. "Then I can bear it," said the poor young minister,\r\noverwhelmed and penetrated by that exquisite consolation. Lady Western\r\ngave a little start of alarm as she read the unmistakable meaning in his\r\nface. She withdrew her hand hastily with a flush of radiant colour and\r\ndowncast look of fright and shame. What had she done? Her confusion, her\r\nagitation, her sudden withdrawal, did but increase the spell. To\r\nVincent\'s charmed soul it seemed that she had betrayed herself, and that\r\nwomanly reserve alone drew her back. He attended her to her carriage\r\nwith a tender devotion which could not express itself in words. When he\r\nhad put her in, he lingered, gazing at the face, now so troubled and\r\ndowncast, with a delicious feeling that he had a right to gaze at her.\r\n"You have made me strong to bear all things," he said, in the low tone\r\nof passion and secret joy. In the depth of his delusion he saw no other\r\nmeaning than sudden timidity and womanly reticence in her confused and\r\nalarmed looks. When the carriage drove off he stood looking after it\r\nwith eyes full of dreamy light. Darkness surrounded him on every side,\r\ndarkness more hideous than a nightmare. The poor young soul believed for\r\nthat delicious moment that superlative and ineffable, like his misery,\r\nwas to be his joy.\r\n\r\nHarder thoughts regained the mastery when he got within his own house\r\nagain. It was no longer the orderly, calm, well-regulated house which\r\nhad taken in the minister of Salem by way of adding yet a finer touch to\r\nits own profound respectability. Susan\'s unhappy presence pervaded the\r\nplace. Boxes of other lodgers going away encumbered the hall, where the\r\nlandlady hovered weeping, and admitted the pastor sullenly with an\r\naudible sob.\r\n\r\nThough he had imagined himself invested in armour of light against all\r\nthese petty assaults, Vincent was not strong enough, even in the\r\nfictitious strength given him by Lady Western\'s kindness, to bear the\r\nreality of his position. The very face of his landlady brought before\r\nhim the whole array of faces at Salem, which he must shortly encounter,\r\nall directed towards him in judicial severity--an awful tribunal. When\r\nhe reached the shelter of his room up-stairs, the \'Carlingford Gazette\'\r\nlay upon his table, folded out so as to show that mysterious story of\r\nMiss----, which some one in the house had certainly identified. The poor\r\nminister took it in his hands with an impulse to tear it in pieces--to\r\ntrample it under foot--to give some outlet, now he was by himself, to\r\nthe rage and indignation with which he saw his own calamity turned into\r\na romance for the amusement of the public. He checked himself with a\r\nbitter smile at his own folly; unconsciously he bethought himself of\r\nTozer\'s back-parlour, of Mr. Tufton\'s sitting-room, of all the places\r\nabout where he had seen his people gleaning information and amusement\r\nfrom the \'Carlingford Gazette.\' How the little paper, generally so\r\nharmless, would amuse and excite its readers to-day! What surmises there\r\nwould be, and how soon the fatal knowledge would ooze out and be talked\r\nover on all sides! It was no matter of feeling to him--it was ruin in\r\nevery way to the poor young minister, whose credit and living depended\r\nsolely upon the caprice of his "flock." The sight of the newspaper had\r\nso stunned him, that it was some time before he perceived a letter lying\r\nunder it on the table. When he saw that the post-mark was Dover, he\r\nsnatched up this letter eagerly and tore it open. It was from the\r\nlawyer whom he had consulted there. For the first moment he did not\r\ncomprehend the information it conveyed. Good news!--what news could be\r\ngood under his dreadful circumstances? The young man\'s mind was\r\nstupified, and could not take it in. It was the copy of a doctor\'s\r\ncertificate--the opinion of a famous surgeon who had been summoned from\r\nLondon--to the effect that Colonel Mildmay\'s wound was not necessarily\r\nfatal, and that if fever did not come on he might recover. The minister\r\nread it over again and again before he could comprehend it, and when he\r\ndid comprehend it, the fact seemed rather an aggravation than a comfort\r\nto his misery. He was not dead--this destroyer. Perhaps at this moment,\r\nwhen his unhappy victim lay struggling between life and death, he, with\r\nthe horrible good fortune of wickedness, was coming back from the edge\r\nof the grave. At the first shock it did not seem good news to Vincent.\r\nNot dead!--"the cursed villain," he said through his clenched teeth. The\r\nearth was not rid of that pitiless wretch. It looked like another grand\r\ninjustice in the world, where all the landmarks were overturned, and\r\nonly evil seemed to prosper. He did not connect it anyhow with possible\r\nrelief or deliverance to Susan; on the contrary, it raised in his own\r\nmind all the resentment and rage which had been quenched by Mildmay\'s\r\nsupposed death. He could scarcely compose himself after that unexpected\r\ninformation. If all went well, it would naturally change the character\r\nof the case--perhaps, under the circumstances, there might be no\r\nprosecution, said the lawyer\'s letter. Vincent was young--excited out\r\nof all self-command or prudential considerations. In his soul he\r\nresented even this hope, which might still save his sister, and grudged\r\nwhat he felt to be the diabolical good-luck of her destroyer. Not\r\ndead!--not going to die!--not punished anyhow. About, after all the\r\nmisery he had occasioned, to recover, and go on prosperously again, and\r\nspread wretchedness and ruin upon others. "He shall render me an\r\naccount," cried the minister fiercely to himself. "He shall answer for\r\nit to me!" He felt it intolerable, that this guilty soul should escape\r\nits punishment.\r\n\r\nThoughts more reasonable, however, came to him after a time. He began to\r\nsee the importance of the intelligence to Susan--and even to himself. At\r\nleast she could not be accused of shedding blood--at least she might be\r\nhidden somewhere in her shame, poor lost soul, and kept from the cruel\r\neyes of the world. When he began to feel the influence of this gleam of\r\ncomfort, he ventured to go to the sick-room to tell his mother, whom he\r\nhad not yet seen; but Mrs. Vincent was deaf and insensible to everything\r\nbut her child, whose need and danger were too urgent to permit more\r\ndistant spectres, however terrible, to be visible in her sick-chamber.\r\nMary, already worn out with fatigue, had gone to bed with a headache,\r\nwith the liveliest conviction in her mind that she had taken the fever\r\ntoo. The widow, who had lived for the past week as though she had no\r\nphysical frame at all, sat sleepless, with hot eyes and pallid face, by\r\nher daughter\'s bed. She could still smile--smiles more heart-breaking\r\nthan any outcry of anguish--and leaned her poor head upon her son, as\r\nhe came near to her, with a tender pressure of her arms and strain of\r\nabsolute dependence which went to his heart. She could not speak, or\r\nsay, as she had said so often, that her boy must take care of his\r\nsister--that Susan had no one else to stand by her. Leaning upon him in\r\nan unspeakable appeal of love and weakness, smiling on him with her\r\nwistful quivering lips, was all the poor mother could do now.\r\n\r\nAll; for in that room no one could speak. One voice filled its silence.\r\nThe restless movement of the head on that pillow turning from side to\r\nside in search of the rest which was nowhere to be found, stilled every\r\nother motion. Not even fever could flush the marble whiteness of her\r\nface. Awfully alone, in her mother\'s anxious presence, with her brother\r\nby her bedside, Susan went on unconscious through the wild distracted\r\nworld of her own thoughts--through what had been her own thoughts before\r\nhorror and anguish cast them all astray. Vincent stood aside in\r\nbreathless attention like the rest, before he had been many minutes in\r\nthe room. We say to each other how strange it is that no heart can ever\r\nfully communicate itself to another; but when that revelation does take\r\nplace, awful is the spectacle. All unawares, in her dread distraction,\r\nSusan opened up her heart.\r\n\r\n"What does it matter what they will say?" said Susan; "I will never see\r\nthem again. Unless--yes, put down her veil; she is pretty, very pretty;\r\nbut what has Herbert to do with her? He said it was me he wanted; and\r\nwhy did he bring me away if he did not love me? Love me! and deceived\r\nme, and told me lies. Oh God, oh God! is it not Carlingford? Where is\r\nit? I am taking God\'s name in vain. I was not thinking of Him--, I was\r\nthinking----. His name is Fordham, Herbert Fordham,--do you hear? What\r\ndo you mean by Mildmay? I know no Mildmay. Stop and let me think.\r\nHerbert--Herbert! Oh, where are you--where are you? Do you think it\r\nnever could be him, but only a lie? Well! if he did not love me, I could\r\nbear it; but why, why did he cheat me, and bring me away? The door is\r\nlocked; they will not let me get out. Herbert! was there never, never\r\nany Herbert in the world? Oh, come back, even if you are only a dream!\r\nLocked! If they would only kill me! What do they mean to do with me? Oh\r\nGod, oh God! but I must marry him if he says so. I must, must marry him,\r\nthough he has told me lies. I must, whatever he does. Even if I could\r\nget through the window and escape; for they will call me wicked. Oh,\r\nmamma, mamma! and Arthur a minister, and to bring disgrace on him! But I\r\nam not disgraced. Oh no, no; never, never!-- I will die first-- I will\r\nkill him first. Open the door; oh, open the door! Let me go!"\r\n\r\nShe struggled up in one of her wilder paroxysms. She had thrown herself\r\nhalf out of bed, rising up wildly, and tossing her arms into the air,\r\nbefore her startled brother could rush forward to control her. But as\r\nthe voice of the unhappy girl rose into frenzy, some unseen attendants\r\nstole in and took her out of his unskilful hands. The sight was too\r\npainful for unaccustomed eyes--for eyes of love, which could scarcely\r\nbear, even for her own sake, to see such means of restraint employed\r\nupon Susan. Mrs. Vincent stood by, uttering unconscious cries, imploring\r\nthe two strong women who held her daughter, oh, not to hurt her, not to\r\ngrasp her so tightly; while Susan herself beat the air in vain, and\r\nentreated, with passionate outcries, to be set free--to be let go. When\r\nshe was again subdued, and sank into the quiet of exhaustion, Vincent\r\nwithdrew from this saddest scene of all, utterly depressed and\r\nbroken-spirited. The wretch lived who had wrought this dread wreck and\r\nruin. What did it matter? Within that room it gave no relief, eased no\r\nheart, to say that he was not dead. Forms more terrific still than those\r\nof law and public vengeance--madness and death--stood on either side of\r\nSusan\'s bed; till they had fought out the desperate quarrel, what matter\r\nto those most immediately concerned whether a greater or a lesser\r\npenalty lowered over her head? The minister went back to his own\r\nretirement with an aching heart, utterly dejected and depressed. He\r\nthrew himself into a chair to think it all over, as he said to himself;\r\nbut as he sat there, hopeless and solitary, his mind strayed from Susan.\r\nCould any one blame him? Who does not know what it is to have one secret\r\nspot of personal consolation to fly to in the midst of trouble? Vincent\r\nbetook himself there in the utter darkness of everything around. Once\r\nmore he seemed to feel that sudden touch which took away half his\r\nburden. No words could have spoken to his heart like that fairy hand\r\nupon his arm. He brooded over it, not thinking, only living over again\r\nthe moment which had made so great a difference in the world. He forgot\r\nFordham; he forgot everything; he took neither reason nor likelihood\r\nwith him in his self-delusion. A sudden rosy mist suffused once more the\r\ncruel earth upon which he was standing; whatever came, he had something\r\nof his own to fall back upon, an ineffable secret sweetness, which\r\nstanched every wound before it was made. The young minister, out of the\r\nvery depths of calamity, escaped into this garden of delights; he put\r\naside the intolerable misery of the house; he thrust away from him all\r\nthe lesser troubles which bristled thick in front of him in the very\r\nname of Salem. He fled to that one spot of joy which he thought remained\r\nto him in the middle of the waste, doubly sweet and precious. It gave\r\nhim strength to hold out through his trouble, without being overwhelmed.\r\nHe escaped to that delicious resting-place almost against his will, not\r\nable to resist the charm of the indescribable solace he found there. He\r\nalone, of all concerned, had that footbreadth of personal happiness to\r\ntake refuge in amid the bitter storm. He did not know it was all\r\ndelusion, self-deception, a woeful miserable blunder. He hugged it to\r\nhis heart in secret, and took a comfort not to be spoken from the\r\nthought. Vanity of vanities; but nothing else in the world could have\r\nstolen with such fairy balms of consolation and strength to the heart of\r\nthe poor minister. It was not long till he was called to face his fate\r\nagain, and all the heavy front of battle set in array against him; but\r\nit was with a feeling of sweet guilt that he started up in the winter\r\ntwilight, and left his room to see Tozer, who waited for him below. That\r\nroom henceforward was inhabited by the fairy vision. When he went back\r\nto it, Love, the consolatrix, met him again, stealing that visionary\r\nhand within his arm. Blank darkness dwelt all around; here, falsest,\r\nfairest mirage of imagination, palpitated one delicious gleam of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMEHOW the heavy week stole round without any other fluctuations but\r\nthose terrible ones of Susan\'s fever. Dreadful consolation and terrible\r\ndoubt breathed forth in those heartrending revelations which her poor\r\nunconscious soul was continually pouring forth. The unhappy girl showed\r\nher heart all naked and undisguised to the watchers round her--a heart\r\nbewildered, alarmed, desperate, but not overwhelmed with guilty passion.\r\nThrough the dreadful haze which enveloped her mind, flashes of\r\nindignation, bursts of hope, shone tragical and fierce; but she was not\r\na disgraced creature who lay there, arguing pitifully with herself what\r\nshe must do; not disgraced--but in an agony of self-preservation could\r\nshe have snatched up the ready pistol--could it be true? When Vincent\r\nwent into that room, it was always to withdraw with a shuddering dread.\r\nHad she escaped one horror to fall into another yet more horrible? That\r\nevidence of which, with Mrs. Hilyard\'s face before his eyes, he had been\r\nhalf contemptuous at first, returned upon him with ever-growing\r\nprobability. Driven to bay, driven mad, reason and self-control scared\r\nby the horrible emergency, had the desperate creature resorted to the\r\nfirst wild expedient within her reach to save herself at last? With\r\nthis hideous likelihood growing in his mind, Vincent had to face the\r\nSunday, which came upon him like a new calamity. He would fain have\r\nwithdrawn, and, regardless of anything else which might happen, have\r\nsent once more for Beecher. To confront the people of Salem, to look\r\ndown upon those familiar rows of faces, all of them bearing a\r\nconsciousness of the story in the newspapers, acquainted with all that\r\nhis landlady could tell, and guessing but too distinctly the terrible\r\nmisfortune which had befallen his family, seemed more than flesh and\r\nblood could bear. He was sitting alone, pondering all this, with a\r\nletter which he had commenced to write to Beecher before him, when\r\nTozer, who was now his constant visitor, came in. There could be no\r\ndoubt of the butterman\'s honest and genuine sympathy, but,\r\nunfortunately, there was just as little doubt that Tozer took a pleasure\r\nin managing the minister\'s affairs at this crisis, and piloting him\r\nthrough the troubled waters. Tozer did all but neglect his business to\r\nmeet the emergency; he carried matters with rather a high hand in the\r\nmeetings of the managing committee; he took absolute control, or wished\r\nto do so, of Vincent\'s proceedings. "We\'ll tide it over, we\'ll tide it\r\nover," he said, rubbing his hands. To go in, in this state of mind,\r\nsecure in his own resources and in the skill with which he could guide\r\nthe wavering and half-informed mind of Salem, fluctuating as it did\r\nbetween horror and sympathy, doubtful whether to take up the minister\'s\r\ncause with zeal, or to cast him off and disown him, and to find the\r\nminister himself giving in, deserting his post at the most critical\r\nmoment, and making useless all that his patron was doing for him, was\r\ntoo much for the deacon\'s patience. He sat down in indignant surprise\r\nopposite Vincent, and struck his stick against the floor involuntarily,\r\nby way of emphasis to his words.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent, sir, this ain\'t the thing to do-- I tell you it ain\'t the\r\nthing to do. Salem has a right to expect different," cried Tozer, in the\r\nwarmth of his disappointment; "a congregation as has never said a word,\r\nand office-bearers as have stuck by you and stood up for you whatever\r\nfolks liked to say! I\'m a man as will never desert my pastor in trouble;\r\nbut I\'d like to know what you call this, Mr. Vincent, but a deserting of\r\nme? What\'s the good of fighting for the minister, if he gives in and\r\nsends for another man, and won\'t face nothing for himself? It\'s next\r\nSunday as is all the battle. Get that over, and things will come\r\nstraight. When they see you in the pulpit in your old way, and all\r\nthings as they was, bless you, they\'ll get used to it, and won\'t mind\r\nthe papers no more nor--nor I do. I tell you, sir, it\'s next Sunday as\r\nis the battle. I don\'t undertake to answer for the consequences, not if\r\nyou gives in, and has Mr. Beecher down for next Sunday. It ain\'t the\r\nthing to do, Mr. Vincent; Salem folks won\'t put up with that. Your good\r\nmother, poor thing, wouldn\'t say no different. If you mean to stay and\r\nkeep things straight in Carlingford, you\'ll go into that pulpit, and\r\nlook as if nothing had happened. It\'s next Sunday as is the battle."\r\n\r\n"Look as if nothing had happened!--and why should I wish to stay in\r\nCarlingford, or--or anywhere?" cried Vincent, in a momentary outbreak of\r\ndejection. But he threw down his pen, and closed his blotting-book over\r\nthe half-written letter. He was too wretched to have much resolution one\r\nway or another. To argue the matter was worse than to suffer any\r\nconsequences, however hard they might be.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t deny it\'s natural as you should feel strange," admitted Tozer.\r\n"I do myself, as am only your friend, Mr. Vincent, when folks are\r\na-talking in the shop, and going over one thing and another--asking if\r\nit\'s true as she belongs to you, and how a minister\'s daughter ever come\r\nto know the likes of him----"\r\n\r\n"For heaven\'s sake, no more, no more!--you will drive me mad!" cried\r\nVincent, springing to his feet. Tozer, thus suddenly interrupted, stared\r\na little, and then changed the subject, though without quite finding out\r\nhow it was that he had startled his sensitive companion into such sudden\r\nimpatience. "When I was only telling him the common talk!" as he said to\r\nhis wife in the privacy of their own parlour. In the mean time he had\r\nother subjects equally interesting.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll take my advice, you\'ll begin your coorse all the same," said\r\nTozer; "it would have a good effect, that would. When folks are in a\r\nstate of excitement, and a-looking for something, to come down upon them\r\nas before, and accordin\' to intimation, would have a wonderful effect,\r\nMr. Vincent. You take my word, sir, it would be very telling--would\r\nthat. Don\'t lose no time, but begin your coorse as was intimated. It\'s\r\na providence, is the intimation. I wouldn\'t say nothing about what\'s\r\nhappened--not plain out; but if you could bring in a kind of an\r\ninference like, nothing as had anything to do with the story in the\r\npapers, but just as might be understood----"\r\n\r\nThe butterman sat quite calmly and at his ease, but really anxious and\r\ninterested, making his sober suggestions. The unfortunate minister,\r\nunable otherwise to subdue his impatience and wretchedness, fell to\r\nwalking up and down the room, as was natural. When he could bear it no\r\nlonger, he came back to the table at which Tozer sat in all the pomp of\r\nadvice and management. He took his unfinished letter and tore it in\r\nlittle pieces, then stopped the calm flow of the deacon\'s counsel by a\r\nsudden outburst.\r\n\r\n"I will preach," cried the young man, scattering the bits of paper out\r\nof his hand unawares. "Is not that enough? don\'t tell me what I am to\r\ndo--the evil is sufficient without that. I tell you I will preach. I\r\nwould rather cut off my right hand, if that would do as well. I am\r\nspeaking like a child or a fool: who cares for my right hand, I wonder,\r\nor my life, or my senses? No more of this. I will preach--don\'t speak of\r\nit again. It will not matter a hundred years hence," muttered the\r\nminister, with that sudden adoption of the philosophy of recklessness\r\nwhich misery sometimes plays with. He threw himself into his chair\r\nagain, and covered his face with his hands. He was thinking of Salem,\r\nand all those rows of gazing eyes. He could see them all in their pews,\r\nimagination, with a cruel freak like a mocking spirit, depicting all\r\nthe finery of Mrs. Pigeon and Mrs. Brown upon that vivid canvass. The\r\nminister groaned at the thought of them; but to put it down on paper,\r\nand record the pang of exasperation and intolerable wretchedness which\r\nwas thus connected with the fine winter bonnets of the poulterer\'s wife\r\nand the dairy-woman would make a picture rather grotesque than terrible\r\nto unconcerned eyes. It was dreadful earnest to poor Vincent, thinking\r\nhow he should stand before them on that inexorable Sunday, and preach\r\n"as if nothing had happened;" reading all the while, in case his own\r\nmind would let him forget them, the vulgarest horrors of all that had\r\nhappened in all that crowd of eyes.\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll find a great consolation, take my word, sir, in the thought\r\nthat you\'re a-doing of your duty," said Tozer, shaking his head\r\nsolemnly, as he rose to go away; "that\'s a wonderful consolation, Mr.\r\nVincent, to all of us; and especially to a minister that knows he\'s\r\na-serving his Master and saving souls."\r\n\r\nSaving souls! Heaven help him! the words rang in his ears like mocking\r\nechoes long after the butterman had settled into his arm-chair, and\r\nconfided to his wife and Phoebe that the pastor was a-coming to\r\nhimself and taking to his duties, and that we\'ll tide it over yet.\r\n"Saving souls!" the words came back and back to Vincent\'s bewildered\r\nmind. They formed a measure and cadence in their constant repetition,\r\nhaunting him like some spiritual suggestion, as he looked over, with\r\nsenses confused and dizzy, his little stock of sermons, to make\r\npreparation for the duty which he could not escape. At last he tossed\r\nthem all away in a heap, seized his pen, and poured forth his heart.\r\nSaving souls! what did it mean? He was not writing a sermon. Out of the\r\ndepths of his troubled heart poured all the chaos of thought and wonder,\r\nwhich leapt into fiery life under that quickening touch of personal\r\nmisery and unrest. He forgot the bounds of orthodox speculation--all\r\nbounds save those of the drear mortal curtain of death, on the other\r\nside of which that great question is solved. He set forth the dark\r\nsecrets of life with exaggerated touches of his own passion and anguish.\r\nHe painted out of his own aching fancy a soul innocent, yet stained with\r\nthe heaviest of mortal crimes: he turned his wild light aside and poured\r\nit upon another, foul to the core, yet unassailable by man. Saving\r\nsouls!--which was the criminal? which was the innocent? A wild\r\nconfusion of sin and sorrow, of dreadful human complications,\r\nmisconceptions, of all incomprehensible, intolerable thoughts, surged\r\nround and round him as he wrote. Were the words folly that haunted him\r\nwith such echoes? Could he, and such as he, unwitting of half the\r\nmysteries of life, do anything to that prodigious work? Could words help\r\nit--vain syllables of exhortation or appeal? God knows. The end of it\r\nall was a confused recognition of the One half-known, half-identified,\r\nwho, if any hope were to be had, held that hope in His hands. The\r\npreacher, who had but dim acquaintance with His name, paused, in the\r\nhalf idiocy of his awakened genius, to wonder, like a child, if perhaps\r\nhis simple mother knew a little more of that far-off wondrous\r\nfigure--recognised it wildly by the confused lights as the only hope in\r\nearth or heaven--and so rose up, trembling with excitement and\r\nexhaustion, to find that he had spent the entire night in this sudden\r\ninspiration, and that the wintry dawn, cold and piercing to the heart,\r\nwas stealing over the opposite roofs, and another day had begun.\r\n\r\nThis was the sermon which startled half the population of Carlingford on\r\nthat wonderful Sunday. Salem, had never been so full before. Every\r\nindividual of the Chapel folks was there who could by any means come\r\nout, and many other curious inhabitants, full of natural wonder, to see\r\nhow a man looked, and what he would preach about, concerning whom, and\r\nwhose family, such mysterious rumours were afloat. The wondering\r\ncongregation thrilled like one soul under that touch of passion. Faces\r\ngrew pale, long sobs of emotion burst here and there from the\r\nhalf-terrified excited audience, who seemed to see around them, instead\r\nof the every-day familiar world, a throng of those souls whom the\r\npreacher disrobed of everything but passion and consciousness and\r\nimmortality. Just before the conclusion, when he came to a sudden pause\r\nall at once, and made a movement forward as if to lay hold of something\r\nhe saw, the effect was almost greater than the deacons could approve of\r\nin chapel. One woman screamed aloud, another fainted, some people\r\nstarted to their feet--all waited with suspended breath for the next\r\nwords, electrified by the real life which palpitated there before them,\r\nwhere life so seldom appears, in the decorous pulpit. When he went on\r\nagain the people were almost too much excited to perceive the plain\r\nmeaning of his words, if any plain meaning had ever been in that\r\npassionate outcry of a wounded and bewildered soul. When the services\r\nwere over, many of them watched the precipitate rush which the young\r\npreacher made through the crowd into his vestry. He could not wait the\r\ndispersion of the flock, as was the usual custom. It was with a buzz of\r\nexcitement that the congregation did disperse slowly, in groups, asking\r\neach other had such a sermon ever been preached before in Carlingford.\r\nSome shook their heads, audibly expressing their alarm lest Mr. Vincent\r\nshould go too far, and unsettle his mind; some pitied and commented on\r\nhis looks--women these. He sent them all away in a flutter of\r\nexcitement, which obliterated all other objects of talk for the moment,\r\neven the story in the papers, and left himself in a gloomy splendour of\r\neloquence and uncertainty, the only object of possible comment until the\r\nfumes of his wild oration should have died away.\r\n\r\n"I said we\'d tide it over," said Tozer, in a triumphant whisper, to his\r\nwife. "That\'s what he can do when he\'s well kep\' up to it, and put on\r\nhis mettle. The man as says he ever heard anything as was finer, or had\r\nmore mind in it," added the worthy butterman to his fellow-deacons, "has\r\nhad more opportunities nor me; and though I say it, I\'ve heard the best\r\npreachers in our connection. That\'s philosophical, that is--there ain\'t\r\na man in the Church as I ever heard of as could match that, and not a\r\nmany as comes out o\' \'Omerton. We\'re not a-going to quarrel with a\r\npastor as can preach a sermon like that, not because he\'s had a\r\nmisfortune in his family. Come into the vestry, Pigeon, and say a kind\r\nword--as you\'re sorry, and we\'ll stand by him. He wants to be kep\' up,\r\nthat\'s what he wants. Mind like that always does. It ain\'t equal to\r\ndoing for itself, like most. Come along with me, and say what\'s kind,\r\nand cheer him up, as has exerted hisself and done his best."\r\n\r\n"It was rousing up," said Pigeon, with a little reluctance; "even the\r\nmissis didn\'t go again\' that; but where he\'s weak is in the application.\r\nI don\'t mind just shaking hands----"\r\n\r\n"If we was all to go, he might take it kind," suggested Brown, the\r\ndairyman, who had little to say, and not much confidence in his own\r\nopinion; and pride and kindness combined won the day. The deacons who\r\nwere in attendance went in, in a body, to shake hands with the pastor,\r\nand express their sympathy, and congratulate him on his sermon, the\r\nlatter particular being an established point of deacon\'s duty in every\r\nwell-regulated and harmonious community. They went in rather pleased\r\nwith themselves, and full of the gratification they were about to\r\nconfer. But the open door of the vestry revealed an empty room, with the\r\npreacher\'s black gown lying tossed upon the floor, as if it had been\r\nthrown down recklessly in his sudden exit. The little procession came to\r\na halt, and stared in each other\'s faces. Their futile good intentions\r\nflashed into exasperation. They had come to bestow their favour upon\r\nhim, to make him happy, and behold he had fled in contemptuous haste,\r\nwithout waiting for their approval; even Tozer felt the shock of the\r\nfailure. So far as the oligarchs of Salem were concerned, the sermon\r\nmight never have been preached, and the pastor sank deeper than ever\r\ninto the bad opinion of Mr. Pigeon and Mr. Brown.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Vincent had rushed from his pulpit, thrown on his coat,\r\nand rushed out again into the cold mid-day, tingling in every limb with\r\nthe desperate effort of self-restraint, which alone had enabled him to\r\npreserve the gravity of the pulpit and conclude the services with due\r\nsteadiness and propriety. When he made that sudden pause, it was not for\r\nnought. Effective though it was, it was no trick of oratory which caught\r\nthe breath at his lips, and transfixed him for the moment. There, among\r\nthe crowded pews of Salem, deep in the further end of the chapel, half\r\nlost in the throng of listeners, suddenly, all at once, had flashed upon\r\nhim a face--a face, unchanged from its old expression, intent as if no\r\ndeluge had descended, no earthquake fallen; listening, as of old, with\r\ngleaming keen eyes and close-shut emphatic mouth. The whole building\r\nreeled in Vincent\'s eyes, as he caught sight of that thin head, dark and\r\nsilent, gleaming out in all its expressive refinement and intelligence\r\nfrom the common faces round. How he kept still and went on was to\r\nhimself a kind of miracle. Had she moved or left the place, he could not\r\nhave restrained himself. But she did not move. He watched her, even\r\nwhile he prayed, with a profanity of which he was conscious to the\r\nheart. He watched her with her frightful composure finding the hymn,\r\nstanding up with the rest to sing. When she disappeared, he rushed from\r\nthe pulpit--rushed out--pursued her. She was not to be seen anywhere\r\nwhen he got outside, and the first stream of the throng of dispersing\r\nworshippers, which fortunately, however, included none of the leading\r\npeople of Salem, beheld with amazed eyes the minister who darted through\r\nthem, and took his hurried way to Back Grove Street. Could she have gone\r\nthere? He debated the question vainly with himself as he hastened on the\r\nfamiliar road. The door was open as of old, the children playing upon\r\nthe crowded pavement. He flew up the staircase, which creaked under his\r\nhasty foot, and knocked again at the well-known door, instinctively\r\npausing before it, though he had meant to burst in and satisfy himself.\r\nSuch a violence was unnecessary--as if the world had stood still, Mrs.\r\nHilyard opened the door and stood before him, with her little kerchief\r\non her head, her fingers still marked with blue. "Mr. Vincent," said\r\nthis incomprehensible woman, admitting him without a moment\'s\r\nhesitation, pointing him to a chair as of old, and regarding him with\r\nthe old steady look of half-amused observation, "you have never come to\r\nsee me on a Sunday before. It is the best day for conversation for\r\npeople who have work to do. Sit down, take breath; I have leisure, and\r\nthere is time now for everything we can have to say."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nVINCENT put out his hand to seize upon the strange woman who confronted\r\nhim with a calmness much more confounding than any agitation. But her\r\nquick eye divined his purpose. She made the slightest movement aside,\r\nextended her own, and had shaken hands with him in his utter surprise\r\nbefore he knew what he was doing. The touch bewildered his faculties,\r\nbut did not move him from the impulse, which was too real to yield to\r\nanything. He took the door from her hand, closed it, placed himself\r\nagainst it. "You are my prisoner," said Vincent. He could not say any\r\nmore, but gazed at her with blank eyes of determination. He was no\r\nlonger accessible to reason, pity, any sentiment but one. He had secured\r\nher. He forgot even to be amazed at her composure. She was his\r\nprisoner--that one fact was all he cared to know.\r\n\r\n"I have been your prisoner the entire morning," said Mrs. Hilyard, with\r\nan attempt at her old manner, which scarcely could have deceived the\r\nminister had he preserved his wits sufficiently to notice it, but at the\r\nsame time betraying a little surprise, recognising instinctively that\r\nhere she had come face to face with those blind forces of nature upon\r\nwhich no arguments can tell. "You were in much less doubt about your\r\npower of saving souls the last time I heard you, Mr. Vincent. Sit down,\r\nplease. It is not long since we met, but many things have happened. It\r\nis kind of you to give me so early an opportunity of talking them over.\r\nI am sorry to see you look excited--but after such exertions, it is\r\nnatural, I suppose----"\r\n\r\n"You are my prisoner," repeated Vincent, without taking any notice of\r\nwhat she said. He was no match for her in any passage of arms. Her words\r\nfell upon his ears without any meaning. Only a dull determination\r\npossessed him. He locked the door, while she, somewhat startled in her\r\nturn, stood looking on; then he went to the window, threw it open, and\r\ncalled to some one below--any one--he did not care who. "Fetch a\r\npoliceman--quick--lose no time!" cried Vincent. Then he closed the\r\nwindow, turned round, and confronted her again. At last a little\r\nagitation was visible in this invulnerable woman. For an instant her\r\nhead moved with a spasmodic thrill, and her countenance changed. She\r\ngave a rapid glance round as if to see whether any outlet was left.\r\nVincent\'s eye followed hers.\r\n\r\n"You cannot escape--you shall not escape," he said, slowly; "don\'t think\r\nit--nothing you can do or say will help you now."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Mrs. Hilyard, with a startled, panting breath. "You have come\r\nto the inexorable," she said, after a moment; "most men do, one time or\r\nanother. You decline meeting us on our ground, and take to your own.\r\nVery well," she continued, seating herself by the table where she had\r\nalready laid down one of the Salem hymn-books; "till this arrival\r\nhappens, we may have a little conversation, Mr. Vincent. I was about to\r\ntell you something which ought to be good news. Though you don\'t\r\nappreciate my regard for you, I will tell it you all the same. What\r\nnoise is that? Oh, the boys, I suppose, rushing off for your policeman.\r\nI hope you know what you are going to say to that functionary when he\r\ncomes. In the mean time, wait a little--you must hear my news."\r\n\r\nThe only answer Vincent made was to look out again from the window,\r\nunder which a little group of gazers had already collected. His\r\ncompanion heard the sounds below with a thrill of alarm more real than\r\nshe had ever felt before. She sat rigidly, with her hand upon the\r\nhymn-book, preserving her composure by a wonderful effort, intensely\r\nalive and awake to everything, and calculating her chances with a\r\ncertain desperation. This one thing alone of all that had happened, the\r\nBack Grove Street needlewoman, confident in her own powers and\r\ninfluence, had not foreseen.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" she cried, with an excitement and haste which she could not\r\nquite conceal. "That man is not dead, you know. Come here--shut the\r\nwindow! Young man, do you hear what I say to you? Am I likely to indulge\r\nin vain talk now? Come here--here! and understand what I have to say."\r\n\r\n"It does not matter," said Vincent, closing the window. "What you say\r\ncan make no difference. There is but one thing possible now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are a man!" cried the desperate woman, clasping her hands\r\ntight, and struggling with herself to keep down all appearance of her\r\nanxiety. "You are deaf, blind! You have turned your back upon reason.\r\nThat is what it always comes to. Hush! come here--closer; they make so\r\nmuch noise in the street. I believe," she said, with a dreadful smile,\r\n"you are afraid of me. You think I will stab you, or something. Don\'t\r\nentertain such vulgar imaginations, Mr. Vincent. I have told you before,\r\nyou have fine manners, though you are only a Dissenting minister. I have\r\nsomething to tell you--something you will be glad to know----"\r\n\r\nHere she made another pause for breath--merely for breath--not for any\r\nanswer, for there was no answer in her companion\'s face. He was\r\nlistening for the footsteps in the street--the steps of his returning\r\nmessengers. And so was she, as she drew in that long breath, expanding\r\nher forlorn bosom with air, which the quick throbs of her heart so soon\r\nexhausted. She looked in his eyes with an eager fire in her own,\r\nsteadily, without once shifting her gaze. The two had changed places. It\r\nwas he, in his inexorableness, close shut up against any appeal or\r\nargument, that was the superior now.\r\n\r\n"When you hear what I have to say, you will not be so calm," she went\r\non, with another involuntary heave of her breast. "Listen! your sister\r\nis safe. Yes, you may start, but what I say is true. Don\'t go to the\r\nwindow yet. Stop, hear me! I tell you your sister is safe. Yes, it may\r\nbe the people you have sent for. Never mind, this is more important. You\r\nhave locked the door, and nobody can come in. I tell you again and\r\nagain, your sister is safe. That man is not dead--you know he is not\r\ndead. And yesterday--hush! never mind!--yesterday," she said, rising up\r\nas Vincent moved, and detaining him with her hand upon his arm, which\r\nshe clutched with desperate fingers, "he made a declaration that it was\r\nnot she; a declaration before the magistrates," continued Mrs. Hilyard,\r\ngasping as her strength failed her, and following him, holding his arm\r\nas he moved to the window, "that it was not she--not she! do you\r\nunderstand me--not she! He swore to it. He said it was another, and not\r\nthat girl. Do you hear me?" she cried, raising her voice, and shaking\r\nhis arm wildly in the despair of the moment, but repeating her words\r\nwith the clearness of desperation--"He said on his oath it was not she."\r\n\r\nShe had followed him to the window, not pleading for herself by a single\r\nword, but with her desperate hand upon his arm, her face pinched and\r\npale to the lips, and a horrible anxiety gleaming in the eyes which she\r\nnever removed from his face. The two stood together there for a moment\r\nin that silent encounter; he looking down at the group of people below,\r\nshe watching his face with her eyes, clutching his arm with her hand,\r\nappealing to him with a speechless suspense and terror, which no words\r\ncan describe. Her fate hung upon the merest thread, and she knew it. She\r\nhad no more power to move him in her own person than any one of the\r\nragged children who stood gazing up at the window. There he stood,\r\nsilent, blank, immovable; and she, suffering no expression of her\r\ndreadful suspense to escape her, stood clutching his arm, seeing, as\r\nshe had never seen before, a pale vision of prisons, scaffolds,\r\njudgments, obscuring earth and heaven. She was brave, and had dared them\r\nall wittingly in the crisis of her fate, but the reality caught the\r\nlabouring breath from her lips, and turned her heart sick. This morning\r\nshe had woke with a great burden taken off her mind, and, daring as she\r\nwas, had faced the only man who had any clue to her secret, confident in\r\nhis generous nature and her own power over him. But this confidence had\r\nfailed her utterly, and in the very ease and relief of her mind--a\r\nrelief more blessed and grateful than she could have acknowledged to any\r\nmortal--lo! here arose before her close and real the spectre which she\r\nhad defied. It approached step by step, while she gazed with wild eyes\r\nand panting breath upon the inexorable man who had it in his power to\r\ndeliver her over to law and justice. She dared not say a word of\r\nentreaty to him; she could only watch his eyes, those eyes which never\r\nlighted upon her, with speechless dread and anxiety. Many evils she had\r\nborne in her life--many she had confronted and overcome--obstinate will\r\nand unscrupulous resolution had carried her one way or other through all\r\nformer dangers. Here for the first time she stood helpless, watching\r\nwith an indescribable agony the face of the young man at whom she had so\r\noften smiled. Some sudden unforeseen touch might still set her free. Her\r\nbreath came quick in short gasps--her breast heaved--her fate was\r\nabsolutely beyond her own control, in Vincent\'s hands.\r\n\r\nJust then there came into the narrow street a sound of carriage-wheels.\r\nInstinctively Vincent started. The blank of his determination was broken\r\nby this distant noise. Somehow it came naturally into the silence of\r\nthis room and woke up the echoes of the past in his mind; the past--that\r\npast in which Lady Western\'s carriage was the celestial chariot, and she\r\nthe divinest lady of life. Like a gleam of light there suddenly dawned\r\naround him a remembrance of the times he had seen her here--the times he\r\nhad seen her anywhere; the last time--the sweet hand she had laid upon\r\nhis arm. Vincent\'s heart awoke under that touch. With a start he looked\r\ndown upon the hand which was at this moment on his arm,--not the hand of\r\nlove,--fingers with the blood pressed down to the very tips, holding\r\nwith desperation that arm which had the power of life and death. A\r\nhurried exclamation came from his lips; he looked at the woman by him,\r\nand read vaguely in her face all the passion and agony there. Vaguely it\r\noccurred to him that to save or to sacrifice her was in his hands, and\r\nthat he had but a moment now to decide. The carriage-wheels came nearer,\r\nnearer, ringing delicious promises in his ears--nearer too came the\r\nservants of that justice he had invoked; and what plea was it, what\r\nstrange propitiation, which his companion had put forth to him to stay\r\nhis avenging hand? Only a moment now; he shook her hand off his arm, and\r\nin his turn took hold of hers; he held her fast while she faced him in\r\nan agony of restrained suspense and terror. How her worn bosom panted\r\nwith that quick coming breath! Her life was in his hands.\r\n\r\n"What was that you said?" asked Vincent, with the haste and brevity of\r\npassion, suddenly perceiving how much had to be done in this moment of\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThe long-restrained words burst from his companion\'s lips almost before\r\nhe had done speaking. "I said your sister was safe!" she cried; "I said\r\nhe had declared her innocent on his oath. It was not she--he has sworn\r\nit, all a man could do. To sacrifice another," she went on breathlessly\r\nwith a strong momentary shudder, pausing to listen, "will do nothing for\r\nher--nothing! You hear what I say. It was not she; he has sworn upon his\r\nsolemn oath. Do as you will. She is safe--safe!--as safe as--as-- God\r\nhelp me--as safe as my child,--and it was for her sake----"\r\n\r\nShe stopped--words would serve her no further--and just then there came\r\na summons to the locked door. Vincent dropped her arm, and she recoiled\r\nfrom him with an involuntary movement; unawares she clasped her thin\r\nhands and gave one wild look into his face. Not even now could she tell\r\nwhat he was going to do, this dreadful arbiter of fate. The key, as he\r\nturned it in the door, rang in her ears like thunder; and his hand\r\ntrembled as he set open the entrance of the needlewoman\'s mean\r\napartment. On the threshold stood no vulgar messenger of fate, but a\r\nbright vision, sad, yet sweeter than anything else in earth or almost in\r\nheaven to Vincent. He fell back without saying anything before the\r\nstartled look of that beautiful face. He let in, not law and justice,\r\nbut love and pity, to this miserable room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Rachel! where have you been? have you seen him? have you heard of\r\nhim? where have you been?" cried the visitor, going up to the pallid\r\nwoman, whose eyes were still fixed on Vincent. Mrs. Hilyard could not\r\nspeak. She dropped upon her knees by the table, shivering and crouching\r\nlike a stricken creature. She leaned her head upon the hymn-book which\r\nlay there so strangely at variance with everything else around it. Pale\r\nwith fright and horror, Lady Western appealed to Vincent. "She is ill,\r\nshe is fainting--oh, Mr. Vincent, what have you been saying to her? She\r\nwas not to blame," cried the new-comer, in her ignorance. Vincent\r\nattempted no reply, offered no help. In his heart he could have snatched\r\naway those beautiful hands which embraced and comforted his "prisoner,"\r\nthus rescued out of his grasp. It was hard to see her touch that guilty\r\nconscious woman whom his own heart refused to pity. He stood by looking\r\non, watching her still; the instinct of vengeance had been awakened\r\nwithin him. He was reluctant to let her go.\r\n\r\n"You have been saying something to her," said Lady Western, with tears\r\nin her eyes; "and how could she be to blame? Rachel! Oh, I wonder, I\r\nwonder if she loved him after all?" cried the beautiful creature, in the\r\nbewilderment of her innocence and ignorance. She stood bending over the\r\nkneeling figure, troubled, perplexed almost more than her strange\r\nsister-in-law had ever yet perplexed her. She could not account for this\r\nextraordinary access of agitation. It was nohow explainable, except\r\nupon that supposition which opened at once the warmest sympathies of the\r\ngentle young woman\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"Rachel, dear!" she cried, kissing softly the thin hands worn with toil\r\nthat covered Mrs. Hilyard\'s face--"he is still living, there is hope;\r\nperhaps he will get better; and he is showing a better mind too," she\r\nadded, after a little tremulous pause. "I came to see if you had come\r\nhome to tell you; he has sworn that it was not--oh, Mr. Vincent, I sent\r\nyou word immediately when I got the message--he says it was not your\r\nsister; she had nothing to do with it, he says. Now I can look you in\r\nthe face again. The first thing he was able to do when he came to\r\nhimself was to clear her; and now she will get better--and your dear\r\nmother?"--said Lady Western, looking wistfully into the young man\'s\r\nface. In that moment, while her attention was directed otherwise, Mrs.\r\nHilyard rose up and took her seat again; took her seat because she was\r\nnot able to stand, and scarcely able, by all the power of her will, to\r\ncompose the nerves which, for the first time in her life, had utterly\r\ngot the better of her. She wiped off the heavy moisture from her face\r\nwith a furtive hand before the young Dowager turned her eyes again that\r\nway. She grasped fast hold of the only thing on the table, the Salem\r\nhymn-book, and with a vast effort regained some degree of self-command.\r\nFor that precious moment she was free from observation, for nothing in\r\nthe world could have prevented Vincent from returning with his own\r\nfascinated eyes the look which Lady Western turned upon him. While the\r\ntwo looked at each other, she was safe; she collected her scattered\r\nforces in that invaluable instant. She was herself again when Lady\r\nWestern looked round, somewhat nervous and embarrassed, from the gaze of\r\npassion with which her look of deprecation and sympathy had been met. If\r\na slight shiver now and then thrilled over Mrs. Hilyard\'s figure, it was\r\nas like to be cold as emotion. Otherwise, she sat with her arm resting\r\non the table and her hand clenched upon the hymn-book, her thin lips\r\nclinging spasmodically to each other, and her face pallid, but to an\r\nuncritical observer scarcely changed from the grey and vigilant\r\ncomposure of her usual appearance. So many storms had passed over that\r\ncountenance, that the momentary agony of horror and fright from which\r\nshe had scarcely yet emerged did not tell as it would have done on a\r\nface less worn. Her voice was sharp and strained when she spoke, and she\r\nwatched Vincent\'s eye with a keenness of which he was vividly conscious;\r\nbut Lady Western, who did not go deep into looks and meanings, found\r\nnothing very unusual in what she said.\r\n\r\n"I think Mr. Vincent was doubtful of my information," she said. "I heard\r\nit last night from Langridge, the groom, who once belonged to my family,\r\nyou know, Alice; and--and lets me know if anything more than usual\r\nhappens," she said, abruptly stopping to draw breath. "I travelled all\r\nnight to get here to-day. Mr. Vincent was doubtful of me. Now this\r\nmatter is cleared up, I daresay he will understand me when I say that I\r\nnever could have allowed things to go further. I am only a\r\nneedle-woman, and live in Back Grove Street," continued Mrs. Hilyard,\r\nrecovering gradually as she spoke; "but I have certain things still in\r\nmy power. Mr. Vincent will understand what I mean," she went on, fixing\r\nher eyes upon him, and unable to repress an occasional gasp which\r\ninterrupted her words, "when I say that I should not have suffered it to\r\ngo further. I should not have shrunk from any sacrifice. My dear, I have\r\nbeen a little shaken and agitated, as you perceive. Mr. Vincent wants to\r\nkeep his eye upon me. Take me with you, Alice," said the bold woman,\r\nonce more looking Vincent full in the face; "take charge of me, keep me\r\nprisoner until all this is cleared up. I am about tired of living a\r\ndisguised princess. Send up your people for my possessions here, and\r\ntake me with you. You will find me safe, Mr. Vincent, when you happen to\r\nwant me, with Lady Western in Grange Lane."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Rachel, I am so glad!" cried Lady Western; "I cannot for my life\r\nimagine what you mean by keeping you my prisoner, and all that; but Mr.\r\nVincent may be very sure you will be safe with me;--since he has so much\r\ninterest in your movements," continued the young Dowager, turning her\r\nperplexed eyes from one to the other. She had not the remotest idea what\r\nit all meant. She was perhaps a little surprised to perceive that, after\r\nall, Vincent\'s interest was less with herself than with this strange\r\nwoman, whose calmness and agitation were equally confusing and\r\nunintelligible. "We shall, of course, always be happy to see Mr. Vincent\r\nin Grange Lane," she concluded, with a somewhat stately courtesy. He\r\ndid not look at her; he was looking at the other, whose eyes were fixed\r\nupon his face. Between these eyes Lady Western, much amazed, could\r\nperceive a secret communication passing. What could it mean? The\r\nconsciousness of this mystery between them which she did not know,\r\nannoyed her, notwithstanding her sweet temper. She withdrew her hand\r\ninstinctively from Mrs. Hilyard\'s, which she had taken in momentary\r\nenthusiasm, and watched their looks of intelligence with half-offended\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the needlewoman, speaking with her eyes fixed upon Vincent,\r\nthough she did not address him, and making a desperate effort after her\r\nusual manner; "I do not think Back Grove Street will do any longer. One\r\nmay as well take advantage of the accident which has brought our family\r\naffairs before the world to come alive again. It is a thing one must do\r\nsooner or later. So, if your carriage is close, Alice, I will go home\r\nwith you. I shall miss Salem," said the audacious woman, "though you are\r\nso much less sure about doing good than you used to be, Mr. Vincent. If\r\nmy soul happens to be saved, however," she continued, with a strange\r\nsoftening of her fixed and gleaming eyes--"if that is of much\r\nimportance, or has any merit in it--you will have had some share in the\r\nachievement. You will?" She said the words with a keen sharpness of\r\ninterrogation, much unlike their more obvious meaning. "You will," she\r\nrepeated again, more softly--"you will!" Her thin hands came together\r\nfor a moment in a clasp of mute supplication; her eyes, always hitherto\r\nlooking down upon him from heights of dark knowledge and experience,\r\nlooked up in his face with an anguish of entreaty which startled\r\nVincent. Just at that moment the sounds in the street grew louder, and a\r\nvoice of authority was audible ordering some one to clear the way. Mrs.\r\nHilyard did not speak, but she put out her hand and touched Lady\r\nWestern\'s shawl, lifting its long fringes, and twisting them round those\r\nfingers on which the marks of her long labour were still visible. She\r\nwithdrew as she did this her eyes from his face. Her fate was absolutely\r\nin his hands.\r\n\r\n"Ladies," said Vincent, hoarsely, after vainly trying to clear his\r\nagitated voice, "it is better you should leave this place at once. I\r\nwill see you to your carriage. If I do wrong, the consequences will fall\r\nhardest on me. Don\'t say anything; either way, talking will do little\r\ngood. You are her shield and defence," he said, looking at Lady Western,\r\nwith an excitement which he could not quite keep under. "When she\r\ntouches you, she becomes sacred. You will keep her safe--safe? you will\r\nnot let her go?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I will keep her safe," said the beauty, opening her lovely\r\nastonished eyes. "Is she in danger? Oh, Mr. Vincent, your trouble has\r\nbeen too much for you! remember your sister is safe now."\r\n\r\n"Is she?" said the minister; he was bitter in his heart, even though\r\nthat hand was once more laid on his arm, "Safe!--with a broken heart and\r\na ruined life; but what does that matter? It is all we are good for;\r\nthough we may go mad and die."\r\n\r\n"Oh, not you! not you!" said Lady Western, gazing at him with the\r\ntenderest pity in her sweet eyes. "You must not say so; I should be so\r\nunhappy." Her beautiful hand pressed his arm with the lightest momentary\r\npressure. She could not help herself; to see suffering and not to do\r\nwhat was in her to soothe it was not possible to her soft heart.\r\nWhatever harm that temporary opiate might do, nothing in the world could\r\nhave prevented her gentle kindness from administering it. She went down\r\nthe humble stairs leaning on his arm, with Mrs. Hilyard following close.\r\nThe young man put aside the little crowd he himself had collected, and\r\nput them in the carriage. He saw them drive away with a kind of\r\ndespairing exaltation and excitement, and turned to the difficulties\r\nwhich remained to him--to explain himself and send the tardy ministers\r\nof justice away. He explained, as he best could, that he had been\r\nmistaken, and once more emptied his scanty purse, where there was now\r\nlittle enough left. When he had got rid of the disappointed group about\r\nthe door, he went home slowly in the reaction of his violence and haste.\r\nSusan was safe; was she safe? delivered from this dreadful\r\naccusation--allowed to drop back at least with her broken heart into the\r\ndeep silences of privacy and uninvadable domestic life. Well, it was a\r\nmercy, a great mercy, though he could not realise it. He went home\r\nslowly, tingling with the strain of these strange hours; was it Sunday\r\nstill? was it only an hour ago that Salem had thrilled to the discourse\r\nin which his passion and despair had found vent? Vincent neither\r\ncomprehended himself nor the hours, full of strange fate, which were\r\ngliding over him. He went home exhausted, as if with a great conflict;\r\nconscious of some relief in his heart, but half unwilling to confess to\r\nit, or to realise the means by which it had dawned upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Vincent entered the house, the sensation of quiet in it struck him\r\nwith a vague consolation which he could scarcely explain. Perhaps only\r\nbecause it was Sunday, but there was no reproachful landlady, no\r\ndistracting sound from above--all quiet, Sunday leisure, Sunday decorum,\r\nas of old. When he went up hurriedly to his sitting-room, he found two\r\nletters lying on his table--one a telegraphic despatch from Dover, the\r\nother a dainty little note, which he opened as a man opens the first\r\nwritten communication he receives from the woman of all women. He knew\r\nwhat was in it; but he read it as eagerly as if he expected to find\r\nsomething new in the mild little epistle, with its gentle attempt at\r\ncongratulation. The news was true. Either remorse had seized upon\r\nMildmay in the prospect of death, or the lingering traditions of honour\r\nin his heart had asserted themselves on Susan\'s behalf. He had declared\r\nher entirely innocent; he had even gone farther, he had sworn that it\r\nwas only as the companion of his daughter that Susan had accompanied\r\nthem, and as such that he had treated her. The deposition taken by the\r\nmagistrates was sent to Vincent in an abridged form, but what it\r\nconveyed was clear beyond dispute. So far as the words of this\r\napparently dying man could be received, Susan was spotless--without\r\nblood on her hand, or speck upon her good fame. The lesser and the\r\ngreater guilt were both cleared from that young head which had not been\r\nstrong enough to wait for this vindication. Though he said, Thank God,\r\nfrom the bottom of his heart, an unspeakable bitterness filled Vincent\'s\r\nsoul as he read. Here was a deliverance, full, lavish, unlooked for; but\r\nwho could tell that the poor girl, crazed with misery, would ever be any\r\nthe better for it? who could tell whether this vindication might be of\r\nany further use than to lighten the cloud upon Susan\'s grave?\r\n\r\nWith this thought in his mind he went to the sick-room, where everything\r\nseemed quiet, not quite sure that his mother, absorbed as she was in\r\nSusan\'s present danger, could be able to realise the wonderful\r\ndeliverance which had come to them. But matters were changed there as\r\nelsewhere. Between the door and the bed on which Susan lay, a large\r\nfolding-screen had been set up, and in the darkened space between this\r\nand the door sat Mrs. Vincent, with Dr. Rider and his wife on each side,\r\nevidently persuading and arguing with her on some point which she was\r\nreluctant to yield to them. They were talking in whispers under their\r\nbreath, and a certain air of stillness, of calm and repose, which\r\nVincent could scarcely comprehend, was in the hushed room.\r\n\r\n"I assure you, on my word," said Dr. Rider, lifting his eyes as Vincent\r\nopened the door, and beckoning him softly to come in, "that this change\r\nis more than I dared hope for. The chances are she will wake up out of\r\ndanger. Nothing can be done for her but to keep her perfectly quiet; and\r\nmy wife will watch, if you will rest;--for our patient\'s sake!" said the\r\nanxious doctor, still motioning Vincent forward, and appealing to him\r\nwith his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent has something to tell you," said the quick little woman,\r\nimpetuous even in her whisper, who was Dr. Rider\'s wife. "He must not\r\ncome and talk here. He might wake her. Take him away. Edward, take them\r\nboth away. Mrs. Vincent, you must go and hear what he has to say."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Arthur! my dear boy," cried his mother, looking up to him with\r\nmoist eyes. "It is I who have something to tell. My child is perhaps to\r\nget well, Arthur. Oh! my own boy, after all, she is going to get better.\r\nWe shall have Susan again. Hush! doctor, please let me go back again;\r\nsomething stirred-- I think something stirred; and perhaps she might want\r\nsomething, and the nurse would not observe. Tired?--no, no; I am not\r\ntired. I have always watched them when they were ill, all their lives.\r\nThey never had any nurse in sickness but their mother. Arthur, you know\r\nI am not tired. Oh! doctor, perhaps you would order something while he\r\nis here, for my son; he has been agitated and anxious, and he is not so\r\nstrong--not nearly so strong as I am; but, my dear," said the widow,\r\nlooking up in her son\'s face with a wistful eagerness, "when Susan gets\r\nbetter, all will be--well."\r\n\r\nShe said the last words with a trembling, prolonged sigh. Poor mother,\r\nin that very moment she had recalled almost for the first time how far\r\nfrom well everything would be. Her face darkened over piteously as she\r\nspoke. She rose up, stung into new energy by this dreadful thought,\r\nwhich had been hitherto mercifully obscured by Susan\'s danger. "Let me\r\ngo back--don\'t say anything. Nobody can watch my child but me," said the\r\nheartbroken woman; and once more she looked in her son\'s face. She\r\nwanted to read there what had happened--to ascertain from him, without\r\nany one else being the wiser, all the dreadful particulars which now, in\r\nthe first relief of Susan\'s recovery, had burst into sudden shape upon\r\nher sight. "Doctor, we will not detain you; her brother and I will watch\r\nmy child," said Mrs. Vincent. The light forsook her eyes as she rose in\r\nthat new and darker depth of anxiety; her little figure tottered trying\r\nto stand as she held out her hand to her son. "You and me--only you and\r\nme, Arthur--we must never leave her; though everybody is so kind----"\r\nsaid the minister\'s mother, turning with her smile of martyrdom, though\r\nher eyes were blind and she could not see them, to Dr. Rider and his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nVincent took his mother\'s hands and put her tenderly back in her chair.\r\n"I have good news, too," he said; "all will be well, mother dear. This\r\nman who has wrought us so much trouble is not dead. I told you, but you\r\ndid not understand it; and he declares that Susan----"\r\n\r\n"Arthur!" cried Mrs. Vincent, with a sharp outcry of alarm and\r\nremonstrance. "Oh, God forgive me! I shall wake my child. Arthur! The\r\ndoctor is very good," added the widow, looking round upon them always\r\nwith the instinct of conciliating Arthur\'s friends; "and so is Mrs.\r\nRider; but every family has its private affairs," she concluded, with a\r\nwistful, deprecating smile, all the time making signs to Arthur to stop\r\nhim in his indiscreet revelations. "My dear, you will tell me presently\r\nwhen we are alone."\r\n\r\n"Ah, mother," said Vincent, with a suppressed groan, "there is nothing\r\nprivate now in our family affairs. Hush! listen-- Susan is cleared; he\r\nswears she had nothing to do with it; he swears that she was his\r\ndaughter\'s companion only. Mother! Good heavens! doctor, what has\r\nhappened? She looks as if she were dying. Mother! What have I done? I\r\nhave killed her with my good news."\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush--she has fainted--all will come right; let us get her away,"\r\ncried Dr. Rider under his breath. Between them the two young men carried\r\nher out of the room, which Mrs. Rider closed after them with a certain\r\ntriumph. The widow was not in so deep a faint but the fresher air\r\noutside and the motion revived her. It was more a sudden failing of her\r\nfaculties in the height of emotion than actual insensibility. She made a\r\nfeeble effort to resist and return into Susan\'s room. "You will wake\r\nher," said Dr. Rider in her ear; and the poor mother sank back in their\r\narms, fixing her wistful misty eyes, in which everything swam, upon her\r\nson. Her lips moved as she looked at him, though he could not hear her\r\nsay a word; but the expression in her face, half awakened only from the\r\nincomprehension of her swoon, was not to be mistaken or resisted.\r\nVincent bent down over her, and repeated what he had said as he carried\r\nher to another room. "Susan is safe--Susan is innocent. It is all over;\r\nmother, you understand me?" he said, repeating it again and again. Mrs.\r\nVincent leaned back upon his shoulder with a yielding of all her\r\nfatigued frame and worn-out mind. She understood him, not with her\r\nunderstanding as yet, but with her heart, which melted into unspeakable\r\nrelief and comfort without knowing why. She closed her eyes in that\r\nwonderful consciousness of some great mercy that had happened to her;\r\nthe first time she had closed them voluntarily for many nights and days.\r\nWhen they laid her down on the bed which had been hurriedly prepared for\r\nher, her eyes were still closed, and tears stealing softly out under the\r\nlids. She could not break out into expressions of thankfulness--the joy\r\nwent to her heart.\r\n\r\nDr. Rider thought it judicious to leave her so, and retired from the\r\nbedside with Vincent, not without some anxious curiosity in his own mind\r\nto hear all "the rights" of the matter. Perhaps the hum of their voices,\r\nquietly though they spoke, aroused her from her trance of silent\r\ngratitude. When she called Arthur faintly, and when they both hurried to\r\nher, Mrs. Vincent was sitting up in her bed wiping off the tears from\r\nher cheeks. "Arthur dear," said the widow, "I am quite sure Dr. Rider\r\nwill understand that what he has heard is in the strictest confidence;\r\nfor to be sure," she continued, with a faint smile breaking over her wan\r\nface, "nobody could have any doubt about my Susan. It only had to be\r\nset right--and I knew when my son came home he would set it right,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Vincent, looking full in Dr. Rider\'s face. "It has all\r\nhappened because I had not my wits about me as I ought to have had, and\r\nwas not used to act for myself; but when my son came back-- Arthur, my\r\nown boy, it was all my fault, but I knew you would set it right--and as\r\nfor my Susan, nobody could have any doubt; and you will both forgive\r\nyour poor mother. I don\'t mind saying this before the doctor," she\r\nrepeated again once more, looking in his face; "because he has seen us\r\nin all our trouble, and I am sure we may trust Dr. Rider; but, my dear,\r\nyou know our private affairs are not to be talked of before\r\nstrangers--especially," said the widow, with a long trembling sigh of\r\nrelief and comfort, "when God has been so good to us, and all is to be\r\nwell."\r\n\r\nThe two young men looked at each other in silence with a certain awe.\r\nAll the dreadful interval which had passed between this Sunday afternoon\r\nand the day of Susan\'s return, had been a blank to Mrs. Vincent so far\r\nas the outer world was concerned. Her daughter\'s illness and danger had\r\nrapt her altogether out of ordinary life. She took up her burden only\r\nwhere it had dropped off from her in the consuming anxiety for Susan\'s\r\nlife and reason, in which all other fears had been lost. Just at the\r\npoint where she had forgotten it, where she had still faced the world\r\nwith the despairing assumption that all would be right when Arthur\r\nreturned, she bethought herself now of that frightful shadow which had\r\nnever been revealed in its full horror to her eyes. Now that Arthur\'s\r\nassurance relieved her heart of that, the widow took up her old position\r\ninstinctively. She knew nothing of the comments in the newspapers, the\r\nvulgar publicity to which poor Susan\'s story had come. She wanted to\r\nimpress upon Dr. Rider\'s mind, by way of making up for her son\'s\r\nimprudence, that he was specially trusted, and that she did not mind\r\nspeaking before him because he had seen all their trouble. Such was the\r\npoor mother\'s idea as she sat upon the bed where they had carried her,\r\nwiping the tears of joy from her wan and worn face. She forgot all the\r\nweary days that had come and gone. She took up the story just at the\r\npoint where she, after all her martyrdom and strenuous upholding of\r\nArthur\'s cause, had suddenly sunk into Susan\'s sick-room and left it.\r\nNow she reappeared with Arthur\'s banner once more in her hands--always\r\nstrong in that assumption that nobody could doubt as to Susan, and that\r\nArthur had but to come home to set all right. Dr. Rider held up his\r\nwarning finger when he saw Vincent about to speak. This delusion was\r\nsalvation to the widow.\r\n\r\n"But I must go back to Susan, doctor," said Mrs. Vincent. "If she should\r\nwake and find a stranger there!--though Mrs. Rider is so kind. But I am\r\nmuch stronger than I look--watching never does me any harm; and now that\r\nmy mind is easy-- People don\'t require much sleep at my time of life.\r\nAnd, Arthur, when my dear child sees me, she will know that all is\r\nwell--all is well," repeated the widow, with trembling lips. "I must go\r\nto Susan, doctor; think if she should wake!"\r\n\r\n"But she must not wake," said Dr. Rider; "and if you stay quietly here\r\nshe will not wake, for my wife will keep everything still. You will have\r\na great deal to do for her when she is awake and conscious. Now you must\r\nrest."\r\n\r\n"I shall have a great deal to do for her? Dr. Rider means she will want\r\nnursing, Arthur," said Mrs. Vincent, "after such an illness; but she\r\nmight miss me even in her sleep, or she might----"\r\n\r\n"Mother, you must rest, for Susan\'s sake; if you make yourself ill, who\r\nwill be able to take care of her?" said Vincent, who felt her hand\r\ntremble in his, and saw with how much difficulty she sustained the\r\nnervous shivering of her frame. She looked up into his face with those\r\nanxious eyes which strove to read his without being able to comprehend\r\nall the meanings there. Then the widow turned with a feminine artifice\r\nto Dr. Rider.\r\n\r\n"Doctor, if you will bring me word that my child is still asleep--if you\r\nwill tell me exactly what you think, and that she is going on well,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Vincent; "you are always so kind. Oh, Arthur, my dear boy,"\r\ncried the widow, taking his hand and caressing it between her own, "now\r\nthat he is gone, tell me. Is it quite true?--is all well again? but you\r\nmust never bring in Susan\'s name. Nobody must have it in their power to\r\nsay a word about your sister, Arthur dear. And, oh, I hope you have been\r\nprudent and not said anything among your people. Hush! he will be coming\r\nback; is it quite true, Arthur? Tell me that my dear child has come\r\nsafe out of it all, and nothing has happened. Tell me! Oh, speak to me,\r\nArthur dear!"\r\n\r\n"It is quite true," said Vincent, meeting his mothers eyes with a\r\nstrange blending of pity and thankfulness. He did not say enough to\r\nsatisfy her. She drew him closer, looking wistfully into his face. The\r\nwinter afternoon was darkening, the room was cold, the atmosphere\r\ndreary. The widow held her son close, and fixed upon him her anxious\r\ninquiring eyes. "It is quite true, Arthur! There is nothing behind that\r\nyou are hiding from me?" she said, with her lips almost touching his\r\ncheek, and her wistful eyes searching his meaning. "Oh, my dear boy,\r\ndon\'t hide anything from me. I am able to bear it, Arthur. Whatever it\r\nis, I ought to know."\r\n\r\n"What I have told you is the simple truth, mother," said Vincent, not\r\nwithout a pang. "He has made a declaration before the magistrates----"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent started so much that the bed on which she sat shook.\r\n"Before the magistrates!" she said, with a faint cry. Then after a\r\npause--"But, thank God, it is not here, Arthur, nor at Lonsdale, nor\r\nanywhere where we are known. And he said that--that--he had never harmed\r\nmy child? Oh, Arthur, Arthur--your sister!--that she should ever be\r\nspoken of so! And he was not killed? I do not understand it, my dear. I\r\ncannot see all the rights of it; but it is a great comfort to have you\r\nto myself for a moment, and to feel as if perhaps things might come\r\nright again. Hush! I think the doctor must be coming. Speak very low.\r\nMy dear boy, you don\'t mean it, but you are imprudent; and, oh, Arthur,\r\nwith a troublesome flock like yours you must not commit yourself! You\r\nmust not let your sister\'s name be talked of among the people. Hush,\r\nhush, I hear the doctor at the door."\r\n\r\nAnd the widow put her son away from her, and leant her head upon her\r\nhands instead of on his shoulder. She would not even let the doctor\r\nsuppose that she had seized that moment to inquire further, or that she\r\nwas anything but sure and confident that all was going well.\r\n\r\n"She is in the most beautiful sleep," said the enthusiastic doctor, "and\r\nNettie is by her. Now, Mrs. Vincent, here is something you must take;\r\nand when you wake up again I will take you to your daughter, and I have\r\nvery little doubt you will find her on the fair way for\r\nrecovery--recovery in every sense," added Dr. Rider, incautiously;\r\n"twice saved--and I hope you will have no more of such uneasiness as you\r\nhave suffered on her behalf."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I have had very little uneasiness with my children," said Mrs.\r\nVincent, drawing up her little figure on the bed. "Susan never had a\r\nsevere illness before. When she came here first she was suffering from\r\na--a bad fright, doctor. I told you so at the time; and I was so weak\r\nand so alarmed, Arthur dear, that I fear Dr. Rider has misunderstood me.\r\nWhen one is not much used to illness," said the mother, with her\r\npathetic jesuitry, "one thinks there never was anything so bad as one\'s\r\nown case, and I was foolish and upset. Yes, I will take it, doctor. Now\r\nthat I am easy in my mind, I will take anything you please; and you will\r\nlet me know if she wakes, or if she stirs. Whatever happens, you will\r\nlet me know that moment? Arthur, you will see that they let me know."\r\n\r\nThe doctor promised, anxiously putting the draught into her hands: he\r\nwould have promised any impossible thing at the moment, so eager was he\r\nto get her persuaded to rest.\r\n\r\n"I have not talked so much for-- I wonder how long it is?" said the\r\nwidow, with a faint smile. "Oh, Arthur dear, I feel as if somehow a\r\nmillstone had been on my heart, and God had taken it off. Doctor, it\r\nis--it is--all your doing, under Providence," said the little woman,\r\nlooking full in his face. Perhaps she believed it--at least she meant\r\nhim to believe so. She swallowed the draught he gave her with that smile\r\nupon her face, and laid down her throbbing head in the quietness and\r\ndarkness. "Go with the doctor, Arthur dear," she said, denying the\r\nyearning in her heart to question her son farther, lest Dr. Rider might\r\nperhaps suppose all was not so well as she said; "and, oh be sure to\r\ntell me the very moment that Susan wakes?" She watched them gliding\r\nnoiselessly out of the room, two dark figures, in the darkness. She lay\r\ndown alone, throbbing all over with thrills of pain, which were half\r\npleasure. She began to be conscious again of her own body and life; and\r\nthe wistful curiosity that possessed her was not strong enough to\r\nneutralise the positive unmistakable joy. Susan was recovering. Susan\r\nwas innocent. What trouble could there be heavy enough to take away the\r\ncomfort out of words like these!\r\n\r\n"Now she will sleep. Mr. Vincent, I congratulate you on having such pure\r\nblood in your veins; not robust, you know, but far better--such sweet,\r\nperfect health as one rarely meets with nowadays," said the doctor,\r\nunder his breath, with professional enthusiasm; "all the better for your\r\nsister that she came of such a stock. My wife, now, is another\r\nexample--not robust, as I say--natures delicately organised, but in such\r\nexquisite adjustment, and with such elasticity! Mrs. Vincent will go to\r\nsleep like a baby, and wake able for--anything that God may please to\r\nsend her," said Dr. Rider with reverence. "They will both sleep till\r\nto-morrow if all goes well. Hush!-- Well, I may be absurd, for neither of\r\nthem could hear us here; but still it is best to err on the safe side."\r\n\r\n"But Susan--you are not deceiving us--Susan is----" said Vincent, with\r\nsudden alarm.\r\n\r\n"She is asleep," said Dr. Rider; "and, if I can, I will remain till she\r\nwakes; it is life or death."\r\n\r\nThey parted thus--the doctor to the little room below-stairs, where\r\nVincent\'s dinner awaited him, and the young minister himself to his own\r\nroom, where he went into the darkness with a kind of bewildered\r\nuncertainty and incomprehension of the events about him. To think that\r\nthis day, with all its strange encounters and unexpected incidents, was\r\nSunday, as he suddenly remembered it to be--that this morning he had\r\npreached, and this evening had to preach again, completed in Vincent\'s\r\nmind the utter chaos and disturbance of ordinary life. It struck him\r\ndumb to remember that by-and-by he must again ascend the pulpit, and go\r\nthrough all his duties. Was he an impostor, doing all this mechanically?\r\nHe debated the question dully in his own mind, as he sat too much\r\nbewildered to do anything else in the dark in his bed-chamber, pondering\r\nwith a certain confused gravity and consolation over all that had\r\nhappened. But faculties, which are confused by sudden comfort and\r\nrelief, are very different from faculties obscured and confounded by\r\nsuffering. He sat vaguely in the dark, wondering over his strange\r\nposition. This morning, even in the height of his despair, he had at\r\nleast some idea what he was going to do in that pulpit of Salem. It was\r\na sacrifice--a martyrdom to accomplish--a wild outcry and complaint to\r\npour forth to the world. This evening he sat wasting the precious\r\nmoments in the soft darkness, without knowing a word of what he was to\r\nsay--without being able to realise the fact, that by-and-by he should\r\nhave to go out through the sharp air echoing with church-bells--to see\r\nonce more all those watchful faces turned upon him, and to communicate\r\nsuch instruction as was in him to his flock. A sense of exhaustion and\r\nsatisfaction was in Vincent\'s heart. He sat listless in a vague comfort\r\nand weariness, his head throbbing with the fumes of his past excitement,\r\nyet not aching. It was only now that he realised the rolling off from\r\nhis head of this dark cloud of horror and shame. Susan was\r\nrecovering--Susan was innocent. He became aware of the facts much in the\r\nsame way as his mother became aware of them ere she dropped to sleep in\r\nthe blessed darkness of the adjoining room. Confused as he was, with his\r\nbrain still full of the pulsations of the past, he was so far conscious\r\nof what had happened. He sat in his reverie, regardless of the time, and\r\neverything else that he ought to have attended to. The little maid came\r\nand knocked at his door to say his dinner had been waiting for an hour,\r\nand he answered, "Yes; he was coming," but sat still in the darkness.\r\nThen the landlady herself, compunctious, beginning to feel the thrills\r\nof returning comfort which had entered her house, came tapping softly to\r\nsay it was near six, and wouldn\'t Mr. Vincent take something before it\r\nwas time for chapel? Mr. Vincent said "Yes" again, but did not move; and\r\nit was only when he heard the church-bells tingling into the night air\r\nthat he got up at last, and, stealing first to the door of Susan\'s room,\r\nwhere he ascertained that she still slept, and then to his mother\'s,\r\nwhere he could hear her soft regular breathing in the darkness, he went\r\naway in an indescribably exalted condition of mind to Salem and his\r\nduty. There is a kind of weakness incident to excitement of mind and\r\nneglect of body, which is akin to the ecstatic state in which men dream\r\ndreams and see visions. Vincent was in that condition to-night. He was\r\nnot careful what anybody would say or think; he no longer pictured to\r\nhimself the up-turned faces in Salem, all conscious of the tragedy which\r\nwas connected with his name. The sense of deliverance in his heart\r\nemancipated him, and gave a contrary impulse to his thoughts. In the\r\nweakness of an excited and exhausted frame, a certain gleam of the\r\nineffable and miraculous came over the young man. He was again in the\r\nworld where God stoops down to change with one touch of His finger the\r\nwhole current of man\'s life--the world of childhood, of genius, of\r\nfaith; that other world, dark sphere of necessity and fate, where\r\nnothing could stay the development into dread immortality of the\r\nobstinate human intelligence, and where dreary echoes of speculation\r\nstill questioned whether any change were possible in heart and spirit,\r\nor if saving souls were a mere figure of speech, floated away far off\r\nover his head, a dark fiction of despair. In this state of mind he went\r\nback to the pulpit where, in the morning, he had thrilled his audience\r\nwith all those wild complications of thought which end in nothing. Salem\r\nwas again crowded--not a corner of the chapel remained unfilled; and\r\nagain, many of the more zealous members were driven out of their seats\r\nby the influx of the crowd. Vincent, who had no sermon to preach, and\r\nnothing except the fulness that was in his heart to say, took up again\r\nhis subject of the morning. He told his audience with the unpremeditated\r\nskill of a natural orator, that while Reason considered all the\r\ndesperate chances, and concluded that wonderful work impossible, God,\r\nwith the lifting of His countenance, with the touch of His power, made\r\nthe darkness light before Him, and changed the very earth and heavens\r\naround the wondering soul. Lifted out of the region of reasonableness\r\nhimself, he explained to his astonished audience how Reason halts in her\r\nconclusions, how miracle and wonder are of all occurrences the most\r\nnatural, and how, between God and man, there are no boundaries of\r\npossibility. It was a strange sermon, without any text or divisions,\r\nirregular in its form, sometimes broken in its utterance; but the man\r\nwho spoke was in a "rapture"--a state of fasting and ecstasy. He saw\r\nindistinctly that there were glistening eyes in the crowd, and felt what\r\nwas somewhat an unusual consciousness--that his heart had made\r\ncommunications to other hearts in his audience almost without his\r\nknowing it; but he did not observe that nobody came to the vestry to\r\ncongratulate him, that Tozer looked disturbed, and that the deacons\r\naverted their benign countenances. When he had done his work, he went\r\nhome without waiting to talk to anybody--without, indeed, thinking any\r\nmore of Salem--through the crowd, in the darkness, passing group after\r\ngroup in earnest discussion of the minister. He went back still in that\r\nexalted condition of mind, unaware that he passed Mrs. Tozer and\r\nPhoebe, who were much disposed to join him--and was in his own house\r\nsooner than most of his congregation. All within was quiet, lost in the\r\nmost grateful and profound stillness. Sleep seemed to brood over the\r\ndelivered house. Vincent spoke to the doctor, who still waited, and\r\nwhose hopes were rising higher and higher, and then ate something, and\r\nsaid his prayers, and went to rest like a child. The family, so worn out\r\nwith labour, and trial, and sorrow, slept profoundly under the quiet\r\nstars. Those hard heavens, from which an indifferent God saw the\r\nInnocents murdered and made no sign, had melted into the sweet natural\r\nfirmament, above which the great Father watches unwearied. The sudden\r\nchange was more than mere deliverance to the young Nonconformist. He\r\nslept and took rest in the sweet surprise and thankfulness of his soul.\r\nHis life and heart, still young and incapable of despair, had got back\r\nout of hard anguishes and miseries which no one could soften, to the\r\nsweet miraculous world in which circumstances are always changing, and\r\nGod interferes for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Vincent awoke next morning, his mother was standing by his bedside.\r\nHer eyes were dewy and moist, a faint tinge of colour was on her sweet\r\nold cheek, and her steps tottered a little as she came up to his bed,\r\nand stooped to kiss him. "Oh, Arthur, my dear boy, she knows me!" said\r\nMrs. Vincent, putting up her hand to her eyes. "I must not be away from\r\nher a moment, but I could not resist coming to tell you. She knows me,\r\ndear. Make haste and dress, and come and see your sister, Arthur; and I\r\nwill give orders about your breakfast as I go back. My dear, I know you\r\nhave been anxious," said the widow, putting back his hair fondly with\r\nthe soft little hand which still trembled; "though men have not the way\r\nof showing it, I know you have been very anxious. You looked quite pale\r\nand thin as you slept. But I must speak to the landlady now and see\r\nabout your food. Come to Susan\'s room as soon as you are dressed, and I\r\nwill order your breakfast, my dear boy," said his mother, going softly\r\nout again, with her tender little figure all beautified and trembling\r\nwith joy. Mrs. Vincent met the landlady near the door, and stopped to\r\nspeak to her. "My daughter is a great deal better," said the minister\'s\r\nmother. "I have been so anxious, I have never been able to thank you as\r\nI ought to have done for your kindness and attention. We have been as\r\nquiet as if we had been at home. We will all remember your attention,\r\nthough I have never been able to thank you before; and I am sure it is\r\nvery gratifying to my son to think it is one of his own flock who has\r\ntaken so much pains for us. Mr. Vincent has been very anxious about his\r\nsister," continued the widow; "I fear he has not been taking his food,\r\nnor keeping his regular time for meals. You would oblige me very much if\r\nyou would try to have something nice for his breakfast. We were all much\r\nshaken yesterday, being so anxious;--some new-laid eggs perhaps--though\r\nI know they are scarce in a town at this time of the year--or anything\r\nyou can think of that will tempt him to eat. I would not say so much,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Vincent, smiling upon the astonished landlady, and leaning to\r\nsupport her own weakness on the rail of the passage upon which the\r\nstaircase opened, "but that I know your kind interest in your minister.\r\nI am sure you will take all the pains you can to get him to attend to\r\nhis precious health. Thank you. I am very much obliged."\r\n\r\nWith this the little woman passed on, feeling indeed too weak to stand\r\nlonger; and leaving the landlady, who had intended to mingle some\r\nstatement of her own grievances with her congratulations, with the plea\r\nquietly taken out of her hands, and the entire matter disposed of. Mrs.\r\nVincent was moving back again to the sick-room, when the door opened\r\ndown-stairs, and some one asked for Mr. Vincent, and came up hurriedly.\r\nThe minister\'s mother recognised Tozer\'s voice, and made a pause. She\r\nwas glad of the opportunity to make sure that all was well in the flock.\r\nShe leant over the railing to shake hands with the butterman, moved to a\r\nlittle effusion of thankfulness by the recollection of the state of\r\nanxiety she was in when she saw him last.\r\n\r\n"My son is not up yet," she said. "We were very anxious yesterday. It\r\nwas the crisis of the fever, and everything depended upon it. I daresay\r\nyou would see how anxious Mr. Vincent was; but, thank heaven, now all is\r\ngoing on well."\r\n\r\n"You see, ma\'am," said Tozer, "it must have all been on the nerves, and\r\nto be sure there ain\'t nothing more likely to be serviceable than good\r\nnews. It\'s in the paper this morning. As soon as I see it, I said to my\r\nmissis, \'This is why the minister was so pecooliar yesterday.\' I divined\r\nit in a moment, ma\'am; though it wasn\'t to say prudent, Mrs. Vincent,\r\nand not as you would have advised no more nor myself, to fly off like\r\nthat out of chapel, without as much as shaking hands with one o\' the\r\ndeacons. But I make allowances, I do; and when I see it in the paper, I\r\nsaid to my missis, \'It\'s all along o\' this Mr. Vincent was so queer.\' I\r\ndon\'t doubt as it\'ll be quite looked over, and thought no more of, when\r\nit\'s known what\'s the news."\r\n\r\n"What news?" said Mrs. Vincent, faintly, holding fast by the railing.\r\n"You mean the news of my dear child\'s recovery," she added, after a\r\nbreathless pause. "Have they put it in the papers? I am sure it is very\r\ngood, but I never heard of such a thing before. She has been very ill\r\nto be sure--but most people are very ill once in their lives," said the\r\nwidow, gasping a little for breath, and fixing her eyes upon the paper\r\nwhich Tozer held in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Poor soul!" said the deacon, compassionately, "it ain\'t no wonder,\r\nconsidering all things. Phoebe would have come the very first day to\r\nsay, Could she be of any use? but her mother wasn\'t agreeable. Women has\r\ntheir own ways of managing; but they\'ll both come to-day, now all\'s\r\ncleared up, if you\'ll excuse me. And now, ma\'am, I\'ll go on to the\r\nminister, and see if there\'s anything as he\'d like me to do, for Pigeon\r\nand the rest was put out, there\'s no denying of it; but if things is set\r\nstraight directly, what with this news, and what with them sermons\r\nyesterday, I don\'t think as it\'ll do no harm. I said to him, as this\r\nSunday was half the battle," said the worthy butterman, reflectively;\r\n"and he did his best-- I wouldn\'t say as he didn\'t do his best; and I\'m\r\nnot the man as will forsake my pastor when he\'s in trouble.\r\nGood-morning, ma\'am; and my best respects to miss, and I hope as she\'ll\r\nsoon be well again. There ain\'t no man as could rejoice more nor me at\r\nthis news."\r\n\r\nTozer went on to Vincent\'s room, at the door of which the minister had\r\nappeared summoning him with some impatience and anxiety. "News? what\r\nnews?" said Mrs. Vincent, faintly to herself, as she held by the rail\r\nand felt the light forsaking her eyes in a new mist of sudden dread. She\r\ncaught the look of the landlady at that moment, a look of half-pity,\r\ncuriosity, and knowledge, which startled her back to her defences. With\r\nsudden firmness she gathered herself together, and went on to the\r\nsick-room, leaving behind her, as she closed the door, the whole\r\ntroubled world, which seemed to know better about her most intimate\r\naffairs than she did; and those newspapers, which somehow mentioned\r\nSusan\'s name, that sweet maiden name which it was desecration to see so\r\nmuch as named in print. Rather the widow carried that uneasy world in\r\nwith her to the sick-room which she had left a few minutes before in all\r\nthe effusion of unhoped-for joy. Everything still was not well though\r\nSusan was getting better. She sat down by the bedside where Susan lay\r\nlanguid and pale, showing the change in her by little more than\r\nquietness and a faint recognition of her mother, and in her troubled\r\nheart began to look the new state of affairs in the face, and to make up\r\nher mind that more of the causes of Susan\'s illness than she had\r\nsupposed known, must have become public. And then Arthur and his flock,\r\nthat flock which he evidently had somehow affronted on the previous day.\r\nMrs. Vincent pondered with all the natural distrust of a woman over\r\nArthur\'s imprudence. She almost chafed at her necessary confinement by\r\nher daughter\'s bedside; if she herself, who had been a minister\'s wife\r\nfor thirty years, and knew the ways of a congregation, and how it must\r\nbe managed, could only get into the field to bring her son out of the\r\ndifficult passages which she had no faith in his own power to steer\r\nthrough! So the poor mother experienced how, when absorbing grief is\r\nremoved, a host of complicated anxieties hasten in to fill up its\r\nplace. She was no longer bowed down under an overwhelming dread, but she\r\nwas consumed by restless desires to be doing--cravings to know\r\nall--fears for what might at the moment be happening out of her range\r\nand influence. What might Arthur, always incautious, be confiding to\r\nTozer even now?--perhaps telling him those "private affairs" which the\r\nwidow would have defended against exposure with her very life--perhaps\r\nchafing at Salem and rejecting that yoke which, being a minister, he\r\nmust bear. It was all Mrs. Vincent could do to keep herself still on her\r\nchair, and to maintain that quietness which was necessary for Susan. If\r\nonly she could have been there to soften his impatience and make the\r\nbest of his unnecessary confidences! Many a time before this, the widow\r\nhad been compelled to submit to that female tribulation--to be shut up\r\napart, and leave the great events outside to be transacted by those\r\nincautious masculine hands, in which, at the bottom of her heart, a\r\nwoman seldom has perfect confidence when her own supervising influence\r\nis withdrawn. Mrs. Vincent felt instinctively that Arthur would commit\r\nhimself as she sat resigned but troubled by Susan\'s bed.\r\n\r\nTozer went directly to the door of Vincent\'s room, where the minister,\r\nonly half-dressed, but much alarmed to see the colloquy which was going\r\non between his mother and the butterman, was waiting for him. The deacon\r\nsqueezed the young man\'s hand with a hearty pressure. His aspect was so\r\nfatherly and confidential, that it brought back to the mind of the young\r\nNonconformist a certain rueful half-comic recollection of the suppers\r\nin the back parlour, and all the old troubles of the pastor of Salem,\r\nwhich heavier shadows had driven out of his mind. Tozer held up\r\ntriumphantly the paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve seen it, sir?" said the butterman; "first thing I did this\r\nmorning was to look up whether there wasn\'t nothing about it in the\r\nlatest intelligence; for the \'Gazette\' has been very particular,\r\nknowing, at Carlingford, folks would be interested--and here it is sure\r\nenough, Mr. Vincent; and we nigh gave three cheers, me and the lads in\r\nthe shop."\r\n\r\nTo this Vincent listened with a darkening brow and an impatience which\r\nhe did not attempt to conceal. He took the paper with again that quick\r\nsense of the intolerable which prompted him to tear the innocent\r\nbroadsheet in pieces and tread it under foot. The \'Gazette\' contained,\r\nwith a heading in large characters, the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n"THE DOVER TRAGEDY.\r\n\r\n"Our reader will be glad to hear that the unfortunate young lady whose\r\nname has been so unhappily mixed up in this mysterious affair, is likely\r\nto be fully exonerated from the charge rashly brought against her. In\r\nthe deposition of the wounded man, which was taken late on Saturday\r\nnight, by Mr. Everett, the stipendiary magistrate of Dover, he\r\ndistinctly declares that Miss---- was not the party who fired the\r\npistol, nor in any way connected with it--that she had accompanied his\r\ndaughter merely as companion on a hasty journey, and that, in short,\r\ninstead of the romantic connection supposed to subsist between the\r\nparties, with all the passions of love and revenge naturally involved,\r\nthe ties between them were of the simplest and most temporary character.\r\nWe are grieved to add, that the fright and horror of her awful position\r\nhad overpowered Miss---- some time before this deposition was made, and\r\nbrought on a brain-fever, which, of course, made the unfortunate young\r\nlady, who is understood to possess great personal attractions, quite\r\nunable to explain the suspicious circumstances surrounding her. We have\r\nnow only to congratulate her respectable family and friends on her\r\nexoneration from a very shocking charge, and hope her innocence will\r\nsoon be confirmed by full legal acquittal. Our readers will find Colonel\r\nMildmay\'s deposition on another page. It will be perceived that he\r\nobstinately refuses to indicate who was the real perpetrator of the\r\ndeed. Suspicion has been directed to his groom, who accompanied him, in\r\nwhom, however, the wounded man seems to repose perfect confidence. He is\r\nstill in a precarious state, but little doubt is entertained of his\r\nultimate recovery."\r\n\r\n"There, Mr. Vincent, that\'s gratifying, that is," said Tozer, as Vincent\r\nlaid down the paper; "and I come over directly I see it, to let you\r\nknow. And I come to say besides," continued the butterman with some\r\ndiffidence, "as I think if you and me was to go off to Mr. Brown the\r\nsolicitor, and give him his orders as he was to put in bail for\r\nMiss---- or anything else as might be necessary--not meaning to use no\r\ndisagreeable words, as there ain\'t no occasion now," said the good\r\ndeacon; "but only to make it plain, as you and me is responsible for\r\nher, if so be as she was ever to be called for again. It would be the\r\nthing to do, that would, sir, if you take my advice. It ain\'t altogether\r\nmy own notion, but was put into my head by one as knows. The gentleman\r\nas come here from Dover inquiring into the business was the one as\r\nsuggested it to me. He turned out uncommon obliging, and wasn\'t to say\r\nno trouble in the house; and when word came as the Colonel wasn\'t dead,\r\nhe went away as civil as could be. I\'ll go with you cheerful to Mr.\r\nBrown, if you\'ll take my advice, afore Mrs. Vincent gets moving about\r\nagain, or the young lady knows what\'s a-going on; that\'s what I\'d do,\r\nsir, if it was me."\r\n\r\nVincent grasped the exultant butterman\'s hand in an overflow of\r\ngratitude and compunction. "I shall never forget your kindness," he\r\nsaid, with a little tremor in his voice. "You have been a true friend.\r\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. I will go at once, and accept\r\nthis other great kindness from you. I shall never forget what I owe to\r\nyou as long as I live."\r\n\r\n"I never was the man to forsake my pastor in trouble--not to say a young\r\nman like you as is a credit to the connection, and the best preacher I\r\nmay say as I ever heard in Salem," said Tozer, with effusion, returning\r\nthe grasp; "but we ain\'t a-going a step till you\'ve had your breakfast.\r\nYour good mother, Mrs. Vincent, as is a real lady, sir, and would never\r\nadvise you different from what I would myself, being for your own\r\ninterests, would have little opinion of me if I took you out on a Monday\r\nmornin\' after your labours without so much as a bit o\' breakfast to\r\nsustain you. I\'ll sit by you while you\'re a-eating of your bacon.\r\nThere\'s a deal to consider of concerning Salem as I couldn\'t well bring\r\nbefore you as long as you were in such trouble. Them were uncommon\r\nsermons, sir, yesterday, I don\'t know as I ever heard anything as was\r\njust to be compared with the mornin\' discourse, and most of the flock\r\nwas of my opinion; but what is the good of standing up for the pastor--I\r\nask you candid, Mr. Vincent--when he\'ll not take no pains to keep things\r\nsquare? I\'m speaking plain, for you can\'t mistake me as it\'s anything\r\nbut your own interests I am a-thinking of. We was all marching in,\r\ndeacons and committee and all, to say as we was grateful to you for your\r\ninstructions, and wishing you well out of your trouble--and I was in\r\ngreat hopes as matters might have been made up--when behold, what we\r\nfinds was the vestry empty and the pastor gone! Now, I ain\'t a-finding\r\nfault. Them news would explain anything; but I don\'t deny as Pigeon and\r\nthe rest was put out; and if you\'ll be guided by one as wishes you well,\r\nMr. Vincent, when you\'ve done our business as is most important of all,\r\nyou\'ll go and make some visits, sir, and make yourself agreeable, if\r\nyou\'ll excuse me. It ain\'t with no selfish thoughts as I speak," said\r\nTozer, energetically. "It\'s not like asking of you to come a-visiting to\r\nme, nor setting myself forward as the minister\'s great friend--though\r\nwe was remarking as the pastor was unknown in our house this fortnight\r\nand more--but it\'s for peace and union, Mr. Vincent, and the good of the\r\nflock, sir, and to keep--as your good mother well knows ain\'t easy in a\r\ncongregation--all things straight."\r\n\r\nWhen this little peroration was delivered, Vincent was seated at table,\r\nmaking what he could of the breakfast, in which both his mother and\r\nTozer had interested themselves. It was with a little effort that the\r\nyoung man accepted this advice as the character and intentions of his\r\nadviser deserved. He swallowed what was unpalatable in the counsel, and\r\nreceived the suggestion "in as sweet a frame of mind as I could wish to\r\nsee," as Tozer afterwards described.\r\n\r\n"I will go and make myself agreeable," said the minister, with a smile.\r\n"Thank heaven! it is not so impossible to-day as it might have been\r\nyesterday; I left the chapel so hurriedly, because----"\r\n\r\n"I understand, sir," said Tozer, benevolently interposing as Vincent\r\npaused, finding explanation impossible. "Pigeon and the rest was put\r\nout, as I say, more nor I could see was reasonable--not as Pigeon is a\r\nman that knows his own mind. It\'s the women as want the most managing.\r\nNow, Mr. Vincent, I\'m ready, sir, if you are, and we won\'t lose no\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nBefore going out, however, Vincent went to his sister\'s room. She was\r\nlying in an utter quietness which went to his heart;--silent, no longer\r\nuttering the wild fancies of a disordered brain, recovering, as the\r\ndoctor thought; but stretched upon her white couch, marble white,\r\nwithout any inclination apparently to lift the heavy lids of her eyes,\r\nor to notice anything that passed before her--a very sad sight to see.\r\nBy her sat her mother, in a very different condition, anxious, looking\r\ninto Arthur\'s eyes, whispering counsels in his ears. "Oh, my dear boy,\r\nbe very careful," said Mrs. Vincent; "your dear papa always said that a\r\nminister\'s flock was his first duty; and now that Susan is getting\r\nbetter, O Arthur! you must not let people talk about your sister;--and\r\nhave patience, O have patience, dear!" This was said in wistful\r\nwhispers, with looks which only half confided in Arthur\'s prudence; and\r\nthe widow sank into her chair when he left her, folding her hands in a\r\nlittle agony of self-restraint and compulsory quietness. She felt equal\r\nfor it herself, if she had been at liberty to go out upon the flock once\r\nmore in Arthur\'s cause; but who could tell how he might commit himself,\r\nhe who was a young man, and took his own way, and did not know, as Tozer\r\nsaid, how to keep all things straight? When Mrs. Vincent thought of her\r\nson in personal conflict with Mrs. Pigeon, she lost faith in Arthur. She\r\nherself might have conquered that difficult adversary, but what weapons\r\nhad he to bring forth against the deacon\'s wife, he who was only a\r\nminister and a man?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n"AND now that\'s settled, as far as we can settle it now," said Tozer, as\r\nthey left the magistrate\'s office, where John Brown, the famous\r\nCarlingford solicitor, had accompanied them, "you\'ll go and see some of\r\nthe chapel folks, Mr. Vincent? It\'ll be took kind of you to lose no\r\ntime, especially if you\'d say a word just as it\'s all over, and let them\r\nknow the news is true."\r\n\r\n"I will go with you first," said Vincent, who contemplated the\r\nbutterman\'s shop at that moment through a little halo of gratitude and\r\nkindness. He went into the back parlour with the gratified deacon, where\r\nMrs. Tozer sat reading over again the same \'Gazette\' in which poor\r\nSusan\'s history was summed up and ended. It seemed like a year to\r\nVincent since he had dined with his mother at this big table, amid the\r\ndistant odours of all the bacon and cheese. Mrs. Tozer put down the\r\npaper, and took off her spectacles as her visitor came in. "It\'s Mr.\r\nVincent, Phoebe," she said, with a little exclamation. "Dear, dear, I\r\nnever thought as the pastor would be such a strange sight in my\r\nhouse--not as I was meaning nothing unkind, Tozer, so there\'s no\r\noccasion to look at me. I\'m as glad as ever I can be to see the\r\nminister; and what a blessing as it\'s all settled, and the poor dear\r\ngetting well, too. Phoebe, you needn\'t be a-hiding behind me, child,\r\nas if the pastor was thinking of how you was dressed. She has on her\r\nmorning wrapper, Mr. Vincent, as she was helping her mother in, and we\r\ndidn\'t expect no visitors. Don\'t be standing there, as if it was any\r\nmatter to the minister how you was dressed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma, as if I ever thought of such a thing!" said Phoebe, extending\r\na pink uncovered arm out of the loose sleeve of her morning dress to\r\nVincent, and averting her face; "but to see Mr. Vincent is so like old\r\ntimes--and everything has seemed so different--and it is so pleasant to\r\nfeel as if it were all coming back again. Oh ma! to imagine that I ever\r\nsupposed Mr. Vincent could notice my dress, or think of poor me!" added\r\nPhoebe, in a postscript under her breath. The minister heard the\r\nlatter words quite as well as the first. After he had shaken the pink,\r\nplump hand, he sat down on the opposite side of the table, and saw\r\nPhoebe, relieved against the light of the window, wiping a tender tear\r\nfrom her eye. All at once out of the darker and heavier trials which had\r\nabstracted him from common life, the young Nonconformist plunged back\r\ninto the characteristic troubles of his position. As usual, he made no\r\nresponse to Phoebe, found nothing civil to say, but turned with\r\ndesperation to Mrs. Tozer, who was luckily about to speak.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pay no attention to her, Mr. Vincent; she\'s a deal too feelin\'.\r\nShe oughtn\'t to be minded, and then she\'ll learn better," said Mrs.\r\nTozer. "I am sure it wasn\'t no wish of ours as you should ever stop\r\naway. If we had been your own relations we couldn\'t have been more took\r\nup; and where should a minister seek for sympathy if it isn\'t in his own\r\nflock? There ain\'t nobody so safe to put your trust in, Mr. Vincent, as\r\nSalem folks. There\'s a many fine friends a young man may have when he\'s\r\nin a prosperous way, but it ain\'t to be supposed they would stand by him\r\nin trouble; and it\'s then as you find the good of your real friends,"\r\ncontinued Mrs. Tozer, looking with some significance at her husband.\r\nTozer, for his own part, rubbed his hands and stationed himself with his\r\nback to the fire, as is the custom of Englishmen of all degrees. The\r\nhusband and wife contemplated Vincent with complacence. With the kindest\r\nfeelings in the world, they could not altogether restrain a little\r\ntriumph. It was impossible now that the minister could mistake who were\r\nhis true friends.\r\n\r\nBut just then, strangely enough, a vision of a tender smile, a glance up\r\nin his face, the touch of a soft hand, came to Vincent\'s mind. His fine\r\nfriends! he had but one, and she had stood by him in his trouble. From\r\nTozer\'s complacence the minister\'s mind went off with a bound of relief\r\nto that sweet, fruitless sympathy which was dearer than help. From her\r\nsoft perfumy presence to Mrs. Tozer\'s parlour, with that pervading\r\nconsciousness in it of the shop hard by and its store of provisions,\r\nwhat a wonderful difference! It was not so easy to be grateful as he had\r\nat first thought.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tozer has been my real friend indeed, and a most honest and\r\nthorough one," said Vincent. "But I don\'t think I have any other in\r\nSalem so sure and steady," added the minister, after a little pause,\r\nhalf gratefully, half in bitterness. This sentiment was not, however,\r\nresented by the assembled family. Phoebe leaned over her mother\'s\r\nchair, and whispered, "Oh, ma, dear! didn\'t I always say he was full of\r\nfeeling?" somewhat to the discomfiture of the person commented on; while\r\nTozer himself beamed upon the minister from before the blazing fire.\r\n\r\n"I said as we\'d pull you through," said Tozer, "and I said as I\'d stand\r\nby you; and both I\'ll do, sir, you take my word, if you\'ll but stick to\r\nyour duty; and as for standing bail in a hundred pound or two,"\r\ncontinued the butterman, magnanimously, "for a poor young creature as\r\ncouldn\'t be nothing but innocent, I don\'t mind that, nor a deal more\r\nthan that, to keep all things straight. It\'s nothing but my duty. When a\r\nman is a responsible man, and well-known in a place, it\'s his business\r\nto make use of his credit, Mr. Vincent, sir, and his character, for the\r\ngood of his friends."\r\n\r\n"It may be your duty, but you know there ain\'t a many as would have done\r\nit," said his straight-forward wife, "as Mr. Vincent sees himself, and\r\nno need for nobody a-telling of him. There ain\'t a many as would have\r\nstood up for the pastor, right and wrong, and finished off with the\r\nlikes of this, and the minister don\'t need us to say so. Dear, dear, Mr.\r\nVincent, you ain\'t a-going away already, and us hasn\'t so much as seen\r\nyou for I can\'t tell how long? I made sure you\'d stop and take a bit of\r\ndinner at least, not making no ceremony," said Mrs. Tozer, "for there\'s\r\nalways enough for a friend, and you can\'t take us wrong."\r\n\r\nVincent had risen hurriedly to his feet, under the strong stimulant of\r\nthe butterman\'s self-applause. Conscious as he was of all that Tozer had\r\nreally done, the minister found it hard to listen and echo, with due\r\nhumility and gratitude, the perfect satisfaction of the pair over their\r\nown generosity. He had no thanks to say when thus forestalled. "Oh, ma,\r\nhow can you make so much of it?" cried Phoebe. "The minister will\r\nthink us so selfish; and, oh, please Mr. Vincent, when you go home, will\r\nyou speak to your mother, and ask her to let me come and help with her\r\nnursing? I should do whatever she told me, and try to be a comfort to\r\nher--oh, I should indeed!" said Phoebe, clasping those pink hands.\r\n"Nobody could be more devoted than I should be." She cast down her eyes,\r\nand stood the image of maidenly devotedness between Vincent and the\r\nwindow. She struck him dumb, as she always did. He never was equal to\r\nthe emergency where Phoebe was concerned. He took up his hat in his\r\nhands, and tried to explain lamely how he must go away--how he had\r\nvisits to make--duties to do--and would have stuck fast, and lost Mrs.\r\nTozer\'s favour finally and for ever, had not the butterman interposed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s me as is to blame," said the worthy deacon. "If it hadn\'t have\r\nbeen as the pastor wouldn\'t pass the door without coming in, I\'d not\r\nhave had him here to-day; and if you women would think, you\'d see.\r\nWe\'re stanch--and Mr. Vincent ain\'t no call to trouble himself about us;\r\nbut Pigeon and them, you see, as went off in a huff yesterday--that\'s\r\nwhat the minister has got to do. You shan\'t be kep\' no longer, sir, in\r\nmy house. Duty afore pleasure, that\'s my maxim. Good mornin\', and I hope\r\nas you won\'t meet with no unpleasantness; but if you should, Mr.\r\nVincent, don\'t be disheartened, sir--we\'ll pull you through."\r\n\r\nWith this encouraging sentiment, Vincent was released from Mrs. Tozer\'s\r\nparlour. He drew a long breath when he got out to the fresh air in the\r\nstreet, and faced the idea of the Pigeons and other recusants whom he\r\nwas now bound to visit. While he thought of them, all so many varieties\r\nof Mrs. Tozer\'s parlour, without the kindness which met him there, the\r\nheart of the young Nonconformist failed him. Nothing but gratitude to\r\nTozer could have sent him forth at all on this mission of conciliation;\r\nbut now on the threshold of it, smarting from even Tozer\'s\r\nwell-intentioned patronage, a yearning for a little personal comfort\r\nseized upon Vincent\'s mind. It was his duty to go away towards Grove\r\nStreet, where the poulterer\'s residence was; but his longing eyes\r\nstrayed towards Grange Lane, where consolation dwelt. And, besides, was\r\nit not his duty to watch over the real criminal, for whose mysterious\r\nwickedness poor Susan had suffered? It was not difficult to foresee how\r\nthat argument would conclude. He wavered for a few minutes opposite\r\nMasters\'s shop, gave a furtive glance back towards the butterman\'s, and\r\nthen, starting forward with sudden resolution, took his hasty way to\r\nLady Western\'s door; only for a moment; only to see that all was safe,\r\nand his prisoner still in custody. Vincent sighed over the thought with\r\nan involuntary quickening of his heart. To be detained in such custody,\r\nthe young man thought, would be sweeter than heaven; and the wild hope\r\nwhich came and went like a meteor about his path, sprang up with sudden\r\nintensity, and took the breath from his lips, and the colour from his\r\ncheek, as he entered at that green garden door.\r\n\r\nLady Western was by herself in the drawing-room--that room divided in\r\nhalf by the closed doors which Vincent remembered so well. She rose up\r\nout of the low chair in which she reposed, like some lovely swan amid\r\nbillows of dark silken drapery, and held out her beautiful hand to\r\nhim--both her beautiful hands--with an effusion of kindness and\r\nsympathy. The poor young Nonconformist took them into his own, and\r\nforgot the very existence of Salem. The sweetness of the moment took all\r\nthe sting out of his fate. He looked at her without saying anything,\r\nwith his heart in his eyes. Consolation! It was all he had come for. He\r\ncould have gone away thereafter and met all the Pigeons in existence;\r\nbut more happiness still was in store for him--she pointed to a chair on\r\nthe other side of her work-table. There was nobody else near to break\r\nthe charm. The silken rustle of her dress, and that faint perfume which\r\nshe always had about her, pervaded the rosy atmosphere. Out of\r\npurgatory, out of bitter life beset with trouble, the young man had\r\nleaped for one moment into paradise; and who could wonder that he\r\nresigned himself to the spell?\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you have come," said Lady Western. "I am sure you must\r\nhave hated me, and everything that recalled my name; but it was\r\nimpossible for any one to be more grieved than I was, Mr. Vincent. Now,\r\nwill you tell me about Rachel? She sits by herself in her own room. When\r\nI go in she gives me a look of fright which I cannot understand. Fright!\r\nCan you imagine Rachel frightened, Mr. Vincent--and of me!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. I would not venture to come into the presence of the angels if\r\nI had guilt on my hands," said Vincent, not very well knowing what he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent! what can you mean? You alarm me very much," said the young\r\nDowager; "but perhaps it is about her little girl. I don\'t think she\r\nknows where her daughter is. Indeed," said Lady Western, with a cloud on\r\nher beautiful face, "you must not think I ever approved of my brother\'s\r\nconduct; but when he was so anxious to have his child, I think she might\r\nhave given in to him a little--don\'t you think so? The child might have\r\ndone him good perhaps. She is very lovely, I hear. Did you see her? Oh,\r\nMr. Vincent, tell me about it. I cannot understand how you are connected\r\nwith it at all. She trusted in you so much, and now she is afraid of\r\nyou. Tell me how it is. Hush! she is ringing her bell. She has seen you\r\ncome into the house."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to see Mrs.--Mrs. Mildmay," said Vincent, rising up.\r\n"I don\'t know why I came at all, if it were not to see the sun shining.\r\nIt is dark down below where I am," said the young man, with an\r\ninvoluntary outburst of the passion which at that moment suddenly\r\nappeared to him in all its unreasonableness. "Forgive me. It was only a\r\nlonging I had to see the light."\r\n\r\nLady Western looked up with her sweet eyes in the minister\'s face. She\r\nwas not ignorant of the condition of mind he was in, but she was sorry\r\nfor him to the bottom of her heart. To cheer him a little could not harm\r\nany one. "Come back soon," she said, again holding out her hand with a\r\nsmile. "I am so sorry for your troubles; and if we can do anything to\r\ncomfort you, come back soon again, Mr. Vincent." When the poor\r\nNonconformist came to himself after these words, he was standing outside\r\nthe garden door, out of paradise, his heart throbbing, and his pulse\r\nbeating in a kind of sweet delirium. In that very moment of delight he\r\nrecognised, with a thrill of exaltation and anguish, the madness of his\r\ndream. No matter. What if his heart broke after? Now, at least, he could\r\ntake the consolation. But if it was hard to face Mrs. Pigeon before, it\r\nmay well be supposed that it was not easy now, with all this world of\r\npassionate fancies throbbing in his brain, to turn away from his\r\nelevation, and encounter Salem and its irritated deacons. Vincent went\r\nslowly up Grange Lane, trying to make up his mind to his inevitable\r\nduty. When he was nearly opposite the house of Dr. Marjoribanks, he\r\npaused to look back. The garden door was again open, and somebody else\r\nwas going into the enchanted house. Somebody else;--a tall slight\r\nfigure, in a loose light-coloured dress, which he recognised\r\ninstinctively with an agony of jealous rage. A minute before he had\r\nallowed to himself, in an exquisite despair, that to hope was madness;\r\nbut the sight of his rival awoke other thoughts in the mind of the\r\nminister. With quick eyes he identified the companion of his midnight\r\njourney--he in whose name all Susan\'s wretchedness had been wrought--he\r\nwhom Lady Western could trust "with life--to death." Vincent went back\r\nat the sight of him, and found the door now close shut, through which\r\nhis steps had passed. Close shut--enclosing the other--shutting him out\r\nin the cold external gloom. He forgot all he had to do for himself and\r\nhis friends--he forgot his duty, his family, everything in the world but\r\nhopeless love and passionate jealousy, as he turned again to Lady\r\nWestern\'s door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUS while Mrs. Vincent sat in Susan\'s sick-room, with her mind full of\r\ntroubled thoughts, painfully following her son into an imaginary and\r\nunequal conflict with the wife of the rebellious deacon; and while the\r\nSalem congregation in general occupied itself with conjectures how this\r\ninternal division could be healed, and what the pastor would do, the\r\npastor himself was doing the very last thing he ought to have done in\r\nthe circumstances--lingering down Grange Lane in the broad daylight with\r\nintent to pass Lady Western\'s door--that door from which he had himself\r\nemerged a very few minutes before. Why did he turn back and loiter again\r\nalong that unprofitable way? He did not venture to ask himself the\r\nquestion; he only did it in an utterly unreasonable access of jealousy\r\nand rage. If he had been Lady Western\'s accepted lover instead of the\r\nhopeless worshipper afar off of that bright unattainable creature, he\r\ncould still have had no possible right to forbid the entrance of Mr.\r\nFordham at that garden gate. He went back with a mad, unreasoning\r\nimpulse, only excusable in consideration of the excited state of mind\r\ninto which so many past events had concurred to throw him. But the door\r\nopened again as he passed it. Instinctively Vincent stood still,\r\nwithout knowing why. It was not Mr. Fordham who came out. It was a\r\nstealthy figure, which made a tremulous pause at sight of him, and,\r\nuttering a cry of dismay, fixed eyes which still gleamed, but had lost\r\nall their steadiness, upon his face. Vincent felt that he would not have\r\nrecognised her anywhere but at this door. Her thin lips, which had once\r\nclosed so firmly, and expressed with such distinctness the flying shades\r\nof amusement and ridicule, hung apart loosely, with a perpetual quiver\r\nof hidden emotion. Her face, always dark and colourless, yet bearing\r\nsuch an unmistakable tone of vigour and strength, was haggard and\r\nghastly; her once assured and steady step furtive and trembling. She\r\ngave him an appalled look, and uttered a little cry. She shivered as she\r\nlooked at him, making desperate vain efforts to recover her composure\r\nand conceal the agitation into which his sudden appearance had thrown\r\nher. But nature at last had triumphed over this woman who had defied her\r\nso long. She had not strength left to accomplish the cheat. "You!" she\r\ncried, with a shrill tone of terror and confusion in her voice, "I did\r\nnot look for you!" It was all her quivering lips would say.\r\n\r\nThe sight of her had roused Vincent. "You were going to escape," he\r\nsaid. "Do you forget your word? Must I tell her everything, or must I\r\nplace you in surer custody? You have broken your word."\r\n\r\n"My word! I did not give you my word," she cried, eagerly. "No. I--I\r\nnever said--: and," after a pause, "if I had said it, how do you imagine\r\nI was going to escape? Escape! from what? That is the worst--one cannot\r\nescape," said the miserable woman, speaking as if by an uncontrollable\r\nimpulse, "never more; especially if one keeps quiet in one place and has\r\nnothing to do," she continued after a pause, recovering herself by\r\nstrange gleams now and then for a moment; "that is why I came out, to\r\nescape, as you say, for half an hour, Mr. Vincent. Besides, I don\'t have\r\nnews enough--not nearly enough. How do you think I can keep still when\r\nnobody sends me any news? How long is it since I saw you last? And I\r\nhave heard nothing since then--not a syllable! and you expect me to sit\r\nstill, because I have given my word? Besides," after another breathless\r\npause, and another gleam of self-recovery, "the laws of honour don\'t\r\nextend to women. We are weak, and we are allowed to lie."\r\n\r\n"You are speaking wildly," said Vincent, with some compassion and some\r\nhorror, putting his hand on her arm to guide her back to the house. Mrs.\r\nHilyard gave a slight convulsive start, drew away from his touch, and\r\ngazed upon him with an agony of fright and terror in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"We agreed that I was to stay with Alice," she said. "You forget I am\r\nstaying with Alice: she--she keeps me safe, you know. Ah! people change\r\nso; I am sometimes--half afraid--of Alice, Mr. Vincent. My child is like\r\nher--my child--she did not know me!" cried the wretched woman, with a\r\nsob that came out of the depths of her heart; "after all that happened,\r\nshe did not know me! To be sure, that was quite natural," she went on\r\nagain, once more recovering her balance for an instant, "she could not\r\nknow me! and I am not beautiful, like Lady Western, to please a child\'s\r\neye. Beauty is good--very good. I was once pretty myself; any man would\r\nhave forgiven me as you did when Alice came with her lovely face; but I\r\ndaresay your mother would not have minded had it been she. Ah, that\r\nreminds me," said Mrs. Hilyard, gradually acquiring a little more\r\nsteadiness, "that was why I came out: to go to your mother--to ask if\r\nperhaps she had heard anything--from my child."\r\n\r\n"This is madness," said Vincent; "you know my mother could not possibly\r\nhear about your child; you want to escape-- I can see it in your eyes."\r\n\r\n"If you will tell me what kind of things people can escape from, I will\r\nanswer you," said his strange companion, still becoming more composed.\r\n"Hush! I said what was true. The governess, you know, had your address.\r\nIs it very long since yesterday when I got that news from Dover? Never\r\nmind. I daresay I am asking wild questions that cannot have any answer.\r\nDo you remember being here with me once before? Do you remember looking\r\nthrough the grating and seeing----? Ah, there is Mr. Fordham now with\r\nAlice! Poor young man!" said Mrs. Hilyard, turning once more to look at\r\nhim, still vigilant and anxious, but with a softened glance. "Poor\r\nminister! I told you not to fall in love with her lovely face. I told\r\nyou she was kind, too kind--she does not mean any harm. I warned you.\r\nWho could have thought then that we should have so much to do with each\r\nother?" she resumed, shrinking from him, and trying to conceal how she\r\nshrank with another convulsive shiver; "but you were going to visit\r\nyour people or something. I must not keep you, Mr. Vincent; you must go\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"Not till you have returned to the house; and given me your word of\r\nhonour," said Vincent, "not to escape, or to attempt to escape; or else\r\nI must tell her everything, or give you up into stronger hands. I will\r\nnot leave you here."\r\n\r\n"My word! but women are not bound by their honour; our honour means--not\r\nour word," cried Mrs. Hilyard, wildly; "my parole, he means; soldiers,\r\nand heroes, and men of honour give their parole; you don\'t exact it from\r\nwomen. Words are not kept to us, Mr. Vincent; do you expect us to keep\r\nthem? Yes, yes; I know I am talking wildly. Is it strange, do you think?\r\nBut what if I give you my word, and nobody sends me any further\r\nnews--nothing about my child? Women are only wild animals when their\r\nchildren are taken from them. I will forget it, and go away for\r\nnews--news! That is what I want. Escape!" she repeated, with a miserable\r\ncry; "who can escape? I do not understand what it means."\r\n\r\n"But you must not leave this house," said Vincent, firmly. "You\r\nunderstand what I mean. You must not leave Lady Western. Go with her\r\nwhere she pleases; but unless you promise on your honour to remain here,\r\nand with her, I shall be obliged----"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" she said, trembling--"hush! My honour!--and you still trust in\r\nit? I will promise," she continued, turning and looking anxiously round\r\ninto the dull winter daylight, as if calculating what chance she had of\r\nrushing away and eluding him. Then her eyes returned to the face of the\r\nyoung man, who stood firm and watchful beside her--agitated, yet so\r\nmuch stronger, calmer, even more resolute than she; then shrinking back,\r\nand keeping her eyes, with a kind of fascinated gaze, upon his face, she\r\nrepeated the words slowly, "I promise--upon my honour. I will not go\r\naway--escape, as you call it. If I should go mad, that will not matter.\r\nYes, ring the bell for me. You are the stronger now. I will obey you and\r\ngo back. You have taken a woman\'s parole, Mr. Vincent," she went on,\r\nwith a strange spasmodic shadow of that old movement of her mouth; "it\r\nwill be curious to note if she can keep it. Good-bye--good-bye." She\r\nspoke with a trembling desperation of calmness, mastering herself with\r\nall her power. She did not remove her eyes from his face till the door\r\nhad been opened. "I promise, on my honour," she repeated, with again a\r\ngleam of terror, as Vincent stood watching. Then the door closed,\r\nshutting in that tragic, wretched figure. She was gone back to her\r\nprison, with her misery, from which she could not escape. In that same\r\ngarden, Vincent, with the sharp eyes of love and despair, even while\r\nwatching her, had caught afar off a vision of two figures together,\r\nwalking slowly, one leaning on the other, with the lingering steps of\r\nhappiness. The sight went to his heart with a dull pang of certainty,\r\nwhich crushed down in a moment the useless effervescence of his former\r\nmood. His prisoner and he parted, going in and out, one scarcely less\r\nmiserable at that moment than the other. In full sight of them both\r\nlingered for the same moment these two in the tenderest blessedness of\r\nlife. Vincent turned sharp round, and went away the whole length of the\r\nlong road past St. Roque\'s, past the farthest village suburb of\r\nCarlingford, stifling his heart that it should say nothing. He had\r\nforgotten all about those duties which brought him there. Salem had\r\nvanished from his horizon. He saw nothing in heaven or earth but that\r\nmiserable woman going back to her prison, interwoven with the vision of\r\nthese two in their garden of paradise. The sight possessed him heart and\r\nspirit; he could not even feel that he felt it, his heart lying stifled\r\nin his bosom. It was, and there was no more to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VINCENT made many pilgrimages out of the sick-room that day; her\r\nmind was disturbed and restless; she could not keep still by Susan\'s\r\nside. She went and strayed through her son\'s rooms, looked at his books,\r\ngave a furtive glance at his linen; then went back and sat down for a\r\nlittle, until a renewed access of anxiety sent her wandering forth once\r\nmore. Then she heard him come in, and went out to see him. But he was\r\ngloomy and uncommunicative, evidently indisposed to satisfy her in any\r\nway, absorbed in his own thoughts. Mrs. Vincent came and sat by him\r\nwhile he dined, thinking, in her simplicity, that it would be a pleasure\r\nto Arthur. But Arthur, with the unsocial habits of a man accustomed to\r\nlive alone, had already set up a book before him while he ate, leaving\r\nhis mother to wonder by herself behind what was the world of unknown\r\nthought that rapt her son, and into which her wistful wonder could not\r\npenetrate. But the widow was wise in her generation: she would not worry\r\nhim with questions which it was very apparent beforehand that he did not\r\nmean to answer. She admitted to herself with a pang of mingled pain,\r\ncuriosity, and resignation, that Arthur was no longer a boy having no\r\nsecrets from his mother. Once more the little woman looked at the\r\nunreasonable male creature shut up within itself, and decided, with a\r\nfeminine mixture of pity and awe, that it must be allowed to take its\r\nown time and way of disclosing itself, and that to torture it into\r\npremature utterance would be foolish, not to say impracticable. She left\r\nhim, accordingly, to himself, and went away again, returning, however,\r\nere long, in her vague restlessness, as she had been doing all day. The\r\nearly winter evening had closed in, and the lamp was lighted--the same\r\nlamp which had smoked and annoyed Mrs. Vincent\'s nice perceptions the\r\nfirst evening she was in Carlingford. Vincent had thrown himself on a\r\nsofa with a book, not to read, but as a disguise under which he could\r\nindulge his own thoughts, when his mother came quietly back into the\r\nroom. Mrs. Vincent thought it looked dark and less cheerful than it\r\nought. She poked the fire softly not to disturb Arthur, and made it\r\nblaze. Then she turned to the lamp, which flared huskily upon the table.\r\n"It smokes more than ever," said Mrs. Vincent, half apologetically, in\r\ncase Arthur should observe her proceedings as she took off the globe.\r\nHe, as was natural, put down his book and gazed at her with a certain\r\nimpatient wonder, half contemptuous of that strange female development\r\nwhich amid all troubles could carry through, from one crisis of life to\r\nanother, that miraculous trifling, and concern itself about the smoking\r\nof a lamp. As she screwed it up and down and adjusted the wick, with the\r\nsmoky light flaring upon her anxious face, and magnifying the shadow of\r\nher little figure against the wall behind, her son looked on with a\r\nfeeling very similar to that which had moved Mrs. Vincent when she\r\nwatched him eating his dinner with his book set up before him. These\r\nwere points upon which the mother and son could not understand each\r\nother. But the sight disturbed his thoughts and touched his temper; he\r\ngot up from the sofa and threw down his unread book.\r\n\r\n"You women are incomprehensible," said the young man, with an irritation\r\nhe could not subdue--"what does it matter about the lamp? but if the\r\nworld were going to pieces you must still be intent upon such\r\ntrifles--leave that to the people of the house."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, the people of the house don\'t understand it," said Mrs.\r\nVincent. "Oh Arthur, it is often the trifles that are the most\r\nimportant. I have had Mrs. Tozer calling upon me to-day, and Mrs.\r\nTufton. I don\'t wonder, dear, if you find them a little tiresome; but\r\nthat is what every pastor has to expect. I daresay you have been worried\r\nto-day paying so many visits. Hush, there is some one coming up-stairs.\r\nIt is Mr. Tozer, Arthur. I can hear his voice."\r\n\r\nUpon which the minister, conscious of not being prepared for Tozer\'s\r\nquestions, gave vent to an impatient ejaculation. "Never a moment\'s\r\nrespite! And now I shall have to give an account of myself," said the\r\nunfortunate Nonconformist. Mrs. Vincent, who had just then finished her\r\noperations with the lamp, looked up reproachfully over the light at her\r\nson.\r\n\r\n"Oh Arthur, consider how kind he has been! Your dear father would never\r\nhave used such an expression--but you have my quick temper," said the\r\nwidow, with a little sigh. She shook hands very cordially with the good\r\nbutterman when he made his appearance. "I was just going to make tea for\r\nmy son," said Mrs. Vincent. "I have scarcely been able to sit with him\r\nat all since Susan took ill. Arthur, ring the bell--it is so kind of you\r\nto come; you will take a cup of tea with us while my son and you talk\r\nmatters over--that is, if you don\'t object to my presence?" said the\r\nminister\'s mother with a smile. "Your dear papa always liked me to be\r\nwith him, Arthur; and until he has a wife, Mr. Tozer, I daresay his\r\nmother will not be much in the way when it is so kind a friend as you he\r\nhas to talk over his business with. Bring tea directly, please. I fear\r\nyou have forgotten what I said to you about the lamp, which burns quite\r\nnicely when you take a little pains. Arthur, will you open the window to\r\nclear the atmosphere of that smoke? and perhaps Mr. Tozer will take a\r\nseat nearer the fire."\r\n\r\n"I am obliged to you, ma\'am," said the butterman, who had a cloud on his\r\nface. "Not no nearer, thank you all the same. If I hadn\'t thought you\'d\r\nhave done tea, I shouldn\'t have come troubling Mr. Vincent, not so\r\nsoon;" and Tozer turned a doubtful glance towards the minister, who\r\nstood longer at the window than he need have done. The widow\'s\r\nexperienced eye saw that some irritation had risen between her son and\r\nhis friend and patron. Tozer was suspicious, and ready to take\r\noffence-- Arthur, alas! in an excited and restless mood, only too ready\r\nto give it. His mother could read in his shoulders, as he stood at the\r\nwindow with his back to her, that impulse to throw off the yoke and\r\nresent the inquisition to which he was subject, which, all conscious as\r\nhe was of not having carried out Tozer\'s injunctions, seized upon the\r\nunfortunate Nonconformist. With a little tremulous rush, Mrs. Vincent\r\nput herself in the breach.\r\n\r\n"I am sure so warm a friend as Mr. Tozer can never trouble any of my\r\nfamily at any time," said the widow, with a little effusion. "I know too\r\nwell how rare a thing real kindness is--and I am very glad you have come\r\njust now while I can be here," she added, with a sensation of\r\nthankfulness perhaps not so complimentary to Tozer as it looked on the\r\nsurface. "Arthur, dear, I think that will do now. You may put up the\r\nwindow and come back to your chair. You don\'t smell the lamp, Mr. Tozer?\r\nand here is the little maid with the tea."\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent moved about the tray almost in a bustle when the girl had\r\nplaced it on the table. She re-arranged all the cups and moved\r\neverything on the table, while her son took up a gloomy position behind\r\nher on the hearthrug, and Tozer preserved an aspect of ominous civility\r\non the other side of the table. She was glad that the little maid had to\r\nreturn two or three times with various forgotten adjuncts, though even\r\nthen Mrs. Vincent\'s instincts of good management prompted her to point\r\nout to the handmaiden the disadvantages of her thoughtlessness. "If you\r\nhad but taken time to think what would be wanted, you would have saved\r\nyourself a great deal of trouble," said the minister\'s mother, with a\r\ntremble of expectation thrilling her frame, looking wistfully round to\r\nsee whether anything more was wanted, or if, perhaps, another minute\r\nmight be gained before the storm broke. She gave Arthur a look of\r\nentreaty as she called him forward to take his place at table. She knew\r\nthat real kindness was not very often to be met with in this\r\ncross-grained world; and if people are conscious of having been kind, it\r\nis only natural they should expect gratitude! Such was the sentiment in\r\nher eyes as she turned round and fixed them upon her son. "Tea is ready,\r\nArthur," said the widow, in a tone of secret supplication. And Arthur\r\nunderstood his mother, and was less and less inclined to conciliate as\r\nhe came forward out of the darkness, where he might look sulky if he\r\npleased, and sat down full in the light of the lamp, which smoked no\r\nlonger. They were not a comfortable party. Mrs. Vincent felt it so\r\nnecessary that she should talk and keep them separated, that she lost\r\nher usual self-command, and subjects failed her in her utmost need.\r\n\r\n"Let me give you another cup of tea," she said, as the butterman paused\r\nin the supernumerary meal which that excellent man was making; "I am so\r\nglad you happened to come this evening when I am taking a little\r\nleisure. I hope the congregation will not think me indifferent, Mr.\r\nTozer. I am sure you and Mrs. Tozer will kindly explain to them how much\r\nI have been occupied. When Susan is well, I hope to make acquaintance\r\nwith all my son\'s people. Arthur, my dear boy, you are over-tired, you\r\ndon\'t eat anything--and you made a very poor dinner. I wish you would\r\nadvise him to take a little rest, Mr. Tozer. He minds his mother in most\r\nthings, but not in this. It is vain for me to say anything to him about\r\ngiving up work; but perhaps a little advice from you would have more\r\neffect. I spoke to Dr. Rider on the subject, and he says a little rest\r\nis all my son requires; but rest is exactly what he will never take. It\r\nwas just the same with his dear father--and you are not strong enough,\r\nArthur, to bear so much."\r\n\r\n"I daresay as you\'re right, ma\'am," said Tozer; "if he was to take a\r\nlittle more exercise and walking about--most of us Salem folks wouldn\'t\r\nmind a little less on Sundays, to have more of the minister at other\r\ntimes. I hope as there wasn\'t no unpleasantness, Mr. Vincent, between\r\nyou and Pigeon when you see him to-day?"\r\n\r\n"I did not see him;--I mean I am sorry I was not able to call on Pigeon\r\nto-day," said Vincent, hastily; "I was unexpectedly detained," he added,\r\ngrowing rather red, and looking Tozer in the face. "Indeed, I am not\r\nsure that I ought to call on Pigeon," continued the minister, after a\r\npause; "I have done nothing to offend him. If he chooses to take an\r\naffront which was never intended, I can\'t help it. Why should I go and\r\ncourt every man who is sulky or ill-tempered in the congregation? Look\r\nhere, Tozer--you are a sensible man--you have been very kind, as my\r\nmother says. I set out to-day intending to go and see this man for your\r\nsake; but you know very well this is not what I came to Carlingford\r\nfor. If I had known the sort of thing that was required of me!" cried\r\nVincent, rising up and resuming his place on the hearthrug--"to go with\r\nmy hat in my hand, and beg this one and the other to forgive me, and\r\nreceive me into favour:--why, what have I ever done to Pigeon? if he has\r\nanything to find fault with, he had much better come to me, and have it\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent, sir," said Tozer solemnly, pushing away his empty teacup,\r\nand leaning forward over the table on his folded arms, "them ain\'t the\r\nsentiments for a pastor in our connection. That\'s a style of thing as\r\nmay do among fine folks, or in the church where there\'s no freedom; but\r\nthem as chooses their own pastor, and pays their own pastor, and don\'t\r\nspare no pains to make him comfortable, has a right to expect different.\r\nThem ain\'t the sentiments, sir, for Salem folks. I don\'t say if they\'re\r\nwrong or right-- I don\'t make myself a judge of no man; but I\'ve seen a\r\ndeal of our connection and human nature in general, and this I know,\r\nthat a minister as has to please his flock, has got to please his flock\r\nwhatever happens, and neither me nor no other man can make it different;\r\nand that Mrs. Vincent, as has seen life, can tell you as well as I can.\r\nPigeon ain\'t neither here nor there. It\'s the flock as has to be\r\nconsidered--and it ain\'t preaching alone as will do that; and that your\r\ngood mother, sir, as knows the world, will tell you as well as me."\r\n\r\n"But Arthur is well aware of it," said the alarmed mother, interposing\r\nhastily, conscious that to be thus appealed to was the greatest danger\r\nwhich could threaten her. "His dear father always told him so; yet,\r\nafter all, Mr. Vincent used to say," added the anxious diplomatist,\r\n"that nothing was to be depended on in the end but the pulpit. I have\r\nheard him talking of it with the leading people in the connection, Mr.\r\nTozer. They all used to say that, though visiting was very good, and a\r\npastor\'s duty, it was the pulpit, after all, that was to be most trusted\r\nto; and I have always seen in my experience--I don\'t know if the same\r\nhas occurred to you--that both gifts are very rarely to be met with. Of\r\ncourse, we should all strive after perfection," continued the minister\'s\r\nmother, with a tremulous smile--"but it is so seldom met with that any\r\none has both gifts! Arthur, my dear boy, I wish you would eat something;\r\nand Mr. Tozer, let me give you another cup of tea."\r\n\r\n"No more for me, ma\'am, thankye," said Tozer, laying his hand over his\r\ncup. "I don\'t deny as there\'s truth in what you say. I don\'t deny as a\r\nfamily here and there in a flock may be aggravating like them Pigeons,\r\nI\'m not the man to be hard on a minister, if that ain\'t his turn. A\r\npastor may have a weakness, and not feel himself as equal to one part of\r\nhis work as to another; but to go for to say as visiting and keeping the\r\nflock pleased, ain\'t his duty--it\'s that, ma\'am, as goes to my heart."\r\n\r\nTozer\'s pathos touched a lighter chord in the bosom of the minister. He\r\ncame back to his seat with a passing sense of amusement. "If Pigeon has\r\nanything to find fault with, let him come and have it out," said\r\nVincent, bringing, as his mother instantly perceived, a less clouded\r\ncountenance into the light of the lamp. "You, who are a much better\r\njudge than Pigeon, were not displeased on Sunday," added the minister,\r\nnot without a certain complacency. Looking back upon the performances of\r\nthat day, the young Nonconformist himself was not displeased. He knew\r\nnow--though he was unconscious at the time--that he had made a great\r\nappearance in the pulpit of Salem, and that once more the eyes of\r\nCarlingford, unused to oratory, and still more unused to great and\r\npassionate emotion, were turned upon him.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, if it come to be a question of that," said the mollified\r\ndeacon; "but no--it ain\'t that--I can\'t, whatever my feelings is, be\r\nforgetful of my dooty!" cried Tozer, in sudden excitement. "It ain\'t\r\nthat, Mr. Vincent; it\'s for your good I\'m a-speaking up and letting you\r\nknow my mind. It ain\'t the pulpit, sir. I\'ll not say as I ever had a\r\nword to say against your sermons: but when the minister goes out of my\r\nhouse, a-saying as he\'s going to visit the flock, and when he\'s to be\r\nseen the next moment, Mrs. Vincent, not going to the flock, but\r\na-spending his precious time in Grange Lane with them as don\'t know\r\nnothing, and don\'t care nothing for Salem, nor understand the ways of\r\nfolks like us----"\r\n\r\nHere Tozer was interrupted suddenly by the minister, who once more rose\r\nfrom his chair with an angry exclamation. What he might have said in the\r\nhasty impulse of the moment nobody could tell; but Mrs. Vincent, hastily\r\nstumbling up on her part from her chair, burst in with a tremulous\r\nvoice--\r\n\r\n"Arthur, my dear boy! did you hear Susan call me?--hark! I fancied I\r\nheard her voice. Oh, Arthur dear, go and see, I am too weak to run\r\nmyself. Say I am coming directly--hark! do you think it is Susan? Oh,\r\nArthur, go and see!"\r\n\r\nStartled by her earnestness, though declaring he heard nothing, the\r\nyoung man hastened away. Mrs. Vincent seized her opportunity without\r\nloss of time.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tozer," said the widow, "I am just going to my sick child. Arthur\r\nand you will be able to talk of your business more freely when I am\r\ngone, and I hope you will be guided to give him good advice; what I am\r\nafraid of is, that he will throw it all up," continued Mrs. Vincent,\r\nleaning her hand upon the table, and bending forward confidential and\r\nsolemn to the startled butterman, "as so many talented young men in our\r\nconnection do nowadays. Young men are so difficult to deal with; they\r\nwill not put up with things that we know must be put up with," said the\r\nminister\'s mother, shaking her head with a sigh. "That is how we are\r\nlosing all our young preachers;--an accomplished young man has so many\r\nways of getting on now. Oh, Mr. Tozer, I rely upon you to give my son\r\ngood advice--if he is aggravated, it is my terror that he will throw it\r\nall up! Good-night. You have been our kind friend, and I have such trust\r\nin you!" Saying which the widow shook hands with him earnestly and went\r\naway, leaving the worthy deacon much shaken, and with a weight of\r\nresponsibility upon him. Vincent met her at the door, assuring her that\r\nSusan had not called; but with a heroism which nobody suspected--trembling\r\nwith anxiety, yet conscious of having struck a master-stroke--his mother\r\nglided away to the stillness of the sick-room, where she sat questioning\r\nher own wisdom all the evening after, and wondering whether, after all,\r\nat such a crisis, she had done right to come away.\r\n\r\nWhen the minister and the deacon were left alone together, instead of\r\nreturning with zest to their interrupted discussion, neither of them\r\nsaid anything for some minutes. Once more Vincent took up his position\r\non the hearthrug, and Tozer gazed ruefully at the empty cup which he\r\nstill covered with his hand, full of troubled thoughts. The\r\nresponsibility was almost too much for Tozer. He could scarcely realise\r\nto himself what terrors lay involved in that threatened danger, or what\r\nmight happen if the minister threw it all up! He held his breath at the\r\nawful thought. The widow\'s Parthian arrow had gone straight to the\r\nbutterman\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I hope, sir, as you won\'t think there\'s anything but an anxious feelin\'\r\nin the flock to do you justice as our pastor," said Tozer, with a\r\ncertain solemnity, "or that we ain\'t sensible of our blessin\'s. I\'ve\r\nsaid both to yourself and others, as you was a young man of great\r\npromise, and as good a preacher as I ever see in our connection, Mr.\r\nVincent, and I\'ll stand by what I\'ve said; but you ain\'t above taking a\r\nfriend\'s advice--not speaking with no authority," added the good\r\nbutterman, in a conciliatory tone; "it\'s all along of the women,\r\nsir--it\'s them as is at the bottom of all the mischief in a flock. It\r\nain\'t Pigeon, bless you, as is to blame. And even my missis, though\r\nshe\'s not to say unreasonable as women go--none of them can abide to\r\nhear of you a-going after Lady Western--that\'s it, Mr. Vincent. She\'s a\r\nlovely creature," cried Tozer, with enthusiasm; "there ain\'t one in\r\nCarlingford to compare with her, as I can see, and I wouldn\'t be the one\r\nto blame a young man as was carried away. But there couldn\'t no good\r\ncome of it, and Salem folks is touchy and jealous," continued the worthy\r\ndeacon; "that was all as I meant to say."\r\n\r\nThus the conference ended amicably after a little more talk, in which\r\nPigeon and the other malcontents were made a sacrifice of and given up\r\nby the anxious butterman, upon whom Mrs. Vincent\'s parting words had\r\nmade so deep an impression. Tozer went home thereafter to overawe his\r\nangry wife, whom Vincent\'s visit to Lady Western had utterly\r\nexasperated, with the dread responsibility now laid upon them. "What if\r\nhe was to throw it all up!" said Tozer. That alarming possibility struck\r\nsilence and dismay to the very heart of the household. Perhaps it was\r\nthe dawn of a new era of affairs in Salem. The deacon\'s very sleep was\r\ndisturbed by recollections of the promising young men who, now he came\r\nto think of it, had been lost to the connection, as Mrs. Vincent\r\nsuggested, and had thrown it all up. The fate of the chapel, and all the\r\nnew sittings let under the ministry of the young Nonconformist, seemed\r\nto hang on Tozer\'s hands. He thought of the weekly crowd, and his heart\r\nstirred. Not many deacons in the connection could boast of being crowded\r\nout of their own pews Sunday after Sunday by the influx of unexpected\r\nhearers. The enlightenment of Carlingford, as well as the filling of the\r\nchapel, was at stake. Clearly, in the history of Salem, a new era had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT week passed on without much incident. To Vincent and his mother, in\r\nwhose history days had, for some time past, been counting like years, it\r\nmight have seemed a very grateful pause, but for the thunderous\r\natmosphere of doubt and uncertainty which clouded over them on every\r\nside. Susan\'s recovery did not progress; and Dr. Rider began to look as\r\nserious over her utter languor and apathy, which nothing seemed able to\r\ndisturb, as he had done at her delirium. The Salem people stood aloof,\r\nas Mrs. Vincent perceived, with keen feminine observation. She could not\r\npersuade herself, as she had tried to persuade Mrs. Tozer, that the\r\nlandlady answered inquiries at the door by way of leaving the sick-room\r\nquiet. The fact was, that except Lady Western\'s fine footman, the sight\r\nof whom at the minister\'s door was far from desirable, nobody came to\r\nmake inquiries except Mrs. Tufton and Phoebe Tozer, the latter of whom\r\nfound no encouragement in her visits. Politic on all other points, the\r\nwidow could not deny herself, when circumstances put it in her power to\r\nextinguish Phoebe. Mrs. Vincent would not have harmed a fly, but it\r\ngave her a certain pleasure to wound the rash female bosom which had, as\r\nshe supposed, formed plans of securing her son. As for Tozer himself,\r\nhis visits had almost ceased. He was scarcely to be seen even in the\r\nshop, into which sometimes the minister himself gazed disconsolately\r\nwhen he strayed out in the twilight to walk his cares away. The good\r\nbutterman was otherwise employed. He was wrestling with Pigeon in many a\r\nclose encounter, holding little committees in the back parlour. On his\r\nsingle arm and strength he felt it now to depend whether or not the\r\npastor could tide it over, and be pulled through.\r\n\r\nAs for Vincent himself, he had retired from the conflict. He paid no\r\nvisits; with a certain half-conscious falling back upon the one thing he\r\ncould do best, he devoted himself to his sermons. At least he shut\r\nhimself up to write morning after morning, and remained all day dull and\r\nundisturbed, brooding over his work. The congregation somehow got to\r\nhear of his abstraction. And to the offended mind of Salem there was\r\nsomething imposing in the idea of the minister, misunderstood and\r\nunappreciated, thus retiring from the field, and devoting himself to\r\n"study." Even Mrs. Pigeon owned to herself a certain respect for the foe\r\nwho did not humble himself, but withdrew with dignity into the\r\nintrenchments of his own position. It was fine; but it was not the thing\r\nfor Salem. Mrs. Brown had a tea-party on the Thursday, to which the\r\npastor was not even invited, but where there were great and manifold\r\ndiscussions about him, and where the Tozers found themselves an angry\r\nminority, suspected on all sides. "A pastor as makes himself agreeable\r\nhere and there, but don\'t take no thought for the good of the flock in\r\ngeneral, ain\'t a man to get on in our connection," said Mrs. Pigeon,\r\nwith a toss of her head at Phoebe, who blushed over all her pink arms\r\nand shoulders with mingled gratification and discomposure. Mrs. Tozer\r\nherself received this insinuation without any violent disclaimer. "For\r\nmy part, I can\'t say as the minister hasn\'t made himself very agreeable\r\nas far as we are concerned," said that judicious woman. "It\'s well known\r\nas friends can\'t come amiss to Tozer and me. Dinner or supper, we never\r\ncan be took wrong, not being fine folks but comfortable," said the\r\nbutterman\'s wife, directing her eyes visibly to Mrs. Pigeon, who was not\r\nunderstood to be liberal in her house-keeping. Poor Phoebe was not so\r\ndiscriminating. When she retired into a corner with her companions,\r\nPhoebe\'s injured feelings disclosed themselves. "I am sure he never\r\nsaid anything to me that he might not have said to any one," she\r\nconfessed to Maria Pigeon; "it is very hard to have people look so at me\r\nwhen perhaps he means nothing at all," said Phoebe, half dejected,\r\nhalf important. Mrs. Pigeon heard the unguarded confession, and made use\r\nof it promptly, not careful for her consistency.\r\n\r\n"I said when you had all set your hearts on a young man, that it was a\r\nfoolish thing to do," said poor Vincent\'s skilful opponent; "I said he\'d\r\nbe sure to come a-dangling about our houses, and a-trifling with the\r\naffections of our girls. It\'ll be well if it doesn\'t come too true; not\r\nas I want to pretend to be wiser nor other folks--but I said so, as\r\nyou\'ll remember, Mrs. Brown, the very first day Mr. Vincent preached in\r\nSalem. I said, \'He\'s not bad-looking, and he\'s young and has genteel\r\nways, and the girls don\'t know no better. You mark my words, if he don\'t\r\nmake some mischief in Carlingford afore all\'s done,\'--and I only hope as\r\nit won\'t come too true."\r\n\r\n"Them as is used to giddy girls gets timid, as is natural," said Mrs.\r\nTozer; "it\'s different where there is only one, and she a quiet one. I\r\ncan\'t say as I ever thought a young man was more taking for being a\r\nminister; but there can\'t be no doubt as it must be harder upon you,\r\nma\'am, as has four daughters, than me as has only one--and she a quiet\r\none," added the deacon\'s wife, with a glance of maternal pride at\r\nPhoebe, who was just then enfolding the spare form of Maria Pigeon in\r\nan artless embrace, and who looked in her pink wreath and white muslin\r\ndress, "quite the lady," at least in her mother\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"The quiet ones is the deep ones," said Tozer, interfering, as a wise\r\nman ought, in the female duel, as it began to get intense. "Phoebe\'s\r\nmy girl, and I don\'t deny being fond of her, as is natural; but she\r\nain\'t so innocent as not to know how things is working, and what meaning\r\nis in some folks\' minds. But that\'s neither here nor there, and it\'s\r\ntime as we was going away."\r\n\r\n"Not before we\'ve had prayers," said Mrs. Brown. "I was surprised the\r\nfirst time I see Mr. Vincent in your house, Mr. Tozer, as we all parted\r\nlike heathens without a blessing, specially being all chapel folks, and\r\nof one way of thinking. Our ways is different in this house; and though\r\nwe\'re in a comfortless kind of condition, and no better than if we\r\nhadn\'t no minister, still as there\'s you and Mr. Pigeon here----"\r\n\r\nThe tea-party thus concluded with a still more distinct sense of the\r\npastor\'s shortcomings. There was nobody to "give prayers" but Pigeon and\r\nTozer. For all social purposes, the flock in Salem might as well have\r\nhad no minister. The next little committee held in the back parlour at\r\nthe butter-shop was still more unsatisfactory. While it was in progress,\r\nMr. Vincent himself appeared, and had to be taken solemnly up-stairs to\r\nthe drawing-room, where there was no fire, and where the hum of the\r\nvoices below was very audible, as Mrs. Tozer and Phoebe, getting blue\r\nwith cold, sat vainly trying to occupy the attention of the pastor.\r\n\r\n"Pa has some business people with him in the parlour," explained\r\nPhoebe, who was very tender and sympathetic, as might be expected; but\r\nit did not require a very brilliant intelligence to divine that the\r\nbusiness under discussion was the minister, even if Mrs. Tozer\'s\r\nsolemnity, and the anxious care with which he was conveyed past the\r\nclosed door of the parlour, had not already filled the mind of the\r\npastor with suspicion.\r\n\r\n"Go down and let your pa know as Mr. Vincent\'s here," said Mrs. Tozer,\r\nafter this uncomfortable s\xe9ance had lasted half an hour; "and he\'s not\r\nto keep them men no longer than he can help; and presently we\'ll have a\r\nbit of supper--that\'s what I enjoy, that is, Mr. Vincent; no ceremony\r\nlike there must be at a party, but just to take us as we are; and we\r\ncan\'t be took amiss, Tozer and me. There\'s always a bit of something\r\ncomfortable for supper; and no friend as could be made so welcome as the\r\nminister," added the good woman, growing more and more civil as she came\r\nto her wits\' end; for had not Pigeon and Brown been asked to share that\r\nsomething comfortable? For the first time it was a relief to the\r\nbutterman\'s household when the pastor declined the impromptu invitation,\r\nand went resolutely away. His ears, sharpened by suspicion, recognised\r\nthe familiar voices in the parlour, where the door was ajar when he went\r\nout again. Vincent could not have imagined that to feel himself\r\nunwelcome at Tozer\'s would have had any effect whatever upon his\r\npreoccupied mind, or that to pass almost within hearing of one of the\r\ndiscussions which must inevitably be going on about him among the\r\nmanagers of Salem, could quicken his pulse or disturb his composure. But\r\nit was so notwithstanding. He had come out at the entreaty of his\r\nmother, half unwillingly, anticipating, with the liveliest realisation\r\nof all its attendant circumstances, an evening spent at that big table\r\nin the back parlour, and something comfortable to supper. He came back\r\nagain tingling with curiosity, indignation, and suppressed defiance. The\r\nsomething comfortable had not this time been prepared for him. He was\r\nbeing discussed, not entertained, in the parlour; and Mrs. Tozer and\r\nPhoebe, in the chill fine drawing-room up-stairs, where the gas was\r\nblazing in a vain attempt to make up for the want of the fire--shivering\r\nwith cold and civility--had been as much disconcerted by his appearance\r\nas if they too were plotting against him. Mr. Vincent returned to his\r\nsermon not without some additional fire. He had spent a great deal of\r\ntime over his sermon that week; it was rather learned and very\r\nelaborate, and a little--dull. The poor minister felt very conscious of\r\nthe fact, but could not help it. He was tempted to put it in the fire,\r\nand begin again, when he returned that Friday evening, smarting with\r\nthose little stinging arrows of slight and injury; but it was too late:\r\nand this was the beginning of the "coorse" which Tozer had laid so much\r\nstore by. Vincent concluded the elaborate production by a few sharp\r\nsentences, which he was perfectly well aware did not redeem it, and\r\nexplained to his mother, with a little ill-temper, as she thought, that\r\nhe had changed his mind about visiting the Tozers that night. Mrs.\r\nVincent did Arthur injustice as she returned to Susan\'s room, where\r\nagain matters looked very sadly; and so the troubled week came to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY! It came again, the inevitable morning. There are pathetic\r\nstories current in the world about most of the other professions that\r\nclaim the ear of the public; how lawyers prepare great speeches, which\r\nare to open for them the gates of the future, in the midst of the\r\nkilling anxieties of life and poverty--how mimes and players of all\r\ndescriptions keep the world in laughter while their hearts are breaking.\r\nBut few people think of the sufferings of the priest, whom, let trouble\r\nor anxiety come as they please, necessity will have in the inexorable\r\npulpit Sunday after Sunday. So Vincent thought as he put on his Geneva\r\ngown in his little vestry, with the raw February air coming in at the\r\nopen window, and his sermon, which was dull, lying on the table beside\r\nhim. It was dull--he knew it in his heart; but after all the strain of\r\npassion he had been held at, what was to preserve him any more than\r\nanother from the unavoidable lassitude and blank that followed? Still it\r\nwas not agreeable to know that Salem was crowded to the door, and that\r\nthis sermon, upon which the minister looked ruefully, was laboured and\r\nfeeble, without any divine spark to enlighten it, or power to touch the\r\nhearts of other men. The consciousness that it was dull would, the\r\npreacher knew, make it duller still--its heaviness would affect himself\r\nas well as his audience. Still that was not to be helped now, there it\r\nlay, ready for utterance; and here in his Geneva gown, with the sound in\r\nhis ears of all the stream of entering worshippers who were then\r\narranging themselves in the pews of Salem, stood the minister prepared\r\nto speak. There was, as Vincent divined, a great crowd--so great a crowd\r\nthat various groups stood during the whole service, which, by dint of\r\nbeing more laboured and feeble than usual, was longer too. With a\r\ncertain dulness of feeling, half despairing, the minister accomplished\r\nthe preliminary devotions, and was just opening his Bible to begin the\r\nwork of the day when his startled eye caught a most unlooked-for\r\naccession to the flock. Immediately before him, in the same pew with\r\nMrs. Tozer and Phoebe, what was that beautiful vision that struck him\r\ndumb for the moment? Tozer himself had brought her in during the\r\nprayers, through the groups that occupied the passage, to his own seat,\r\nwhere she sat expanding her rustling plumage, and looking round with all\r\nher natural sweetness, and a kind of delightful unconscious patronage\r\nand curiosity, upon the crowd of unknown people who were nobody in\r\nCarlingford. The sight of her struck the young Nonconformist dumb. He\r\ntook some moments to recover himself, ere, with a pang in his heart, he\r\nbegan his dull sermon. It mattered nothing to Lady Western what kind of\r\na sermon he preached. She was not clever, and probably would never know\r\nthe difference; but it went to the young man\'s heart, an additional pang\r\nof humiliation, to think that it was not his best he had to set before\r\nthat unexpected hearer. What had brought the beauty here? Vincent\'s\r\ndazzled eyes did not make out for some time the dark spare figure beside\r\nher, all sunned over with the rays of her splendour. Mrs. Tozer and\r\nPhoebe on one side, proud yet half affronted, contemplating with awe\r\nand keen observation the various particulars of Lady Western\'s dress,\r\nwere not more unlike her, reposing in her soft beauty within the hard\r\nwooden enclosure of the pew, beaming upon everybody in sweet ease and\r\ncomposure--than was the agitated restless face, with gleaming uncertain\r\neyes that flashed everywhere, which appeared at her other side when\r\nVincent came to be able to see. He preached his sermon with a certain\r\nself-disgust growing more and more intense every time he ventured to\r\nglance at that strange line of faces. The only attentive hearer in\r\nTozer\'s pew was Lady Western, who looked up at the young minister\r\nsteadily with her sweet eyes, and listened with all the gracious\r\npropriety that belonged to her. The Tozers, for their part, drawn up in\r\ntheir end of the seat, gave a very divided attention, being chiefly\r\noccupied with Lady Western; and as for Mrs. Hilyard, the sight of her\r\nrestlessness and nervous agitation would have been pitiful had anybody\r\nthere been sufficiently interested to observe it. Mr. Vincent\'s sermon\r\ncertainly did not secure that wandering mind. All her composure had\r\ndeserted this strange woman. Now and then she almost rose up by way\r\napparently of relieving the restless fever that possessed her; her\r\nnervous hands wandered among the books of the Tozer pew with an\r\nincessant motion. Her eyes gleamed in all directions with a wistful\r\nanxiety and suspicion. All this went on while Vincent preached his\r\nsermon; he had no eyes for the other people in the place. Now and then\r\nthe young man became rhetorical, and threw in here and there a wild\r\nflourish to break the deadness of his discourse, with no success as he\r\nsaw. He read tedium in all the lines of faces before him as he came to a\r\nclose with a dull despair--in all the faces except that sweet face never\r\ndisturbed out of its lovely calm of attention, which would have listened\r\nto the Dissenting minister quite as calmly had he preached like Paul.\r\nWith a sensation that this was one of the critical moments of his fate,\r\nand that he had failed in it, Vincent dropped into his seat in\r\nexhaustion and self-disgust, while his hearers got up to sing their\r\nhymn. It was at this moment that Tozer walked up through the aisle,\r\nsteadily, yet with his heart beating louder than usual, and ascended the\r\npulpit-stairs to give forth that intimation which had been agreed upon\r\nin the back parlour on Friday. The minister was disturbed in his\r\nuncomfortable repose by the entrance of the deacon into the pulpit,\r\nwhere the worthy butterman seated himself by Vincent\'s side. The\r\nunconscious congregation sang its hymn, while the Nonconformist, rousing\r\nup, looked with surprised eyes upon his unexpected companion; yet there\r\nwere bosoms in the flock which owned a thrill of emotion as Tozer\'s\r\nsubstantial person partially disappeared from view behind the crimson\r\ncushion. Phoebe left off singing, and subsided into tears and her\r\nseat. Mrs. Pigeon lifted up her voice and expanded her person;\r\nmeanwhile Tozer whispered ominously, with a certain agitation, in his\r\npastor\'s ear--\r\n\r\n"It\'s three words of an intimation as I\'d like to give--nothing of no\r\nimportance; a meeting of the flock as some of us would like to call, if\r\nit\'s quite agreeable--nothing as you need mind, Mr. Vincent. We wouldn\'t\r\ngo for to occupy your time, sir, attending of it. There wasn\'t no\r\nopportunity to tell you before. I\'ll give it out, if it\'s agreeable,"\r\nsaid Tozer, with hesitation--"or if you\'d rather----"\r\n\r\n"Give it to me," said the minister quickly. He took the paper out of the\r\nbutterman\'s hand, who drew back uncomfortable and embarrassed, wishing\r\nhimself anywhere in the world but in the pulpit, from which that\r\nrevolutionary document menaced the startled pastor with summary\r\ndeposition. It was a sufficiently simple notice of a meeting to be held\r\non the following Monday evening, in the schoolroom, which was the scene\r\nof all the tea and other meetings of Salem. This, however, was no\r\ntea-meeting. Vincent drew his breath hard, and changed colour, as he\r\nbent down under the shadow of the pulpit-cushion and the big Bible, and\r\nread this dangerous document. Meanwhile the flock sang their hymn, to\r\nwhich Tozer, much discomposed, added a few broken notes of tremulous\r\nbass as he sat by the minister\'s side. When Mr. Vincent again raised his\r\nhead, and sat erect with the notice in his hand, the troubled deacon\r\nmade vain attempts to catch his eye, and ask what was to be done. The\r\nNonconformist made no reply to these telegraphic communications. When\r\nthe sinking was ended he rose, still with the paper in his hand, and\r\nfaced the congregation, where he no longer saw one face with a vague\r\nbackground of innumerable other faces, but had suddenly woke up to\r\nbehold his battle-ground and field of warfare, in which everything dear\r\nto him was suddenly assailed. Unawares the assembled people, who had\r\nreceived no special sensation from the sermon, woke up also at the sight\r\nof Vincent\'s face. He read the notice to them with a voice that tingled\r\nthrough the place; then he paused. "This meeting is one of which I have\r\nnot been informed," said Vincent. "It is one which I am not asked to\r\nattend. I invite you to it, all who are here present; and I invite you\r\nthereafter," continued the minister, with an unconscious elevation of\r\nhis head, "to meet me on the following evening to hear what I have to\r\nsay to you. Probably the business will be much the same on both\r\noccasions, but it will be approached from different sides of the\r\nquestion. I invite you to meet on Monday, according to this notice; and\r\nI invite you on Tuesday, at the same place and hour, to meet me."\r\n\r\nVincent did not hear the audible hum and buzz of surprise and excitement\r\nwhich ran through his startled flock. He did not pay much attention to\r\nwhat Tozer said to him when all was over. He lingered in his vestry,\r\ntaking off his gown, until he could hear Lady Western\'s carriage drive\r\noff after an interval of lingering. The young Dowager had gone out\r\nslowly, thinking to see him, and comfort him with a compliment about his\r\nsermon, concerning the quality of which she was not critical. She was\r\nsorry in her kind heart to perceive his troubled looks, and to discover\r\nthat somehow, she could not quite understand how, something annoying and\r\nunexpected had occurred to him. And then this uneasy companion, to whom\r\nhe had bound her, and whose strange agitation and wonderful change of\r\naspect Lady Western could in no way account for-- But the carriage rolled\r\naway at last, not without reluctance, while the minister still remained\r\nin his vestry. Then he hurried home, speaking to no one. Mrs. Vincent\r\ndid not understand her son all day, nor even next morning, when he might\r\nhave been supposed to have time to calm down. He was very silent, but no\r\nlonger dreamy or languid, or lost in the vague discontent and dejection\r\nwith which she was familiar. On the contrary, the minister had woke up\r\nout of that abstraction. He was wonderfully alert, open-eyed, full of\r\noccupation. When he sat down to his writing-table it was not to muse,\r\nwith his pen in his languid fingers, now and then putting down a\r\nsentence, but to write straight forward with evident fire and emphasis.\r\nHe was very tender to herself, but he did not tell her anything. Some\r\nnew cloud had doubtless appeared on the firmament where there was little\r\nneed for any further clouds. The widow rose on the Monday morning with a\r\npresentiment of calamity on her mind--rose from the bed in Susan\'s room\r\nwhich she occupied for two or three hours in the night, sometimes\r\nsnatching a momentary sleep, which Susan\'s smallest movement\r\ninterrupted. Her heart was rent in two between her children. She went\r\nfrom Susan\'s bedside, where her daughter lay in dumb apathy, not to be\r\nroused by anything that could be said or done, to minister wistfully at\r\nArthur\'s breakfast, which, with her heart in her throat, the widow made\r\na pitiful pretence of sharing. She could not ask him questions. She was\r\nsilent, too, in her great love and sorrow. Seeing some new trouble\r\napproaching--wistfully gazing into the blank skies before her, to\r\ndiscover, if that were possible, without annoying Arthur, or\r\ncompromising him, what it was; but rather than compromise or annoy him,\r\ncontenting herself not to know--the greatest stretch of endurance to\r\nwhich as yet she had constrained her spirit.\r\n\r\nArthur did not go out all that Monday. Even in the house a certain\r\nexcitement was visible to Mrs. Vincent\'s keen observation. The landlady\r\nherself made her appearance in tears to clear away the remains of the\r\nminister\'s dinner. "I hope, sir, as you don\'t think what\'s past and gone\r\nhas made no difference on me," said that tearful woman in Mrs. Vincent\'s\r\nhearing; "it ain\'t me as would ever give my support to such doings."\r\nWhen the widow asked, "What doings?" Arthur only smiled and made some\r\nhalf articulate remark about gossip, which his mother of course treated\r\nat its true value. As the dark wintry afternoon closed in, Mrs.\r\nVincent\'s anxiety increased under the influence of the landlady\'s Sunday\r\ndress, in which she was visible progressing about the passages, and\r\nwarning her husband to mind he wasn\'t late. At last Mrs. Tufton called,\r\nand the minister\'s mother came to a true understanding of the state of\r\naffairs. Mrs. Tufton was unsettled and nervous, filled with a not\r\nunexhilarating excitement, and all the heat of partisanship. "Don\'t you\r\ntake on," said the good little woman; "Mr. Tufton is going to the\r\nmeeting to tell them his sentiments about his young brother. My dear,\r\nthey will never go against what Mr. Tufton says: and if I should mount\r\nupon the platform and make a speech myself, there shan\'t be anything\r\ndone that could vex you; for we always said he was a precious young man,\r\nand a credit to the connection; and it would be a disgrace to us all to\r\nlet the Pigeons, or such people, have it all their own way." Mrs.\r\nVincent managed to ascertain all the particulars from the old minister\'s\r\nwife. When she was gone, the widow sat down a little with a very\r\ndesolate heart to think it all over. Arthur, with a new light in his\r\neye, and determination in his face, was writing in the sitting-room; but\r\nArthur\'s mother could not sit still as he did, and imagine the scene in\r\nthe Salem schoolroom, and how everybody discussed and sat upon her boy,\r\nand decided all the momentous future of his young life in this private\r\ninquisition. She went back, however, beside him, and poured out a cup of\r\ntea for him, and managed to swallow one for herself, talking about Susan\r\nand indifferent household matters, while the evening wore on and the\r\nhour of the meeting approached. A little before that hour Mrs. Vincent\r\nleft Arthur, with an injunction not to come into the sick-room that\r\nevening until she sent for him, as she thought Susan would sleep. As she\r\nleft the room the landlady went downstairs, gorgeous in her best bonnet\r\nand shawl, with all the personal satisfaction which a member of a flock\r\nnaturally feels when called to a bed of justice to decide the future\r\ndestiny of its head. The minister\'s fate was in the hands of his people;\r\nand it was with a pleasurable sensation that, from every house\r\nthroughout Grove Street and the adjacent regions, the good people were\r\ngoing forth to decide it. As for the minister\'s mother, she went softly\r\nback to Susan\'s room, where the nurse, who was Mrs. Vincent\'s assistant,\r\nhad taken her place. "She looks just the same," said the poor mother.\r\n"Just the same," echoed the attendant. "I don\'t think myself as there\'ll\r\nbe no change until----" Mrs. Vincent turned away silently in her\r\nanguish, which she dared not indulge. She wrapped herself in a black\r\nshawl, and took out the thick veil of crape which she had worn in her\r\nfirst mourning. Nobody could recognise her under that screen. But it was\r\nwith a pang that she tied that sign of woe over her pale face. The touch\r\nof the crape made her shiver. Perhaps she was but forestalling the\r\nmourning which, in her age and weakness, she might have to renew again.\r\nWith such thoughts she went softly through the wintry lighted streets\r\ntowards Salem. As she approached the door, groups of people going the\r\nsame way brushed past her through Grove Street. Lively people, talking\r\nwith animation, pleased with this new excitement, declaring, sometimes\r\nso loudly that she could hear them as they passed, what side they were\r\non, and that they, for their part, were going to vote for the minister\r\nto give him another trial. The little figure in those black robes, with\r\nanxious looks shrouded under the crape veil, went on among the rest to\r\nthe Salem schoolroom. She took her seat close to the door, and saw Tozer\r\nand Pigeon, and the rest of the deacons, getting upon the platform,\r\nwhere on occasions more festive the chairman and the leading people had\r\ntea. The widow looked through her veil at the butterman and the\r\npoulterer with one keen pang of resentment, of which she repented\r\ninstantly. She did not despise them as another might have done. They\r\nwere the constituted authorities of the place, and her son\'s fate, his\r\nreputation, his young life, all that he had or could hope for in the\r\nworld, was in their hands. The decision of the highest authorities in\r\nthe land was not so important to Arthur as that of the poulterer and the\r\nbutterman. There they stood, ready to open their session, their\r\ninquisition, their solemn tribunal. The widow drew her veil close, and\r\nclasped her hands together to sustain herself. It was Pigeon who was\r\nabout to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PIGEON was a heavy orator; he was a tall man, badly put together,\r\nwith a hollow crease across his waistcoat, which looked very much as if\r\nhe might be folded in two, and so laid away out of mischief. His arms\r\nmoved foolishly about in the agonies of oratory, as if they did not\r\nbelong to him; but he did not look absurd through Mrs. Vincent\'s crape\r\nveil, as she sat gazing at the platform on which he stood, and taking in\r\nwith eager ears every syllable that came from his lips. Mr. Pigeon said\r\nit was Mr. Vincent as they had come there to discuss that night. The\r\nmanagers had made up their minds as it was a dooty to lay things before\r\nthe flock. Mr. Vincent was but a young man, and most in that\r\ncongregation was ready to make allowances; and as for misfortunes as\r\nmight have happened to him, he wasn\'t a-going to lay that to the\r\npastor\'s charge, nor take no mean advantages. He was for judging a man\r\non his merits, he was. If they was to take Mr. Vincent on his merits\r\nwithout no prejudice, they would find as he hadn\'t carried out the\r\nexpectations as was formed of him. Not as there was anything to be said\r\nagainst his preaching; his preaching was well enough, though it wasn\'t\r\nto call rousing up, which was what most folks wanted. There wasn\'t no\r\ndesire on the part of the managers to object to his preaching: he had\r\nought to have preached well, that was the truth, for every one as had\r\nbeen connected with Salem in Mr. Tufton\'s time knew as there was a deal\r\nof difference between the new pastor and the old pastor, as far as the\r\nwork of a congregation went. As for Pigeon\'s own feelings, he would have\r\nheld his peace cheerful, if his dooty had permitted him, or if he had\r\nseen as it was for the good of the connection. But things was come to\r\nthat pass in Salem as a man hadn\'t ought to mind his own feelings, but\r\nhad to do his dooty, if he was to be took to the stake for it. And them\r\nwere his circumstances, as many a one as he had spoken to in private\r\ncould say, if they was to speak up.\r\n\r\nTo all this Mrs. Vincent listened with the profoundest attention behind\r\nher veil. The schoolroom was very full of people--almost as full as on\r\nthe last memorable tea-party, but the square lines of the gas-burners,\r\ncoming down with two flaring lights each from the low roof, were veiled\r\nwith no festoons this time, and threw an unmitigated glare upon the\r\npeople, all in their dark winter-dresses, without any attempt at special\r\nembellishment. Mrs. Pigeon was in the foreground, on a side-bench near\r\nthe platform, very visible to the minister\'s mother, nodding her head\r\nand giving triumphant glances around now and then to point her husband\'s\r\nconfused sentences. Mrs. Pigeon had her daughters spread out on one side\r\nof her, all in their best bonnets, and at the corner of the same seat\r\nsat little Mrs. Tufton, who shook her charitable head when the\r\npoulterer\'s wife nodded hers, and put her handkerchief to her eyes now\r\nand then, as she gazed up at the platform, not without a certain womanly\r\nmisgiving as to how her husband was going to conduct himself. The Tozers\r\nhad taken up their position opposite. Mrs. Tozer and her daughter had\r\nall the appearance of being in great spirits, especially Phoebe, who\r\nseemed scarcely able to contain her amusement as Mr. Pigeon went on. All\r\nthis Mrs. Vincent saw as clearly as in a picture through the dark folds\r\nof her veil. She sat back as far as she could into the shade, and\r\npressed her hands close together, and was noways amused, but listened\r\nwith as profound an ache of anxiety in her heart as if Pigeon had been\r\nthe Lord Chancellor. As for the audience in general, it showed some\r\nsigns of weariness as the poulterer stumbled on through his confused\r\nspeech; and not a restless gesture, not a suppressed yawn in the place,\r\nbut was apparent to the minister\'s mother. The heart in her troubled\r\nbosom beat steadier as she gazed; certainly no violent sentiment\r\nactuated the good people of Salem as they sat staring with calm eyes at\r\nthe speaker. Mrs. Vincent knew how a congregation looked when it was\r\nthoroughly excited and up in arms against its head. She drew a long\r\nbreath of relief, and suffered the tight clasp of her hands to relax a\r\nlittle. There was surely no popular passion there.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Tufton got up, swaying heavily with his large uncertain old\r\nfigure over the table. The old minister sawed the air with his white fat\r\nhand after he had said "My beloved brethren" twice over; and little\r\nMrs. Tufton, sitting below in her impatience and anxiety lest he should\r\nnot acquit himself well, dropt her handkerchief and disappeared after\r\nit, while Mrs. Vincent erected herself under the shadow of her veil. Mr.\r\nTufton did his young brother no good. He was so sympathetic over the\r\nmisfortunes that had befallen Vincent\'s family, that bitter tears came\r\nto the widow\'s eyes, and her hands once more tightened in a silent\r\nstrain of self-support. While the old minister impressed upon his\r\naudience the duty of bearing with his dear young brother, and being\r\nindulgent to the faults of his youth, it was all the poor mother could\r\ndo to keep silent, to stifle down the indignant sob in her heart, and\r\nkeep steady in her seat. Perhaps it was some breath of anguish escaping\r\nfrom her unawares that drew towards her the restless gleaming eyes of\r\nanother strange spectator there. That restless ghost of a woman!--all\r\nshrunken, gleaming, ghastly--her eyes looking all about in an obliquity\r\nof furtive glances, fearing yet daring everything. When she found Mrs.\r\nVincent out, she fixed her suspicious desperate gaze upon the crape veil\r\nwhich hid the widow\'s face. The deacons of Salem were to Mrs. Hilyard\r\nbut so many wretched masquers playing a rude game among the dreadful\r\nwastes of life, of which these poor fools were ignorant. Sometimes she\r\nwatched them with a reflection of her old amusement--oftener, pursued by\r\nher own tyrannical fancy and the wild restlessness which had brought her\r\nhere, forgot altogether where she was. But Mrs. Vincent\'s sigh, which\r\nbreathed unutterable things--the steady fixed composure of that little\r\nfigure while the old minister maundered on with his condolences, his\r\nregrets, his self-glorification over the interest he had taken in his\r\ndear young brother, and the advice he had given him--could not miss the\r\nuniversal scrutiny of this strange woman\'s eyes. She divined, with a\r\nsudden awakening of the keen intelligence which was half crazed by this\r\ntime, yet vivid as ever, the state of mind in which the widow was. With\r\na half-audible cry the Back Grove Street needlewoman gazed at the\r\nminister\'s mother; in poignant trouble, anxiety, indignant\r\ndistress--clasping her tender hands together yet again to control the\r\nimpatience, the resentment, the aching mortification and injury with\r\nwhich she heard all this maudlin pity overflowing the name of her\r\nboy--yet, ah! what a world apart from the guilty and desperate spirit\r\nwhich sat there gazing like Dives at Lazarus. Mrs. Hilyard slid out of\r\nher seat with a rapid stealthy movement, and placed herself unseen by\r\nthe widow\'s side. The miserable woman put forth her furtive hand and\r\ntook hold of the black gown--the old black silk gown, so well worn and\r\nlong preserved. Mrs. Vincent started a little, looked at her, gave her a\r\nslight half-spasmodic nod of recognition, and returned to her own\r\nabsorbing interest. The interruption made her raise her head a little\r\nhigher under the veil, that not even this stranger might imagine\r\nArthur\'s mother to be affected by what was going on. For everything\r\nelse, Mrs. Hilyard had disappeared out of the widow\'s memory. She was\r\nthinking only of her son.\r\n\r\nAs for the other minister\'s wife, poor Mrs. Tufton\'s handkerchief\r\ndropped a great many times during her husband\'s speech. Oh, if these\r\nblundering men, who mismanage matters so, could but be made to hold\r\ntheir peace! Tears of vexation and distress came into the eyes of the\r\ngood little woman. Mr. Tufton meant to do exactly what was right; she\r\nknew he did; but to sit still and hear him making such a muddle of it\r\nall! Such penalties have to be borne by dutiful wives. She had to smile\r\nfeebly, when he concluded, to somebody who turned round to congratulate\r\nher upon the minister\'s beautiful speech. The beautiful speech had done\r\npoor Vincent a great deal more harm than Pigeon\'s oration. Salem folks,\r\nbeing appealed to on this side, found out that they had, after all, made\r\ngreat allowances for their minister, and that he had not on his part\r\nshown a due sense of their indulgence. Somebody else immediately after\r\nwent on in the same strain: a little commotion began to rise in the\r\nquiet meeting. "Mr. Tufton\'s \'it it," said a malcontent near Mrs.\r\nVincent; "we\'ve been a deal too generous, that\'s what we\'ve been; and\r\nhe\'s turned on us." "He was always too high for my fancy," said another.\r\n"It ain\'t the thing for a pastor to be high-minded; and them lectures\r\nand things was never nothing but vanity; and so I always said." Mrs.\r\nVincent smiled a wan smile to herself under her veil. She refused to let\r\nthe long breath escape from her breast in the form of a sigh. She sat\r\nfast, upright, holding her hands clasped. Things were going against\r\nArthur. Unseen among all his foes, with an answer, and more than an\r\nanswer, to everything they said, burning in dumb restrained eloquence\r\nin her breast, his mother held up his banner. One at least was there who\r\nknew Arthur, and lifted up a dumb protest on his behalf to earth and\r\nheaven. She felt with an uneasy half-consciousness that some haunting\r\nshadow was by her side, and was even vaguely aware of the hold upon her\r\ndress, but had no leisure in her mind for anything but the progress of\r\nthis contest, and the gradual overthrow, accomplishing before her eyes,\r\nof Arthur\'s cause.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Tozer rose up to make that famous speech\r\nwhich has immortalised him in the connection, and for which the Homerton\r\nstudents, in their enthusiasm, voted a piece of plate to the worthy\r\nbutterman. The face of the Salem firmament was cloudy when Tozer rose;\r\nsuggestions of discontent were surging among the audience. Heads of\r\nfamilies were stretching over the benches to confide to each other how\r\nlong it was since they had seen the minister; how he never had visited\r\nas he ought; and how desirable "a change" might prove. Spiteful glances\r\nof triumph sought poor Phoebe and her mother upon their bench, where\r\nthe two began to fail in their courage, and laughed no longer. A crisis\r\nwas approaching. Mrs. Tufton picked up her handkerchief, and sat erect,\r\nwith a frightened face; she, too, knew the symptoms of the coming storm.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances under which Tozer rose in the pastor\'s\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n"Ladies and gentlemen," said Tozer,--"and Mr. Chairman, as I ought to\r\nhave said first, if this meeting had been constituted like most other\r\nmeetings have been in Salem; but, my friends, we haven\'t met not in\r\nwhat I would call an honest and straight-forward way, and consequently\r\nwe ain\'t in order, not as a free assembly should be, as has met to know\r\nits own mind, and not to be dictated to by nobody. There are them as are\r\nready to dictate in every body of men. I don\'t name no names; I don\'t\r\nmake no suggestions; what I\'m a-stating of is a general truth as is well\r\nknown to every one as has studied philosophy. I don\'t come here\r\npretending as I\'m a learned man, nor one as knows better nor my\r\nneighbours. I\'m a plain man, as likes everything fair and aboveboard,\r\nand is content when I\'m well off. What I\'ve got to say to you, ladies\r\nand gentlemen, ain\'t no grumbling nor reflecting upon them as is absent\r\nand can\'t defend themselves. I\'ve got two things to say--first, as I\r\nthink you haven\'t been called together not in an open way; and, second,\r\nthat I think us Salem folks, as ought to know better, is a-quarrelling\r\nwith our bread-and-butter, and don\'t know when we\'re well off!\r\n\r\n"Yes, ladies and gentlemen! them\'s my sentiments! we don\'t know when\r\nwe\'re well off! and if we don\'t mind, we\'ll find out how matters really\r\nis when we\'ve been and disgusted the pastor, and drove him to throw it\r\nall up. Such a thing ain\'t uncommon; many and many\'s the one in our\r\nconnection as has come out for the ministry, meaning nothing but to\r\nstick to it, and has been drove by them as is to be found in every\r\nflock--them as is always ready to dictate--to throw it all up. My\r\nfriends, the pastor as is the subject of this meeting"--here Tozer sank\r\nhis voice and looked round with a certain solemnity--"Mr. Vincent,\r\nladies and gentlemen, as has doubled the seat-holders in Salem in six\r\nmonths\' work, and, I make bold to say, brought one-half of you as is\r\nhere to be regular at chapel, and take an interest in the\r\nconnection-- Mr. Vincent, I say, as you\'re all collected here to knock\r\ndown in the dark, if so be as you are willing to be dictated to--the\r\nsame, ladies and gentlemen, as we\'re a-discussing of to-night--told us\r\nall, it ain\'t so very long ago, in the crowdedest meeting as I ever see,\r\nin the biggest public hall in Carlingford--as we weren\'t keeping up to\r\nthe standard of the old Nonconformists, nor showing, as we ought, what a\r\nvoluntary church could do. It ain\'t pleasant to hear of, for us as\r\nthinks a deal of ourselves; but that is what the pastor said, and there\r\nwas not a man as could contradict it. Now, I ask you, ladies and\r\ngentlemen, what is the reason? It\'s all along of this as we\'re doing\r\nto-night. We\'ve got a precious young man, as Mr. Tufton tells you, and a\r\nclever young man, as nobody tries for to deny; and there ain\'t a single\r\nblessed reason on this earth why he shouldn\'t go on as he\'s been\r\na-doing, till, Salem bein\' crowded out to the doors (as it\'s been two\r\nSundays back), we\'d have had to build a new chapel, and took a place in\r\nour connection as we\'ve never yet took in Carlingford!"\r\n\r\nMr. Tozer paused to wipe his heated forehead, and ease his excited bosom\r\nwith a long breath; his audience paused with him, taking breath with the\r\norator in a slight universal rustle, which is the most genuine\r\napplause. The worthy butterman resumed in a lowered and emphatic tone.\r\n\r\n"But it ain\'t to be," said Tozer, looking round him with a tragic frown,\r\nand shaking his head slowly. "Them as is always a-finding fault, and\r\nalways a-setting up to dictate, has set their faces again\' all that.\r\nIt\'s the way of some folks in our connection, ladies and gentlemen; a\r\nminister ain\'t to be allowed to go on building up a chapel, and making\r\nhisself useful in the world. He ain\'t to be left alone to do his dooty\r\nas his best friends approve. He\'s to be took down out of his pulpit, and\r\ntook to pieces behind his back, and made a talk and a scandal of to the\r\nwhole connection! It\'s not his preaching as he\'s judged by, nor his\r\ndooty to the sick and dyin\', nor any of them things as he was called to\r\nbe pastor for; but it\'s if he\'s seen going to one house more nor\r\nanother, or if he calls often enough on this one or t\'other, and goes to\r\nall the tea-drinkings. My opinion is," said Tozer, suddenly breaking off\r\ninto jocularity, "as a young man as may-be isn\'t a marrying man, and\r\nanyhow can\'t marry more nor one, ain\'t in the safest place at Salem\r\ntea-drinkings; but that\'s neither here nor there. If the ladies haven\'t\r\nno pity, us men can\'t do nothing in that matter; but what I say is\r\nthis," continued the butterman, once more becoming solemn; "to go for to\r\njudge the pastor of a flock, not by the dooty he does to his flock, but\r\nby the times he calls at one house or another, and the way he makes\r\nhisself agreeable at one place or another, ain\'t a thing to be done by\r\nthem as prides themselves on being Christians and Dissenters. It\'s not\r\nlike Christians--and if it\'s like Dissenters the more\'s the pity. It\'s\r\nmean, that\'s what it is," cried Tozer, with fine scorn; "it\'s like a\r\nparcel of old women, if the ladies won\'t mind me saying so. It\'s beneath\r\nus as has liberty of conscience to fight for, and has to set an example\r\nbefore the Church folks as don\'t know no better. But it\'s what is done\r\nin our connection," added the good deacon with pathos, shaking his\r\nforefinger mournfully at the crowd. "When there\'s a young man as is\r\nclever and talented, and fills a chapel, and gives the connection a\r\nchance of standing up in the world as it ought, here\'s some one as jumps\r\nup and says, \'The pastor don\'t come to see me,\' says he--\'the pastor\r\ndon\'t do his duty--he ain\'t the man for Salem.\' And them as is always in\r\nevery flock ready to do a mischief, takes it up; and there\'s talk of a\r\nchange, and meetings is called, and--here we are! Yes, ladies and\r\ngentlemen, here we are! We\'ve called a meeting, all in the dark, and\r\ngive him no chance of defending himself; and them as is at the head of\r\nthis movement is calling upon us to dismiss Mr. Vincent. But let me tell\r\nyou," continued Tozer, lowering his voice with a dramatic intuition, and\r\nshaking his forefinger still more emphatically in the face of the\r\nstartled audience, "that this ain\'t no question of dismissing Mr.\r\nVincent; it\'s a matter of disgusting Mr. Vincent, that\'s what it\r\nis--it\'s a matter of turning another promising young man away from the\r\nconnection, and driving him to throw it all up. You mark what I say.\r\nIt\'s what we\'re doing most places, us Dissenters; them as is talented\r\nand promising and can get a better living working for the world than\r\nworking for the chapel, and won\'t give in to be worried about calling\r\nhere and calling there--we\'re a-driving of them out of the connection,\r\nthat\'s what we\'re doing! I could reckon up as many as six or seven as\r\nhas been drove off already, and I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, what\'s\r\nthe good of subscribing and keeping up of colleges and so forth, if\r\nthat\'s how you\'re a-going to serve every clever young man as trusts\r\nhisself to be your pastor? I\'m a man as don\'t feel no shame to say that\r\nthe minister, being took up with his family affairs and his studies, has\r\nbeen for weeks as he hasn\'t crossed my door; but am I that poor-spirited\r\nas I would drive away a young man as is one of the best preachers in the\r\nconnection, because he don\'t come, not every day, to see me? No, my\r\nfriends! them as would ever suspect such a thing of me don\'t know who\r\nthey\'re a-dealing with; and I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, as this is\r\na question as must come home to every one of your bosoms. Them as is so\r\nset upon their own way that they can\'t hear reason--or them as is led\r\naway by folks as like to dictate--may give their voice again\' the\r\nminister, if so be as they think fit; but as for me, and them as stands\r\nby me, I ain\'t a-going to give in to no such tyranny! It shall never be\r\nsaid in our connection as a clever young man was drove away from\r\nCarlingford, and I had part in it. There\'s the credit o\' the\r\ndenomination to keep up among the Church folks--and there\'s the chapel\r\nto fill, as never had half the sittings let before--and there\'s Mr.\r\nVincent, as is the cleverest young man I ever see in our pulpit, to be\r\nkep\' in the connection; and there ain\'t no man living as shall dictate\r\nto me or them as stands by me! Them as is content to lose the best\r\npreaching within a hundred miles, because the minister don\'t call on two\r\nor three families in Salem, not as often as they would like to see him,"\r\nsaid Tozer, with trenchant sarcasm, "can put down their names again\' Mr.\r\nVincent; but for me, and them as stands by me, we ain\'t a-going to give\r\nin to no such dictation: we ain\'t a-going to set up ourselves against\r\nthe spread of the Gospel, and the credit o\' the connection, and\r\ntoleration and freedom of conscience, as we\'re bound to fight for! If\r\nthe pastor don\'t make hisself agreeable, I can put up with that-- I can;\r\nbut I ain\'t a-going to see a clever young man drove away from Salem, and\r\nthe sittings vacant, and the chapel falling to ruin, and the Church\r\nfolks a-laughing and a-jeering at us, not for all the deacons in the\r\nconnection, nor any man in Carlingford. And this I say for myself and\r\nfor all as stands by me!"\r\n\r\nThe last sentence was lost in thunders of applause. The "Salem folks"\r\nstamped with their feet, knocked the floor with their umbrellas, clapped\r\ntheir hands in a furore of enthusiasm and sympathy. Their pride was\r\nappealed to; nobody could bear the imputation of being numbered among\r\nthe two or three to whom the minister had not paid sufficient attention.\r\nAll the adherents of the Pigeon party deserted that luck-less family\r\nsitting prominent upon their bench, with old Mrs. Tufton at the corner\r\njoining as heartily as her over-shoes would permit in the general\r\ncommotion. There they sat, a pale line of faces, separated, by their\r\nlooks of dismay and irresponsive silence, from the applauding crowd,\r\ncruelly identified as "them as is always ready to dictate." The occasion\r\nwas indeed a grand one, had the leader of the opposition been equal to\r\nit; but Mrs. Pigeon only sat and stared at the new turn of affairs with\r\na hysterical smile of spite and disappointment fixed on her face. Before\r\nthe cheers died away, a young man--one of the Young Men\'s Christian\r\nAssociation connected with Salem--jumped up on a bench in the midst of\r\nthe assembly, and clinched the speech of Tozer. He told the admiring\r\nmeeting that he had been brought up in the connection, but had strayed\r\naway into carelessness and neglect--and when he went anywhere at all on\r\nSundays, went to church like one of the common multitude, till Mr.\r\nVincent\'s lectures on Church and State opened his eyes, and brought him\r\nto better knowledge. Then came another, and another. Mrs. Vincent,\r\nsitting on the back seat with her veil over her face, did not hear what\r\nthey said. The heroic little soul had broken down, and was lost in\r\nsilent tears, and utterances in her heart of thanksgiving, deeper than\r\nwords. No comic aspect of the scene appeared to her; she was not moved\r\nby its vulgarity or oddity. It was deliverance and safety to the\r\nminister\'s mother. Her son\'s honour and his living were alike safe, and\r\nhis people had stood by Arthur. She sat for some time longer, lost in\r\nthat haze of comfort and relief, afraid to move lest perhaps something\r\nuntoward might still occur to change this happy state of affairs--keen\r\nto detect any evil symptom, if such should occur, but unable to follow\r\nwith any exactness the course of those addresses which still continued\r\nto be made in her hearing. She was not quite sure, indeed, whether\r\nanybody had spoken after Tozer, when, with a step much less firm than on\r\nher entrance, she went forth, wiping the tears that blinded her from\r\nunder her veil, into the darkness and quiet of the street outside. But\r\nshe knew that "resolutions" of support and sympathy had been carried by\r\nacclamation, and that somebody was deputed from the flock to assure the\r\nminister of its approval, and to offer him the new lease of popularity\r\nthus won for him in Salem. Mrs. Vincent waited to hear no more. She got\r\nup softly and went forth on noiseless, weary feet, which faltered, now\r\nthat her anxiety was over, with fatigue and agitation. Thankful to the\r\nbottom of her heart, yet at the same time doubly worn out with that\r\ndeliverance, confused with the lights, the noises, and the excitement of\r\nthe scene, and beginning already to take up her other burden, and to\r\nwonder by times, waking up with sharp touches of renewed anguish, how\r\nshe might find Susan, and whether "any change" had appeared in her other\r\nchild. It was thus that the great Salem congregational meeting, so\r\nrenowned in the connection, ended for the minister\'s mother. She left\r\nthem still making speeches when she emerged into Grove Street. The\r\npolitical effect of Tozer\'s address, or the influence which his new\r\ndoctrine might have on the denomination, did not occur to Mrs. Vincent.\r\nShe was thinking only of Arthur. Not even the darker human misery by her\r\nside had power to break through her preoccupation. How the gentle\r\nlittle woman had shaken off that anxious hand which grasped her old\r\nblack dress, she never knew herself, nor could any one tell; somehow she\r\nhad done it: alone, as she entered, she went away again--secret, but not\r\nclandestine, under that veil of her widowhood. She put it up from her\r\nface when she got into the street, and wiped her tears off with a\r\ntrembling, joyful hand. She could not see her way clearly for those\r\ntears of joy. When they were dried, and the crape shadow put back from\r\nher face, Mrs. Vincent looked up Grove Street, where her road lay in the\r\ndarkness, broken by those flickering lamps. It was a windy night, and\r\nDr. Rider\'s drag went up past her rapidly, carrying the doctor home from\r\nsome late visit, and recalling her thoughts to her own patient whom she\r\nhad left so long. She quickened her tremulous steps as Dr. Rider\r\ndisappeared in the darkness; but almost before she had got beyond the\r\nlast echoes of the Salem meeting, that shadow of darker woe and misery\r\nthan any the poor mother wist of, was again by Mrs. Vincent\'s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n"YOU are not able to walk so fast," said Mrs. Hilyard, coming up to the\r\nwidow as she crossed over to the darker side of Grove Street, just where\r\nthe house of the Miss Hemmings turned its lighted staircase-window to\r\nthe street; "and it will not harm you to let me speak to you. Once you\r\noffered me your hand, and would have gone with me. It is a long long\r\ntime ago--ages since--but I remember it. I do not come after you for\r\nnothing. Let me speak. You said you were a--a minister\'s wife, and knew\r\nhuman nature," she continued, with a certain pause of reverence, and at\r\nthe same time a gleam of amusement, varying for a moment the blank and\r\nbreathless voice in which she had spoken. "I want your advice."\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent, who had paused with an uncomfortable sensation of being\r\npursued, recovered herself a little during this address. The minister\'s\r\nmother had no heart to linger and talk to any one at that moment, after\r\nall the excitement of the evening, with her fatigued frame and occupied\r\nmind; but still she was the minister\'s mother, as ready and prepared as\r\nArthur himself ought to have been, to hear anything that any of the\r\nflock might have to say to her, and to give all the benefit of her\r\nexperience to anybody connected with Salem, who might be in trouble. "I\r\nbeg your pardon," said Mrs. Vincent; "my daughter is ill--that is why I\r\nwas making so much haste; but I am sure, if I can be of any use to any\r\nmember of-- I mean to any of my son\'s friends"--she concluded rather\r\nabruptly. She did not remember much about this woman, who was strangely\r\nunlike the other people in Salem. When was that time in which they had\r\nmet before? The widow\'s mind had been so swept by the whirlwind of\r\nevents and emotions, that she remembered only dimly how and where it was\r\nshe had formerly seen her strange companion.\r\n\r\n"Your daughter is ill?" said Mrs. Hilyard; "that is how trouble happens\r\nto you. You are a good woman; you don\'t interfere in God\'s business; and\r\nthis is how your trouble comes. You can nurse her and be about her bed;\r\nand when she wakes up, it is to see you and be grateful to you. But my\r\nchild," she said, touching the widow\'s arm suddenly with her hand, and\r\nsuppressing painfully a shrill tone of anguish in her voice which would\r\nbreak through, "does not know me. She opens her blue eyes--they are not\r\neven my eyes--they are Alice\'s eyes, who has no right to my child--and\r\nlooks at me as if I were a stranger; and for all this time, since I\r\nparted with her, I have not heard--I do not know where she is. Hush,\r\nhush, hush!" she went on, speaking to herself, "to think that this is\r\nme, and that I should break down so at last. A woman has not soul enough\r\nto subdue her nerves for ever. But this is not what I wanted to say to\r\nyou. I gave Miss Smith your son\'s address----"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, she paused, and looked anxiously at the widow, who\r\nlooked at her also in the windy gleams of lamplight with more and more\r\nperplexity. "Who is Miss Smith?" asked poor Mrs. Vincent. "Who are--you?\r\nIndeed, I am very sorry to seem rude; but my mind has been so much\r\noccupied. Arthur, of course, would know if he were here, but Susan\'s\r\nillness has taken up all my thoughts; and--I beg your pardon--she may\r\nwant me even now," she continued, quickening her steps. Even the\r\ncourtesy due to one of the flock had a limit; and the minister\'s mother\r\nknew it was necessary not to yield too completely to all the demands\r\nthat her son\'s people might make upon her. Was this even one of her\r\nson\'s people? Such persons were unusual in the connection. Mrs. Vincent,\r\nall fatigued, excited, and anxious as she was, felt at her wits\' end.\r\n\r\n"Yes, your son would know if he were here; he has taken my parole and\r\ntrusted me," said the strange woman; "but a woman\'s parole should not be\r\ntaken. I try to keep it; but unless they come, or I have news---- Who am\r\nI? I am a woman that was once young and had friends. They married me to\r\na man, who was not a man, but a fine organisation capable of pleasures\r\nand cruelties. Don\'t speak. You are very good; you are a minister\'s\r\nwife. You don\'t know what it is, when one is young and happy, to find\r\nout all at once that life means only so much torture and misery, and so\r\nmany lies, either done by you or borne by you--what does it matter\r\nwhich? My baby came into the world with a haze on her sweet soul because\r\nof that discovery. If it had been but her body!" said Mrs. Vincent\'s\r\nstrange companion, with bitterness. "A dwarfed creature, or deformed,\r\nor---- But she was beautiful--she is beautiful, as pretty as Alice; and\r\nif she lives, she will be rich. Hush, hush! you don\'t know what my fears\r\nwere," continued Mrs. Hilyard, with a strange humility, once more\r\nputting her hand on the widow\'s arm. "If he could have got possession of\r\nher, how could I tell what he might have done?--killed her--but that\r\nwould have been dangerous; poisoned what little mind she had left--made\r\nher like her mother. I stole her away. Long ago, when I thought she\r\nmight have been safe with you, I meant to have told you. I stole her out\r\nof his power. For a little while she was with me, and he traced us--then\r\nI sent the child away. I have not seen her but in glimpses, lest he\r\nshould find her. It has cost me all I had, and I have lived and worked\r\nwith my hands," said the needlewoman of Back Grove Street, lifting her\r\nthin fingers to the light and looking at them, pathetic vouchers to the\r\ntruth of her story. "When he drove me desperate," she went on, labouring\r\nin vain to conceal the panting, long-drawn breath which impeded her\r\nutterance, "you know? I don\'t talk of that. The child put her arms round\r\nthat old woman after her mother had saved her. She had not a word, not a\r\nword for me, who had done---- But it was all for her sake. This is what\r\nI have had to suffer. She looked in my face and waved me away from her\r\nand said, \'Susan, Susan!\' Susan meant your daughter--a new friend, a\r\ncreature whom she had not seen a week before--and no word, no look, no\r\nrecognition for me!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am very sorry, very sorry!" said Mrs. Vincent, in her turn taking\r\nthe poor thin hand with an instinct of consolation. Susan\'s name, thus\r\nintroduced, went to the mother\'s heart. She could have wept over the\r\nother mother thus complaining, moaning out her troubles in her\r\ncompassionate ear.\r\n\r\n"I left them in a safe place. I came home to fall into your son\'s hands.\r\nHe might have been sure, had it come to that, that no one should have\r\nsuffered for me" said Mrs. Hilyard, with again a tone of bitterness.\r\n"What was my life worth, could any man suppose? And since then I have\r\nnot heard a word--not a word--whether the child is still where I left\r\nher, or whether some of his people have found her--or whether she is\r\nill--or whether-- I know nothing, nothing! Have a little pity upon me,\r\nyou innocent woman! I never asked pity, never sought sympathy before;\r\nbut a woman can never tell what she may be brought to. I am brought down\r\nto the lowest depths. I cannot stand upright any longer," she cried,\r\nwith a wailing sigh. "I want somebody--somebody at least to give me a\r\nlittle comfort. Comfort! I remember," she said, with one of those sudden\r\nchanges of tone which bewildered Mrs. Vincent, "your son once spoke to\r\nme of getting comfort from those innocent young sermons of his. He knows\r\na little better now; he does not sail over the surface now as he used to\r\ndo in triumph. Life has gone hard with him, as with me and all of us.\r\nTell him, if I get no news I will break my parole. I cannot help\r\nmyself--a woman\'s honour is not her word. I told him so. Say to your\r\nson----"\r\n\r\n"My son? what have you to do with my son?" said Mrs. Vincent, with a\r\nsudden pang. The poor mother was but a woman too. She did not understand\r\nwhat this connection was. A worn creature, not much younger than\r\nherself, what possible tie could bind her to Arthur? The widow, like\r\nother women, could believe in any "infatuation" of men; but could not\r\nunderstand any other bond subsisting between these two. The thought went\r\nto her heart. Young men had been known before now to be mysteriously\r\nattracted by women old, unbeautiful, unlike themselves. Could this be\r\nArthur\'s fate? Perhaps it was a danger more dismal than that which he\r\nhad just escaped in Salem. Mrs. Vincent grew sick at heart. She\r\nrepeated, with an asperity of which her soft voice might have been\r\nthought incapable, "What have you to do with my son?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hilyard made no answer--perhaps she did not hear the question. Her\r\neyes, always restlessly turning from one object to another, had found\r\nout, in the lighted street to which they had now come, a belated postman\r\ndelivering his last letters. She followed him with devouring looks; he\r\nwent to Vincent\'s door as they approached, delivered something, and\r\npassed on into the darkness with a careless whistle. While Mrs. Vincent\r\nwatched her companion with doubtful and suspicious looks through the\r\nveil which, once more among the lights of Grange Street, the minister\'s\r\nmother had drawn over her face, the unconscious object of her suspicion\r\ngrasped her arm, and turned to her with beseeching eyes. "It may be news\r\nof my child?" she said, with a supplication beyond words. She drew the\r\nwidow on with the desperation of her anxiety. The little maid had still\r\nthe letter in her hand when she opened the door. It was not even for Mr.\r\nVincent. It was for the mistress of the house, who had not yet returned\r\nfrom the meeting at Salem. Mrs. Vincent paused upon the threshold,\r\ncompassionate but determined. She looked at the unhappy woman who stood\r\nupon the steps in the light of the lamp, gazing eagerly in at the door,\r\nand resolved that she should penetrate no farther; but even in the\r\nheight of her determination the widow\'s heart smote her when she looked\r\nat that face, so haggard and worn with passion and anxiety, with its\r\nfurtive gleaming eyes, and all the dark lines of endurance which were so\r\napparent now, when the tide of emotion had grown too strong to be\r\nconcealed. "Have you--no--friends in Carlingford?" said the widow, with\r\nhesitation and involuntary pity. She could not ask her to enter where,\r\nperhaps, her presence might be baleful to Arthur; but the little woman\'s\r\ntender heart ached, even in the midst of her severity, for the suffering\r\nin that face.\r\n\r\n"Nowhere!" said Mrs. Hilyard; then, with a gleam out of her eyes which\r\ntook the place of a smile, "Do not be sorry for me; I want no\r\nfriends--nobody could share my burden with me. I am going back--home--to\r\nAlice. Tell Mr. Vincent; I think something must happen to-night," she\r\nadded, with a slight shiver; "it grows intolerable, beyond bearing.\r\nPerhaps by the telegraph--or perhaps---- And Miss Smith has this\r\naddress. I told you my story," she went on, drawing closer, and taking\r\nthe widow\'s hand, "that you might have pity on me, and understand--no,\r\nnot understand; how could she?--but if you were like me, do you think\r\nyou could sit still in one place, with so much upon your heart? You\r\nnever could be like me--but if you had lost your child----"\r\n\r\n"I did," said Mrs. Vincent, drawing a painful breath at the\r\nrecollection, and drawn unwittingly by the sight of the terrible anxiety\r\nbefore her into a reciprocation of confidence--"my child who had been in\r\nmy arms all her life-- God gave her back again; and now, while I am\r\nspeaking, He may be taking her away," said the mother, with a sudden\r\nreturn of all her anxiety. "I cannot do you any good, and Susan may want\r\nme: good-night--good-night."\r\n\r\n"It was not God who gave her back to you," said Mrs. Hilyard, grasping\r\nthe widow\'s hand closer--"it was I--remember it was I. When you think\r\nhardly of me, recollect--I did it. She might have been--but I freed\r\nher--remember; and if you hear anything, if it were but a whisper, of my\r\nchild, think of it, and have pity on me. You will?--you understand what\r\nI say?"\r\n\r\nThe widow drew away her hand with a pang of fear. She retreated\r\nhurriedly, yet with what dignity she could, calling the little maid to\r\nshut the door.\r\n\r\nWhen that strange face, all gleaming, haggard, and anxious, was shut out\r\ninto the night, Mrs. Vincent went up-stairs very hastily, scarcely able\r\nto give her alarmed withdrawal the aspect of an orderly retreat. Was\r\nthis woman mad to whom she had been speaking so calmly? In her agitation\r\nshe forgot all the precautions with which she had intended to soften to\r\nher son the fact of her attendance at that meeting of which he had not\r\neven informed her. Pursued by the recollection of that face, she\r\nhastened to Arthur, still in her bonnet and veil. He was seated at the\r\ntable writing as when she left him; but all the minister\'s self-control\r\ncould not conceal a certain expectancy and excitement in the eyes which\r\nhe raised with a flash of eager curiosity to see who it was that thus\r\ninvaded his solitude. "Mother! where have you been?" he asked, with\r\nirritation, when he perceived her. His impatience and anxiety, and the\r\ngreat effort he had made to subdue both, betrayed him into a momentary\r\noutburst of annoyance and vexation. "Where have you been?" he repeated,\r\nthrowing down his pen. "Surely not to this meeting, to compromise me, as\r\nif I had not trouble enough already!" This rude accost put her immediate\r\nsubject out of Mrs. Vincent\'s mind: she went up to her son with\r\ndeprecating looks, and put her hand fondly on his head. The tears came\r\ninto her eyes, not because his words offended or grieved her, but for\r\njoy of the good news she had to tell; for the minister\'s mother was\r\nexperienced in the ways of man, and knew how many things a woman does\r\nfor love which she gets no thanks for doing. Her boy\'s anger did not\r\nmake her angry, but it drove other matters, less important, out of her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Arthur, no one saw me," she said; "I had my veil down all the time.\r\nHow could I help going when I knew of it? I did not tell you--I did not\r\nmean you to know; but it was impossible to stay away," cried the widow,\r\nperceiving her son\'s impatience while she explained herself, and growing\r\nconfused in consequence, "when I heard what was going on. Oh, Arthur\r\ndear, don\'t look so disturbed; they know better than you imagine--they\r\nappreciate you, though they have not the way of showing it. I have seen\r\nthings happen so differently, that I know the value of such friends as\r\nyou have in the flock. Oh, my dear boy, don\'t look so strange! It has\r\nbeen a great triumph, Arthur. There is a deputation coming to offer you\r\ntheir support and sympathy. All this dreadful business has not harmed\r\nyou. Thank God for that! I think I shall be able to bear anything now."\r\n\r\nThe minister got up hastily from his chair, and took refuge on the\r\nhearthrug. He changed colour; grew red and grew pale; and by way of\r\nescaping from the complication of feelings that moved him, once more\r\nbroke out into impatient exclamations. "Why did you go? Why did not you\r\ntell me you were going?" he said. "Why did you leave Susan, who wanted\r\nyou? Mother, you will never understand that a man\'s affairs must not be\r\nmeddled with!" cried the Nonconformist, with an instinctive effort to\r\nconceal the agitation into which this unexpected news threw him. Then he\r\nbegan to pace about the room, exclaiming against the impatience of\r\nwomen, who can never wait for a result. The young man was too proud to\r\nacknowledge the state of feverish suspense in which he had been, or the\r\nwonderful tumult suddenly produced in his mind. He seized upon this\r\nready safety-valve of irritation, which was half real and half\r\nfictitious. It gave him time to collect his troubled thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Arthur dear, hush! no one saw me at the meeting. I had my veil down,\r\nand spoke to nobody," said the widow: "and oh! don\'t you think it was\r\nonly natural that your mother should be there? No one in the world is so\r\nmuch interested in what concerns you. I spoke to no one--except," said\r\nMrs. Vincent, with a little effort, "that strange woman, Arthur, whom\r\nyou have had so much to do with. Who is she? Oh, my dear boy, I hope you\r\nhave not formed any connections that you will repent? She said something\r\nabout a promise, and having given her word. I don\'t know why you should\r\nhave her word, or what she has to do with you. She came here to the door\r\nwith me to-night."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Hilyard!" cried the minister, suddenly roused. "Mrs.----; no\r\nmatter what her name is. Where is she? Do you mean that she came here?\r\nThey keep no watch over her. To-night of all nights in the world! If you\r\nhad but stayed at home, I should not have known of her wanderings at\r\nleast," he said, with vexation. "Now I shall have to go and look after\r\nher--she must be sent back again--she must not be allowed to escape."\r\n\r\n"Is she mad?" said Mrs. Vincent, alarmed, yet relieved. "Don\'t go away,\r\nArthur; she is not here. She said I was to tell you that she had gone\r\nback--to Alice. Who is Alice?--who is this woman? What have you to do\r\nwith her? Oh! my dear boy, you are a minister, and the world is so ready\r\nto make remarks. She said you had her word. Oh, Arthur, I hope it does\r\nnot mean anything you will live to repent?" cried the anxious mother,\r\nfixing her jealous eyes on her son\'s face. "She is not like you. I\r\ncannot tell what you can have to do with such a woman--you who\r\nmight----" Mrs. Vincent\'s fright and anxiety exhausted both her language\r\nand her breath.\r\n\r\n"It does not matter much after all," said the Nonconformist, who had\r\nbeen busy with his own thoughts, and had only half heard his mother\'s\r\nadjurations. "Like me?--what has that to do with the matter? But I\r\ndaresay she will go back, as she said; and now that he is out of danger,\r\nand has not accused her, things must take their chance. Mad? It would\r\nnot be wonderful if she were mad. I can sympathise with people when they\r\nare driven out of their wits. Who is this next? Another messenger from\r\nthe meeting, or perhaps your deputation? I think I shall go mad after a\r\nwhile if I get no rest."\r\n\r\nBut as the minister stood in ill-concealed excitement by the fire, not\r\nwithout expectation that it might be somebody with an official report\r\nfrom Salem, Mr. Vincent\'s landlady, still in her bonnet and shawl, just\r\nreturned from the meeting, came in to tell the widow of the approach of\r\nthe doctor. "He\'s a-coming directly, ma\'am; he\'s gone in for a minute\r\nto Smith\'s, next door, where they\'ve got the hooping-cough. And oh, Mr.\r\nVincent, sir," cried the woman, who had made this a pretence to express\r\nher sentiments on the more important subject, "if there hasn\'t a-been a\r\nsweet meeting! I\'d have giv\' a half-year\'s rent, ma\'am, the pastor had\r\nbeen there. All as unanimous and as friendly!--all but them Pigeons, as\r\nare the poison of the place; and sweet Miss Phoebe Tozer a-crying of\r\nher pretty eyes out; but there ain\'t no occasion for crying now," said\r\nthe triumphant landlady, who had a real stake in the matter. At this\r\ntouch the minister regained his composure. He went back to his seat at\r\nthe table, and took up the pen he had thrown down. A bishop could not\r\nhave looked more grandly indifferent than did the Nonconformist as he\r\nturned his back upon his anxious partisan. "Tell the doctor to let me\r\nknow how Susan is, mother, for I am busy to-night," said the young man.\r\n"I cannot leave my work just now even for Dr. Rider." He began again to\r\nwrite in the excitement of his mind, and produced a sentence which was\r\nnot one of the least successful of his sentences, while the two women\r\nwith a certain awe stood silent behind his chair.\r\n\r\n"I will not disturb you any longer, my dear boy. Good-night," said Mrs.\r\nVincent. She went away, followed by the discomfited landlady, who was\r\noverwhelmed, and did not know what to make of it. The widow could not\r\nbut improve such an opportunity. "The minister must not be disturbed in\r\nhis studies," she said, with importance and in a whisper as she closed\r\nthe door. "When he is engaged with a subject, it does not answer to go\r\nin upon him and disturb his attention. Neither meetings nor anything\r\nelse, however important, should interrupt a pastor when he is engaged in\r\ncomposition," said the little woman, grandly. But while the mistress of\r\nthe house departed to her own quarter much overawed, the minister\'s\r\nmother went to the sick-room with no such composure as she assumed.\r\nSomething she did not understand was in Arthur\'s mind. The Salem meeting\r\ndid not appear to her so conclusive as it had done an hour ago. He was\r\nyoung and high-spirited and proud, and had not that dutiful subjection\r\nto the opinions of the flock which became a minister of Salem. What if\r\nthat visionary horror with which she had frightened Tozer might turn out\r\na real danger? Though she had made such skilful use of it, the\r\npossibility she had herself invented had not really alarmed her; but the\r\nthought thrilled through her now with a fear which had some remorse in\r\nit. She had invoked the ghost, not much believing in any such\r\nsupernatural climax; but if the apparition really made itself visible,\r\nthe widow recognised at once her entire want of any power to lay it. She\r\ntook off her shawl and bonnet with little comfort in her mind on that\r\nsubject to support her under the returning pangs of anxiety about Susan,\r\nwhich overwhelmed her again as she opened the door of the sick-room. The\r\ntwo troubles united in her heart and aggravated each other, as with a\r\nsick throb of expectation she went in to Susan\'s bedside. Perhaps there\r\nmight be "a change"--for better or for worse, something might have\r\nhappened. The doctor might find something more conclusive to-night in\r\nthat languid pallid face. The noiseless room struck her with a chill of\r\nmisery as she went to her usual place, carrying the active life of pain\r\nand a troubled heart into that melancholy atmosphere from which life\r\nseemed to have fled. With a faltering voice she spoke to Susan, who\r\nshowed no signs of hearing her except by a feeble half-lifting of her\r\nheavy eyelids and restless motion of her frame. No change! Never any\r\nchange! or, at least, as the nurse imagined, until---- The widow\'s heart\r\nheaved with a silent sob of anguish--anguish sharp and acute as it is\r\nwhen our misery breaks suddenly upon us out of a veil of other thoughts,\r\nand we feel it intolerable. This sudden pang convulsed Mrs. Vincent\'s\r\nmuch-tried heart as she wiped the bitter tears out of her eyes and\r\nlooked at her child, thus gliding, in a hopeless apathy and\r\nunconsciousness, out of the arms that strained themselves in vain to\r\nhold her. After so much as she had borne in her troubled life, God knows\r\nit was hard. She did not rebel, but her heart lifted up a bitter cry to\r\nthe Father in heaven.\r\n\r\nIt was just then, while her anxious ear caught the step of the doctor on\r\nthe stair, that Mrs. Vincent was aware also of a carriage driving\r\nrapidly up to the door. Preoccupied as she was, the sound startled her.\r\nA passing wonder who it could be, and the vague expectation which\r\ninfluences the mind at the great crises of life, when one feels that\r\nanything may happen, moved her dimly as she rose to receive the doctor.\r\nDr. Rider came in with his noiseless step and anxious face; they shook\r\nhands with each other mechanically, she gazing at him to see what his\r\nopinion was before it could be formed--he looking with solicitous\r\nserious eyes on the sick-bed. The light was dim, and Dr. Rider held it\r\nup to see his patient. There she lay, moving now and then with the\r\nrestlessness of weakness, the pale large eyelids half closed, the pale\r\nlips dropping apart,--a solemn speechless creature, abstracted already\r\nout of this world and all its influences. The light that streamed over\r\nher for the moment made no difference to Susan. There was nothing here\r\npowerful enough to rouse the soul which horror and passion had driven\r\ninto one terrible corner of memory, obliterating all the rest of her\r\nlife. Dr. Rider looked at her with eyes in which the impatience of\r\npowerless strength overcame even his professional reserve. He wrung the\r\nwidow\'s hand, which she laid on his arm in a trembling appeal to him to\r\ntell her the worst. "The worst is that she is dying before our eyes, and\r\nthat she might be saved," he said, leading the poor mother to the other\r\nend of the room. "All her heart and soul are concentrated upon that time\r\nwhen she was away from you; unless we can rouse her by something that\r\nwill recall that time, she will never know you more. Think! is there\r\nnothing that would wake her up even to remember the misery she endured?\r\nWhere is your servant who was with her?--but she has seen her lately,\r\nand nothing has come of that. If you have the courage and strength,"\r\nsaid the doctor, once more grasping Mrs. Vincent\'s hand tight, "to talk\r\nof that man under the name she knew him by--to talk of him so as perhaps\r\nshe might hear; to discuss the matter; anything that will recall her\r\nmind. Hush! what is that noise down-stairs?"\r\n\r\nEven while listening to the doctor\'s dreadful suggestion, Mrs. Vincent\r\nhad been aware of the opening of the door down-stairs, and of a sound of\r\nvoices. She was trembling so that she could scarcely stand, principally,\r\nno doubt, on account of this strange demand which he made upon her\r\nstrength, but with a nervous expectation besides which she could not\r\nexplain even to herself. But when, out of that confused commotion below,\r\nthere rose faint but audible the sound of a voice calling "Susan!\r\nSusan!" the two anxious people started apart, and turned a wondering\r\nmomentary gaze upon each other, involuntarily asking what was that? what\r\ndid it mean? Then the doctor rushed to the door, where the widow\r\nfollowed him as well as her trembling limbs would permit. She saw him\r\ndash down-stairs, and herself stood grasping the railing, waiting for\r\nwhat was about to happen, with her heart so beating and fluttering in\r\nher breast that she could scarcely breathe for it. She could make\r\nnothing of the rapid interrogation that went on downstairs. She heard\r\nthe voice of the doctor in hasty questions, and the slow, agitated,\r\nsomewhat confused utterance of a strange voice, which appeared to answer\r\nhim; and once or twice through these sounds came the strange cry,\r\n"Susan! Susan!" which went to the widow\'s heart. Who could this be that\r\ncalled upon Susan with so pathetic a repetition? It seemed a very long\r\ninterval to Mrs. Vincent before the doctor reappeared, and yet so short\r\nwas the time, that the door by which the new-comers, whoever they were,\r\nhad entered, was still open, admitting some strange familiar sounds from\r\nthe street into the bewildering maze of wonder and expectation. Mrs.\r\nVincent held fast by the rails to support herself, when she saw the\r\ndoctor returning up the stair, leading by the hand a girl whom he\r\ngrasped fast, and carried along with him by a kind of gentle but strong\r\ncompulsion. It was she who was calling Susan, gazing round her with\r\nlarge dilated blue eyes, looking everywhere for something she had not\r\nyet found. A beautiful girl--more beautiful than anything mortal to the\r\nwidow\'s surprised and wondering eyes. Who was she? The face was very\r\nyoung, sadly simple, framed by long curling locks of fair hair, and the\r\nbroad circle of a large flapping Leghorn hat and blue veil. A bewildered\r\nhalf-recognition came to Mrs. Vincent\'s mind as this blue veil waved in\r\nher face in the wind from the open door; but excitement and anxiety had\r\ndeprived her of speech: she could ask no questions. "Here is the\r\nphysician," said Dr. Rider, with a kindred excitement in his voice. He\r\nwent into the room before her, leading the girl, behind whom there\r\nfollowed slowly a confused and disturbed woman, whose face Mrs. Vincent\r\nfelt she had seen before. The mother, half jealous in her wonder,\r\npressed in after the doctor to guard her Susan even from experiments of\r\nhealing. "Doctor, doctor, who is it?" she said. But Dr. Rider held up\r\nhis hand imperatively to silence her. The room was imperfectly lighted\r\nwith candles burning dimly, and a faint glow of firelight. "Susan!"\r\ncried the eager child\'s voice, with a weary echo of longing and\r\ndisappointment. "Susan!--take me to Susan; she is not here." Then Dr.\r\nRider led her round to the bedside, closely followed by the widow, and,\r\nlifting a candle, threw its light fully upon the stranger. "Is it\r\nSusan?" said the girl. "Will she not speak to me?--is she dead? Susan,\r\noh Susan, Susan!" It was an outcry of childish impatience and despair,\r\nrising louder than any voice had risen in that room for many a day. Then\r\nshe burst forth into tears and sobs. "Susan!--she will not speak to me,\r\nshe will not look at me!" cried the stranger, drawing her arm out of the\r\ndoctor\'s hold, and clasping her hands together. There was a slight\r\nmovement in the bed; not the restless tossing with which her nurse was\r\nfamiliar, but a trembling shiver came over that dying frame. The sound\r\nhad reached to the dull ears of the patient. She lifted her heavy\r\neyelids, and looked round with half-awakened eyes. "Call her again,\r\nagain!" said the doctor, in an intense whisper, which seemed to thrill\r\nthrough the room. The girl, who was engaged with a much more engrossing\r\ninterest of her own, took no notice of the doctor. She knew nothing\r\nabout Susan\'s danger--she was bent on gaming succour for herself.\r\n"Susan! tell her to look at me--at me! Susan! I care for nobody but\r\nyou!" said the lovely helpless creature, with strange half-articulate\r\ncries, pressing closer to the bed. "You are to take care of me." Mrs.\r\nVincent pressed forward with pangs of anxiety, of terror, of hope, and\r\nof a mother\'s tender jealousy through all, as these strange entreaties\r\nfilled the room. She too cried aloud, as she perceived the awakening in\r\nthat pallid face, the faint movement as if to raise herself up, which\r\nindicated a conscious effort on the part of Susan. The clouds were\r\nbreaking on that obscured and hopeless firmament. The light, which\r\ntrembled in the doctor\'s hand, caught a gleam of understanding and life\r\nin Susan\'s eyes, as her mother flew to raise her up, obeying the\r\nsuggestion of that unhoped-for movement. "Susan! you said you would take\r\ncare of me!" cried the young stranger, throwing herself upon the bedside\r\nand grasping at the weak arm which once had protected her. The touch of\r\nher hands awoke the slumbering soul. Slowly the light grew in Susan\'s\r\neyes. She who had not moved for days except in the restless tossings of\r\nlanguor, lifted those white feeble arms to put them round the appealing\r\nchild. Then Susan struggled up, faint, yet inspired, unconscious of her\r\nmother\'s help that enabled her to do so, and confronted the strange\r\npeople in her room, whom she had seen for weeks past, but did not know,\r\nwith living eyes. "Nobody shall touch her--we will protect each other,"\r\nsaid the voice that had grown strange even to her mother\'s ears. Mrs.\r\nVincent could hardly be restrained from breaking in with a thousand\r\ncaresses and outcries of joy and thankfulness. But Dr. Rider quieted the\r\npoor mother with a touch of his hand. "Let them alone," he said, with\r\nthat authority which no one in a sick-room can resist. Mrs. Vincent kept\r\nback with unspeakable pangs in her heart, and watched the waking up of\r\nthat paralysed life which, alike in its loss and its recovery, had been\r\nswept apart from her into another world. Without any help from her\r\nmother, without even recognising her mother or distinguishing her from\r\nthe strangers round, Susan\'s soul awoke. She raised herself more and\r\nmore among those pillows where a little while ago she lay so\r\npassively--she opened her eyes fully and looked round upon the man by\r\nher bedside, and the other indistinct figures in the room, with a look\r\nof resistance and conscious strength. "We will protect each other," said\r\nSusan, slowly, "nobody shall harm her--we will keep each other safe."\r\nThen, after another interval, other instincts awoke in the reviving\r\nsoul. She cast a wistful look from one to another, always drawing her\r\nfaint white arm round the girl who clung to her and found security in\r\nher clasp. "Hush, hush! there are women here," she said in a whisper,\r\nand with a tone of strange confusion, light breaking through the\r\ndarkness. Then there followed a long pause. Dr. Rider stood by the\r\nbedside holding up his candle, attracting the wandering wistful glances\r\nof his patient, who ceased to look at him with defiance as her eyes\r\nagain and again returned to the face, of which, often as it had bent\r\nover her, she had no knowledge. All over the unknown room wandered those\r\nstrange looks, interrogating everything with a wistfulness beyond words.\r\nWhat was this strange unfamiliar world into which, after her trance of\r\nsuffering, Susan had awakened? She did not know where she was, nor who\r\nthe people were who surrounded her. But the recollection of deadly peril\r\nwas not more distinct upon her confused mind than was the sentiment of\r\nsafety, of love, and watchfulness which somehow abode in this strange\r\ndim room, in the little undecipherable circle of faces which surrounded\r\nher bed. "Hush!" said Susan again, holding the stranger close. "Here are\r\nwomen--women! nobody will harm us;" then, with a sudden flush over all\r\nher face and cry of joy as the doctor suddenly threw the light full upon\r\nMrs. Vincent, who was bending over her, her mind struggled into\r\npossession of itself,--"Here is my mother! she has come to take us\r\nhome!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent remembered nothing more; she did not faint, for her child\r\nwanted her--she sat all the night through on the bed, with Susan leaning\r\nagainst her shoulder, clinging to her, holding her fast--starting again\r\nand again to make sure that all was safe, and that it was, indeed, her\r\nmother\'s arms that held her. Her soul was recalled out of that trance of\r\ndeath. They laid the beautiful child upon the sofa in her young\r\nguardian\'s sight, to keep up that happy influence; and when the night\r\nwas about half spent, the widow, throbbing all over her wearied frame\r\nwith exhaustion, pain, and joy, perceived that her Susan had fallen deep\r\nand sweet asleep, clasping close, as if never again to lose hold of\r\nthem, her mother\'s tender hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE after-events of the evening naturally lessened, in the minister\'s\r\nfamily at least, the all-absorbing interest of the meeting at Salem.\r\nEven Mr. Vincent\'s landlady, in her wondering narrative of the scene in\r\nthe sick-room--which, all Mrs. Vincent\'s usual decorums being thrust\r\naside by that unexpected occurrence, she had witnessed--forgot the other\r\npublic event which was of equally great importance. The house was in a\r\nstate of agitation as great as on Susan\'s return; and when the exulting\r\ndoctor, whose experiment had been so rarely successful, turned all\r\nsupernumerary persons out of the sick-room, it fell to Vincent\'s part to\r\ntake charge of the perplexed governess, Miss Smith, who stood outside,\r\nanxious to offer explanations, a fatigued and harassed, but perfectly\r\nvirtuous and exemplary woman. Vincent, who had not realised his sister\'s\r\nextreme peril, and who was rather disconcerted by this fresh invasion of\r\nhis house, opened the door of his sitting-room for her with more\r\nannoyance than hospitality. His own affairs were urgent in his mind. He\r\ncould not keep his thoughts from dwelling upon Salem and what had\r\noccurred there, though no one else thought of it. Had he known the\r\ndanger in which his sister lay, his heart might have rejected every\r\nsecondary matter. But the minister did not know that Susan had been\r\nsinking into the last apathy when this sudden arrival saved her. He gave\r\nMiss Smith the easy-chair by the fire, and listened with an appearance\r\nof attention, but with little real understanding, to her lengthy and\r\nperplexed story. She was all in a flutter, the good governess said:\r\neverything was so mysterious and out of the way, she did not know what\r\nto think. Little Alice\'s mamma, Miss Russell that was, Mrs. Mildmay she\r\nmeant, had brought the child back to her after that dreadful business at\r\nDover. What was the rights of that business, could Mr. Vincent tell her?\r\nColonel Mildmay was getting better, she knew, and it was not a murder;\r\nand she was heartbroken when she heard the trouble poor dear Miss\r\nVincent had got into about it. Well, Alice\'s mamma brought back the\r\nchild, and they started with her at once to France. They went up beyond\r\nLyons to the hills, an out-of-the-way little place, but Mrs. Mildmay was\r\nalways so nervous. "And then she left us, Mr. Vincent," said the\r\nafflicted governess, as the minister, in grievous impatience, kept\r\npacing up and down the room thus occupied and taken possession of--"left\r\nus without a soul to speak to or a church within reach; and if there is\r\none thing I have more horror of than another for its effect upon the\r\nyouthful mind, it is Popery, which is so seductive to the imagination.\r\nAlice did not take to her mamma, Mr. Vincent. It was natural enough, but\r\nit was hard upon Mrs. Mildmay: she never had a good way with children;\r\nand from the moment we started till now, it has been impossible to get\r\nyour sister out of the child\'s mind. She took a fancy to her the moment\r\nshe saw her. Girls of that age, if you will not think it strange of me\r\nto say so, very often fall in love with a girl older than\r\nthemselves--quite fall in love, though it is a strange thing to say.\r\nAlice would not rest--she gave me no peace. I wrote to say so, but I\r\nthink Mrs. Mildmay could not have got my letter. The child would have\r\nrun away by herself if I had not brought her. Besides," said Miss Smith,\r\napologetically, "the doctors have assured me that, if she ever became\r\nmuch interested in any one, or attached to anybody in particular, she\r\nwas not to be crossed. It was the best chance for her mind, the doctors\r\nsaid. What could I do? What do you think I could do, Mr. Vincent? I\r\nbrought her home, for I could not help myself--otherwise she would have\r\nrun away. She has a very strong will, though she looks so gentle. I hope\r\nyou will help me to explain the circumstances to Mrs. Mildmay, and how\r\nit was I came back without her authority. Don\'t you think they ought to\r\ncall in the friends on both sides and come to some arrangement, Mr.\r\nVincent?" said the excellent woman, anxiously. "I know she trusts you\r\nvery much, and it was she herself who gave me your address."\r\n\r\nTo this speech Vincent listened with an impatience and restlessness\r\nwhich he found it impossible to conceal. He paced about the darker end\r\nof his room, on the other side of that table, where the lamp shone\r\nvacantly upon his open desk and scattered papers, answering now and then\r\nwith a mono-syllable of reluctant courtesy, irritated and disturbed\r\nbeyond expression by the perfectly serious and proper figure seated by\r\nthe fire. Somebody might come from that assembly which had met to\r\ndiscuss him, and he could not be alone to receive them. In the annoyance\r\nof the moment the minister almost chafed at his sister and her concerns.\r\nHis life was invaded by these women, with their mysteries and agonies.\r\nHe listened to the steps outside, thinking every moment to hear the\r\nsteady tramp of the deputation from Salem, or at least Tozer, whom it\r\nwould have been balm to his mind, in the height of the good man\'s\r\ntriumph, to cut short and annihilate. But how do that, or anything else,\r\nwith this woman seated by his fire explaining her unintelligible\r\naffairs? Such was Vincent\'s state of mind while his mother, in an agony\r\nof joy, was hearing from Susan\'s lips, for the first time, broken\r\nexplanations of those few days of her life which outbalanced in terrible\r\nimportance all its preceding years. The minister did not know that his\r\nsister\'s very existence, as well as her reason, hung upon that\r\nunhoped-for opening of her mouth and her heart.\r\n\r\nMatters were not much mended when Dr. Rider came in, beaming and\r\nradiant, full of congratulations. Susan was saved. It was the most\r\ncurious psychological puzzle, the doctor said; all her life had got\r\nconcentrated into the few days between her departure from Lonsdale and\r\nher arrival at Carlingford. Neither her old existence, nor the objects\r\nthat surrounded her at the moment, had any significance for Susan; only\r\nsomething that belonged to that wonderful interval in which she had\r\nbeen driven desperate, could win back consciousness to her mind. It was\r\nthe most singular case he had ever met with; but he knew this was the\r\nonly way of treating it, and so it had proved. He recognised the girl\r\nwith the blue veil the moment he saw her--he knew it could be no other.\r\nWho was she? where had she sprung from at that critical moment? where\r\nhad she been? what was to be done with her? Dr. Rider poured forth his\r\nquestions like a stream. He was full of professional triumph, not to say\r\nnatural satisfaction. He could not understand how his patient\'s brother,\r\nat that wonderful crisis, could have a mind preoccupied or engaged with\r\nother things. The doctor turned with lively sympathy and curiosity from\r\nthe anxious Nonconformist to Miss Smith, who was but too willing to\r\nbegin all her explanations over again. Dr. Rider, accustomed to hear\r\nmany personal narratives, collected this story a great deal more clearly\r\nthan Vincent, who was so much more interested in it, had, with all his\r\nopportunities, been able to do. How long the poor minister might have\r\nsuffered under this conversation, it is impossible to tell. But Mrs.\r\nVincent, in all the agitation of her daughter\'s deliverance, could not\r\nforget the griefs of others. She sent a little message to her son,\r\nbegging that he would send word of this arrival to "the poor lady." "To\r\nlet her know--but she must not come here to-night," was the widow\'s\r\nmessage, who was just then having the room darkened, and everything\r\narranged for the night, if perhaps her child might sleep. This message\r\ndelivered the minister; it recalled Miss Smith to her duty. She it was\r\nwho must go and explain everything to her patroness. Dr. Rider, whose\r\nmuch-excited wonder was still further stimulated by hearing that the\r\nchild\'s mother was at Lady Western\'s, that she was Mrs. Mildmay, and\r\nthat the Nonconformist was in her confidence, cheerfully undertook to\r\ncarry the governess in his drag to Grange Lane, not without hopes of\r\nfurther information; and it was now getting late. Miss Smith made\r\nVincent a tremulous curtsy, and held out her hand to him to say\r\ngood-night. "The doctor will perhaps explain to Mrs. Mildmay why I have\r\nleft little Alice," said the troubled woman. "I never left her before\r\nsince she was intrusted to me--never but when her papa stole her away;\r\nand you are a minister, Mr. Vincent, and oh, I hope I am doing quite\r\nright, and as Alice\'s mamma will approve! But if she disapproves I must\r\ncome back and----"\r\n\r\n"They must not be disturbed to-night," said Dr. Rider, promptly; "I will\r\nsee Mrs. Mildmay." He was not reluctant to see Mrs. Mildmay. The doctor,\r\nthough he was not a gossip, was not inaccessible to the pleasure of\r\nknowing more than anybody else of the complications of this strange\r\nbusiness, which still afforded matter of talk to Carlingford. He hurried\r\nher away while still the good governess was all in a flutter, and for\r\nthe first time the minister was left alone. It was with a troubled mind\r\nthat the young man resumed his seat at his desk. He began to get utterly\r\nweary of this business, and all about it. If he could only have swept\r\naway in a whirlwind, with his mother and sister, where the name of\r\nMildmay had never been heard of, and where he could for ever get rid of\r\nthat haunting woman with her gleaming eyes, who had pursued even his\r\ngentle mother to the door! but this new complication seemed to involve\r\nhim deeper than ever in those strange bonds. It was with a certain\r\ndisgust that the minister thought it all over as he sat leaning his head\r\non his hands. His way was dark before him, yet it must speedily be\r\ndecided. Everything was at a crisis in his excited mind and troubled\r\nlife--even that strange lovely child\'s face, which had roused Susan from\r\nher apathy, had its share in the excitement of her brother\'s thoughts;\r\nfor it was but another version, with differences, of the face of that\r\nother Alice, who all unwittingly had procured for Vincent the sweetest\r\nand the hardest hours he had spent in Carlingford. Were they all to pass\r\nlike a dream--her smiles, her sweet looks, her kind words, even that\r\nmagical touch upon his arm, which had once charmed him out of all his\r\ntroubles? A groan came out of the young man\'s heart, not loud, but deep,\r\nas that thought moved him. The very despair of this love-dream had been\r\nmore exquisite than any pleasure of his life. Was it all to pass away\r\nand be no longer? Life and thought, the actual and the visionary, had\r\nboth come to a climax, and seemed to stand still, waiting the decision\r\nwhich must be come to that night.\r\n\r\nFrom these musings the entrance of Tozer roused the minister. The\r\nexcellent butterman came in all flushed and glowing from his success. To\r\nhim, the meeting, which already the Nonconformist had half lost sight of\r\nunder the superstructure of subsequent events, had newly concluded, and\r\nwas the one occurrence of the time. The cheers which had hailed him\r\nmaster of the field were still ringing in Tozer\'s ears. "I don\'t deny as\r\nI am intoxicated-like," said the excellent deacon; "them cheers was\r\nenough to carry any man off his legs, sir, if you\'ll believe me. We\'ve\r\nscattered the enemy, that\'s what we\'ve been and done, Mr. Vincent. There\r\nain\'t one of them as will dare show face in Salem. We was unanimous,\r\nsir--unanimous, that\'s what we was! I never see such a triumph in our\r\nconnection. Hurrah! If it warn\'t Miss as is ill, I could give it you all\r\nover again, cheers and all."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you were pleased," said Vincent, with an effort; "but I will\r\nnot ask you for such a report of the proceedings."\r\n\r\n"Pleased! I\'ll tell you one thing as I was sorry for, sir," said Tozer,\r\nsomewhat subdued in his exultation by the pastor\'s calmness--"I did it\r\nfor the best; but seeing as things have turned out so well, I am as\r\nsorry as I can be--and that is, that you wasn\'t there. It was from\r\nexpecting some unpleasantness as I asked you not to come; but things\r\nturning out as they did, it would have done your heart good to see \'em,\r\nMr. Vincent. Salem folks has a deal of sense when you put things before\r\nthem effective. And then you\'d only have had to say three words to them\r\non the spur of the moment, and all was settled and done with, and\r\neverything put straight; which would have let them settle down steady,\r\nsir, at once, and not kept no excitement, as it were, hanging about."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the minister, who was moving about his papers, and did not\r\nlook up. The butterman began to be alarmed; he grew more and more\r\nenthusiastic the less response he met with.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a meeting as will tell in the connection," said Tozer, with\r\nunconscious foresight; "a candid mind in a congregation ain\'t so general\r\nas you and me would like to see, Mr. Vincent, and it takes a bit of a\r\ntrial like this, sir, and opposition, to bring out the real attachment\r\nas is between a pastor and a flock."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Vincent again. The deacon did not know what to make of the\r\nminister. Had he been piqued and angry, Tozer thought he might have\r\nknown how to manage him, but this coldness was an alarming and\r\nmysterious symptom which he was unequal to. In his embarrassment and\r\nanxiety the good butterman stumbled upon the very subject from which,\r\nhad he known the true state of affairs, he would have kept aloof.\r\n\r\n"And the meeting as was to be to-morrow night?" said Tozer; "there ain\'t\r\nno need for explanation now--a word or two out of the pulpit is all as\r\nis wanted, just to say as it\'s all over, and you\'re grateful for their\r\nattachment, and so forth; you know a deal better, sir, how to do it nor\r\nme. And about the meeting as was called for to-morrow night?--me and the\r\nmisses were thinking, though it\'s sudden, as it might be turned into a\r\ntea-meeting, if you was agreeable, just to make things pleasant; or if\r\nthat ain\'t according to your fancy, as I\'m aware you\'re not one as likes\r\ntea-meetings, we might send round, Mr. Vincent to all the seat-holders\r\nto say as it\'s given up; I\'d do one or the other, if you\'d be advised by\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Thank you--but I can\'t do either one or the other," said the\r\nNonconformist. "I would not have asked the people to meet me if I had\r\nnot had something to say to them--and this night\'s business, you\r\nunderstand," said Vincent, with a little pride, "has made no difference\r\nin me."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, no--to be sure not," said the perplexed butterman, much\r\nbewildered; "but two meetings on two nights consecutive is running the\r\nflock hard, it is. I\'d give up to-morrow, Mr. Vincent, if I was you."\r\n\r\nTo this insinuating address the minister made no answer--he only shook\r\nhis head. Poor Tozer, out of his exultation, fell again into the depths.\r\nThe blow was so unlooked-for that it overwhelmed him.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll not go and make no reflections, sir?" said the troubled deacon;\r\n"bygones is bygones. You\'ll not bring it up against them, as they didn\'t\r\nshow that sympathy they might have done? You\'ll not make no reference to\r\nnobody in particular, Mr. Vincent? When a flock is conscious as they\'ve\r\ndone their duty and stood by their pastor, it ain\'t a safe thing, sir,\r\nnot to turn upon them, and rake up things as is past. If you\'ll take my\r\nadvice, sir, as wishes you well, and hasn\'t no motive but your good, I\'d\r\nnot hold that meeting, Mr. Vincent; or, if you\'re bent upon it, say the\r\nword, and we\'ll set to work and give \'em a tea-meeting, and make all\r\nthings comfortable. But if you was prudent, sir, and would go by my\r\nadvice, one or the other of them two is what I would do."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Tozer, all the same," said Vincent, who, notwithstanding his\r\npreoccupation, saw the good butterman\'s anxiety, and appreciated it. "I\r\nknow very well that all that is pleasant to-night is owing to you. Don\'t\r\nsuppose I don\'t understand how you\'ve fought for me; but now the\r\nbusiness is mine, and I can take no more advice. Think no more of it;\r\nyou have done all that you could do."\r\n\r\n"I have done my humble endeavour, sir, as is my dooty, to keep things\r\nstraight," said the deacon, doubtfully; "and if you\'d tell me what was\r\nin your mind, Mr. Vincent----?"\r\n\r\nBut the young Nonconformist gathered up his papers, closed his desk, and\r\nheld out his hand to the kind-hearted butterman. "My sister has come\r\nback almost from the grave to-night," said Vincent; "and we are all, for\r\nanything I can see, at the turning-point of our lives. You have done all\r\nyou can do, and I thank you heartily; but now the business is in my\r\nhands."\r\n\r\nThis was all the satisfaction Tozer got from the minister. He went home\r\nmuch discouraged, not knowing what to make of it, but did not confide\r\nhis fears even to his wife, hoping that reflection would change the\r\npastor\'s mind, and resolved to make another effort to-morrow. And so the\r\nnight fell over the troubled house. In the sick-room a joyful agitation\r\nhad taken the place of the dark and hopeless calm. Susan, roused to\r\nlife, lay leaning against her mother, looking at the child asleep on the\r\nsofa by her, unconscious of the long and terrible interval between the\r\ndanger which that child had shared, and the delicious security to which\r\nher mind had all at once awakened. To Susan\'s consciousness, it appeared\r\nas if her mother had suddenly risen out of the mists, and delivered the\r\ntwo helpless creatures who had suffered together. She could not press\r\nclose enough to this guardian of her life. She held her arms round her,\r\nand laid her cheek against the widow\'s with the dependence of a child\r\nupon her mother\'s bosom. Mrs. Vincent sat upon the bed supporting her,\r\nherself supported in her weariness by love and joy, two divine\r\nattendants who go but seldom together. The two talked in\r\nwhispers,--Susan because of her feebleness, the mother in the instinct\r\nof caressing tenderness. The poor girl told her story in broken\r\nsyllables--broken by the widow\'s kisses and murmurs of sympathy, of\r\nwonder and love. Healing breathed upon the stricken mind and feeble\r\nframe as the two clung together in the silent night, always with an\r\nunspoken reference to the beautiful forlorn creature on the sofa--that\r\nvisible symbol of all the terrors and troubles past. "I told her my\r\nmother would come to save us," said poor Susan. When she dropt to sleep\r\nat last, the mother leant her aching frame upon some pillows, afraid to\r\nmove, and slept too, supreme protector, in her tender weakness, of these\r\ntwo young lives. As she woke from time to time to see her child sleeping\r\nby her side, thoughts of her son\'s deliverance stole across Mrs.\r\nVincent\'s mind to sweeten her repose. The watch-light burned dimly in\r\nthe room, and threw a gigantic shadow of her little figure, half erect\r\non the side of the bed, still in her black gown and the close white cap,\r\nwhich could not be less than dainty in its neatness, even in that vigil,\r\nupon the further wall. The widow slept only in snatches, waking often\r\nand keeping awake, as people do when they grow old; her thoughts, ever\r\nalive and active, varying between her projects for the future, to save\r\nSusan from all painful knowledge of her own story, and the thankful\r\nrecollection of Arthur\'s rescue from his troubles. From echoes of\r\nTozer\'s speech, and of the cheers of the flock, her imagination wandered\r\noff into calculations of how she could find another place of habitation\r\nas pleasant, perhaps, as Lonsdale, and even to the details of her\r\nremoval from thence, what portions of her furniture she would sell, and\r\nwhich take with her. "For now that Arthur has got out of his troubles,\r\nwe must not stay to get him into fresh difficulties with his flock," she\r\nsaid to herself, with a momentary ache in her thankful heart; and so\r\ndropped asleep for another half-hour, to wake again presently, and enter\r\nanew into the whole question. Such was the way in which Mrs. Vincent\r\npassed that agitated but joyful night.\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining room Arthur sat up late over his papers. He was not\r\nwriting, or doing any work; for hours together he sat leaning his head\r\non his hands, gazing intently at the lamp, which his mother had\r\nadjusted, until his eyes were dazzled, and the gloom of the room around\r\nbecame spotted with discs of shade. Was he to permit the natural\r\ngratification into which Tozer\'s success had reluctantly moved him, to\r\nalter his resolve? Was he to drop into his old harness and try again? or\r\nwas he to carry out his purpose in the face of all entreaties and\r\ninducements? The natural inclination to adopt the easiest course--and\r\nthe equally natural, impetuous, youthful impulse to take the leap to\r\nwhich he had made up his mind, and dash forth in the face of his\r\ndifficulties--gave him abundant occupation for his thoughts as they\r\ncontended against each other. He sat arguing the question within himself\r\nlong after his fire had sunk into ashes. When the penetrating cold of\r\nthe night drove him at last to bed, the question was still dubious. Even\r\nin his sleep the uneasy perplexity pursued him;--a matter momentous\r\nenough, though nobody but Tozer--who was as restless as the minister,\r\nand disturbed his wife by groans and murmurs, of which, when indignantly\r\nwoke up to render an account, he could give no explanation--knew or\r\nsuspected anything. Whether to take up his anchors altogether and launch\r\nout upon that sea of life, of which, much as he had discussed it in his\r\nsermons, the young Nonconformist knew next to nothing? The widow would\r\nnot have mused so quietly with her wakeful eyes in the dim room next to\r\nhim, had she known what discussions were going on in Arthur\'s mind. As\r\nfor the congregation of Salem, they slept soundly, with an exhilarating\r\nsensation of generosity and goodness,--all except the Pigeons, who were\r\nplotting schism, and had already in their eye a vacant Temperance Hall,\r\nwhere a new preaching station might be organised under the auspices of\r\nsomebody who would rival Vincent. The triumphant majority, however,\r\nlaughed at the poulterer, and anticipated, with a pleasurable\r\nexpectation, the meeting of next night, and the relief and delight of\r\nthe pastor, who would find he had no explanations to make, but only his\r\nthanks to render to his generous flock. The good people concluded that\r\nthey would all stop to shake hands with him after the business was over.\r\n"For it\'s as good as receiving of him again, and giving him the right\r\nhand of fellowship," said Mrs. Brown at the Dairy, who was entirely won\r\nover to the minister\'s side. Only Tozer, groaning in his midnight\r\nvisions, and disturbing the virtuous repose of his wedded partner,\r\nsuspected the new cloud that hung over Salem. For before morning the\r\nminister\'s mind was finally made up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day dawned amid the agitations natural to such a crisis of\r\naffairs. Almost before it was daylight, before Susan had woke, or the\r\nyoung stranger stirred upon her sofa, Miss Smith, troubled and\r\nexemplary, had returned to see after her charge. Miss Smith was in a\r\nstate of much anxiety and discomfort till she had explained to Mrs.\r\nVincent all the strange circumstances in which she found herself; and\r\nthe widow, who had ventured to rise from Susan\'s side, and had been\r\nnoiselessly busy putting the room in order, that her child might see\r\nnothing that was not cheerful and orderly when she woke, was not without\r\ncuriosity to hear, and gladly took this opportunity, before even Arthur\r\nwas stirring, to understand, if she could, the story which was so\r\nconnected with that of her children. She ventured to go into the next\r\nroom with Miss Smith, where she could hear every movement in the\r\nsick-chamber. The widow found it hard to understand all the tale. That\r\nMrs. Hilyard was Mildmay\'s wife, and that it was their child who had\r\nsought protection of all the world from Susan Vincent, whom the crimes\r\nof her father and mother had driven to the very verge of the grave, was\r\nso hard and difficult to comprehend, that all the governess\'s anxious\r\ndetails of how little Alice first came into her hands, of her mother\'s\r\nmotives for concealing her from Colonel Mildmay, even of the ill-fated\r\nflight to Lonsdale, which, instead of keeping her safe, had carried the\r\nchild into her father\'s very presence--and all the subsequent events\r\nwhich Miss Smith had already confided to the minister, fell but dully\r\nupon the ears of Susan\'s mother. "Her daughter--and his daughter--and\r\nshe comes to take refuge with my child," said the widow, with a swelling\r\nheart. Mrs. Vincent did not know what secret it was that lay heavy on\r\nthe soul of the desperate woman who had followed her last night from\r\nGrove Street, but somehow, with a female instinct, felt, though she did\r\nnot understand, that Mrs. Hilyard or Mrs. Mildmay, whatever her name\r\nmight be, was as guilty in respect to Susan as was her guilty\r\nhusband--the man who had stolen like a serpent into the Lonsdale cottage\r\nand won the poor girl\'s simple heart. Full of curiosity as she was, the\r\nwidow\'s thoughts wandered off from Miss Smith\'s narrative; her heart\r\nswelled within her with an innocent triumph; the good had overcome the\r\nevil. This child, over whom its father and mother had fought with so\r\ndeadly a struggle, had flown for protection to Susan, whom that father\r\nand mother had done their utmost to ruin and destroy. They had not\r\nsucceeded, thank God! Through the desert and the lions the widow\'s Una\r\nhad come victorious, stretching her tender virgin shield over this poor\r\nchild of passion and sorrow. While Miss Smith maundered through the\r\nentire history, starting from the time when Miss Russell married Colonel\r\nMildmay, the widow\'s mind was entirely occupied with this wonderful\r\nvictory of innocence over wickedness. She forgot the passionate despair\r\nof the mother whose child did not recognise her. She began immediately\r\nto contrive, with unguarded generosity, how Susan and she, when they\r\nleft Carlingford, should carry the stranger along with them, and nurse\r\nher clouded mind into full development. Mrs. Vincent\'s trials had not\r\nyet taught her any practical lessons of worldly wisdom. Her heart was\r\nstill as open as when, unthinking of evil, she admitted the false Mr.\r\nFordham into her cottage, and made a beginning of all the misery which\r\nseemed now, to her sanguine heart, to be passing away. She went back to\r\nSusan\'s room full of this plan--full of tender thoughts towards the girl\r\nwho had chosen Susan for her protector, and of pride and joy still more\r\ntender in her own child, who had overcome evil. It was, perhaps, the\r\nsweetest solace which could have been offered, after all her troubles,\r\nto the minister\'s mother. It was at once a vindication of the hard\r\n"dealings" of Providence, and of that strength of innocence and purity,\r\nin which the little woman believed with all her heart.\r\n\r\nThe minister himself was much less agreeably moved when he found the\r\ngoverness in possession of his sitting-room. Anything more utterly\r\nvexatious could hardly have occurred to Vincent than to find this\r\ntroubled good woman, herself much embarrassed and disturbed by her own\r\nposition, seated at his breakfast-table on this eventful morning. Miss\r\nSmith was as primly uncomfortable as it was natural for an elderly\r\nsingle woman, still conscious of the fact that she was unmarried, to be,\r\nin an absolute t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate with a young man. She, poor lady, was as near\r\nblushing as her grey and composed non-complexion would permit. She moved\r\nuneasily in her seat, and made tremulous explanations, as Vincent, who\r\nwas too young and inexperienced to be absolutely uncourteous, took his\r\nplace opposite to her. "I am sure I feel quite an intruder," said poor\r\nMiss Smith; "but your mother, Mr. Vincent, and little Alice--and indeed\r\nI did not know I was to be left here alone. It must seem so odd to you\r\nto find a lady--dear, dear me! I feel I am quite in the way," said the\r\nembarrassed governess; "but Mrs. Mildmay will be here presently. I know\r\nshe will be here directly. I am sure she would have come with me had she\r\nknown. But she sat up half the night hearing what I had to tell her, and\r\ndropped asleep just in the morning. She is wonderfully changed, Mr.\r\nVincent--very, very much changed. She is so nervous--a thing I never\r\ncould have looked for. I suppose, after all, married ladies, however\r\nmuch they may object to their husbands, can\'t help feeling a little when\r\nanything happens," continued Miss Smith, primly; "and there is something\r\nso dreadful in such an accident. How do you think it can have happened?\r\nCould it be his groom, or who could it be? but I understand he is\r\ngetting better now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe so," said Vincent.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad," said Miss Smith, "not that if it had been the will of\r\nProvidence.--I would make the tea for you, Mr. Vincent, if you would not\r\nthink it odd, and I am sure Mrs. Mildmay will be here directly. They\r\nwere in a great commotion at Grange Lane. Just now, you know, there is\r\nan excitement. Though she is not a young girl, to be sure it is always\r\nnatural. But for that I am sure they would all have come this morning;\r\nbut perhaps Mr. Fordham----"\r\n\r\n"Not any tea, thank you. If you have breakfasted, I will have the things\r\nremoved. I have only one sitting-room, you perceive," said the minister,\r\nrather bitterly. He could not be positively uncivil--his heart was too\r\nyoung and fresh to be rude to any woman; but he rang the bell with a\r\nlittle unnecessary sharpness when Miss Smith protested that she had\r\nbreakfasted long before. Her words excited him with a touch beyond\r\ntelling. He could not, would not ask what was the cause of the commotion\r\nin Grange Lane; but he walked to the window to collect himself while the\r\nlittle maid cleared the table, and, throwing it open, looked out with\r\nthe heart beating loud in his breast. Were these the bells of St.\r\nRoque\'s chiming into the ruddy sunny air with a confused jangle of joy?\r\nIt was a saint\'s day, no doubt--a festival which the perpetual curate\r\ntook delight in proclaiming his observance of; or--if it might happen to\r\nbe anything else, what was that to the minister of Salem, who had so\r\nmany other things on his mind? As he looked out a cab drove rapidly up\r\nto the door--a cab from which he saw emerge Mrs. Hilyard and another\r\nfigure, which he recognised with a start of resentment. What possible\r\nright had this man to intrude upon him in this moment of fate? The\r\nminister left the window hastily, and stationed himself with a gloomy\r\ncountenance on the hearthrug. He might be impatient of the women; but\r\nFordham, inexcusable as his intrusion was, had to be met face to face.\r\nWith a flash of sudden recollection, he recalled all his previous\r\nintercourse with the stranger whose name was so bitterly inter-woven\r\nwith the history of the last six months. What had he ever done to wake\r\nso sharp a pang of dislike and injury in Vincent\'s mind? It was not for\r\nSusan\'s sake that her brother\'s heart closed and his countenance clouded\r\nagainst the man whose name had wrought her so much sorrow. Vincent had\r\narrived at such a climax of personal existence that Susan had but a dim\r\nand secondary place in his thoughts. He was absorbed in his own troubles\r\nand plans and miseries. On the eve of striking out for himself into that\r\nbitter and unknown life in which his inexperienced imagination rejected\r\nthe thought of any solace yet remaining, what malicious influence\r\nbrought this man here?\r\n\r\nThey came in together into the room, "Mrs. Mildmay and Mr. Fordham"--not\r\nMrs. Hilyard: that was over; and, preoccupied as the minister was, he\r\ncould not but perceive the sudden change which had come over the Back\r\nGrove Street needlewoman. Perhaps her despair had lasted as long as was\r\npossible for such an impatient spirit. She came in with the firm, steady\r\nstep which he had observed long ago, before she had begun to tremble at\r\nhis eye. Another new stage had commenced in her strange life. She went\r\nup to him without any hesitation, clear and decisive as of old.\r\n\r\n"I am going away," she said, holding out her hand to him, "and so I\r\npresume are you, Mr. Vincent. I have come to explain everything and see\r\nyour mother. Let me see your mother. Mr. Fordham has come with me to\r\nexplain to you. They think in Grange Lane that it is only a man who can\r\nspeak to a man," she went on, with the old movement of her thin lips;\r\n"and that now I have come to life again, I must not manage my own\r\naffairs. I am going back to society and the world, Mr. Vincent. I do not\r\nknow where you are going, but here is somebody come to answer for me. Do\r\nthey accept bail in a court of honour? or will you still hold a woman to\r\nher parole? for it must be settled now."\r\n\r\n"Why must it be settled now?" said Vincent. He had dropped her hand and\r\nturned away from her with a certain repugnance. She had lost her power\r\nover him. At that moment the idea of being cruel, tyrannical to\r\nsomebody--using his power harshly, balancing the pain in his own heart\r\nby inflicting pain on another--was not unagreeable to the minister\'s\r\nexcited mind. He could have steeled himself just then to bring down upon\r\nher all the horrible penalties of the law. "Why must it be settled?" he\r\nrepeated; "why must you leave Carlingford? I will not permit it." He\r\nspoke to her, but he looked at Fordham. The stranger was wrapped in a\r\nlarge overcoat which concealed all his dress. What was his dress, or\r\nhis aspect, or the restrained brightness in his eyes to the minister of\r\nSalem? But Vincent watched him narrowly with a jealous inspection. In\r\nFordham\'s whole appearance there was the air of a man to whom something\r\nwas about to happen, which aggravated to the fever-point the dislike and\r\nopposition in Vincent\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I will be answerable for Mrs. Mildmay," said Fordham, with an evident\r\nresponse on his side to that opposition and dislike. Then he paused,\r\nevidently perceiving the necessity of conciliation. "Mr. Vincent," he\r\ncontinued, with some earnestness, "we all understand and regret deeply\r\nthe inconvenience-- I mean the suffering--that is to say, the injury and\r\nmisery which these late occurrences must have caused you. I know how\r\nwell--that is, how generously, how nobly--you have behaved----"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Fordham came to a pause in some confusion. To express calm\r\nacknowledgments to a man for his conduct in a matter which has been to\r\nhim one of unmitigated disaster and calamity, requires an amount of\r\ncomposure which few people possess when at the height of personal\r\nhappiness. The minister drew back, and, with a slight bow, and a\r\nrestraint which was very natural and not unbecoming in his\r\ncircumstances, looked on at the confusion of the speaker without any\r\nattempt to relieve it. He had offered seats to his visitors, but he\r\nhimself stood on the hearthrug, dark and silent, giving no assistance in\r\nthe explanation. He had not invited the explanation--it must be managed\r\nnow as the others might, without any help from him.\r\n\r\n"I have seen Colonel Mildmay," continued Mr. Fordham, after a confused\r\npause. "If it can be any atonement to you to know how much he regrets\r\nall that has happened, so far as your family is concerned--how fully he\r\nexonerates Miss Vincent, who was all along deceived, and who would not\r\nhave remained a moment with him had she not been forcibly detained.\r\nMildmay declares she met with nothing but respect at his hands,"\r\ncontinued the embarrassed advocate, lowering his voice; "he says----"\r\n\r\n"Enough has been said on the subject," said Vincent, restraining himself\r\nwith a violent effort.\r\n\r\n"Yes--I beg your pardon, it is quite true--enough has been said," cried\r\nFordham, with an appearance of relief. Here, at least, was one part of\r\nhis difficult mediation over. "Mildmay will not," he resumed, after a\r\npause, "tell me or any one else who it was that gave him his wound--that\r\nis a secret, he says, between him and his God--and another. Whoever that\r\nother may be," continued Fordham, with a quick look towards Mrs.\r\nMildmay, "he is conscious of having wronged--him--and will take no steps\r\nagainst--him. This culprit, it appears, must be permitted to escape--you\r\nthink so?--worse evils might be involved if we were to\r\ndemand--his--punishment. Mr. Vincent, I beg you to take this into\r\nconsideration. It could be no advantage to you; the innocent shall not\r\nsuffer--but--the criminal--must be permitted to escape."\r\n\r\n"I do not see the necessity," said Vincent between his teeth.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Mrs. Mildmay, suddenly. "Escape! who believes in escape?\r\nMr. Vincent knows better. Hush, you are a happy man just now--you are\r\nnot qualified to judge; but we know better. Escape!--he means from\r\nprisons, and such like," she continued, turning to Vincent with a\r\nhalf-disdainful wave of her hand towards her companion. "But you know,\r\nand so do I, that there is no escape--not in this world. I know nothing\r\nabout the next," said the strange woman, curbing once more the flush of\r\nexcitement which had overpowered her as she spoke--"nothing; neither do\r\nyou, though you are a priest. But there is enough of retribution here.\r\nThe criminal--Mr. Vincent--you know--will not escape."\r\n\r\nShe spoke these last words panting, with pauses between, for breath. She\r\nwas afraid of him again; his blankness, his passive opposition, drove\r\nher out of her composure. She put her hands together under her shawl\r\nwith a certain dumb entreaty, and fixed upon him her eager eyes. They\r\nwere a strange group altogether. Miss Smith, who had still lingered at\r\nthe door, notwithstanding Mrs. Mildmay\'s imperative gesture of\r\ndismissal--out of hearing, but not out of sight--suffered some little\r\nsound to escape her at this critical moment; and when her patroness\r\nturned round upon her with those dreadful eyes, fled with precipitation,\r\ntaking refuge in Mrs. Vincent\'s room. The table, still covered with its\r\nwhite cloth, stood between that dismayed spectator before she\r\ndisappeared finally, and the little company who were engaged in this\r\nsilent conflict. Beside it sat Mrs. Mildmay, with a renewed panic of\r\nfear rising in her face. Fordham, considerably disturbed, and not\r\nknowing what to say, stood near her buttoning and unbuttoning his\r\novercoat with impatient fingers, anxious to help her, but still more\r\nanxious to be gone. The minister stood facing them all, with compressed\r\nlips, and eyes which looked at nobody. He was wrapt in a silent dumb\r\nresistance to all entreaties and arguments, watching Fordham\'s gestures,\r\nFordham\'s looks, with a jealous but secret suspicion. His heart was\r\ncruel in its bitterness. He for whom Providence had no joys in store, to\r\nwhom the light was fading which made life sweet, was for this moment\r\nsuperior to the happy man who stood embarrassed and impatient before\r\nhim; and generous as his real nature was, it was not in him, in this\r\nmoment of darkness, to let the opportunity go.\r\n\r\n"The innocent have suffered already," said Vincent, "all but madness,\r\nall but death. Why should the criminal escape?--go back into society,\r\nthe society of good people, perhaps strike some one else more\r\neffectually? Why should I betray justice, and let the criminal escape?\r\nMy sister\'s honour and safety are mine, and shall be guarded, whoever\r\nsuffers. I will not permit her to go."\r\n\r\n"But I offer to be answerable for her appearance," said Fordham,\r\nhastily. "I undertake to produce her if need be. You know me. I am a--a\r\nrelation of the family. I am a man sufficiently known to satisfy any\r\nmagistrate. You have no legal right to detain her. What would you have\r\nmore? Is not my guarantee enough for you?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Vincent, slowly. The two men stood defiant opposite to each\r\nother, contending for this woman, whom neither of them looked at, for\r\nwhom neither of them cared. She, in the mean time, sat still in an agony\r\nof suspense and concealed anguish, with her eyes fixed on Vincent\'s\r\nface. She knew very well it was not of her that either of the two was\r\nthinking; yet it was her fate, perhaps her very life, which hung\r\ntrembling in the balance. A smothered sighing sob came from her breast.\r\nShe was silenced for the first time in her life. She had escaped her\r\ncrime; but all its material consequences, shame and punishment, still\r\nhung over her head. After God himself had freed her from the guilt of\r\nblood--after the injured man himself had forgiven her--when all was\r\nclear for her escape into another life--was this an indignant angel,\r\nwith flaming sword and averted face, that barred the way of the\r\nfugitive? Beyond him, virtue and goodness, and all the fruits of\r\nrepentance, shone before the eyes which had up to this time seen but\r\nlittle attraction in them--all so sweet, so easy, so certain, if but she\r\nwere free. Her worn heart sighed to get forth into that way of peace.\r\nShe could have fallen on her knees before the stern judge who kept her\r\nback, and held over her head the cloud of her own ill-doings, but dared\r\nnot, in her paroxysm of fear and half-despair. A groaning, sighing sob,\r\ninterrupted and broken, came from her exhausted breast. Just as she had\r\nrecovered herself--as she had escaped--as remorse and misery had driven\r\nher to yearn after a better life, to be cast down again into this abyss\r\nof guilt and punishment! She trembled violently as she clasped her poor\r\nhands under her shawl. Composure and self-restraint were impossible in\r\nthis terrible suspense.\r\n\r\nHer cry went to Fordham\'s heart; and, besides, he was in desperate\r\nhaste, and could afford to sink his pride, and make an appeal for once.\r\nHe made a step forward, and put out his hand with an entreating gesture.\r\n"Do you hear her?" he cried, suddenly. "You have had much to bear\r\nyourself; have pity on her. Let her off--leave her to God. She has been\r\nill, and will die if you have no mercy. You who are a minister----"\r\n\r\nIn his energy his overcoat fell back for a moment; underneath he was in\r\nfull dress, which showed strangely in that grey spring morning. Vincent\r\nturned round upon him with a smile. The young man\'s face was utterly\r\npale, white to the lips. The bells were jangling joy in his ears. He was\r\nnot master of himself. "We detain you, Mr. Fordham; you have other\r\naffairs in hand," he said. "I am a minister only--a Dissenting\r\nminister--unworthy to have such an intercessor pleading with me; but\r\nyou, at least," cried poor Vincent, with an attempt at sarcasm, "do not\r\nwant my pity; there is nothing between us that requires explanation. I\r\nwill arrange with Mrs. Mildmay alone." He turned away and went to the\r\nwindow when he had spoken. There he stood, with his back to them,\r\nlistening to the bells of St. Roque\'s, as they came and went in\r\nirregular breaks upon the wind. His heart was bursting with wild throbs\r\nof bitterness and despair; it was all he could do to keep the tumult\r\ndown, and contain himself in that flush of passion. He turned away from\r\nthem, and stood gazing out at that tedious window into the blank world.\r\nWhat did it matter? Let her escape if she would--let things go as they\r\nmight; nothing was of any further importance--certainly on\r\nearth--perhaps even in heaven.\r\n\r\n"I will go away--I can do you no good--I should only lose my temper; and\r\ntime presses," said Mr. Fordham, with a flush of resentment on his face,\r\nas he turned to the anxious woman behind him. What could he do? He could\r\nnot quarrel with this angry man in his own house on such a day. He could\r\nnot keep happier matters waiting. He would not risk the losing of his\r\ntemper and his time at this moment of all others. He went away with a\r\nsensation of defeat, which for half an hour materially mitigated his\r\nhappiness. But he was happy, and the happy are indulgent judges both of\r\ntheir own conduct and of others. As for the minister, he was roused\r\nagain when he saw his rival jump into the cab at the door, and drive off\r\nalone down the street, which was lively with the early stir of day. The\r\nsun had just broken through the morning clouds, and it was into a ruddy\r\nperspective of light that the stranger disappeared as he went off\r\ntowards Grange Lane. Strange contrast of fate! While Fordham hastened\r\ndown into the sunshine to all the joy that awaited him there, Tozer, a\r\nhomely, matter-of-fact figure in the ruddy light, was crossing the\r\nstreet towards the minister\'s door. Vincent went away from the window\r\nagain, with pangs of an impatience and intolerance of his own lot which\r\nno strength of mind could subdue. All the gleams of impossible joy which\r\nhad lighted his path in Carlingford had now gone out, and left him in\r\ndarkness; and here came back, in undisturbed possession, all the meaner\r\ncircumstances of his individual destiny. Salem alone remained to him out\r\nof the wreck of his dreams; except when he turned back and discovered\r\nher--the one tragic thread in the petty history--this woman whose future\r\nlife for good or for evil he held in his avenging hands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mildmay was still seated by the table. She had regained command of\r\nherself. She looked up to him with gleaming eyes when he approached her.\r\n"Mr. Vincent, I keep my parole-- I am waiting your pleasure," she said,\r\nnever removing her eyes from his face. It was at this moment that Mrs.\r\nVincent, who had from the window of Susan\'s chamber seen the cab arrive\r\nand go away with some curiosity, came into the room. The widow wanted to\r\nknow who her son\'s visitors were, and what had brought them. She came in\r\nwith a little eagerness, but was brought to a sudden standstill by the\r\nappearance of Mrs. Mildmay. Why was this woman here? what had she to do\r\nwith the minister? Mrs. Vincent put on her little air of simple dignity.\r\nShe said, "I beg your pardon; I did not know my son was engaged," with a\r\ncurtsy of disapproving politeness to the unwelcome visitor. With a\r\ntroubled look at Arthur, who looked excited and gloomy enough to\r\njustify any uncomfortable imaginations about him, his mother turned\r\naway somewhat reluctantly. She did not feel that it was quite right to\r\nleave him exposed to the wiles of this "designing woman;" but the\r\nwidow\'s own dignity was partly at stake. All along she had disapproved\r\nof this strange friendship, and she could not countenance it now.\r\n\r\n"Your mother is going away," said Mrs. Mildmay, with a restrained outcry\r\nof despair: "is no one to be permitted to mediate between us? You are a\r\nman and cruel; you are in trouble, and you think you will avenge\r\nyourself. No, no--I don\'t mean what I say. Your son is a--a true knight,\r\nMrs. Vincent; I told you so before. He will never be hard upon a woman:\r\nif I had not known that, why should I have trusted him? I came back, as\r\nhe knows, of my own will. Don\'t go away; I am willing you should\r\nknow--the whole," said the excited woman, with a sudden pause, turning\r\nupon Vincent, her face blanching into deadly whiteness--"the whole--I\r\nconsent; let her be the judge. Women are more cruel than men; but I\r\nsaved her daughter--I am willing that she should hear it all."\r\n\r\nShe sat down again on the seat from which she had risen. A certain\r\ncomfort and relief stole over her face. She was appealing to the general\r\nheart of humanity against this one man who knew her secret. It might be\r\nhard to hear the story of her own sin--but it was harder to be under the\r\nstifling sway of one who knew it, and who had it in his power to\r\ndenounce her. She ceased to tremble as she looked at the widow\'s\r\ntroubled face. It was a new tribunal before which she stood; perhaps\r\nhere her provocations might be acknowledged--her soul acquitted of the\r\nburden from which it could never escape. As the slow moments passed on,\r\nand the minister did not speak, she grew impatient of the silence. "Tell\r\nher," she said, faintly--it was a new hope which thus awoke in her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBut while Mrs. Mildmay sat waiting, and while the widow drew near, not\r\nwithout some judicial state in the poise of her little figure, to hear\r\nthe explanation which she felt she was entitled to, Tozer\'s honest\r\ntroubled face looked in at the door. It put a climax upon the confusion\r\nof the morning. The good butterman looked on in some surprise at this\r\nstrange assemblage, recognising dimly the haze of an excitement of which\r\nhe knew nothing. He was acquainted, to some extent, with the needlewoman\r\nof Back Grove Street. He had gone to call on her once at the\r\nsolicitation of the anxious Brown, who had charge of her district but\r\ndid not feel himself competent to deal with the spiritual necessities of\r\nsuch a penitent; and Tozer remembered well that her state of mind had\r\nnot been satisfactory--"not what was to be looked for in a person as had\r\nthe means of grace close at hand, and attended regular at Salem." He\r\nthought she must have come at this unlucky moment to get assistance of\r\nsome kind from the minister--"as if he had not troubles enough of his\r\nown," Tozer said to himself; but the deacon was not disposed to let his\r\npastor be victimised in any such fashion. This, at least, was a matter\r\nin which he felt fully entitled to interfere.\r\n\r\n"Good mornin\', ma\'am," said the worthy butterman; "good mornin\', Mr.\r\nVincent--it\'s cold, but it\'s seasonable for the time of year. What I\r\nwanted was a word or two with the pastor, ma\'am, if he\'s disengaged. It\r\nain\'t what I approve," continued Tozer, fixing his eyes with some\r\nsternness upon the visitor, "to take up a minister\'s time in the morning\r\nwhen he has the work of a flock on his hands. My business, being such as\r\ncan\'t wait, is different; but them as are in want of assistance, one way\r\nor another, which is a thing as belongs to the deacons, have no excuse,\r\nnot as I can see, for disturbing the pastor. It ain\'t a thing as I would\r\nput up with," continued Tozer, with increasing severity; the charities\r\nof the flock ain\'t in Mr. Vincent\'s hands; it\'s a swindling of his time\r\nto come in upon him of a morning if there ain\'t a good reason; and, as\r\nfar as I am concerned, it would be enough to shut my heart up again\'\r\ngiving help--that\'s how it would work on me."\r\n\r\nMrs. Mildmay was entirely inattentive to the first few words of this\r\naddress, but the pointed application given by the speaker\'s eyes called\r\nher attention presently. She gazed at him, as he proceeded, with a\r\ngradual lightening of her worn and anxious face. While Mrs. Vincent did\r\nall she could, with anxious looks and little deprecatory gestures, to\r\nstop the butterman, the countenance of her visitor cleared by one of\r\nthose strange sudden changes which the minister had noted so often. Her\r\nlips relaxed, her eyes gleamed with a sudden flash of amusement. Then\r\nshe glanced around, seeing with quick observation not only the absurdity\r\nof Tozer\'s mistake, but the infallible effect it had in changing the\r\naspect of affairs. The minister had turned away, not without a grim,\r\nimpatient smile at the corner of his mouth. The minister\'s mother,\r\nshocked in all her gentle politeness, was eagerly watching her\r\nopportunity to break in and set the perplexed deacon right. The culprit,\r\nwho had been on her trial a moment before, drew a long breath of utter\r\nrelief. Now she had escaped--the crisis was over. Her quick spirit rose\r\nwith a sense of triumph--a sensation of amusement. She entered eagerly\r\ninto it, leaning forward with eyes that shone and gleamed upon her\r\naccuser, and a mock solemnity of attention which only her desperate\r\nstrain of mind and faculties could have enabled her to assume so\r\nquickly. When the butterman came to a pause, Mrs. Vincent rushed in\r\nbreathlessly to the rescue.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tozer--Mr. Tozer! this lady is--a--a friend of ours," cried the\r\nminister\'s mother, with looks that were much more eloquent of her\r\ndistress and horror than any words. She had no time to say more, when\r\nthe aggrieved individual herself broke in--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tozer knows I have been one of the flock since ever Mr. Vincent\r\ncame," said the strange woman. "I have gone to all the meetings, and\r\nlistened faithfully to the pastor every time he has preached; and would\r\nyou judge me unworthy of relief because I once came to see him in a\r\nmorning? That is hard laws; but the minister will speak for me. The\r\nminister knows me," she went on, turning to Vincent, "and he and his\r\nmother have been very charitable to a poor woman, Mr. Tozer. You will\r\nnot exclude me from the Salem charities for this one offence? Remember\r\nthat I am a member of the flock."\r\n\r\n"Not a church-member as I know," said the sturdy deacon--"not meaning no\r\noffence, if I\'ve made a mistake--one sitting, as far as I remember; but\r\na--lady--as is a friend of Mrs. Vincent\'s----"\r\n\r\nHere Tozer paused, abashed but suspicious, not disposed to make any\r\nfurther apology. That moment was enough to drive this lighter interlude\r\nfrom the vigilant soul which, in all its moods, watched what was going\r\non with a quick apprehension of the opportunities of the moment. All her\r\nperceptions, quickened as they were by anxiety and fear, were bent on\r\ndiscovering an outlet for her escape, and she saw her chance now. She\r\ngot up wearily, leaning on the table, as indeed she needed to lean, and\r\nlooked into Mrs. Vincent\'s face: "May I see my child?" she said, in a\r\nvoice that went to the heart of the widow. The minister\'s mother could\r\nnot resist this appeal. She saw the trembling in her limbs, the anxiety\r\nin her eye. "Arthur, I will see to Mrs. Mildmay. Mr. Tozer has something\r\nto say to you, and we must not occupy your time," said the tender little\r\nwoman, in whose gentle presence there was protection and shelter even\r\nfor the passionate spirit beside her. Thus the two went away together.\r\nIf there had ever been any revengeful intention in Vincent\'s mind, it\r\nhad disappeared by this time. He too breathed deep with relief. The\r\ncriminal had escaped, at least out of his hands. He was no longer\r\ncompelled to take upon himself the office of an avenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I HOPE, sir, as I haven\'t said anything to give offence?--it was far\r\nfrom my meaning," said Tozer; "not as the--person--is a church-member,\r\nbeing only a seat-holder for one sittin\', as is down in the books. I\r\nwouldn\'t have come over, not so early, Mr. Vincent, if it wasn\'t as I\r\nwas wishful to try if you\'d listen to reason about the meetin\' as is\r\nappointed to be to-night. It ain\'t no interest of mine, not so far as\r\nmoney goes, nor nothing of that kind. It\'s you as I\'m a-thinking of. I\r\ndon\'t mind standing the expense out of my own pocket, if so be as you\'d\r\ngive in to make it a tea-meetin\'. I don\'t know as you\'d need to do\r\nnothing but take the chair and make yourself agreeable. Me and Brown and\r\nthe women would manage the rest. It would be a pleasant surprise, that\'s\r\nwhat it would be," said the good butterman; "and Phoebe and some more\r\nwould go down directly to make ready: and I don\'t doubt as there\'s cakes\r\nand buns enough in Carlingford, Mr. Vincent, sir, if you\'d but bend your\r\nmind to it and consent."\r\n\r\n"I am going out," said Vincent; "I have--something to do; don\'t detain\r\nme, Tozer. I must have this morning to myself."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll walk with you, sir, if I ain\'t in the way," said the deacon,\r\naccompanying the young man\'s restless steps down-stairs. "They tell me\r\nMiss is a deal better, and all things is going on well. I wouldn\'t be\r\nmeddlesome, Mr. Vincent, not of my own will; but when matters is\r\nsettling, sir, if you\'d but hear reason! There can\'t nothing but harm\r\ncome of more explanations. I never had no confidence in explanations,\r\nfor my part; but pleasant looks and the urns a-smoking, and a bit of\r\ngreen on the wall, as Phoebe and the rest could put up in no time! and\r\njust a speech as was agreeable to wind up with--a bit of an anecdote, or\r\npoetry about friends as is better friends after they\'ve spoke their\r\nminds and had it out--that\'s the thing as would settle Salem, Mr.\r\nVincent. I don\'t speak, not to bother you, sir, but for your good. There\r\nain\'t no difficulty in it; it\'s easier a deal than being serious and\r\nopening up all things over again; and as for them as would like to\r\ndictate----"\r\n\r\n"I am not thinking of Salem," said the minister; "I have many other\r\nthings to distract me; for heaven\'s sake, if you have any pity, leave me\r\nalone to-day."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll give in to make it a tea-meetin\'?" said the anxious\r\nbutterman, pausing at his own door.\r\n\r\nTozer did not make out the minister\'s reply. It is difficult to\r\ndistinguish between a nod and a shake of the head, under some\r\ncircumstances--and Vincent did not pause to give an articulate answer,\r\nbut left his champion to his own devices. It seemed to Vincent to be a\r\nlong time since Fordham left his house--and he was possessed with a\r\nfever of impatience to see for himself what was being transacted down\r\nyonder in the sunshine, where the spire of St. Roque\'s appeared in the\r\ndistance through the ruddy morning haze. The bells had ceased, and all\r\nwas quiet enough in Grange Lane. Quite quiet--a few ordinary passengers\r\nin the tranquil road, nursemaids and children--and the calm green doors\r\nclosing in the concealed houses, as if no passion or agitation could\r\npenetrate them. The door of Lady Western\'s garden was ajar. The minister\r\ncrossed over and looked in with a wistful, despairing hope of seeing\r\nsomething that would contradict his conclusion. The house was basking in\r\nthe spring sunshine--the door open, some of the windows open, eager\r\nservants hovering about, an air of expectation over all. With eyes full\r\nof memories, the minister looked in at the half-open door, which one\r\ntime and another had been to him the gate of paradise. Within, where the\r\nred geraniums and verbenas had once brightened all the borders, were\r\npale crocuses and flowers of early spring--the limes were beginning to\r\nbud, the daisies to grow among the grass. The winter was over in that\r\nsheltered and sunny place; Nature herself stood sweet within the\r\nprotecting walls, and gathered all the tenderest sweets of spring to\r\ngreet the bride in the new beginning of her life. It was but a glance,\r\nbut the spectator, in the bitterness of his heart, did not lose a single\r\ntint or line; and just then the joy-bells burst out once more from St.\r\nRoque\'s. Poor Vincent drew back from the door as the sudden sound stung\r\nhim to the heart. Nothing had any pity for him--all the world, and\r\nevery voice and breath therein, sided with the others in their joy. He\r\nwent on blindly, without thinking where he was going, with a kind of\r\ndull, stubborn determination in his heart, not to turn back in his\r\nwretchedness even from the sight of the happy procession which he knew\r\nmust be advancing to meet him. A pang more or less, what did it matter?\r\nAnd for the last time he would look on Her who was nothing in the world\r\nto him now--who never could have been anything--yet who had somehow shed\r\nsuch streams of light upon the poor minister\'s humble path, as no\r\nreality in all his life had ever shed before. He paused on the edge of\r\nthe road as he saw the carriage coming. It was one of those moments when\r\na man\'s entire life becomes apparent to him in long perspective of past\r\nand future, he himself and all the world standing still between. The\r\nbells rang on his heart, with echoes from the wheels and the horses\'\r\nfeet coming up in superb pride and triumph. Heaven and earth were glad\r\nfor her in her joy. He, in his great trouble, stood dark in the sunshine\r\nand looked on.\r\n\r\nIt was only a moment, and no more. He would have seen nothing but the\r\nwhite mist of the veil which surrounded her, had not she in her\r\nloveliness and kindness perceived him, and bent forward in the carriage\r\nwith a little motion of her hand calling the attention of her unseen\r\nbridegroom to that figure on the way. At sight of that movement, the\r\nunhappy young man started with an intolerable pang, and went on heedless\r\nwhere he was going. He could not control the momentary passion. She had\r\nnever harmed him--never meant to dazzle him with her beauty, or trifle\r\nwith his love, or break his heart. It was kind as the sunshine, this\r\nsweet bridal face leaning out with that momentary glance of recognition.\r\nShe would have given him her kind hand, her sweet smile as of old, had\r\nthey met more closely--no remorseful consciousness was in her eyes; but\r\nneither the bells, nor the flowers, nor the sunshine, went with such a\r\npang to poor Vincent\'s heart as did that look of kindness. It was all\r\nunreal then--no foundation at all in it? not enough to call a passing\r\ncolour to her cheek, or to dim her sweet eyes on her bridal day? He went\r\ndown the long road in the insensibility of passion--seeing nothing,\r\ncaring for nothing--stung to the heart. No look of triumph, no female\r\ndart of conscious cruelty, could have given the poor minister so bitter\r\na wound. All her treasured looks and smiles--the touch of her hand--her\r\nwords, of which he had scarcely forgotten one--did they mean nothing\r\nafter all? nothing but kindness? He had laid his heart at her feet; if\r\nshe had trodden on it he could have forgiven her; but she only went on\r\nsmiling, and never saw the treasure in her way. And this was the end.\r\nThe unfortunate young man could not give way to any outbreak of the\r\npassion that consumed him; he could but go on hotly--on past St.\r\nRoque\'s, where flowers still lay in the porch, and the open doors\r\ninvited strangers, to the silent country, where the fields lay callow\r\nunder the touch of spring. Spring! everlasting mockery of human trouble!\r\nHere were the hedgerows stirring, the secret grain beginning to throb\r\nconscious in the old furrows; but life itself standing still--coming to\r\na sudden end in this heart which filled the young man\'s entire frame\r\nwith pulsations of anguish. All his existence had flowed towards this\r\nday, and took its termination here. His love--heaven help him! he had\r\nbut one heart, and had thrown it away; his work--that too was to come to\r\nnothing, and be ended; all his traditions, all his hopes, were they to\r\nbe buried in one grave? and what was to become after of the posthumous\r\nand nameless life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the minister fully came to himself, it was after a long rapid walk\r\nof many miles through the silent fields and hazy country. There the\r\nclouds cleared off from him in the quietness. When he began to see\r\nclearly he turned back towards Carlingford. Nothing now stood between\r\nhim and the crisis which henceforward must determine his personal\r\naffairs. He turned in the long country road, which he had been pursuing\r\neagerly without knowing what he was doing, and gazed back towards the\r\ndistant roofs. His heart ached and throbbed with the pangs that were\r\npast. He had a consciousness that it stirred within his breast, still\r\nsmarting and thrilling with that violent access of agony--but the climax\r\nwas over. The strong pulsations fell into dull beats of indefinite pain.\r\nNow for the other world--the neutral-coloured life. Vincent did not very\r\nwell know which road he had taken, for he had not been thinking of where\r\nhe was going; but it roused him a little to perceive that his homeward\r\nway brought him through Grove Street, and past Siloam Cottage, where Mr.\r\nTufton lived.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tufton was at the window, behind the great geranium, when the\r\nminister came in sight. When she saw him she tapped upon the pane and\r\nbeckoned him to go in. He obeyed the summons, almost without\r\nimpatience, in the languor of his mind. He went in to find them all by\r\nthe fire, just as they had been when he came first to Carlingford. The\r\nold minister, in his arm-chair, holding out his flabby white hand to his\r\ndear young brother; the invalid daughter still knitting, with cold blue\r\neyes, always vigilant and alert, investigating everything. It was a mild\r\nday, and Mrs. Tufton herself had shifted her seat to the window, where\r\nshe had been reading aloud as usual the \'Carlingford Gazette.\' The\r\nmotionless warm air of the little parlour, the prints of the brethren on\r\nthe walls, the attitudes of the living inhabitants, were all unchanged\r\nfrom the time when the young minister of Salem paid his first visit, and\r\nchafed at Mr. Tufton\'s advice, and heard with a secret shiver the\r\nprophecy of Adelaide, that "they would kill him in six months." He took\r\nthe same chair, again making a little commotion among the furniture,\r\nwhich the size of the room made it difficult to displace. It was with a\r\nbewildering sensation that he sat down in that unchangeable house. Had\r\ntime really gone on through all these passions and pains, of which he\r\nwas conscious in his heart? or had it stood still, and were they only\r\ndreams? Adelaide Tufton, immovable in her padded chair, with pale blue\r\neyes that searched through everything, had surely never once altered her\r\nposition, but had knitted away the days with a mystic thread like one of\r\nthe Fates. Even the geranium did not seem to have gained or shed a\r\nsingle leaf.\r\n\r\n"I have just been reading in the \'Gazette\' the report of last night\'s\r\nmeeting," said good Mrs. Tufton. "Oh, Mr. Vincent, I was so glad--your\r\ndear mother herself, if she had been there, could not have been happier\r\nthan I was. I hope she has seen the \'Gazette\' this morning. You young\r\nmen always like the \'Times;\' but they never put in anything that is\r\ninteresting to me in the \'Times.\' Perhaps, if she has not seen it, you\r\nwill put the paper in your pocket. Indeed, it made me as happy as if you\r\nhad been my own son. I always say that is very much how Mr. Tufton and I\r\nfeel for you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it went off very well," said the old minister. "My dear young\r\nbrother, it all depends on whether you have friends that know how to\r\ndeal with a flock; nothing can teach you that but experience. I am sorry\r\nI dare not go out again to-night--it cost me my night\'s rest last night,\r\nas Mrs. Tufton will tell you; but that is nothing in consideration of\r\nduty. Never think of ease to yourself, my dear young friend, when you\r\ncan serve a brother; it has always been my rule through life----"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vincent understands all that," said Adelaide; "that will do,\r\npapa--we know. Tell me about Lady Western\'s marriage, Mr. Vincent. I\r\ndaresay you were invited, as she was such a friend of yours. It must\r\nhave made an awkwardness between you when she turned out to be Colonel\r\nMildmay\'s sister; but, to be sure, those things don\'t matter among\r\npeople in high life. It was delightful that she should marry her old\r\nlove after all, don\'t you think? Poor Sir Joseph would have left a\r\ndifferent will if he had known. Parted for ten years and coming\r\ntogether again! it is like a story in a book----"\r\n\r\n"I do not know the circumstances," said poor Vincent. He turned to Mr.\r\nTufton with a vain hope of escaping. "I shall have to bid you good-bye\r\nshortly," said the minister; "though it was very good of the Salem\r\npeople not to dismiss me, I prefer----"\r\n\r\n"You mean to go away?" said Adelaide; "that will be a wonderful piece of\r\nnews in the connection; but I don\'t think you will go away: there will\r\nbe a deputation, and they will give you a piece of plate, and you will\r\nremain--you will not be able to resist. Papa never was a preacher to\r\nspeak of," continued the dauntless invalid, "but they gave him a purse\r\nand a testimonial when he retired; and you are soft-hearted, and they\r\nwill get the better of you----"\r\n\r\n"Adelaide!" said Mrs. Tufton, "Mr. Vincent will think you out of your\r\nsenses: indeed, Mr. Vincent, she does not mind what she says; and she\r\nhas had so much ill-health, poor child, that both her papa and I have\r\ngiven in to her too much; but as for my husband\'s preaching, it is well\r\nknown he could have had many other charges if his duty had not called\r\nhim to stay at Salem; invitations used to come----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, stuff!" said the irreverent Adelaide--"as if Mr. Vincent did not\r\nknow. But I will tell you about Lady Western--that is the romance of the\r\nday. Mr. Fordham was very poor, you know, when they first saw each\r\nother--only a poor barrister--and the friends interfered. Friends always\r\ninterfere," said the sick woman, fixing her pale eyes on Vincent\'s face\r\nas she went on with her knitting; "and they married her to old Sir\r\nJoseph Western; and so, after a while, she became the young dowager. She\r\nmust have been very pretty then--she is beautiful now; but I would not\r\nhave married a widow, had I been Mr. Fordham, after I came into my\r\nfortune. His elder brother died, you know. I would not have married her,\r\nhowever lovely she had been. Mr. Vincent, would you?"\r\n\r\n"Adelaide!" cried Mrs. Tufton, again in dismay. The poor minister thrust\r\nback his chair from the table, and came roughly against the stand of the\r\ngreat geranium, which had to be adjusted, and covered his retreat. He\r\nglanced at his conscious tormentor with the contemptuous rage and\r\naggravation which men sometimes feel towards a weak creature who insults\r\nthem with impunity. But she did not show any pleasurable consciousness\r\nof her triumph; she kept knitting on, looking at him with her pale blue\r\neyes. There was something in that loveless eagerness of curiosity which\r\nappalled Vincent. He got up hastily to his feet, and said he had\r\nsomething to do and must go away.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, my dear brother," said Mr. Tufton slowly, shaking the young\r\nminister\'s hand; "you will be judicious to-night? The flock have stood\r\nby you, and been indulgent to your inexperience. They see you never\r\nmeant to hurt any of their feelings. It is what I always trained my dear\r\npeople to be--considerate to the young preachers. Take my advice, my\r\nbeloved young brother, and dear Tozer\'s advice. We do all we can for\r\nyou here, and dear Tozer is a tower of strength. And you have our\r\nprayers; we are but a little assembly--I and my dear partner in life and\r\nour afflicted child--but two or three, you know--and we never forget you\r\nat the throne of grace."\r\n\r\nWith this parting blessing Vincent hastened away. Poor little Mrs.\r\nTufton had added some little effusion of motherly kindness which he did\r\nnot listen to. He came away with a strange impression on his mind of\r\nthat knitting woman, pale and curious, in her padded chair. Adelaide\r\nTufton was not old--not a great many years older than himself. To him,\r\nwith the life beating so strong in his veins, the sight of that life in\r\ndeath was strange, almost awful. The despair, the anguish, the vivid\r\nuncertainty and reality of his own existence, appeared to him in\r\nwonderful relief against that motionless background. If he came back\r\nhere ten years hence, he might still find as now the old man by the\r\nfire, the pale woman knitting in her chair, as they had been for these\r\nsix months which had brought to the young minister a greater crowd of\r\nevents than all his previous years. When he thought of that helpless\r\nwoman, with her lively thoughts and curious eyes, always busy and\r\nspeculating about the life from which she was utterly shut out, a\r\nstrange sensation of thankfulness stole over the young man; though he\r\nwas miserable he was alive. Between him and the lovely figure on which\r\nhis heart had dwelt too long, rose up now this other figure which was\r\nnot lovely. He grew stronger as he went home along the streets in the\r\nchanged light of the afternoon. Siloam Cottage interposed between him\r\nand that ineffable moment at the bridal doors; presently Salem too would\r\ninterpose, and all the difficulties and troubles of his career. He had\r\ntaken up life again, after that pause when the sun and the moon stood\r\nstill and the battle raged. Now it was all over, and the world\'s course\r\nhad begun anew.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincent was looking out for him when he reached his own door. He\r\ncould see her disappear from the window above, where she had been\r\nstanding watching. She came to meet him as he went up to the\r\nsitting-room. There was nobody now in that room, where the widow had\r\nbeen making everything smile for her son. The table was spread; the fire\r\nbright; the lamp ready to be lighted on the table. Mrs. Vincent had been\r\nalarmed by Arthur\'s long absence, but she did not say so. She only made\r\nhaste to tell him that Susan was so much better, and that the doctor was\r\nin such high spirits about her. "After we come back from the meeting you\r\nare to go in and sit with your sister for an hour, my dear boy," said\r\nhis mother. "Till that was over, we knew your mind would be occupied,\r\nand Susan would like to see you. Oh, Arthur! it will make you happy only\r\nto look at her. She remembers everything now; she has asked me even all\r\nabout the flock, and cried with joy to hear how things had gone off last\r\nnight--not for joy only," said the truthful widow, "with indignation,\r\ntoo, that you ever should have been doubted--for Susan thinks there is\r\nnobody like her brother; but, my dear, we ought to be very thankful\r\nthat things have happened so well. Everybody must learn to put up with a\r\nlittle injustice in this world, particularly the pastor of a flock. If\r\nyou will go and get ready for dinner, Arthur," said Mrs. Vincent, "I\r\nwill light the lamp. I have taken it into my own hands, dear; it is\r\nbetter to put it right at first than to be always arranging it after it\r\nhas been put wrong. Dinner is quite ready, and make haste, my dear boy.\r\nI have got a little fish for you, and you know it will spoil if you keep\r\nit waiting; and I have so much to tell you before we go out to the\r\nmeeting to-night."\r\n\r\nVincent made no answer to the wistful inquiring look which his mother\r\nturned to his face as she mentioned this meeting. He went away with an\r\nimpatient exclamation about that lamp, which seemed to him to occupy\r\nhalf her thoughts. Mrs. Vincent was full of many cares and much news\r\nwhich she had to give her son; she was also deeply anxious and curious\r\nto know what he was going to do that night; but still she spared a\r\nlittle time for the lamp, to set the screw right, and light to a\r\ndelicate evenness the well-trimmed wick. When she had placed it on the\r\ntable, it gave her a certain satisfaction to see how clearly it burned,\r\nand how bright it made the table. "If I only knew what Arthur was going\r\nto do," she said to herself, with a little sigh, as she rang the bell\r\nfor the dinner, and warned the little maid to be very careful with the\r\nfish; "for if it is not put very nicely on the table Mr. Vincent will\r\nnot have any of it," said the minister\'s mother, with that feminine\r\nmingling of small cares and great which was so incomprehensible to her\r\nson. When he came back and seated himself listlessly at the table, he\r\nnever thought of observing the light, or taking note of the brightness\r\nof the room. To think of this business of dinner at all, interjected\r\ninto such a day, was almost too much for Arthur; and he was half\r\ndisgusted with himself when he found that, after all, he could eat, and\r\nthat not only for his mother\'s sake. Mrs. Vincent talked only of Susan\r\nwhile the little maid was going and coming into the room; but when they\r\nwere alone she drew her chair a little nearer and entered upon other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n"Arthur, I had a great deal of conversation with Mrs. Mildmay; she told\r\nme--everything," said the widow, growing pale. "Oh, my dear! when God\r\nleaves us alone to our own devices, what dreadful things a sinful\r\ncreature may do! I said you would do nothing to harm her now when Susan\r\nwas safe. Hush, dear! we must never breathe a word of it to Susan, or\r\nany one. Susan is changed, Arthur; sometimes I am glad of it, sometimes\r\nI could cry. She is not an innocent girl now. She is a woman--oh,\r\nArthur! a great deal stronger than her mother; she would clear herself\r\nsomehow if she knew; she would not bear that suspicion. She is more like\r\nyour dear papa," said the mother, wiping her eyes, "than I ever thought\r\nto see one of my children. I can see his high-minded ways in her,\r\nArthur--and steadier than you and me; for you have my quick temper,\r\ndear. Wait just another moment, Arthur. This poor child dotes upon\r\nSusan; and her mother asked me," said poor Mrs. Vincent, pausing, and\r\nlooking her son in the face, "if--I would keep her with me."\r\n\r\n"Keep her with you! Let us be rid of them," cried the minister; "they\r\nhave brought us nothing but misery ever since we heard their names."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Arthur dear; but the poor child never did any one any harm. They\r\nhave made her a ward in Chancery now. It should have been done long ago\r\nbut for the wickedness and the disputes; and, my dear boy," said Mrs.\r\nVincent, anxiously, "I will have to leave Lonsdale, you know, my poor\r\nchild could not go back there; and we will not stay with you in\r\nCarlingford to get you into trouble with your flock," continued the\r\nwidow, gazing wistfully in his face to see if she could gather anything\r\nof his purpose from his looks; "and with my little income, you know, it\r\nwould be hard work without coming on you; but all the difficulty is\r\ncleared away if we take this child. I was thinking I might take Susan\r\nabroad," said the widow, with a little sigh; "it is the best thing, I\r\nhave always heard, after such trouble; and it would be an occupation for\r\nher when she got better. My dear boy, don\'t be hasty; your dear father\r\nalways took a little time to think upon a thing before he would speak;\r\nbut you have always had my temper, Arthur. I won\'t say any more; we will\r\nspeak of it, dear, in your sister\'s room, when we come home from the\r\nmeeting to-night."\r\n\r\n"I think you had better not go to the meeting to-night; there will be\r\nnothing said to please you, mother," said the minister, rising from the\r\ntable, and taking his favourite position on the hearthrug. His mother\r\nturned round frightened, but afraid to show her fright, determined still\r\nto look as if she believed everything was going well.\r\n\r\n"No fine speeches, Arthur? My dear boy, I always like to hear you speak.\r\nI know you will say what you ought," said the widow, smiling, with a\r\npatient determination in her face. Then there was a pause. "Perhaps you\r\nwill give me a little sketch of what you are going to say," she went on,\r\nwith a tender artifice, concealing her anxiety. "Your dear papa often\r\ndid, Arthur, when anything was going on among the flock."\r\n\r\nBut Arthur made no reply. His clouded face filled his mother with a host\r\nof indefinite fears. But she saw, as she had seen so often, that\r\nwomanish entreaties were not practicable, and that he must be left to\r\nhimself. "He will tell me as we go to Salem," she said in her heart, to\r\nquiet its anxious throbbing. "Perhaps you would like to have the room to\r\nyourself a little, dear," she said aloud. "I will go to Susan till it is\r\ntime to leave; and I know my Arthur will ask the counsel of God," she\r\nadded softly, just touching his hand with a tender momentary clasp. It\r\nwas all the minister could do to resist the look of anxious inquiry with\r\nwhich this little caress was accompanied; and then she left him to\r\nprepare for his meeting. Whether he asked advice or not of his Father in\r\nheaven, the widow asked it for him with tears in her anxious eyes. She\r\nhad done all that she could do. When the minister was left to himself,\r\nhe opened his desk and took out the manuscript with which he had been\r\nbusy last night. It was the speech he had intended to deliver, and he\r\nhad been pleased with it. He sat down now and read it over to himself,\r\nby the white-covered table, on which his mother\'s lamp burned bright.\r\nSheet by sheet, as he read it over, the impatient young man tossed into\r\nthe fire, with hasty exclamations of disgust. He was excited; his mind\r\nwas in fiery action; his heart moved to the depths. No turgid Homerton\r\neloquence would do now. What he said must be not from the lips, but from\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VINCENT was ready in very good time for the meeting; she brought\r\nher son a cup of coffee with her own hand when she was dressed in her\r\nbonnet and shawl. She had put on her best bonnet--her newest black silk\r\ndress. Perhaps she knew that device of Tozer\'s, of which the minister\r\nyet was not aware; but Arthur for once was too peremptory and decided\r\nfor his mother. She who knew how to yield when resistance was\r\nimpossible, had to give in to him at last. It was better to stay at\r\nhome, anxious as her heart was, than to exasperate her boy, who had so\r\nmany other things to trouble him. With much heroism the widow took off\r\nher bonnet again and returned to Susan\'s room. There could be little\r\ndoubt now what the minister was going to do. While she seated herself\r\nonce more by her daughter\'s bedside, in a patience which was all but\r\nunbearable, her son went alone to his last meeting with his flock. He\r\nwalked rapidly through Grove Street, going through the stream of Salem\r\npeople, who were moving in twos and threes in the same direction. A\r\nlittle excitement had sprung up in Carlingford on the occasion. The\r\npublic in general had begun to find out, as the public generally does,\r\nthat here was a man who was apt to make disclosures not only of his\r\nopinions but of himself wherever he appeared, and that a chance was\r\nhereby afforded to the common eye of seeing that curious phenomenon, a\r\nhuman spirit in action--a human heart as it throbbed and changed--a\r\nsight more interesting than any other dramatic performance under heaven.\r\nThere was an unusual throng that night in Grove Street, and the audience\r\nwas not less amazed than the minister when they found what awaited them\r\nin the Salem schoolroom. There Phoebe Tozer and her sister-spirits had\r\nbeen busy all day. Again there were evergreen wreaths on the walls, and\r\nthe stiff iron gaslights were bristling with holly. Phoebe\'s genius\r\nhad even gone further than on the last great occasion, for there were\r\npink and white roses among the green leaves, and one of the texts which\r\nhung on the wall had been temporarily elevated over the platform, framed\r\nin wreaths and supported by extempore fastenings, the doubtful security\r\nof which filled Phoebe\'s artless soul with many a pang of terror. It\r\nwas the tender injunction, "Love one another," which had been elevated\r\nto this post of honour, and this was the first thing which met Vincent\'s\r\neye as he entered the room. Underneath, the platform table was already\r\nfilled with the elite of the flock. The ladies were all in their best\r\nbonnets in that favoured circle, and Tozer stood glorious in his Sunday\r\nattire--but in his own mind privately a little anxious as to the effect\r\nof all this upon the sensitive mind of the minister--by the side of the\r\nempty chair which had been left for the president of the assembly. When\r\nVincent was seen to enter, it was Tozer who gave the signal for a burst\r\nof cheering, which the pleased assembly, newly aware of the treat thus\r\nprovided for it, performed heartily with all its boots and umbrellas.\r\nThrough this applause the minister made his way to the platform with\r\nabstracted looks. The cheer made no difference upon the stubborn\r\ndispleasure and annoyance of his face. Nothing that could possibly have\r\nbeen done to aggravate his impatient spirit and make his resolve\r\nunalterable, could have been more entirely successful than poor Tozer\'s\r\nexpedient for the conciliation of the flock. Angry, displeased, humbled\r\nin his own estimation, the unfortunate pastor made his way through the\r\npeople, who were all smiles and conscious favour. A curt general bow and\r\ncold courtesy was all he had even for his friends on the platform, who\r\nbeamed upon him as he advanced. He was not mollified by the universal\r\napplause; he was not to be moved to complaisance by any such argument.\r\nHe would not take the chair, though Tozer, with anxious officiousness,\r\nput it ready for him, and Phoebe looked up with looks of entreaty from\r\nbehind the urn. In the sight of all the people he refused the honour,\r\nand sat down on a little supernumerary seat behind, where he was not\r\nvisible to the increasing crowd. This refusal sent a thrill through all\r\nthe anxious deacons on the platform. They gathered round him to make\r\nremonstrances, to which the minister paid no regard. It was a dreadful\r\nmoment. Nobody knew what to do in the emergency. The throng streamed in\r\ntill there was no longer an inch of standing-ground, nor a single seat\r\nvacant, except that one empty chair which perplexed the assembly. The\r\nurns began to smoke less hotly; the crowd gave murmurous indications of\r\nimpatience as the deacons cogitated-- What was to be done?--the tea at\r\nleast must not be permitted to get cold. At last Mr. Brown stood up and\r\nproposed feebly, that as Mr. Vincent did not wish to preside, Mr. Tozer\r\nshould be chairman on this joyful occasion. The Salem folks, who thought\r\nit a pity to neglect the good things before them, assented with some\r\nperplexity, and then the business of the evening began.\r\n\r\nIt was very lively business for the first half-hour. Poor Mrs. Tufton,\r\nwho was seated immediately in front of the minister, disturbed by his\r\nimpatient movements, took fright for the young man; and could not but\r\nwonder in herself how people managed to eat cake and drink tea in such\r\nan impromptu fashion, who doubtless had partaken of that meal before\r\nleaving home, as she justly reflected. The old minister\'s wife stood by\r\nthe young minister with a natural esprit the corps, and was more anxious\r\nthan she could account for. A certain cloud subdued the hilarity of the\r\ntable altogether; everybody was aware of the dark visage of the\r\nminister, indignant and annoyed, behind. A certain hush was upon the\r\ntalk, and Tozer himself had grown pale in the chair, where the good\r\nbutterman by no means enjoyed his dignity. Tozer was not so eloquent as\r\nusual when he got up to speak. He told the refreshed and exhilarated\r\nflock that he had made bold to give them a little treat, out of his own\r\nhead, seeing that everything had gone off satisfactory last night; and\r\nthey would agree with him as the minister had no call to take no further\r\ntrouble in the way of explanations. A storm of applause was the response\r\nof the Salem folks to this suggestion; they were in the highest\r\ngood-humour both with themselves and the minister--ready to vote him a\r\nsilver tea-service on the spot, if anybody had been prompt enough to\r\nsuggest it. But a certain awe stole over even that delighted assembly\r\nwhen Mr. Vincent came forward to the front of the table and confronted\r\nthem all, turning his back upon his loyal supporters. They did not know\r\nwhat to make of the dark aspect and clouded face of the pastor, relieved\r\nas it was against the alarmed and anxious countenances behind him. A\r\npanic seized upon Salem: something which they had not anticipated--something\r\nvery different from the programme--was in the minister\'s eye.\r\n\r\nThe Pigeons were in a back seat--very far back, where Mrs. Vincent had\r\nbeen the previous evening--spies to see what was going on, plotting the\r\nTemperance Hall and an opposition preacher in their treacherous hearts;\r\nbut even Mrs. Pigeon bent forward with excitement in the general\r\nflutter. When the minister said "My friends," you could have heard a pin\r\ndrop in the crowded meeting; and when, a minute after, a leaf of holly\r\ndetached itself and fluttered down from one of the gaslights, the whole\r\nrow of people among whom it fell thrilled as if they had received a\r\nblow. Hush! perhaps it is not going to be so bad after all. He is\r\ntalking of the text there over the platform, in its evergreen frame,\r\nwhich Phoebe trembles to think may come down any moment with a crash\r\nupon her father\'s anxious head. "Love one another!" Is Mr. Vincent\r\ntelling them that he is not sure what that means, though he is a\r\nminister--that he is not very sure what anything means--that life is a\r\ngreat wonder, and that he only faintly guesses how God, being pitiful,\r\nhad the heart to make man and leave him on this sad earth? Is that what\r\nhe says as he stands pale before the silent assembly, which scarcely\r\ndares draw breath, and is ashamed of its own lightness of heart and\r\nvulgar satisfaction with things in general? That is what the minister\r\nsays. "The way is full of such pitfalls--the clouds so heavy\r\noverhead--the heavens, so calm and indifferent, out of reach--cannot we\r\ntake hands and help each other through this troubled journey?" says the\r\norator, with a low voice and solemn eyes. When he pauses thus and looks\r\nthem all in the face, the heart of Salem fails. The very gaslights seem\r\nto darken in the air, in the silence, and there is not one of the\r\nmanagers who does not hear the beating of his own heart. Then suddenly\r\nthe speaker raises his voice, raises his hand, storms over their heads\r\nin a burst of indignation not loud but grand. He says "No."--"No!"\r\nexclaims the minister--"not in the world, not in the church, nowhere on\r\nearth can we be unanimous except by moments. We throw our brother down,\r\nand then extend a hand to him in charity--but we have lost the art of\r\nstanding side by side. Love! it means that you secure a certain woman to\r\nyourself to make your hearth bright, and to be yours for ever; it means\r\nthat you have children who are yours, to perpetuate your name and your\r\ntastes and feelings. It does not mean that you stand by your brother for\r\nhim and not for you!"\r\n\r\nThen there followed another pause. The Salem people drew a long breath\r\nand looked in each other\'s faces. They were guilty, self-convicted; but\r\nthey could not tell what was to come of it, nor guess what the speaker\r\nmeant. The anxious faces behind, gazing at him and his audience, were\r\nblank and horror-stricken, like so many conspirators whose leader was\r\nbetraying their cause. They could not tell what accusation he might be\r\ngoing to make against them, to be confirmed by their consciences; but\r\nnobody except Tozer had the least conception what he was about to say.\r\n\r\nThe minister resumed his interrupted speech. Nobody had ventured to\r\ncheer him; but during this last pause, seeing that he himself waited,\r\nand by way of cheering up their own troubled hearts, a few feeble and\r\ntimid plaudits rose from the further end of the room. Mr. Vincent\r\nhurriedly resumed to stop this, with characteristic impatience. "Wait\r\nbefore you applaud me," said the Nonconformist. "I have said nothing\r\nthat calls for applause. I have something more to tell you--more novel\r\nthan what I have been saying. I am going to leave Carlingford. It was\r\nyou who elected me, it is you who have censured me, it was you last\r\nnight who consented to look over my faults and give me a new trial. I am\r\none of those who have boasted in my day that I received my title to\r\nordination from no bishop, from no temporal provision, from no\r\ntraditionary church, but from the hands of the people. Perhaps I am\r\nless sure than I was at first, when you were all disposed to praise me,\r\nthat the voice of the people is the voice of God; but, however that may\r\nbe, what I received from you I can but render up to you. I resign into\r\nyour hands your pulpit, which you have erected with your money, and hold\r\nas your property. I cannot hold it as your vassal. If there is any truth\r\nin the old phrase which calls a church a cure of souls, it is certain\r\nthat no cure of souls can be delegated to a preacher by the souls\r\nthemselves who are to be his care. I find my old theories inadequate to\r\nthe position in which I find myself, and all I can do is to give up the\r\npost where they have left me in the lurch. I am either your servant,\r\nresponsible to you, or God\'s servant, responsible to Him--which is it? I\r\ncannot tell; but no man can serve two masters, as you know. Many of you\r\nhave been kind to me--chief among all," said Vincent, turning once round\r\nto look in Tozer\'s anxious face, "my friend here, who has spared no\r\npains either to make me such a pastor as you wished, or to content me\r\nwith that place when he had secured it. I cannot be content. It is no\r\nlonger possible. So there remains nothing but to say\r\ngood-bye--good-bye!--farewell! I will see you again to say it more\r\nformally. I only wish you to understand now that this is the decision I\r\nhave come to, and that I consider myself no longer the minister of Salem\r\nfrom this night."\r\n\r\nVincent drew back instantly when he had said these words, but not before\r\nhalf the people on the platform had got up on their feet, and many had\r\nrisen in the body of the room. The women stretched out their hands to\r\nhim with gestures of remonstrance and entreaty. "He don\'t mean it; he\'s\r\nnot going for to leave us; he\'s in a little pet, that\'s all," cried Mrs.\r\nBrown, loud out. Phoebe Tozer, forgetting all about the text and the\r\nevergreens, had buried her face in her handkerchief and was weeping, not\r\nwithout demonstration of the fact. Tozer himself grasped at the\r\nminister\'s shoulder, and called out to the astonished assembly that\r\n"they weren\'t to take no notice. Mr. Vincent would hear reason. They\r\nweren\'t a-going to let him go, not like this." The minister had almost\r\nto struggle through the group of remonstrant deacons. "You don\'t mean\r\nit, Mr. Vincent?" said Mrs. Tozer; "only say as it\'s a bit o\' temper,\r\nand you don\'t mean it!" Phoebe, on her part, raised a tear-wet cheek\r\nto listen to the pastor\'s reply; but the pastor only shook his head, and\r\nmade no answer to the eager appeals which assailed him. When he had\r\nextricated himself from their hands and outcries, he hastened down the\r\ntumultuous and narrow passage between the benches, where he would not\r\nhear anything that was addressed to him, but passed through with a brief\r\nnod to his anxious friends. Just as Vincent reached the door, he\r\nperceived, with eyes which excitement had made clearer than usual, that\r\nhis enemy, Pigeon, had just got to his feet, who shouted out that the\r\npastor had spoken up handsome, and that there wasn\'t one in Salem,\r\nwhatever was their inclination, as did not respect him that day. Though\r\nhe paid no visible attention to the words, perhaps the submission of\r\nhis adversary gave a certain satisfaction to the minister\'s soul; but he\r\ntook no notice of this nor anything else, as he hurried out into the\r\nsilent street, where the lamps were lighted, and the stars shining\r\nunobserved overhead. Not less dark than the night were the prospects\r\nwhich lay before him. He did not know what he was to do--could not see a\r\nday before him of his new career; but, nevertheless, took his way out of\r\nSalem with a sense of freedom, and a thrill of new power and vigour in\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nBehind he left a most tumultuous and disorderly meeting. After the first\r\noutburst of dismay and sudden popular desire to retain the impossible\r\npossession which had thus slid out of their hands--after Tozer\'s\r\ndistressed entreaty that they would all wait and see if Mr. Vincent\r\ndidn\'t hear reason--after Pigeon\'s reluctant withdrawal of enmity and\r\nburst of admiration, the meeting broke up into knots, and became not one\r\nmeeting, but a succession of groups, all buzzing in different tones over\r\nthe great event. Resolutions, however, were proposed and carried all the\r\nsame. Another deputation was appointed to wait on Mr. Vincent. A\r\nproposal was made to raise his "salary," and a subscription instituted\r\non the spot to present him with a testimonial. When all these things\r\nwere concluded, nothing remained but to dismiss the assembly, which\r\ndispersed not without hopes of a satisfactory conclusion. The deacons\r\nremained for a final consultation, perplexed with alarms and doubts. The\r\nrepentant Pigeon, restored to them by this emergency, was the most\r\nhopeful of all. Circumstances which had changed his mind must surely\r\ninfluence the pastor. An additional fifty pounds of "salary"--a piece of\r\nplate--a congregational ovation--was it to be supposed that any\r\nDissenting minister bred at Homerton could withstand such conciliatory\r\novertures as these?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT the deputation and the increased salary and the silver salver were\r\nall ineffectual. Arthur would not hear reason, as his mother knew. It\r\nwas with bitter restrained tears of disappointment and vexation that she\r\nheard from him, when he returned to that conference in Susan\'s room, the\r\nevents of the evening. It came hard upon the widow, who had invited her\r\nson to his sister\'s bedside that they might for the first time talk\r\ntogether as of old over all their plans. But though her heart ached over\r\nthe opportunity thus thrown away, and though she asked herself with\r\nterror, "What was Arthur to do now?" his mother knew he was not to be\r\npersuaded. She smiled on Tozer next morning, ready to cry with vexation\r\nand anxiety as she was. "When my son has made up his mind, it will be\r\nvain for any one to try to move him," said the widow, proud of him in\r\nspite of all, though her heart cried out against his imprudence and\r\nfoolishness; and so it proved. The minister made his acknowledgments so\r\nheartily to the good butterman, that Tozer\'s disclaimer of any special\r\nmerit, and declaration that he had but tried to "do his dooty," was made\r\nwith great faltering and unsteadiness; but the Nonconformist himself\r\nnever wavered in his resolve. Half of Carlingford sat in tears to hear\r\nMr. Vincent\'s last sermon. Such a discourse had never been heard in\r\nSalem. Scarcely one of the deacons could find a place in the crowded\r\nchapel to which all the world rushed; and Tozer himself listened to the\r\nlast address of his minister from one of the doors of the gallery, where\r\nhis face formed the apex and culminating point of the crowd to Mr.\r\nVincent\'s eyes. When Tozer brushed his red handkerchief across his face,\r\nas he was moved to do two or three times in the course of the sermon,\r\nthe gleam seemed to the minister, who was himself somewhat excited, to\r\nredden over the entire throng. It was thus that Mr. Vincent ended his\r\nconnection with Salem Chapel. It was a heavy blow to the congregation\r\nfor the time--so heavy that the spirit of the butterman yielded; he was\r\nnot seen in his familiar seat for three full Sundays after; but the\r\nplace was mismanaged in Pigeon\'s hands, and regard for the connection\r\nbrought Tozer to the rescue. They had Mr. Beecher down from Homerton,\r\nwho made a very good impression. The subsequent events are so well known\r\nin Carlingford, that it is hardly necessary to mention the marriage of\r\nthe new minister, which took place about six months afterwards. Old Mr.\r\nTufton blessed the union of his dear young brother with the blushing\r\nPhoebe, who made a most suitable minister\'s wife in Salem after the\r\nfirst disagreeables were over; and Mr. Beecher proved a great deal more\r\ntractable than any man of genius. If he was not quite equal to Mr.\r\nVincent in the pulpit, he was much more complaisant at all the\r\ntea-parties; and, after a year\'s experience, was fully acknowledged,\r\nboth by himself and others, to have made an \'it.\r\n\r\nVincent meanwhile plunged into that world of life which the young man\r\ndid not know; not that matters looked badly for him when he left\r\nCarlingford--on the contrary, the connection in general thrilled to hear\r\nof his conduct and his speech. The enthusiasm in Homerton was too great\r\nto be kept within bounds. Such a demonstration of the rightful claims of\r\nthe preacher had not been made before in the memory of man; and the\r\nenlightened Nonconforming community did honour to the martyr. Three\r\nvacant congregations at least wooed him to their pulpits; his fame\r\nspread over the country: but he did not accept any of these invitations;\r\nand after a while the eminent Dissenting families who invited him to\r\ndinner, found so many other independencies cropping out in the young\r\nman, that the light of their countenances dimmed upon him. It began to\r\nbe popularly reported, that a man so apt to hold opinions of his own,\r\nand so convinced of the dignity of his office, had best have been in the\r\nChurch where people knew no better. Such, perhaps, might have been the\r\nconclusion to which he came himself; but education and prejudice and\r\nHomerton stood invincible in the way. A Church of the Future--an ideal\r\ncorporation, grand and primitive, not yet realised, but surely real, to\r\nbe come at one day--shone before his eyes, as it shines before so many;\r\nbut, in the mean time, the Nonconformist went into literature, as was\r\nnatural, and was, it is believed in Carlingford, the founder of the\r\n\'Philosophical Review,\' that new organ of public opinion. He had his\r\nbattle to fight, and fought it out in silence, saying little to any one.\r\nSundry old arrows were in his heart, still quivering by times as he\r\nfought with the devil and the world in his desert; but he thought\r\nhimself almost prosperous, and perfectly composed and eased of all\r\nfanciful and sentimental sorrows, when he went, two or three years after\r\nthese events, to Folkestone, to meet his mother and sister, who had been\r\nliving abroad, away from him, with their charge, and to bring them to\r\nthe little house he had prepared for them in London, and where he said\r\nto himself he was prepared, along with them--a contented but\r\nneutral-coloured household--to live out his life.\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Vincent met his mother at Folkestone, not even the haze of\r\nthe spring evening, nor the agitation of the meeting, which brought back\r\nagain so forcibly all the events which accompanied the parting, could\r\nsoften to him the wonderful thrill of surprise, almost a shock, with\r\nwhich he looked upon two of the party. The widow, in her close white cap\r\nand black bonnet, was unchanged as when she fell, worn out, into his\r\narms on her first visit to Carlingford. She gave a little cry of joy as\r\nshe saw her son. She trembled so with emotion and happiness, that he\r\nhad to steady her on his arm and restrain his own feelings till another\r\ntime. The other two walked by their side to the hotel where they were to\r\nrest all night. He had kissed Susan in the faint evening light, but her\r\nbrother did not know that grand figure, large and calm and noble like a\r\nRoman woman, at whom the other passengers paused to look as they went\r\non; and his first glance at the younger face by her side sent the blood\r\nback to his heart with a sudden pang and thrill which filled him with\r\namazement at himself. He heard the two talking to each other, as they\r\nwent up the crowded pier in the twilight, like a man walking in a dream.\r\nWhat his mother said, leaning on his arm, scarcely caught his attention.\r\nHe answered to her in monosyllables, and listened to the voices--the\r\nlow, sweet laughter, the sound of the familiar names. Nothing in Susan\'s\r\ngirlish looks had prophesied that majestic figure, that air of quiet\r\ncommand and power. And a wilder wonder still attracted the young man\'s\r\nheart as he listened to the beautiful young voice which kept calling on\r\nSusan, Susan, like some sweet echo of a song. These two, had they been\r\ninto another world, an enchanted country? When they came into the\r\nlighted room, and he saw them divest themselves of their wrappings, and\r\nbeheld them before him, visible tangible creatures and no dreams,\r\nVincent was struck dumb. He seemed to himself to have been suddenly\r\ncarried out of the meaner struggles of his own life into the air of a\r\ncourt, the society of princes. When Susan came up to him and laid her\r\ntwo beautiful hands on his shoulders, and looked with her blue eyes into\r\nhis face, it was all he could do to preserve his composure, and conceal\r\nthe almost awe which possessed him. The wide sleeve had fallen back from\r\nher round beautiful arm. It was the same arm that used to lie stretched\r\nout uncovered upon her sick-bed like a glorious piece of marble. Her\r\nbrother could scarcely rejoice in the change, it struck him with so much\r\nwonder, and was so different from his thoughts. Poor Susan! he had said\r\nin his heart for many a day. He could not say poor Susan now.\r\n\r\n"Arthur does not know me," she said, with a low, liquid voice, fuller\r\nthan the common tones of women. "He forgets how long it is ago since we\r\nwent away. He thinks you cannot have anything so big belonging to you,\r\nmy little mother. But it is me, Arthur. Susan all the same."\r\n\r\n"Susan perhaps, since you say so--but not all the same," said Arthur,\r\nwith his astonished eyes.\r\n\r\n"And I daresay you don\'t know Alice either," said his sister. "I was\r\nlittle and Alice was foolish when we went away. At least I was little in\r\nLonsdale, where nobody minded me. Somehow most people mind me now,\r\nbecause I am so big, I suppose; and Alice, instead of being foolish, is\r\na little wise woman. Come here, Alice, and let my brother see you. You\r\nhave heard of him every day for three years. At last here is Arthur;\r\nbut what am I to do if he has forgotten me?"\r\n\r\n"I have forgotten neither of you," said the young man. He was glad to\r\nescape from Susan\'s eyes, which somehow looked as if they were a bit of\r\nthe sky, a deep serene of blue; and the little Alice imagined he did not\r\nlook at her at all, and was a little mortified in her tender heart.\r\nThings began to grow familiar to him after a while. However wonderful\r\nthey were, they were real creatures, who did not vanish away, but were\r\nclose by him all the evening, moving about--this with lovely fairy\r\nlightness, that with majestic maiden grace--talking in a kind of dual,\r\nharmonious movement of sound, filling the soft spring night with a world\r\nof vague and strange fascination. The window was opened in their\r\nsitting-room, where they could see the lights and moving figures, and,\r\nfarther off, the sea--and hear outside the English voices, which were\r\nsweet to hear to the strangers newly come home. Vincent, while he\r\nrecovered himself, stood near this window by his mother\'s chair, paying\r\nher such stray filial attentions as he could in the bewilderment of his\r\nsoul, and slowly becoming used to the two beautiful young women,\r\nunexpected apparitions, who transformed life itself and everything in\r\nit. Was one his real sister, strange as it seemed? and the other----?\r\nVincent fell back and resigned himself to the strange, sweet,\r\nunlooked-for influence. They went up to London together next day.\r\nSunshine did not disperse them into beautiful mists, as he had almost\r\nfeared. It came upon him by glimpses to see that fiery sorrow and\r\npassion had acted like some tropical tempestuous sun upon his sister\'s\r\nyouth; and the face of his love looked back upon him from the storm in\r\nwhich it died, as if somehow what was impossible might be possible\r\nagain. Mrs. Mildmay, a wandering restless soul as she was, happened to\r\nbe absent from London just then. Alice was still to stay with her\r\ndearest friends. The Nonconformist went back to his little home with the\r\nsensation of an enchanted prince in a fairy tale. Instead of the\r\nmud-coloured existence, what a glowing, brilliant firmament! Life became\r\nglorious again under their touch. As for Mrs. Vincent, she was too happy\r\nin getting home--in seeing Susan, after all the anguishes and struggles\r\nwhich no one knew of fully but herself, rising up in all the strength of\r\nher youth to this renewed existence--to feel as much distressed as she\r\nhad expected about Arthur\'s temporary withdrawal from his profession. It\r\nwas only a temporary withdrawal, she hoped. He still wore his clerical\r\ncoat, and called himself "clergyman" in the Blue Book--and he was doing\r\nwell, though he was not preaching. The Nonconformist himself naturally\r\nwas less sober in his thoughts. He could not tell what wonderful thing\r\nhe might not yet do in this wonderful elevation and new inspiring of his\r\nheart. His genius broke forth out of the clouds. Seeing these two as\r\nthey went about the house, hearing their voices as they talked in\r\nperpetual sweet accord, with sweeter jars of difference, surprised the\r\nyoung man\'s life out of all its shadows;--one of them his sister--the\r\nother----. After all his troubles, the loves and the hopes came back\r\nwith the swallows to build under his eaves and stir in his heart.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nPRINTING OFFICE OF THE PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTypographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:\r\n\r\nI hope the congregration will=> I hope the congregation will {pg 180}\r\n\r\nshoked in all her gentle politeness=> shocked in all her gentle\r\npoliteness {pg 278}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Salem Chapel, v. 2/2, by Mrs. Oliphant\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SALEM CHAPEL, V. 2/2 ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 42044-8.txt or 42044-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/2/0/4/42044/\r\n\r\nProduced by Chuck Greif and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was\r\nproduced from images available at The Internet Archive)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
