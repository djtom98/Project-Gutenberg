FREDERICK DOUGLASS\'S LETTER\r\n\r\nDEAR MISS WELLS:\r\n\r\nLet me give you thanks for your faithful paper on the lynch abomination\r\nnow generally practiced against colored people in the South. There has\r\nbeen no word equal to it in convincing power. I have spoken, but my word\r\nis feeble in comparison. You give us what you know and testify from actual\r\nknowledge. You have dealt with the facts with cool, painstaking fidelity,\r\nand left those naked and uncontradicted facts to speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nBrave woman! you have done your people and mine a service which can\r\nneither be weighed nor measured. If the American conscience were only half\r\nalive, if the American church and clergy were only half Christianized, if\r\nAmerican moral sensibility were not hardened by persistent infliction of\r\noutrage and crime against colored people, a scream of horror, shame, and\r\nindignation would rise to Heaven wherever your pamphlet shall be read.\r\n\r\nBut alas! even crime has power to reproduce itself and create conditions\r\nfavorable to its own existence. It sometimes seems we are deserted by\r\nearth and Heaven--yet we must still think, speak and work, and trust in\r\nthe power of a merciful God for final deliverance.\r\n\r\nVery truly and gratefully yours,\r\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS\r\nCedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1\r\nThe Case Stated      57\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\nLynch-Law Statistics      65\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\nLynching Imbeciles      73\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\nLynching of Innocent Men      84\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\nLynched for Anything or Nothing      93\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\nHistory of Some Cases of Rape      108\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\nThe Crusade Justified      121\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\nMiss Willard\'s Attitude      129\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\nLynching Record for 1894      139\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\nThe Remedy      147\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE CASE STATED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student of American sociology will find the year 1894 marked by a\r\npronounced awakening of the public conscience to a system of anarchy and\r\noutlawry which had grown during a series of ten years to be so common,\r\nthat scenes of unusual brutality failed to have any visible effect upon\r\nthe humane sentiments of the people of our land.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the emancipation of the Negro, the inevitable result of\r\nunbribled power exercised for two and a half centuries, by the white man\r\nover the Negro, began to show itself in acts of conscienceless outlawry.\r\nDuring the slave regime, the Southern white man owned the Negro body and\r\nsoul. It was to his interest to dwarf the soul and preserve the body.\r\nVested with unlimited power over his slave, to subject him to any and all\r\nkinds of physical punishment, the white man was still restrained from such\r\npunishment as tended to injure the slave by abating his physical powers\r\nand thereby reducing his financial worth. While slaves were scourged\r\nmercilessly, and in countless cases inhumanly treated in other respects,\r\nstill the white owner rarely permitted his anger to go so far as to take a\r\nlife, which would entail upon him a loss of several hundred dollars. The\r\nslave was rarely killed, he was too valuable; it was easier and quite as\r\neffective, for discipline or revenge, to sell him "Down South."\r\n\r\nBut Emancipation came and the vested interests of the white man in the\r\nNegro\'s body were lost. The white man had no right to scourge the\r\nemancipated Negro, still less has he a right to kill him. But the Southern\r\nwhite people had been educated so long in that school of practice, in\r\nwhich might makes right, that they disdained to draw strict lines of\r\naction in dealing with the Negro. In slave times the Negro was kept\r\nsubservient and submissive by the frequency and severity of the scourging,\r\nbut, with freedom, a new system of intimidation came into vogue; the Negro\r\nwas not only whipped and scourged; he was killed.\r\n\r\nNot all nor nearly all of the murders done by white men, during the past\r\nthirty years in the South, have come to light, but the statistics as\r\ngathered and preserved by white men, and which have not been questioned,\r\nshow that during these years more than ten thousand Negroes have been\r\nkilled in cold blood, without the formality of judicial trial and legal\r\nexecution. And yet, as evidence of the absolute impunity with which the\r\nwhite man dares to kill a Negro, the same record shows that during all\r\nthese years, and for all these murders only three white men have been\r\ntried, convicted, and executed. As no white man has been lynched for the\r\nmurder of colored people, these three executions are the only instances of\r\nthe death penalty being visited upon white men for murdering Negroes.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough the commission of these crimes began to tell upon the\r\npublic conscience, and the Southern white man, as a tribute to the\r\nnineteenth-century civilization, was in a manner compelled to give excuses\r\nfor his barbarism. His excuses have adapted themselves to the emergency,\r\nand are aptly outlined by that greatest of all Negroes, Frederick\r\nDouglass, in an article of recent date, in which he shows that there have\r\nbeen three distinct eras of Southern barbarism, to account for which three\r\ndistinct excuses have been made.\r\n\r\nThe first excuse given to the civilized world for the murder of\r\nunoffending Negroes was the necessity of the white man to repress and\r\nstamp out alleged "race riots." For years immediately succeeding the war\r\nthere was an appalling slaughter of colored people, and the wires usually\r\nconveyed to northern people and the world the intelligence, first, that an\r\ninsurrection was being planned by Negroes, which, a few hours later, would\r\nprove to have been vigorously resisted by white men, and controlled with a\r\nresulting loss of several killed and wounded. It was always a remarkable\r\nfeature in these insurrections and riots that only Negroes were killed\r\nduring the rioting, and that all the white men escaped unharmed.\r\n\r\nFrom 1865 to 1872, hundreds of colored men and women were mercilessly\r\nmurdered and the almost invariable reason assigned was that they met their\r\ndeath by being alleged participants in an insurrection or riot. But this\r\nstory at last wore itself out. No insurrection ever materialized; no\r\nNegro rioter was ever apprehended and proven guilty, and no dynamite ever\r\nrecorded the black man\'s protest against oppression and wrong. It was too\r\nmuch to ask thoughtful people to believe this transparent story, and the\r\nsouthern white people at last made up their minds that some other excuse\r\nmust be had.\r\n\r\nThen came the second excuse, which had its birth during the turbulent\r\ntimes of reconstruction. By an amendment to the Constitution the Negro was\r\ngiven the right of franchise, and, theoretically at least, his ballot\r\nbecame his invaluable emblem of citizenship. In a government "of the\r\npeople, for the people, and by the people," the Negro\'s vote became an\r\nimportant factor in all matters of state and national politics. But this\r\ndid not last long. The southern white man would not consider that the\r\nNegro had any right which a white man was bound to respect, and the idea\r\nof a republican form of government in the southern states grew into\r\ngeneral contempt. It was maintained that "This is a white man\'s\r\ngovernment," and regardless of numbers the white man should rule. "No\r\nNegro domination" became the new legend on the sanguinary banner of the\r\nsunny South, and under it rode the Ku Klux Klan, the Regulators, and the\r\nlawless mobs, which for any cause chose to murder one man or a dozen as\r\nsuited their purpose best. It was a long, gory campaign; the blood chills\r\nand the heart almost loses faith in Christianity when one thinks of Yazoo,\r\nHamburg, Edgefield, Copiah, and the countless massacres of defenseless\r\nNegroes, whose only crime was the attempt to exercise their right to vote.\r\n\r\nBut it was a bootless strife for colored people. The government which had\r\nmade the Negro a citizen found itself unable to protect him. It gave him\r\nthe right to vote, but denied him the protection which should have\r\nmaintained that right. Scourged from his home; hunted through the swamps;\r\nhung by midnight raiders, and openly murdered in the light of day, the\r\nNegro clung to his right of franchise with a heroism which would have\r\nwrung admiration from the hearts of savages. He believed that in that\r\nsmall white ballot there was a subtle something which stood for manhood as\r\nwell as citizenship, and thousands of brave black men went to their\r\ngraves, exemplifying the one by dying for the other.\r\n\r\nThe white man\'s victory soon became complete by fraud, violence,\r\nintimidation and murder. The franchise vouchsafed to the Negro grew to be\r\na "barren ideality," and regardless of numbers, the colored people found\r\nthemselves voiceless in the councils of those whose duty it was to rule.\r\nWith no longer the fear of "Negro Domination" before their eyes, the\r\nwhite man\'s second excuse became valueless. With the Southern governments\r\nall subverted and the Negro actually eliminated from all participation in\r\nstate and national elections, there could be no longer an excuse for\r\nkilling Negroes to prevent "Negro Domination."\r\n\r\nBrutality still continued; Negroes were whipped, scourged, exiled, shot\r\nand hung whenever and wherever it pleased the white man so to treat them,\r\nand as the civilized world with increasing persistency held the white\r\npeople of the South to account for its outlawry, the murderers invented\r\nthe third excuse--that Negroes had to be killed to avenge their assaults\r\nupon women. There could be framed no possible excuse more harmful to the\r\nNegro and more unanswerable if true in its sufficiency for the white man.\r\n\r\nHumanity abhors the assailant of womanhood, and this charge upon the Negro\r\nat once placed him beyond the pale of human sympathy. With such unanimity,\r\nearnestness and apparent candor was this charge made and reiterated that\r\nthe world has accepted the story that the Negro is a monster which the\r\nSouthern white man has painted him. And today, the Christian world feels,\r\nthat while lynching is a crime, and lawlessness and anarchy the certain\r\nprecursors of a nation\'s fall, it can not by word or deed, extend sympathy\r\nor help to a race of outlaws, who might mistake their plea for justice and\r\ndeem it an excuse for their continued wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe Negro has suffered much and is willing to suffer more. He recognizes\r\nthat the wrongs of two centuries can not be righted in a day, and he tries\r\nto bear his burden with patience for today and be hopeful for tomorrow.\r\nBut there comes a time when the veriest worm will turn, and the Negro\r\nfeels today that after all the work he has done, all the sacrifices he has\r\nmade, and all the suffering he has endured, if he did not, now, defend his\r\nname and manhood from this vile accusation, he would be unworthy even of\r\nthe contempt of mankind. It is to this charge he now feels he must make\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nIf the Southern people in defense of their lawlessness, would tell the\r\ntruth and admit that colored men and women are lynched for almost any\r\noffense, from murder to a misdemeanor, there would not now be the\r\nnecessity for this defense. But when they intentionally, maliciously and\r\nconstantly belie the record and bolster up these falsehoods by the words\r\nof legislators, preachers, governors and bishops, then the Negro must give\r\nto the world his side of the awful story.\r\n\r\nA word as to the charge itself. In considering the third reason assigned\r\nby the Southern white people for the butchery of blacks, the question must\r\nbe asked, what the white man means when he charges the black man with\r\nrape. Does he mean the crime which the statutes of the civilized states\r\ndescribe as such? Not by any means. With the Southern white man, any\r\nmesalliance existing between a white woman and a colored man is a\r\nsufficient foundation for the charge of rape. The Southern white man says\r\nthat it is impossible for a voluntary alliance to exist between a white\r\nwoman and a colored man, and therefore, the fact of an alliance is a proof\r\nof force. In numerous instances where colored men have have been lynched\r\non the charge of rape, it was positively known at the time of lynching,\r\nand indisputably proven after the victim\'s death, that the relationship\r\nsustained between the man and woman was voluntary and clandestine, and\r\nthat in no court of law could even the charge of assault have been\r\nsuccessfully maintained.\r\n\r\nIt was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race,\r\nthat the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her\r\nreturn to her home forbidden under penalty of death, for writing the\r\nfollowing editorial which was printed in her paper, the _Free Speech,_ in\r\nMemphis, Tenn., May 21,1892:\r\n\r\n  Eight Negroes lynched since last issue of the _Free Speech_ one at\r\n  Little Rock, Ark., last Saturday morning where the citizens broke(?)\r\n  into the penitentiary and got their man; three near Anniston, Ala., one\r\n  near New Orleans; and three at Clarksville, Ga., the last three for\r\n  killing a white man, and five on the same old racket--the new alarm\r\n  about raping white women. The same programme of hanging, then shooting\r\n  bullets into the lifeless bodies was carried out to the letter. Nobody\r\n  in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that\r\n  Negro men rape white women. If Southern white men are not careful, they\r\n  will overreach themselves and public sentiment will have a reaction; a\r\n  conclusion will then be reached which will be very damaging to the moral\r\n  reputation of their women.\r\n\r\nBut threats cannot suppress the truth, and while the Negro suffers the\r\nsoul deformity, resultant from two and a half centuries of slavery, he is\r\nno more guilty of this vilest of all vile charges than the white man who\r\nwould blacken his name.\r\n\r\nDuring all the years of slavery, no such charge was ever made, not even\r\nduring the dark days of the rebellion, when the white man, following the\r\nfortunes of war went to do battle for the maintenance of slavery. While\r\nthe master was away fighting to forge the fetters upon the slave, he left\r\nhis wife and children with no protectors save the Negroes themselves. And\r\nyet during those years of trust and peril, no Negro proved recreant to his\r\ntrust and no white man returned to a home that had been dispoiled.\r\n\r\nLikewise during the period of alleged "insurrection," and alarming "race\r\nriots," it never occurred to the white man, that his wife and children\r\nwere in danger of assault. Nor in the Reconstruction era, when the hue and\r\ncry was against "Negro Domination," was there ever a thought that the\r\ndomination would ever contaminate a fireside or strike to death the virtue\r\nof womanhood. It must appear strange indeed, to every thoughtful and\r\ncandid man, that more than a quarter of a century elapsed before the Negro\r\nbegan to show signs of such infamous degeneration.\r\n\r\nIn his remarkable apology for lynching, Bishop Haygood, of Georgia, says:\r\n"No race, not the most savage, tolerates the rape of woman, but it may be\r\nsaid without reflection upon any other people that the Southern people are\r\nnow and always have been most sensitive concerning the honor of their\r\nwomen--their mothers, wives, sisters and daughters." It is not the purpose\r\nof this defense to say one word against the white women of the South. Such\r\nneed not be said, but it is their misfortune that the chivalrous white men\r\nof that section, in order to escape the deserved execration of the\r\ncivilized world, should shield themselves by their cowardly and infamously\r\nfalse excuse, and call into question that very honor about which their\r\ndistinguished priestly apologist claims they are most sensitive. To\r\njustify their own barbarism they assume a chivalry which they do not\r\npossess. True chivalry respects all womanhood, and no one who reads the\r\nrecord, as it is written in the faces of the million mulattoes in the\r\nSouth, will for a minute conceive that the southern white man had a very\r\nchivalrous regard for the honor due the women of his own race or respect\r\nfor the womanhood which circumstances placed in his power. That chivalry\r\nwhich is "most sensitive concerning the honor of women" can hope for but\r\nlittle respect from the civilized world, when it confines itself entirely\r\nto the women who happen to be white. Virtue knows no color line, and the\r\nchivalry which depends upon complexion of skin and texture of hair can\r\ncommand no honest respect.\r\n\r\nWhen emancipation came to the Negroes, there arose in the northern part of\r\nthe United States an almost divine sentiment among the noblest, purest\r\nand best white women of the North, who felt called to a mission to educate\r\nand Christianize the millions of southern exslaves. From every nook and\r\ncorner of the North, brave young white women answered that call and left\r\ntheir cultured homes, their happy associations and their lives of ease,\r\nand with heroic determination went to the South to carry light and truth\r\nto the benighted blacks. It was a heroism no less than that which calls\r\nfor volunteers for India, Africa and the Isles of the sea. To educate\r\ntheir unfortunate charges; to teach them the Christian virtues and to\r\ninspire in them the moral sentiments manifest in their own lives, these\r\nyoung women braved dangers whose record reads more like fiction than fact.\r\nThey became social outlaws in the South. The peculiar sensitiveness of the\r\nsouthern white men for women, never shed its protecting influence about\r\nthem. No friendly word from their own race cheered them in their work; no\r\nhospitable doors gave them the companionship like that from which they had\r\ncome. No chivalrous white man doffed his hat in honor or respect. They\r\nwere "Nigger teachers"--unpardonable offenders in the social ethics of the\r\nSouth, and were insulted, persecuted and ostracised, not by Negroes, but\r\nby the white manhood which boasts of its chivalry toward women.\r\n\r\nAnd yet these northern women worked on, year after year, unselfishly, with\r\na heroism which amounted almost to martyrdom. Threading their way through\r\ndense forests, working in schoolhouse, in the cabin and in the church,\r\nthrown at all times and in all places among the unfortunate and lowly\r\nNegroes, whom they had come to find and to serve, these northern women,\r\nthousands and thousands of them, have spent more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury in giving to the colored people their splendid lessons for home\r\nand heart and soul. Without protection, save that which innocence gives to\r\nevery good woman, they went about their work, fearing no assault and\r\nsuffering none. Their chivalrous protectors were hundreds of miles away in\r\ntheir northern homes, and yet they never feared any "great dark-faced\r\nmobs," they dared night or day to "go beyond their own roof trees." They\r\nnever complained of assaults, and no mob was ever called into existence to\r\navenge crimes against them. Before the world adjudges the Negro a moral\r\nmonster, a vicious assailant of womanhood and a menace to the sacred\r\nprecincts of home, the colored people ask the consideration of the silent\r\nrecord of gratitude, respect, protection and devotion of the millions of\r\nthe race in the South, to the thousands of northern white women who have\r\nserved as teachers and missionaries since the war.\r\n\r\nThe Negro may not have known what chivalry was, but he knew enough to\r\npreserve inviolate the womanhood of the South which was entrusted to his\r\nhands during the war. The finer sensibilities of his soul may have been\r\ncrushed out by years of slavery, but his heart was full of gratitude to\r\nthe white women of the North, who blessed his home and inspired his soul\r\nin all these years of freedom. Faithful to his trust in both of these\r\ninstances, he should now have the impartial ear of the civilized world,\r\nwhen he dares to speak for himself as against the infamy wherewith he\r\nstands charged.\r\n\r\nIt is his regret, that, in his own defense, he must disclose to the world\r\nthat degree of dehumanizing brutality which fixes upon America the blot of\r\na national crime. Whatever faults and failings other nations may have in\r\ntheir dealings with their own subjects or with other people, no other\r\ncivilized nation stands condemned before the world with a series of crimes\r\nso peculiarly national. It becomes a painful duty of the Negro to\r\nreproduce a record which shows that a large portion of the American people\r\navow anarchy, condone murder and defy the contempt of civilization. These\r\npages are written in no spirit of vindictiveness, for all who give the\r\nsubject consideration must concede that far too serious is the condition\r\nof that civilized government in which the spirit of unrestrained outlawry\r\nconstantly increases in violence, and casts its blight over a continually\r\ngrowing area of territory. We plead not for the colored people alone, but\r\nfor all victims of the terrible injustice which puts men and women to\r\ndeath without form of law. During the year 1894, there were 132 persons\r\nexecuted in the United States by due form of law, while in the same year,\r\n197 persons were put to death by mobs who gave the victims no opportunity\r\nto make a lawful defense. No comment need be made upon a condition of\r\npublic sentiment responsible for such alarming results.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the pages which follow shall be to give the record which\r\nhas been made, not by colored men, but that which is the result of\r\ncompilations made by white men, of reports sent over the civilized world\r\nby white men in the South. Out of their own mouths shall the murderers be\r\ncondemned. For a number of years the _Chicago Tribune_, admittedly one of\r\nthe leading journals of America, has made a specialty of the compilation\r\nof statistics touching upon lynching. The data compiled by that journal\r\nand published to the world January 1, 1894, up to the present time has not\r\nbeen disputed. In order to be safe from the charge of exaggeration, the\r\nincidents hereinafter reported have been confined to those vouched for by\r\nthe Tribune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nLYNCH-LAW STATISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the record published in the _Chicago Tribune_, January 1, 1894, the\r\nfollowing computation of lynching statistics is made referring only to the\r\ncolored victims of Lynch Law during the year 1893:\r\n\r\nARSON\r\n\r\nSept. 15, Paul Hill, Carrollton, Ala.; Sept. 15, Paul Archer, Carrollton,\r\nAla.; Sept. 15, William Archer, Carrollton, Ala.; Sept. 15, Emma Fair,\r\nCarrollton, Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSPECTED ROBBERY\r\n\r\nDec. 23, unknown negro, Fannin, Miss.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSAULT\r\n\r\nDec. 25, Calvin Thomas, near Brainbridge, Ga.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTEMPTED ASSAULT\r\n\r\nDec. 28, Tillman Green, Columbia, La.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENDIARISM\r\n\r\nJan. 26, Patrick Wells, Quincy, Fla.; Feb. 9, Frank Harrell, Dickery,\r\nMiss.; Feb. 9, William Filder, Dickery, Miss.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTEMPTED RAPE\r\n\r\nFeb. 21, Richard Mays, Springville, Mo.; Aug. 14, Dug Hazleton,\r\nCarrollton, Ga.; Sept. 1, Judge McNeil, Cadiz, Ky.; Sept. 11, Frank Smith,\r\nNewton, Miss.; Sept. 16, William Jackson, Nevada, Mo.; Sept. 19, Riley\r\nGulley, Pine Apple, Ala.; Oct. 9, John Davis, Shorterville, Ala.; Nov. 8,\r\nRobert Kennedy, Spartansburg, S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURGLARY\r\n\r\nFeb. 16, Richard Forman, Granada, Miss.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIFE BEATING\r\n\r\nOct. 14, David Jackson, Covington, La.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTEMPTED MURDER\r\n\r\nSept. 21, Thomas Smith, Roanoke, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTEMPTED ROBBERY\r\n\r\nDec. 12, four unknown negroes, near Selma, Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\nRACE PREJUDICE\r\n\r\nJan. 30, Thomas Carr, Kosciusko, Miss.; Feb. 7, William Butler, Hickory\r\nCreek, Texas; Aug. 27, Charles Tart, Lyons Station, Miss.; Dec. 7, Robert\r\nGreenwood, Cross county, Ark.; July 14, Allen Butler, Lawrenceville, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIEVES\r\n\r\nOct. 24, two unknown negroes, Knox Point, La.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLEGED BARN BURNING\r\n\r\nNov. 4, Edward Wagner, Lynchburg, Va.; Nov. 4, William Wagner, Lynchburg,\r\nVa.; Nov. 4, Samuel Motlow, Lynchburg, Va.; Nov. 4, Eliza Motlow,\r\nLynchburg, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLEGED MURDER\r\n\r\nJan. 21, Robert Landry, St. James Parish, La.; Jan. 21, Chicken George,\r\nSt. James Parish, La.; Jan. 21, Richard Davis, St. James Parish, La.; Dec.\r\n8, Benjamin Menter, Berlin, Ala.; Dec. 8, Robert Wilkins, Berlin, Ala.;\r\nDec. 8, Joseph Gevhens, Berlin, Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLEGED COMPLICITY IN MURDER\r\n\r\nSept. 16, Valsin Julian, Jefferson Parish, La.; Sept. 16, Basil Julian,\r\nJefferson Parish, La.; Sept. 16, Paul Julian, Jefferson Parish, La.; Sept.\r\n16, John Willis, Jefferson Parish, La.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURDER\r\n\r\nJune 29, Samuel Thorp, Savannah, Ga.; June 29, George S.

The facts contended for will always appear\r\nmanifest--that not one-third of the victims lynched were charged with\r\nrape, and further that the charges made embraced a range of offenses from\r\nmurders to misdemeanors.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 there were 241 persons lynched. The entire number is divided among\r\nthe following states:\r\n\r\nAlabama, 22; Arkansas, 25; California, 3; Florida, 11; Georgia, 17; Idaho,\r\n8; Illinois, 1; Kansas, 3; Kentucky, 9; Louisiana, 29; Maryland, 1;\r\nMississippi, 16; Missouri, 6; Montana, 4; New York, 1; North Carolina, 5;\r\nNorth Dakota, 1; Ohio, 3; South Carolina, 5; Tennessee, 28; Texas, 15;\r\nVirginia, 7; West Virginia, 5; Wyoming, 9; Arizona Territory, 3; Oklahoma,\r\n2.\r\n\r\nOf this number 160 were of Negro descent. Four of them were lynched in New\r\nYork, Ohio and Kansas; the remainder were murdered in the South. Five of\r\nthis number were females. The charges for which they were lynched cover a\r\nwide range. They are as follows:\r\n\r\nRape, 46; murder, 58; rioting, 3; race prejudice, 6; no cause given, 4;\r\nincendiarism, 6; robbery, 6; assault and battery, 1; attempted rape, 11;\r\nsuspected robbery, 4; larceny, 1; self-defense, 1; insulting women, 2;\r\ndesperadoes, 6; fraud, 1; attempted murder, 2; no offense stated, boy and\r\ngirl, 2.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the boy and girl above referred to, their father, named\r\nHastings, was accused of the murder of a white man; his fourteen-year-old\r\ndaughter and sixteen-year-old son were hanged and their bodies filled with\r\nbullets, then the father was also lynched. This was in November, 1892, at\r\nJonesville, Louisiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nLYNCHING IMBECILES\r\n\r\n_(An Arkansas Butchery)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only excuse which capital punishment attempts to find is upon the\r\ntheory that the criminal is past the power of reformation and his life is\r\na constant menace to the community. If, however, he is mentally\r\nunbalanced, irresponsible for his acts, there can be no more inhuman act\r\nconceived of than the wilful sacrifice of his life. So thoroughly is that\r\nprinciple grounded in the law, that all civilized society surrounds human\r\nlife with a safeguard, which prevents the execution of a criminal who is\r\ninsane, even if sane at the time of his criminal act. Should he become\r\ninsane after its commission the law steps in and protects him during the\r\nperiod of his insanity. But Lynch Law has no such regard for human life.\r\nAssuming for itself an absolute supremacy over the law of the land, it has\r\ntime and again dyed its hands in the blood of men who were imbeciles. Two\r\nor three noteworthy cases will suffice to show with what inhuman ferocity\r\nirresponsible men have been put to death by this system of injustice.\r\n\r\nAn instance occurred during the year 1892 in Arkansas, a report of which\r\nis given in full in the _Arkansas Democrat_, published at Little Rock, in\r\nthat state, on the eleventh day of February of that year. The paper\r\nmentioned is perhaps one of the leading weeklies in that state and the\r\naccount given in detail has every mark of a careful and conscientious\r\ninvestigation. The victims of this tragedy were a colored man, named Hamp\r\nBiscoe, his wife and a thirteen-year-old son. Hamp Biscoe, it appears, was\r\na hard working, thrifty farmer, who lived near England, Arkansas, upon a\r\nsmall farm with his family. The investigation of the tragedy was\r\nconducted by a resident of Arkansas named R.B. Caries, a white man, who\r\nfurnished the account to the _Arkansas Democrat_ over his own signature.\r\nHe says the original trouble which led to the lynching was a quarrel\r\nbetween Biscoe and a white man about a debt. About six years after Biscoe\r\npreempted his land, a white man made a demand of $100 upon him for\r\nservices in showing him the land and making the sale. Biscoe denied the\r\nservice and refused to pay the demand. The white man, however, brought\r\nsuit, obtained judgment for the hundred dollars and Biscoe\'s farm was sold\r\nto pay the judgment.\r\n\r\nThe suit, judgment and subsequent legal proceedings appear to have driven\r\nBiscoe almost crazy and brooding over his wrongs he grew to be a confirmed\r\nimbecile. He would allow but few men, white or colored, to come upon his\r\nplace, as he suspected every stranger to be planning to steal his farm. A\r\nweek preceding the tragedy, a white man named Venable, whose farm adjoined\r\nBiscoe\'s, let down the fence and proceeded to drive through Biscoe\'s\r\nfield. The latter saw him; grew very excited, cursed him and drove him\r\nfrom his farm with bitter oaths and violent threats. Venable went away and\r\nsecured a warrant for Biscoe\'s arrest. This warrant was placed in the\r\nhands of a constable named John Ford, who took a colored deputy and two\r\nwhite men out to Biscoe\'s farm to make the arrest. When they arrived at\r\nthe house Biscoe refused to be arrested and warned them he would shoot if\r\nthey persisted in their attempt to arrest him. The warning was unheeded by\r\nFord, who entered upon the premises, when Biscoe, true to his word, fired\r\nupon him. The load tore a part of his clothes from his body, one shot\r\ngoing through his arm and entering his breast. After he had fallen, Ford\r\ndrew his revolver and shot Biscoe in the head and his wife through the\r\narm. The Negro deputy then began firing and struck Biscoe in the small of\r\nthe back. Ford\'s wound was not dangerous and in a few days he was able to\r\nbe around again. Biscoe, however, was so severely shot that he was unable\r\nto stand after the firing was over.\r\n\r\nTwo other white men hearing the exchange of shots went to the rescue of\r\nthe officers, forced open the door of Biscoe\'s cabin and arrested him, his\r\nwife and thirteen-year-old son, and took them, together with a babe at the\r\nbreast, to a small frame house near the depot and put them under guard.\r\nThe subsequent proceedings were briefly told by Mr. Carlee in the columns\r\nof the _Arkansas Democrat_ above mentioned, from whose account the\r\nfollowing excerpt is taken:\r\n\r\n  It was rumored here that the Negroes were to be lynched that night, but\r\n  I do not think it was generally credited, as it was not believed that\r\n  Ford was greatly hurt and the Negro was held to be fatally injured and\r\n  crazy at that. But that night, about 8 o\'clock, a party of perhaps\r\n  twelve or fifteen men, a number of whom were known to the guards, came\r\n  to the house and told the Negro guards they would take care of the\r\n  prisoners now, and for them to leave; as they did not obey at once they\r\n  were persuaded to leave with words that did not admit of delay.\r\n\r\n  The woman began to cry and said, "You intend to kill us to get our\r\n  money." They told her to hush (she was heavy with child and had a child\r\n  at her breast) as they intended to give her a nice present. The guards\r\n  heard no more, but hastened to a Negro church near by and urged the\r\n  preacher to go up and stop the mob. A few minutes after, the shooting\r\n  began, perhaps about forty shots being fired. The white men then left\r\n  rapidly and the Negroes went to the house. Hamp Biscoe and his wife were\r\n  killed, the baby had a slight wound across the upper lip; the boy was\r\n  still alive and lived until after midnight, talking rationally and\r\n  telling who did the shooting.\r\n\r\n  He said when they came in and shot his father, he attempted to run out\r\n  of doors and a young man shot him in the bowels and that he fell. He saw\r\n  another man shoot his mother and a taller young man, whom he did not\r\n  know, shoot his father. After they had killed them, the young man who\r\n  had shot his mother pulled off her stockings and took $220 in currency\r\n  that she had hid there. The men then came to the door where the boy was\r\n  lying and one of them turned him over and put his pistol to his breast\r\n  and shot him again. This is the story the dying boy told as near as I\r\n  can get it. It is quite singular that the guards and those who had\r\n  conversed with him were not required to testify. The woman was known to\r\n  have the money as she had exposed it that day. She also had $36 in\r\n  silver, which the plunderer of the body did not get. The Negro was\r\n  undoubtedly insane and had been for several years. The citizens of this\r\n  community condemn the murder and have no sympathy with it. The Negro was\r\n  a well-to-do farmer, but had become crazed because he was convinced some\r\n  plot had been made to steal his land and only a few days ago declared\r\n  that he expected to die in defense of his home in a short time and he\r\n  did not care how soon. The killing of a woman with the child at her\r\n  breast and in her condition, and also a young boy, was extremely brutal.\r\n  As for Hamp Biscoe he was dangerous and should long have been confined\r\n  in the insane asylum. Such were the facts as near as I can get them and\r\n  you can use them as you see fit, but I would prefer you would suppress\r\n  the names charged by the Negroes with the killing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the civilized world will think, that with all these facts laid\r\nbefore the public, by a writer who signs his name to his communication, in\r\na land where grand juries are sworn to investigate, where judges and\r\njuries are sworn to administer the law and sheriffs are paid to execute\r\nthe decrees of the courts, and where, in fact, every instrument of\r\ncivilization is supposed to work for the common good of all citizens, that\r\nthis matter was duly investigated, the criminals apprehended and the\r\npunishment meted out to the murderers. But this is a mistake; nothing of\r\nthe kind was done or attempted. Six months after the publication, above\r\nreferred to, an investigator, writing to find out what had been done in\r\nthe matter, received the following reply:\r\n\r\n  OFFICE OF\r\n  S.S. GLOVER,\r\n  SHERIFF AND COLLECTOR,\r\n  LONOKE COUNTY.\r\n\r\n  Lonoke, Ark., 9-12-1892\r\n\r\n  Geo. Washington, Esq.,\r\n  Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR:--The parties who killed Hamp Briscoe February the ninth, have\r\n  never been arrested. The parties are still in the county. It was done by\r\n  some of the citizens, and those who know will not tell.\r\n\r\n  S.S. GLOVER, Sheriff\r\n\r\nThus acts the mob with the victim of its fury, conscious that it will\r\nnever be called to an account. Not only is this true, but the moral\r\nsupport of those who are chosen by the people to execute the law, is\r\nfrequently given to the support of lawlessness and mob violence. The press\r\nand even the pulpit, in the main either by silence or open apology, have\r\ncondoned and encouraged this state of anarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORTURED AND BURNED IN TEXAS\r\n\r\nNever In the history of civilization has any Christian people stooped to\r\nsuch shocking brutality and indescribable barbarism as that which\r\ncharacterized the people of Paris, Texas, and adjacent communities on the\r\nfirst of February, 1893. The cause of this awful outbreak of human passion\r\nwas the murder of a four-year-old child, daughter of a man named Vance.\r\nThis man, Vance, had been a police officer in Paris for years, and was\r\nknown to be a man of bad temper, overbearing manner and given to harshly\r\ntreating the prisoners under his care. He had arrested Smith and, it is\r\nsaid, cruelly mistreated him. Whether or not the murder of his child was\r\nan art of fiendish revenge, it has not been shown, but many persons who\r\nknow of the incident have suggested that the secret of the attack on the\r\nchild lay in a desire for revenge against its father.\r\n\r\nIn the same town there lived a Negro, named Henry Smith, a well-known\r\ncharacter, a kind of roustabout, who was generally considered a harmless,\r\nweak-minded fellow, not capable of doing any important work, but\r\nsufficiently able to do chores and odd jobs around the houses of the white\r\npeople who cared to employ him. A few days before the final tragedy, this\r\nman, Smith, was accused of murdering Myrtle Vance. The crime of murder was\r\nof itself bad enough, and to prove that against Smith would have been\r\namply sufficient in Texas to have committed him to the gallows, but the\r\nfinding of the child so exasperated the father and his friends, that they\r\nat once shamefully exaggerated the facts and declared that the babe had\r\nbeen ruthlessly assaulted and then killed. The truth was bad enough, but\r\nthe white people of the community made it a point to exaggerate every\r\ndetail of the awful affair, and to inflame the public mind so that nothing\r\nless than immediate and violent death would satisfy the populace. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the child was not brutally assaulted as the world has been\r\ntold in excuse for the awful barbarism of that day. Persons who saw the\r\nchild after its death, have stated, under the most solemn pledge to truth,\r\nthat there was no evidence of such an assault as was published at that\r\ntime, only a slight abrasion and discoloration was noticeable and that\r\nmostly about the neck. In spite of this fact, so eminent a man as Bishop\r\nHaygood deliberately and, it must also appear, maliciously falsified the\r\nfact by stating that the child was torn limb from limb, or to quote his\r\nown words, "First outraged with demoniacal cruelty and then taken by her\r\nheels and torn asunder in the mad wantonness of gorilla ferocity."\r\n\r\nNothing is farther from the truth than that statement. It is a\r\ncoldblooded, deliberate, brutal falsehood which this Christian(?) Bishop\r\nuses to bolster up the infamous plea that the people of Paris were driven\r\nto insanity by learning that the little child had been viciously\r\nassaulted, choked to death, and then torn to pieces by a demon in human\r\nform. It was a brutal murder, but no more brutal than hundreds of murders\r\nwhich occur in this country, and which have been equalled every year in\r\nfiendishness and brutality, and for which the death penalty is prescribed\r\nby law and inflicted only after the person has been legally adjudged\r\nguilty of the crime. Those who knew Smith, believe that Vance had at some\r\ntime given him cause to seek revenge and that this fearful crime was the\r\noutgrowth of his attempt to avenge himself of some real or fancied wrong.\r\nThat the murderer was known as an imbecile, had no effect whatever upon\r\nthe people who thirsted for his blood. They determined to make an example\r\nof him and proceeded to carry out their purpose with unspeakably greater\r\nferocity than that which characterized the half-crazy object of their\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nFor a day or so after the child was found in the woods, Smith remained in\r\nthe vicinity as if nothing had happened, and when finally becoming aware\r\nthat he was suspected, he made an attempt to escape. He was apprehended,\r\nhowever, not far from the scene of his crime and the news flashed across\r\nthe country that the white Christian people of Paris, Texas and the\r\ncommunities thereabout had deliberately determined to lay aside all forms\r\nof law and inaugurate an entirely new form of punishment for the murder.\r\nThey absolutely refused to make any inquiry as to the sanity or insanity\r\nof their prisoner, but set the day and hour when in the presence of\r\nassembled thousands they put their helpless victim to the stake, tortured\r\nhim, and then burned him to death for the delectation and satisfaction of\r\nChristian people.\r\n\r\nLest it might be charged that any description of the deeds of that day are\r\nexaggerated, a white man\'s description which was published in the white\r\njournals of this country is used. The _New York Sun_ of February 2, 1893,\r\ncontains an account, from which we make the following excerpt:\r\n\r\n  PARIS, Tex., Feb. 1, 1893.--Henry Smith, the negro ravisher of\r\n  four-year-old Myrtle Vance, has expiated in part his awful crime by\r\n  death at the stake. Ever since the perpetration of his awful crime this\r\n  city and the entire surrounding country has been in a wild frenzy of\r\n  excitement. When the news came last night that he had been captured at\r\n  Hope, Ark., that he had been identified by B.B. Sturgeon, James T.\r\n  Hicks, and many other of the Paris searching party, the city was wild\r\n  with joy over the apprehension of the brute. Hundreds of people poured\r\n  into the city from the adjoining country and the word passed from lip\r\n  to lip that the punishment of the fiend should fit the crime that death\r\n  by fire was the penalty Smith should pay for the most atrocious murder\r\n  and terrible outrage in Texas history. Curious and sympathizing alike,\r\n  they came on train and wagons, on horse, and on foot to see if the frail\r\n  mind of a man could think of a way to sufficiently punish the\r\n  perpetrator of so terrible a crime. Whisky shops were closed, unruly\r\n  mobs were dispersed, schools were dismissed by a proclamation from the\r\n  mayor, and everything was done in a business-like manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETING OF CITIZENS\r\n\r\nAbout 2 o\'clock Friday a mass meeting was called at the courthouse and\r\ncaptains appointed to search for the child. She was found mangled beyond\r\nrecognition, covered with leaves and brush as above mentioned. As soon as\r\nit was learned upon the recovery of the body that the crime was so\r\natrocious the whole town turned out in the chase. The railroads put up\r\nbulletins offering free transportation to all who would join in the\r\nsearch. Posses went in every direction, and not a stone was left unturned.\r\nSmith was tracked to Detroit on foot, where he jumped on a freight train\r\nand left for his old home in Hempstead county, Arkansas. To this county he\r\nwas tracked and yesterday captured at Clow, a flag station on the Arkansas\r\n& Louisiana railway about twenty miles north of Hope. Upon being\r\nquestioned the fiend denied everything, but upon being stripped for\r\nexamination his undergarments were seen to be spattered with blood and a\r\npart of his shirt was torn off. He was kept under heavy guard at Hope last\r\nnight, and later on confessed the crime.\r\n\r\nThis morning he was brought through Texarkana, where 5,000 people awaited\r\nthe train, anxious to see a man who had received the fate of Ed. Coy. At\r\nthat place speeches were made by prominent Paris citizens, who asked that\r\nthe prisoner be not molested by Texarkana people, but that the guard be\r\nallowed to deliver him up to the outraged and indignant citizens of Paris.\r\nAlong the road the train gathered strength from the various towns, the\r\npeople crowded upon the platforms and tops of coaches anxious to see the\r\nlynching and the negro who was soon to be delivered to an infuriated mob.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNED AT THE STAKE\r\n\r\nArriving here at 12 o\'clock the train was met by a surging mass of\r\nhumanity 10,000 strong. The negro was placed upon a carnival float in\r\nmockery of a king upon his throne, and, followed by an immense crowd, was\r\nescorted through the city so that all might see the most inhuman monster\r\nknown in current history. The line of march was up Main Street to the\r\nsquare, around the square down Clarksville street to Church Street, thence\r\nto the open prairies about 300 yards from the Texas & Pacific depot. Here\r\nSmith was placed upon a scaffold, six feet square and ten feet high,\r\nsecurely bound, within the view of all beholders. Here the victim was\r\ntortured for fifty minutes by red-hot iron brands thrust against his\r\nquivering body. Commencing at the feet the brands were placed against him\r\ninch by inch until they were thrust against the face. Then, being\r\napparently dead, kerosene was poured upon him, cottonseed hulls placed\r\nbeneath him and set on fire. In less time than it takes to relate it, the\r\ntortured man was wafted beyond the grave to another fire, hotter and more\r\nterrible than the one just experienced.\r\n\r\nCuriosity seekers have carried away already all that was left of the\r\nmemorable event, even to pieces of charcoal. The cause of the crime was\r\nthat Henry Vance when a deputy policeman, in the course of his duty was\r\ncalled to arrest Henry Smith for being drunk and disorderly. The Negro was\r\nunruly, and Vance was forced to use his club. The Negro swore vengeance,\r\nand several times assaulted Vance. In his greed for revenge, last\r\nThursday, he grabbed up the little girl and committed the crime. The\r\nfather is prostrated with grief and the mother now lies at death\'s door,\r\nbut she has lived to see the slayer of her innocent babe suffer the most\r\nhorrible death that could be conceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORTURE BEYOND DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nWords to describe the awful torture inflicted upon Smith cannot be found.\r\nThe Negro, for a long time after starting on the journey to Paris, did not\r\nrealize his plight. At last when he was told that he must die by slow\r\ntorture he begged for protection. His agony was awful. He pleaded and\r\nwrithed in bodily and mental pain. Scarcely had the train reached Paris\r\nthan this torture commenced. His clothes were torn off piecemeal and\r\nscattered in the crowd, people catching the shreds and putting them away\r\nas mementos. The child\'s father, her brother, and two uncles then gathered\r\nabout the Negro as he lay fastened to the torture platform and thrust hot\r\nirons into his quivering flesh. It was horrible--the man dying by slow\r\ntorture in the midst of smoke from his own burning flesh. Every groan from\r\nthe fiend, every contortion of his body was cheered by the thickly packed\r\ncrowd of 10,000 persons. The mass of beings 600 yards in diameter, the\r\nscaffold being the center. After burning the feet and legs, the hot\r\nirons--plenty of fresh ones being at hand--were rolled up and down Smith\'s\r\nstomach, back, and arms. Then the eyes were burned out and irons were\r\nthrust down his throat.\r\n\r\nThe men of the Vance family having wreaked vengeance, the crowd piled all\r\nkinds of combustible stuff around the scaffold, poured oil on it and set\r\nit afire. The Negro rolled and tossed out of the mass, only to be pushed\r\nback by the people nearest him. He tossed out again, and was roped and\r\npulled back. Hundreds of people turned away, but the vast crowd still\r\nlooked calmly on. People were here from every part of this section. They\r\ncame from Dallas, Fort Worth, Sherman, Denison, Bonham, Texarkana, Fort\r\nSmith, Ark., and a party of fifteen came from Hempstead county, Arkansas,\r\nwhere he was captured. Every train that came in was loaded to its utmost\r\ncapacity, and there were demands at many points for special trains to\r\nbring the people here to see the unparalleled punishment for an\r\nunparalleled crime. When the news of the burning went over the country\r\nlike wildfire, at every country town anvils boomed forth the announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ASYLUM\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss in connection with this awful affair, in proof of our\r\nassertion that Smith was an imbecile, to give the testimony of a\r\nwell-known colored minister, who lived at Paris, Texas, at the time of the\r\nlynching. He was a witness of the awful scenes there enacted, and\r\nattempted, in the name of God and humanity, to interfere in the programme.\r\nHe barely escaped with his life, was driven out of the city and became an\r\nexile because of his actions. Reverend King was in New York about the\r\nmiddle of February, and he was there interviewed for a daily paper for\r\nthat city, and we quote his account as an eye witness of the affair. Said\r\nhe:\r\n\r\n  I was ridden out of Paris on a rail because I was the only man in Lamar\r\n  county to raise my voice against the lynching of Smith. I opposed the\r\n  illegal measures before the arrival of Henry Smith as a prisoner, and I\r\n  was warned that I might meet his fate if I was not careful; but the\r\n  sense of justice made me bold, and when I saw the poor wretch trembling\r\n  with fear, and got so near him that I could hear his teeth chatter, I\r\n  determined to stand by him to the last.\r\n\r\n  I hated him for his crime, but two crimes do not make a virtue; and in\r\n  the brief conversation I had with Smith I was more firmly convinced than\r\n  ever that he was irresponsible.\r\n\r\n  I had known Smith for years, and there were times when Smith was out of\r\n  his head for weeks. Two years ago I made an effort to have him put in an\r\n  asylum, but the white people were trying to fasten the murder of a young\r\n  colored girl upon him, and would not listen. For days before the murder\r\n  of the little Vance girl, Smith was out of his head and dangerous. He\r\n  had just undergone an attack of delirium tremens and was in no condition\r\n  to be allowed at large. He realized his condition, for I spoke with him\r\n  not three weeks ago, and in answer to my exhortations, he promised to\r\n  reform. The next time I saw him was on the day of his execution.\r\n\r\n  "Drink did it! drink did it," he sobbed. Then bowing his face in his\r\n  hands, he asked: "Is it true, did I kill her? Oh, my God, my God!" For a\r\n  moment he seemed to forget the awful fate that awaited him, and his body\r\n  swayed to and fro with grief. Some one seized me by the shoulder and\r\n  hurled me back, and Smith fell writhing to the ground in terror as four\r\n  men seized his arms to drag him to the float on which he was to be\r\n  exhibited before he was finally burned at the stake.\r\n\r\n  I followed the procession and wept aloud as I saw little children of my\r\n  own race follow the unfortunate man and taunt him with jeers. Even at\r\n  the stake, children of both sexes and colors gathered in groups, and\r\n  when the father of the murdered child raised the hissing iron with which\r\n  he was about to torture the helpless victim, the children became as\r\n  frantic as the grown people and struggled forward to obtain places of\r\n  advantage.\r\n\r\n  It was terrible. One little tot scarcely older than little Myrtle Vance\r\n  clapped her baby hands as her father held her on his shoulders above the\r\n  heads of the people.\r\n\r\n  "For God\'s sake," I shouted, "send the children home."\r\n\r\n  "No, no," shouted a hundred maddened voices; "let them learn a lesson."\r\n\r\n  I love children, but as I looked about the little faces distorted with\r\n  passion and the bloodshot eyes of the cruel parents who held them high\r\n  in their arms, I thanked God that I have none of my own.\r\n\r\n  As the hot iron sank deep into poor Henry\'s flesh a hideous yell rent\r\n  the air, and, with a sound as terrible as the cry, of lost souls on\r\n  judgment day, 20,000 maddened people took up the victim\'s cry of agony\r\n  and a prolonged howl of maddened glee rent the air.\r\n\r\n  No one was himself now. Every man, woman and child in that awful crowd\r\n  was worked up to a greater frenzy than that which actuated Smith\'s\r\n  horrible crime. The people were capable of any new atrocity now, and as\r\n  Smith\'s yells became more and more frequent, it was difficult to hold\r\n  the crowd back, so anxious were the savages to participate in the\r\n  sickening tortures.\r\n\r\n  For half an hour I tried to pray as the beads of agony rolled down my\r\n  forehead and bathed my face.\r\n\r\n  For an instant a hush spread over the people. I could stand no more, and\r\n  with a superhuman effort dashed through the compact mass of humanity and\r\n  stood at the foot of the burning scaffold.\r\n\r\n  "In the name of God," I cried, "I command you to cease this torture."\r\n\r\n  The heavy butt of a Winchester rifle descended on my head and I fell to\r\n  the ground. Rough hands seized me and angry men bore me away, and I was\r\n  thankful.\r\n\r\n  At the outskirts of the crowd I was attacked again, and then several\r\n  men, no doubt glad to get away from the fearful place, escorted me to my\r\n  home, where I was allowed to take a small amount of clothing. A jeering\r\n  crowd gathered without, and when I appeared at the door ready hands\r\n  seized me and I was placed upon a rail, and, with curses and oaths,\r\n  taken to the railway station and placed upon a train. As the train moved\r\n  out some one thrust a roll of bills into my hand and said, "God bless\r\n  you, but it was no use."\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he should ever return to Paris, Mr. King said: "I shall\r\nnever go south again. The impressions of that awful day will stay with me\r\nforever."\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNCHING OF INNOCENT MEN\r\n\r\n(Lynched on Account of Relationship)\r\n\r\nIf no other reason appealed to the sober sense of the American people to\r\ncheck the growth of Lynch Law, the absolute unreliability and recklessness\r\nof the mob in inflicting punishment for crimes done, should do so. Several\r\ninstances of this spirit have occurred in the year past. In Louisiana,\r\nnear New Orleans, in July, 1893, Roselius Julian, a colored man, shot and\r\nkilled a white judge, named Victor Estopinal. The cause of the shooting\r\nhas never been definitely ascertained. It is claimed that the Negro\r\nresented an insult to his wife, and the killing of the white man was an\r\nact of a Negro (who dared) to defend his home. The judge was killed in the\r\ncourt house, and Julian, heavily armed, made his escape to the swamps near\r\nthe city. He has never been apprehended, nor has any information ever been\r\ngleaned as to his whereabouts. A mob determined to secure the fugitive\r\nmurderer and burn him alive. The swamps were hunted through and through in\r\nvain, when, being unable to wreak their revenge upon the murderer, the mob\r\nturned its attention to his unfortunate relatives. Dispatches from New\r\nOrleans, dated September 19, 1893, described the affair as follows:\r\n\r\n  Posses were immediately organized and the surrounding country was\r\n  scoured, but the search was fruitless so far as the real criminal was\r\n  concerned. The mother, three brothers and two sisters of the Negro were\r\n  arrested yesterday at the Black Ridge in the rear of the city by the\r\n  police and taken to the little jail on Judge Estopinal\'s place about\r\n  Southport, because of the belief that they were succoring the fugitive.\r\n\r\n  About 11 o\'clock twenty-five men, some armed with rifles and shotguns,\r\n  came up to the jail. They unlocked the door and held a conference among\r\n  themselves as to what they should do. Some were in favor of hanging the\r\n  five, while others insisted that only two of the brothers should be\r\n  strung up. This was finally agreed to, and the two doomed negroes were\r\n  hurried to a pasture one hundred yards distant, and there asked to take\r\n  their last chance of saving their lives by making a confession, but the\r\n  Negroes made no reply. They were then told to kneel down and pray. One\r\n  did so, the other remained standing, but both prayed fervently. The\r\n  taller Negro was then hoisted up. The shorter Negro stood gazing at the\r\n  horrible death of his brother without flinching. Five minutes later he\r\n  was also hanged. The mob decided to take the remaining brother out to\r\n  Camp Parapet and hang him there. The other two were to be taken out and\r\n  flogged, with an order to get out of the parish in less than half an\r\n  hour. The third brother, Paul, was taken out to the camp, which is about\r\n  a mile distant in the interior, and there he was hanged to a tree.\r\n\r\nAnother young man, who was in no way related to Julian, who perhaps did\r\nnot even know the man and who was entirely innocent of any offense in\r\nconnection therewith, was murdered by the same mob. The same paper says:\r\n\r\n  During the search for Julian on Saturday one branch of the posse visited\r\n  the house of a Negro family in the neighborhood of Camp Parapet, and\r\n  failing to find the object of their search, tried to induce John Willis,\r\n  a young Negro, to disclose the whereabouts of Julian. He refused to do\r\n  so, or could not do so, and was kicked to death by the gang.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIANA CASE\r\n\r\nAlmost equal to the ferocity of the mob which killed the three brothers,\r\nJulian and the unoffending, John Willis, because of the murder of Judge\r\nEstopinal, was the action of a mob near Vincennes, Ind. In this case a\r\nwealthy colored man, named Allen Butler, who was well known in the\r\ncommunity, and enjoyed the confidence and respect of the entire country,\r\nwas made the victim of a mob and hung because his son had become unduly\r\nintimate with a white girl who was a servant around his house. There was\r\nno pretense that the facts were otherwise than as here stated. The woman\r\nlived at Butler\'s house as a servant, and she and Butler\'s son fell in\r\nlove with each other, and later it was found that the girl was in a\r\ndelicate condition. It was claimed, but with how much truth no one has\r\never been able to tell, that the father had procured an abortion, or\r\nhimself had operated on the girl, and that she had left the house to go\r\nback to her home. It was never claimed that the father was in any way\r\nresponsible for the action of his son, but the authorities procured the\r\narrest of both father and son, and at the preliminary examination the\r\nfather gave bail to appear before the Grand Jury when it should convene.\r\nOn the same night, however, the mob took the matter in hand and with the\r\nintention of hanging the son. It assembled near Sumner, while the boy, who\r\nhad been unable to give bail, was lodged in jail at Lawrenceville. As it\r\nwas impossible to reach Lawrenceville and hang the son, the leaders of the\r\nmob concluded they would go to Butler\'s house and hang him. Butler was\r\nfound at his home, taken out by the mob and hung to a tree. This was in\r\nthe lawabiding state of Indiana, which furnished the United States its\r\nlast president and which claims all the honor, pride and glory of northern\r\ncivilization. None of the leaders of the mob were apprehended, and no\r\nsteps whatever were taken to bring the murderers to justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLED FOR HIS STEPFATHER\'S CRIME\r\n\r\nAn account has been given of the cremation of Henry Smith, at Paris,\r\nTexas, for the murder of the infant child of a man named Vance. It would\r\nappear that human ferocity was not sated when it vented itself upon a\r\nhuman being by burning his eyes out, by thrusting a red-hot iron down his\r\nthroat, and then by burning his body to ashes. Henry Smith, the victim of\r\nthese savage orgies, was beyond all the power of torture, but a few miles\r\noutside of Paris, some members of the community concluded that it would be\r\nproper to kill a stepson named William Butler as a partial penalty for the\r\noriginal crime. This young man, against whom no word has ever been said,\r\nand who was in fact an orderly, peaceable boy, had been watched with the\r\nseverest scrutiny by members of the mob who believed he knew something of\r\nthe whereabouts of Smith. He declared from the very first that he did not\r\nknow where his stepfather was, which statement was well proven to be a\r\nfact after the discovery of Smith in Arkansas, whence he had fled through\r\nswamps and woods and unfrequented places. Yet Butler was apprehended,\r\nplaced under arrest, and on the night of February 6, taken out on Hickory\r\nCreek, five miles southeast of Paris, and hung for his stepfather\'s crime.\r\nAfter his body was suspended in the air, the mob filled it with bullets.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNCHED BECAUSE THE JURY ACQUITTED HIM\r\n\r\nThe entire system of the judiciary of this country is in the hands of\r\nwhite people. To this add the fact of the inherent prejudice against\r\ncolored people, and it will be clearly seen that a white jury is certain\r\nto find a Negro prisoner guilty if there is the least evidence to warrant\r\nsuch a finding.\r\n\r\nMeredith Lewis was arrested in Roseland, La., in July of last year. A\r\nwhite jury found him not guilty of the crime of murder wherewith he stood\r\ncharged. This did not suit the mob. A few nights after the verdict was\r\nrendered, and he declared to be innocent, a mob gathered in his vicinity\r\nand went to his house. He was called, and suspecting nothing, went\r\noutside. He was seized and hurried off to a convenient spot and hanged by\r\nthe neck until he was dead for the murder of a woman of which the jury had\r\nsaid he was innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNCHED AS A SCAPEGOAT\r\n\r\nWednesday, July 5, about 10 o\'clock in the morning, a terrible crime was\r\ncommitted within four miles of Wickliffe, Ky. Two girls, Mary and Ruby\r\nRay, were found murdered a short distance from their home. The news of\r\nthis terrible cowardly murder of two helpless young girls spread like wild\r\nfire, and searching parties scoured the territory surrounding Wickliffe\r\nand Bardwell. Two of the searching party, the Clark brothers, saw a man\r\nenter the Dupoyster cornfield; they got their guns and fired at the\r\nfleeing figure, but without effect; he got away, but they said he was a\r\nwhite man or nearly so. The search continued all day without effect, save\r\nthe arrest of two or three strange Negroes. A bloodhound was brought from\r\nthe penitentiary and put on the trail which he followed from the scene of\r\nthe murder to the river and into the boat of a fisherman named Gordon.\r\nGordon stated that he had ferried one man and only one across the river\r\nabout about half past six the evening of July 5; that his passenger sat in\r\nfront of him, and he was a white man or a very bright mulatto, who could\r\nnot be told from a white man. The bloodhound was put across the river in\r\nthe boat, and he struck a trail again at Bird\'s Point on the Missouri\r\nside, ran about three hundred yards to the cottage of a white farmer named\r\nGrant and there lay down refusing to go further.\r\n\r\nThursday morning a brakesman on a freight train going out of Sikeston,\r\nMo., discovered a Negro stealing a ride; he ordered him off and had hot\r\nwords which terminated in a fight. The brakesman had the Negro arrested.\r\nWhen arrested, between 11 and 12 o\'clock, he had on a dark woolen shirt,\r\nlight pants and coat, and no vest. He had twelve dollars in paper, two\r\nsilver dollars and ninety-five cents in change; he had also four rings in\r\nhis pockets, a knife and a razor which were rusted and stained. The\r\nSikeston authorities immediately jumped to the conclusion that this man\r\nwas the murderer for whom the Kentuckians across the river were searching.\r\nThey telegraphed to Bardwell that their prisoner had on no coat, but wore\r\na blue vest and pants which would perhaps correspond with the coat found\r\nat the scene of the murder, and that the names of the murdered girls were\r\nin the rings found in his possession.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this news was received, the sheriffs of Ballard and Carlisle\r\ncounties and a posse(?) of thirty well-armed and determined Kentuckians,\r\nwho had pledged their word the prisoner should be taken back to the scene\r\nof the supposed crime, to be executed there if proved to be the guilty\r\nman, chartered a train and at nine o\'clock Thursday night started for\r\nSikeston. Arriving there two hours later, the sheriff at Sikeston, who had\r\nno warrant for the prisoner\'s arrest and detention, delivered him into the\r\nhands of the mob without authority for so doing, and accompanied them to\r\nBird\'s Point. The prisoner gave his name as Miller, his home at\r\nSpringfield, and said he had never been in Kentucky in his life, but the\r\nsheriff turned him over to the mob to be taken to Wickliffe, that Frank\r\nGordon, the fisherman, who had put a man across the river might identify\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the protection of the law was withdrawn from C.J. Miller,\r\nand he was given to a mob by this sheriff at Sikeston, who knew that the\r\nprisoner\'s life depended on one man\'s word. After an altercation with the\r\ntrain men, who wanted another $50 for taking the train back to Bird\'s\r\nPoint, the crowd arrived there at three o\'clock, Friday morning. Here was\r\nanchored _The Three States_, a ferryboat plying between Wickliffe, Ky,\r\nCairo, Ill., and Bird\'s Point, Mo. This boat left Cairo at twelve o\'clock,\r\nThursday, with nearly three hundred of Cairo\'s best(?) citizens and thirty\r\nkegs of beer on board. This was consumed while the crowd and the\r\nbloodhound waited for the prisoner.\r\n\r\nWhen the prisoner was on board _The Three States_ the dog was turned\r\nloose, and after moving aimlessly around, followed the crowd to where\r\nMiller sat handcuffed and there stopped. The crowd closed in on the pair\r\nand insisted that the brute had identified him because of that action.\r\nWhen the boat reached Wickliffe, Gordon, the fisherman, was called on to\r\nsay whether the prisoner was the man he ferried over the river the day of\r\nthe murder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lynching of C.J. Miller, at Bardwell, Kentucky, July 7,\r\n1893.]\r\n\r\nThe sheriff of Ballard County informed him, sternly that if the prisoner\r\nwas not the man, he (the fisherman) would be held responsible as knowing\r\nwho the guilty man was. Gordon stated before, that the man he ferried\r\nacross was a white man or a bright colored man; Miller was a dark brown\r\nskinned man, with kinky hair, "neither yellow nor black," says the _Cairo\r\nEvening Telegram_ of Friday, July 7. The fisherman went up to Miller from\r\nbehind, looked at him without speaking for fully five minutes, then slowly\r\nsaid, "Yes, that\'s the man I crossed over." This was about six o\'clock,\r\nFriday morning, and the crowd wished to hang Miller then and there. But\r\nMr. Ray, the father of the girls, insisted that he be taken to Bardwell,\r\nthe county seat of Ballard, and twelve miles inland. He said he thought a\r\nwhite man committed the crime, and that he was not satisfied that was the\r\nman. They took him to Bardwell and at ten o\'clock, this same excited,\r\nunauthorized mob undertook to determine Miller\'s guilt. One of the Clark\r\nbrothers who shot at a fleeing man in the Dupoyster cornfield, said the\r\nprisoner was the same man; the other said he was not, but the testimony of\r\nthe first was accepted. A colored woman who had said she gave breakfast to\r\na colored man clad in a blue flannel suit the morning of the murder, said\r\npositively that she had never seen Miller before. The gold rings found in\r\nhis possession had no names in them, as had been asserted, and Mr. Ray\r\nsaid they did not belong to his daughters. Meantime a funeral pyre for the\r\npurpose of burning Miller to death had been erected in the center of the\r\nvillage. While the crowd swayed by passion was clamoring that he be burnt,\r\nMiller stepped forward and made the following statement: "My name is\r\nC.J. Miller. I am from Springfield, Ill.; my wife lives at 716 N. 2d\r\nStreet. I am here among you today, looked upon as one of the most brutal\r\nmen before the people. I stand here surrounded by men who are excited, men\r\nwho are not willing to let the law take its course, and as far as the\r\ncrime is concerned, I have committed no crime, and certainly no crime\r\ngross enough to deprive me of my life and liberty to walk upon the green\r\nearth."\r\n\r\nA telegram was sent to the chief of the police at Springfield, Ill.,\r\nasking if one C.J. Miller lived there. An answer in the negative was\r\nreturned. A few hours after, it was ascertained that a man named Miller,\r\nand his wife, did live at the number the prisoner gave in his speech, but\r\nthe information came to Bardwell too late to do the prisoner any good.\r\nMiller was taken to jail, every stitch of clothing literally torn from his\r\nbody and examined again. On the lower left side of the bosom of his shirt\r\nwas found a dark reddish spot about the size of a dime. Miller said it was\r\npaint which he had gotten on him at Jefferson Barracks. This spot was only\r\non the right side, and could not be seen from the under side at all, thus\r\nshowing it had not gone through the cloth as blood or any liquid substance\r\nwould do.\r\n\r\nChief-of-Police Mahaney, of Cairo, Ill., was with the prisoner, and he\r\ntook his knife and scraped at the spot, particles of which came off in his\r\nhand. Miller told them to take his clothes to any expert, and if the spot\r\nwas shown to be blood, they might do anything they wished with him. They\r\ntook his clothes away and were gone some time. After a while they were\r\nbrought back and thrown into the cell without a word. It is needless to\r\nsay that if the spot had been found to be blood, that fact would have been\r\nannounced, and the shirt retained as evidence. Meanwhile numbers of rough,\r\ndrunken men crowded into the cell and tried to force a confession of the\r\ndeed from the prisoner\'s lips. He refused to talk save to reiterate his\r\ninnocence. To Mr. Mahaney, who talked seriously and kindly to him, telling\r\nhim the mob meant to burn and torture him at three o\'clock, Miller said:\r\n"Burning and torture here lasts but a little while, but if I die with a\r\nlie on my soul, I shall be tortured forever. I am innocent." For more than\r\nthree hours, all sorts of pressure in the way of threats, abuse and\r\nurging, was brought to bear to force him to confess to the murder and thus\r\njustify the mob in its deed of murder. Miller remained firm; but as the\r\nhour drew near, and the crowd became more impatient, he asked for a\r\npriest. As none could be procured, he then asked for a Methodist minister,\r\nwho came, prayed with the doomed man, baptized him and exhorted Miller to\r\nconfess. To keep up the flagging spirits of the dense crowd around the\r\njail, the rumor went out more than once, that Miller had confessed. But\r\nthe solemn assurance of the minister, chief-of-police, and leading\r\neditor--who were with Miller all along--is that this rumor is absolutely\r\nfalse.\r\n\r\nAt three o\'clock the mob rushed to the jail to secure the prisoner. Mr.\r\nRay had changed his mind about the promised burning; he was still in doubt\r\nas to the prisoner\'s guilt. He again addressed the crowd to that effect,\r\nurging them not to burn Miller, and the mob heeded him so far, that they\r\ncompromised on hanging instead of burning, which was agreed to by Mr. Ray.\r\nThere was a loud yell, and a rush was made for the prisoner. He was\r\nstripped naked, his clothing literally torn from his body, and his shirt\r\nwas tied around his loins. Some one declared the rope was a "white man\'s\r\ndeath," and a log-chain, nearly a hundred feet in length, weighing over\r\none hundred pounds, was placed round Miller\'s neck and body, and he was\r\nled and dragged through the streets of the village in that condition\r\nfollowed by thousands of people. He fainted from exhaustion several times,\r\nbut was supported to the platform where they first intended burning him.\r\n\r\nThe chain was hooked around his neck, a man climbed the telegraph pole and\r\nthe other end of the chain was passed up to him and made fast to the\r\ncross-arm. Others brought a long forked stick which Miller was made to\r\nstraddle. By this means he was raised several feet from the ground and\r\nthen let fall. The first fall broke his neck, but he was raised in this\r\nway and let fall a second time. Numberless shots were fired into the\r\ndangling body, for most of that crowd were heavily armed, and had been\r\ndrinking all day.\r\n\r\nMiller\'s body hung thus exposed from three to five o\'clock, during which\r\ntime, several photographs of him as he hung dangling at the end of the\r\nchain were taken, and his toes and fingers were cut off. His body was\r\ntaken down, placed on the platform, the torch applied, and in a few\r\nmoments there was nothing left of C.J. Miller save a few bones and ashes.\r\nThus perished another of the many victims of Lynch Law, but it is the\r\nhonest and sober belief of many who witnessed the scene that an innocent\r\nman has been barbarously and shockingly put to death in the glare of the\r\nnineteenth-century civilization, by those who profess to believe in\r\nChristianity, law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nLYNCHED FOR ANYTHING OR NOTHING\r\n\r\n(_Lynched for Wife Beating_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn nearly all communities wife beating is punishable with a fine, and in\r\nno community is it made a felony. Dave Jackson, of Abita, La., was a\r\ncolored man who had beaten his wife. He had not killed her, nor seriously\r\nwounded her, but as Louisiana lynchers had not filled out their quota of\r\ncrimes, his case was deemed of sufficient importance to apply the method\r\nof that barbarous people. He was in the custody of the officials, but the\r\nmob went to the jail and took him out in front of the prison and hanged\r\nhim by the neck until he was dead. This was in Nov. 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANGED FOR STEALING HOGS\r\n\r\nDetails are very meagre of a lynching which occurred near Knox Point, La.,\r\non the twenty-fourth of October, 1893. Upon one point, however, there was\r\nno uncertainty, and that is, that the persons lynched were Negroes. It was\r\nclaimed that they had been stealing hogs, but even this claim had not been\r\nsubjected to the investigation of a court. That matter was not considered\r\nnecessary. A few of the neighbors who had lost hogs suspected these men\r\nwere responsible for their loss, and made up their minds to furnish an\r\nexample for others to be warned by. The two men were secured by a mob and\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNCHED FOR NO OFFENSE\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most characteristic feature of this record of lynch law for\r\nthe year 1893, is the remarkable fact that five human beings were lynched\r\nand that the matter was considered of so little importance that the\r\npowerful press bureaus of the country did not consider the matter of\r\nenough importance to ascertain the causes for which they were hanged. It\r\ntells the world, with perhaps greater emphasis than any other feature of\r\nthe record, that Lynch Law has become so common in the United States that\r\nthe finding of the dead body of a Negro, suspended between heaven and\r\nearth to the limb of a tree, is of so slight importance that neither the\r\ncivil authorities nor press agencies consider the matter worth\r\ninvestigating. July 21, in Shelby County, Tenn., a colored man by the name\r\nof Charles Martin was lynched. July 30, at Paris, Mo., a colored man named\r\nWilliam Steen shared the same fate. December 28, Mack Segars was announced\r\nto have been lynched at Brantley, Alabama. August 31, at Yarborough,\r\nTexas, and on September 19, at Houston, a colored man was found lynched,\r\nbut so little attention was paid to the matter that not only was no record\r\nmade as to why these last two men were lynched, but even their names were\r\nnot given. The dispatches simply stated that an unknown Negro was found\r\nlynched in each case.\r\n\r\nThere are friends of humanity who feel their souls shrink from any\r\ncompromise with murder, but whose deep and abiding reverence for womanhood\r\ncauses them to hesitate in giving their support to this crusade against\r\nLynch Law, out of fear that they may encourage the miscreants whose deeds\r\nare worse than murder. But to these friends it must appear certain that\r\nthese five men could not have been guilty of any terrible crime. They were\r\nsimply lynched by parties of men who had it in their power to kill them,\r\nand who chose to avenge some fancied wrong by murder, rather than submit\r\ntheir grievances to court.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNCHED BECAUSE THEY WERE SAUCY\r\n\r\nAt Moberly, Mo., February 18 and at Fort Madison, S.C., June 2, both in\r\n1892, a record was made in the line of lynching which should certainly\r\nappeal to every humanitarian who has any regard for the sacredness of\r\nhuman life. John Hughes, of Moberly, and Isaac Lincoln, of Fort Madison,\r\nand Will Lewis in Tullahoma, Tenn., suffered death for no more serious\r\ncharge than that they "were saucy to white people." In the days of slavery\r\nit was held to be a very serious matter for a colored person to fail to\r\nyield the sidewalk at the demand of a white person, and it will not be\r\nsurprising to find some evidence of this intolerance existing in the days\r\nof freedom. But the most that could be expected as a penalty for acting or\r\nspeaking saucily to a white person would be a slight physical chastisement\r\nto make the Negro "know his place" or an arrest and fine. But Missouri,\r\nTennessee and South Carolina chose to make precedents in their cases and\r\nas a result both men, after being charged with their offense and\r\napprehended, were taken by a mob and lynched. The civil authorities, who\r\nin either case would have been very quick to satisfy the aggrieved white\r\npeople had they complained and brought the prisoners to court, by imposing\r\nproper penalty upon them, did not feel it their duty to make any\r\ninvestigation after the Negroes were killed. They were dead and out of the\r\nway and as no one would be called upon to render an account for their\r\ntaking off, the matter was dismissed from the public mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNCHED FOR A QUARREL\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable instances of lynching for the year 1893, occurred\r\nabout the twentieth of September. It was notable for the fact that the\r\nmayor of the city exerted every available power to protect the victim of\r\nthe lynching from the mob. In his splendid endeavor to uphold the law, the\r\nmayor called out the troops, and the result was a deadly fight between the\r\nmilitia and mob, nine of the mob being killed. The trouble occurred at\r\nRoanoke, Va. It is frequently claimed that lynchings occur only in\r\nsparsely settled districts, and, in fact, it is a favorite plea of\r\ngovernors and reverend apologists to couple two arrant falsehoods, stating\r\nthat lynchings occur only because of assaults upon white women, and that\r\nthese assaults occur and the lynchings follow in thinly inhabited\r\ndistricts where the power of the law is entirely inadequate to meet the\r\nemergency. This Roanoke case is a double refutation, for it not only\r\ndisproves the alleged charge that the Negro assaulted a white woman, as\r\nwas telegraphed all over the country at the time, but it also shows\r\nconclusively that even in one of the largest cities of the old state of\r\nVirginia, one of the original thirteen colonies, which prides itself of\r\nbeing the mother of presidents, it was possible for a lynching to occur in\r\nbroad daylight under circumstances of revolting savagery.\r\n\r\nWhen the news first came from Roanoke of the contemplated lynching, it was\r\nstated that a big burly Negro had assaulted a white woman, that he had\r\nbeen apprehended and that the citizens were determined to summarily\r\ndispose of his case. Mayor Trout was a man who believed in maintaining the\r\nmajesty of the law, and who at once gave notice that no lynching would be\r\npermitted in Roanoke, and that the Negro, whose name was Smith, being in\r\nthe custody of the law, should be dealt with according to law; but the mob\r\ndid not pay any attention to the brave words of the mayor. It evidently\r\nthought that it was only another case of swagger, such as frequently\r\ncharacterizes lynching episodes. Mayor Trout, finding immense crowds\r\ngathering about the city, and fearing an attempt to lynch Smith, called\r\nout the militia and stationed them at the jail.\r\n\r\nIt was known that the woman refused to accuse Smith of assaulting her, and\r\nthat his offense consisted in quarreling with her about the change of\r\nmoney in a transaction in which he bought something from her market booth.\r\nBoth parties lost their temper, and the result was a row from which Smith\r\nhad to make his escape. At once the old cry was sounded that the woman had\r\nbeen assaulted, and in a few hours all the town was wild with people\r\nthirsting for the assailant\'s blood. The further incidents of that day may\r\nwell be told by a dispatch from Roanoke under date of the twenty-first of\r\nSeptember and published in the _Chicago Record_. It says:\r\n\r\n  It is claimed by members of the military company that they frequently\r\n  warned the mob to keep away from the jail, under penalty of being shot.\r\n  Capt. Bird told them he was under orders to protect the prisoner whose\r\n  life the mob so eagerly sought, and come what may he would not allow him\r\n  to be taken by the mob. To this the crowd replied with hoots and\r\n  derisive jeers. The rioters appeared to become frenzied at the\r\n  determined stand taken by the men and Captain Bird, and finally a crowd\r\n  of excited men made a rush for the side door of the jail. The captain\r\n  directed his men to drive the would-be lynchers back.\r\n\r\n  At this moment the mob opened fire on the soldiers. This appeared for a\r\n  moment to startle the captain and his men. But it was only for a moment.\r\n  Then he coolly gave the command: "Ready! aim! fire!" The company obeyed\r\n  to the instant, and poured a volley of bullets into that part of the\r\n  mob which was trying to batter down the side door of the jail.\r\n\r\n  The rioters fell back before the fire of the militia, leaving one man\r\n  writhing in the agonies of death at the doorstep. There was a lull for a\r\n  moment. Then the word was quickly passed through the throng in front of\r\n  the jail and down the street that a man was killed. Then there was an\r\n  awful rush toward the little band of soldiers. Excited men were yelling\r\n  like demons.\r\n\r\n  The fight became general, and ere it was ended nine men were dead and\r\n  more than forty wounded.\r\n\r\nThis stubborn stand on behalf of law and order disconcerted the crowd and\r\nit fell back in disorder. It did not long remain inactive but assembled\r\nagain for a second assault. Having only a small band of militia, and\r\nknowing they would be absolutely at the mercy of the thousands who were\r\ngathering to wreak vengeance upon them, the mayor ordered them to disperse\r\nand go to their homes, and he himself, having been wounded, was quietly\r\nconveyed out of the city.\r\n\r\nThe next day the mob grew in numbers and its rage increased in its\r\nintensity. There was no longer any doubt that Smith, innocent as he was of\r\nany crime, would be killed, for with the mayor out of the city and the\r\ngovernor of the state using no effort to control the mob, it was only a\r\nquestion of a few hours when the assault would be repeated and its victim\r\nput to death. All this happened as per programme. The description of that\r\nmorning\'s carnival appeared in the paper above quoted and reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  A squad of twenty men took the negro Smith from three policemen just\r\n  before five o\'clock this morning and hanged him to a hickory limb on\r\n  Ninth Avenue, in the residence section of the city. They riddled his\r\n  body with bullets and put a placard on it saying: "This is Mayor Trout\'s\r\n  friend." A coroner\'s jury of Bismel was summoned and viewed the body and\r\n  rendered a verdict of death at the hands of unknown men. Thousands of\r\n  persons visited the scene of the lynching between daylight and eight\r\n  o\'clock when the body was cut down. After the jury had completed its\r\n  work the body was placed in the hands of officers, who were unable to\r\n  keep back the mob. Three hundred men tried to drag the body through the\r\n  streets of the town, but the Rev. Dr. Campbell of the First Presbyterian\r\n  church and Capt. R.B. Moorman, with pleas and by force prevented them.\r\n\r\n  Capt. Moorman hired a wagon and the body was put in it. It was then\r\n  conveyed to the bank of the Roanoke, about two miles from the scene of\r\n  the lynching. Here the body was dragged from the wagon by ropes for\r\n  about 200 yards and burned. Piles of dry brushwood were brought, and the\r\n  body was placed upon it, and more brushwood piled on the body, leaving\r\n  only the head bare. The whole pile was then saturated with coal oil and\r\n  a match was applied. The body was consumed within an hour. The cremation\r\n  was witnessed by several thousand people. At one time the mob threatened\r\n  to burn the Negro in Mayor Trout\'s yard.\r\n\r\nThus did the people of Roanoke, Va., add this measure of proof to maintain\r\nour contention that it is only necessary to charge a Negro with a crime in\r\norder to secure his certain death. It was well known in the city before he\r\nwas killed that he had not assaulted the woman with whom he had had the\r\ntrouble, but he dared to have an altercation with a white woman, and he\r\nmust pay the penalty. For an offense which would not in any civilized\r\ncommunity have brought upon him a punishment greater than a fine of a few\r\ndollars, this unfortunate Negro was hung, shot and burned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSPECTED, INNOCENT AND LYNCHED\r\n\r\nFive persons, Benjamin Jackson, his wife, Mahala Jackson, his\r\nmother-in-law, Lou Carter, Rufus Bigley, were lynched near Quincy, Miss.,\r\nthe charge against them being suspicion of well poisoning. It appears from\r\nthe newspaper dispatches at that time that a family by the name of\r\nWoodruff was taken ill in September of 1892. As a result of their illness\r\none or more of the family are said to have died, though that matter is not\r\nstated definitely. It was suspected that the cause of their illness was\r\nthe existence of poison in the water, some miscreant having placed poison\r\nin the well. Suspicion pointed to a colored man named Benjamin Jackson who\r\nwas at once arrested. With him also were arrested his wife and\r\nmother-in-law and all were held on the same charge.\r\n\r\nThe matter came up for judicial investigation, but as might have been\r\nexpected, the white people concluded it was unnecessary to wait the result\r\nof the investigation--that it was preferable to hang the accused first and\r\ntry him afterward. By this method of procedure, the desired result was\r\nalways obtained--the accused was hanged. Accordingly Benjamin Jackson was\r\ntaken from the officers by a crowd of about two hundred people, while the\r\ninquest was being held, and hanged. After the killing of Jackson, the\r\ninquest was continued to ascertain the possible connection of the other\r\npersons charged with the crime. Against the wife and mother-in-law of the\r\nunfortunate man there was not the slightest evidence and the coroner\'s\r\njury was fair enough to give them their liberty. They were declared\r\ninnocent and returned to their homes. But this did not protect the women\r\nfrom the demands of the Christian white people of that section of the\r\ncountry. In any other land and with any other people, the fact that these\r\ntwo accused persons were women would have pleaded in their favor for\r\nprotection and fair play, but that had no weight with the Mississippi\r\nChristians nor the further fact that a jury of white men had declared them\r\ninnocent. The hanging of one victim on an unproven charge did not begin to\r\nsatisfy the mob in its bloodthirsty demands and the result was that even\r\nafter the women had been discharged, they were at once taken in charge by\r\na mob, which hung them by the neck until they were dead.\r\n\r\nStill the mob was not satisfied. During the coroner\'s investigation the\r\nname of a fourth person, Rufus Bigley, was mentioned. He was acquainted\r\nwith the Jacksons and that fact, together with some testimony adduced at\r\nthe inquest, prompted the mob to decide that he should die also. Search\r\nwas at once made for him and the next day he was apprehended. He was not\r\ngiven over into the hands of the civil authorities for trial nor did the\r\ncoroner\'s inquest find that he was guilty, but the mob was quite\r\nsufficient in itself. After finding Bigley, he was strung up to a tree and\r\nhis body left hanging, where it was found next day. It may be remarked\r\nhere in passing that this instance of the moral degradation of the people\r\nof Mississippi did not excite any interest in the public at large.\r\nAmerican Christianity heard of this awful affair and read of its details\r\nand neither press nor pulpit gave the matter more than a passing comment.\r\nHad it occurred in the wilds of interior Africa, there would have been an\r\noutcry from the humane people of this country against the savagery which\r\nwould so mercilessly put men and women to death. But it was an evidence of\r\nAmerican civilization to be passed by unnoticed, to be denied or condoned\r\nas the requirements of any future emergency might determine.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNCHED FOR AN ATTEMPTED ASSAULT\r\n\r\nWith only a little more aggravation than that of Smith who quarreled at\r\nRoanoke with the market woman, was the assault which operated as the\r\nincentive to a most brutal lynching in Memphis, Tenn. Memphis is one of\r\nthe queen cities of the south, with a population of about seventy thousand\r\nsouls--easily one of the twenty largest, most progressive and wealthiest\r\ncities of the United States. And yet in its streets there occurred a scene\r\nof shocking savagery which would have disgraced the Congo. No woman was\r\nharmed, no serious indignity suffered. Two women driving to town in a\r\nwagon, were suddenly accosted by Lee Walker. He claimed that he demanded\r\nsomething to eat. The women claimed that he attempted to assault them.\r\nThey gave such an alarm that he ran away. At once the dispatches spread\r\nover the entire country that a big, burly Negro had brutally assaulted two\r\nwomen. Crowds began to search for the alleged fiend. While hunting him\r\nthey shot another Negro dead in his tracks for refusing to stop when\r\nordered to do so. After a few days Lee Walker was found, and put in jail\r\nin Memphis until the mob there was ready for him.\r\n\r\nThe _Memphis Commercial_ of Sunday, July 23, contains a full account of\r\nthe tragedy from which the following extracts are made:\r\n\r\n  At 12 o\'clock last night, Lee Walker, who attempted to outrage Miss\r\n  Mollie McCadden, last Tuesday morning, was taken from the county jail\r\n  and hanged to a telegraph pole just north of the prison. All day rumors\r\n  were afloat that with nightfall an attack would be made upon the jail,\r\n  and as everyone anticipated that a vigorous resistance would be made, a\r\n  conflict between the mob and the authorities was feared.\r\n\r\n  At 10 o\'clock Capt. O\'Haver, Sergt. Horan and several patrolmen were on\r\n  hand, but they could do nothing with the crowd. An attack by the mob was\r\n  made on the door in the south wall, and it yielded. Sheriff McLendon and\r\n  several of his men threw themselves into the breach, but two or three of\r\n  the storming party shoved by. They were seized by the police, but were\r\n  not subdued, the officers refraining from using their clubs. The entire\r\n  mob might at first have been dispersed by ten policemen who would use\r\n  their clubs, but the sheriff insisted that no violence be done.\r\n\r\n  The mob got an iron rail and used it as a battering ram against the\r\n  lobby doors. Sheriff McLendon tried to stop them, and some one of the\r\n  mob knocked him down with a chair. Still he counseled moderation and\r\n  would not order his deputies and the police to disperse the crowd by\r\n  force. The pacific policy of the sheriff impressed the mob with the idea\r\n  that the officers were afraid, or at least would do them no harm, and\r\n  they redoubled their efforts, urged on by a big switchman. At 12 o\'clock\r\n  the door of the prison was broken in with a rail.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the rapist was brought out of the door calls were heard for a\r\n  rope; then someone shouted, "Burn him!" But there was no time to make a\r\n  fire. When Walker got into the lobby a dozen of the men began beating\r\n  and stabbing him. He was half dragged, half carried to the corner of\r\n  Front Street and the alley between Sycamore and Mill, and hung to a\r\n  telegraph pole.\r\n\r\n  Walker made a desperate resistance. Two men entered his cell first and\r\n  ordered him to come forth. He refused, and they failing to drag him out,\r\n  others entered. He scratched and bit his assailants, wounding several of\r\n  them severely with his teeth. The mob retaliated by striking and cutting\r\n  him with fists and knives. When he reached the steps leading down to the\r\n  door he made another stand and was stabbed again and again. By the time\r\n  he reached the lobby his power to resist was gone, and he was shoved\r\n  along through the mob of yelling, cursing men and boys, who beat, spat\r\n  upon and slashed the wretch-like demon. One of the leaders of the mob\r\n  fell, and the crowd walked ruthlessly over him. He was badly hurt--a\r\n  jawbone fractured and internal injuries inflicted. After the lynching\r\n  friends took charge of him.\r\n\r\n  The mob proceeded north on Front Street with the victim, stopping at\r\n  Sycamore Street to get a rope from a grocery. "Take him to the iron\r\n  bridge on Main Street," yelled several men. The men who had hold of the\r\n  Negro were in a hurry to finish the job, however, and when they reached\r\n  the telephone pole at the corner of Front Street and the first alley\r\n  north of Sycamore they stopped. A hastily improvised noose was slipped\r\n  over the Negro\'s head, and several young men mounted a pile of lumber\r\n  near the pole and threw the rope over one of the iron stepping pins. The\r\n  Negro was lifted up until his feet were three feet above the ground, the\r\n  rope was made taut, and a corpse dangled in midair. A big fellow who\r\n  helped lead the mob pulled the Negro\'s legs until his neck cracked. The\r\n  wretch\'s clothes had been torn off, and, as he swung, the man who pulled\r\n  his legs mutilated the corpse.\r\n\r\n  One or two knife cuts, more or less, made little difference in the\r\n  appearance of the dead rapist, however, for before the rope was around\r\n  his neck his skin was cut almost to ribbons. One pistol shot was fired\r\n  while the corpse was hanging. A dozen voices protested against the use\r\n  of firearms, and there was no more shooting. The body was permitted to\r\n  hang for half an hour, then it was cut down and the rope divided among\r\n  those who lingered around the scene of the tragedy. Then it was\r\n  suggested that the corpse be burned, and it was done. The entire\r\n  performance, from the assault on the jail to the burning of the dead\r\n  Negro was witnessed by a score or so of policemen and as many deputy\r\n  sheriffs, but not a hand was lifted to stop the proceedings after the\r\n  jail door yielded.\r\n\r\n  As the body hung to the telegraph pole, blood streaming down from the\r\n  knife wounds in his neck, his hips and lower part of his legs also\r\n  slashed with knives, the crowd hurled expletives at him, swung the body\r\n  so that it was dashed against the pole, and, so far from the ghastly\r\n  sight proving trying to the nerves, the crowd looked on with\r\n  complaisance, if not with real pleasure. The Negro died hard. The neck\r\n  was not broken, as the body was drawn up without being given a fall, and\r\n  death came by strangulation. For fully ten minutes after he was strung\r\n  up the chest heaved occasionally, and there were convulsive movements of\r\n  the limbs. Finally he was pronounced dead, and a few minutes later\r\n  Detective Richardson climbed on a pile of staves and cut the rope. The\r\n  body fell in a ghastly heap, and the crowd laughed at the sound and\r\n  crowded around the prostrate body, a few kicking the inanimate carcass.\r\n\r\n  Detective Richardson, who is also a deputy coroner, then proceeded to\r\n  impanel the following jury of inquest: J.S. Moody, A.C. Waldran, B.J.\r\n  Childs, J.N. House, Nelson Bills, T.L. Smith, and A. Newhouse. After\r\n  viewing the body the inquest was adjourned without any testimony being\r\n  taken until 9 o\'clock this morning. The jury will meet at the coroner\'s\r\n  office, 51 Beale Street, upstairs, and decide on a verdict. If no\r\n  witnesses are forthcoming, the jury will be able to arrive at a verdict\r\n  just the same, as all members of it saw the lynching. Then someone\r\n  raised the cry of "Burn him!" It was quickly taken up and soon resounded\r\n  from a hundred throats. Detective Richardson, for a long time,\r\n  single-handed, stood the crowd off. He talked and begged the men not to\r\n  bring disgrace on the city by burning the body, arguing that all the\r\n  vengeance possible had been wrought.\r\n\r\n  While this was going on a small crowd was busy starting a fire in the\r\n  middle of the street. The material was handy. Some bundles of staves\r\n  were taken from the adjoining lumber yard for kindling. Heavier wood was\r\n  obtained from the same source, and coal oil from a neighboring grocery.\r\n  Then the cries of "Burn him! Burn him!" were redoubled.\r\n\r\n  Half a dozen men seized the naked body. The crowd cheered. They marched\r\n  to the fire, and giving the body a swing, it was landed in the middle of\r\n  the fire. There was a cry for more wood, as the fire had begun to die\r\n  owing to the long delay. Willing hands procured the wood, and it was\r\n  piled up on the Negro, almost, for a time, obscuring him from view. The\r\n  head was in plain view, as also were the limbs, and one arm which stood\r\n  out high above the body, the elbow crooked, held in that position by a\r\n  stick of wood. In a few moments the hands began to swell, then came\r\n  great blisters over all the exposed parts of the body; then in places\r\n  the flesh was burned away and the bones began to show through. It was a\r\n  horrible sight, one which, perhaps, none there had ever witnessed\r\n  before. It proved too much for a large part of the crowd and the\r\n  majority of the mob left very shortly after the burning began.\r\n\r\n  But a large number stayed, and were not a bit set back by the sight of a\r\n  human body being burned to ashes. Two or three white women, accompanied\r\n  by their escorts, pushed to the front to obtain an unobstructed view,\r\n  and looked on with astonishing coolness and nonchalance. One man and\r\n  woman brought a little girl, not over twelve years old, apparently their\r\n  daughter, to view a scene which was calculated to drive sleep from the\r\n  child\'s eyes for many nights, if not to produce a permanent injury to\r\n  her nervous system. The comments of the crowd were varied. Some remarked\r\n  on the efficacy of this style of cure for rapists, others rejoiced that\r\n  men\'s wives and daughters were now safe from this wretch. Some laughed\r\n  as the flesh cracked and blistered, and while a large number pronounced\r\n  the burning of a dead body as a useless episode, not in all that throng\r\n  was a word of sympathy heard for the wretch himself.\r\n\r\n  The rope that was used to hang the Negro, and also that which was used\r\n  to lead him from the jail, were eagerly sought by relic hunters. They\r\n  almost fought for a chance to cut off a piece of rope, and in an\r\n  incredibly short time both ropes had disappeared and were scattered in\r\n  the pockets of the crowd in sections of from an inch to six inches long.\r\n  Others of the relic hunters remained until the ashes cooled to obtain\r\n  such ghastly relics as the teeth, nails, and bits of charred skin of the\r\n  immolated victim of his own lust. After burning the body the mob tied a\r\n  rope around the charred trunk and dragged it down Main Street to the\r\n  courthouse, where it was hanged to a center pole. The rope broke and the\r\n  corpse dropped with a thud, but it was again hoisted, the charred legs\r\n  barely touching the ground. The teeth were knocked out and the\r\n  fingernails cut off as souvenirs. The crowd made so much noise that the\r\n  police interfered. Undertaker Walsh was telephoned for, who took\r\n  charge of the body and carried it to his establishment, where it will be\r\n  prepared for burial in the potter\'s field today.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene of lynching at Clanton, Alabama, August 1891.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Facsimile of back of photograph. W.R. MARTIN, Traveling\r\nPhotographer. (Handwritten: This S.O.B. was hung at Clanton Ala. Friday\r\nAug 21st/91 for murdering a little boy in cold blood for 35c in cash. He\r\nis a good specimen of your "Black Christian hung by White Heathens"\r\n[illegible] of the Committee.)]\r\n\r\nA prelude to this exhibition of nineteenth-century barbarism was the\r\nfollowing telegram received by the _Chicago Inter Ocean_, at 2 o\'clock,\r\nSaturday afternoon--ten hours before the lynching:\r\n\r\n  MEMPHIS TENN., July 22, To _Inter-Ocean_, Chicago.\r\n\r\n  Lee Walker, colored man, accused of raping white women, in jail here,\r\n  will be taken out and burned by whites tonight. Can you send Miss Ida\r\n  Wells to write it up? Answer. R.M. Martin, with _Public Ledger_.\r\n\r\nThe _Public Ledger_ is one of the oldest evening daily papers in Memphis,\r\nand this telegram shows that the intentions of the mob were well known\r\nlong before they were executed. The personnel of the mob is given by the\r\n_Memphis Appeal-Avalanche_. It says, "At first it seemed as if a crowd of\r\nroughs were the principals, but as it increased in size, men in all walks\r\nof life figured as leaders, although the majority were young men."\r\n\r\nThis was the punishment meted out to a Negro, charged, not with rape, but\r\nattempted assault, and without any proof as to his guilt, for the women\r\nwere not given a chance to identify him. It was only a little less\r\nhorrible than the burning alive of Henry Smith, at Paris, Texas, February\r\n1, 1893, or that of Edward Coy, in Texarkana, Texas, February 20, 1892.\r\nBoth were charged with assault on white women, and both were tied to the\r\nstake and burned while yet alive, in the presence of ten thousand persons.\r\nIn the case of Coy, the white woman in the case applied the match, even\r\nwhile the victim protested his innocence.\r\n\r\nThe cut which is here given is the exact reproduction of the photograph\r\ntaken at the scene of the lynching at Clanton, Alabama, August, 1891. The\r\ncause for which the man was hanged is given in the words of the mob which\r\nwere written on the back of the photograph, and they are also given. This\r\nphotograph was sent to Judge A.W. Tourgee, of Mayville, N.Y.\r\n\r\nIn some of these cases the mob affects to believe in the Negro\'s guilt.\r\nThe world is told that the white woman in the case identifies him, or the\r\nprisoner "confesses." But in the lynching which took place in Barnwell\r\nCounty, South Carolina, April 24, 1893, the mob\'s victim, John Peterson,\r\nescaped and placed himself under Governor Tillman\'s protection; not only\r\ndid he declare his innocence, but offered to prove an alibi, by white\r\nwitnesses. Before his witnesses could be brought, the mob arrived at the\r\nGovernor\'s mansion and demanded the prisoner. He was given up, and\r\nalthough the white woman in the case said he was not the man, he was\r\nhanged twenty-four hours after, and over a thousand bullets fired into his\r\nbody, on the declaration that "a crime had been committed and someone had\r\nto hang for it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF SOME CASES OF RAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that the Southern white women have been slandered\r\nbecause, in defending the Negro race from the charge that all colored men,\r\nwho are lynched, only pay penalty for assaulting women. It is certain that\r\nlynching mobs have not only refused to give the Negro a chance to defend\r\nhimself, but have killed their victim with a full knowledge that the\r\nrelationship of the alleged assailant with the woman who accused him, was\r\nvoluntary and clandestine. As a matter of fact, one of the prime causes of\r\nthe Lynch Law agitation has been a necessity for defending the Negro from\r\nthis awful charge against him. This defense has been necessary because the\r\napologists for outlawry insist that in no case has the accusing woman been\r\na willing consort of her paramour, who is lynched because overtaken in\r\nwrong. It is well known, however, that such is the case. In July of this\r\nyear, 1894, John Paul Bocock, a Southern white man living in New York, and\r\nassistant editor of the _New York Tribune_, took occasion to defy the\r\npublication of any instance where the lynched Negro was the victim of a\r\nwhite woman\'s falsehood. Such cases are not rare, but the press and people\r\nconversant with the facts, almost invariably suppress them.\r\n\r\nThe _New York Sun_ of July 30,1894, contained a synopsis of interviews\r\nwith leading congressmen and editors of the South. Speaker Crisp, of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, who was recently a Judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nGeorgia, led in declaring that lynching seldom or never took place, save\r\nfor vile crime against women and children. Dr. Hass, editor of the leading\r\norgan of the Methodist Church South, published in its columns that it was\r\nhis belief that more than three hundred women had been assaulted by Negro\r\nmen within three months. When asked to prove his charges, or give a single\r\ncase upon which his "belief" was founded, he said that he could do so, but\r\nthe details were unfit for publication. No other evidence but his "belief"\r\ncould be adduced to substantiate this grave charge, yet Bishop Haygood, in\r\nthe _Forum_ of October, 1893, quotes this "belief" in apology for\r\nlynching, and voluntarily adds: "It is my opinion that this is an\r\nunderestimate." The "opinion" of this man, based upon a "belief," had\r\ngreater weight coming from a man who has posed as a friend to "Our Brother\r\nin Black," and was accepted as authority. An interview of Miss Frances E.\r\nWillard, the great apostle of temperance, the daughter of abolitionists\r\nand a personal friend and helper of many individual colored people, has\r\nbeen quoted in support of the utterance of this calumny against a weak and\r\ndefenseless race. In the _New York Voice_ of October 23, 1890, after a\r\ntour in the South, where she was told all these things by the "best white\r\npeople," she said: "The grogshop is the Negro\'s center of power. Better\r\nwhisky and more of it is the rallying cry of great, dark-faced mobs. The\r\ncolored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grogshop is its\r\ncenter of power. The safety of woman, of childhood, the home, is menaced\r\nin a thousand localities at this moment, so that men dare not go beyond\r\nthe sight of their own roof-tree."\r\n\r\nThese charges so often reiterated, have had the effect of fastening the\r\nodium upon the race of a peculiar propensity for this foul crime. The\r\nNegro is thus forced to a defense of his good name, and this chapter will\r\nbe devoted to the history of some of the cases where assault upon white\r\nwomen by Negroes is charged. He is not the aggressor in this fight, but\r\nthe situation demands that the facts be given, and they will speak for\r\nthemselves. Of the 1,115 Negro men, women and children hanged, shot and\r\nroasted alive from January 1, 1882, to January 1, 1894, inclusive, only\r\n348 of that number were charged with rape. Nearly 700 of these persons\r\nwere lynched for any other reason which could be manufactured by a mob\r\nwishing to indulge in a lynching bee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WHITE WOMAN\'S FALSEHOOD\r\n\r\nThe _Cleveland, Ohio, Gazette_, January 16, 1892, gives an account of one\r\nof these cases of "rape."\r\n\r\nMrs. J.C. Underwood, the wife of a minister of Elyria, Ohio, accused an\r\nAfro-American of rape. She told her husband that during his absence in\r\n1888, stumping the state for the Prohibition Party, the man came to the\r\nkitchen door, forced his way in the house and insulted her. She tried to\r\ndrive him out with a heavy poker, but he overpowered and chloroformed her,\r\nand when she revived her clothing was torn and she was in a horrible\r\ncondition. She did not know the man, but could identify him. She\r\nsubsequently pointed out William Offett, a married man, who was arrested,\r\nand, being in Ohio, was granted a trial.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner vehemently denied the charge of rape, but confessed he went\r\nto Mrs. Underwood\'s residence at her invitation and was criminally\r\nintimate with her at her request. This availed him nothing against the\r\nsworn testimony of a minister\'s wife, a lady of the highest\r\nrespectability. He was found guilty, and entered the penitentiary,\r\nDecember 14, 1888, for fifteen years. Sometime afterwards the woman\'s\r\nremorse led her to confess to her husband that the man was innocent. These\r\nare her words: "I met Offett at the postoffice. It was raining. He was\r\npolite to me, and as I had several bundles in my arms he offered to carry\r\nthem home for me, which he did. He had a strange fascination for me, and I\r\ninvited him to call on me. He called, bringing chestnuts and candy for the\r\nchildren. By this means we got them to leave us alone in the room. Then I\r\nsat on his lap. He made a proposal to me and I readily consented. Why I\r\ndid so I do not know, but that I did is true. He visited me several times\r\nafter that and each time I was indiscreet. I did not care after the first\r\ntime. In fact I could not have resisted, and had no desire to resist."\r\n\r\nWhen asked by her husband why she told him she had been outraged, she\r\nsaid: "I had several reasons for telling you. One was the neighbors saw\r\nthe fellow here, another was, I was afraid I had contracted a loathsome\r\ndisease, and still another was that I feared I might give birth to a Negro\r\nbaby. I hoped to save my reputation by telling you a deliberate lie." Her\r\nhusband, horrified by the confession, had Offett, who had already served\r\nfour years, released and secured a divorce.\r\n\r\nThere have been many such cases throughout the South, with the difference\r\nthat the Southern white men in insensate fury wreak their vengeance\r\nwithout intervention of law upon the Negro who consorts with their women.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIED TO MANUFACTURE AN OUTRAGE\r\n\r\nThe _Memphis (Tenn.) Ledger_, of June 8, 1892, has the following:\r\n\r\n  If Lillie Bailey, a rather pretty white girl, seventeen years of age,\r\n  who is now at the city hospital, would be somewhat less reserved about\r\n  her disgrace there would be some very nauseating details in the story of\r\n  her life. She is the mother of a little coon. The truth might reveal\r\n  fearful depravity or the evidence of a rank outrage. She will not\r\n  divulge the name of the man who has left such black evidence of her\r\n  disgrace, and in fact says it is a matter in which there can be no\r\n  interest to the outside world. She came to Memphis nearly three months\r\n  ago, and was taken in at the Woman\'s Refuge in the southern part of the\r\n  city. She remained there until a few weeks ago when the child was born.\r\n  The ladies in charge of the Refuge were horrified. The girl was at once\r\n  sent to the city hospital, where she has been since May 30. She is a\r\n  country girl. She came to Memphis from her father\'s farm, a short\r\n  distance from Hernando, Miss. Just when she left there she would not\r\n  say. In fact she says she came to Memphis from Arkansas, and says her\r\n  home is in that state. She is rather good looking, has blue eyes, a low\r\n  forehead and dark red hair. The ladies at the Woman\'s Refuge do not know\r\n  anything about the girl further than what they learned when she was an\r\n  inmate of the institution; and she would not tell much. When the child\r\n  was born an attempt was made to get the girl to reveal the name of the\r\n  Negro who had disgraced her, she obstinately refused and it was\r\n  impossible to elicit any information from her on the subject.\r\n\r\nNote the wording: "The truth might reveal fearful depravity or rank\r\noutrage." If it had been a white child or if Lillie Bailey had told a\r\npitiful story of Negro outrage, it would have been a case of woman\'s\r\nweakness or assault and she could have remained at the Woman\'s Refuge. But\r\na Negro child and to withhold its father\'s name and thus prevent the\r\nkilling of another Negro "rapist" was a case of "fearful depravity." Had\r\nshe revealed the father\'s name, he would have been lynched and his taking\r\noff charged to an assault upon a white woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNED ALIVE FOR ADULTERY\r\n\r\nIn Texarkana, Arkansas, Edward Coy was accused of assaulting a white\r\nwoman. The press dispatches of February 18, 1892, told in detail how he\r\nwas tied to a tree, the flesh cut from his body by men and boys, and after\r\ncoal oil was poured over him, the woman he had assaulted gladly set fire\r\nto him, and 15,000 persons saw him burn to death. October 1, the _Chicago\r\nInter Ocean_ contained the following account of that horror from the pen\r\nof the "Bystander" Judge Albion W. Tourgee--as the result of his\r\ninvestigations:\r\n\r\n  1. The woman who was paraded as victim of violence was of bad character;\r\n  her husband was a drunkard and a gambler.\r\n\r\n  2. She was publicly reported and generally known to have been criminally\r\n  intimate with Coy for more than a year previous.\r\n\r\n  3. She was compelled by threats, if not by violence, to make the charge\r\n  against the victim.\r\n\r\n  4. When she came to apply the match Coy asked her if she would burn him\r\n  after they had "been sweethearting" so long.\r\n\r\n  5. A large majority of the "superior" white men prominent in the affair\r\n  are the reputed fathers of mulatto children.\r\n\r\n  These are not pleasant facts, but they are illustrative of the vital\r\n  phase of the so-called race question, which should properly be\r\n  designated an earnest inquiry as to the best methods by which religion,\r\n  science, law and political power may be employed to excuse injustice,\r\n  barbarity and crime done to a people because of race and color. There\r\n  can be no possible belief that these people were inspired by any\r\n  consuming zeal to vindicate God\'s law against miscegenationists of the\r\n  most practical sort. The woman was a willing partner in the victim\'s\r\n  guilt, and being of the "superior" race must naturally have been more\r\n  guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT IDENTIFIED BUT LYNCHED\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 1893, there occurred in Shelby County, Tennessee, the fourth\r\nNegro lynching within fifteen months. The three first were lynched in the\r\ncity of Memphis for firing on white men in self-defense. This Negro,\r\nRichard Neal, was lynched a few miles from the city limits, and the\r\nfollowing is taken from the _Memphis (Tenn.) Scimitar_:\r\n\r\n  As the _Scimitar_ stated on Saturday the Negro, Richard Neal, who raped\r\n  Mrs. Jack White near Forest Hill, in this county, was lynched by a mob\r\n  of about 200 white citizens of the neighborhood. Sheriff McLendon,\r\n  accompanied by Deputies Perkins, App and Harvey and a _Scimitar_\r\n  reporter, arrived on the scene of the execution about 3:30 in the\r\n  afternoon. The body was suspended from the first limb of a post oak tree\r\n  by a new quarter-inch grass rope. A hangman\'s knot, evidently tied by an\r\n  expert, fitted snugly under the left ear of the corpse, and a new hame\r\n  string pinioned the victim\'s arms behind him. His legs were not tied.\r\n  The body was perfectly limber when the Sheriff\'s posse cut it down and\r\n  retained enough heat to warm the feet of Deputy Perkins, whose road cart\r\n  was converted into a hearse. On arriving with the body at Forest Hill\r\n  the Sheriff made a bargain with a stalwart young man with a blonde\r\n  mustache and deep blue eyes, who told the _Scimitar_ reporter that he\r\n  was the leader of the mob, to haul the body to Germantown for $3.\r\n\r\n  When within half-a-mile of Germantown the Sheriff and posse were\r\n  overtaken by Squire McDonald of Collierville, who had come down to hold\r\n  the inquest. The Squire had his jury with him, and it was agreed for the\r\n  convenience of all parties that he should proceed with the corpse to\r\n  Germantown and conduct the inquiry as to the cause of death. He did so,\r\n  and a verdict of death from hanging by parties unknown was returned in\r\n  due form.\r\n\r\n  The execution of Neal was done deliberately and by the best people of\r\n  the Collierville, Germantown and Forest Hill neighborhoods, without\r\n  passion or exhibition of anger.\r\n\r\n  He was arrested on Friday about ten o\'clock, by Constable Bob Cash, who\r\n  carried him before Mrs. White. She said: "I think he is the man. I am\r\n  almost certain of it. If he isn\'t the man he is exactly like him."\r\n\r\n  The Negro\'s coat was torn also, and there were other circumstances\r\n  against him. The committee returned and made its report, and the\r\n  chairman put the question of guilt or innocence to a vote.\r\n\r\n  All who thought the proof strong enough to warrant execution were\r\n  invited to cross over to the other side of the road. Everybody but four\r\n  or five negroes crossed over.\r\n\r\n  The committee then placed Neal on a mule with his arms tied behind him,\r\n  and proceeded to the scene of the crime, followed by the mob. The rope,\r\n  with a noose already prepared, was tied to the limb nearest the spot\r\n  where the unpardonable sin was committed, and the doomed man\'s mule was\r\n  brought to a standstill beneath it.\r\n\r\n  Then Neal confessed. He said he was the right man, but denied that he\r\n  used force or threats to accomplish his purpose. It was a matter of\r\n  purchase, he claimed, and said the price paid was twenty-five cents. He\r\n  warned the colored men present to beware of white women and resist\r\n  temptation, for to yield to their blandishments or to the passions of\r\n  men, meant death.\r\n\r\n  While he was speaking, Mrs. White came from her home and calling\r\n  Constable Cash to one side, asked if he could not save the Negro\'s life.\r\n  The reply was, "No," and Mrs. White returned to the house.\r\n\r\n  When all was in readiness, the husband of Neal\'s victim leaped upon the\r\n  mule\'s back and adjusted the rope around the Negro\'s neck. No cap was\r\n  used, and Neal showed no fear, nor did he beg for mercy. The mule was\r\n  struck with a whip and bounded out from under Neal, leaving him\r\n  suspended in the air with his feet about three feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERED TO THE MOB BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE\r\n\r\nJohn Peterson, near Denmark, S.C., was suspected of rape, but escaped,\r\nwent to Columbia, and placed himself under Gov. Tillman\'s protection,\r\ndeclaring he too could prove an alibi by white witnesses. A white reporter\r\nhearing his declaration volunteered to find these witnesses, and\r\ntelegraphed the governor that he would be in Columbia with them on Monday.\r\nIn the meantime the mob at Denmark, learning Peterson\'s whereabouts, went\r\nto the governor and demanded the prisoner. Gov. Tillman, who had during\r\nhis canvass for reelection the year before, declared that he would lead a\r\nmob to lynch a Negro that assaulted a white woman, gave Peterson up to the\r\nmob. He was taken back to Denmark, and the white girl in the case as\r\npositively declared that he was not the man. But the verdict of the mob\r\nwas that "the crime had been committed and somebody had to hang for it,\r\nand if he, Peterson, was not guilty of that he was of some other crime,"\r\nand he was hung, and his body riddled with 1,000 bullets.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNCHED AS A WARNING\r\n\r\nAlabama furnishes a case in point. A colored man named Daniel Edwards,\r\nlived near Selma, Alabama, and worked for a family of a farmer near that\r\nplace. This resulted in an intimacy between the young man and a daughter\r\nof the householder, which finally developed in the disgrace of the girl.\r\nAfter the birth of the child, the mother disclosed the fact that Edwards\r\nwas its father. The relationship had been sustained for more than a year,\r\nand yet this colored man was apprehended, thrown into jail from whence he\r\nwas taken by a mob of one hundred neighbors and hung to a tree and his\r\nbody riddled with bullets. A dispatch which describes the lynching, ends\r\nas follows. "Upon his back was found pinned this morning the following:\r\n\'Warning to all Negroes that are too intimate with white girls. This the\r\nwork of one hundred best citizens of the South Side.\'"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt from the announcement made by this "one hundred best\r\ncitizens" that they understood full well the character of the relationship\r\nwhich existed between Edwards and the girl, but when the dispatches were\r\nsent out, describing the affair, it was claimed that Edwards was lynched\r\nfor rape.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPRESSING THE TRUTH\r\n\r\nIn a county in Mississippi during the month of July the Associated Press\r\ndispatches sent out a report that the sheriff\'s eight-year-old daughter\r\nhad been assaulted by a big, black, burly brute who had been promptly\r\nlynched. The facts which have since been investigated show that the girl\r\nwas more than eighteen years old and that she was discovered by her father\r\nin this young man\'s room who was a servant on the place. But these facts\r\nthe Associated Press has not given to the world, nor did the same agency\r\nacquaint the world with the fact that a Negro youth who was lynched in\r\nTuscumbia, Ala., the same year on the same charge told the white girl who\r\naccused him before the mob, that he had met her in the woods often by\r\nappointment. There is a young mulatto in one of the State prisons of the\r\nSouth today who is there by charge of a young white woman to screen\r\nherself. He is a college graduate and had been corresponding with, and\r\nclandestinely visiting her until he was surprised and run out of her room\r\nen deshabille by her father. He was put in prison in another town to save\r\nhis life from the mob and his lawyer advised that it were better to save\r\nhis life by pleading guilty to charges made and being sentenced for years,\r\nthan to attempt a defense by exhibiting the letters written him by this\r\ngirl. In the latter event, the mob would surely murder him, while there\r\nwas a chance for his life by adopting the former course. Names, places and\r\ndates are not given for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe excuse has come to be so safe, it is not surprising that a\r\nPhiladelphia girl, beautiful and well educated, and of good family, should\r\nmake a confession published in all the daily papers of that city October,\r\n1894, that she had been stealing for some time, and that to cover one of\r\nher thefts, she had said she had been bound and gagged in her father\'s\r\nhouse by a colored man, and money stolen therefrom by him. Had this been\r\ndone in many localities, it would only have been necessary for her to\r\n"identify" the first Negro in that vicinity, to have brought about another\r\nlynching bee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VILE SLANDER WITH SCANT RETRACTION\r\n\r\nThe following published in the _Cleveland (Ohio) Leader_ of Oct. 23, 1894,\r\nonly emphasizes our demand that a fair trial shall be given those accused\r\nof crime, and the protection of the law be extended until time for a\r\ndefense be granted.\r\n\r\n  The sensational story sent out last night from Hicksville that a Negro\r\n  had outraged a little four-year-old girl proves to be a base canard. The\r\n  correspondents who went into the details should have taken the pains to\r\n  investigate, and the officials should have known more of the matter\r\n  before they gave out such grossly exaggerated information.\r\n\r\n  The Negro, Charles O\'Neil, had been working for a couple of women and,\r\n  it seems, had worked all winter without being remunerated. There is a\r\n  little girl, and the girl\'s mother and grandmother evidently started the\r\n  story with idea of frightening the Negro out of the country and thus\r\n  balancing accounts. The town was considerably wrought up and for a time\r\n  things looked serious. The accused had a preliminary hearing today and\r\n  not an iota of evidence was produced to indicate that such a crime had\r\n  been committed, or that he had even attempted such an outrage. The\r\n  village marshal was frightened nearly out of his wits and did little to\r\n  quiet the excitement last night.\r\n\r\n  The affair was an outrage on the Negro, at the expense of innocent\r\n  childhood, a brainless fabrication from start to finish.\r\n\r\nThe original story was sent throughout this country and England, but the\r\n_Cleveland Leader_, so far as known, is the only journal which has\r\npublished these facts in refutation of the slander so often published\r\nagainst the race. Not only is it true that many of the alleged cases of\r\nrape against the Negro, are like the foregoing, but the same crime\r\ncommitted by white men against Negro women and girls, is never punished by\r\nmob or the law. A leading journal in South Carolina openly said some\r\nmonths ago that "it is not the same thing for a white man to assault a\r\ncolored woman as for a colored man to assault a white woman, because the\r\ncolored woman had no finer feelings nor virtue to be outraged!" Yet\r\ncolored women have always had far more reason to complain of white men in\r\nthis respect than ever white women have had of Negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLINOIS HAS A LYNCHING\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1893, the proud commonwealth of Illinois joined the\r\nranks of Lynching States. Illinois, which gave to the world the immortal\r\nheroes, Lincoln, Grant and Logan, trailed its banner of justice in the\r\ndust--dyed its hands red in the blood of a man not proven guilty of crime.\r\n\r\nJune 3,1893, the country about Decatur, one of the largest cities of the\r\nstate was startled with the cry that a white woman had been assaulted by a\r\ncolored tramp. Three days later a colored man named Samuel Bush was\r\narrested and put in jail. A white man testified that Bush, on the day of\r\nthe assault, asked him where he could get a drink and he pointed to the\r\nhouse where the farmer\'s wife was subsequently said to have been\r\nassaulted. Bush said he went to the well but did not go near the house,\r\nand did not assault the woman. After he was arrested the alleged victim\r\ndid not see him to identify him--he was presumed to be guilty.\r\n\r\nThe citizens determined to kill him. The mob gathered, went to the jail,\r\nmet with no resistance, took the suspected man, dragged him out tearing\r\nevery stitch of clothing from his body, then hanged him to a telegraph\r\npole. The grand jury refused to indict the lynchers though the names of\r\nover twenty persons who were leaders in the mob were well known. In fact\r\ntwenty-two persons were indicted, but the grand jurors and the prosecuting\r\nattorney disagreed as to the form of the indictments, which caused the\r\njurors to change their minds. All indictments were reconsidered and the\r\nmatter was dropped. Not one of the dozens of men prominent in that murder\r\nhave suffered a whit more inconvenience for the butchery of that man, than\r\nthey would have suffered for shooting a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOR LINE JUSTICE\r\n\r\nIn Baltimore, Maryland, a gang of white ruffians assaulted a respectable\r\ncolored girl who was out walking with a young man of her own race. They\r\nheld her escort and outraged the girl. It was a deed dastardly enough to\r\narouse Southern blood, which gives its horror of rape as excuse for\r\nlawlessness, but she was a colored woman. The case went to the courts and\r\nthey were acquitted.\r\n\r\nIn Nashville, Tennessee, there was a white man, Pat Hanifan, who outraged\r\na little colored girl, and from the physical injuries received she was\r\nruined for life. He was jailed for six months, discharged, and is now a\r\ndetective in that city. In the same city, last May, a white man outraged a\r\ncolored girl in a drug store. He was arrested and released on bail at the\r\ntrial. It was rumored that five hundred colored men had organized to lynch\r\nhim. Two hundred and fifty white citizens armed themselves with\r\nWinchesters and guarded him. A cannon was placed in front of his home, and\r\nthe Buchanan Rifles (State Militia) ordered to the scene for his\r\nprotection. The colored mob did not show up. Only two weeks before, Eph.\r\nGrizzard, who had only been charged with rape upon a white woman, had been\r\ntaken from the jail, with Governor Buchanan and the police and militia\r\nstanding by, dragged through the streets in broad daylight, knives plunged\r\ninto him at every step, and with every fiendish cruelty that a frenzied\r\nmob could devise, he was at last swung out on the bridge with hands cut to\r\npieces as he tried to climb up the stanchions. A naked, bloody example of\r\nthe bloodthirstiness of the nineteenth-century civilization of the Athens\r\nof the South! No cannon nor military were called out in his defense. He\r\ndared to visit a white woman.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when these civilized whites were announcing their\r\ndetermination "to protect their wives and daughters," by murdering\r\nGrizzard, a white man was in the same jail for raping eight-year-old\r\nMaggie Reese, a colored girl. He was not harmed. The "honor" of grown\r\nwomen who were glad enough to be supported by the Grizzard boys and Ed.\r\nCoy, as long as the liaison was not known, needed protection; they were\r\nwhite. The outrage upon helpless childhood needed no avenging in this\r\ncase; she was black.\r\n\r\nA white man in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory, two months after inflicted\r\nsuch injuries upon another colored girl that she died. He was not\r\npunished, but an attempt was made in the same town in the month of June to\r\nlynch a colored man who visited a white woman.\r\n\r\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, in the month of June, Ellerton L. Dorr, who is the\r\nhusband of Russell Hancock\'s widow, was arrested for attempted rape on\r\nMattie Cole, a neighbor\'s cook; he was only prevented from accomplishing\r\nhis purpose by the appearance of Mattie\'s employer. Dorr\'s friends say he\r\nwas drunk and, not responsible for his actions. The grand jury refused to\r\nindict him and he was discharged.\r\n\r\nIn Tallahassee, Florida, a colored girl, Charlotte Gilliam, was assaulted\r\nby white men. Her father went to have a warrant for their arrest issued,\r\nbut the judge refused to issue it.\r\n\r\nIn Bowling Green, Virginia, Moses Christopher, a colored lad, was charged\r\nwith assault, September 10. He was indicted, tried, convicted and\r\nsentenced to death in one day. In the same state at Danville, two weeks\r\nbefore--August 29, Thomas J. Penn, a white man, committed a criminal\r\nassault upon Lina Hanna, a twelve-year-old colored girl, but he has not\r\nbeen tried, certainly not killed either by the law or the mob.\r\n\r\nIn Surrey county, Virginia, C.L. Brock, a white man, criminally assaulted\r\na ten-year-old colored girl, and threatened to kill her if she told.\r\nNotwithstanding, she confessed to her aunt, Mrs. Alice Bates, and the\r\nwhite brute added further crime by killing Mrs. Bates when she upbraided\r\nhim about his crime upon her niece. He emptied the contents of his\r\nrevolver into her body as she lay. Brock has never been apprehended, and\r\nno effort has been made to do so by the legal authorities.\r\n\r\nBut even when punishment is meted out by law to white villians for this\r\nhorrible crime, it is seldom or never that capital punishment is invoked.\r\nTwo cases just clipped from the daily papers will suffice to show how this\r\ncrime is punished when committed by white offenders and black.\r\n\r\nLOUISVILLE, KY., October 19.--Smith Young, colored, was today sentenced to\r\nbe hanged. Young criminally assaulted a six-year-old child about six\r\nmonths ago.\r\n\r\nJacques Blucher, the Pontiac Frenchman who was arrested at that place for\r\na criminal assault on his daughter Fanny on July 29 last, pleaded nolo\r\ncontendere when placed on trial at East Greenwich, near Providence, R.I.,\r\nTuesday, and was sentenced to five years in State Prison.\r\n\r\nCharles Wilson was convicted of assault upon seven-year-old Mamie Keys in\r\nPhiladelphia, in October, and sentenced to ten years in prison. He was\r\nwhite. Indianapolis courts sentenced a white man in September to eight\r\nyears in prison for assault upon a twelve-year-old white girl.\r\n\r\nApril 24, 1893, a lynching was set for Denmark, S.C., on the charge of\r\nrape. A white girl accused a Negro of assault, and the mob was about to\r\nlynch him. A few hours before the lynching three reputable white men rode\r\ninto the town and solemnly testified that the accused Negro was at work\r\nwith them 25 miles away on the day and at the hour the crime had been\r\ncommitted. He was accordingly set free. A white person\'s word is taken as\r\nabsolutely for as against a Negro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSADE JUSTIFIED\r\n\r\n_(Appeal from America to the World_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been urged in criticism of the movement appealing to the English\r\npeople for sympathy and support in our crusade against Lynch Law that our\r\naction was unpatriotic, vindictive and useless. It is not a part of the\r\nplan of this pamphlet to make any defense for that crusade nor to indict\r\nany apology for the motives which led to the presentation of the facts of\r\nAmerican lynchings to the world at large. To those who are not willfully\r\nblind and unjustly critical, the record of more than a thousand lynchings\r\nin ten years is enough to justify any peaceable movement tending to\r\nameliorate the conditions which led to this unprecedented slaughter of\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nIf America would not hear the cry of men, women and children whose dying\r\ngroans ascended to heaven praying for relief, not only for them but for\r\nothers who might soon be treated as they, then certainly no fair-minded\r\nperson can charge disloyalty to those who make an appeal to the\r\ncivilization of the world for such sympathy and help as it is possible to\r\nextend. If stating the facts of these lynchings, as they appeared from\r\ntime to time in the white newspapers of America--the news gathered by\r\nwhite correspondents, compiled by white press bureaus and disseminated\r\namong white people--shows any vindictiveness, then the mind which so\r\ncharges is not amenable to argument.\r\n\r\nBut it is the desire of this pamphlet to urge that the crusade started and\r\nthus far continued has not been useless, but has been blessed with the\r\nmost salutary results. The many evidences of the good results can not here\r\nbe mentioned, but the thoughtful student of the situation can himself\r\nfind ample proof. There need not here be mentioned the fact that for the\r\nfirst time since lynching began, has there been any occasion for the\r\ngovernors of the several states to speak out in reference to these crimes\r\nagainst law and order.\r\n\r\nNo matter how heinous the act of the lynchers may have been, it was\r\ndiscussed only for a day or so and then dismissed from the attention of\r\nthe public. In one or two instances the governor has called attention to\r\nthe crime, but the civil processes entirely failed to bring the murderers\r\nto justice. Since the crusade against lynching was started, however,\r\ngovernors of states, newspapers, senators and representatives and bishops\r\nof churches have all been compelled to take cognizance of the prevalence\r\nof this crime and to speak in one way or another in the defense of the\r\ncharge against this barbarism in the United States. This has not been\r\nbecause there was any latent spirit of justice voluntarily asserting\r\nitself, especially in those who do the lynching, but because the entire\r\nAmerican people now feel, both North and South, that they are objects in\r\nthe gaze of the civilized world and that for every lynching humanity asks\r\nthat America render its account to civilization and itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nAWFUL BARBARISM IGNORED\r\n\r\nMuch has been said during the months of September and October of 1894\r\nabout the lynching of six colered men who on suspicion of incendiarism\r\nwere made the victims of a most barbarous massacre.\r\n\r\nThey were arrested, one by one, by officers of the law; they were\r\nhandcuffed and chained together and by the officers of the law loaded in a\r\nwagon and deliberately driven into an ambush where a mob of lynchers\r\nawaited them. At the time and upon the chosen spot, in the darkness of the\r\nnight and far removed from the habitation of any human soul, the wagon was\r\nhalted and the mob fired upon the six manacled men, shooting them to death\r\nas no humane person would have shot dogs. Chained together as they were,\r\nin their awful struggles after the first volley, the victims tumbled out\r\nof the wagon upon the ground and there in the mud, struggling in their\r\ndeath throes, the victims were made the target of the murderous shotguns,\r\nwhich fired into the writhing, struggling, dying mass of humanity, until\r\nevery spark of life was gone. Then the officers of the law who had them in\r\ncharge, drove away to give the alarm and to tell the world that they had\r\nbeen waylaid and their prisoners forcibly taken from them and killed.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that the prompt, vigorous and highly commendable steps\r\nof the governor of the State of Tennessee and the judge having\r\njurisdiction over the crime, and of the citizens of Memphis generally, was\r\nthe natural revolt of the humane conscience in that section of the\r\ncountry, and the determination of honest and honorable men to rid the\r\ncommunity of such men as those who were guilty of this terrible massacre.\r\nIt has further been claimed that this vigorous uprising of the people and\r\nthis most commendably prompt action of the civil authorities, is ample\r\nproof that the American people will not tolerate the lynching of innocent\r\nmen, and that in cases where brutal lynchings have not been promptly dealt\r\nwith, the crimes on the part of the victims were such as to put them\r\noutside the pale of humanity and that the world considered their death a\r\nnecessary sacrifice for the good of all.\r\n\r\nBut this line of argument can in no possible way be truthfully sustained.\r\nThe lynching of the six men in 1894, barbarous as it was, was in no way\r\nmore barbarous than took nothing more than a passing notice. It was only\r\nthe other lynchings which preceded it, and of which the public fact that\r\nthe attention of the civilized world has been called to lynching in\r\nAmerica which made the people of Tennessee feel the absolute necessity for\r\na prompt, vigorous and just arraignment of all the murderers connected\r\nwith that crime. Lynching is no longer "Our Problem," it is the problem of\r\nthe civilized world, and Tennessee could not afford to refuse the legal\r\nmeasures which Christianity demands shall be used for the punishment of\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMPHIS THEN AND NOW\r\n\r\nOnly two years prior to the massacre of the six men near Memphis, that\r\nsame city took part in a massacre in every way as bloody and brutal as\r\nthat of September last. It was the murder of three young colored men and\r\nwho were known to be among the most honorable, reliable, worthy and\r\npeaceable colored citizens of the community. All of them were engaged in\r\nthe mercantile business, being members of a corporation which conducted a\r\nlarge grocery store, and one of the three being a letter carrier in the\r\nemploy of the government. These three men were arrested for resisting an\r\nattack of a mob upon their store, in which melee none of the assailants,\r\nwho had armed themselves for their devilish deeds by securing court\r\nprocesses, were killed or even seriously injured. But these three men were\r\nput in jail, and on three or four nights after their incarceration a mob\r\nof less than a dozen men, by collusion with the civil authorities, entered\r\nthe jail, took the three men from the custody of the law and shot them to\r\ndeath. Memphis knew of this awful crime, knew then and knows today who the\r\nmen were who committed it, and yet not the first step was ever taken to\r\napprehend the guilty wretches who walk the streets today with the brand of\r\nmurder upon their foreheads, but as safe from harm as the most upright\r\ncitizen of that community. Memphis would have been just as calm and\r\ncomplacent and self-satisfied over the murder of the six colored men in\r\n1894 as it was over these three colored men in 1892, had it not recognized\r\nthe fact that to escape the brand of barbarism it had not only to speak\r\nits denunciation but to act vigorously in vindication of its name.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ALABAMA HORROR IGNORED\r\n\r\nA further instance of this absolute disregard of every principle of\r\njustice and the indifference to the barbarism of Lynch Law may be cited\r\nhere, and is furnished by white residents in the city of Carrolton,\r\nAlabama. Several cases of arson had been discovered, and in their search\r\nfor the guilty parties, suspicion was found to rest upon three men and a\r\nwoman. The four suspects were Paul Hill, Paul Archer, William Archer, his\r\nbrother, and a woman named Emma Fair. The prisoners were apprehended,\r\nearnestly asserted their innocence, but went to jail without making any\r\nresistance. They claimed that they could easily prove their innocence upon\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nOne would suspect that the civilization which defends itself against the\r\nbarbarisms of Lynch Law by stating that it lynches human beings only when\r\nthey are guilty of awful attacks upon women and children, would have been\r\nvery careful to have given these four prisoners, who were simply charged\r\nwith arson, a fair trial, to which they were entitled upon every principle\r\nof law and humanity. Especially would this seem to be the case when if is\r\nconsidered that one of the prisoners charged was a woman, and if the\r\nnineteenth century has shown any advancement upon any lines of human\r\naction, it is preeminently shown in its reverence, respect and protection\r\nof its womanhood. But the people of Alabama failed to have any regard for\r\nwomanhood whatever.\r\n\r\nThe three men and the woman were put in jail to await trial. A few days\r\nlater it was rumored that they were to be subjects of Lynch Law, and, sure\r\nenough, at night a mob of lynchers went to the jail, not to avenge any\r\nawful crime against womanhood, but to kill four people who had been\r\nsuspected of setting a house on fire. They were caged in their cells,\r\nhelpless and defenseless; they were at the mercy of civilized white\r\nAmericans, who, armed with shotguns, were there to maintain the majesty of\r\nAmerican law. And most effectively was their duty done by these splendid\r\nrepresentatives of Governor Fishback\'s brave and honorable white\r\nsoutherners, who resent "outside interference." They lined themselves up\r\nin the most effective manner and poured volley after volley into the\r\nbodies of their helpless, pleading victims, who in their bolted prison\r\ncells could do nothing but suffer and die. Then these lynchers went\r\nquietly away and the bodies of the woman and three men were taken out and\r\nburied with as little ceremony as men would bury hogs.\r\n\r\nNo one will say that the massacre near Memphis in 1894 was any worse than\r\nthis bloody crime of Alabama in 1892. The details of this shocking affair\r\nwere given to the public by the press, but public sentiment was not moved\r\nto action in the least; it was only a matter of a day\'s notice and then\r\nwent to swell the list of murders which stand charged against the noble,\r\nChristian people of Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA AWAKENED\r\n\r\nBut there is now an awakened conscience throughout the land, and Lynch Law\r\ncan not flourish in the future as it has in the past. The close of the\r\nyear 1894 witnessed an aroused interest, an assertative humane principle\r\nwhich must tend to the extirpation of that crime. The awful butchery last\r\nmentioned failed to excite more than a passing comment In 1894, but far\r\ndifferent is it today. Gov. Jones, of Alabama, in 1893 dared to speak out\r\nagainst the rule of the mob in no uncertain terms. His address indicated a\r\nmost helpful result of the present agitation. In face of the many denials\r\nof the outrages on the one hand and apologies for lynchers on the other,\r\nGov. Jones admits the awful lawlessness charged and refuses to join in\r\nthe infamous plea made to condone the crime. No stronger nor more\r\neffective words have been said than those following from Gov. Jones.\r\n\r\n  While the ability of the state to deal with open revolts against the\r\n  supremacy of its laws has been ably demonstrated, I regret that\r\n  deplorable acts of violence have been perpetrated, in at least four\r\n  instances, within the past two years by mobs, whose sudden work and\r\n  quick dispersions rendered it impossible to protect their victims.\r\n  Within the past two years nine prisoners, who were either in jail or in\r\n  the custody of the officers, have been taken from them without\r\n  resistance, and put to death. There was doubt of the guilt of the\r\n  defendants in most of these cases, and few of them were charged with\r\n  capital offenses. None of them involved the crime of rape. The largest\r\n  rewards allowed by law were offered for the apprehension of the\r\n  offenders, and officers were charged to a vigilant performance of their\r\n  duties, and aided in some instances by the services of skilled\r\n  detectives; but not a single arrest has been made and the grand juries\r\n  in these counties have returned no bills of indictment. This would\r\n  indicate either that local public sentiment approved these acts of\r\n  violence or was too weak to punish them, or that the officers charged\r\n  with that duty were in some way lacking in their performance. The evil\r\n  cannot be cured or remedied by silence as to its existence. Unchecked,\r\n  it will continue until it becomes a reproach to our good name, and a\r\n  menace to our prosperity and peace; and it behooves you to exhaust all\r\n  remedies within your power to find better preventives for such crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRIENDLY WARNING\r\n\r\nFrom England comes a friendly voice which must give to every patriotic\r\ncitizen food for earnese thought. Writing from London, to the _Chicago\r\nInter Ocean_, Nov. 25, 1894, the distinguished compiler of our last\r\ncensus, Hon. Robert P. Porter, gives the American people a most\r\ninteresting review of the antilynching crusade in England, submitting\r\neditorial opinions from all sections of England and Scotland, showing the\r\nconsensus of British opinion on this subject. It hardly need be said, that\r\nwithout exception, the current of English thought deprecates the rule of\r\nmob law, and the conscience of England is shocked by the revelation made\r\nduring the present crusade. In his letter Mr. Porter says:\r\n\r\n  While some English journals have joined certain American journals in\r\n  ridiculing the well-meaning people who have formed the antilynching\r\n  committee, there is a deep under current on this subject which is\r\n  injuring the Southern States far more than those who have not been drawn\r\n  into the question of English investment for the South as I have can\r\n  surmise. This feeling is by no means all sentiment. An Englishman whose\r\n  word and active cooperation could send a million sterling to any\r\n  legitimate Southern enterprise said the other day: "I will not invest a\r\n  farthing in States where these horrors occur. I have no particular\r\n  sympathy with the antilynching committee, but such outrages indicate to\r\n  my mind that where life is held to be of such little value there is even\r\n  less assurance that the laws will protect property. As I understand it\r\n  the States, not the national government, control in such matters, and\r\n  where those laws are strongest there is the best field for British\r\n  capital."\r\n\r\nProbably the most bitter attack on the antilynching committee has come\r\nfrom the _London Times_. Those Southern Governors who had their bombastic\r\nletters published in the _Times_, with favorable editorial comment, may\r\nhave had their laugh at the antilynchers here too soon. A few days ago, in\r\ncommenting on an interesting communication from Richard H. Edmonds, editor\r\nof the _Manufacturer\'s Record_, setting forth the industrial advantages of\r\nthe Southern States, which was published in its columns, the _Times_ says:\r\n\r\n  Without in any way countenancing the impertinence of "antilynching"\r\n  committee, we may say that a state of things in which the killing of\r\n  Negroes by bloodthirsty mobs is an incident of not unfrequent occurrence\r\n  is not conducive to success in industry. Its existence, however, is a\r\n  serious obstacle to the success of the South in industry; for even now\r\n  Negro labor, which means at best inefficient labor, must be largely\r\n  relied on there, and its efficiency must be still further diminished by\r\n  spasmodic terrorism.\r\n\r\n  Those interested in the development of the resources of the Southern\r\n  States, and no one in proportion to his means has shown more faith in\r\n  the progress of the South than the writer of this article, must take\r\n  hold of this matter earnestly and intelligently. Sneering at the\r\n  antilynching committee will do no good. Back of them, in fact, if not in\r\n  form, is the public opinion of Great Britain. Even the _Times_ cannot\r\n  deny this. It may not be generally known in the United States, but while\r\n  the Southern and some of the Northern newspapers are making a target of\r\n  Miss Wells, the young colored woman who started this English movement,\r\n  and cracking their jokes at the expense of Miss Florence Balgarnie, who,\r\n  as honorable secretary, conducts the committee\'s correspondence, the\r\n  strongest sort of sentiment is really at the back of the movement. Here\r\n  we have crystallized every phase of political opinion. Extreme Unionists\r\n  like the Duke of Argyll and advanced home rulers such as Justin\r\n  McCarthy; Thomas Burt, the labor leader; Herbert Burrows, the Socialist,\r\n  and Tom Mann, representing all phases of the Labor party, are\r\n  cooperating with conservatives like Sir T. Eldon Gorst. But the real\r\n  strength of this committee is not visible to the casual observer. As a\r\n  matter of fact it represents many of the leading and most powerful\r\n  British journals. A.E. Fletcher is editor of the _London Daily\r\n  Chronicle_; P.W. Clayden is prominent in the counsels of the _London\r\n  Daily News_; Professor James Stuart is Gladstone\'s great friend and\r\n  editor of the _London Star_, William Byles is editor and proprietor of\r\n  the _Bradford Observer_, Sir Hugh Gilzen Reid is a leading Birmingham\r\n  editor; in short, this committee has secured if not the leading editors,\r\n  certainly important and warm friends, representing the Manchester\r\n  Guardian, the _Leeds Mercury_, the _Plymouth Western News, Newcastle\r\n  Leader_, the _London Daily Graphic_, the _Westminster Gazette_, the\r\n  _London Echo_, a host of minor papers all over the kingdom, and\r\n  practically the entire religious press of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n  The greatest victory for the antilynchers comes this morning in the\r\n  publication in the _London Times_ of William Lloyd Garrison\'s letter.\r\n  This letter will have immense effect here. It may have been printed in\r\n  full in the United States, but nevertheless I will quote a paragraph\r\n  which will strengthen the antilynchers greatly in their crusade here:\r\n\r\n  A year ago the South derided and resented Northern protests; today it\r\n  listens, explains and apologizes for its uncovered cruelties. Surely a\r\n  great triumph for a little woman to accomplish! It is the power of truth\r\n  simply and unreservedly spoken, for her language was inadequate to\r\n  describe the horrors exposed.\r\n\r\nIf the Southern states are wise, and I say this with the earnestness of a\r\nfriend and one who has built a home in the mountain regions of the South\r\nand thrown his lot in with them, they will not only listen, but stop\r\nlawlessness of all kinds. If they do, and thus secure the confidence of\r\nEnglishmen, we may in the next decade realize some of the hopes for the\r\nnew South we have so fondly cherished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nMISS WILLARD\'S ATTITUDE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo class of American citizens stands in greater need of the humane and\r\nthoughtful consideration of all sections of our country than do the\r\ncolored people, nor does any class exceed us in the measure of grateful\r\nregard for acts of kindly interest in our behalf. It is, therefore, to us,\r\na matter of keen regret that a Christian organization, so large and\r\ninfluential as the Woman\'s Christian Temperance Union, should refuse to\r\ngive its sympathy and support to our oppressed people who ask no further\r\nfavor than the promotion of public sentiment which shall guarantee to\r\nevery person accused of crime the safeguard of a fair and impartial trial,\r\nand protection from butchery by brutal mobs. Accustomed as we are to the\r\nindifference and apathy of Christian people, we would bear this instance\r\nof ill fortune in silence, had not Miss Willard gone out of her way to\r\nantagonize the cause so dear to our hearts by including in her Annual\r\nAddress to the W.C.T.U. Convention at Cleveland, November 5, 1894, a\r\nstudied, unjust and wholly unwarranted attack upon our work.\r\n\r\nIn her address Miss Willard said:\r\n\r\n  The zeal for her race of Miss Ida B. Wells, a bright young colored\r\n  woman, has, it seems to me, clouded her perception as to who were her\r\n  friends and well-wishers in all high-minded and legitimate efforts to\r\n  banish the abomination of lynching and torture from the land of the free\r\n  and the home of the brave. It is my firm belief that in the statements\r\n  made by Miss Wells concerning white women having taken the initiative\r\n  in nameless acts between the races she has put an imputation upon half\r\n  the white race in this country that is unjust, and, save in the rarest\r\n  exceptional instances, wholly without foundation. This is the unanimous\r\n  opinion of the most disinterested and observant leaders of opinion whom\r\n  I have consulted on the subject, and I do not fear to say that the\r\n  laudable efforts she is making are greatly handicapped by statements of\r\n  this kind, nor to urge her as a friend and well-wisher to banish from\r\n  her vocabulary all such allusions as a source of weakness to the cause\r\n  she has at heart.\r\n\r\nThis paragraph, brief as it is, contains two statements which have not the\r\nslightest foundation in fact. At no time, nor in any place, have I made\r\nstatements "concerning white women having taken the initiative in nameless\r\nacts between the races." Further, at no time, or place nor under any\r\ncircumstance, have I directly or inferentially "put an imputation upon\r\nhalf the white race in this country" and I challenge this "friend and\r\nwell-wisher" to give proof of the truth of her charge. Miss Willard\r\nprotests against lynching in one paragraph and then, in the next,\r\ndeliberately misrepresents my position in order that she may criticise a\r\nmovement, whose only purpose is to protect our oppressed race from\r\nvindictive slander and Lynch Law.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said and what I now repeat--in answer to her first charge--is,\r\nthat colored men have been lynched for assault upon women, when the facts\r\nwere plain that the relationship between the victim lynched and the\r\nalleged victim of his assault was voluntary, clandestine and illicit. For\r\nthat very reason we maintain, that, in every section of our land, the\r\naccused should have a fair, impartial trial, so that a man who is colored\r\nshall not be hanged for an offense, which, if he were white, would not be\r\nadjudged a crime. Facts cited in another chapter--"History of Some Cases\r\nof Rape"--amply maintain this position. The publication of these facts in\r\ndefense of the good name of the race casts no "imputation upon half the\r\nwhite race in this country" and no such imputation can be inferred except\r\nby persons deliberately determined to be unjust.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only injury which this cause has suffered at the hands\r\nof our "friend and well-wisher." It has been said that the Women\'s\r\nChristian Temperance Union, the most powerful organization of women in\r\nAmerica, was misrepresented by me while I was in England. Miss Willard was\r\nin England at the time and knowing that no such misrepresentation came to\r\nher notice, she has permitted that impression to become fixed and\r\nwidespread, when a word from her would have made the facts plain.\r\n\r\nI never at any time or place or in any way misrepresented that\r\norganization. When asked what concerted action had been taken by churches\r\nand great moral agencies in America to put down Lynch Law, I was compelled\r\nin truth to say that no such action had occurred, that pulpit, press and\r\nmoral agencies in the main were silent and for reasons known to\r\nthemselves, ignored the awful conditions which to the English people\r\nappeared so abhorent. Then the question was asked what the great moral\r\nreformers like Miss Frances Willard and Mr. Moody had done to suppress\r\nLynch Law and again I answered nothing. That Mr. Moody had never said a\r\nword against lynching in any of his trips to the South, or in the North\r\neither, so far as was known, and that Miss Willard\'s only public utterance\r\non the situation had condoned lynching and other unjust practices of the\r\nSouth against the Negro. When proof of these statements was demanded, I\r\nsent a letter containing a copy of the _New York Voice_, Oct. 23,1890, in\r\nwhich appeared Miss Willard\'s own words of wholesale slander against the\r\ncolored race and condonation of Southern white people\'s outrages against\r\nus. My letter in part reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  But Miss Willard, the great temperance leader, went even further in\r\n  putting the seal of her approval upon the southerners\' method of dealing\r\n  with the Negro. In October, 1890, the Women\'s Christian Temperance Union\r\n  held its national meeting at Atlanta, Georgia. It was the first time in\r\n  the history of the organization that it had gone south for a national\r\n  meeting, and met the southerners in their own homes. They were welcomed\r\n  with open arms. The governor of the state and the legislature gave\r\n  special audiences in the halls of state legislation to the temperance\r\n  workers. They set out to capture the northerners to their way of seeing\r\n  things, and without troubling to hear the Negro side of the question,\r\n  these temperance people accepted the white man\'s story of the problem\r\n  with which he had to deal. State organizers were appointed that year,\r\n  who had gone through the southern states since then, but in obedience to\r\n  southern prejudices have confined their work to white persons only. It\r\n  is only after Negroes are in prison for crimes that efforts of these\r\n  temperance women are exerted without regard to "race, color, or previous\r\n  condition." No "ounce of prevention" is used in their case; they are\r\n  black, and if these women went among the Negroes for this work, the\r\n  whites would not receive them. Except here and there, are found no\r\n  temperance workers of the Negro race; "the great dark-faced mobs" are\r\n  left the easy prey of the saloonkeepers.\r\n\r\n  There was pending in the National Congress at this time a Federal\r\n  Election Bill, the object being to give the National Government control\r\n  of the national elections in the several states. Had this bill become a\r\n  law, the Negro, whose vote has been systematically suppressed since 1875\r\n  in the southern states, would have had the protection of the National\r\n  Government, and his vote counted. The South would have been no longer\r\n  "solid"; the Southerners saw that the balance of power which they\r\n  unlawfully held in the House of Representatives and the Electoral\r\n  College, based on the Negro population, would be wrested from them. So\r\n  they nick-named the pending elections law the "Force Bill"--probably\r\n  because it would force them to disgorge their ill-gotten political\r\n  gains--and defeated it. While it was being discussed, the question was\r\n  submitted to Miss Willard: "What do you think of the race problem and\r\n  the Force Bill?"\r\n\r\n  Said Miss Willard: "Now, as to the \'race problem\' in its minified,\r\n  current meaning, I am a true lover of the southern people--have spoken\r\n  and worked in, perhaps, 200 of their towns and cities; have been taken\r\n  into their love and confidence at scores of hospitable firesides; have\r\n  heard them pour out their hearts in the splendid frankness of their\r\n  impetuous natures. And I have said to them at such times: \'When I go\r\n  North there will be wafted to you no word from pen or voice that is not\r\n  loyal to what we are saying here and now.\' Going South, a woman, a\r\n  temperance woman, and a Northern temperance woman--three great barriers\r\n  to their good will yonder--I was received by them with a confidence that\r\n  was one of the most delightful surprises of my life. I think we have\r\n  wronged the South, though we did not mean to do so. The reason was, in\r\n  part, that we had irreparably wronged ourselves by putting no safeguards\r\n  on the ballot box at the North that would sift out alien illiterates.\r\n  They rule our cities today; the saloon is their palace, and the toddy\r\n  stick their sceptre. It is not fair that they should vote, nor is it\r\n  fair that a plantation Negro, who can neither read nor write, whose\r\n  ideas are bounded by the fence of his own field and the price of his own\r\n  mule, should be entrusted with the ballot. We ought to have put an\r\n  educational test upon that ballot from the first. The Anglo-Saxon race\r\n  will never submit to be dominated by the Negro so long as his altitude\r\n  reaches no higher than the personal liberty of the saloon, and the power\r\n  of appreciating the amount of liquor that a dollar will buy. New England\r\n  would no more submit to this than South Carolina. \'Better whisky and\r\n  more of it\' has been the rallying cry of great dark-faced mobs in the\r\n  Southern localities where local option was snowed under by the colored\r\n  vote. Temperance has no enemy like that, for it is unreasoning and\r\n  unreasonable. Tonight it promises in a great congregation to vote for\r\n  temperance at the polls tomorrow; but tomorrow twenty-five cents changes\r\n  that vote in favor of the liquor-seller.\r\n\r\n  "I pity the southerners, and I believe the great mass of them are as\r\n  conscientious and kindly intentioned toward the colored man as an equal\r\n  number of white church-members of the North. Would-be demagogues lead\r\n  the colored people to destruction. Half-drunken white roughs murder them\r\n  at the polls, or intimidate them so that they do not vote. But the\r\n  better class of people must not be blamed for this, and a more\r\n  thoroughly American population than the Christian people of the South\r\n  does not exist. They have the traditions, the kindness, the probity, the\r\n  courage of our forefathers. The problem on their hands is immeasurable.\r\n  The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop is\r\n  its center of power. \'The safety of woman, of childhood, of the home, is\r\n  menaced in a thousand localities at this moment, so that the men dare\r\n  not go beyond the sight of their own roof-tree.\' How little we know of\r\n  all this, seated in comfort and affluence here at the North, descanting\r\n  upon the rights of every man to cast one vote and have it fairly\r\n  counted; that well-worn shibboleth invoked once more to dodge a living\r\n  issue.\r\n\r\n  "The fact is that illiterate colored men will not vote at the South\r\n  until the white population chooses to have them do so; and under similar\r\n  conditions they would not at the North." Here we have Miss Willard\'s\r\n  words in full, condoning fraud, violence, murder, at the ballot box;\r\n  rapine, shooting, hanging and burning; for all these things are done and\r\n  being done now by the Southern white people. She does not stop there,\r\n  but goes a step further to aid them in blackening the good name of an\r\n  entire race, as shown by the sentences quoted in the paragraph above.\r\n  These utterances, for which the colored people have never forgiven Miss\r\n  Willard, and which Frederick Douglass has denounced as false, are to be\r\n  found in full in the Voice of October 23,1890, a temperance organ\r\n  published at New York City.\r\n\r\nThis letter appeared in the May number of _Fraternity_, the organ of the\r\nfirst Anti-Lynching society of Great Britain. When Lady Henry Somerset\r\nlearned through Miss Florence Balgarnie that this letter had been\r\npublished she informed me that if the interview was published she would\r\ntake steps to let the public know that my statements must be received with\r\ncaution. As I had no money to pay the printer to suppress the edition\r\nwhich was already published and these ladies did not care to do so, the\r\nMay number of _Fraternity_ was sent to its subscribers as usual. Three\r\ndays later there appeared in the daily _Westminster Gazette_ an\r\n"interview" with Miss Willard, written by Lady Henry Somerset, which was\r\nso subtly unjust in its wording that I was forced to reply in my own\r\ndefense. In that reply I made only statements which, like those concerning\r\nMiss Willard\'s _Voice_ interview, have not been and cannot be denied. It\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n  LADY HENRY SOMERSET\'S INTERVIEW WITH MISS WILLARD\r\n\r\n  To the Editor of the _Westminster Gazette_: Sir--The interview published\r\n  in your columns today hardly merits a reply, because of the indifference\r\n  to suffering manifested. Two ladies are represented sitting under a tree\r\n  at Reigate, and, after some preliminary remarks on the terrible subject\r\n  of lynching, Miss Willard laughingly replies by cracking a joke. And the\r\n  concluding sentence of the interview shows the object is not to\r\n  determine how best they may help the Negro who is being hanged, shot and\r\n  burned, but "to guard Miss Willard\'s reputation."\r\n\r\n  With me it is not myself nor my reputation, but the life of my people,\r\n  which is at stake, and I affirm that this is the first time to my\r\n  knowledge that Miss Willard has said a single word in denunciation of\r\n  lynching or demand for law. The year 1890, the one in which the\r\n  interview appears, had a larger lynching record than any previous year,\r\n  and the number and territory have increased, to say nothing of the human\r\n  beings burnt alive.\r\n\r\n  If so earnest as she would have the English public believe her to be,\r\n  why was she silent when five minutes were given me to speak last June at\r\n  Princes\' Hall, and in Holborn Town Hall this May? I should say it was as\r\n  President of the Women\'s Christian Temperance Union of America she is\r\n  timid, because all these unions in the South emphasize the hatred of the\r\n  Negro by excluding him. There is not a single colored woman admitted to\r\n  the Southern W.C.T.U., but still Miss Willard blames the Negro for the\r\n  defeat of Prohibition in the South. Miss Willard quotes from\r\n  _Fraternity_, but forgets to add my immediate recognition of her\r\n  presence on the platform at Holborn Town Hall, when, amidst many other\r\n  resolutions on temperance and other subjects in which she is interested,\r\n  time was granted to carry an anti-lynching resolution. I was so thankful\r\n  for this crumb of her speechless presence that I hurried off to the\r\n  editor of _Fraternity_ and added a postscript to my article blazoning\r\n  forth that fact.\r\n\r\n  Any statements I have made concerning Miss Willard are confirmed by the\r\n  Hon. Frederick Douglass (late United States minister to Hayti) in a\r\n  speech delivered by him in Washington in January of this year, which has\r\n  since been published in a pamphlet. The fact is, Miss Willard is no\r\n  better or worse than the great bulk of white Americans on the Negro\r\n  questions. They are all afraid to speak out, and it is only British\r\n  public opinion which will move them, as I am thankful to see it has\r\n  already begun to move Miss Willard. I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n  May 21\r\n\r\n  IDA B. WELLS\r\n\r\nUnable to deny the truth of these assertions, the charge has been made\r\nthat I have attacked Miss Willard and misrepresented the W.C.T.U. If to\r\nstate facts is misrepresentation, then I plead guilty to the charge.\r\n\r\nI said then and repeat now, that in all the ten terrible years of\r\nshooting, hanging and burning of men, women and children in America, the\r\nWomen\'s Christian Temperance Union never suggested one plan or made one\r\nmove to prevent those awful crimes. If this statement is untrue the\r\nrecords of that organization would disprove it before the ink is dry. It\r\nis clearly an issue of fact and in all fairness this charge of\r\nmisrepresentation should either be substantiated or withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, however, to make any representation concerning the\r\nW.C.T.U. and the lynching question. The record of that organization speaks\r\nfor itself. During all the years prior to the agitation begun against\r\nLynch Law, in which years men, women and children were scourged, hanged,\r\nshot and burned, the W.C.T.U. had no word, either of pity or protest; its\r\ngreat heart, which concerns itself about humanity the world over, was,\r\ntoward our cause, pulseless as a stone. Let those who deny this speak by\r\nthe record. Not until after the first British campaign, in 1893, was even\r\na resolution passed by the body which is the self-constituted guardian for\r\n"God, home and native land."\r\n\r\nNor need we go back to other years. The annual session of that\r\norganization held in Cleveland in November, 1894, made a record which\r\nconfirms and emphasizes the silence charged against it. At that session,\r\nearnest efforts were made to secure the adoption of a resolution of\r\nprotest against lynching. At that very time two men were being tried for\r\nthe murder of six colored men who were arrested on charge of barn burning,\r\nchained together, and on pretense of being taken to jail, were driven into\r\nthe woods where they were ambushed and all six shot to death. The six\r\nwidows of the butchered men had just finished the most pathetic recital\r\never heard in any court room, and the mute appeal of twenty-seven orphans\r\nfor justice touched the stoutest hearts. Only two weeks prior to the\r\nsession, Gov. Jones of Alabama, in his last message to the retiring state\r\nlegislature, cited the fact that in the two years just past, nine colored\r\nmen had been taken from the legal authorities by lynching mobs and\r\nbutchered in cold blood--and not one of these victims was even charged\r\nwith an assault upon womanhood.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that this great organization, in face of these facts, would\r\nnot hesitate to place itself on record in a resolution of protest against\r\nthis awful brutality towards colored people. Miss Willard gave assurance\r\nthat such a resolution would be adopted, and that assurance was relied on.\r\nThe record of the session shows in what good faith that assurance was\r\nkept. After recommending an expression against Lynch Law, the President\r\nattacked the antilynching movement, deliberately misrepresenting my\r\nposition, and in her annual address, charging me with a statement I never\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nFurther than that, when the committee on resolutions reported their work,\r\nnot a word was said against lynching. In the interest of the cause I\r\nsmothered the resentment. I felt because of the unwarranted and unjust\r\nattack of the President, and labored with members to secure an expression\r\nof some kind, tending to abate the awful slaughter of my race. A\r\nresolution against lynching was introduced by Mrs. Fessenden and read, and\r\nthen that great Christian body, which in its resolutions had expressed\r\nitself in opposition to the social amusement of card playing, athletic\r\nsports and promiscuous dancing; had protested against the licensing of\r\nsaloons, inveighed against tobacco, pledged its allegiance to the\r\nProhibition party, and thanked the Populist party in Kansas, the\r\nRepublican party in California and the Democratic party in the South,\r\nwholly ignored the seven millions of colored people of this country whose\r\nplea was for a word of sympathy and support for the movement in their\r\nbehalf. The resolution was not adopted, and the convention adjourned.\r\n\r\nIn the _Union Signal_ Dec. 6, 1894, among the resolutions is found this\r\none:\r\n\r\n  Resolved, That the National W.C.T.U, which has for years counted among\r\n  its departments that of peace and arbitration, is utterly opposed to all\r\n  lawless acts in any and all parts of our common lands and it urges these\r\n  principles upon the public, praying that the time may speedily come\r\n  when no human being shall be condemned without due process of law; and\r\n  when the unspeakable outrages which have so often provoked such\r\n  lawlessness shall be banished from the world, and childhood, maidenhood\r\n  and womanhood shall no more be the victims of atrocities worse than\r\n  death.\r\n\r\nThis is not the resolution offered by Mrs. Fessenden. She offered the one\r\npassed last year by the W.C.T.U. which was a strong unequivocal\r\ndenunciation of lynching. But she was told by the chairman of the\r\ncommittee on resolutions, Mrs. Rounds, that there was already a lynching\r\nresolution in the hands of the committee. Mrs. Fessenden yielded the floor\r\non that assurance, and no resolution of any kind against lynching was\r\nsubmitted and none was voted upon, not even the one above, taken from the\r\ncolumns of the _Union Signal_, the organ of the national W.C.T.U!\r\n\r\nEven the wording of this resolution which was printed by the W.C.T.U.,\r\nreiterates the false and unjust charge which has been so often made as an\r\nexcuse for lynchers. Statistics show that less than one-third of the\r\nlynching victims are hanged, shot and burned alive for "unspeakable\r\noutrages against womanhood, maidenhood and childhood;" and that nearly a\r\nthousand, including women and children, have been lynched upon any pretext\r\nwhatsoever; and that all have met death upon the unsupported word of white\r\nmen and women. Despite these facts this resolution which was printed,\r\ncloaks an apology for lawlessness, in the same paragraph which affects to\r\ncondemn it, where it speaks of "the unspeakable outrages which have so\r\noften provoked such lawlessness."\r\n\r\nMiss Willard told me the day before the resolutions were offered that the\r\nSouthern women present had held a caucus that day. This was after I, as\r\nfraternal delegate from the Woman\'s Mite Missionary Society of the A.M.E.\r\nChurch at Cleveland, O., had been introduced to tender its greetings. In\r\nso doing I expressed the hope of the colored women that the W.C.T.U. would\r\nplace itself on record as opposed to lynching which robbed them of\r\nhusbands, fathers, brothers and sons and in many cases of women as well.\r\nNo note was made either in the daily papers or the _Union Signal_ of that\r\nintroduction and greeting, although every other incident of that morning\r\nwas published. The failure to submit a lynching resolution and the wording\r\nof the one above appears to have been the result of that Southern caucus.\r\n\r\nOn the same day I had a private talk with Miss Willard and told her she\r\nhad been unjust to me and the cause in her annual address, and asked that\r\nshe correct the statement that I had misrepresented the W.C.T.U, or that I\r\nhad "put an imputation on one-half the white race in this country." She\r\nsaid that somebody in England told her it was a pity that I attacked the\r\nwhite women of America. "Oh," said I, "then you went out of your way to\r\nprejudice me and my cause in your annual address, not upon what you had\r\nheard me say, but what somebody had told you I said?" Her reply was that I\r\nmust not blame her for her rhetorical expressions--that I had my way of\r\nexpressing things and she had hers. I told her I most assuredly did blame\r\nher when those expressions were calculated to do such harm. I waited for\r\nan honest an unequivocal retraction of her statements based on "hearsay."\r\nNot a word of retraction or explanation was said in the convention and I\r\nremained misrepresented before that body through her connivance and\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nThe editorial notes in the _Union Signal_, Dec. 6, 1894, however, contains\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  In her repudiation of the charges brought by Miss Ida Wells against\r\n  white women as having taken the initiative in nameless crimes between\r\n  the races, Miss Willard said in her annual address that this statement\r\n  "put an unjust imputation upon half the white race." But as this\r\n  expression has been misunderstood she desires to declare that she did\r\n  not intend a literal interpretation to be given to the language used,\r\n  but employed it to express a tendency that might ensue in public thought\r\n  as a result of utterances so sweeping as some that have been made by\r\n  Miss Wells.\r\n\r\nBecause this explanation is as unjust as the original offense, I am forced\r\nin self-defense to submit this account of differences. I desire no quarrel\r\nwith the W.C.T.U., but my love for the truth is greater than my regard for\r\nan alleged friend who, through ignorance or design misrepresents in the\r\nmost harmful way the cause of a long suffering race, and then unable to\r\nmaintain the truth of her attack excuses herself as it were by the wave of\r\nthe hand, declaring that "she did not intend a literal interpretation to\r\nbe given to the language used." When the lives of men, women and children\r\nare at stake, when the inhuman butchers of innocents attempt to justify\r\ntheir barbarism by fastening upon a whole race the obloque of the most\r\ninfamous of crimes, it is little less than criminal to apologize for the\r\nbutchers today and tomorrow to repudiate the apology by declaring it a\r\nfigure of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nLYNCHING RECORD FOR 1894\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following tables are based on statistics taken from the columns of the\r\n_Chicago Tribune_, Jan. 1, 1895. They are a valuable appendix to the\r\nforegoing pages. They show, among other things, that in Louisiana, April\r\n23-28, eight Negroes were lynched because one white man was killed by the\r\nNegro, the latter acting in self defense. Only seven of them are given in\r\nthe list.\r\n\r\nNear Memphis, Tenn., six Negroes were lynched--this time charged with\r\nburning barns. A trial of the indicted resulted in an acquittal, although\r\nit was shown on trial that the lynching was prearranged for them. Six\r\nwidows and twenty-seven orphans are indebted to this mob for their\r\ncondition, and this lynching swells the number to eleven Negroes lynched\r\nin and about Memphis since March 9, 1892.\r\n\r\nIn Brooks County, Ga., Dec. 23, while this Christian country was preparing\r\nfor Christmas celebration, seven Negroes were lynched in twenty-four hours\r\nbecause they refused, or were unable to tell the whereabouts of a colored\r\nman named Pike, who killed a white man. The wives and daughters of these\r\nlynched men were horribly and brutally outraged by the murderers of their\r\nhusbands and fathers. But the mob has not been punished and again women\r\nand children are robbed of their protectors whose blood cries unavenged to\r\nHeaven and humanity. Georgia heads the list of lynching states.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURDER\r\n\r\nJan. 9, Samuel Smith, Greenville, Ala., Jan. 11, Sherman Wagoner,\r\nMitchell, Ind.; Jan. 12, Roscoe Parker, West Union, Ohio; Feb. 7, Henry\r\nBruce, Gulch Co., Ark.; March 5, Sylvester Rhodes, Collins, Ga.; March 15,\r\nRichard Puryea, Stroudsburg, Pa.; March 29, Oliver Jackson, Montgomery,\r\nAla.; March 30, ---- Saybrick, Fisher\'s Ferry, Miss.; April 14, William\r\nLewis, Lanison, Ala.; April 23, Jefferson Luggle, Cherokee, Kan.; April\r\n23, Samuel Slaugate, Tallulah, La.; April 23, Thomas Claxton, Tallulah,\r\nLa.; April 23, David Hawkins, Tallulah, La.; April 27, Thel Claxton,\r\nTallulah, La.; April 27, Comp Claxton, Tallulah, La.; April 27, Scot\r\nHarvey, Tallulah, La.; April 27, Jerry McCly, Tallulah, La.; May 17, Henry\r\nScott, Jefferson, Tex.; May 15, Coat Williams, Pine Grove, Fla.; June 2,\r\nJefferson Crawford, Bethesda, S.C.; June 4, Thondo Underwood, Monroe, La.;\r\nJune 8, Isaac Kemp, Cape Charles, Va.; June 13, Lon Hall, Sweethouse,\r\nTex.; June 13, Bascom Cook, Sweethouse, Tex.; June 15, Luke Thomas,\r\nBiloxi, Miss.; June 29, John Williams, Sulphur, Tex.; June 29, Ulysses\r\nHayden, Monett, Mo.; July 6, ---- Hood, Amite, Miss.; July 7, James Bell,\r\nCharlotte, Tenn.; Sept. 2, Henderson Hollander, Elkhorn, W.

Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nTHE REMEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a well-established principle of law that every wrong has a remedy.\r\nHerein rests our respect for law. The Negro does not claim that all of the\r\none thousand black men, women and children, who have been hanged, shot and\r\nburned alive during the past ten years, were innocent of the charges made\r\nagainst them. We have associated too long with the white man not to have\r\ncopied his vices as well as his virtues. But we do insist that the\r\npunishment is not the same for both classes of criminals. In lynching,\r\nopportunity is not given the Negro to defend himself against the\r\nunsupported accusations of white men and women. The word of the accuser is\r\nheld to be true and the excited bloodthirsty mob demands that the rule of\r\nlaw be reversed and instead of proving the accused to be guilty, the\r\nvictim of their hate and revenge must prove himself innocent. No evidence\r\nhe can offer will satisfy the mob; he is bound hand and foot and swung\r\ninto eternity. Then to excuse its infamy, the mob almost invariably\r\nreports the monstrous falsehood that its victim made a full confession\r\nbefore he was hanged.\r\n\r\nWith all military, legal and political power in their hands, only two of\r\nthe lynching States have attempted a check by exercising the power which\r\nis theirs. Mayor Trout, of Roanoke, Virginia, called out the militia in\r\n1893, to protect a Negro prisoner, and in so doing nine men were killed\r\nand a number wounded. Then the mayor and militia withdrew, left the Negro\r\nto his fate and he was promptly lynched. The business men realized the\r\nblow to the town\'s were given light sentences, the highest being one of\r\ntwelve financial interests, called the mayor home, the grand jury\r\nindicted and prosecuted the ringleaders of the mob. They months in State\r\nprison. The day he arrived at the penitentiary, he was pardoned by the\r\ngovernor of the State.\r\n\r\nThe only other real attempt made by the authorities to protect a prisoner\r\nof the law, and which was more successful, was that of Gov. McKinley, of\r\nOhio, who sent the militia to Washington Courthouse, O., in October, 1894,\r\nand five men were killed and twenty wounded in maintaining the principle\r\nthat the law must be upheld.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, in April, 1893, Gov. Tillman aided the mob by yielding\r\nup to be killed, a prisoner of the law, who had voluntarily placed himself\r\nunder the Governor\'s protection. Public sentiment by its representatives\r\nhas encouraged Lynch Law, and upon the revolution of this sentiment we\r\nmust depend for its abolition.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we demand a fair trial by law for those accused of crime, and\r\npunishment by law after honest conviction. No maudlin sympathy for\r\ncriminals is solicited, but we do ask that the law shall punish all alike.\r\nWe earnestly desire those that control the forces which make public\r\nsentiment to join with us in the demand. Surely the humanitarian spirit of\r\nthis country which reaches out to denounce the treatment of the Russian\r\nJews, the Armenian Christians, the laboring poor of Europe, the Siberian\r\nexiles and the native women of India--will not longer refuse to lift its\r\nvoice on this subject. If it were known that the cannibals or the savage\r\nIndians had burned three human beings alive in the past two years, the\r\nwhole of Christendom would be roused, to devise ways and means to put a\r\nstop to it. Can you remain silent and inactive when such things are done\r\nin our own community and country? Is your duty to humanity in the United\r\nStates less binding?\r\n\r\nWhat can you do, reader, to prevent lynching, to thwart anarchy and\r\npromote law and order throughout our land?\r\n\r\n1st. You can help disseminate the facts contained in this book by bringing\r\nthem to the knowledge of every one with whom you come in contact, to the\r\nend that public sentiment may be revolutionized. Let the facts speak for\r\nthemselves, with you as a medium.\r\n\r\n2d. You can be instrumental in having churches, missionary societies,\r\nY.M.C.A.\'s, W.C.T.U.\'s and all Christian and moral forces in connection\r\nwith your religious and social life, pass resolutions of condemnation and\r\nprotest every time a lynching takes place; and see that they axe sent to\r\nthe place where these outrages occur.\r\n\r\n3d. Bring to the intelligent consideration of Southern people the refusal\r\nof capital to invest where lawlessness and mob violence hold sway. Many\r\nlabor organizations have declared by resolution that they would avoid\r\nlynch infested localities as they would the pestilence when seeking new\r\nhomes. If the South wishes to build up its waste places quickly, there is\r\nno better way than to uphold the majesty of the law by enforcing obedience\r\nto the same, and meting out the same punishment to all classes of\r\ncriminals, white as well as black. "Equality before the law," must become\r\na fact as well as a theory before America is truly the "land of the free\r\nand the home of the brave."\r\n\r\n4th. Think and act on independent lines in this behalf, remembering that\r\nafter all, it is the white man\'s civilization and the white man\'s\r\ngovernment which are on trial. This crusade will determine whether that\r\ncivilization can maintain itself by itself, or whether anarchy shall\r\nprevail; Whether this Nation shall write itself down a success at self\r\ngovernment, or in deepest humiliation admit its failure complete; whether\r\nthe precepts and theories of Christianity are professed and practiced by\r\nAmerican white people as Golden Rules of thought and action, or adopted as\r\na system of morals to be preached to, heathen until they attain to the\r\nintelligence which needs the system of Lynch Law.\r\n\r\n5th. Congressman Blair offered a resolution in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, August, 1894. The organized life of the country can\r\nspeedily make this a law by sending resolutions to Congress indorsing Mr.\r\nBlair\'s bill and asking Congress to create the commission. In no better\r\nway can the question be settled, and the Negro does not fear the issue.\r\nThe following is the resolution:\r\n\r\n  Resolved, By the House of Representatives and Senate in congress\r\n  assembled, That the committee on labor be instructed to investigate and\r\n  report the number, location and date of all alleged assaults by males\r\n  upon females throughout the country during the ten years last preceding\r\n  the passing of this joint resolution, for or on account of which\r\n  organized but unlawful violence has been inflicted or attempted to be\r\n  inflicted. Also to ascertain and report all facts of organized but\r\n  unlawful violence to the person, with the attendant facts and\r\n  circumstances, which have been inflicted upon accused persons alleged to\r\n  have been guilty of crimes punishable by due process of law which have\r\n  taken place in any part of the country within the ten years last\r\n  preceding the passage of this resolution. Such investigation shall be\r\n  made by the usual methods and agencies of the Department of Labor, and\r\n  report made to Congress as soon as the work can be satisfactorily done,\r\n  and the sum of $25,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is\r\n  hereby appropriated to pay the expenses out of any money in the treasury\r\n  not otherwise appropriated.\r\n\r\nThe belief has been constantly expressed in England that in the United\r\nStates, which has produced Wm. Lloyd Garrison, Henry Ward Beecher, James\r\nRussell Lowell, John G. Whittier and Abraham Lincoln there must be those\r\nof their descendants who would take hold of the work of inaugurating an\r\nera of law and order. The colored people of this country who have been\r\nloyal to the flag believe the same, and strong in that belief have begun\r\nthis crusade. To those who still feel they have no obligation in the\r\nmatter, we commend the following lines of Lowell on "Freedom."\r\n\r\n    Men! whose boast it is that ye\r\n    Come of fathers brave and free,\r\n    If there breathe on earth a slave\r\n    Are ye truly free and brave?\r\n    If ye do not feel the chain,\r\n    When it works a brother\'s pain,\r\n    Are ye not base slaves indeed,\r\n    Slaves unworthy to be freed?\r\n\r\n    Women! who shall one day bear\r\n    Sons to breathe New England air,\r\n    If ye hear without a blush,\r\n    Deeds to make the roused blood rush\r\n    Like red lava through your veins,\r\n    For your sisters now in chains,--\r\n    Answer! are ye fit to be\r\n    Mothers of the brave and free?\r\n\r\n    Is true freedom but to break\r\n    Fetters for our own dear sake,\r\n    And, with leathern hearts, forget\r\n    That we owe mankind a debt?\r\n    No! true freedom is to share\r\n    All the chains our brothers wear,\r\n    And, with heart and hand, to be\r\n    Earnest to make others free!\r\n\r\n    There are slaves who fear to speak\r\n    For the fallen and the weak;\r\n    They are slaves who will not choose\r\n    Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,\r\n    Rather than in silence shrink\r\n    From the truth they needs must think;\r\n    They are slaves who dare not be\r\n    In the right with two or three.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FIELD FOR PRACTICAL WORK\r\n\r\nThe very frequent inquiry made after my lectures by interested friends is\r\n"What can I do to help the cause?" The answer always is: "Tell the world\r\nthe facts." When the Christian world knows the alarming growth and extent\r\nof outlawry in our land, some means will be found to stop it.\r\n\r\nThe object of this publication is to tell the facts, and friends of the\r\ncause can lend a helping hand by aiding in the distribution of these\r\nbooks. When I present our cause to a minister, editor, lecturer, or\r\nrepresentative of any moral agency, the first demand is for facts and\r\nfigures. Plainly, I can not then hand out a book with a twenty-five-cent\r\ntariff on the information contained. This would be only a new method in\r\nthe book agents\' art. In all such cases it is a pleasure to submit this\r\nbook for investigation, with the certain assurance of gaining a friend to\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nThere are many agencies which may be enlisted in our cause by the general\r\ncirculation of the facts herein contained. The preachers, teachers,\r\neditors and humanitarians of the white race, at home and abroad, must have\r\nfacts laid before them, and it is our duty to supply these facts. The\r\nCentral Anti-Lynching League, Room 9, 128 Clark St., Chicago, has\r\nestablished a Free Distribution Fund, the work of which can be promoted by\r\nall who are interested in this work.\r\n\r\nAntilynching leagues, societies and individuals can order books from this\r\nfund at agents\' rates. The books will be sent to their order, or, if\r\ndesired, will be distributed by the League among those whose cooperative\r\naid we so greatly need. The writer hereof assures prompt distribution of\r\nbooks according to order, and public acknowledgment of all orders through\r\nthe public press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Red Record, by Ida B.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
