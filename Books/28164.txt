A new book just hot from the brain is\r\nnaturally apt to appear faulty to its begetter, but an old book has got\r\ninto the proper perspective and may be praised by him without fear or\r\nfavor. "The Big Bow Mystery" seems to me an excellent murder story, as\r\nmurder stories go, for, while as sensational as the most of them, it\r\ncontains more humor and character creation than the best. Indeed, the\r\nhumor is too abundant. Mysteries should be sedate and sober. There\r\nshould be a pervasive atmosphere of horror and awe such as Poe manages\r\nto create. Humor is out of tone; it would be more artistic to preserve a\r\nsomber note throughout. But I was a realist in those days, and in real\r\nlife mysteries occur to real persons with their individual humors, and\r\nmysterious circumstances are apt to be complicated by comic. The\r\nindispensable condition of a good mystery is that it should be able and\r\nunable to be solved by the reader, and that the writer\'s solution should\r\nsatisfy. Many a mystery runs on breathlessly enough till the denouement\r\nis reached, only to leave the reader with the sense of having been\r\nrobbed of his breath under false pretenses. And not only must the\r\nsolution be adequate, but all its data must be given in the body of the\r\nstory. The author must not suddenly spring a new person or a new\r\ncircumstance upon his reader at the end. Thus, if a friend were to ask\r\nme to guess who dined with him yesterday, it would be fatuous if he had\r\nin mind somebody of whom he knew I had never heard. The only person who\r\nhas ever solved "The Big Bow Mystery" is myself. This is not paradox but\r\nplain fact. For long before the book was written, I said to myself one\r\nnight that no mystery-monger had ever murdered a man in a room to which\r\nthere was no possible access. The puzzle was scarcely propounded ere the\r\nsolution flew up and the idea lay stored in my mind till, years later,\r\nduring the silly season, the editor of a popular London evening paper,\r\nanxious to let the sea-serpent have a year off, asked me to provide him\r\nwith a more original piece of fiction. I might have refused, but there\r\nwas murder in my soul, and here was the opportunity. I went to work\r\nseriously, though the _Morning Post_ subsequently said the skit was too\r\nlabored, and I succeeded at least in exciting my readers, so many of\r\nwhom sent in unsolicited testimonials in the shape of solutions during\r\nthe run of the story that, when it ended, the editor asked me to say\r\nsomething by way of acknowledgement. Thereupon I wrote a letter to the\r\npaper, thanking the would-be solvers for their kindly attempts to help\r\nme out of the mess into which I had got the plot. I did not like to\r\nwound their feelings by saying straight out that they had failed, one\r\nand all, to hit on the real murderer, just like real police, so I tried\r\nto break the truth to them in a roundabout, mendacious fashion, as thus:\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of "The Star."_\r\n\r\n     SIR: Now that "The Big Bow Mystery" is solved to the satisfaction\r\n     of at least one person, will you allow that person the use of your\r\n     invaluable columns to enable him to thank the hundreds of your\r\n     readers who have favored him with their kind suggestions and\r\n     solutions while his tale was running and they were reading? I ask\r\n     this more especially because great credit is due to them for\r\n     enabling me to end the story in a manner so satisfactory to myself.\r\n     When I started it, I had, of course, no idea who had done the\r\n     murder, but I was determined no one should guess it. Accordingly,\r\n     as each correspondent sent in the name of a suspect, I determined\r\n     he or she should not be the guilty party. By degrees every one of\r\n     the characters got ticked off as innocent--all except one, and I\r\n     had no option but to make that character the murderer. I was very\r\n     sorry to do this, as I rather liked that particular person, but\r\n     when one has such ingenious readers, what can one do? You can\'t let\r\n     anybody boast that he guessed aright, and, in spite of the trouble\r\n     of altering the plot five or six times, I feel that I have chosen\r\n     the course most consistent with the dignity of my profession. Had I\r\n     not been impelled by this consideration I should certainly have\r\n     brought in a verdict against Mrs. Drabdump, as recommended by the\r\n     reader who said that, judging by the illustration in the "Star,"\r\n     she must be at least seven feet high, and, therefore, could easily\r\n     have got on the roof and put her (proportionately) long arm down\r\n     the chimney to effect the cut. I am not responsible for the\r\n     artist\'s conception of the character. When I last saw the good lady\r\n     she was under six feet, but your artist may have had later\r\n     information. The "Star" is always so frightfully up to date. I\r\n     ought not to omit the humorous remark of a correspondent, who said:\r\n     "Mortlake might have swung in some wild way from one window to\r\n     another, _at any rate in a story_." I hope my fellow-writers thus\r\n     satirically prodded will not demand his name, as I object to\r\n     murders, "at any rate in real life." Finally, a word with the\r\n     legions who have taken me to task for allowing Mr. Gladstone to\r\n     write over 170 words on a postcard. It is all owing to you, sir,\r\n     who announced my story as containing humorous elements. I tried to\r\n     put in some, and this gentle dig at the grand old correspondent\'s\r\n     habits was intended to be one of them. However, if I _am_ to be\r\n     taken "at the foot of the letter" (or rather of the postcard), I\r\n     must say that only to-day I received a postcard containing about\r\n     250 words. But this was not from Mr. Gladstone. At any rate, till\r\n     Mr. Gladstone himself repudiates this postcard, I shall consider\r\n     myself justified in allowing it to stand in the book.\r\n\r\n     Again thanking your readers for their valuable assistance, Yours,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\nOne would have imagined that nobody could take this seriously, for it is\r\nobvious that the mystery-story is just the one species of story that can\r\nnot be told impromptu or altered at the last moment, seeing that it\r\ndemands the most careful piecing together and the most elaborate\r\ndove-tailing. Nevertheless, if you cast your joke upon the waters, you\r\nshall find it no joke after many days. This is what I read in the\r\n_Lyttelton Times_, New Zealand: "The chain of circumstantial evidence\r\nseems fairly irrefragable. From all accounts, Mr. Zangwill himself was\r\npuzzled, after carefully forging every link, how to break it. The method\r\nultimately adopted I consider more ingenious than convincing." After\r\nthat I made up my mind never to joke again, but this good intention now\r\nhelps to pave the beaten path.\r\n\r\n    I. ZANGWILL.\r\n    LONDON, September, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mystery which the author will always associate with this story is\r\nhow he got through the task of writing it. It was written in a\r\nfortnight--day by day--to meet a sudden demand from the "Star," which\r\nmade "a new departure" with it.\r\n\r\nThe said fortnight was further disturbed by an extraordinary combined\r\nattack of other troubles and tasks. This is no excuse for the\r\nshortcomings of the book, as it was always open to the writer to revise\r\nor suppress it. The latter function may safely be left to the public,\r\nwhile if the work stands--almost to a letter--as it appeared in the\r\n"Star," it is because the author cannot tell a story more than once.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Mr. Gladstone into a fictitious scene is defended on\r\nthe ground that he is largely mythical.\r\n\r\n    I. Z.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIG BOW MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a memorable morning of early December London opened its eyes on a\r\nfrigid gray mist. There are mornings when King Fog masses his molecules\r\nof carbon in serried squadrons in the city, while he scatters them\r\ntenuously in the suburbs; so that your morning train may bear you from\r\ntwilight to darkness. But to-day the enemy\'s maneuvering was more\r\nmonotonous. From Bow even unto Hammersmith there draggled a dull,\r\nwretched vapor, like the wraith of an impecunious suicide come into a\r\nfortune immediately after the fatal deed. The barometers and\r\nthermometers had sympathetically shared its depression, and their\r\nspirits (when they had any) were low. The cold cut like a many-bladed\r\nknife.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump, of 11 Glover Street, Bow, was one of the few persons in\r\nLondon whom fog did not depress. She went about her work quite as\r\ncheerlessly as usual. She had been among the earliest to be aware of the\r\nenemy\'s advent, picking out the strands of fog from the coils of\r\ndarkness the moment she rolled up her bedroom blind and unveiled the\r\nsomber picture of the winter morning. She knew that the fog had come to\r\nstay for the day at least, and that the gas bill for the quarter was\r\ngoing to beat the record in high-jumping. She also knew that this was\r\nbecause she had allowed her new gentleman lodger, Mr. Arthur Constant,\r\nto pay a fixed sum of a shilling a week for gas, instead of charging him\r\na proportion of the actual account for the whole house. The\r\nmeteorologists might have saved the credit of their science if they had\r\nreckoned with Mrs. Drabdump\'s next gas bill when they predicted the\r\nweather and made "Snow" the favorite, and said that "Fog" would be\r\nnowhere. Fog was everywhere, yet Mrs. Drabdump took no credit to herself\r\nfor her prescience. Mrs. Drabdump indeed took no credit for anything,\r\npaying her way along doggedly, and struggling through life like a\r\nwearied swimmer trying to touch the horizon. That things always went as\r\nbadly as she had foreseen did not exhilarate her in the least.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump was a widow. Widows are not born, but made, else you might\r\nhave fancied Mrs. Drabdump had always been a widow. Nature had given her\r\nthat tall, spare form, and that pale, thin-lipped, elongated, hard-eyed\r\nvisage, and that painfully precise hair, which are always associated\r\nwith widowhood in low life. It is only in higher circles that women can\r\nlose their husbands and yet remain bewitching. The late Mr. Drabdump had\r\nscratched the base of his thumb with a rusty nail, and Mrs. Drabdump\'s\r\nforeboding that he would die of lockjaw had not prevented her wrestling\r\nday and night with the shadow of Death, as she had wrestled with it\r\nvainly twice before, when Katie died of diphtheria and little Johnny of\r\nscarlet fever. Perhaps it is from overwork among the poor that Death has\r\nbeen reduced to a shadow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump was lighting the kitchen fire. She did it very\r\nscientifically, as knowing the contrariety of coal and the anxiety of\r\nflaming sticks to end in smoke unless rigidly kept up to the mark.\r\nScience was a success as usual; and Mrs. Drabdump rose from her knees\r\ncontent, like a Parsee priestess who had duly paid her morning devotions\r\nto her deity. Then she started violently, and nearly lost her balance.\r\nHer eye had caught the hands of the clock on the mantel. They pointed to\r\nfifteen minutes to seven. Mrs. Drabdump\'s devotion to the kitchen fire\r\ninvariably terminated at fifteen minutes past six. What was the matter\r\nwith the clock?\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump had an immediate vision of Snoppet, the neighboring\r\nhorologist, keeping the clock in hand for weeks and then returning it\r\nonly superficially repaired and secretly injured more vitally "for the\r\ngood of the trade." The evil vision vanished as quickly as it came,\r\nexorcised by the deep boom of St. Dunstan\'s bells chiming the\r\nthree-quarters. In its place a great horror surged. Instinct had failed;\r\nMrs. Drabdump had risen at half-past six instead of six. Now she\r\nunderstood why she had been feeling so dazed and strange and sleepy. She\r\nhad overslept herself.\r\n\r\nChagrined and puzzled, she hastily set the kettle over the crackling\r\ncoal, discovering a second later that she had overslept herself because\r\nMr. Constant wished to be woke three-quarters of an hour earlier than\r\nusual, and to have his breakfast at seven, having to speak at an early\r\nmeeting of discontented tram-men. She ran at once, candle in hand, to\r\nhis bedroom. It was upstairs. All "upstairs" was Arthur Constant\'s\r\ndomain, for it consisted of but two mutually independent rooms. Mrs.\r\nDrabdump knocked viciously at the door of the one he used for a bedroom,\r\ncrying, "Seven o\'clock, sir. You\'ll be late, sir. You must get up at\r\nonce." The usual slumbrous "All right" was not forthcoming; but, as she\r\nherself had varied her morning salute, her ear was less expectant of the\r\necho. She went downstairs, with no foreboding save that the kettle would\r\ncome off second best in the race between its boiling and her lodger\'s\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\nFor she knew there was no fear of Arthur Constant\'s lying deaf to the\r\ncall of duty--temporarily represented by Mrs. Drabdump. He was a light\r\nsleeper, and the tram conductors\' bells were probably ringing in his\r\nears, summoning him to the meeting. Why Arthur Constant, B.\r\nA.--white-handed and white-shirted, and gentleman to the very purse of\r\nhim--should concern himself with tram-men, when fortune had confined his\r\nnecessary relations with drivers to cabmen at the least, Mrs. Drabdump\r\ncould not quite make out. He probably aspired to represent Bow in\r\nParliament; but then it would surely have been wiser to lodge with a\r\nlandlady who possessed a vote by having a husband alive. Nor was there\r\nmuch practical wisdom in his wish to black his own boots (an occupation\r\nin which he shone but little), and to live in every way like a Bow\r\nworking man. Bow working men were not so lavish in their patronage of\r\nwater, whether existing in drinking glasses, morning tubs, or laundress\'\r\nestablishments. Nor did they eat the delicacies with which Mrs. Drabdump\r\nsupplied him, with the assurance that they were the artisan\'s appanage.\r\nShe could not bear to see him eat things unbefitting his station. Arthur\r\nConstant opened his mouth and ate what his landlady gave him, not first\r\ndeliberately shutting his eyes according to the formula, the rather\r\npluming himself on keeping them very wide open. But it is difficult for\r\nsaints to see through their own halos; and in practice an aureola about\r\nthe head is often indistinguishable from a mist. The tea to be scalded\r\nin Mr. Constant\'s pot, when that cantankerous kettle should boil, was\r\nnot the coarse mixture of black and green sacred to herself and Mr.\r\nMortlake, of whom the thoughts of breakfast now reminded her. Poor Mr.\r\nMortlake, gone off without any to Devonport, somewhere about four in the\r\nfog-thickened darkness of a winter night! Well, she hoped his journey\r\nwould be duly rewarded, that his perks would be heavy, and that he would\r\nmake as good a thing out of the "traveling expenses" as rival labor\r\nleaders roundly accused him of to other people\'s faces. She did not\r\ngrudge him his gains, nor was it her business if, as they alleged, in\r\nintroducing Mr. Constant to her vacant rooms, his idea was not merely to\r\nbenefit his landlady. He had done her an uncommon good turn, queer as\r\nwas the lodger thus introduced. His own apostleship to the sons of toil\r\ngave Mrs. Drabdump no twinges of perplexity. Tom Mortlake had been a\r\ncompositor; and apostleship was obviously a profession better paid and\r\nof a higher social status. Tom Mortlake--the hero of a hundred\r\nstrikes--set up in print on a poster, was unmistakably superior to Tom\r\nMortlake setting up other men\'s names at a case. Still, the work was not\r\nall beer and skittles, and Mrs. Drabdump felt that Tom\'s latest job was\r\nnot enviable. She shook his door as she passed it on her way to the\r\nkitchen, but there was no response. The street door was only a few feet\r\noff down the passage, and a glance at it dispelled the last hope that\r\nTom had abandoned the journey. The door was unbolted and unchained, and\r\nthe only security was the latch-key lock. Mrs. Drabdump felt a whit\r\nuneasy, though, to give her her due, she never suffered as much as most\r\nhousewives do from criminals who never come. Not quite opposite, but\r\nstill only a few doors off, on the other side of the street, lived the\r\ncelebrated ex-detective, Grodman, and, illogically enough, his presence\r\nin the street gave Mrs. Drabdump a curious sense of security, as of a\r\nbeliever living under the shadow of the fane. That any human being of\r\nill-odor should consciously come within a mile of the scent of so famous\r\na sleuth-hound seemed to her highly improbable. Grodman had retired\r\n(with a competence) and was only a sleeping dog now; still, even\r\ncriminals would have sense enough to let him lie.\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Drabdump did not really feel that there had been any danger,\r\nespecially as a second glance at the street door showed that Mortlake\r\nhad been thoughtful enough to slip the loop that held back the bolt of\r\nthe big lock. She allowed herself another throb of sympathy for the\r\nlabor leader whirling on his dreary way toward Devonport Dockyard. Not\r\nthat he had told her anything of his journey beyond the town; but she\r\nknew Devonport had a Dockyard because Jessie Dymond--Tom\'s\r\nsweetheart--once mentioned that her aunt lived near there, and it lay on\r\nthe surface that Tom had gone to help the dockers, who were imitating\r\ntheir London brethren. Mrs. Drabdump did not need to be told things to\r\nbe aware of them. She went back to prepare Mr. Constant\'s superfine tea,\r\nvaguely wondering why people were so discontented nowadays. But when she\r\nbrought up the tea and the toast and the eggs to Mr. Constant\'s\r\nsitting-room (which adjoined his bedroom, though without communicating\r\nwith it), Mr. Constant was not sitting in it. She lit the gas, and laid\r\nthe cloth; then she returned to the landing and beat at the bedroom door\r\nwith an imperative palm. Silence alone answered her. She called him by\r\nname and told him the hour, but hers was the only voice she heard, and\r\nit sounded strangely to her in the shadows of the staircase. Then,\r\nmuttering, "Poor gentleman, he had the toothache last night; and p\'r\'aps\r\nhe\'s only just got a wink o\' sleep. Pity to disturb him for the sake of\r\nthem grizzling conductors. I\'ll let him sleep his usual time," she bore\r\nthe tea-pot downstairs with a mournful, almost poetic, consciousness,\r\nthat soft-boiled eggs (like love) must grow cold.\r\n\r\nHalf-past seven came--and she knocked again. But Constant slept on.\r\n\r\nHis letters, always a strange assortment, arrived at eight, and a\r\ntelegram came soon after. Mrs. Drabdump rattled his door, shouted, and\r\nat last put the wire under it. Her heart was beating fast enough now,\r\nthough there seemed to be a cold, clammy snake curling round it. She\r\nwent downstairs again and turned the handle of Mortlake\'s room, and went\r\nin without knowing why. The coverlet of the bed showed that the occupant\r\nhad only lain down in his clothes, as if fearing to miss the early\r\ntrain. She had not for a moment expected to find him in the room; yet\r\nsomehow the consciousness that she was alone in the house with the\r\nsleeping Constant seemed to flash for the first time upon her, and the\r\nclammy snake tightened its folds round her heart.\r\n\r\nShe opened the street door, and her eye wandered nervously up and down.\r\nIt was half-past eight. The little street stretched cold and still in\r\nthe gray mist, blinking bleary eyes at either end, where the street\r\nlamps smoldered on. No one was visible for the moment, though smoke was\r\nrising from many of the chimneys to greet its sister mist. At the house\r\nof the detective across the way the blinds were still down and the\r\nshutters up. Yet the familiar, prosaic aspect of the street calmed her.\r\nThe bleak air set her coughing; she slammed the door to, and returned to\r\nthe kitchen to make fresh tea for Constant, who could only be in a deep\r\nsleep. But the canister trembled in her grasp. She did not know whether\r\nshe dropped it or threw it down, but there was nothing in the hand that\r\nbattered again a moment later at the bedroom door. No sound within\r\nanswered the clamor without. She rained blow upon blow in a sort of\r\nspasm of frenzy, scarce remembering that her object was merely to wake\r\nher lodger, and almost staving in the lower panels with her kicks. Then\r\nshe turned the handle and tried to open the door, but it was locked. The\r\nresistance recalled her to herself--she had a moment of shocked decency\r\nat the thought that she had been about to enter Constant\'s bedroom. Then\r\nthe terror came over her afresh. She felt that she was alone in the\r\nhouse with a corpse. She sank to the floor, cowering; with difficulty\r\nstifling a desire to scream. Then she rose with a jerk and raced down\r\nthe stairs without looking behind her, and threw open the door and ran\r\nout into the street, only pulling up with her hand violently agitating\r\nGrodman\'s door-knocker. In a moment the first floor window was\r\nraised--the little house was of the same pattern as her own--and\r\nGrodman\'s full, fleshy face loomed through the fog in sleepy irritation\r\nfrom under a nightcap. Despite its scowl the ex-detective\'s face dawned\r\nupon her like the sun upon an occupant of the haunted chamber.\r\n\r\n"What in the devil\'s the matter?" he growled. Grodman was not an early\r\nbird, now that he had no worms to catch. He could afford to despise\r\nproverbs now, for the house in which he lived was his, and he lived in\r\nit because several other houses in the street were also his, and it is\r\nwell for the landlord to be about his own estate in Bow, where poachers\r\noften shoot the moon. Perhaps the desire to enjoy his greatness among\r\nhis early cronies counted for something, too, for he had been born and\r\nbred at Bow, receiving when a youth his first engagement from the local\r\npolice quarters, whence he drew a few shillings a week as an amateur\r\ndetective in his leisure hours.\r\n\r\nGrodman was still a bachelor. In the celestial matrimonial bureau a\r\npartner might have been selected for him, but he had never been able to\r\ndiscover her. It was his one failure as a detective. He was a\r\nself-sufficing person, who preferred a gas stove to a domestic; but in\r\ndeference to Glover Street opinion he admitted a female factotum between\r\nten a. m. and ten p. m., and, equally in deference to Glover Street\r\nopinion, excluded her between ten p. m. and ten a. m.\r\n\r\n"I want you to come across at once," Mrs. Drabdump gasped. "Something\r\nhas happened to Mr. Constant."\r\n\r\n"What! Not bludgeoned by the police at the meeting this morning, I\r\nhope?"\r\n\r\n"No, no! He didn\'t go. He is dead."\r\n\r\n"Dead?" Grodman\'s face grew very serious now.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Murdered!"\r\n\r\n"What?" almost shouted the ex-detective. "How? When? Where? Who?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I can\'t get to him. I have beaten at his door. He does\r\nnot answer."\r\n\r\nGrodman\'s face lit up with relief.\r\n\r\n"You silly woman! Is that all? I shall have a cold in my head. Bitter\r\nweather. He\'s dog-tired after yesterday--processions, three speeches,\r\nkindergarten, lecture on \'the moon,\' article on co-operation. That\'s his\r\nstyle." It was also Grodman\'s style. He never wasted words.\r\n\r\n"No," Mrs. Drabdump breathed up at him solemnly, "he\'s dead."\r\n\r\n"All right; go back. Don\'t alarm the neighborhood unnecessarily. Wait\r\nfor me. Down in five minutes." Grodman did not take this Cassandra of\r\nthe kitchen too seriously. Probably he knew his woman. His small,\r\nbead-like eyes glittered with an almost amused smile as he withdrew them\r\nfrom Mrs. Drabdump\'s ken, and shut down the sash with a bang. The poor\r\nwoman ran back across the road and through her door, which she would not\r\nclose behind her. It seemed to shut her in with the dead. She waited in\r\nthe passage. After an age--seven minutes by any honest clock--Grodman\r\nmade his appearance, looking as dressed as usual, but with unkempt hair\r\nand with disconsolate side-whisker. He was not quite used to that\r\nside-whisker yet, for it had only recently come within the margin of\r\ncultivation. In active service Grodman had been clean-shaven, like all\r\nmembers of the profession--for surely your detective is the most\r\nversatile of actors. Mrs. Drabdump closed the street door quietly, and\r\npointed to the stairs, fear operating like a polite desire to give him\r\nprecedence. Grodman ascended, amusement still glimmering in his eyes.\r\nArrived on the landing he knocked peremptorily at the door, crying,\r\n"Nine o\'clock, Mr. Constant; nine o\'clock!" When he ceased there was no\r\nother sound or movement. His face grew more serious. He waited, then\r\nknocked, and cried louder. He turned the handle, but the door was fast.\r\nHe tried to peer through the keyhole, but it was blocked. He shook the\r\nupper panels, but the door seemed bolted as well as locked. He stood\r\nstill, his face set and rigid, for he liked and esteemed the man.\r\n\r\n"Ay, knock your loudest," whispered the pale-faced woman. "You\'ll not\r\nwake him now."\r\n\r\nThe gray mist had followed them through the street door, and hovered\r\nabout the staircase, charging the air with a moist, sepulchral odor.\r\n\r\n"Locked and bolted," muttered Grodman, shaking the door afresh.\r\n\r\n"Burst it open," breathed the woman, trembling violently all over, and\r\nholding her hands before her as if to ward off the dreadful vision.\r\nWithout another word, Grodman applied his shoulder to the door, and made\r\na violent muscular effort. He had been an athlete in his time, and the\r\nsap was yet in him. The door creaked, little by little it began to give,\r\nthe woodwork enclosing the bolt of the lock splintered, the panels bent\r\nupward, the large upper bolt tore off its iron staple; the door flew\r\nback with a crash. Grodman rushed in.\r\n\r\n"My God!" he cried. The woman shrieked. The sight was too terrible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours the jubilant news-boys were shrieking "Horrible\r\nSuicide in Bow," and "The Star" poster added, for the satisfaction of\r\nthose too poor to purchase: "A Philanthropist Cuts His Throat."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the newspapers were premature. Scotland Yard refused to prejudge the\r\ncase despite the penny-a-liners. Several arrests were made, so that the\r\nlater editions were compelled to soften "Suicide" into "Mystery." The\r\npeople arrested were a nondescript collection of tramps. Most of them\r\nhad committed other offenses for which the police had not arrested them.\r\nOne bewildered-looking gentleman gave himself up (as if he were a\r\nriddle), but the police would have none of him, and restored him\r\nforthwith to his friends and keepers. The number of candidates for each\r\nnew opening in Newgate is astonishing.\r\n\r\nThe full significance of this tragedy of a noble young life cut short\r\nhad hardly time to filter into the public mind, when a fresh sensation\r\nabsorbed it. Tom Mortlake had been arrested the same day at Liverpool on\r\nsuspicion of being concerned in the death of his fellow-lodger. The news\r\nfell like a bombshell upon a land in which Tom Mortlake\'s name was a\r\nhousehold word. That the gifted artisan orator, who had never shrunk\r\nupon occasion from launching red rhetoric at Society, should actually\r\nhave shed blood seemed too startling, especially as the blood shed was\r\nnot blue, but the property of a lovable young middle-class idealist, who\r\nhad now literally given his life to the Cause. But this supplementary\r\nsensation did not grow to a head, and everybody (save a few labor\r\nleaders) was relieved to hear that Tom had been released almost\r\nimmediately, being merely subpoenaed to appear at the inquest. In an\r\ninterview which he accorded to the representative of a Liverpool paper\r\nthe same afternoon, he stated that he put his arrest down entirely to\r\nthe enmity and rancor entertained toward him by the police throughout\r\nthe country. He had come to Liverpool to trace the movements of a friend\r\nabout whom he was very uneasy, and he was making anxious inquiries at\r\nthe docks to discover at what times steamers left for America, when the\r\ndetectives stationed there in accordance with instructions from\r\nheadquarters had arrested him as a suspicious-looking character.\r\n"Though," said Tom, "they must very well have known my phiz, as I have\r\nbeen sketched and caricatured all over the shop. When I told them who I\r\nwas they had the decency to let me go. They thought they\'d scored off me\r\nenough, I reckon. Yes, it certainly is a strange coincidence that I\r\nmight actually have had something to do with the poor fellow\'s death,\r\nwhich has cut me up as much as anybody; though if they had known I had\r\njust come from the \'scene of the crime,\' and actually lived in the\r\nhouse, they would probably have--let me alone." He laughed\r\nsarcastically. "They are a queer lot of muddle-heads are the police.\r\nTheir motto is, \'First catch your man, then cook the evidence.\' If\r\nyou\'re on the spot you\'re guilty because you\'re there, and if you\'re\r\nelsewhere you\'re guilty because you have gone away. Oh, I know them! If\r\nthey could have seen their way to clap me in quod, they\'d ha\' done it.\r\nLucky I know the number of the cabman who took me to Euston before five\r\nthis morning."\r\n\r\n"If they clapped you in quod," the interviewer reported himself as\r\nfacetiously observing, "the prisoners would be on strike in a week."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but there would be so many black-legs ready to take their places,"\r\nMortlake flashed back, "that I\'m afraid it \'ould be no go. But do excuse\r\nme. I am so upset about my friend. I\'m afraid he has left England, and I\r\nhave to make inquiries; and now there\'s poor Constant gone--horrible!\r\nhorrible! and I\'m due in London at the inquest. I must really run away.\r\nGood-by. Tell your readers it\'s all a police grudge."\r\n\r\n"One last word, Mr. Mortlake, if you please. Is it true that you were\r\nbilled to preside at a great meeting of clerks at St. James\' Hall\r\nbetween one and two to-day to protest against the German invasion?"\r\n\r\n"Whew! so I had. But the beggars arrested me just before one, when I was\r\ngoing to wire, and then the news of poor Constant\'s end drove it out of\r\nmy head. What a nuisance! Lord, how troubles do come together! Well,\r\ngood-by, send me a copy of the paper."\r\n\r\nTom Mortlake\'s evidence at the inquest added little beyond this to the\r\npublic knowledge of his movements on the morning of the Mystery. The\r\ncabman who drove him to Euston had written indignantly to the papers to\r\nsay that he had picked up his celebrated fare at Bow Railway Station at\r\nabout half-past four a. m., and the arrest was a deliberate insult to\r\ndemocracy, and he offered to make an affidavit to that effect, leaving\r\nit dubious to which effect. But Scotland Yard betrayed no itch for the\r\naffidavit in question, and No. 2,138 subsided again into the obscurity\r\nof his rank. Mortlake--whose face was very pale below the black mane\r\nbrushed back from his fine forehead--gave his evidence in low,\r\nsympathetic tones. He had known the deceased for over a year, coming\r\nconstantly across him in their common political and social work, and had\r\nfound the furnished rooms for him in Glover Street at his own request,\r\nthey just being to let when Constant resolved to leave his rooms at\r\nOxford House in Bethnal Green and to share the actual life of the\r\npeople. The locality suited the deceased, as being near the People\'s\r\nPalace. He respected and admired the deceased, whose genuine goodness\r\nhad won all hearts. The deceased was an untiring worker; never grumbled,\r\nwas always in fair spirits, regarded his life and wealth as a sacred\r\ntrust to be used for the benefit of humanity. He had last seen him at a\r\nquarter past nine p. m. on the day preceding his death. He (witness) had\r\nreceived a letter by the last post which made him uneasy about a friend.\r\nDeceased was evidently suffering from toothache, and was fixing a piece\r\nof cotton-wool in a hollow tooth, but he did not complain. Deceased\r\nseemed rather upset by the news he brought, and they both discussed it\r\nrather excitedly.\r\n\r\nBy a Juryman: Did the news concern him?\r\n\r\nMortlake: Only impersonally. He knew my friend, and was keenly\r\nsympathetic when one was in trouble.\r\n\r\nCoroner: Could you show the jury the letter you received?\r\n\r\nMortlake: I have mislaid it, and cannot make out where it has got to. If\r\nyou, sir, think it relevant or essential, I will state what the trouble\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nCoroner: Was the toothache very violent?\r\n\r\nMortlake: I cannot tell. I think not, though he told me it had disturbed\r\nhis rest the night before.\r\n\r\nCoroner: What time did you leave him?\r\n\r\nMortlake: About twenty to ten.\r\n\r\nCoroner: And what did you do then?\r\n\r\nMortlake: I went out for an hour or so to make some inquiries. Then I\r\nreturned, and told my landlady I should be leaving by an early train\r\nfor--for the country.\r\n\r\nCoroner: And that was the last you saw of the deceased?\r\n\r\nMortlake (with emotion): The last.\r\n\r\nCoroner: How was he when you left him?\r\n\r\nMortlake: Mainly concerned about my trouble.\r\n\r\nCoroner: Otherwise you saw nothing unusual about him?\r\n\r\nMortlake: Nothing.\r\n\r\nCoroner: What time did you leave the house on Tuesday morning?\r\n\r\nMortlake: At about five and twenty minutes past four.\r\n\r\nCoroner: Are you sure that you shut the street door?\r\n\r\nMortlake: Quite sure. Knowing my landlady was rather a timid person, I\r\neven slipped the bolt of the big lock, which was usually tied back. It\r\nwas impossible for any one to get in even with a latch-key.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump\'s evidence (which, of course, preceded his) was more\r\nimportant, and occupied a considerable time, unduly eked out by\r\nDrabdumpian padding. Thus she not only deposed that Mr. Constant had the\r\ntoothache, but that it was going to last about a week; in tragic-comic\r\nindifference to the radical cure that had been effected. Her account of\r\nthe last hours of the deceased tallied with Mortlake\'s, only that she\r\nfeared Mortlake was quarreling with him over something in the letter\r\nthat came by the nine o\'clock post. Deceased had left the house a little\r\nafter Mortlake, but had returned before him, and had gone straight to\r\nhis bedroom. She had not actually seen him come in, having been in the\r\nkitchen, but she heard his latch-key, followed by his light step up the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nA Juryman: How do you know it was not somebody else? (Sensation, of\r\nwhich the juryman tries to look unconscious.)\r\n\r\nWitness: He called down to me over the banisters, and says in his\r\nsweetish voice: "Be hextra sure to wake me at a quarter to seven, Mrs.\r\nDrabdump, or else I shan\'t get to my tram meeting."\r\n\r\n(Juryman collapses.)\r\n\r\nCoroner: And did you wake him?\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump (breaking down): Oh, my lud, how can you ask?\r\n\r\nCoroner: There, there, compose yourself. I mean did you try to wake him?\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump: I have taken in and done for lodgers this seventeen\r\nyears, my lud, and have always gave satisfaction; and Mr. Mortlake, he\r\nwouldn\'t ha\' recommended me otherwise, though I wish to Heaven the poor\r\ngentleman had never----\r\n\r\nCoroner: Yes, yes, of course. You tried to rouse him?\r\n\r\nBut it was some time before Mrs. Drabdump was sufficiently calm to\r\nexplain that though she had overslept herself, and though it would have\r\nbeen all the same anyhow, she had come up to time. Bit by bit the tragic\r\nstory was forced from her lips--a tragedy that even her telling could\r\nnot make tawdry. She told with superfluous detail how--when Mr. Grodman\r\nbroke in the door--she saw her unhappy gentleman lodger lying on his\r\nback in bed, stone dead, with a gaping red wound in his throat; how her\r\nstronger-minded companion calmed her a little by spreading a\r\nhandkerchief over the distorted face; how they then looked vainly about\r\nand under the bed for any instrument by which the deed could have been\r\ndone, the veteran detective carefully making a rapid inventory of the\r\ncontents of the room, and taking notes of the precise position and\r\ncondition of the body before anything was disturbed by the arrival of\r\ngapers or bunglers; how she had pointed out to him that both the windows\r\nwere firmly bolted to keep out the cold night air; how, having noted\r\nthis down with a puzzled, pitying shake of the head, he had opened the\r\nwindow to summon the police, and espied in the fog one Denzil Cantercot,\r\nwhom he called and told to run to the nearest police-station and ask\r\nthem to send on an inspector and a surgeon. How they both remained in\r\nthe room till the police arrived, Grodman pondering deeply the while and\r\nmaking notes every now and again, as fresh points occurred to him, and\r\nasking her questions about the poor, weak-headed young man. Pressed as\r\nto what she meant by calling the deceased "weak-headed," she replied\r\nthat some of her neighbors wrote him begging letters, though, Heaven\r\nknew, they were better off than herself, who had to scrape her fingers\r\nto the bone for every penny she earned. Under further pressure from Mr.\r\nTalbot, who was watching the inquiry on behalf of Arthur Constant\'s\r\nfamily, Mrs. Drabdump admitted that the deceased had behaved like a\r\nhuman being, nor was there anything externally eccentric or queer in his\r\nconduct. He was always cheerful and pleasant spoken, though certainly\r\nsoft--God rest his soul. No; he never shaved, but wore all the hair that\r\nHeaven had given him.\r\n\r\nBy a Juryman: She thought deceased was in the habit of locking his door\r\nwhen he went to bed. Of course, she couldn\'t say for certain.\r\n(Laughter.) There was no need to bolt the door as well. The bolt slid\r\nupward, and was at the top of the door. When she first let lodgings, her\r\nreasons for which she seemed anxious to publish, there had only been a\r\nbolt, but a suspicious lodger, she would not call him a gentleman, had\r\ncomplained that he could not fasten his door behind him, and so she had\r\nbeen put to the expense of having a lock made. The complaining lodger\r\nwent off soon after without paying his rent. (Laughter.) She had always\r\nknown he would.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner: Was deceased at all nervous?\r\n\r\nWitness: No, he was a very nice gentleman. (A laugh.)\r\n\r\nCoroner: I mean did he seem afraid of being robbed?\r\n\r\nWitness: No, he was always goin\' to demonstrations. (Laughter.) I told\r\nhim to be careful. I told him I lost a purse with 3s. 2d. myself on\r\nJubilee Day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump resumed her seat, weeping vaguely.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner: Gentlemen, we shall have an opportunity of viewing the room\r\nshortly.\r\n\r\nThe story of the discovery of the body was retold, though more\r\nscientifically, by Mr. George Grodman, whose unexpected resurgence into\r\nthe realm of his early exploits excited as keen a curiosity as the\r\nreappearance "for this occasion only" of a retired prima donna. His\r\nbook, "Criminals I Have Caught," passed from the twenty-third to the\r\ntwenty-fourth edition merely on the strength of it. Mr. Grodman stated\r\nthat the body was still warm when he found it. He thought that death was\r\nquite recent. The door he had had to burst was bolted as well as locked.\r\nHe confirmed Mrs. Drabdump\'s statement about the windows; the chimney\r\nwas very narrow. The cut looked as if done by a razor. There was no\r\ninstrument lying about the room. He had known the deceased about a\r\nmonth. He seemed a very earnest, simple-minded young fellow who spoke a\r\ngreat deal about the brotherhood of man. (The hardened old man-hunter\'s\r\nvoice was not free from a tremor as he spoke jerkily of the dead man\'s\r\nenthusiasms.) He should have thought the deceased the last man in the\r\nworld to commit suicide.\r\n\r\nMr. Denzil Cantercot was next called. He was a poet. (Laughter.) He was\r\non his way to Mr. Grodman\'s house to tell him he had been unable to do\r\nsome writing for him because he was suffering from writer\'s cramp, when\r\nMr. Grodman called to him from the window of No. 11 and asked him to run\r\nfor the police. No, he did not run; he was a philosopher. (Laughter.) He\r\nreturned with them to the door, but did not go up. He had no stomach for\r\ncrude sensations. (Laughter.) The gray fog was sufficiently unbeautiful\r\nfor him for one morning. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nInspector Howlett said: About 9:45 on the morning of Tuesday, 4th\r\nDecember, from information received, he went with Sergeant Runnymede and\r\nDr. Robinson to 11 Glover Street, Bow, and there found the dead body of\r\na young man, lying on his back with his throat cut. The door of the room\r\nhad been smashed in, and the lock and the bolt evidently forced. The\r\nroom was tidy. There were no marks of blood on the floor. A purse full\r\nof gold was on the dressing-table beside a big book. A hip-bath with\r\ncold water stood beside the bed, over which was a hanging bookcase.\r\nThere was a large wardrobe against the wall next to the door. The\r\nchimney was very narrow. There were two windows, one bolted. It was\r\nabout 18 feet to the pavement. There was no way of climbing up. No one\r\ncould possibly have got out of the room, and then bolted the doors and\r\nwindows behind him; and he had searched all parts of the room in which\r\nanyone might have been concealed. He had been unable to find any\r\ninstrument in the room, in spite of exhaustive search, there being not\r\neven a penknife in the pockets of the clothes of the deceased, which lay\r\non a chair. The house and the back yard, and the adjacent pavement, had\r\nalso been fruitlessly searched.\r\n\r\nSergeant Runnymede made an identical statement, saving only that he had\r\ngone with Dr. Robinson and Inspector Howlett.\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson, divisional surgeon, said: The deceased was lying on his\r\nback, with his throat cut. The body was not yet cold, the abdominal\r\nregion being quite warm. Rigor mortis had set in in the lower jaw, neck\r\nand upper extremities. The muscles contracted when beaten. I inferred\r\nthat life had been extinct some two or three hours, probably not longer,\r\nit might have been less. The bedclothes would keep the lower part warm\r\nfor some time. The wound, which was a deep one, was 5-1/2 inches from\r\nright to left across the throat to a point under the left ear. The upper\r\nportion of the windpipe was severed, and likewise the jugular vein. The\r\nmuscular coating of the carotid artery was divided. There was a slight\r\ncut, as if in continuation of the wound, on the thumb of the left hand.\r\nThe hands were clasped underneath the head. There was no blood on the\r\nright hand. The wound could not have been self-inflicted. A sharp\r\ninstrument had been used, such as a razor. The cut might have been made\r\nby a left-handed person. No doubt death was practically instantaneous. I\r\nsaw no signs of a struggle about the body or the room. I noticed a purse\r\non the dressing-table, lying next to Madame Blavatsky\'s big book on\r\nTheosophy. Sergeant Runnymede drew my attention to the fact that the\r\ndoor had evidently been locked and bolted from within.\r\n\r\nBy a Juryman: I do not say the cuts could not have been made by a\r\nright-handed person. I can offer no suggestion as to how the inflicter\r\nof the wound got in or out. Extremely improbable that the cut was\r\nself-inflicted. There was little trace of the outside fog in the room.\r\n\r\nPolice Constable Williams said he was on duty in the early hours of the\r\nmorning of the 4th inst. Glover Street lay within his beat. He saw or\r\nheard nothing suspicious. The fog was never very dense, though nasty to\r\nthe throat. He had passed through Glover Street about half-past four. He\r\nhad not seen Mr. Mortlake or anybody else leave the house.\r\n\r\nThe Court here adjourned, the Coroner and the jury repairing in a body\r\nto 11 Glover Street to view the house and the bedroom of the deceased.\r\nAnd the evening posters announced, "The Bow Mystery Thickens."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the inquiry was resumed, all the poor wretches in custody had\r\nbeen released on suspicion that they were innocent; there was not a\r\nsingle case even for a magistrate. Clues, which at such seasons are\r\ngathered by the police like blackberries off the hedges, were scanty and\r\nunripe. Inferior specimens were offered them by bushels, but there was\r\nnot a good one among the lot. The police could not even manufacture a\r\nclue.\r\n\r\nArthur Constant\'s death was already the theme of every hearth, railway\r\ncarriage and public house. The dead idealist had points of contact with\r\nso many spheres. The East End and West End alike were moved and excited,\r\nthe Democratic Leagues and the Churches, the Doss-houses and the\r\nUniversities. The pity of it! And then the impenetrable mystery of it!\r\n\r\nThe evidence given in the concluding portion of the investigation was\r\nnecessarily less sensational. There were no more witnesses to bring the\r\nscent of blood over the coroner\'s table; those who had yet to be heard\r\nwere merely relatives and friends of the deceased, who spoke of him as\r\nhe had been in life. His parents were dead, perhaps luckily for them;\r\nhis relatives had seen little of him, and had scarce heard as much about\r\nhim as the outside world. No man is a prophet in his own country, and,\r\neven if he migrates, it is advisable for him to leave his family at\r\nhome. His friends were a motley crew; friends of the same friend are not\r\nnecessarily friends of one another. But their diversity only made the\r\ncongruity of the tale they had to tell more striking. It was the tale of\r\na man who had never made an enemy even by benefiting him, nor lost a\r\nfriend even by refusing his favors; the tale of a man whose heart\r\noverflowed with peace and good will to all men all the year round; of a\r\nman to whom Christmas came not once, but three hundred and sixty-five\r\ntimes a year; it was the tale of a brilliant intellect, who gave up to\r\nmankind what was meant for himself, and worked as a laborer in the\r\nvineyard of humanity, never crying that the grapes were sour; of a man\r\nuniformly cheerful and of good courage, living in that forgetfulness of\r\nself which is the truest antidote to despair. And yet there was not\r\nquite wanting the note of pain to jar the harmony and make it human.\r\nRichard Elton, his chum from boyhood, and vicar of Somerton, in\r\nMidlandshire, handed to the coroner a letter from the deceased about ten\r\ndays before his death, containing some passages which the coroner read\r\naloud: "Do you know anything of Schopenhauer? I mean anything beyond the\r\ncurrent misconceptions? I have been making his acquaintance lately. He\r\nis an agreeable rattle of a pessimist; his essay on \'The Misery of\r\nMankind\' is quite lively reading. At first his assimilation of\r\nChristianity and Pessimism (it occurs in his essay on \'Suicide\') dazzled\r\nme as an audacious paradox. But there is truth in it. Verily, the whole\r\ncreation groaneth and travaileth, and man is a degraded monster, and sin\r\nis over all. Ah, my friend, I have shed many of my illusions since I\r\ncame to this seething hive of misery and wrongdoing. What shall one\r\nman\'s life--a million men\'s lives--avail against the corruption, the\r\nvulgarity and the squalor of civilization? Sometimes I feel like a\r\nfarthing rush-light in the Hall of Eblis. Selfishness is so long and\r\nlife so short. And the worst of it is that everybody is so beastly\r\ncontented. The poor no more desire comfort than the rich culture. The\r\nwoman to whom a penny school fee for her child represents an appreciable\r\nslice of her income is satisfied that the rich we shall always have with\r\nus.\r\n\r\n"The real crusted old Tories are the paupers in the Workhouse. The\r\nRadical working men are jealous of their own leaders, and the leaders of\r\none another. Schopenhauer must have organized a labor party in his salad\r\ndays. And yet one can\'t help feeling that he committed suicide as a\r\nphilosopher by not committing it as a man. He claims kinship with\r\nBuddha, too; though Esoteric Buddhism at least seems spheres removed\r\nfrom the philosophy of \'The Will and the Idea\'. What a wonderful woman\r\nMadame Blavatsky must be. I can\'t say I follow her, for she is up in the\r\nclouds nearly all the time, and I haven\'t as yet developed an astral\r\nbody. Shall I send you on her book? It is fascinating.... I am becoming\r\nquite a fluent orator. One soon gets into the way of it. The horrible\r\nthing is that you catch yourself saying things to lead up to \'Cheers\'\r\ninstead of sticking to the plain realities of the business. Lucy is\r\nstill doing the galleries in Italy. It used to pain me sometimes to\r\nthink of my darling\'s happiness when I came across a flat-chested\r\nfactory girl. Now I feel her happiness is as important as a factory\r\ngirl\'s."\r\n\r\nLucy, the witness explained, was Lucy Brent, the betrothed of the\r\ndeceased. The poor girl had been telegraphed for, and had started for\r\nEngland. The witness stated that the outburst of despondency in this\r\nletter was almost a solitary one, most of the letters in his possession\r\nbeing bright, buoyant and hopeful. Even this letter ended with a\r\nhumorous statement of the writer\'s manifold plans and projects for the\r\nnew year. The deceased was a good Churchman.\r\n\r\nCoroner: Was there any private trouble in his own life to account for\r\nthe temporary despondency?\r\n\r\nWitness: Not so far as I am aware. His financial position was\r\nexceptionally favorable.\r\n\r\nCoroner: There had been no quarrel with Miss Brent?\r\n\r\nWitness: I have the best authority for saying that no shadow of\r\ndifference had ever come between them.\r\n\r\nCoroner: Was the deceased left-handed?\r\n\r\nWitness: Certainly not. He was not even ambidextrous.\r\n\r\nA Juryman: Isn\'t Shoppinhour one of the infidel writers, published by\r\nthe Freethought Publication Society?\r\n\r\nWitness: I do not know who publishes his books.\r\n\r\nThe Juryman (a small grocer and big raw-boned Scotchman, rejoicing in\r\nthe name of Sandy Sanderson and the dignities of deaconry and membership\r\nof the committee of the Bow Conservative Association): No equeevocation,\r\nsir. Is he not a secularist, who has lectured at the Hall of Science?\r\n\r\nWitness: No, he is a foreign writer--(Mr. Sanderson was heard to thank\r\nHeaven for this small mercy)--who believes that life is not worth\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nThe Juryman: Were you not shocked to find the friend of a meenister\r\nreading such impure leeterature?\r\n\r\nWitness: The deceased read everything. Schopenhauer is the author of a\r\nsystem of philosophy, and not what you seem to imagine. Perhaps you\r\nwould like to inspect the book? (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nThe Juryman: I would na\' touch it with a pitchfork. Such books should be\r\nburnt. And this Madame Blavatsky\'s book--what is that? Is that also\r\npheelosophy?\r\n\r\nWitness: No. It is Theosophy. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Allen Smith, secretary of the Trammel\'s Union, stated that he had\r\nhad an interview with the deceased on the day before his death, when he\r\n(the deceased) spoke hopefully of the prospects of the movement, and\r\nwrote him out a check for 10 guineas for his union. Deceased promised to\r\nspeak at a meeting called for a quarter past seven a.m. the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Wimp, of the Scotland Yard Detective Department, said that\r\nthe letters and papers of the deceased threw no light upon the manner of\r\nhis death, and they would be handed back to the family. His Department\r\nhad not formed any theory on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner proceeded to sum up the evidence. "We have to deal,\r\ngentlemen," he said, "with a most incomprehensible and mysterious case,\r\nthe details of which are yet astonishingly simple. On the morning of\r\nTuesday, the 4th inst., Mrs. Drabdump, a worthy, hard-working widow, who\r\nlets lodgings at 11 Grover Street, Bow, was unable to arouse the\r\ndeceased, who occupied the entire upper floor of the house. Becoming\r\nalarmed, she went across to fetch Mr. George Grodman, a gentleman known\r\nto us all by reputation, and to whose clear and scientific evidence we\r\nare much indebted, and got him to batter in the door. They found the\r\ndeceased lying back in bed with a deep wound in his throat. Life had\r\nonly recently become extinct. There was no trace of any instrument by\r\nwhich the cut could have been effected; there was no trace of any person\r\nwho could have effected the cut. No person could apparently have got in\r\nor out. The medical evidence goes to show that the deceased could not\r\nhave inflicted the wound himself. And yet, gentlemen, there are, in the\r\nnature of things, two--and only two--alternative explanations of his\r\ndeath. Either the wound was inflicted by his own hand, or it was\r\ninflicted by another\'s. I shall take each of these possibilities\r\nseparately. First, did the deceased commit suicide? The medical evidence\r\nsays deceased was lying with his hands clasped behind his head. Now the\r\nwound was made from right to left, and terminated by a cut on the left\r\nthumb. If the deceased had made it he would have had to do it with his\r\nright hand, while his left hand remained under his head--a most peculiar\r\nand unnatural position to assume. Moreover, in making a cut with the\r\nright hand, one would naturally move the hand from left to right. It is\r\nunlikely that the deceased would move his right hand so awkwardly and\r\nunnaturally, unless, of course, his object was to baffle suspicion.\r\nAnother point is that on this hypothesis, the deceased would have had to\r\nreplace his right hand beneath his head. But Dr. Robinson believes that\r\ndeath was instantaneous. If so, deceased could have had no time to pose\r\nso neatly. It is just possible the cut was made with the left hand, but\r\nthen the deceased was right-handed. The absence of any signs of a\r\npossible weapon undoubtedly goes to corroborate the medical evidence.\r\nThe police have made an exhaustive search in all places where the razor\r\nor other weapon or instrument might by any possibility have been\r\nconcealed, including the bedclothes, the mattress, the pillow, and the\r\nstreet into which it might have been dropped. But all theories involving\r\nthe willful concealment of the fatal instrument have to reckon with the\r\nfact or probability that death was instantaneous, also with the fact\r\nthat there was no blood about the floor. Finally, the instrument used\r\nwas in all likelihood a razor, and the deceased did not shave, and was\r\nnever known to be in possession of any such instrument. If, then, we\r\nwere to confine ourselves to the medical and police evidence, there\r\nwould, I think, be little hesitation in dismissing the idea of suicide.\r\nNevertheless, it is well to forget the physical aspect of the case for a\r\nmoment and to apply our minds to an unprejudiced inquiry into the mental\r\naspect of it. Was there any reason why the deceased should wish to take\r\nhis own life? He was young, wealthy and popular, loving and loved; life\r\nstretched fair before him. He had no vices. Plain living, high thinking,\r\nand noble doing were the three guiding stars of his life. If he had had\r\nambition, an illustrious public career was within reach. He was an\r\norator of no mean power, a brilliant and industrious man. His outlook\r\nwas always on the future--he was always sketching out ways in which he\r\ncould be useful to his fellow-men. His purse and his time were ever at\r\nthe command of whosoever could show fair claim upon them. If such a man\r\nwere likely to end his own life, the science of human nature would be at\r\nan end. Still, some of the shadows of the picture have been presented to\r\nus. The man had his moments of despondency--as which of us has not? But\r\nthey seem to have been few and passing. Anyhow, he was cheerful enough\r\non the day before his death. He was suffering, too, from toothache. But\r\nit does not seem to have been violent, nor did he complain. Possibly, of\r\ncourse, the pain became very acute in the night. Nor must we forget that\r\nhe may have overworked himself, and got his nerves into a morbid state.\r\nHe worked very hard, never rising later than half-past seven, and doing\r\nfar more than the professional \'labor leader.\' He taught and wrote as\r\nwell as spoke and organized. But on the other hand all witnesses agree\r\nthat he was looking forward eagerly to the meeting of tram-men on the\r\nmorning of the 4th inst. His whole heart was in the movement. Is it\r\nlikely that this was the night he would choose for quitting the scene of\r\nhis usefulness? Is it likely that if he had chosen it, he would not have\r\nleft letters and a statement behind, or made a last will and testament?\r\nMr. Wimp has found no possible clue to such conduct in his papers. Or is\r\nit likely he would have concealed the instrument? The only positive sign\r\nof intention is the bolting of his door in addition to the usual locking\r\nof it, but one cannot lay much stress on that. Regarding the mental\r\naspects alone, the balance is largely against suicide; looking at the\r\nphysical aspects, suicide is well nigh impossible. Putting the two\r\ntogether, the case against suicide is all but mathematically complete.\r\nThe answer, then, to our first question, Did the deceased commit\r\nsuicide? is, that he did not."\r\n\r\nThe coroner paused, and everybody drew a long breath. The lucid\r\nexposition had been followed with admiration. If the coroner had stopped\r\nnow, the jury would have unhesitatingly returned a verdict of "murder."\r\nBut the coroner swallowed a mouthful of water and went on.\r\n\r\n"We now come to the second alternative--was the deceased the victim of\r\nhomicide? In order to answer that question in the affirmative it is\r\nessential that we should be able to form some conception of the _modus\r\noperandi_. It is all very well for Dr. Robinson to say the cut was made\r\nby another hand; but in the absence of any theory as to how the cut\r\ncould possibly have been made by that other hand, we should be driven\r\nback to the theory of self-infliction, however improbable it may seem to\r\nmedical gentlemen. Now, what are the facts? When Mrs. Drabdump and Mr.\r\nGrodman found the body it was yet warm, and Mr. Grodman, a witness\r\nfortunately qualified by special experience, states that death had been\r\nquite recent. This tallies closely enough with the view of Dr. Robinson,\r\nwho, examining the body about an hour later, put the time of death at\r\ntwo or three hours before, say seven o\'clock. Mrs. Drabdump had\r\nattempted to wake the deceased at a quarter to seven, which would put\r\nback the act to a little earlier. As I understand from Dr. Robinson,\r\nthat it is impossible to fix the time very precisely, death may have\r\nvery well taken place several hours before Mrs. Drabdump\'s first attempt\r\nto wake deceased. Of course, it may have taken place between the first\r\nand second calls, as he may merely have been sound asleep at first; it\r\nmay also not impossibly have taken place considerably earlier than the\r\nfirst call, for all the physical data seem to prove. Nevertheless, on\r\nthe whole, I think we shall be least likely to err if we assume the time\r\nof death to be half-past six. Gentlemen, let us picture to ourselves No.\r\n11 Glover Street at half-past six. We have seen the house; we know\r\nexactly how it is constructed. On the ground floor a front room tenanted\r\nby Mr. Mortlake, with two windows giving on the street, both securely\r\nbolted; a back room occupied by the landlady; and a kitchen. Mrs.\r\nDrabdump did not leave her bedroom till half-past six, so that we may be\r\nsure all the various doors and windows have not yet been unfastened;\r\nwhile the season of the year is a guarantee that nothing had been left\r\nopen. The front door through which Mr. Mortlake has gone out before\r\nhalf-past four, is guarded by the latch-key lock and the big lock. On\r\nthe upper floor are two rooms--a front room used by deceased for a\r\nbedroom, and a back room which he used as a sitting-room. The back room\r\nhas been left open, with the key inside, but the window is fastened. The\r\ndoor of the front room is not only locked, but bolted. We have seen the\r\nsplintered mortise and the staple of the upper bolt violently forced\r\nfrom the woodwork and resting on the pin. The windows are bolted, the\r\nfasteners being firmly fixed in the catches. The chimney is too narrow\r\nto admit of the passage of even a child. This room, in fact, is as\r\nfirmly barred in as if besieged. It has no communication with any other\r\npart of the house. It is as absolutely self-centered and isolated as if\r\nit were a fort in the sea or a log-hut in the forest. Even if any\r\nstrange person is in the house, nay, in the very sitting-room of the\r\ndeceased, he cannot get into the bedroom, for the house is one built for\r\nthe poor, with no communication between the different rooms, so that\r\nseparate families, if need be, may inhabit each. Now, however, let us\r\ngrant that some person has achieved the miracle of getting into the\r\nfront room, first floor, 18 feet from the ground. At half-past six, or\r\nthereabouts, he cuts the throat of the sleeping occupant. How is he then\r\nto get out without attracting the attention of the now roused landlady?\r\nBut let us concede him that miracle, too. How is he to go away and yet\r\nleave the doors and windows locked and bolted from within? This is a\r\ndegree of miracle at which my credulity must draw the line. No, the room\r\nhad been closed all night--there is scarce a trace of fog in it. No one\r\ncould get in or out. Finally, murders do not take place without motive.\r\nRobbery and revenge are the only conceivable motives. The deceased had\r\nnot an enemy in the world; his money and valuables were left untouched.\r\nEverything was in order. There were no signs of a struggle. The answer\r\nthen to our second inquiry--was the deceased killed by another\r\nperson?--is, that he was not.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I am aware that this sounds impossible and contradictory.\r\nBut it is the facts that contradict themselves. It seems clear that the\r\ndeceased did not commit suicide. It seems equally clear that the\r\ndeceased was not murdered. There is nothing for it, therefore,\r\ngentlemen, but to return a verdict tantamount to an acknowledgment of\r\nour incompetence to come to any adequately grounded conviction whatever\r\nas to the means or the manner by which the deceased met his death. It is\r\nthe most inexplicable mystery in all my experience." (Sensation.)\r\n\r\nThe Foreman (after a colloquy with Mr. Sandy Sanderson): "We are not\r\nagreed, sir. One of the jurors insists on a verdict of "Death from\r\nvisitation by the act of God.""\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Sandy Sanderson\'s burning solicitude to fix the crime flickered out\r\nin the face of opposition, and in the end he bowed his head to the\r\ninevitable "open verdict." Then the floodgates of inkland were opened,\r\nand the deluge pattered for nine days on the deaf coffin where the poor\r\nidealist moldered. The tongues of the Press were loosened, and the\r\nleader writers reveled in recapitulating the circumstances of "The Big\r\nBow Mystery," though they could contribute nothing but adjectives to the\r\nsolution. The papers teemed with letters--it was a kind of Indian summer\r\nof the silly season. But the editors could not keep them out, nor cared\r\nto. The mystery was the one topic of conversation everywhere--it was on\r\nthe carpet and the bare boards alike, in the kitchen and the\r\ndrawing-room. It was discussed with science or stupidity, with aspirates\r\nor without. It came up for breakfast with the rolls, and was swept off\r\nthe supper table with the last crumbs.\r\n\r\nNo. 11 Glover Street, Bow, remained for days a shrine of pilgrimage. The\r\nonce sleepy little street buzzed from morning till night. From all parts\r\nof the town people came to stare up at the bedroom window and wonder\r\nwith a foolish look of horror. The pavement was often blocked for hours\r\ntogether, and itinerant vendors of refreshment made it a new market\r\ncenter, while vocalists hastened thither to sing the delectable ditty of\r\nthe deed without having any voice in the matter. It was a pity the\r\nGovernment did not erect a toll-gate at either end of the street. But\r\nChancellors of the Exchequer rarely avail themselves of the more obvious\r\nexpedients for paying off the National debt.\r\n\r\nFinally, familiarity bred contempt, and the wits grew facetious at the\r\nexpense of the Mystery. Jokes on the subject appeared even in the comic\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nTo the proverb, "You must not say Boo to a goose," one added, "or else\r\nshe will explain you the Mystery." The name of the gentleman who asked\r\nwhether the Bow Mystery was not \'arrowing shall not be divulged. There\r\nwas more point in "Dagonet\'s" remark that, if he had been one of the\r\nunhappy jurymen, he should have been driven to "suicide." A professional\r\nparadox-monger pointed triumphantly to the somewhat similar situation in\r\n"the murder in the Rue Morgue," and said that Nature had been\r\nplagiarizing again--like the monkey she was--and he recommended Poe\'s\r\npublishers to apply for an injunction. More seriously, Poe\'s solution\r\nwas re-suggested by "Constant Reader" as an original idea. He thought\r\nthat a small organ-grinder\'s monkey might have got down the chimney with\r\nits master\'s razor, and, after attempting to shave the occupant of the\r\nbed, have returned the way it came. This idea created considerable\r\nsensation, but a correspondent with a long train of letters draggling\r\nafter his name pointed out that a monkey small enough to get down so\r\nnarrow a flue would not be strong enough to inflict so deep a wound.\r\nThis was disputed by a third writer, and the contest raged so keenly\r\nabout the power of monkeys\' muscles that it was almost taken for granted\r\nthat a monkey was the guilty party. The bubble was pricked by the pen of\r\n"Common Sense," who laconically remarked that no traces of soot or blood\r\nhad been discovered on the floor, or on the nightshirt, or the\r\ncounterpane. The "Lancet\'s" leader on the Mystery was awaited with\r\ninterest. It said: "We cannot join in the praises that have been\r\nshowered upon the coroner\'s summing up. It shows again the evils\r\nresulting from having coroners who are not medical men. He seems to have\r\nappreciated but inadequately the significance of the medical evidence.\r\nHe should certainly have directed the jury to return a verdict of murder\r\non that. What was it to do with him that he could see no way by which\r\nthe wound could have been inflicted by an outside agency? It was for the\r\npolice to find how that was done. Enough that it was impossible for the\r\nunhappy young man to have inflicted such a wound and then have strength\r\nand will power enough to hide the instrument and to remove perfectly\r\nevery trace of his having left the bed for the purpose." It is\r\nimpossible to enumerate all the theories propounded by the amateur\r\ndetectives, while Scotland Yard religiously held its tongue. Ultimately\r\nthe interest on the subject became confined to a few papers which had\r\nreceived the best letters. Those papers that couldn\'t get interesting\r\nletters stopped the correspondence and sneered at the "sensationalism"\r\nof those that could. Among the mass of fantasy there were not a few\r\nnotable solutions, which failed brilliantly, like rockets posing as\r\nfixed stars. One was that in the obscurity of the fog the murderer had\r\nascended to the window of the bedroom by means of a ladder from the\r\npavement. He had then with a diamond cut one of the panes away, and\r\neffected an entry through the aperture. On leaving he fixed in the pane\r\nof glass again (or another which he had brought with him), and thus the\r\nroom remained with its bolts and locks untouched. On its being pointed\r\nout that the panes were too small, a third correspondent showed that\r\nthat didn\'t matter, as it was only necessary to insert the hand and undo\r\nthe fastening, when the entire window could be opened, the process being\r\nreversed by the murderer on leaving. This pretty edifice of glass was\r\nsmashed by a glazier, who wrote to say that a pane could hardly be fixed\r\nin from only one side of a window frame, that it would fall out when\r\ntouched, and that in any case the wet putty could not have escaped\r\ndetection. A door panel sliced out and replaced was also put forward,\r\nand as many trap-doors and secret passages were ascribed to No. 11\r\nGlover Street as if it were a medieval castle. Another of these clever\r\ntheories was that the murderer was in the room the whole time the police\r\nwere there--hidden in the wardrobe. Or he had got behind the door when\r\nGrodman broke it open, so that he was not noticed in the excitement of\r\nthe discovery, and escaped with his weapon at the moment when Grodman\r\nand Mrs. Drabdump were examining the window fastenings.\r\n\r\nScientific explanations also were to hand to explain how the assassin\r\nlocked and bolted the door behind him. Powerful magnets outside the door\r\nhad been used to turn the key and push the bolt within. Murderers armed\r\nwith magnets loomed on the popular imagination like a new microbe. There\r\nwas only one defect in this ingenious theory--the thing could not be\r\ndone. A physiologist recalled the conjurers who swallowed swords--by an\r\nanatomical peculiarity of the throat--and said that the deceased might\r\nhave swallowed the weapon after cutting his own throat. This was too\r\nmuch for the public to swallow. As for the idea that the suicide had\r\nbeen effected with a penknife or its blade, or a bit of steel, which had\r\ngot buried in the wound, not even the quotation of Shelley\'s line:\r\n\r\n    "Makes such a wound, the knife is lost in it,"\r\n\r\ncould secure it a moment\'s acceptance. The same reception was accorded\r\nto the idea that the cut had been made with a candlestick (or other\r\nharmless article) constructed like a sword-stick. Theories of this sort\r\ncaused a humorist to explain that the deceased had hidden the razor in\r\nhis hollow tooth! Some kind friend of Messrs. Maskelyne and Cook\r\nsuggested that they were the only persons who could have done the deed,\r\nas no one else could get out of a locked cabinet. But perhaps the most\r\nbrilliant of these flashes of false fire was the facetious, yet probably\r\nhalf-seriously meant, letter that appeared in the "Pell Mell Press"\r\nunder the heading of\r\n\r\n     THE BIG BOW MYSTERY SOLVED.\r\n\r\n     "Sir--You will remember that when the Whitechapel murders were\r\n     agitating the universe, I suggested that the district coroner was\r\n     the assassin. My suggestion has been disregarded. The coroner is\r\n     still at large. So is the Whitechapel murderer. Perhaps this\r\n     suggestive coincidence will incline the authorities to pay more\r\n     attention to me this time. The problem seems to be this. The\r\n     deceased could not have cut his own throat. The deceased could not\r\n     have had his throat cut for him. As one of the two must have\r\n     happened, this is obvious nonsense. As this is obvious nonsense I\r\n     am justified in disbelieving it. As this obvious nonsense was\r\n     primarily put in circulation by Mrs. Drabdump and Mr. Grodman, I am\r\n     justified in disbelieving them. In short, sir, what guarantee have\r\n     we that the whole tale is not a cock-and-bull story, invented by\r\n     the two persons who first found the body? What proof is there that\r\n     the deed was not done by these persons themselves, who then went to\r\n     work to smash the door and break the locks and the bolts, and\r\n     fasten up all the windows before they called the police in? I\r\n     enclose my card, and am, sir, yours truly, One Who Looks Through\r\n     His Own Spectacles."\r\n\r\n     ("Our correspondent\'s theory is not so audaciously original as he\r\n     seems to imagine. Has he not looked through the spectacles of the\r\n     people who persistently suggested that the Whitechapel murderer was\r\n     invariably the policeman who found the body? Somebody must find the\r\n     body, if it is to be found at all.--Ed. P. M. P.")\r\n\r\nThe editor had reason to be pleased that he inserted this letter, for it\r\ndrew the following interesting communication from the great detective\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n     "THE BIG BOW MYSTERY SOLVED.\r\n\r\n     "Sir--I do not agree with you that your correspondent\'s theory\r\n     lacks originality. On the contrary, I think it is delightfully\r\n     original. In fact it has given me an idea. What that idea is I do\r\n     not yet propose to say, but if \'One Who Looks Through His Own\r\n     Spectacles\' will favor me with his name and address I shall be\r\n     happy to inform him a little before the rest of the world whether\r\n     his germ has borne any fruit. I feel he is a kindred spirit, and\r\n     take this opportunity of saying publicly that I was extremely\r\n     disappointed at the unsatisfactory verdict. The thing was a\r\n     palpable assassination; an open verdict has a tendency to relax the\r\n     exertions of Scotland Yard. I hope I shall not be accused of\r\n     immodesty, or of making personal reflections, when I say that the\r\n     Department has had several notorious failures of late. It is not\r\n     what it used to be. Crime is becoming impertinent. It no longer\r\n     knows its place, so to speak. It throws down the gauntlet where\r\n     once it used to cower in its fastnesses. I repeat, I make these\r\n     remarks solely in the interest of law and order. I do not for one\r\n     moment believe that Arthur Constant killed himself, and if Scotland\r\n     Yard satisfies itself with that explanation, and turns on its other\r\n     side and goes to sleep again, then, sir, one of the foulest and\r\n     most horrible crimes of the century will forever go unpunished. My\r\n     acquaintance with the unhappy victim was but recent; still, I saw\r\n     and knew enough of the man to be certain (and I hope I have seen\r\n     and known enough of other men to judge) that he was a man\r\n     constitutionally incapable of committing an act of violence,\r\n     whether against himself or anybody else. He would not hurt a fly,\r\n     as the saying goes. And a man of that gentle stamp always lacks the\r\n     active energy to lay hands on himself. He was a man to be esteemed\r\n     in no common degree, and I feel proud to be able to say that he\r\n     considered me a friend. I am hardly at the time of life at which a\r\n     man cares to put on his harness again; but, sir, it is impossible\r\n     that I should ever know a day\'s rest till the perpetrator of this\r\n     foul deed is discovered. I have already put myself in communication\r\n     with the family of the victim, who, I am pleased to say, have every\r\n     confidence in me, and look to me to clear the name of their unhappy\r\n     relative from the semi-imputation of suicide. I shall be pleased if\r\n     anyone who shares my distrust of the authorities, and who has any\r\n     clue whatever to this terrible mystery, or any plausible suggestion\r\n     to offer, if, in brief, any \'One who looks through his own\r\n     spectacles\' will communicate with me. If I were asked to indicate\r\n     the direction in which new clues might be most usefully sought, I\r\n     should say, in the first instance, anything is valuable that helps\r\n     us to piece together a complete picture of the manifold activities\r\n     of the man in the East End. He entered one way or another into the\r\n     lives of a good many people; is it true that he nowhere made\r\n     enemies? With the best intentions a man may wound or offend; his\r\n     interference may be resented; he may even excite jealousy. A young\r\n     man like the late Mr. Constant could not have had as much practical\r\n     sagacity as he had goodness. Whose corns did he tread on? The more\r\n     we know of the last few months of his life the more we shall know\r\n     of the manner of his death. Thanking you by anticipation for the\r\n     insertion of this letter in your valuable columns, I am, sir, yours\r\n     truly,\r\n\r\n     "George Grodman.\r\n     "46 Glover Street, Bow."\r\n\r\n     "P. S.--Since writing the above lines I have, by the kindness of\r\n     Miss Brent, been placed in possession of a most valuable letter,\r\n     probably the last letter written by the unhappy gentleman. It is\r\n     dated Monday, 3 December, the very eve of the murder, and was\r\n     addressed to her at Florence, and has now, after some delay,\r\n     followed her back to London where the sad news unexpectedly brought\r\n     her. It is a letter couched, on the whole, in the most hopeful\r\n     spirit, and speaks in detail of his schemes. Of course, there are\r\n     things in it not meant for the ears of the public, but there can be\r\n     no harm in transcribing an important passage:\r\n\r\n     "\'You seem to have imbibed the idea that the East End is a kind of\r\n     Golgotha, and this despite that the books out of which you probably\r\n     got it are carefully labeled "Fiction." Lamb says somewhere that we\r\n     think of the "Dark Ages" as literally without sunlight, and so I\r\n     fancy people like you, dear, think of the "East End" as a mixture\r\n     of mire, misery and murder. How\'s that for alliteration? Why,\r\n     within five minutes\' walk of me there are the loveliest houses,\r\n     with gardens back and front, inhabited by very fine people and\r\n     furniture. Many of my university friends\' mouths would water if\r\n     they knew the income of some of the shop-keepers in the High Road.\r\n\r\n     "\'The rich people about here may not be so fashionable as those in\r\n     Kensington and Bayswater, but they are every bit as stupid and\r\n     materialistic. I don\'t deny, Lucy, I do have my black moments, and\r\n     I do sometimes pine to get away from all this to the lands of sun\r\n     and lotus-eating. But, on the whole, I am too busy even to dream of\r\n     dreaming. My real black moments are when I doubt if I am really\r\n     doing any good. But yet on the whole my conscience or my\r\n     self-conceit tells me that I am. If one cannot do much with the\r\n     mass, there is at least the consolation of doing good to the\r\n     individual. And, after all, is it not enough to have been an\r\n     influence for good over one or two human souls? There are quite\r\n     fine characters hereabout--especially in the women--natures capable\r\n     not only of self-sacrifice, but of delicacy of sentiment.

It is, no doubt, very good of him\r\n     to undertake to avenge one whom he seems snobbishly anxious to\r\n     claim as a friend; but, all things considered, should not his\r\n     letter have been headed \'The Big Bow Mystery Shelved?\' I enclose my\r\n     card, and am, sir,\r\n\r\n     "Your obedient servant,\r\n     "Scotland Yard."\r\n\r\nGeorge Grodman read this letter with annoyance, and, crumpling up the\r\npaper, murmured scornfully, "Edward Wimp."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes, but what will become of the Beautiful?" said Denzil Cantercot.\r\n\r\n"Hang the Beautiful!" said Peter Crowl, as if he were on the committee\r\nof the Academy. "Give me the True."\r\n\r\nDenzil did nothing of the sort. He didn\'t happen to have it about him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denzil Cantercot stood smoking a cigarette.]\r\n\r\nDenzil Cantercot stood smoking a cigarette in his landlord\'s shop, and\r\nimparting an air of distinction and an agreeable aroma to the close\r\nleathery atmosphere. Crowl cobbled away, talking to his tenant without\r\nraising his eyes. He was a small, big-headed, sallow, sad-eyed man, with\r\na greasy apron. Denzil was wearing a heavy overcoat with a fur collar.\r\nHe was never seen without it in public during the winter. In private he\r\nremoved it and sat in his shirt sleeves. Crowl was a thinker, or thought\r\nhe was--which seems to involve original thinking anyway. His hair was\r\nthinning rapidly at the top, as if his brain was struggling to get as\r\nnear as possible to the realities of things. He prided himself on having\r\nno fads. Few men are without some foible or hobby; Crowl felt almost\r\nlonely at times in his superiority. He was a Vegetarian, a Secularist, a\r\nBlue Ribbonite, a Republican, and an Anti-Tobacconist. Meat was a fad.\r\nDrink was a fad. Religion was a fad. Monarchy was a fad. Tobacco was a\r\nfad. "A plain man like me," Crowl used to say, "can live without fads."\r\n"A plain man" was Crowl\'s catchword. When of a Sunday morning he stood\r\non Mile-end Waste, which was opposite his shop--and held forth to the\r\ncrowd on the evils of kings, priests and mutton chops, the "plain man"\r\nturned up at intervals like the "theme" of a symphonic movement. "I am\r\nonly a plain man and I want to know." It was a phrase that sabered the\r\nspider-webs of logical refinement, and held them up scornfully on the\r\npoint. When Crowl went for a little recreation in Victoria Park on\r\nSunday afternoons, it was with this phrase that he invariably routed the\r\nsupernaturalists. Crowl knew his Bible better than most ministers, and\r\nalways carried a minutely-printed copy in his pocket, dogs-eared to mark\r\ncontradictions in the text. The second chapter of Jeremiah says one\r\nthing; the first chapter of Corinthians says another. Two contradictory\r\nstatements may both be true, but "I am only a plain man, and I want to\r\nknow." Crowl spent a large part of his time in setting "the word against\r\nthe word." Cock-fighting affords its votaries no acuter pleasure than\r\nCrowl derived from setting two texts by the ears. Crowl had a\r\nmetaphysical genius which sent his Sunday morning disciples frantic with\r\nadmiration, and struck the enemy dumb with dismay. He had discovered,\r\nfor instance, that the Deity could not move, owing to already filling\r\nall space. He was also the first to invent, for the confusion of the\r\nclerical, the crucial case of a saint dying at the Antipodes\r\ncontemporaneously with another in London. Both went skyward to heaven,\r\nyet the two traveled in directly opposite directions. In all eternity\r\nthey would never meet. Which, then, got to heaven? Or was there no such\r\nplace? "I am only a plain man, and I want to know." Preserve us our open\r\nspaces; they exist to testify to the incurable interest of humanity in\r\nthe Unknown and the Misunderstood. Even \'Arry is capable of five\r\nminutes\' attention to speculative theology, if \'Arriet isn\'t in a \'urry.\r\n\r\nPeter Crowl was not sorry to have a lodger like Denzil Cantercot, who,\r\nthough a man of parts and thus worth powder and shot, was so hopelessly\r\nwrong on all subjects under the sun. In only one point did Peter Crowl\r\nagree with Denzil Cantercot--he admired Denzil Cantercot secretly. When\r\nhe asked him for the True--which was about twice a day on the\r\naverage--he didn\'t really expect to get it from him. He knew that Denzil\r\nwas a poet.\r\n\r\n"The Beautiful," he went on, "is a thing that only appeals to men like\r\nyou. The True is for all men. The majority have the first claim. Till\r\nthen you poets must stand aside. The True and the Useful--that\'s what we\r\nwant. The Good of Society is the only test of things. Everything stands\r\nor falls by the Good of Society."\r\n\r\n"The Good of Society!" echoed Denzil, scornfully. "What\'s the Good of\r\nSociety? The Individual is before all. The mass must be sacrificed to\r\nthe Great Man. Otherwise the Great Man will be sacrificed to the mass.\r\nWithout great men there would be no art. Without art life would be a\r\nblank."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but we should fill it up with bread and butter," said Peter Crowl.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is bread and butter that kills the Beautiful," said Denzil\r\nCantercot bitterly. "Many of us start by following the butterfly through\r\nthe verdant meadows, but we turn aside----"\r\n\r\n"To get the grub," chuckled Peter, cobbling away.\r\n\r\n"Peter, if you make a jest of everything, I\'ll not waste my time on\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nDenzil\'s wild eyes flashed angrily. He shook his long hair. Life was\r\nvery serious to him. He never wrote comic verse intentionally.\r\n\r\nThere are three reasons why men of genius have long hair. One is, that\r\nthey forget it is growing. The second is, that they like it. The third\r\nis, that it comes cheaper; they wear it long for the same reason that\r\nthey wear their hats long.\r\n\r\nOwing to this peculiarity of genius, you may get quite a reputation for\r\nlack of twopence. The economic reason did not apply to Denzil, who could\r\nalways get credit with the profession on the strength of his appearance.\r\nTherefore, when street Arabs vocally commanded him to get his hair cut,\r\nthey were doing no service to barbers. Why does all the world watch over\r\nbarbers and conspire to promote their interests? Denzil would have told\r\nyou it was not to serve the barbers, but to gratify the crowd\'s\r\ninstinctive resentment of originality. In his palmy days Denzil had been\r\nan editor, but he no more thought of turning his scissors against\r\nhimself than of swallowing his paste. The efficacy of hair has changed\r\nsince the days of Samson, otherwise Denzil would have been a Hercules\r\ninstead of a long, thin, nervous man, looking too brittle and delicate\r\nto be used even for a pipe-cleaner. The narrow oval of his face sloped\r\nto a pointed, untrimmed beard. His linen was reproachable, his dingy\r\nboots were down at heel, and his cocked hat was drab with dust. Such are\r\nthe effects of a love for the Beautiful.\r\n\r\nPeter Crowl was impressed with Denzil\'s condemnation of flippancy, and\r\nhe hastened to turn off the joke.\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite serious," he said. "Butterflies are no good to nothing or\r\nnobody; caterpillars at least save the birds from starving."\r\n\r\n"Just like your view of things, Peter," said Denzil. "Good morning,\r\nmadam." This to Mrs. Crowl, to whom he removed his hat with elaborate\r\ncourtesy. Mrs. Crowl grunted and looked at her husband with a note of\r\ninterrogation in each eye. For some seconds Crowl stuck to his last,\r\nendeavoring not to see the question. He shifted uneasily on his stool.\r\nHis wife coughed grimly. He looked up, saw her towering over him, and\r\nhelplessly shook his head in a horizontal direction. It was wonderful\r\nhow Mrs. Crowl towered over Mr. Crowl, even when he stood up in his\r\nshoes. She measured half an inch less. It was quite an optical illusion.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crowl," said Mrs. Crowl, "then I\'ll tell him."\r\n\r\n"No, no, my dear, not yet," faltered Peter helplessly; "leave it to me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve left it to you long enough. You\'ll never do nothing. If it was a\r\nquestion of provin\' to a lot of chuckleheads that Jollygee and Genesis,\r\nor some other dead and gone Scripture folk that don\'t consarn no mortal\r\nsoul, used to contradict each other, your tongue \'ud run thirteen to the\r\ndozen. But when it\'s a matter of takin\' the bread out o\' the mouths o\'\r\nyour own children, you ain\'t got no more to say for yourself than a\r\nlamppost. Here\'s a man stayin\' with you for weeks and weeks--eatin\' and\r\ndrinkin\' the flesh off your bones--without payin\' a far----"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, mother; it\'s all right," said poor Crowl, red as fire.\r\n\r\nDenzil looked at her dreamily. "Is it possible you are alluding to me,\r\nMrs. Crowl?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Who then should I be alludin\' to, Mr. Cantercot? Here\'s seven weeks\r\ncome and gone, and not a blessed \'aypenny have I----"\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Crowl," said Denzil, removing his cigarette from his mouth\r\nwith a pained air, "why reproach me for your neglect?"\r\n\r\n"My neglect! I like that!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," said Denzil, more sharply. "If you had sent me in the bill\r\nyou would have had the money long ago. How do you expect me to think of\r\nthese details?"\r\n\r\n"We ain\'t so grand down here. People pays their way--they don\'t get no\r\nbills," said Mrs. Crowl, accentuating the word with infinite scorn.\r\n\r\nPeter hammered away at a nail, as though to drown his spouse\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"It\'s three pounds fourteen and eight-pence, if you\'re so anxious to\r\nknow," Mrs. Crowl resumed. "And there ain\'t a woman in the Mile End Road\r\nas \'ud a-done it cheaper, with bread at fourpence threefarden a quartern\r\nand landlords clamorin\' for rent every Monday morning almost afore the\r\nsun\'s up and folks draggin\' and slidderin\' on till their shoes is only\r\nfit to throw after brides, and Christmas comin\' and seven-pence a week\r\nfor schoolin\'!"\r\n\r\nPeter winced under the last item. He had felt it coming--like Christmas.\r\nHis wife and he parted company on the question of Free Education. Peter\r\nfelt that, having brought nine children into the world, it was only fair\r\nhe should pay a penny a week for each of those old enough to bear\r\neducating. His better half argued that, having so many children, they\r\nought in reason to be exempted. Only people who had few children could\r\nspare the penny. But the one point on which the cobbler-skeptic of the\r\nMile End Road got his way was this of the fees. It was a question of\r\nconscience, and Mrs. Crowl had never made application for their\r\nremission, though she often slapped her children in vexation instead.\r\nThey were used to slapping, and when nobody else slapped them they\r\nslapped one another. They were bright, ill-mannered brats, who pestered\r\ntheir parents and worried their teachers, and were happy as the Road was\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n"Bother the school fees!" Peter retorted, vexed. "Mr. Cantercot\'s not\r\nresponsible for your children."\r\n\r\n"I should hope not, indeed, Mr. Crowl," Mrs. Crowl said sternly. "I\'m\r\nashamed of you." And with that she flounced out of the shop into the\r\nback parlor.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right," Peter called after her soothingly. "The money\'ll be\r\nall right, mother."\r\n\r\nIn lower circles it is customary to call your wife your mother; in\r\nsomewhat superior circles it is the fashion to speak of her as "the\r\nwife" as you speak of "the Stock Exchange," or "the Thames," without\r\nclaiming any peculiar property. Instinctively men are ashamed of being\r\nmoral and domesticated.\r\n\r\nDenzil puffed his cigarette, unembarrassed. Peter bent attentively over\r\nhis work, making nervous stabs with his awl. There was a long silence.\r\nAn organ-grinder played a waltz outside, unregarded; and, failing to\r\nannoy anybody, moved on. Denzil lit another cigarette. The dirty-faced\r\nclock on the shop wall chimed twelve.\r\n\r\n"What do you think," said Crowl, "of Republics?"\r\n\r\n"They are low," Denzil replied. "Without a Monarch there is no visible\r\nincarnation of Authority."\r\n\r\n"What! do you call Queen Victoria visible?"\r\n\r\n"Peter, do you want to drive me from the house? Leave frivolousness to\r\nwomen, whose minds are only large enough for domestic difficulties.\r\nRepublics are low. Plato mercifully kept the poets out of his. Republics\r\nare not congenial soil for poetry."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense! If England dropped its fad of Monarchy and became a\r\nRepublic to-morrow, do you mean to say that----?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to say that there would be no Poet Laureate to begin with."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s fribbling now, you or me, Cantercot? But I don\'t care a\r\nbutton-hook about poets, present company always excepted. I\'m only a\r\nplain man, and I want to know where\'s the sense of givin\' any one person\r\nauthority over everybody else?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s what Tom Mortlake used to say. Wait till you\'re in power,\r\nPeter, with trade-union money to control, and working men bursting to\r\ngive you flying angels and to carry you aloft, like a banner,\r\nhuzzahing."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s because he\'s head and shoulders above \'em already," said\r\nCrowl, with a flash in his sad gray eyes. "Still, it don\'t prove that\r\nI\'d talk any different. And I think you\'re quite wrong about his being\r\nspoiled. Tom\'s a fine fellow--a man every inch of him, and that\'s a good\r\nmany. I don\'t deny he has his weaknesses, and there was a time when he\r\nstood in this very shop and denounced that poor dead Constant. \'Crowl,\'\r\nsaid he, \'that man\'ll do mischief. I don\'t like these kid-glove\r\nphilanthropists mixing themselves up in practical labor disputes they\r\ndon\'t understand.\'"\r\n\r\nDenzil whistled involuntarily. It was a piece of news.\r\n\r\n"I daresay," continued Crowl, "he\'s a bit jealous of anybody\'s\r\ninterference with his influence. But in this case the jealousy did wear\r\noff, you see, for the poor fellow and he got quite pals, as everybody\r\nknows. Tom\'s not the man to hug a prejudice. However, all that don\'t\r\nprove nothing against Republics. Look at the Czar and the Jews. I\'m only\r\na plain man, but I wouldn\'t live in Russia not for--not for all the\r\nleather in it! An Englishman, taxed as he is to keep up his Fad of\r\nMonarchy, is at least king in his own castle, whoever bosses it at\r\nWindsor. Excuse me a minute, the missus is callin\'."\r\n\r\n"Excuse _me_ a minute. I\'m going, and I want to say before I go--I feel\r\nit is only right you should know at once--that after what has passed\r\nto-day I can never be on the same footing here as in the--shall I say\r\npleasant?--days of yore."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Cantercot. Don\'t say that; don\'t say that!" pleaded the little\r\ncobbler.\r\n\r\n"Well, shall I say unpleasant, then?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, Cantercot. Don\'t misunderstand me. Mother has been very much\r\nput to it lately to rub along. You see she has such a growing family. It\r\ngrows--daily. But never mind her. You pay whenever you\'ve got the\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\nDenzil shook his head. "It cannot be. You know when I came here first I\r\nrented your top room and boarded myself. Then I learnt to know you. We\r\ntalked together. Of the Beautiful. And the Useful. I found you had no\r\nsoul. But you were honest, and I liked you. I went so far as to take my\r\nmeals with your family. I made myself at home in your back parlor. But\r\nthe vase has been shattered (I do not refer to that on the mantelpiece),\r\nand though the scent of the roses may cling to it still, it can be\r\npieced together--nevermore." He shook his hair sadly and shambled out of\r\nthe shop. Crowl would have gone after him, but Mrs. Crowl was still\r\ncalling, and ladies must have the precedence in all polite societies.\r\n\r\nCantercot went straight--or as straight as his loose gait permitted--to\r\n46 Glover Street, and knocked at the door. Grodman\'s factotum opened it.\r\nShe was a pock-marked person, with a brickdust complexion and a\r\ncoquettish manner.\r\n\r\n"Oh, here we are again!" she said vivaciously.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk like a clown," Cantercot snapped. "Is Mr. Grodman in?"\r\n\r\n"No, you\'ve put him out," growled the gentleman himself, suddenly\r\nappearing in his slippers. "Come in. What the devil have you been doing\r\nwith yourself since the inquest? Drinking again?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve sworn off. Haven\'t touched a drop since----"\r\n\r\n"The murder?"\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said Denzil Cantercot, startled. "What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"What I say. Since December 4, I reckon everything from that murder,\r\nnow, as they reckon longitude from Greenwich."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Denzil Cantercot.\r\n\r\n"Let me see. Nearly a fortnight. What a long time to keep away from\r\nDrink--and Me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know which is worse," said Denzil, irritated. "You both steal\r\naway my brains."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" said Grodman, with an amused smile. "Well, it\'s only petty\r\npilfering, after all. What\'s put salt on your wounds?"\r\n\r\n"The twenty-fourth edition of my book."\r\n\r\n"Whose book?"\r\n\r\n"Well, your book. You must be making piles of money out of \'Criminals I\r\nHave Caught.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'Criminals _I_ Have Caught,\'" corrected Grodman. "My dear Denzil, how\r\noften am I to point out that I went through the experiences that make\r\nthe backbone of my book, not you? In each case I cooked the criminal\'s\r\ngoose. Any journalist could have supplied the dressing."\r\n\r\n"The contrary. The journeymen of journalism would have left the truth\r\nnaked. You yourself could have done that--for there is no man to beat\r\nyou at cold, lucid, scientific statement. But I idealized the bare facts\r\nand lifted them into the realm of poetry and literature. The\r\ntwenty-fourth edition of the book attests my success."\r\n\r\n"Rot! The twenty-fourth edition was all owing to the murder! Did you do\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"You take one up so sharply, Mr. Grodman," said Denzil, changing his\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"No--I\'ve retired," laughed Grodman.\r\n\r\nDenzil did not reprove the ex-detective\'s flippancy. He even laughed a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n"Well, give me another fiver, and I\'ll cry \'quits.\' I\'m in debt."\r\n\r\n"Not a penny. Why haven\'t you been to see me since the murder? I had to\r\nwrite that letter to the \'Pell Mell Press\' myself. You might have earned\r\na crown."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had writer\'s cramp, and couldn\'t do your last job. I was coming to\r\ntell you so on the morning of the----"\r\n\r\n"Murder. So you said at the inquest."\r\n\r\n"It\'s true."\r\n\r\n"Of course. Weren\'t you on your oath? It was very zealous of you to get\r\nup so early to tell me. In which hand did you have this cramp?"\r\n\r\n"Why, in the right, of course."\r\n\r\n"And you couldn\'t write with your left?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I could even hold a pen."\r\n\r\n"Or any other instrument, mayhap. What had you been doing to bring it\r\non?"\r\n\r\n"Writing too much. That is the only possible cause."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. Writing what?"\r\n\r\nDenzil hesitated. "An epic poem."\r\n\r\n"No wonder you\'re in debt. Will a sovereign get you out of it?"\r\n\r\n"No; it wouldn\'t be the least use to me."\r\n\r\n"Here it is, then."\r\n\r\nDenzil took the coin and his hat.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to earn it, you beggar? Sit down and write something\r\nfor me."\r\n\r\nDenzil got pen and paper, and took his place.\r\n\r\n"What do you want me to write?"\r\n\r\n"The Epic Poem."\r\n\r\nDenzil started and flushed. But he set to work. Grodman leaned back in\r\nhis armchair and laughed, studying the poet\'s grave face.\r\n\r\nDenzil wrote three lines and paused.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t remember any more? Well, read me the start."\r\n\r\nDenzil read:\r\n\r\n    "Of man\'s first disobedience and the fruit\r\n    Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste\r\n      Brought death into the world--"\r\n\r\n"Hold on!" cried Grodman; "what morbid subjects you choose, to be sure."\r\n\r\n"Morbid! Why, Milton chose the same subject!"\r\n\r\n"Blow Milton. Take yourself off--you and your Epics."\r\n\r\nDenzil went. The pock-marked person opened the street door for him.\r\n\r\n"When am I to have that new dress, dear?" she whispered coquettishly.\r\n\r\n"I have no money, Jane," he said shortly.\r\n\r\n"You have a sovereign."\r\n\r\nDenzil gave her the sovereign, and slammed the door viciously. Grodman\r\noverheard their whispers, and laughed silently. His hearing was acute.\r\nJane had first introduced Denzil to his acquaintance about two years\r\nago, when he spoke of getting an amanuensis, and the poet had been doing\r\nodd jobs for him ever since. Grodman argued that Jane had her reasons.\r\nWithout knowing them he got a hold over both. There was no one, he felt,\r\nhe could not get a hold over. All men--and women--have something to\r\nconceal, and you have only to pretend to know what it is. Thus Grodman,\r\nwho was nothing if not scientific.\r\n\r\nDenzil Cantercot shambled home thoughtfully, and abstractedly took his\r\nplace at the Crowl dinner-table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Crowl surveyed Denzil Cantercot so stonily and cut him his beef so\r\nsavagely that he said grace when the dinner was over. Peter fed his\r\nmetaphysical genius on tomatoes. He was tolerant enough to allow his\r\nfamily to follow their Fads; but no savory smells ever tempted him to be\r\nfalse to his vegetable loves. Besides, meat might have reminded him too\r\nmuch of his work. There is nothing like leather, but Bow beefsteaks\r\noccasionally come very near it.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Denzil usually indulged in poetic reverie. But to-day he\r\ndid not take his nap. He went out at once to "raise the wind." But there\r\nwas a dead calm everywhere. In vain he asked for an advance at the\r\noffice of the "Mile End Mirror," to which he contributed scathing\r\nleaderettes about vestrymen. In vain he trudged to the city and offered\r\nto write the "Ham and Eggs Gazette" an essay on the modern methods of\r\nbacon-curing. Denzil knew a great deal about the breeding and\r\nslaughtering of pigs, smoke-lofts and drying processes, having for years\r\ndictated the policy of the "New Pork Herald" in these momentous matters.\r\nDenzil also knew a great deal about many other esoteric matters,\r\nincluding weaving machines, the manufacture of cabbage leaves and snuff,\r\nand the inner economy of drain-pipes. He had written for the trade\r\npapers since boyhood. But there is great competition on these papers. So\r\nmany men of literary gifts know all about the intricate technicalities\r\nof manufactures and markets, and are eager to set the trade right.\r\nGrodman perhaps hardly allowed sufficiently for the step backward that\r\nDenzil made when he devoted his whole time for months to "Criminals I\r\nHave Caught." It was as damaging as a debauch. For when your rivals are\r\npushing forward, to stand still is to go back.\r\n\r\nIn despair Denzil shambled toilsomely to Bethnal Green. He paused before\r\nthe window of a little tobacconist\'s shop, wherein was displayed a\r\nplacard announcing\r\n\r\n     "PLOTS FOR SALE."\r\n\r\nThe announcement went on to state that a large stock of plots was to be\r\nobtained on the premises--embracing sensational plots, humorous plots,\r\nlove plots, religious plots, and poetic plots; also complete\r\nmanuscripts, original novels, poems and tales. Apply within.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dirty-looking shop, with begrimed bricks and blackened\r\nwoodwork. The window contained some musty old books, an assortment of\r\npipes and tobacco, and a large number of the vilest daubs unhung,\r\npainted in oil on Academy boards, and unframed. These were intended for\r\nlandscapes, as you could tell from the titles. The most expensive was\r\n"Chingford Church," and it was marked 1s. 9d. The others ran from 6d. to\r\n1s. 3d., and were mostly representations of Scotch scenery--a loch with\r\nmountains in the background, with solid reflections in the water and a\r\ntree in the foreground. Sometimes the tree would be in the background.\r\nThen the loch would be in the foreground. Sky and water were intensely\r\nblue in all. The name of the collection was "Original oil paintings done\r\nby hand." Dust lay thick upon everything, as if carefully shoveled on;\r\nand the proprietor looked as if he slept in his shop window at night\r\nwithout taking his clothes off. He was a gaunt man with a red nose, long\r\nbut scanty black locks covered by a smoking cap, and a luxuriant black\r\nmustache. He smoked a long clay pipe, and had the air of a broken-down\r\noperatic villain.\r\n\r\n"Ah, good afternoon, Mr. Cantercot," he said, rubbing his hands, half\r\nfrom cold, half from usage; "what have you brought me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Denzil, "but if you will lend me a sovereign I\'ll do you\r\na stunner."\r\n\r\nThe operatic villain shook his locks, his eyes full of pawky cunning.\r\n"If you did it after that it would be a stunner."\r\n\r\nWhat the operatic villain did with these plots, and who bought them,\r\nCantercot never knew nor cared to know. Brains are cheap to-day, and\r\nDenzil was glad enough to find a customer.\r\n\r\n"Surely you\'ve known me long enough to trust me," he cried.\r\n\r\n"Trust is dead," said the operatic villain, puffing away.\r\n\r\n"So is Queen Anne," cried the irritated poet. His eyes took a dangerous\r\nhunted look. Money he must have. But the operatic villain was\r\ninflexible. No plot, no supper.\r\n\r\nPoor Denzil went out flaming. He knew not where to turn. Temporarily he\r\nturned on his heel again and stared despairingly at the shop window.\r\nAgain he read the legend:\r\n\r\n     "PLOTS FOR SALE."\r\n\r\nHe stared so long at this that it lost its meaning. When the sense of\r\nthe words suddenly flashed upon him again, they bore a new significance.\r\nHe went in meekly, and borrowed fourpence of the operatic villain. Then\r\nhe took the \'bus for Scotland Yard. There was a not ill-looking servant\r\ngirl in the \'bus. The rhythm of the vehicle shaped itself into rhymes in\r\nhis brain. He forgot all about his situation and his object. He had\r\nnever really written an epic--except "Paradise Lost"--but he composed\r\nlyrics about wine and women and often wept to think how miserable he\r\nwas. But nobody ever bought anything of him, except articles on\r\nbacon-curing or attacks on vestrymen. He was a strange, wild creature,\r\nand the wench felt quite pretty under his ardent gaze. It almost\r\nhypnotized her, though, and she looked down at her new French kid boots\r\nto escape it.\r\n\r\nAt Scotland Yard Denzil asked for Edward Wimp. Edward Wimp was not on\r\nview. Like kings and editors, Detectives are difficult of\r\napproach--unless you are a criminal, when you cannot see anything of\r\nthem at all. Denzil knew of Edward Wimp, principally because of\r\nGrodman\'s contempt for his successor. Wimp was a man of taste and\r\nculture. Grodman\'s interests were entirely concentrated on the problems\r\nof logic and evidence. Books about these formed his sole reading; for\r\n_belles lettres_ he cared not a straw. Wimp, with his flexible\r\nintellect, had a great contempt for Grodman and his slow, laborious,\r\nponderous, almost Teutonic methods. Worse, he almost threatened to\r\neclipse the radiant tradition of Grodman by some wonderfully ingenious\r\nbits of workmanship. Wimp was at his greatest in collecting\r\ncircumstantial evidence; in putting two and two together to make five.\r\nHe would collect together a number of dark and disconnected data and\r\nflash across them the electric light of some unifying hypothesis in a\r\nway which would have done credit to a Darwin or a Faraday. An intellect\r\nwhich might have served to unveil the secret workings of nature was\r\nsubverted to the protection of a capitalistic civilization.\r\n\r\nBy the assistance of a friendly policeman, whom the poet magnetized into\r\nthe belief that his business was a matter of life and death, Denzil\r\nobtained the great detective\'s private address. It was near King\'s\r\nCross. By a miracle Wimp was at home in the afternoon. He was writing\r\nwhen Denzil was ushered up three pairs of stairs into his presence, but\r\nhe got up and flashed the bull\'s-eye of his glance upon the visitor.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Denzil Cantercot, I believe!" said Wimp.\r\n\r\nDenzil started. He had not sent up his name, merely describing himself\r\nas a gentleman.\r\n\r\n"That is my name," he murmured.\r\n\r\n"You were one of the witnesses at the inquest on the body of the late\r\nArthur Constant. I have your evidence there." He pointed to a file. "Why\r\nhave you come to give fresh evidence?"\r\n\r\nAgain Denzil started, flushing in addition this time. "I want money," he\r\nsaid, almost involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"Sit down." Denzil sat. Wimp stood.\r\n\r\nWimp was young and fresh-colored. He had a Roman nose, and was smartly\r\ndressed. He had beaten Grodman by discovering the wife Heaven meant for\r\nhim. He had a bouncing boy, who stole jam out of the pantry without\r\nanyone being the wiser. Wimp did what work he could do at home in a\r\nsecluded study at the top of the house. Outside his chamber of horrors\r\nhe was the ordinary husband of commerce. He adored his wife, who thought\r\npoorly of his intellect, but highly of his heart. In domestic\r\ndifficulties Wimp was helpless. He could not even tell whether the\r\nservant\'s "character" was forged or genuine. Probably he could not level\r\nhimself to such petty problems. He was like the senior wrangler who has\r\nforgotten how to do quadratics, and has to solve equations of the second\r\ndegree by the calculus.\r\n\r\n"How much money do you want?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I do not make bargains," Denzil replied, his calm come back by this\r\ntime. "I came to tender you a suggestion. It struck me that you might\r\noffer me a fiver for my trouble. Should you do so, I shall not refuse\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You shall not refuse it--if you deserve it."\r\n\r\n"Good. I will come to the point at once. My suggestion concerns--Tom\r\nMortlake."\r\n\r\nDenzil threw out the name as if it were a torpedo. Wimp did not move.\r\n\r\n"Tom Mortlake," went on Denzil, looking disappointed, "had a\r\nsweetheart." He paused impressively.\r\n\r\nWimp said "Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Where is that sweetheart now?"\r\n\r\n"Where, indeed?"\r\n\r\n"You know about her disappearance?"\r\n\r\n"You have just informed me of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is gone--without a trace. She went about a fortnight before\r\nMr. Constant\'s murder."\r\n\r\n"Murder? How do you know it was a murder?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Grodman says so," said Denzil, startled again.\r\n\r\n"H\'m! Isn\'t that rather a proof that it was suicide? Well, go on."\r\n\r\n"About a fortnight before the suicide, Jessie Dymond disappeared. So\r\nthey tell me in Stepney Green, where she lodged and worked."\r\n\r\n"What was she?"\r\n\r\n"She was a dressmaker. She had a wonderful talent. Quite fashionable\r\nladies got to know of it. One of her dresses was presented at Court. I\r\nthink the lady forgot to pay for it; so Jessie\'s landlady said."\r\n\r\n"Did she live alone?"\r\n\r\n"She had no parents, but the house was respectable."\r\n\r\n"Good-looking, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"As a poet\'s dream."\r\n\r\n"As yours, for instance?"\r\n\r\n"I am a poet; I dream."\r\n\r\n"You dream you are a poet. Well, well! She was engaged to Mortlake?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! They made no secret of it. The engagement was an old one. When\r\nhe was earning 36s. a week as a compositor they were saving up to buy a\r\nhome. He worked at Railton and Hockes\', who print the \'New Pork Herald.\'\r\nI used to take my \'copy\' into the comps\' room, and one day the Father of\r\nthe Chapel told me all about \'Mortlake and his young woman.\' Ye gods!\r\nHow times are changed! Two years ago Mortlake had to struggle with my\r\ncaligraphy--now he is in with all the nobs, and goes to the \'at homes\'\r\nof the aristocracy."\r\n\r\n"Radical M. P.\'s," murmured Wimp, smiling.\r\n\r\n"While I am still barred from the dazzling drawing-rooms, where beauty\r\nand intellect foregather. A mere artisan! A manual laborer!" Denzil\'s\r\neyes flashed angrily. He rose with excitement. "They say he always was a\r\njabberer in the composing-room, and he has jabbered himself right out of\r\nit and into a pretty good thing. He didn\'t have much to say about the\r\ncrimes of capital when he was set up to second the toast of \'Railton and\r\nHockes\' at the beanfeast."\r\n\r\n"Toast and butter, toast and butter," said Wimp genially. "I shouldn\'t\r\nblame a man for serving the two together, Mr. Cantercot."\r\n\r\nDenzil forced a laugh. "Yes; but consistency\'s my motto. I like to see\r\nthe royal soul immaculate, unchanging, immovable by fortune. Anyhow,\r\nwhen better times came for Mortlake the engagement still dragged on. He\r\ndid not visit her so much. This last autumn he saw very little of her."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"I--I was often in Stepney Green. My business took me past the house of\r\nan evening. Sometimes there was no light in her room. That meant she was\r\ndownstairs gossiping with the landlady."\r\n\r\n"She might have been out with Tom?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I knew Tom was on the platform somewhere or other. He was\r\nworking up to all hours organizing the eight hours working movement."\r\n\r\n"A very good reason for relaxing his sweethearting."\r\n\r\n"It was. He never went to Stepney Green on a week night."\r\n\r\n"But you always did."\r\n\r\n"No--not every night."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t go in?"\r\n\r\n"Never. She wouldn\'t permit my visits. She was a girl of strong\r\ncharacter. She always reminded me of Flora Macdonald."\r\n\r\n"Another lady of your acquaintance?"\r\n\r\n"A lady I know better than the shadows who surround me; who is more real\r\nto me than the women who pester me for the price for apartments. Jessie\r\nDymond, too, was of the race of heroines. Her eyes were clear blue, two\r\nwells with Truth at the bottom of each. When I looked into those eyes my\r\nown were dazzled. They were the only eyes I could never make dreamy." He\r\nwaved his hand as if making a pass with it. "It was she who had the\r\ninfluence over me."\r\n\r\n"You knew her then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I knew Tom from the old \'New Pork Herald\' days, and when I\r\nfirst met him with Jessie hanging on his arm he was quite proud to\r\nintroduce her to a poet. When he got on he tried to shake me off."\r\n\r\n"You should have repaid him what you borrowed."\r\n\r\n"It--it--was only a trifle," stammered Denzil.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but the world turns on trifles," said the wise Wimp.\r\n\r\n"The world is itself a trifle," said the pensive poet. "The Beautiful\r\nalone is deserving of our regard."\r\n\r\n"And when the Beautiful was not gossiping with her landlady, did she\r\ngossip with you as you passed the door?"\r\n\r\n"Alas, no! She sat in her room reading, and cast a shadow--"\r\n\r\n"On your life?"\r\n\r\n"No; on the blind."\r\n\r\n"Always one shadow?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. Once or twice, two."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you had been drinking."\r\n\r\n"On my life, not. I have sworn off the treacherous wine-cup."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. Beer is bad for poets. It makes their feet shaky. Whose\r\nwas the second shadow?"\r\n\r\n"A man\'s."\r\n\r\n"Naturally. Mortlake\'s, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible. He was still striking eight hours."\r\n\r\n"You found out whose? You didn\'t leave it a shadow of doubt?"\r\n\r\n"No; I waited till the substance came out."\r\n\r\n"It was Arthur Constant."\r\n\r\n"You are a magician! You--you terrify me. Yes, it was he."\r\n\r\n"Only once or twice, you say?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t keep watch over them."\r\n\r\n"No, no, of course not. You only passed casually. I understand you\r\nthoroughly."\r\n\r\nDenzil did not feel comfortable at the assertion.\r\n\r\n"What did he go there for?" Wimp went on.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I\'d stake my soul on Jessie\'s honor."\r\n\r\n"You might double your stake without risk."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I might! I would! You see her with my eyes."\r\n\r\n"For the moment they are the only ones available. When was the last time\r\nyou saw the two together?"\r\n\r\n"About the middle of November."\r\n\r\n"Mortlake knew nothing of their meetings?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Perhaps he did. Mr. Constant had probably enlisted her in\r\nhis social mission work. I knew she was one of the attendants at the big\r\nchildren\'s tea in the Great Assembly Hall early in November. He treated\r\nher quite like a lady. She was the only attendant who worked with her\r\nhands."\r\n\r\n"The others carried the cups on their feet, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"No; how could that be? My meaning is that all the other attendants were\r\nreal ladies, and Jessie was only an amateur, so to speak. There was no\r\nnovelty for her in handing kids cups of tea. I daresay she had helped\r\nher landlady often enough at that--there\'s quite a bushel of brats below\r\nstairs. It\'s almost as bad as at friend Crowl\'s. Jessie was a real\r\nbrick. But perhaps Tom didn\'t know her value. Perhaps he didn\'t like\r\nConstant to call on her, and it led to a quarrel. Anyhow, she\'s\r\ndisappeared, like the snowfall on the river. There\'s not a trace. The\r\nlandlady, who was such a friend of hers that Jessie used to make up her\r\nstuff into dresses for nothing, tells me that she\'s dreadfully annoyed\r\nat not having been left the slightest clue to her late tenant\'s\r\nwhereabouts."\r\n\r\n"You have been making inquiries on your own account apparently."\r\n\r\n"Only of the landlady. Jessie never even gave her the week\'s notice, but\r\npaid her in lieu of it, and left immediately. The landlady told me I\r\ncould have knocked her down with a feather. Unfortunately, I wasn\'t\r\nthere to do it, for I should certainly have knocked her down for not\r\nkeeping her eyes open better. She says if she had only had the least\r\nsuspicion beforehand that the minx (she dared to call Jessie a minx) was\r\ngoing, she\'d have known where, or her name would have been somebody\r\nelse\'s. And yet she admits that Jessie was looking ill and worried.\r\nStupid old hag!"\r\n\r\n"A woman of character," murmured the detective.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you so?" cried Denzil eagerly. "Another girl would have\r\nlet out that she was going. But, no! not a word. She plumped down the\r\nmoney and walked out. The landlady ran upstairs. None of Jessie\'s things\r\nwere there. She must have quietly sold them off, or transferred them to\r\nthe new place. I never in my life met a girl who so thoroughly knew her\r\nown mind or had a mind so worth knowing. She always reminded me of the\r\nMaid of Saragossa."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! And when did she leave?"\r\n\r\n"On the 19th of November."\r\n\r\n"Mortlake of course knows where she is?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say. Last time I was at the house to inquire--it was at the end\r\nof November--he hadn\'t been seen there for six weeks. He wrote to her,\r\nof course, sometimes--the landlady knew his writing."\r\n\r\nWimp looked Denzil straight in the eyes, and said, "You mean, of course,\r\nto accuse Mortlake of the murder of Mr. Constant?"\r\n\r\n"N-n-no, not at all," stammered Denzil, "only you know what Mr. Grodman\r\nwrote to the \'Pell Mell.\' The more we know about Mr. Constant\'s life the\r\nmore we shall know about the manner of his death. I thought my\r\ninformation would be valuable to you, and I brought it."\r\n\r\n"And why didn\'t you take it to Mr. Grodman?"\r\n\r\n"Because I thought it wouldn\'t be valuable to me."\r\n\r\n"You wrote \'Criminals I Have Caught.\'"\r\n\r\n"How--how do you know that?" Wimp was startling him to-day with a\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\n"Your style, my dear Mr. Cantercot. The unique noble style."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was afraid it would betray me," said Denzil. "And since you\r\nknow, I may tell you that Grodman\'s a mean curmudgeon. What does he want\r\nwith all that money and those houses--a man with no sense of the\r\nBeautiful? He\'d have taken my information, and given me more kicks than\r\nha\'pence for it, so to speak."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is a shrewd man after all. I don\'t see anything valuable in\r\nyour evidence against Mortlake."\r\n\r\n"No!" said Denzil in a disappointed tone, and fearing he was going to be\r\nrobbed. "Not when Mortlake was already jealous of Mr. Constant, who was\r\na sort of rival organizer, unpaid! A kind of blackleg doing the work\r\ncheaper--nay, for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Did Mortlake tell you he was jealous?" said Wimp, a shade of sarcastic\r\ncontempt piercing through his tones.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! He said to me, \'That man will work mischief. I don\'t like your\r\nkid-glove philanthropists meddling in matters they don\'t understand.\'"\r\n\r\n"Those were his very words?"\r\n\r\n"His _ipsissima verba_."\r\n\r\n"Very well. I have your address in my files. Here is a sovereign for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Only one sovereign! It\'s not the least use to me."\r\n\r\n"Very well. It\'s of great use to me. I have a wife to keep."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t," said Denzil with a sickly smile, "so perhaps I can manage\r\non it after all." He took his hat and the sovereign.\r\n\r\nOutside the door he met a rather pretty servant just bringing in some\r\ntea to her master. He nearly upset her tray at sight of her. She seemed\r\nmore amused at the _rencontre_ than he.\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon, dear," she said coquettishly. "You might let me have\r\nthat sovereign. I do so want a new Sunday bonnet."\r\n\r\nDenzil gave her the sovereign, and slammed the hall door viciously when\r\nhe got to the bottom of the stairs. He seemed to be walking arm-in-arm\r\nwith the long arm of coincidence. Wimp did not hear the duologue. He was\r\nalready busy on his evening\'s report to headquarters. The next day\r\nDenzil had a body-guard wherever he went. It might have gratified his\r\nvanity had he known it. But to-night he was yet unattended, so no one\r\nnoted that he went to 46 Glover Street, after the early Crowl supper. He\r\ncould not help going. He wanted to get another sovereign. He also itched\r\nto taunt Grodman. Not succeeding in the former object, he felt the road\r\nopen for the second.\r\n\r\n"Do you still hope to discover the Bow murderer?" he asked the old\r\nbloodhound.\r\n\r\n"I can lay my hand on him now," Grodman announced curtly.\r\n\r\nDenzil hitched his chair back involuntarily. He found conversation with\r\ndetectives as lively as playing at skittles with bombshells. They got on\r\nhis nerves terribly, these undemonstrative gentlemen with no sense of\r\nthe Beautiful.\r\n\r\n"But why don\'t you give him up to justice?" he murmured.\r\n\r\n"Ah--it has to be proved yet. But it is only a matter of time."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Denzil, "and shall I write the story for you?"\r\n\r\n"No. You will not live long enough."\r\n\r\nDenzil turned white. "Nonsense! I am years younger than you," he gasped.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Grodman, "but you drink so much."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Wimp invited Grodman to eat his Christmas plum-pudding at King\'s\r\nCross Grodman was only a little surprised. The two men were always\r\noverwhelmingly cordial when they met, in order to disguise their mutual\r\ndetestation. When people really like each other, they make no\r\nconcealment of their mutual contempt. In his letter to Grodman, Wimp\r\nsaid that he thought it would be nicer for him to keep Christmas in\r\ncompany than in solitary state. There seems to be a general prejudice in\r\nfavor of Christmas numbers, and Grodman yielded to it. Besides, he\r\nthought that a peep at the Wimp domestic interior would be as good as a\r\npantomime. He quite enjoyed the fun that was coming, for he knew that\r\nWimp had not invited him out of mere "peace and goodwill."\r\n\r\nThere was only one other guest at the festive board. This was Wimp\'s\r\nwife\'s mother\'s mother, a lady of sweet seventy. Only a minority of\r\nmankind can obtain a grandmother-in-law by marrying, but Wimp was not\r\nunduly conceited. The old lady suffered from delusions. One of them was\r\nthat she was a centenarian. She dressed for the part. It is\r\nextraordinary what pains ladies will take to conceal their age. Another\r\nof Wimp\'s grandmother-in-law\'s delusions was that Wimp had married to\r\nget her into the family. Not to frustrate his design, she always gave\r\nhim her company on high-days and holidays. Wilfred Wimp--the little boy\r\nwho stole the jam--was in great form at the Christmas dinner. The only\r\ndrawback to his enjoyment was that its sweets needed no stealing. His\r\nmother presided over the platters, and thought how much cleverer Grodman\r\nwas than her husband. When the pretty servant who waited on them was\r\nmomentarily out of the room, Grodman had remarked that she seemed very\r\ninquisitive. This coincided with Mrs. Wimp\'s own convictions, though Mr.\r\nWimp could never be brought to see anything unsatisfactory or suspicious\r\nabout the girl, not even though there were faults in spelling in the\r\n"character" with which her last mistress had supplied her.\r\n\r\nIt was true that the puss had pricked up her ears when Denzil\r\nCantercot\'s name was mentioned. Grodman saw it and watched her, and\r\nfooled Wimp to the top of his bent. It was, of course, Wimp who\r\nintroduced the poet\'s name, and he did it so casually that Grodman\r\nperceived at once that he wished to pump him. The idea that the rival\r\nbloodhound should come to him for confirmation of suspicions against his\r\nown pet jackal was too funny. It was almost as funny to Grodman that\r\nevidence of some sort should be obviously lying to hand in the bosom of\r\nWimp\'s hand-maiden; so obviously that Wimp could not see it. Grodman\r\nenjoyed his Christmas dinner, secure that he had not found a successor\r\nafter all. Wimp, for his part, contemptuously wondered at the way\r\nGrodman\'s thought hovered about Denzil without grazing the truth. A man\r\nconstantly about him, too!\r\n\r\n"Denzil is a man of genius," said Grodman. "And as such comes under the\r\nheading of Suspicious Characters. He has written an Epic Poem and read\r\nit to me. It is morbid from start to finish. There is \'death\' in the\r\nthird line. I daresay you know he polished up my book." Grodman\'s\r\nartlessness was perfect.\r\n\r\n"No. You surprise me," Wimp replied. "I\'m sure he couldn\'t have done\r\nmuch to it. Look at your letter in the \'Pell Mell.\' Who wants more\r\npolish and refinement than that showed?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, I didn\'t know you did me the honor of reading that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; we both read it," put in Mrs. Wimp. "I told Mr. Wimp it was\r\nclever and cogent. After that quotation from the letter to the poor\r\nfellow\'s _fiancee_ there could be no more doubt but that it was murder.\r\nMr. Wimp was convinced by it, too, weren\'t you, Edward?"\r\n\r\nEdward coughed uneasily. It was a true statement, and therefore an\r\nindiscreet. Grodman would plume himself terribly. At this moment Wimp\r\nfelt that Grodman had been right in remaining a bachelor. Grodman\r\nperceived the humor of the situation, and wore a curious, sub-mocking\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"On the day I was born," said Wimp\'s grandmother-in-law, "over a hundred\r\nyears ago, there was a babe murdered." Wimp found himself wishing it had\r\nbeen she. He was anxious to get back to Cantercot. "Don\'t let us talk\r\nshop on Christmas Day," he said, smiling at Grodman. "Besides, murder\r\nisn\'t a very appropriate subject."\r\n\r\n"No, it ain\'t," said Grodman. "How did we get on to it? Oh, yes--Denzil\r\nCantercot. Ha! ha! ha! That\'s curious, for since Denzil wrote \'Criminals\r\nI have Caught,\' his mind\'s running on nothing but murders. A poet\'s\r\nbrain is easily turned."\r\n\r\nWimp\'s eye glittered with excitement and contempt for Grodman\'s\r\nblindness. In Grodman\'s eye there danced an amused scorn of Wimp; to the\r\noutsider his amusement appeared at the expense of the poet.\r\n\r\nHaving wrought his rival up to the highest pitch Grodman slyly and\r\nsuddenly unstrung him.\r\n\r\n"How lucky for Denzil!" he said, still in the same naive, facetious\r\nChristmasy tone, "that he can prove an alibi in this Constant affair."\r\n\r\n"An alibi!" gasped Wimp. "Really?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. He was with his wife, you know. She\'s my woman of all work,\r\nJane. She happened to mention his being with her."\r\n\r\nJane had done nothing of the kind. After the colloquy he had overheard\r\nGrodman had set himself to find out the relation between his two\r\nemployes. By casually referring to Denzil as "your husband" he so\r\nstartled the poor woman that she did not attempt to deny the bond. Only\r\nonce did he use the two words, but he was satisfied. As to the alibi he\r\nhad not yet troubled her; but to take its existence for granted would\r\nupset and discomfort Wimp. For the moment that was triumph enough for\r\nWimp\'s guest.\r\n\r\n"Par," said Wilfred Wimp, "what\'s a alleybi? A marble?"\r\n\r\n"No, my lad," said Grodman, "it means being somewhere else when you\'re\r\nsupposed to be somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Ah, playing truant," said Wilfred self-consciously; his schoolmaster\r\nhad often proved an alibi against him. "Then Denzil will be hanged."\r\n\r\nWas it a prophecy? Wimp accepted it as such; as an oracle from the gods\r\nbidding him mistrust Grodman. Out of the mouths of little children\r\nissueth wisdom; sometimes even when they are not saying their lessons.\r\n\r\n"When I was in my cradle, a century ago," said Wimp\'s\r\ngrandmother-in-law, "men were hanged for stealing horses."\r\n\r\nThey silenced her with snapdragon performances.\r\n\r\nWimp was busy thinking how to get at Grodman\'s factotum.\r\n\r\nGrodman was busy thinking how to get at Wimp\'s domestic.\r\n\r\nNeither received any of the usual messages from the Christmas Bells.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day was sloppy and uncertain. A thin rain drizzled languidly.\r\nOne can stand that sort of thing on a summer Bank Holiday; one expects\r\nit. But to have a bad December Bank Holiday is too much of a bad thing.\r\nSome steps should surely be taken to confuse the weather clerk\'s\r\nchronology. Once let him know that Bank Holiday is coming, and he writes\r\nto the company for more water. To-day his stock seemed low and he was\r\ndribbling it out; at times the wintry sun would shine in a feeble,\r\ndiluted way, and though the holiday-makers would have preferred to take\r\ntheir sunshine neat, they swarmed forth in their myriads whenever there\r\nwas a ray of hope. But it was only dodging the raindrops; up went the\r\numbrellas again, and the streets became meadows of ambulating mushrooms.\r\n\r\nDenzil Cantercot sat in his fur overcoat at the open window, looking at\r\nthe landscape in water colors. He smoked an after-dinner cigarette, and\r\nspoke of the Beautiful. Crowl was with him. They were in the first floor\r\nfront, Crowl\'s bedroom, which, from its view of the Mile End Road, was\r\nlivelier than the parlor with its outlook on the backyard. Mrs. Crowl\r\nwas an anti-tobacconist as regards the best bedroom; but Peter did not\r\nlike to put the poet or his cigarette out. He felt there was something\r\nin common between smoke and poetry, over and above their being both\r\nFads. Besides, Mrs. Crowl was sulking in the kitchen. She had been\r\narranging for an excursion with Peter and the children to Victoria Park.\r\nShe had dreamed of the Crystal Palace, but Santa Claus had put no gifts\r\nin the cobbler\'s shoes. Now she could not risk spoiling the feather in\r\nher bonnet. The nine brats expressed their disappointment by slapping\r\none another on the staircases. Peter felt that Mrs. Crowl connected him\r\nin some way with the rainfall, and was unhappy. Was it not enough that\r\nhe had been deprived of the pleasure of pointing out to a superstitious\r\nmajority the mutual contradictions of Leviticus and the Song of Solomon?\r\nIt was not often that Crowl could count on such an audience.\r\n\r\n"And you still call Nature beautiful?" he said to Denzil, pointing to\r\nthe ragged sky and the dripping eaves. "Ugly old scarecrow!"\r\n\r\n"Ugly she seems to-day," admitted Denzil. "But what is Ugliness but a\r\nhigher form of Beauty? You have to look deeper into it to see it; such\r\nvision is the priceless gift of the few. To me this wan desolation of\r\nsighing rain is lovely as the sea-washed ruins of cities."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but you wouldn\'t like to go out in it," said Peter Crowl. As he\r\nspoke the drizzle suddenly thickened into a torrent.\r\n\r\n"We do not always kiss the woman we love."\r\n\r\n"Speak for yourself, Denzil. I\'m only a plain man, and I want to know if\r\nNature isn\'t a Fad. Hallo, there goes Mortlake! Lord, a minute of this\r\nwill soak him to the skin."\r\n\r\nThe labor leader was walking along with bowed head. He did not seem to\r\nmind the shower. It was some seconds before he even heard Crowl\'s\r\ninvitation to him to take shelter. When he did hear it he shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"I know I can\'t offer you a drawing-room with duchesses stuck about it,"\r\nsaid Peter, vexed.\r\n\r\nTom turned the handle of the shop door and went in. There was nothing in\r\nthe world which now galled him more than the suspicion that he was\r\nstuck-up and wished to cut old friends. He picked his way through the\r\nnine brats who clung affectionately to his wet knees, dispersing them\r\nfinally by a jet of coppers to scramble for. Peter met him on the stair\r\nand shook his hand lovingly and admiringly, and took him into Mrs.\r\nCrowl\'s bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind what I say, Tom. I\'m only a plain man, and my tongue will\r\nsay what comes uppermost! But it ain\'t from the soul, Tom, it ain\'t from\r\nthe soul," said Peter, punning feebly, and letting a mirthless smile\r\nplay over his sallow features. "You know Mr. Cantercot, I suppose? The\r\npoet."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; how do you do, Tom? Seen the \'New Pork Herald\' lately? Not\r\nbad, those old times, eh?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Tom, "I wish I was back in them."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, nonsense," said Peter, in much concern. "Look at the good you\r\nare doing to the working man. Look how you are sweeping away the Fads.\r\nAh, it\'s a grand thing to be gifted, Tom. The idea of your chuckin\'\r\nyourself away on a composin\' room! Manual labor is all very well for\r\nplain men like me, with no gift but just enough brains to see into the\r\nrealities of things--to understand that we\'ve got no soul and no\r\nimmortality, and all that--and too selfish to look after anybody\'s\r\ncomfort but my own and mother\'s and the kid\'s. But men like you and\r\nCantercot--it ain\'t right that you should be peggin\' away at low\r\nmaterial things. Not that I think Cantercot\'s gospel\'s any value to the\r\nmasses. The Beautiful is all very well for folks who\'ve got nothing else\r\nto think of, but give me the True. You\'re the man for my money,\r\nMortlake. No reference to the funds, Tom, to which I contribute little\r\nenough, Heaven knows; though how a place can know anything, Heaven alone\r\nknows. You give us the Useful, Tom; that\'s what the world wants more\r\nthan the Beautiful."\r\n\r\n"Socrates said that the Useful is the Beautiful," said Denzil.\r\n\r\n"That may be," said Peter, "but the Beautiful ain\'t the Useful."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Denzil. "What about Jessie--I mean Miss Dymond? There\'s\r\na combination for you. She always reminds me of Grace Darling. How is\r\nshe, Tom?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s dead!" snapped Tom.\r\n\r\n"What?" Denzil turned as white as a Christmas ghost.\r\n\r\n"It was in the papers," said Tom; "all about her and the lifeboat."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you mean Grace Darling," said Denzil, visibly relieved. "I meant\r\nMiss Dymond."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be so interested in her," said Tom, surlily. "She don\'t\r\nappreciate it. Ah, the shower is over. I must be going."\r\n\r\n"No, stay a little longer, Tom," pleaded Peter. "I see a lot about you\r\nin the papers, but very little of your dear old phiz now. I can\'t spare\r\nthe time to go and hear you. But I really must give myself a treat.\r\nWhen\'s your next show?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am always giving shows," said Tom, smiling a little. "But my next\r\nbig performance is on the twenty-first of January, when that picture of\r\npoor Mr. Constant is to be unveiled at the Bow Break o\' Day Club. They\r\nhave written to Gladstone and other big pots to come down. I do hope the\r\nold man accepts. A non-political gathering like this is the only\r\noccasion we could both speak at, and I have never been on the same\r\nplatform with Gladstone."\r\n\r\nHe forgot his depression and ill-temper in the prospect, and spoke with\r\nmore animation.\r\n\r\n"No, I should hope not, Tom," said Peter. "What with his Fads about the\r\nBible being a Rock, and Monarchy being the right thing, he is a most\r\ndangerous man to lead the Radicals. He never lays his ax to the root of\r\nanything--except oak trees."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cantycot!" It was Mrs. Crowl\'s voice that broke in upon the tirade.\r\n"There\'s a gentleman to see you." The astonishment Mrs. Crowl put into\r\nthe "gentleman" was delightful. It was almost as good as a week\'s rent\r\nto her to give vent to her feelings. The controversial couple had moved\r\naway from the window when Tom entered, and had not noticed the immediate\r\nadvent of another visitor who had spent his time profitably in listening\r\nto Mrs. Crowl before asking to see the presumable object of his visit.\r\n\r\n"Ask him up if it\'s a friend of yours, Cantercot," said Peter. It was\r\nWimp. Denzil was rather dubious as to the friendship, but he preferred\r\nto take Wimp diluted. "Mortlake\'s upstairs," he said. "Will you come up\r\nand see him?"\r\n\r\nWimp had intended a duologue, but he made no objection, so he, too,\r\nstumbled through the nine brats to Mrs. Crowl\'s bedroom. It was a queer\r\nquartette. Wimp had hardly expected to find anybody at the house on\r\nBoxing Day, but he did not care to waste a day. Was not Grodman, too, on\r\nthe track? How lucky it was that Denzil had made the first overtures, so\r\nthat he could approach him without exciting suspicion.\r\n\r\nMortlake scowled when he saw the detective. He objected to the\r\npolice--on principle. But Crowl had no idea who the visitor was, even\r\nwhen told his name. He was rather pleased to meet one of Denzil\'s\r\nhigh-class friends, and welcomed him warmly. Probably he was some famous\r\neditor, which would account for his name stirring vague recollections.\r\nHe summoned the eldest brat and sent him for beer (people would have\r\ntheir Fads), and not without trepidation called down to "Mother" for\r\nglasses. "Mother" observed at night (in the same apartment) that the\r\nbeer money might have paid the week\'s school fees for half the family.\r\n\r\n"We were just talking of poor Mr. Constant\'s portrait, Mr. Wimp," said\r\nthe unconscious Crowl; "they\'re going to unveil it, Mortlake tells me,\r\non the twenty-first of next month at the Bow Break o\' Day Club."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Wimp, elated at being spared the trouble of maneuvering the\r\nconversation; "mysterious affair that, Mr. Crowl."\r\n\r\n"No; it\'s the right thing," said Peter. "There ought to be some memorial\r\nof the man in the district where he worked and where he died, poor\r\nchap." The cobbler brushed away a tear.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s only right," echoed Mortlake a whit eagerly. "He was a noble\r\nfellow, a true philanthropist. The only thoroughly unselfish worker I\'ve\r\never met."\r\n\r\n"He was that," said Peter; "and it\'s a rare pattern is unselfishness.\r\nPoor fellow, poor fellow. He preached the Useful, too. I\'ve never met\r\nhis like. Ah, I wish there was a Heaven for him to go to!" He blew his\r\nnose violently with a red pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s there, if there _is_," said Tom.\r\n\r\n"I hope he is," added Wimp fervently; "but I shouldn\'t like to go there\r\nthe way he did."\r\n\r\n"You were the last person to see him, Tom, weren\'t you?" said Denzil.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," answered Tom quickly. "You remember he went out after me; at\r\nleast, so Mrs. Drabdump said at the inquest."\r\n\r\n"That last conversation he had with you, Tom," said Denzil. "He didn\'t\r\nsay anything to you that would lead you to suppose--"\r\n\r\n"No, of course not!" interrupted Mortlake impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Do you really think he was murdered, Tom?" said Denzil.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Wimp\'s opinion on that point is more valuable than mine," replied\r\nTom, testily. "It may have been suicide. Men often get sick of\r\nlife--especially if they are bored," he added meaningly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but you were the last person known to be with him," said Denzil.\r\n\r\nCrowl laughed. "Had you there, Tom."\r\n\r\nBut they did not have Tom there much longer, for he departed, looking\r\neven worse-tempered than when he came. Wimp went soon after, and Crowl\r\nand Denzil were left to their interminable argumentation concerning the\r\nUseful and the Beautiful.\r\n\r\nWimp went west. He had several strings (or cords) to his bow, and he\r\nultimately found himself at Kensal Green Cemetery. Being there, he went\r\ndown the avenues of the dead to a grave to note down the exact date of a\r\ndeath. It was a day on which the dead seemed enviable. The dull, sodden\r\nsky, the dripping, leafless trees, the wet spongy soil, the reeking\r\ngrass--everything combined to make one long to be in a warm, comfortable\r\ngrave, away from the leaden ennui of life. Suddenly the detective\'s keen\r\neye caught sight of a figure that made his heart throb with sudden\r\nexcitement. It was that of a woman in a gray shawl and a brown bonnet\r\nstanding before a railed-in grave. She had no umbrella. The rain plashed\r\nmournfully upon her, but left no trace on her soaking garments. Wimp\r\ncrept up behind her, but she paid no heed to him. Her eyes were lowered\r\nto the grave, which seemed to be drawing them toward it by some strange\r\nmorbid fascination. His eyes followed hers. The simple headstone bore\r\nthe name: "Arthur Constant."\r\n\r\nWimp tapped her suddenly on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump went deadly white. She turned round, staring at Wimp\r\nwithout any recognition.\r\n\r\n"You remember me, surely," he said. "I\'ve been down once or twice to\r\nyour place about that poor gentleman\'s papers." His eye indicated the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n"Lor! I remember you now," said Mrs. Drabdump.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come under my umbrella? You must be drenched to the skin."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t matter, sir. I can\'t take no hurt. I\'ve had the rheumatics\r\nthis twenty year."\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump shrank from accepting Wimp\'s attentions, not so much\r\nperhaps because he was a man as because he was a gentleman. Mrs.\r\nDrabdump liked to see the fine folks keep their place, and not\r\ncontaminate their skirts by contact with the lower castes. "It\'s set\r\nwet, it\'ll rain right into the new year," she announced. "And they say a\r\nbad beginnin\' makes a worse endin\'." Mrs. Drabdump was one of those\r\npersons who give you the idea that they just missed being born\r\nbarometers.\r\n\r\n"But what are you doing in this miserable spot, so far from home?"\r\nqueried the detective.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Bank Holiday," Mrs. Drabdump reminded him in tones of acute\r\nsurprise. "I always make a hexcursion on Bank Holiday."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Year brought Mrs. Drabdump a new lodger. He was an old gentleman\r\nwith a long gray beard. He rented the rooms of the late Mr. Constant,\r\nand lived a very retired life. Haunted rooms--or rooms that ought to be\r\nhaunted if the ghosts of those murdered in them had any\r\nself-respect--are supposed to fetch a lower rent in the market. The\r\nwhole Irish problem might be solved if the spirits of "Mr. Balfour\'s\r\nvictims" would only depreciate the value of property to a point\r\nconsistent with the support of an agricultural population. But Mrs.\r\nDrabdump\'s new lodger paid so much for his rooms that he laid himself\r\nopen to a suspicion of special interest in ghosts. Perhaps he was a\r\nmember of the Psychical Society. The neighborhood imagined him another\r\nmad philanthropist, but as he did not appear to be doing any good to\r\nanybody it relented and conceded his sanity. Mortlake, who occasionally\r\nstumbled across him in the passage, did not trouble himself to think\r\nabout him at all. He was too full of other troubles and cares. Though he\r\nworked harder than ever, the spirit seemed to have gone out of him.\r\nSometimes he forgot himself in a fine rapture of eloquence--lashing\r\nhimself up into a divine resentment of injustice or a passion of\r\nsympathy with the sufferings of his brethren--but mostly he plodded on\r\nin dull, mechanical fashion. He still made brief provincial tours,\r\nstarring a day here and a day there, and everywhere his admirers\r\nremarked how jaded and overworked he looked. There was talk of starting\r\na subscription to give him a holiday on the Continent--a luxury\r\nobviously unobtainable on the few pounds allowed him per week. The new\r\nlodger would doubtless have been pleased to subscribe, for he seemed\r\nquite to like occupying Mortlake\'s chamber the nights he was absent,\r\nthough he was thoughtful enough not to disturb the hardworked landlady\r\nin the adjoining room by unseemly noise. Wimp was always a quiet man.\r\n\r\nMeantime the 21st of the month approached, and the East End was in\r\nexcitement. Mr. Gladstone had consented to be present at the ceremony of\r\nunveiling the portrait of Arthur Constant, presented by an unknown donor\r\nto the Bow Break o\' Day Club, and it was to be a great function. The\r\nwhole affair was outside the lines of party politics, so that even\r\nConservatives and Socialists considered themselves justified in\r\npestering the committee for tickets. To say nothing of ladies. As the\r\ncommittee desired to be present themselves, nine-tenths of the\r\napplications for admission had to be refused, as is usual on these\r\noccasions. The committee agreed among themselves to exclude the fair sex\r\naltogether as the only way of disposing of their womankind who were\r\nmaking speeches as long as Mr. Gladstone\'s. Each committeeman told his\r\nsisters, female cousins and aunts that the other committeemen had\r\ninsisted on divesting the function of all grace; and what could a man do\r\nwhen he was in a minority of one?\r\n\r\nCrowl, who was not a member of the Break o\' Day Club, was particularly\r\nanxious to hear the great orator whom he despised; fortunately Mortlake\r\nremembered the cobbler\'s anxiety to hear himself, and on the eve of the\r\nceremony sent him a ticket. Crowl was in the first flush of possession\r\nwhen Denzil Cantercot returned, after a sudden and unannounced absence\r\nof three days. His clothes were muddy and tattered, his cocked hat was\r\ndeformed, his cavalier beard was matted, and his eyes were bloodshot.\r\nThe cobbler nearly dropped the ticket at the sight of him. "Hullo,\r\nCantercot!" he gasped. "Why, where have you been all these days?"\r\n\r\n"Terribly busy!" said Denzil. "Here, give me a glass of water. I\'m dry\r\nas the Sahara."\r\n\r\nCrowl ran inside and got the water, trying hard not to inform Mrs. Crowl\r\nof their lodger\'s return. "Mother" had expressed herself freely on the\r\nsubject of the poet during his absence, and not in terms which would\r\nhave commended themselves to the poet\'s fastidious literary sense.\r\nIndeed, she did not hesitate to call him a sponger and a low swindler,\r\nwho had run away to avoid paying the piper. Her fool of a husband might\r\nbe quite sure he would never set eyes on the scoundrel again. However,\r\nMrs. Crowl was wrong. Here was Denzil back again. And yet Mr. Crowl felt\r\nno sense of victory. He had no desire to crow over his partner and to\r\nutter that "See! didn\'t I tell you so?" which is a greater consolation\r\nthan religion in most of the misfortunes of life. Unfortunately, to get\r\nthe water, Crowl had to go to the kitchen; and as he was usually such a\r\ntemperate man, this desire for drink in the middle of the day attracted\r\nthe attention of the lady in possession. Crowl had to explain the\r\nsituation. Mrs. Crowl ran into the shop to improve it. Mr. Crowl\r\nfollowed in dismay, leaving a trail of spilled water in his wake.\r\n\r\n"You good-for-nothing, disreputable scarecrow, where have----"\r\n\r\n"Hush, mother. Let him drink. Mr. Cantercot is thirsty."\r\n\r\n"Does he care if my children are hungry?"\r\n\r\nDenzil tossed the water greedily down his throat almost at a gulp, as if\r\nit were brandy.\r\n\r\n"Madam," he said, smacking his lips, "I do care. I care intensely. Few\r\nthings in life would grieve me more deeply than to hear that a child, a\r\ndear little child--the Beautiful in a nutshell--had suffered hunger. You\r\nwrong me." His voice was tremulous with the sense of injury. Tears stood\r\nin his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Wrong you? I\'ve no wish to wrong you," said Mrs. Crowl. "I should like\r\nto hang you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk of such ugly things," said Denzil, touching his throat\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n"Well, what have you been doin\' all this time?"\r\n\r\n"Why, what should I be doing?"\r\n\r\n"How should I know what became of you? I thought it was another murder."\r\n\r\n"What!" Denzil\'s glass dashed to fragments on the floor. "What do you\r\nmean?"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Crowl was glaring too viciously at Mr. Crowl to reply. He\r\nunderstood the message as if it were printed. It ran: "You have broken\r\none of my best glasses. You have annihilated threepence, or a week\'s\r\nschool fees for half the family." Peter wished she would turn the\r\nlightning upon Denzil, a conductor down whom it would run innocuously.\r\nHe stooped down and picked up the pieces as carefully as if they were\r\ncuttings from the Koh-i-noor. Thus the lightning passed harmlessly over\r\nhis head and flew toward Cantercot.\r\n\r\n"What do I mean?" Mrs. Crowl echoed, as if there had been no interval.\r\n"I mean that it would be a good thing if you had been murdered."\r\n\r\n"What unbeautiful ideas you have, to be sure!" murmured Denzil.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but they\'d be useful," said Mrs. Crowl, who had not lived with\r\nPeter all these years for nothing. "And if you haven\'t been murdered\r\nwhat have you been doing?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, my dear," put in Crowl, deprecatingly, looking up from his\r\nquadrupedal position like a sad dog, "you are not Cantercot\'s keeper."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ain\'t I?" flashed his spouse. "Who else keeps him I should like to\r\nknow?"\r\n\r\nPeter went on picking up the pieces of the Koh-i-noor.\r\n\r\n"I have no secrets from Mrs. Crowl" Denzil explained courteously. "I\r\nhave been working day and night bringing out a new paper. Haven\'t had a\r\nwink of sleep for three nights."\r\n\r\nPeter looked up at his bloodshot eyes with respectful interest.\r\n\r\n"The capitalist met me in the street--an old friend of mine--I was\r\noverjoyed at the _rencontre_ and told him the idea I\'d been brooding\r\nover for months and he promised to stand all the racket."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a paper?" said Peter.\r\n\r\n"Can you ask? To what do you think I\'ve been devoting my days and nights\r\nbut to the cultivation of the Beautiful?"\r\n\r\n"Is that what the paper will be devoted to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. To the Beautiful."\r\n\r\n"I know," snorted Mrs. Crowl, "with portraits of actresses."\r\n\r\n"Portraits? Oh, no!" said Denzil. "That would be the True--not the\r\nBeautiful."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s the name of the paper?" asked Crowl.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s a secret, Peter. Like Scott, I prefer to remain anonymous."\r\n\r\n"Just like your Fads. I\'m only a plain man, and I want to know where the\r\nfun of anonymity comes in? If I had any gifts, I should like to get the\r\ncredit. It\'s a right and natural feeling, to my thinking."\r\n\r\n"Unnatural, Peter; unnatural. We\'re all born anonymous, and I\'m for\r\nsticking close to Nature. Enough for me that I disseminate the\r\nBeautiful. Any letters come during my absence, Mrs. Crowl?"\r\n\r\n"No," she snapped. "But a gent named Grodman called. He said you hadn\'t\r\nbeen to see him for some time, and looked annoyed to hear you\'d\r\ndisappeared. How much have you let him in for?"\r\n\r\n"The man\'s in my debt," said Denzil, annoyed. "I wrote a book for him\r\nand he\'s taken all the credit for it, the rogue! My name doesn\'t appear\r\neven in the Preface. What\'s that ticket you\'re looking so lovingly at,\r\nPeter?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s for to-night--the unveiling of Constant\'s portrait. Gladstone\r\nspeaks. Awful demand for places."\r\n\r\n"Gladstone!" sneered Denzil. "Who wants to hear Gladstone? A man who\'s\r\ndevoted his life to pulling down the pillars of Church and State."\r\n\r\n"A man\'s who\'s devoted his whole life to propping up the crumbling Fads\r\nof Religion and Monarchy. But, for all that, the man has his gifts, and\r\nI\'m burnin\' to hear him."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t go out of my way an inch to hear him," said Denzil; and went\r\nup to his room, and when Mrs. Crowl sent him up a cup of nice strong tea\r\nat tea time, the brat who bore it found him lying dressed on the bed,\r\nsnoring unbeautifully.\r\n\r\nThe evening wore on. It was fine frosty weather. The Whitechapel Road\r\nswarmed, with noisy life, as though it were a Saturday night. The stars\r\nflared in the sky like the lights of celestial costermongers. Everybody\r\nwas on the alert for the advent of Mr. Gladstone. He must surely come\r\nthrough the Road on his journey from the West Bow-wards. But nobody saw\r\nhim or his carriage, except those about the Hall. Probably he went by\r\ntram most of the way. He would have caught cold in an open carriage, or\r\nbobbing his head out of the window of a closed.\r\n\r\n"If he had only been a German prince, or a cannibal king," said Crowl\r\nbitterly, as he plodded toward the Club, "we should have disguised Mile\r\nEnd in bunting and blue fire. But perhaps it\'s a compliment. He knows\r\nhis London, and it\'s no use trying to hide the facts from him. They must\r\nhave queer notions of cities, those monarchs. They must fancy everybody\r\nlives in a flutter of flags and walks about under triumphal arches, like\r\nas if I were to stitch shoes in my Sunday clothes." By a defiance of\r\nchronology Crowl had them on to-day, and they seemed to accentuate the\r\nsimile.\r\n\r\n"And why shouldn\'t life be fuller of the Beautiful," said Denzil. The\r\npoet had brushed the reluctant mud off his garments to the extent it was\r\nwilling to go, and had washed his face, but his eyes were still\r\nbloodshot from the cultivation of the Beautiful. Denzil was accompanying\r\nCrowl to the door of the Club out of good-fellowship. Denzil was himself\r\naccompanied by Grodman, though less obtrusively. Least obtrusively was\r\nhe accompanied by his usual Scotland Yard shadows, Wimp\'s agents. There\r\nwas a surging nondescript crowd about the Club, and the police, and the\r\ndoor-keeper, and the stewards could with difficulty keep out the tide of\r\nthe ticketless, through which the current of the privileged had equal\r\ndifficulty in permeating. The streets all around were thronged with\r\npeople longing for a glimpse of Gladstone. Mortlake drove up in a hansom\r\n(his head a self-conscious pendulum of popularity, swaying and bowing to\r\nright and left) and received all the pent-up enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-by, Cantercot," said Crowl.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ll see you to the door, Peter."\r\n\r\nThey fought their way shoulder to shoulder.\r\n\r\nNow that Grodman had found Denzil he was not going to lose him again. He\r\nhad only found him by accident, for he was himself bound to the\r\nunveiling ceremony, to which he had been invited in view of his known\r\ndevotion to the task of unveiling the Mystery. He spoke to one of the\r\npolicemen about, who said, "Ay, ay, sir," and he was prepared to follow\r\nDenzil, if necessary, and to give up the pleasure of hearing Gladstone\r\nfor an acuter thrill. The arrest must be delayed no longer.\r\n\r\nBut Denzil seemed as if he were going in on the heels of Crowl. This\r\nwould suit Grodman better. He could then have the two pleasures. But\r\nDenzil was stopped half-way through the door.\r\n\r\n"Ticket, sir!"\r\n\r\nDenzil drew himself up to his full height.\r\n\r\n"Press," he said, majestically. All the glories and grandeurs of the\r\nFourth Estate were concentrated in that haughty monosyllable. Heaven\r\nitself is full of journalists who have overawed St. Peter. But the\r\ndoor-keeper was a veritable dragon.\r\n\r\n"What paper, sir?"\r\n\r\n"\'New Pork Herald,\'" said Denzil sharply. He did not relish his word\r\nbeing distrusted.\r\n\r\n"\'New York Herald,\'" said one of the bystanding stewards, scarce\r\ncatching the sounds. "Pass him in."\r\n\r\nAnd in the twinkling of an eye, Denzil had eagerly slipped inside.\r\n\r\nBut during the brief altercation Wimp had come up. Even he could not\r\nmake his face quite impassive, and there was a suppressed intensity in\r\nthe eyes and a quiver about the mouth. He went in on Denzil\'s heels,\r\nblocking up the doorway with Grodman. The two men were so full of their\r\ncoming _coups_ that they struggled for some seconds, side by side,\r\nbefore they recognized each other. Then they shook hands heartily.\r\n\r\n"That was Cantercot just went in, wasn\'t it, Grodman?" said Wimp.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t notice," said Grodman, in tones of utter indifference.\r\n\r\nAt bottom Wimp was terribly excited. He felt that his _coup_ was going\r\nto be executed under very sensational circumstances. Everything would\r\ncombine to turn the eyes of the country upon him--nay, of the world, for\r\nhad not the Big Bow Mystery been discussed in every language under the\r\nsun? In these electric times the criminal achieves a cosmopolitan\r\nreputation. It is a privilege he shares with few other artists. This\r\ntime Wimp would be one of them; and, he felt, deservedly so. If the\r\ncriminal had been cunning to the point of genius in planning the murder,\r\nhe had been acute to the point of divination in detecting it. Never\r\nbefore had he pieced together so broken a chain. He could not resist the\r\nunique opportunity of setting a sensational scheme in a sensational\r\nframe-work. The dramatic instinct was strong in him; he felt like a\r\nplaywright who has constructed a strong melodramatic plot, and has the\r\nDrury Lane stage suddenly offered him to present it on. It would be\r\nfolly to deny himself the luxury, though the presence of Mr. Gladstone\r\nand the nature of the ceremony should perhaps have given him pause. Yet,\r\non the other hand, these were the very factors of the temptation. Wimp\r\nwent in and took a seat behind Denzil. All the seats were numbered, so\r\nthat everybody might have the satisfaction of occupying somebody else\'s.\r\nDenzil was in the special reserved places in the front row just by the\r\ncentral gangway; Crowl was squeezed into a corner behind a pillar near\r\nthe back of the hall. Grodman had been honored with a seat on the\r\nplatform, which was accessible by steps on the right and left, but he\r\nkept his eye on Denzil. The picture of the poor idealist hung on the\r\nwall behind Grodman\'s head, covered by its curtain of brown holland.\r\nThere was a subdued buzz of excitement about the hall, which swelled\r\ninto cheers every now and again as some gentleman known to fame or Bow\r\ntook his place upon the platform. It was occupied by several local M.\r\nP.\'s of varying politics, a number of other Parliamentary satellites of\r\nthe great man, three or four labor leaders, a peer or two of\r\nphilanthropic pretensions, a sprinkling of Toynbee and Oxford Hall men,\r\nthe president and other honorary officials, some of the family and\r\nfriends of the deceased, together with the inevitable percentage of\r\npersons who had no claim to be there save cheek. Gladstone was\r\nlate--later than Mortlake, who was cheered to the echo when he arrived,\r\nsomeone starting "For He\'s a Jolly Good Fellow," as if it were a\r\npolitical meeting. Gladstone came in just in time to acknowledge the\r\ncompliment. The noise of the song, trolled out from iron lungs, had\r\ndrowned the huzzahs heralding the old man\'s advent. The convivial chorus\r\nwent to Mortlake\'s head, as if champagne had really preceded it. His\r\neyes grew moist and dim. He saw himself swimming to the Millenium on\r\nwaves of enthusiasm. Ah, how his brother-toilers should be rewarded for\r\ntheir trust in him!\r\n\r\nWith his usual courtesy and consideration, Mr. Gladstone had refused to\r\nperform the actual unveiling of Arthur Constant\'s portrait. "That," he\r\nsaid in his postcard, "will fall most appropriately to Mr. Mortlake, a\r\ngentleman who has, I am given to understand, enjoyed the personal\r\nfriendship of the late Mr. Constant, and has co-operated with him in\r\nvarious schemes for the organization of skilled and unskilled classes of\r\nlabor, as well as for the diffusion of better ideals--ideals of\r\nself-culture and self-restraint--among the workingmen of Bow, who have\r\nbeen fortunate, so far as I can perceive, in the possession (if in one\r\ncase unhappily only temporary possession) of two such men of undoubted\r\nability and honesty to direct their divided counsels and to lead them\r\nalong a road, which, though I cannot pledge myself to approve of it in\r\nall its turnings and windings, is yet not unfitted to bring them\r\nsomewhat nearer to goals to which there are few of us but would extend\r\nsome measure of hope that the working classes of this great Empire may\r\nin due course, yet with no unnecessary delay, be enabled to arrive."\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone\'s speech was an expansion of his postcard, punctuated by\r\ncheers. The only new thing in it was the graceful and touching way in\r\nwhich he revealed what had been a secret up till then--that the portrait\r\nhad been painted and presented to the Bow Break o\' Day Club, by Lucy\r\nBrent, who in the fulness of time would have been Arthur Constant\'s\r\nwife. It was a painting for which he had sat to her while alive, and she\r\nhad stifled yet pampered her grief by working hard at it since his\r\ndeath. The fact added the last touch of pathos to the occasion. Crowl\'s\r\nface was hidden behind his red handkerchief; even the fire of excitement\r\nin Wimp\'s eye was quenched for a moment by a tear-drop, as he thought of\r\nMrs. Wimp and Wilfred. As for Grodman, there was almost a lump in his\r\nthroat. Denzil Cantercot was the only unmoved man in the room. He\r\nthought the episode quite too Beautiful, and was already weaving it into\r\nrhyme.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of his speech Mr. Gladstone called upon Tom Mortlake\r\nto unveil the portrait. Tom rose, pale and excited. His hand faltered as\r\nhe touched the cord. He seemed overcome with emotion. Was it the mention\r\nof Lucy Brent that had moved him to his depths?\r\n\r\nThe brown holland fell away--the dead stood revealed as he had been in\r\nlife. Every feature, painted by the hand of Love, was instinct with\r\nvitality: the fine, earnest face, the sad kindly eyes, the noble brow\r\nseeming still a-throb with the thought of Humanity. A thrill ran through\r\nthe room--there was a low, undefinable murmur. O, the pathos and the\r\ntragedy of it! Every eye was fixed, misty with emotion, upon the dead\r\nman in the picture and the living man who stood, pale and agitated, and\r\nvisibly unable to commence his speech, at the side of the canvas.\r\nSuddenly a hand was laid upon the labor leader\'s shoulder, and there\r\nrang through the hall in Wimp\'s clear, decisive tones the words: "Tom\r\nMortlake, I arrest you for the murder of Arthur Constant!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was an acute, terrible silence. Mortlake\'s face was\r\nthat of a corpse; the face of the dead man at his side was flushed with\r\nthe hues of life. To the overstrung nerves of the onlookers, the\r\nbrooding eyes of the picture seemed sad and stern with menace, and\r\ncharged with the lightnings of doom.\r\n\r\nIt was a horrible contrast. For Wimp, alone, the painted face had\r\nfuller, more tragical, meanings. The audience seemed turned to stone.\r\nThey sat or stood--in every variety of attitude--frozen, rigid. Arthur\r\nConstant\'s picture dominated the scene, the only living thing in a hall\r\nof the dead.\r\n\r\nBut only for a moment. Mortlake shook off the detective\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Boys!" he cried, in accents of infinite indignation, "this is a police\r\nconspiracy."\r\n\r\nHis words relaxed the tension. The stony figures were agitated. A dull,\r\nexcited hubbub answered him. The little cobbler darted from behind his\r\npillar, and leaped upon a bench. The cords of his brow were swollen with\r\nexcitement. He seemed a giant overshadowing the hall.\r\n\r\n"Boys!" he roared, in his best Victoria Park voice, "listen to me. This\r\ncharge is a foul and damnable lie."\r\n\r\n"Bravo!" "Hear, hear!" "Hooray!" "It is!" was roared back at him from\r\nall parts of the room. Everybody rose and stood in tentative attitudes,\r\nexcited to the last degree.\r\n\r\n"Boys!" Peter roared on, "you all know me. I\'m a plain man, and I want\r\nto know if it\'s likely a man would murder his best friend."\r\n\r\n"No," in a mighty volume of sound.\r\n\r\nWimp had scarcely calculated upon Mortlake\'s popularity. He stood on the\r\nplatform, pale and anxious as his prisoner.\r\n\r\n"And if he did, why didn\'t they prove it the first time?"\r\n\r\n"Hear, hear!"\r\n\r\n"And if they want to arrest him, why couldn\'t they leave it till the\r\nceremony was over? Tom Mortlake\'s not the man to run away."\r\n\r\n"Tom Mortlake! Tom Mortlake! Three cheers for Tom Mortlake! Hip, hip,\r\nhip, hooray!"\r\n\r\n"Three groans for the police." "Hoo! Oo! Oo!"\r\n\r\nWimp\'s melodrama was not going well. He felt like the author to whose\r\nears is borne the ominous sibilance of the pit. He almost wished he had\r\nnot followed the curtain-raiser with his own stronger drama.\r\nUnconsciously the police, scattered about the hall, drew together. The\r\npeople on the platform knew not what to do. They had all risen and stood\r\nin a densely-packed mass. Even Mr. Gladstone\'s speech failed him in\r\ncircumstances so novel. The groans died away; the cheers for Mortlake\r\nrose and swelled and fell and rose again. Sticks and umbrellas were\r\nbanged and rattled, handkerchiefs were waved, the thunder deepened. The\r\nmotley crowd still surging about the hall took up the cheers, and for\r\nhundreds of yards around people were going black in the face out of mere\r\nirresponsible enthusiasm. At last Tom waved his hand--the thunder\r\ndwindled, died. The prisoner was master of the situation.\r\n\r\nGrodman stood on the platform, grasping the back of his chair, a curious\r\nmocking Mephistophelian glitter about his eyes, his lips wreathed into a\r\nhalf smile. There was no hurry for him to get Denzil Cantercot arrested\r\nnow. Wimp had made an egregious, a colossal blunder. In Grodman\'s heart\r\nthere was a great glad calm as of a man who has strained his sinews to\r\nwin in a famous match, and has heard the judge\'s word. He felt almost\r\nkindly to Denzil now.\r\n\r\nTom Mortlake spoke. His face was set and stony. His tall figure was\r\ndrawn up haughtily to its full height. He pushed the black mane back\r\nfrom his forehead with a characteristic gesture. The fevered audience\r\nhung upon his lips--the men at the back leaned eagerly forward--the\r\nreporters were breathless with fear lest they should miss a word. What\r\nwould the great labor leader have to say at this supreme moment?\r\n\r\n"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: It is to me a melancholy pleasure to have\r\nbeen honored with the task of unveiling to-night this portrait of a\r\ngreat benefactor to Bow and a true friend to the laboring classes.\r\nExcept that he honored me with his friendship while living, and that the\r\naspirations of my life have, in my small and restricted way, been\r\nidentical with his, there is little reason why this honorable duty\r\nshould have fallen upon me. Gentlemen, I trust that we shall all find an\r\ninspiring influence in the daily vision of the dead, who yet liveth in\r\nour hearts and in this noble work of art--wrought, as Mr. Gladstone has\r\ntold us, by the hand of one who loved him." The speaker paused a moment,\r\nhis low vibrant tones faltering into silence. "If we humble workingmen\r\nof Bow can never hope to exert individually a tithe of the beneficial\r\ninfluence wielded by Arthur Constant, it is yet possible for each of us\r\nto walk in the light he has kindled in our midst--a perpetual lamp of\r\nself-sacrifice and brotherhood."\r\n\r\nThat was all. The room rang with cheers. Tom Mortlake resumed his seat.\r\nTo Wimp the man\'s audacity verged on the Sublime; to Denzil on the\r\nBeautiful. Again there was a breathless hush. Mr. Gladstone\'s mobile\r\nface was working with excitement. No such extraordinary scene had\r\noccurred in the whole of his extraordinary experience. He seemed about\r\nto rise. The cheering subsided to a painful stillness. Wimp cut the\r\nsituation by laying his hand again upon Tom\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Come quietly with me," he said. The words were almost a whisper, but in\r\nthe supreme silence they traveled to the ends of the hall.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you go, Tom!" The trumpet tones were Peter\'s. The call thrilled\r\nan answering chord of defiance in every breast, and a low, ominous\r\nmurmur swept through the hall.\r\n\r\nTom rose, and there was silence again. "Boys," he said, "let me go.\r\nDon\'t make any noise about it. I shall be with you again to-morrow."\r\n\r\nBut the blood of the Break o\' Day boys was at fever heat. A hurtling\r\nmass of men struggled confusedly from their seats. In a moment all was\r\nchaos. Tom did not move. Half-a-dozen men, headed by Peter, scaled the\r\nplatform. Wimp was thrown to one side, and the invaders formed a ring\r\nround Tom\'s chair. The platform people scampered like mice from the\r\ncenter. Some huddled together in the corners, others slipped out at the\r\nrear. The committee congratulated themselves on having had the\r\nself-denial to exclude ladies. Mr. Gladstone\'s satellites hurried the\r\nold man off and into his carriage; though the fight promised to become\r\nHomeric. Grodman stood at the side of the platform secretly more amused\r\nthan ever, concerning himself no more with Denzil Cantercot, who was\r\nalready strengthening his nerves at the bar upstairs. The police about\r\nthe hall blew their whistles, and policemen came rushing in from outside\r\nand the neighborhood. An Irish M. P. on the platform was waving his\r\ngingham like a shillalah in sheer excitement, forgetting his new-found\r\nrespectability and dreaming himself back at Donnybrook Fair. Him a\r\nconscientious constable floored with a truncheon. But a shower of fists\r\nfell on the zealot\'s face, and he tottered back bleeding. Then the storm\r\nbroke in all its fury. The upper air was black with staves, sticks, and\r\numbrellas, mingled with the pallid hailstones of knobby fists. Yells and\r\ngroans and hoots and battle-cries blent in grotesque chorus, like one of\r\nDvorak\'s weird diabolical movements. Mortlake stood impassive, with arms\r\nfolded, making no further effort, and the battle raged round him as the\r\nwater swirls around some steadfast rock. A posse of police from the back\r\nfought their way steadily toward him, and charged up the heights of the\r\nplatform steps, only to be sent tumbling backward, as their leader was\r\nhurled at them like a battering ram. Upon the top of the heap fell he,\r\nsurmounting the strata of policemen. But others clambered upon them,\r\nescalading the platform. A moment more and Mortlake would have been\r\ntaken, after being well shaken. Then the miracle happened.\r\n\r\nAs when of old a reputable goddess _ex machina_ saw her favorite hero in\r\ndire peril, straightway she drew down a cloud from the celestial stores\r\nof Jupiter and enveloped her fondling in kindly night, so that his\r\nadversary strove with the darkness, so did Crowl, the cunning cobbler,\r\nthe much-daring, essay to insure his friend\'s safety. He turned off the\r\ngas at the meter.\r\n\r\nAn Arctic night--unpreceded by twilight--fell, and there dawned the\r\nsabbath of the witches. The darkness could be felt--and it left blood\r\nand bruises behind it. When the lights were turned on again, Mortlake\r\nwas gone. But several of the rioters were arrested, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nAnd through all, and over all, the face of the dead man who had sought\r\nto bring peace on earth, brooded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCrowl sat meekly eating his supper of bread and cheese, with his head\r\nbandaged, while Denzil Cantercot told him the story of how he had\r\nrescued Tom Mortlake. He had been among the first to scale the height,\r\nand had never budged from Tom\'s side or from the forefront of the battle\r\ntill he had seen him safely outside and into a by-street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crowl sat meekly eating his supper of bread and cheese.]\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you saw that he got away safely," said Crowl, "I wasn\'t\r\nquite sure he would."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I wish some cowardly fool hadn\'t turned off the gas. I like\r\nmen to see that they are beaten."\r\n\r\n"But it seemed--easier," faltered Crowl.\r\n\r\n"Easier!" echoed Denzil, taking a deep draught of bitter. "Really,\r\nPeter, I\'m sorry to find you always will take such low views. It may be\r\neasier, but it\'s shabby. It shocks one\'s sense of the Beautiful."\r\n\r\nCrowl ate his bread and cheese shame-facedly.\r\n\r\n"But what was the use of breaking your head to save him?" said Mrs.\r\nCrowl with an unconscious pun. "He must be caught."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I don\'t see how the Useful does come in, now," said Peter\r\nthoughtfully. "But I didn\'t think of that at the time."\r\n\r\nHe swallowed his water quickly and it went the wrong way and added to\r\nhis confusion. It also began to dawn upon him that he might be called to\r\naccount. Let it be said at once that he wasn\'t. He had taken too\r\nprominent a part.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Mrs. Wimp was bathing Mr. Wimp\'s eye, and rubbing him\r\ngenerally with arnica. Wimp\'s melodrama had been, indeed, a sight for\r\nthe gods. Only, virtue was vanquished and vice triumphant. The villain\r\nhad escaped, and without striking a blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was matter and to spare for the papers the next day. The striking\r\nceremony--Mr. Gladstone\'s speech--the sensational arrest--these would of\r\nthemselves have made excellent themes for reports and leaders. But the\r\npersonality of the man arrested, and the Big Bow Mystery Battle--as it\r\ncame to be called--gave additional piquancy to the paragraphs and the\r\nposters. The behavior of Mortlake put the last touch to the\r\npicturesqueness of the position. He left the hall when the lights went\r\nout, and walked unnoticed and unmolested through pleiads of policemen to\r\nthe nearest police station, where the superintendent was almost too\r\nexcited to take any notice of his demand to be arrested. But to do him\r\njustice, the official yielded as soon as he understood the situation. It\r\nseems inconceivable that he did not violate some red-tape regulation in\r\nso doing. To some this self-surrender was limpid proof of innocence; to\r\nothers it was the damning token of despairing guilt.\r\n\r\nThe morning papers were pleasant reading for Grodman, who chuckled as\r\ncontinuously over his morning egg, as if he had laid it. Jane was\r\nalarmed for the sanity of her saturnine master. As her husband would\r\nhave said, Grodman\'s grins were not Beautiful. But he made no effort to\r\nsuppress them. Not only had Wimp perpetrated a grotesque blunder, but\r\nthe journalists to a man were down on his great sensation tableau,\r\nthough their denunciations did not appear in the dramatic columns. The\r\nLiberal papers said that he had endangered Mr. Gladstone\'s life; the\r\nConservative that he had unloosed the raging elements of Bow\r\nblackguardism, and set in motion forces which might have easily swelled\r\nto a riot, involving severe destruction of property. But "Tom Mortlake,"\r\nwas, after all, the thought swamping every other. It was, in a sense, a\r\ntriumph for the man.\r\n\r\nBut Wimp\'s turn came when Mortlake, who reserved his defense, was\r\nbrought up before a magistrate, and, by force of the new evidence, fully\r\ncommitted for trial on the charge of murdering Arthur Constant. Then\r\nmen\'s thoughts centered again on the Mystery, and the solution of the\r\ninexplicable problem agitated mankind from China to Peru.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of February, the great trial befell. It was another of the\r\nopportunities which the Chancellor of the Exchequer neglects. So\r\nstirring a drama might have easily cleared its expenses--despite the\r\nlength of the cast, the salaries of the stars, and the rent of the\r\nhouse--in mere advance booking. For it was a drama which (by the rights\r\nof Magna Charta) could never be repeated; a drama which ladies of\r\nfashion would have given their earrings to witness, even with the\r\ncentral figure not a woman. And there was a woman in it anyhow, to judge\r\nby the little that had transpired at the magisterial examination, and\r\nthe fact that the country was placarded with bills offering a reward for\r\ninformation concerning a Miss Jessie Dymond. Mortlake was defended by\r\nSir Charles Brown-Harland, Q. C., retained at the expense of the\r\nMortlake Defense Fund (subscriptions to which came also from Australia\r\nand the Continent), and set on his mettle by the fact that he was the\r\naccepted labor candidate for an East-end constituency. Their Majesties,\r\nVictoria and the Law, were represented by Mr. Robert Spigot, Q. C.\r\n\r\nMr. Spigot, Q. C., in presenting his case, said: "I propose to show that\r\nthe prisoner murdered his friend and fellow-lodger, Mr. Arthur Constant,\r\nin cold blood, and with the most careful premeditation; premeditation so\r\nstudied, as to leave the circumstances of the death an impenetrable\r\nmystery for weeks to all the world, though fortunately without\r\naltogether baffling the almost superhuman ingenuity of Mr. Edward Wimp,\r\nof the Scotland Yard Detective Department. I propose to show that the\r\nmotives of the prisoner were jealousy and revenge; jealousy not only of\r\nhis friend\'s superior influence over the workingmen he himself aspired\r\nto lead, but the more commonplace animosity engendered by the disturbing\r\nelement of a woman having relations to both. If, before my case is\r\ncomplete, it will be my painful duty to show that the murdered man was\r\nnot the saint the world has agreed to paint him, I shall not shrink from\r\nunveiling the truer picture, in the interests of justice, which cannot\r\nsay _nil nisi bonum_ even of the dead. I propose to show that the murder\r\nwas committed by the prisoner shortly before half-past six on the\r\nmorning of December 4th, and that the prisoner having, with the\r\nremarkable ingenuity which he has shown throughout, attempted to prepare\r\nan alibi by feigning to leave London by the first train to Liverpool,\r\nreturned home, got in with his latch-key through the street-door, which\r\nhe had left on the latch, unlocked his victim\'s bedroom with a key which\r\nhe possessed, cut the sleeping man\'s throat, pocketed his razor, locked\r\nthe door again, and gave it the appearance of being bolted, went\r\ndownstairs, unslipped the bolt of the big lock, closed the door behind\r\nhim, and got to Euston in time for the second train to Liverpool. The\r\nfog helped his proceedings throughout." Such was in sum the theory of\r\nthe prosecution. The pale defiant figure in the dock winced perceptibly\r\nunder parts of it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump was the first witness called for the prosecution. She was\r\nquite used to legal inquisitiveness by this time, but did not appear in\r\ngood spirits.\r\n\r\n"On the night of December 3d, you gave the prisoner a letter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your ludship."\r\n\r\n"How did he behave when he read it?"\r\n\r\n"He turned very pale and excited. He went up to the poor gentleman\'s\r\nroom, and I\'m afraid he quarreled with him. He might have left his last\r\nhours peaceful." (Amusement.)\r\n\r\n"What happened then?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Mortlake went out in a passion, and came in again in about an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\n"He told you he was going away to Liverpool very early the next\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"No, your ludship, he said he was going to Devonport." (Sensation.)\r\n\r\n"What time did you get up the next morning?"\r\n\r\n"Half-past six."\r\n\r\n"That is not your usual time?"\r\n\r\n"No, I always get up at six."\r\n\r\n"How do you account for the extra sleepiness?"\r\n\r\n"Misfortunes will happen."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t the dull, foggy weather?"\r\n\r\n"No, my lud, else I should never get up early." (Laughter.)\r\n\r\n"You drink something before going to bed?"\r\n\r\n"I like my cup o\' tea. I take it strong, without sugar. It always\r\nsteadies my nerves."\r\n\r\n"Quite so. Where were you when the prisoner told you he was going to\r\nDevonport?"\r\n\r\n"Drinkin\' my tea in the kitchen."\r\n\r\n"What should you say if prisoner dropped something in it to make you\r\nsleep late?"\r\n\r\nWitness (startled): "He ought to be shot."\r\n\r\n"He might have done it without your noticing it, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"If he was clever enough to murder the poor gentleman, he was clever\r\nenough to try and poison me."\r\n\r\nThe Judge: "The witness in her replies must confine herself to the\r\nevidence."\r\n\r\nMr. Spigot, Q. C.: "I must submit to your lordship that it is a very\r\nlogical answer, and exactly illustrates the interdependence of the\r\nprobabilities. Now, Mrs. Drabdump, let us know what happened when you\r\nawoke at half-past six the next morning."\r\n\r\nThereupon Mrs. Drabdump recapitulated the evidence (with new\r\nredundancies, but slight variations) given by her at the inquest. How\r\nshe became alarmed--how she found the street-door locked by the big\r\nlock--how she roused Grodman, and got him to burst open the door--how\r\nthey found the body--all this with which the public was already familiar\r\n_ad nauseam_ was extorted from her afresh.\r\n\r\n"Look at this key" (key passed to the witness). "Do you recognize it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; how did you get it? It\'s the key of my first-floor front. I am\r\nsure I left it sticking in the door."\r\n\r\n"Did you know a Miss Dymond?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Mortlake\'s sweetheart. But I knew he would never marry her,\r\npoor thing." (Sensation.)\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"He was getting too grand for her." (Amusement).\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean anything more than that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; she only came to my place once or twice. The last time I\r\nset eyes on her must have been in October."\r\n\r\n"How did she appear?"\r\n\r\n"She was very miserable, but she wouldn\'t let you see it." (Laughter.)\r\n\r\n"How has the prisoner behaved since the murder?"\r\n\r\n"He always seemed very glum and sorry for it."\r\n\r\nCross-examined: "Did not the prisoner once occupy the bedroom of Mr.\r\nConstant, and give it up to him, so that Mr. Constant might have the two\r\nrooms on the same floor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he didn\'t pay as much."\r\n\r\n"And, while occupying this front bedroom, did not the prisoner once lose\r\nhis key and have another made?"\r\n\r\n"He did; he was very careless."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what the prisoner and Mr. Constant spoke about on the night\r\nof December 3d?"\r\n\r\n"No; I couldn\'t hear."\r\n\r\n"Then how did you know they were quarreling?"\r\n\r\n"They were talkin\' so loud."\r\n\r\nSir Charles Brown-Harland, Q. C. (sharply): "But I\'m talking loudly to\r\nyou now. Should you say I was quarreling?"\r\n\r\n"It takes two to make a quarrel." (Laughter.)\r\n\r\n"Was the prisoner the sort of man who, in your opinion, would commit a\r\nmurder?"\r\n\r\n"No, I never should ha\' guessed it was him."\r\n\r\n"He always struck you as a thorough gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"No, my lud. I knew he was only a comp."\r\n\r\n"You say the prisoner has seemed depressed since the murder. Might not\r\nthat have been due to the disappearance of his sweetheart?"\r\n\r\n"No, he\'d more likely be glad to get rid of her."\r\n\r\n"Then he wouldn\'t be jealous if Mr. Constant took her off his hands?"\r\n(Sensation.)\r\n\r\n"Men are dog-in-the-mangers."\r\n\r\n"Never mind about men, Mrs. Drabdump. Had the prisoner ceased to care\r\nfor Miss Dymond?"\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t seem to think of her, my lud. When he got a letter in her\r\nhandwriting among his heap he used to throw it aside till he\'d torn open\r\nthe others."\r\n\r\nBrown-Harland, Q. C. (with a triumphant ring in his voice): "Thank you,\r\nMrs. Drabdump. You may sit down."\r\n\r\nSpigot, Q. C.: "One moment, Mrs. Drabdump. You say the prisoner had\r\nceased to care for Miss Dymond. Might not this have been in consequence\r\nof his suspecting for some time that she had relations with Mr.\r\nConstant?"\r\n\r\nThe Judge: "That is not a fair question."\r\n\r\nSpigot, Q. C.: "That will do, thank you, Mrs. Drabdump."\r\n\r\nBrown-Harland, Q. C.: "No; one question more, Mrs. Drabdump. Did you\r\never see anything--say when Miss Dymond came to your house--to make you\r\nsuspect anything between Mr. Constant and the prisoner\'s sweetheart?"\r\n\r\n"She did meet him once when Mr. Mortlake was out." (Sensation.)\r\n\r\n"Where did she meet him?"\r\n\r\n"In the passage. He was going out when she knocked and he opened the\r\ndoor." (Amusement.)\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t hear what they said?"\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t a eavesdropper. They spoke friendly and went away together."\r\n\r\nMr. George Grodman was called and repeated his evidence at the inquest.\r\nCross-examined, he testified to the warm friendship between Mr. Constant\r\nand the prisoner. He knew very little about Miss Dymond, having scarcely\r\nseen her. Prisoner had never spoken to him much about her. He should not\r\nthink she was much in prisoner\'s thoughts. Naturally the prisoner had\r\nbeen depressed by the death of his friend. Besides, he was overworked.\r\nWitness thought highly of Mortlake\'s character. It was incredible that\r\nConstant had had improper relations of any kind with his friend\'s\r\npromised wife. Grodman\'s evidence made a very favorable impression on\r\nthe jury; the prisoner looked his gratitude; and the prosecution felt\r\nsorry it had been necessary to call this witness.\r\n\r\nInspector Howlett and Sergeant Runnymede had also to repeat their\r\nevidence. Dr. Robinson, police-surgeon, likewise retendered his evidence\r\nas to the nature of the wound, and the approximate hour of death. But\r\nthis time he was much more severely examined. He would not bind himself\r\ndown to state the time within an hour or two. He thought life had been\r\nextinct two or three hours when he arrived, so that the deed had been\r\ncommitted between seven and eight. Under gentle pressure from the\r\nprosecuting counsel, he admitted that it might possibly have been\r\nbetween six and seven. Cross-examined, he reiterated his impression in\r\nfavor of the later hour.\r\n\r\nSupplementary evidence from medical experts proved as dubious and\r\nuncertain as if the court had confined itself to the original witness.\r\nIt seemed to be generally agreed that the data for determining the time\r\nof death of anybody were too complex and variable to admit of very\r\nprecise inference; _rigor mortis_ and other symptoms setting in within\r\nvery wide limits and differing largely in different persons. All agreed\r\nthat death from such a cut must have been practically instantaneous, and\r\nthe theory of suicide was rejected by all. As a whole the medical\r\nevidence tended to fix the time of death, with a high degree of\r\nprobability, between the hours of six and half-past eight. The efforts\r\nof the Prosecution were bent upon throwing back the time of death to as\r\nearly as possible after about half-past five. The Defense spent all its\r\nstrength upon pinning the experts to the conclusion that death could not\r\nhave been earlier than seven. Evidently the Prosecution was going to\r\nfight hard for the hypothesis that Mortlake had committed the crime in\r\nthe interval between the first and second trains for Liverpool; while\r\nthe Defense was concentrating itself on an alibi, showing that the\r\nprisoner had traveled by the second train which left Euston Station at a\r\nquarter-past seven, so that there could have been no possible time for\r\nthe passage between Bow and Euston. It was an exciting struggle. As yet\r\nthe contending forces seemed equally matched. The evidence had gone as\r\nmuch for as against the prisoner. But everybody knew that worse lay\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n"Call Edward Wimp."\r\n\r\nThe story Edward Wimp had to tell began tamely enough with\r\nthrice-threshed-out facts. But at last the new facts came.\r\n\r\n"In consequence of suspicions that had formed in your mind you took up\r\nyour quarters, disguised, in the late Mr. Constant\'s rooms?"\r\n\r\n"I did; at the commencement of the year. My suspicions had gradually\r\ngathered against the occupants of No. 11, Glover Street, and I resolved\r\nto quash or confirm these suspicions once for all."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell the jury what followed?"\r\n\r\n"Whenever the prisoner was away for the night I searched his room. I\r\nfound the key of Mr. Constant\'s bedroom buried deeply in the side of\r\nprisoner\'s leather sofa. I found what I imagine to be the letter he\r\nreceived on December 3d, in the pages of a \'Bradshaw\' lying under the\r\nsame sofa. There were two razors about."\r\n\r\nMr. Spigot, Q. C., said: "The key has already been identified by Mrs.\r\nDrabdump. The letter I now propose to read."\r\n\r\nIt was undated, and ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     "Dear Tom--This is to bid you farewell. It is the best for us all.\r\n     I am going a long way, dearest. Do not seek to find me, for it will\r\n     be useless. Think of me as one swallowed up by the waters, and be\r\n     assured that it is only to spare you shame and humiliation in the\r\n     future that I tear myself from you and all the sweetness of life.\r\n     Darling, there is no other way. I feel you could never marry me\r\n     now. I have felt it for months. Dear Tom, you will understand what\r\n     I mean. We must look facts in the face. I hope you will always be\r\n     friends with Mr. Constant. Good by, dear. God bless you! May you\r\n     always be happy, and find a worthier wife than I. Perhaps when you\r\n     are great, and rich, and famous, as you deserve, you will sometimes\r\n     think not unkindly of one who, however faulty and unworthy of you,\r\n     will at least love you till the end. Yours, till death,\r\n\r\n     "Jessie."\r\n\r\nBy the time this letter was finished numerous old gentlemen, with wigs\r\nor without, were observed to be polishing their glasses. Mr. Wimp\'s\r\nexamination was resumed.\r\n\r\n"After making these discoveries what did you do?"\r\n\r\n"I made inquiries about Miss Dymond, and found Mr. Constant had visited\r\nher once or twice in the evening. I imagined there would be some traces\r\nof a pecuniary connection. I was allowed by the family to inspect Mr.\r\nConstant\'s check-book, and found a paid check made out for L25 in the\r\nname of Miss Dymond. By inquiry at the Bank, I found it had been cashed\r\non November 12th of last year. I then applied for a warrant against the\r\nprisoner."\r\n\r\nCross-examined: "Do you suggest that the prisoner opened Mr. Constant\'s\r\nbedroom with the key you found?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\nBrown-Harland, Q. C. (sarcastically): "And locked the door from within\r\nwith it on leaving?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Will you have the goodness to explain how the trick was done?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t done. (Laughter.) The prisoner probably locked the door from\r\nthe outside. Those who broke it open naturally imagined it had been\r\nlocked from the inside when they found the key inside. The key would, on\r\nthis theory, be on the floor as the outside locking could not have been\r\neffected if it had been in the lock. The first persons to enter the room\r\nwould naturally believe it had been thrown down in the bursting of the\r\ndoor. Or it might have been left sticking very loosely inside the lock\r\nso as not to interfere with the turning of the outside key in which case\r\nit would also probably have been thrown to the ground."\r\n\r\n"Indeed. Very ingenious. And can you also explain how the prisoner could\r\nhave bolted the door within from the outside?"\r\n\r\n"I can. (Renewed sensation.) There is only one way in which it was\r\npossible--and that was, of course, a mere conjurer\'s illusion. To cause\r\na locked door to appear bolted in addition, it would only be necessary\r\nfor the person on the inside of the door to wrest the staple containing\r\nthe bolt from the woodwork. The bolt in Mr. Constant\'s bedroom worked\r\nperpendicularly. When the staple was torn off, it would simply remain at\r\nrest on the pin of the bolt instead of supporting it or keeping it\r\nfixed. A person bursting open the door and finding the staple resting on\r\nthe pin and torn away from the lintel of the door, would, of course,\r\nimagine he had torn it away, never dreaming the wresting off had been\r\ndone beforehand." (Applause in court, which was instantly checked by the\r\nushers.) The counsel for the defense felt he had been entrapped in\r\nattempting to be sarcastic with the redoubtable detective. Grodman\r\nseemed green with envy. It was the one thing he had not thought of.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drabdump, Grodman, Inspector Howlett, and Sergeant Runnymede were\r\nrecalled and re-examined by the embarrassed Sir Charles Brown-Harland as\r\nto the exact condition of the lock and the bolt and the position of the\r\nkey. It turned out as Wimp had suggested; so prepossessed were the\r\nwitnesses with the conviction that the door was locked and bolted from\r\nthe inside when it was burst open that they were a little hazy about the\r\nexact details. The damage had been repaired, so that it was all a\r\nquestion of precise past observation. The inspector and the sergeant\r\ntestified that the key was in the lock when they saw it, though both the\r\nmortise and the bolt were broken. They were not prepared to say that\r\nWimp\'s theory was impossible; they would even admit it was quite\r\npossible that the staple of the bolt had been torn off beforehand. Mrs.\r\nDrabdump could give no clear account of such petty facts in view of her\r\nimmediate engrossing interest in the horrible sight of the corpse.\r\nGrodman alone was positive that the key was in the door when he burst it\r\nopen. No, he did not remember picking it up from the floor and putting\r\nit in. And he was certain that the staple of the bolt was not broken,\r\nfrom the resistance he experienced in trying to shake the upper panels\r\nof the door.\r\n\r\nBy the Prosecution: "Don\'t you think, from the comparative ease with\r\nwhich the door yielded to your onslaught, that it is highly probable\r\nthat the pin of the bolt was not in a firmly fixed staple, but in one\r\nalready detached from the woodwork of the lintel?"\r\n\r\n"The door did not yield so easily."\r\n\r\n"But you must be a Hercules."\r\n\r\n"Not quite; the bolt was old, and the woodwork crumbling; the lock was\r\nnew and shoddy. But I have always been a strong man."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Mr. Grodman. I hope you will never appear at the\r\nmusic-halls." (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nJessie Dymond\'s landlady was the next witness for the prosecution. She\r\ncorroborated Wimp\'s statements as to Constant\'s occasional visits, and\r\nnarrated how the girl had been enlisted by the dead philanthropist as a\r\ncollaborator in some of his enterprises. But the most telling portion of\r\nher evidence was the story of how, late at night, on December 3d, the\r\nprisoner called upon her and inquired wildly about the whereabouts of\r\nhis sweetheart. He said he had just received a mysterious letter from\r\nMiss Dymond saying she was gone. She (the landlady) replied that she\r\ncould have told him that weeks ago, as her ungrateful lodger was gone\r\nnow some three weeks without leaving a hint behind her. In answer to his\r\nmost ungentlemanly raging and raving, she told him it served him right,\r\nas he should have looked after her better, and not kept away for so\r\nlong. She reminded him that there were as good fish in the sea as ever\r\ncame out, and a girl of Jessie\'s attractions need not pine away (as she\r\nhad seemed to be pining away) for lack of appreciation. He then called\r\nher a liar and left her, and she hoped never to see his face again,\r\nthough she was not surprised to see it in the dock.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzjames Montgomery, a bank clerk, remembered cashing the check\r\nproduced. He particularly remembered it, because he paid the money to a\r\nvery pretty girl. She took the entire amount in gold. At this point the\r\ncase was adjourned.\r\n\r\nDenzil Cantercot was the first witness called for the prosecution on the\r\nresumption of the trial. Pressed as to whether he had not told Mr. Wimp\r\nthat he had overheard the prisoner denouncing Mr. Constant, he could not\r\nsay. He had not actually heard the prisoner\'s denunciations; he might\r\nhave given Mr. Wimp a false impression, but then Mr. Wimp was so\r\nprosaically literal. (Laughter.) Mr. Crowl had told him something of the\r\nkind. Cross-examined, he said Jessie Dymond was a rare spirit and she\r\nalways reminded him of Joan of Arc.\r\n\r\nMr. Crowl, being called, was extremely agitated. He refused to take the\r\noath, and informed the court that the Bible was a Fad. He could not\r\nswear by anything so self-contradictory. He would affirm. He could not\r\ndeny--though he looked like wishing to--that the prisoner had at first\r\nbeen rather mistrustful of Mr. Constant, but he was certain that the\r\nfeeling had quickly worn off. Yes, he was a great friend of the\r\nprisoner, but he didn\'t see why that should invalidate his testimony,\r\nespecially as he had not taken an oath. Certainly the prisoner seemed\r\nrather depressed when he saw him on Bank Holiday, but it was overwork on\r\nbehalf of the people and for the demolition of the Fads.\r\n\r\nSeveral other familiars of the prisoner gave more or less reluctant\r\ntestimony as to his sometime prejudice against the amateur rival labor\r\nleader. His expressions of dislike had been strong and bitter. The\r\nProsecution also produced a poster announcing that the prisoner would\r\npreside at a great meeting of clerks on December 4th. He had not turned\r\nup at this meeting nor sent any explanation. Finally, there was the\r\nevidence of the detectives who originally arrested him at Liverpool\r\nDocks in view of his suspicious demeanor. This completed the case for\r\nthe prosecution.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Brown-Harland, Q. C., rose with a swagger and a rustle of\r\nhis silk gown, and proceeded to set forth the theory of the defense. He\r\nsaid he did not purpose to call any witnesses. The hypothesis of the\r\nprosecution was so inherently childish and inconsequential, and so\r\ndependent upon a bundle of interdependent probabilities that it crumbled\r\naway at the merest touch. The prisoner\'s character was of unblemished\r\nintegrity, his last public appearance had been made on the same platform\r\nwith Mr. Gladstone, and his honesty and highmindedness had been vouched\r\nfor by statesmen of the highest standing. His movements could be\r\naccounted for from hour to hour--and those with which the prosecution\r\ncredited him rested on no tangible evidence whatever. He was also\r\ncredited with superhuman ingenuity and diabolical cunning of which he\r\nhad shown no previous symptom. Hypothesis was piled on hypothesis, as in\r\nthe old Oriental legend, where the world rested on the elephant and the\r\nelephant on the tortoise. It might be worth while, however, to point out\r\nthat it was at least quite likely that the death of Mr. Constant had not\r\ntaken place before seven, and as the prisoner left Euston Station at\r\n7:15 a. m. for Liverpool, he could certainly not have got there from Bow\r\nin the time; also that it was hardly possible for the prisoner, who\r\ncould prove being at Euston Station at 5:25 a. m., to travel backward\r\nand forward to Glover Street and commit the crime all within less than\r\ntwo hours. "The real facts," said Sir Charles impressively, "are most\r\nsimple. The prisoner, partly from pressure of work, partly (he had no\r\nwish to conceal) from worldly ambition, had begun to neglect Miss\r\nDymond, to whom he was engaged to be married. The man was but human, and\r\nhis head was a little turned by his growing importance. Nevertheless, at\r\nheart he was still deeply attached to Miss Dymond. She, however, appears\r\nto have jumped to the conclusion that he had ceased to love her, that\r\nshe was unworthy of him, unfitted by education to take her place side by\r\nside with him in the new spheres to which he was mounting--that, in\r\nshort, she was a drag on his career. Being, by all accounts, a girl of\r\nremarkable force of character, she resolved to cut the Gordian knot by\r\nleaving London, and, fearing lest her affianced husband\'s\r\nconscientiousness should induce him to sacrifice himself to her;\r\ndreading also, perhaps, her own weakness, she made the parting absolute,\r\nand the place of her refuge a mystery. A theory has been suggested which\r\ndrags an honored name in the mire--a theory so superfluous that I shall\r\nonly allude to it. That Arthur Constant could have seduced, or had any\r\nimproper relations with his friend\'s betrothed is a hypothesis to which\r\nthe lives of both give the lie. Before leaving London--or England--Miss\r\nDymond wrote to her aunt in Devonport--her only living relative in this\r\ncountry--asking her as a great favor to forward an addressed letter to\r\nthe prisoner, a fortnight after receipt. The aunt obeyed implicitly.\r\nThis was the letter which fell like a thunderbolt on the prisoner on the\r\nnight of December 3d. All his old love returned--he was full of\r\nself-reproach and pity for the poor girl. The letter read ominously.\r\nPerhaps she was going to put an end to herself. His first thought was to\r\nrush up to his friend, Constant, to seek his advice. Perhaps Constant\r\nknew something of the affair. The prisoner knew the two were in not\r\ninfrequent communication. It is possible--my lord and gentlemen of the\r\njury, I do not wish to follow the methods of the prosecution and confuse\r\ntheory with fact, so I say it is possible--that Mr. Constant had\r\nsupplied her with the L25 to leave the country. He was like a brother to\r\nher, perhaps even acted imprudently in calling upon her, though neither\r\ndreamed of evil. It is possible that he may have encouraged her in her\r\nabnegation and in her altruistic aspirations, perhaps even without\r\nknowing their exact drift, for does he not speak in his very last letter\r\nof the fine female characters he was meeting, and the influence for good\r\nhe had over individual human souls? Still, this we can now never know,\r\nunless the dead speak or the absent return. It is also not impossible\r\nthat Miss Dymond was entrusted with the L25 for charitable purposes. But\r\nto come back to certainties. The prisoner consulted Mr. Constant about\r\nthe letter. He then ran to Miss Dymond\'s lodgings in Stepney Green,\r\nknowing beforehand his trouble would be futile. The letter bore the\r\npostmark of Devonport. He knew the girl had an aunt there; possibly she\r\nmight have gone to her. He could not telegraph, for he was ignorant of\r\nthe address. He consulted his \'Bradshaw,\' and resolved to leave by the\r\n5:30 a. m. from Paddington, and told his landlady so. He left the letter\r\nin the \'Bradshaw,\' which ultimately got thrust among a pile of papers\r\nunder the sofa, so that he had to get another. He was careless and\r\ndisorderly, and the key found by Mr. Wimp in his sofa must have lain\r\nthere for some years, having been lost there in the days when he\r\noccupied the bedroom afterward rented by Mr. Constant. Afraid to miss\r\nhis train, he did not undress on that distressful night. Meantime the\r\nthought occurred to him that Jessie was too clever a girl to leave so\r\neasy a trail, and he jumped to the conclusion that she would be going to\r\nher married brother in America, and had gone to Devonport merely to bid\r\nher aunt farewell. He determined therefore to get to Liverpool, without\r\nwasting time at Devonport, to institute inquiries. Not suspecting the\r\ndelay in the transit of the letter, he thought he might yet stop her,\r\neven at the landing-stage or on the tender. Unfortunately his cab went\r\nslowly in the fog, he missed the first train, and wandered about\r\nbrooding disconsolately in the mist till the second. At Liverpool his\r\nsuspicious, excited demeanor procured his momentary arrest. Since then\r\nthe thought of the lost girl has haunted and broken him. That is the\r\nwhole, the plain, and the sufficing story." The effective witnesses for\r\nthe defense were, indeed, few. It is so hard to prove a negative. There\r\nwas Jessie\'s aunt, who bore out the statement of the counsel for the\r\ndefense. There were the porters who saw him leave Euston by the 7:15\r\ntrain for Liverpool, and arrive just too late for the 5:15; there was\r\nthe cabman (2,138), who drove him to Euston just in time, he (witness)\r\nthought, to catch the 5:15 a. m. Under cross-examination, the cabman got\r\na little confused; he was asked whether, if he really picked up the\r\nprisoner at Bow Railway Station at about 4:30, he ought not to have\r\ncaught the first train at Euston. He said the fog made him drive rather\r\nslowly, but admitted the mist was transparent enough to warrant full\r\nspeed. He also admitted being a strong trade unionist, Spigot, Q. C.,\r\nartfully extorting the admission as if it were of the utmost\r\nsignificance. Finally, there were numerous witnesses--of all sorts and\r\nconditions--to the prisoner\'s high character, as well as to Arthur\r\nConstant\'s blameless and moral life.\r\n\r\nIn his closing speech on the third day of the trial, Sir Charles pointed\r\nout with great exhaustiveness and cogency the flimsiness of the case for\r\nthe prosecution, the number of hypotheses it involved, and their mutual\r\ninterdependence. Mrs. Drabdump was a witness whose evidence must be\r\naccepted with extreme caution. The jury must remember that she was\r\nunable to dissociate her observations from her inferences, and thought\r\nthat the prisoner and Mr. Constant were quarreling merely because they\r\nwere agitated. He dissected her evidence, and showed that it entirely\r\nbore out the story of the defense. He asked the jury to bear in mind\r\nthat no positive evidence (whether of cabmen or others) had been given\r\nof the various and complicated movements attributed to the prisoner on\r\nthe morning of December 4th, between the hours of 5:25 and 7:15 a. m.,\r\nand that the most important witness on the theory of the prosecution--he\r\nmeant, of course, Miss Dymond--had not been produced. Even if she were\r\ndead, and her body were found, no countenance would be given to the\r\ntheory of the prosecution, for the mere conviction that her lover had\r\ndeserted her would be a sufficient explanation of her suicide. Beyond\r\nthe ambiguous letter, no tittle of evidence of her dishonor--on which\r\nthe bulk of the case against the prisoner rested--had been adduced. As\r\nfor the motive of political jealousy that had been a mere passing cloud.\r\nThe two men had become fast friends. As to the circumstances of the\r\nalleged crime, the medical evidence was on the whole in favor of the\r\ntime of death being late; and the prisoner had left London at a quarter\r\npast seven. The drugging theory was absurd, and as for the too clever\r\nbolt and lock theories, Mr. Grodman, a trained scientific observer, had\r\npooh-poohed them. He would solemnly exhort the jury to remember that if\r\nthey condemned the prisoner they would not only send an innocent man to\r\nan ignominious death on the flimsiest circumstantial evidence, but they\r\nwould deprive the workingmen of this country of one of their truest\r\nfriends and their ablest leader.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of Sir Charles\' vigorous speech was greeted with\r\nirrepressible applause.\r\n\r\nMr. Spigot, Q. C., in closing the case for the prosecution, asked the\r\njury to return a verdict against the prisoner for as malicious and\r\npremeditated a crime as ever disgraced the annals of any civilized\r\ncountry. His cleverness and education had only been utilized for the\r\ndevil\'s ends, while his reputation had been used as a cloak. Everything\r\npointed strongly to the prisoner\'s guilt. On receiving Miss Dymond\'s\r\nletter announcing her shame, and (probably) her intention to commit\r\nsuicide, he had hastened upstairs to denounce Constant. He had then\r\nrushed to the girl\'s lodgings, and, finding his worst fears confirmed,\r\nplanned at once his diabolically ingenious scheme of revenge. He told\r\nhis landlady he was going to Devonport, so that if he bungled, the\r\npolice would be put temporarily off his track. His real destination was\r\nLiverpool, for he intended to leave the country. Lest, however, his plan\r\nshould break down here, too, he arranged an ingenious alibi by being\r\ndriven to Euston for the 5:15 train to Liverpool. The cabman would not\r\nknow he did not intend to go by it, but meant to return to 11, Glover\r\nStreet, there to perpetrate this foul crime, interruption to which he\r\nhad possibly barred by drugging his landlady. His presence at Liverpool\r\n(whither he really went by the second train) would corroborate the\r\ncabman\'s story. That night he had not undressed nor gone to bed; he had\r\nplotted out his devilish scheme till it was perfect; the fog came as an\r\nunexpected ally to cover his movements. Jealousy, outraged affection,\r\nthe desire for revenge, the lust for political power--these were human.\r\nThey might pity the criminal, they could not find him innocent of the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Crogie, summing up, began dead against the prisoner.\r\nReviewing the evidence, he pointed out that plausible hypotheses neatly\r\ndove-tailed did not necessarily weaken one another, the fitting so well\r\ntogether of the whole rather making for the truth of the parts. Besides,\r\nthe case for the prosecution was as far from being all hypothesis as the\r\ncase for the defense was from excluding hypothesis. The key, the letter,\r\nthe reluctance to produce the letter, the heated interview with\r\nConstant, the misstatement about the prisoner\'s destination, the flight\r\nto Liverpool, the false tale about searching for a "him," the\r\ndenunciations of Constant, all these were facts. On the other hand,\r\nthere were various lacunae and hypotheses in the case for the defense.\r\nEven conceding the somewhat dubious alibi afforded by the prisoner\'s\r\npresence at Euston at 5:25 a. m., there was no attempt to account for\r\nhis movements between that and 7:15 a. m. It was as possible that he\r\nreturned to Bow as that he lingered about Euston. There was nothing in\r\nthe medical evidence to make his guilt impossible. Nor was there\r\nanything inherently impossible in Constant\'s yielding to the sudden\r\ntemptation of a beautiful girl, nor in a working-girl deeming herself\r\ndeserted, temporarily succumbing to the fascinations of a gentleman and\r\nregretting it bitterly afterward. What had become of the girl was a\r\nmystery. Hers might have been one of those nameless corpses which the\r\ntide swirls up on slimy river banks. The jury must remember, too, that\r\nthe relation might not have actually passed into dishonor, it might have\r\nbeen just grave enough to smite the girl\'s conscience, and to induce her\r\nto behave as she had done. It was enough that her letter should have\r\nexcited the jealousy of the prisoner. There was one other point which he\r\nwould like to impress on the jury, and which the counsel for the\r\nprosecution had not sufficiently insisted upon. This was that the\r\nprisoner\'s guiltiness was the only plausible solution that had ever been\r\nadvanced of the Bow Mystery. The medical evidence agreed that Mr.\r\nConstant did not die by his own hand. Someone must therefore have\r\nmurdered him. The number of people who could have had any possible\r\nreason or opportunity to murder him was extremely small. The prisoner\r\nhad both reason and opportunity. By what logicians called the method of\r\nexclusion, suspicion would attach to him on even slight evidence. The\r\nactual evidence was strong and plausible, and now that Mr. Wimp\'s\r\ningenious theory had enabled them to understand how the door could have\r\nbeen apparently locked and bolted from within, the last difficulty and\r\nthe last argument for suicide had been removed. The prisoner\'s guilt was\r\nas clear as circumstantial evidence could make it. If they let him go\r\nfree, the Bow Mystery might henceforward be placed among the archives of\r\nunavenged assassinations. Having thus well-nigh hung the prisoner, the\r\njudge wound up by insisting on the high probability of the story for the\r\ndefense, though that, too, was dependent in important details upon the\r\nprisoner\'s mere private statements to his counsel. The jury, being by\r\nthis time sufficiently muddled by his impartiality, were dismissed, with\r\nthe exhortation to allow due weight to every fact and probability in\r\ndetermining their righteous verdict.\r\n\r\nThe minutes ran into hours, but the jury did not return. The shadows of\r\nnight fell across the reeking, fevered court before they announced their\r\nverdict--\r\n\r\n"Guilty."\r\n\r\nThe judge put on his black cap.\r\n\r\nThe great reception arranged outside was a fiasco; the evening banquet\r\nwas indefinitely postponed. Wimp had won; Grodman felt like a whipped\r\ncur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n"So you were right," Denzil could not help saying as he greeted Grodman\r\na week afterward. "I shall not live to tell the story of how you\r\ndiscovered the Bow murderer."\r\n\r\n"Sit down," growled Grodman; "perhaps you will after all." There was a\r\ndangerous gleam in his eyes. Denzil was sorry he had spoken.\r\n\r\n"I sent for you," Grodman said, "to tell you that on the night Wimp\r\narrested Mortlake I had made preparations for your arrest."\r\n\r\nDenzil gasped, "What for?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Denzil, there is a little law in this country invented for the\r\nconfusion of the poetic. The greatest exponent of the Beautiful is only\r\nallowed the same number of wives as the greengrocer. I do not blame you\r\nfor not being satisfied with Jane--she is a good servant but a bad\r\nmistress--but it was cruel to Kitty not to inform her that Jane had a\r\nprior right in you, and unjust to Jane not to let her know of the\r\ncontract with Kitty."\r\n\r\n"They both know it now well enough, curse \'em," said the poet.\r\n\r\n"Yes; your secrets are like your situations--you can\'t keep them long.\r\nMy poor poet, I pity you--betwixt the devil and the deep sea."\r\n\r\n"They\'re a pair of harpies, each holding over me the Damocles sword of\r\nan arrest for bigamy. Neither loves me."\r\n\r\n"I should think they would come in very useful to you. You plant one in\r\nmy house to tell my secrets to Wimp, and you plant one in Wimp\'s house\r\nto tell Wimp\'s secrets to me, I suppose. Out with some, then."\r\n\r\n"Upon my honor you wrong me. Jane brought me here, not I Jane. As for\r\nKitty, I never had such a shock in my life as at finding her installed\r\nin Wimp\'s house."\r\n\r\n"She thought it safer to have the law handy for your arrest. Besides,\r\nshe probably desired to occupy a parallel position to Jane\'s. She must\r\ndo something for a living; you wouldn\'t do anything for hers. And so you\r\ncouldn\'t go anywhere without meeting a wife! Ha! ha! ha! Serve you\r\nright, my polygamous poet."\r\n\r\n"But why should you arrest me?"\r\n\r\n"Revenge, Denzil. I have been the best friend you ever had in this cold,\r\nprosaic world. You have eaten my bread, drunk my claret, written my\r\nbook, smoked my cigars, and pocketed my money. And yet, when you have an\r\nimportant piece of information bearing on a mystery about which I am\r\nthinking day and night, you calmly go and sell it to Wimp."\r\n\r\n"I did-didn\'t," stammered Denzil.\r\n\r\n"Liar! Do you think Kitty has any secrets from me? As soon as I\r\ndiscovered your two marriages I determined to have you arrested\r\nfor--your treachery. But when I found you had, as I thought, put Wimp on\r\nthe wrong scent, when I felt sure that by arresting Mortlake he was\r\ngoing to make a greater ass of himself than even nature had been able to\r\ndo, then I forgave you. I let you walk about the earth--and\r\ndrink--freely. Now it is Wimp who crows--everybody pats him on the\r\nback--they call him the mystery man of the Scotland-Yard tribe. Poor Tom\r\nMortlake will be hanged, and all through your telling Wimp about Jessie\r\nDymond!"\r\n\r\n"It was you yourself," said Denzil sullenly. "Everybody was giving it\r\nup. But you said \'Let us find out all that Arthur Constant did in the\r\nlast few months of his life.\' Wimp couldn\'t miss stumbling on Jessie\r\nsooner or later. I\'d have throttled Constant, if I had known he\'d\r\ntouched her," he wound up with irrelevant indignation.\r\n\r\nGrodman winced at the idea that he himself had worked _ad majorem\r\ngloriam_ of Wimp. And yet, had not Mrs. Wimp let out as much at the\r\nChristmas dinner?\r\n\r\n"What\'s past is past," he said gruffly. "But if Tom Mortlake hangs, you\r\ngo to Portland."\r\n\r\n"How can I help Tom hanging?"\r\n\r\n"Help the agitation as much as you can. Write letters under all sorts of\r\nnames to all the papers. Get everybody you know to sign the great\r\npetition. Find out where Jessie Dymond is--the girl who holds the proof\r\nof Tom Mortlake\'s innocence."\r\n\r\n"You really believe him innocent?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be satirical, Denzil. Haven\'t I taken the chair at all the\r\nmeetings? Am I not the most copious correspondent of the Press?"\r\n\r\n"I thought it was only to spite Wimp."\r\n\r\n"Rubbish. It\'s to save poor Tom. He no more murdered Arthur Constant\r\nthan--you did!" He laughed an unpleasant laugh.\r\n\r\nDenzil bade him farewell, frigid with fear.\r\n\r\nGrodman was up to his ears in letters and telegrams. Somehow he had\r\nbecome the leader of the rescue party--suggestions, subscriptions came\r\nfrom all sides. The suggestions were burnt, the subscriptions\r\nacknowledged in the papers and used for hunting up the missing girl.\r\nLucy Brent headed the list with a hundred pounds. It was a fine\r\ntestimony to her faith in her dead lover\'s honor.\r\n\r\nThe release of the Jury had unloosed "The Greater Jury," which always\r\nnow sits upon the smaller. Every means was taken to nullify the value of\r\nthe "palladium of British liberty." The foreman and the jurors were\r\ninterviewed, the judge was judged, and by those who were no judges. The\r\nHome Secretary (who had done nothing beyond accepting office under the\r\nCrown) was vituperated, and sundry provincial persons wrote\r\nconfidentially to the Queen. Arthur Constant\'s backsliding cheered many\r\nby convincing them that others were as bad as themselves; and well-to-do\r\ntradesmen saw in Mortlake\'s wickedness the pernicious effects of\r\nsocialism. A dozen new theories were afloat. Constant had committed\r\nsuicide by Esoteric Buddhism, as witness his devotion to Mme. Blavatsky,\r\nor he had been murdered by his Mahatma, or victimized by Hypnotism,\r\nMesmerism, Somnambulism, and other weird abstractions. Grodman\'s great\r\npoint was--Jessie Dymond must be produced, dead or alive. The electric\r\ncurrent scoured the civilized world in search of her. What wonder if the\r\nshrewder sort divined that the indomitable detective had fixed his last\r\nhope on the girl\'s guilt? If Jessie had wrongs why should she not have\r\navenged them herself? Did she not always remind the poet of Joan of Arc?\r\n\r\nAnother week passed; the shadow of the gallows crept over the days; on,\r\non, remorselessly drawing nearer, as the last ray of hope sank below the\r\nhorizon. The Home Secretary remained inflexible; the great petitions\r\ndischarged their signatures at him in vain. He was a Conservative,\r\nsternly conscientious; and the mere insinuation that his obstinacy was\r\ndue to the politics of the condemned only hardened him against the\r\ntemptation of a cheap reputation for magnanimity. He would not even\r\ngrant a respite, to increase the chances of the discovery of Jessie\r\nDymond. In the last of the three weeks there was a final monster meeting\r\nof protest. Grodman again took the chair, and several distinguished\r\nfaddists were present, as well as numerous respectable members of\r\nsociety. The Home Secretary acknowledged the receipt of their\r\nresolutions. The Trade Unions were divided in their allegiance; some\r\nwhispered of faith and hope, others of financial defalcations. The\r\nformer essayed to organize a procession and an indignation meeting on\r\nthe Sunday preceding the Tuesday fixed for the execution, but it fell\r\nthrough on a rumor of confession. The Monday papers contained a last\r\nmasterly letter from Grodman exposing the weakness of the evidence, but\r\nthey knew nothing of a confession. The prisoner was mute and disdainful,\r\nprofessing little regard for a life empty of love and burdened with\r\nself-reproach. He refused to see clergymen. He was accorded an interview\r\nwith Miss Brent in the presence of a jailer, and solemnly asseverated\r\nhis respect for her dead lover\'s memory. Monday buzzed with rumors; the\r\nevening papers chronicled them hour by hour. A poignant anxiety was\r\nabroad. The girl would be found. Some miracle would happen. A reprieve\r\nwould arrive. The sentence would be commuted. But the short day darkened\r\ninto night even as Mortlake\'s short day was darkening. And the shadow of\r\nthe gallows crept on and on and seemed to mingle with the twilight.\r\n\r\nCrowl stood at the door of his shop, unable to work. His big gray eyes\r\nwere heavy with unshed tears. The dingy wintry road seemed one vast\r\ncemetery; the street lamps twinkled like corpse-lights. The confused\r\nsounds of the street-life reached his ear as from another world. He did\r\nnot see the people who flitted to and fro amid the gathering shadows of\r\nthe cold, dreary night. One ghastly vision flashed and faded and flashed\r\nupon the background of the duskiness.\r\n\r\nDenzil stood beside him, smoking in silence. A cold fear was at his\r\nheart. That terrible Grodman! As the hangman\'s cord was tightening round\r\nMortlake, he felt the convict\'s chains tightening round himself. And yet\r\nthere was one gleam of hope, feeble as the yellow flicker of the\r\ngas-lamp across the way. Grodman had obtained an interview with the\r\ncondemned late that afternoon, and the parting had been painful, but the\r\nevening paper, that in its turn had obtained an interview with the\r\nex-detective, announced on its placard:\r\n\r\n     "GRODMAN STILL CONFIDENT,"\r\n\r\nand the thousands who yet pinned their faith on this extraordinary man\r\nrefused to extinguish the last sparks of hope. Denzil had bought the\r\npaper and scanned it eagerly, but there was nothing save the vague\r\nassurance that the indefatigable Grodman was still almost pathetically\r\nexpectant of the miracle. Denzil did not share the expectation; he\r\nmeditated flight.\r\n\r\n"Peter," he said at last, "I\'m afraid it\'s all over."\r\n\r\nCrowl nodded, heart-broken. "All over!" he repeated, "and to think that\r\nhe dies--and it is--all over!"\r\n\r\nHe looked despairingly at the blank winter sky, where leaden clouds shut\r\nout the stars. "Poor, poor young fellow! To-night alive and thinking.\r\nTo-morrow night a clod, with no more sense or motion than a bit of\r\nleather! No compensation nowhere for being cut off innocent in the pride\r\nof youth and strength! A man who has always preached the Useful day and\r\nnight, and toiled and suffered for his fellows. Where\'s the justice of\r\nit, where\'s the justice of it?" he demanded fiercely. Again his wet eyes\r\nwandered upward toward heaven, that heaven away from which the soul of a\r\ndead saint at the Antipodes was speeding into infinite space.\r\n\r\n"Well, where was the justice for Arthur Constant if he, too, was\r\ninnocent?" said Denzil. "Really, Peter, I don\'t see why you should take\r\nit for granted that Tom is so dreadfully injured. Your horny-handed\r\nlabor leaders are, after all, men of no aesthetic refinement, with no\r\nsense of the Beautiful; you cannot expect them to be exempt from the\r\ncoarser forms of crime. Humanity must look to for other leaders--to the\r\nseers and the poets!"\r\n\r\n"Cantercot, if you say Tom\'s guilty I\'ll knock you down." The little\r\ncobbler turned upon his tall friend like a roused lion. Then he added,\r\n"I beg your pardon, Cantercot, I don\'t mean that. After all, I\'ve no\r\ngrounds. The judge is an honest man, and with gifts I can\'t lay claim\r\nto. But I believe in Tom with all my heart. And if Tom is guilty I\r\nbelieve in the Cause of the People with all my heart all the same. The\r\nFads are doomed to death, they may be reprieved, but they must die at\r\nlast."\r\n\r\nHe drew a deep sigh, and looked along the dreary Road. It was quite dark\r\nnow, but by the light of the lamps and the gas in the shop windows the\r\ndull, monotonous Road lay revealed in all its sordid, familiar outlines;\r\nwith its long stretches of chill pavement, its unlovely architecture,\r\nand its endless stream of prosaic pedestrians.\r\n\r\nA sudden consciousness of the futility of his existence pierced the\r\nlittle cobbler like an icy wind. He saw his own life, and a hundred\r\nmillion lives like his, swelling and breaking like bubbles on a dark\r\nocean, unheeded, uncared for.\r\n\r\nA newsboy passed along, clamoring "The Bow murderer, preparations for\r\nthe hexecution!"\r\n\r\nA terrible shudder shook the cobbler\'s frame. His eyes ranged\r\nsightlessly after the boy; the merciful tears filled them at last.\r\n\r\n"The Cause of the People," he murmured, brokenly, "I believe in the\r\nCause of the People. There is nothing else."\r\n\r\n"Peter, come in to tea, you\'ll catch cold," said Mrs. Crowl.\r\n\r\nDenzil went in to tea and Peter followed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeantime, round the house of the Home Secretary, who was in town, an\r\never-augmenting crowd was gathered, eager to catch the first whisper of\r\na reprieve.\r\n\r\nThe house was guarded by a cordon of police, for there was no\r\ninconsiderable danger of a popular riot. At times a section of the crowd\r\ngroaned and hooted. Once a volley of stones was discharged at the\r\nwindows. The news-boys were busy vending their special editions, and the\r\nreporters struggled through the crowd, clutching descriptive pencils,\r\nand ready to rush off to telegraph offices should anything "extra\r\nspecial" occur. Telegraph boys were coming up every now and again with\r\nthreats, messages, petitions and exhortations from all parts of the\r\ncountry to the unfortunate Home Secretary, who was striving to keep his\r\naching head cool as he went through the voluminous evidence for the last\r\ntime and pondered over the more important letters which "The Greater\r\nJury" had contributed to the obscuration of the problem. Grodman\'s\r\nletter in that morning\'s paper shook him most; under his scientific\r\nanalysis the circumstantial chain seemed forged of painted cardboard.\r\nThen the poor man read the judge\'s summing up, and the chain became\r\ntempered steel. The noise of the crowd outside broke upon his ear in his\r\nstudy like the roar of a distant ocean. The more the rabble hooted him,\r\nthe more he essayed to hold scrupulously the scales of life and death.\r\nAnd the crowd grew and grew, as men came away from their work. There\r\nwere many that loved the man who lay in the jaws of death, and a spirit\r\nof mad revolt surged in their breasts. And the sky was gray, and the\r\nbleak night deepened and the shadow of the gallows crept on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a strange inarticulate murmur spread through the crowd, a vague\r\nwhisper of no one knew what. Something had happened. Somebody was\r\ncoming. A second later and one of the outskirts of the throng was\r\nagitated, and a convulsive cheer went up from it, and was taken up\r\ninfectiously all along the street. The crowd parted--a hansom dashed\r\nthrough the center. "Grodman! Grodman!" shouted those who recognized the\r\noccupant. "Grodman! Hurrah!" Grodman was outwardly calm and pale, but\r\nhis eyes glittered; he waved his hand encouragingly as the hansom dashed\r\nup to the door, cleaving the turbulent crowd as a canoe cleaves the\r\nwaters. Grodman sprang out, the constables at the portal made way for\r\nhim respectfully. He knocked imperatively, the door was opened\r\ncautiously; a boy rushed up and delivered a telegram; Grodman forced his\r\nway in, gave his name, and insisted on seeing the Home Secretary on a\r\nmatter of life and death. Those near the door heard his words and\r\ncheered, and the crowd divined the good omen, and the air throbbed with\r\ncannonades of joyous sound. The cheers rang in Grodman\'s ears as the\r\ndoor slammed behind him. The reporters struggled to the front. An\r\nexcited knot of working men pressed round the arrested hansom, they took\r\nthe horse out. A dozen enthusiasts struggled for the honor of placing\r\nthemselves between the shafts. And the crowd awaited Grodman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrodman was ushered into the conscientious Minister\'s study. The doughty\r\nchief of the agitation was, perhaps, the one man who could not be\r\ndenied. As he entered, the Home Secretary\'s face seemed lit up with\r\nrelief. At a sign from his master, the amanuensis who had brought in the\r\nlast telegram took it back with him into the outer room where he worked.\r\nNeedless to say not a tithe of the Minister\'s correspondence ever came\r\nunder his own eyes.\r\n\r\n"You have a valid reason for troubling me, I suppose, Mr. Grodman?" said\r\nthe Home Secretary, almost cheerfully. "Of course it is about Mortlake?"\r\n\r\n"It is; and I have the best of all reasons."\r\n\r\n"Take a seat. Proceed."\r\n\r\n"Pray do not consider me impertinent, but have you ever given any\r\nattention to the science of evidence?"\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?" asked the Home Secretary, rather puzzled, adding,\r\nwith a melancholy smile, "I have had to lately. Of course, I\'ve never\r\nbeen a criminal lawyer, like some of my predecessors. But I should\r\nhardly speak of it as a science; I look upon it as a question of\r\ncommon-sense."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, sir. It is the most subtle and difficult of all the\r\nsciences. It is, indeed, rather the science of the sciences. What is the\r\nwhole of Inductive Logic, as laid down, say, by Bacon and Mill, but an\r\nattempt to appraise the value of evidence, the said evidence being the\r\ntrails left by the Creator, so to speak? The Creator has--I say it in\r\nall reverence--drawn a myriad red herrings across the track, but the\r\ntrue scientist refuses to be baffled by superficial appearances in\r\ndetecting the secrets of Nature. The vulgar herd catches at the gross\r\napparent fact, but the man of insight knows that what lies on the\r\nsurface does lie."\r\n\r\n"Very interesting, Mr. Grodman, but really----"\r\n\r\n"Bear with me, sir. The science of evidence being thus so extremely\r\nsubtle, and demanding the most acute and trained observation of facts,\r\nthe most comprehensive understanding of human psychology, is naturally\r\ngiven over to professors who have not the remotest idea that \'things are\r\nnot what they seem,\' and that everything is other than it appears; to\r\nprofessors, most of whom, by their year-long devotion to the\r\nshop-counter or the desk, have acquired an intimate acquaintance with\r\nall the infinite shades and complexities of things and human nature.\r\nWhen twelve of these professors are put in a box, it is called a jury.\r\nWhen one of these professors is put in a box by himself, he is called a\r\nwitness. The retailing of evidence--the observation of the facts--is\r\ngiven over to people who go through their lives without eyes; the\r\nappreciation of evidence--the judging of these facts--is surrendered to\r\npeople who may possibly be adepts in weighing out pounds of sugar. Apart\r\nfrom their sheer inability to fulfill either function--to observe, or to\r\njudge--their observation and their judgment alike are vitiated by all\r\nsorts of irrelevant prejudices."\r\n\r\n"You are attacking trial by jury."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily. I am prepared to accept that scientifically, on the\r\nground that, as there are, as a rule, only two alternatives, the balance\r\nof probability is slightly in favor of the true decision being come to.\r\nThen, in cases where experts like myself have got up the evidence, the\r\njury can be made to see through trained eyes."\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary tapped impatiently with his foot.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t listen to abstract theorizing," he said. "Have you any fresh\r\nconcrete evidence?"\r\n\r\n"Sir, everything depends on our getting down to the root of the matter.\r\nWhat percentage of average evidence should you think is thorough, plain,\r\nsimple, unvarnished fact, \'the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth\'?"\r\n\r\n"Fifty?" said the Minister, humoring him a little.\r\n\r\n"Not five. I say nothing of lapses of memory, of inborn defects of\r\nobservational power--though the suspiciously precise recollection of\r\ndates and events possessed by ordinary witnesses in important trials\r\ntaking place years after the occurrences involved, is one of the most\r\namazing things in the curiosities of modern jurisprudence. I defy you,\r\nsir, to tell me what you had for dinner last Monday, or what exactly you\r\nwere saying and doing at five o\'clock last Tuesday afternoon. Nobody\r\nwhose life does not run in mechanical grooves can do anything of the\r\nsort; unless, of course, the facts have been very impressive. But this\r\nby the way. The great obstacle to veracious observation is the element\r\nof prepossession in all vision. Has it ever struck you, sir, that we\r\nnever see anyone more than once, if that? The first time we meet a man\r\nwe may possibly see him as he is; the second time our vision is colored\r\nand modified by the memory of the first. Do our friends appear to us as\r\nthey appear to strangers? Do our rooms, our furniture, our pipes strike\r\nour eye as they would strike the eye of an outsider, looking on them for\r\nthe first time? Can a mother see her babe\'s ugliness, or a lover his\r\nmistress\' shortcomings, though they stare everybody else in the face?\r\nCan we see ourselves as others see us? No; habit, prepossession changes\r\nall. The mind is a large factor of every so-called external fact. The\r\neye sees, sometimes, what it wishes to see, more often what it expects\r\nto see. You follow me, sir?"\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary nodded his head less impatiently. He was beginning to\r\nbe interested. The hubbub from without broke faintly upon their ears.\r\n\r\n"To give you a definite example. Mr. Wimp says that when I burst open\r\nthe door of Mr. Constant\'s room on the morning of December 4th, and saw\r\nthat the staple of the bolt had been wrested by the pin from the lintel,\r\nI jumped at once to the conclusion that I had broken the bolt. Now I\r\nadmit that this was so, only in things like this you do not seem to\r\nconclude, you jump so fast that you see, or seem to. On the other hand,\r\nwhen you see a standing ring of fire produced by whirling a burning\r\nstick, you do not believe in its continuous existence. It is the same\r\nwhen witnessing a legerdemain performance. Seeing is not always\r\nbelieving, despite the proverb; but believing is often seeing. It is not\r\nto the point that in that little matter of the door Wimp was as\r\nhopelessly and incurably wrong as he has been in everything all along.\r\nThough the door was securely bolted, I confess that I should have seen\r\nthat I had broken the bolt in forcing the door, even if it had been\r\nbroken beforehand. Never once since December 4th did this possibility\r\noccur to me, till Wimp with perverted ingenuity suggested it. If this is\r\nthe case with a trained observer, one moreover fully conscious of this\r\nineradicable tendency of the human mind, how must it be with an\r\nuntrained observer?"\r\n\r\n"Come to the point, come to the point," said the Home Secretary, putting\r\nout his hand as if it itched to touch the bell on the writing-table.\r\n\r\n"Such as," went on Grodman imperturbably, "such as--Mrs. Drabdump. That\r\nworthy person is unable, by repeated violent knocking, to arouse her\r\nlodger who yet desires to be aroused; she becomes alarmed, she rushes\r\nacross to get my assistance; I burst open the door--what do you think\r\nthe good lady expected to see?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Constant murdered, I suppose," murmured the Home Secretary,\r\nwonderingly.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. And so she saw it. And what should you think was the condition\r\nof Arthur Constant when the door yielded to my violent exertions and\r\nflew open?"\r\n\r\n"Why, was he not dead?" gasped the Home Secretary, his heart fluttering\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n"Dead? A young, healthy fellow like that! When the door flew open Arthur\r\nConstant was sleeping the sleep of the just. It was a deep, a very deep\r\nsleep, of course, else the blows at his door would long since have\r\nawakened him. But all the while Mrs. Drabdump\'s fancy was picturing her\r\nlodger cold and stark the poor young fellow was lying in bed in a nice\r\nwarm sleep."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say you found Arthur Constant alive?"\r\n\r\n"As you were last night."\r\n\r\nThe minister was silent, striving confusedly to take in the situation.\r\nOutside the crowd was cheering again. It was probably to pass the time.\r\n\r\n"Then, when was he murdered?"\r\n\r\n"Immediately afterward."\r\n\r\n"By whom?"\r\n\r\n"Well, that is, if you will pardon me, not a very intelligent question.\r\nScience and common-sense are in accord for once. Try the method of\r\nexhaustion. It must have been either by Mrs. Drabdump or by myself."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say that Mrs. Drabdump----!"\r\n\r\n"Poor dear Mrs. Drabdump, you don\'t deserve this of your Home Secretary!\r\nThe idea of that good lady!"\r\n\r\n"It was you!"\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself, my dear Home Secretary. There is nothing to be alarmed\r\nat. It was a solitary experiment, and I intend it to remain so." The\r\nnoise without grew louder. "Three cheers for Grodman! Hip, hip, hip,\r\nhooray," fell faintly on their ears.\r\n\r\nBut the Minister, pallid and deeply moved, touched the bell. The Home\r\nSecretary\'s home secretary appeared. He looked at the great man\'s\r\nagitated face with suppressed surprise.\r\n\r\n"Thank you for calling in your amanuensis," said Grodman. "I intended to\r\nask you to lend me his services. I suppose he can write shorthand."\r\n\r\nThe minister nodded, speechless.\r\n\r\n"That is well. I intend this statement to form the basis of an appendix\r\nto the twenty-fifth edition--sort of silver wedding--of my book,\r\n\'Criminals I Have Caught,\' Mr. Denzil Cantercot, who, by the will I have\r\nmade to-day, is appointed my literary executor, will have the task of\r\nworking it up with literary and dramatic touches after the model of the\r\nother chapters of my book. I have every confidence he will be able to do\r\nme as much justice, from a literary point of view, as you, sir, no doubt\r\nwill from a legal. I feel certain he will succeed in catching the style\r\nof the other chapters to perfection."\r\n\r\n"Templeton," whispered the Home Secretary, "this man may be a lunatic.\r\nThe effort to solve the Big Bow Mystery may have addled his brain.\r\nStill," he added aloud, "it will be as well for you to take down his\r\nstatement in shorthand."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir," said Grodman, heartily. "Ready, Mr. Templeton? Here\r\ngoes. My career till I left the Scotland-Yard Detective Department is\r\nknown to all the world. Is that too fast for you, Mr. Templeton? A\r\nlittle? Well, I\'ll go slower; but pull me up if I forget to keep the\r\nbrake on. When I retired, I discovered that I was a bachelor. But it was\r\ntoo late to marry. Time hung on my hands. The preparation of my book,\r\n\'Criminals I Have Caught,\' kept me occupied for some months. When it was\r\npublished I had nothing more to do but think. I had plenty of money, and\r\nit was safely invested; there was no call for speculation. The future\r\nwas meaningless to me; I regretted I had not elected to die in harness.\r\nAs idle old men must, I lived in the past. I went over and over again my\r\nancient exploits; I re-read my book. And as I thought and thought, away\r\nfrom the excitement of the actual hunt, and seeing the facts in a truer\r\nperspective, so it grew daily clearer to me that criminals were more\r\nfools than rogues. Every crime I had traced, however cleverly\r\nperpetrated, was from the point of view of penetrability a weak failure.\r\nTraces and trails were left on all sides--ragged edges, rough-hewn\r\ncorners; in short, the job was botched, artistic completeness\r\nunattained. To the vulgar, my feats might seem marvelous--the average\r\nman is mystified to grasp how you detect the letter \'e\' in a simple\r\ncryptogram--to myself they were as commonplace as the crimes they\r\nunveiled. To me now, with my lifelong study of the science of evidence,\r\nit seemed possible to commit not merely one, but a thousand crimes that\r\nshould be absolutely undiscoverable. And yet criminals would go on\r\nsinning, and giving themselves away, in the same old grooves--no\r\noriginality, no dash, no individual insight, no fresh conception! One\r\nwould imagine there were an Academy of crime with forty thousand\r\narmchairs. And gradually, as I pondered and brooded over the thought,\r\nthere came upon me the desire to commit a crime that should baffle\r\ndetection. I could invent hundreds of such crimes, and please myself by\r\nimagining them done; but would they really work out in practice?\r\nEvidently the sole performer of my experiment must be myself; the\r\nsubject--whom or what? Accident should determine. I itched to commence\r\nwith murder--to tackle the stiffest problems first, and I burned to\r\nstartle and baffle the world--especially the world of which I had ceased\r\nto be. Outwardly I was calm, and spoke to the people about me as usual.\r\nInwardly I was on fire with a consuming scientific passion. I sported\r\nwith my pet theories, and fitted them mentally on everyone I met. Every\r\nfriend or acquaintance I sat and gossiped with, I was plotting how to\r\nmurder without leaving a clue. There is not one of my friends or\r\nacquaintances I have not done away with in thought. There is no public\r\nman--have no fear, my dear Home Secretary--I have not planned to\r\nassassinate secretly, mysteriously, unintelligibly, undiscoverably. Ah,\r\nhow I could give the stock criminals points--with their second-hand\r\nmotives, their conventional conceptions, their commonplace details,\r\ntheir lack of artistic feeling and restraint.\r\n\r\n"The late Arthur Constant came to live nearly opposite me. I cultivated\r\nhis acquaintance--he was a lovable young fellow, an excellent subject\r\nfor experiment. I do not know when I have ever taken to a man more. From\r\nthe moment I first set eyes on him, there was a peculiar sympathy\r\nbetween us. We were drawn to each other. I felt instinctively he would\r\nbe the man. I loved to hear him speak enthusiastically of the\r\nBrotherhood of Man--I, who knew the brotherhood of man was to the ape,\r\nthe serpent, and the tiger--and he seemed to find a pleasure in stealing\r\na moment\'s chat with me from his engrossing self-appointed duties. It is\r\na pity humanity should have been robbed of so valuable a life. But it\r\nhad to be. At a quarter to ten on the night of December 3d he came to\r\nme. Naturally I said nothing about this visit at the inquest or the\r\ntrial. His object was to consult me mysteriously about some girl. He\r\nsaid he had privately lent her money--which she was to repay at her\r\nconvenience. What the money was for he did not know, except that it was\r\nsomehow connected with an act of abnegation in which he had vaguely\r\nencouraged her. The girl had since disappeared, and he was in distress\r\nabout her. He would not tell me who it was--of course now, sir, you know\r\nas well as I it was Jessie Dymond--but asked for advice as to how to set\r\nabout finding her. He mentioned that Mortlake was leaving for Devonport\r\nby the first train on the next day. Of old I should have connected these\r\ntwo facts and sought the thread; now, as he spoke, all my thoughts were\r\ndyed red. He was suffering perceptibly from toothache, and in answer to\r\nmy sympathetic inquiries told me it had been allowing him very little\r\nsleep. Everything combined to invite the trial of one of my favorite\r\ntheories. I spoke to him in a fatherly way, and when I had tendered some\r\nvague advice about the girl, and made him promise to secure a night\'s\r\nrest (before he faced the arduous tram-men\'s meeting in the morning) by\r\ntaking a sleeping-draught, I gave him some sulfonal in a phial. It is a\r\nnew drug, which produces protracted sleep without disturbing the\r\ndigestion, and which I use myself. He promised faithfully to take the\r\ndraught; and I also exhorted him earnestly to bolt and bar and lock\r\nhimself in so as to stop up every chink or aperture by which the cold\r\nair of the winter\'s night might creep into the room. I remonstrated with\r\nhim on the careless manner he treated his body, and he laughed in his\r\ngood-humored, gentle way, and promised to obey me in all things. And he\r\ndid. That Mrs. Drabdump, failing to rouse him, would cry \'Murder!\' I\r\ntook for certain. She is built that way. As even Sir Charles\r\nBrown-Harland remarked, she habitually takes her prepossessions for\r\nfacts, her inferences for observations. She forecasts the future in\r\ngray. Most women of Mrs. Drabdump\'s class would have behaved as she did.\r\nShe happened to be a peculiarly favorable specimen for working on by\r\n\'suggestion,\' but I would have undertaken to produce the same effect on\r\nalmost any woman under similar conditions. The only uncertain link in\r\nthe chain was: Would Mrs. Drabdump rush across to get me to break open\r\nthe door? Women always rush for a man. I was well-nigh the nearest, and\r\ncertainly the most authoritative man in the street, and I took it for\r\ngranted she would."\r\n\r\n"But suppose she hadn\'t?" the Home Secretary could not help asking.\r\n\r\n"Then the murder wouldn\'t have happened, that\'s all. In due course\r\nArthur Constant would have awoke, or somebody else breaking open the\r\ndoor would have found him sleeping; no harm done, nobody any the wiser.\r\nI could hardly sleep myself that night. The thought of the extraordinary\r\ncrime I was about to commit--a burning curiosity to know whether Wimp\r\nwould detect the _modus operandi_--the prospect of sharing the feelings\r\nof murderers with whom I had been in contact all my life without being\r\nin touch with the terrible joys of their inner life--the fear lest I\r\nshould be too fast asleep to hear Mrs. Drabdump\'s knock--these things\r\nagitated me and disturbed my rest. I lay tossing on my bed, planning\r\nevery detail of poor Constant\'s end. The hours dragged slowly and\r\nwretchedly on toward the misty dawn. I was racked with suspense. Was I\r\nto be disappointed after all? At last the welcome sound came--the\r\nrat-tat-tat of murder. The echoes of that knock are yet in my ear. \'Come\r\nover and kill him!\' I put my night-capped head out of the window and\r\ntold her to wait for me. I dressed hurriedly, took my razor, and went\r\nacross to 11 Glover Street. As I broke open the door of the bedroom in\r\nwhich Arthur Constant lay sleeping, his head resting on his hands, I\r\ncried, \'My God!\' as if I saw some awful vision. A mist as of blood\r\nswam before Mrs. Drabdump\'s eyes. She cowered back, for an instant\r\n(I divined rather than saw the action) she shut off the dreaded\r\nsight with her hands. In that instant I had made my cut--precisely,\r\nscientifically--made so deep a cut and drew out the weapon so sharply\r\nthat there was scarce a drop of blood on it; then there came from the\r\nthroat a jet of blood which Mrs. Drabdump, conscious only of the horrid\r\ngash, saw but vaguely. I covered up the face quickly with a handkerchief\r\nto hide any convulsive distortion. But as the medical evidence (in this\r\ndetail accurate) testified, death was instantaneous. I pocketed the\r\nrazor and the empty sulfonal phial. With a woman like Mrs. Drabdump to\r\nwatch me, I could do anything I pleased. I got her to draw my attention\r\nto the fact that both the windows were fastened. Some fool, by the by,\r\nthought there was a discrepancy in the evidence because the police found\r\nonly one window fastened, forgetting that, in my innocence, I took care\r\nnot to fasten the window I had opened to call for aid. Naturally I did\r\nnot call for aid before a considerable time had elapsed. There was Mrs.\r\nDrabdump to quiet, and the excuse of making notes--as an old hand. My\r\nobject was to gain time. I wanted the body to be fairly cold and stiff\r\nbefore being discovered, though there was not much danger here; for, as\r\nyou saw by the medical evidence, there is no telling the time of death\r\nto an hour or two. The frank way in which I said the death was very\r\nrecent disarmed all suspicion, and even Dr. Robinson was unconsciously\r\nworked upon, in adjudging the time of death, by the knowledge (query\r\nhere, Mr. Templeton) that it had preceded my advent on the scene.\r\n\r\n"Before leaving Mrs. Drabdump there is just one point I should like to\r\nsay a word about. You have listened so patiently, sir, to my lectures on\r\nthe science of sciences that you will not refuse to hear the last. A\r\ngood deal of importance has been attached to Mrs. Drabdump\'s\r\noversleeping herself by half an hour. It happens that this (like the\r\ninnocent fog which has also been made responsible for much) is a purely\r\naccidental and irrelevant circumstance. In all works on inductive logic\r\nit is thoroughly recognized that only some of the circumstances of a\r\nphenomenon are of its essence and causally interconnected; there is\r\nalways a certain proportion of heterogeneous accompaniments which have\r\nno intimate relation whatever with the phenomenon. Yet so crude is as\r\nyet the comprehension of the science of evidence, that every feature of\r\nthe phenomenon under investigation is made equally important, and sought\r\nto be linked with the chain of evidence. To attempt to explain\r\neverything is always the mark of the tyro. The fog and Mrs. Drabdump\'s\r\noversleeping herself were mere accidents. There are always these\r\nirrelevant accompaniments, and the true scientist allows for this\r\nelement of (so to speak) chemically unrelated detail. Even I never\r\ncounted on the unfortunate series of accidental phenomena which have led\r\nto Mortlake\'s implication in a network of suspicion. On the other hand,\r\nthe fact that my servant Jane, who usually goes about ten, left a few\r\nminutes earlier on the night of December 3d, so that she didn\'t know of\r\nConstant\'s visit, was a relevant accident. In fact, just as the art of\r\nthe artist or the editor consists largely in knowing what to leave out,\r\nso does the art of the scientific detector of crime consist in knowing\r\nwhat details to ignore. In short, to explain everything is to explain\r\ntoo much. And too much is worse than too little. To return to my\r\nexperiment. My success exceeded my wildest dreams. None had an inkling\r\nof the truth. The insolubility of the Big Bow Mystery teased the acutest\r\nminds in Europe and the civilized world. That a man could have been\r\nmurdered in a thoroughly inaccessible room savored of the ages of magic.\r\nThe redoubtable Wimp, who had been blazoned as my successor, fell back\r\non the theory of suicide. The mystery would have slept till my death,\r\nbut--I fear--for my own ingenuity. I tried to stand outside myself, and\r\nto look at the crime with the eyes of another, or of my old self. I\r\nfound the work of art so perfect as to leave only one sublimely simple\r\nsolution. The very terms of the problem were so inconceivable that, had\r\nI not been the murderer, I should have suspected myself, in conjunction\r\nof course with Mrs. Drabdump. The first persons to enter the room would\r\nhave seemed to me guilty. I wrote at once (in a disguised hand and over\r\nthe signature of \'One Who Looks Through His Own Spectacles\') to the\r\n\'Pell Mell Press\' to suggest this. By associating myself thus with Mrs.\r\nDrabdump I made it difficult for people to dissociate the two who\r\nentered the room together. To dash a half-truth in the world\'s eyes is\r\nthe surest way of blinding it altogether. This letter of mine I\r\ncontradicted myself (in my own name) the next day, and in the course of\r\nthe long letter which I was tempted to write I adduced fresh evidence\r\nagainst the theory of suicide. I was disgusted with the open verdict,\r\nand wanted men to be up and doing and trying to find me out. I enjoyed\r\nthe hunt more. Unfortunately, Wimp, set on the chase again by my own\r\nletter, by dint of persistent blundering, blundered into a track\r\nwhich--by a devilish tissue of coincidences I had neither foreseen nor\r\ndreamt of--seemed to the world the true. Mortlake was arrested and\r\ncondemned. Wimp had apparently crowned his reputation. This was too\r\nmuch. I had taken all this trouble merely to put a feather in Wimp\'s\r\ncap, whereas I had expected to shake his reputation by it. It was bad\r\nenough that an innocent man should suffer; but that Wimp should achieve\r\na reputation he did not deserve, and overshadow all his predecessors by\r\ndint of a colossal mistake, this seemed to me intolerable. I have moved\r\nheaven and earth to get the verdict set aside and to save the prisoner;\r\nI have exposed the weakness of the evidence; I have had the world\r\nsearched for the missing girl; I have petitioned and agitated. In vain.\r\nI have failed. Now I play my last card. As the overweening Wimp could\r\nnot be allowed to go down to posterity as the solver of this terrible\r\nmystery, I decided that the condemned man might just as well profit by\r\nhis exposure. That is the reason I make the exposure to-night, before it\r\nis too late to save Mortlake."\r\n\r\n"So that is the reason?" said the Home Secretary with a suspicion of\r\nmockery in his tones.\r\n\r\n"The sole reason."\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke a deeper roar than ever penetrated the study. The crowd\r\nhad again started cheering. Impatient as the watchers were, they felt\r\nthat no news was good news. The longer the interview accorded by the\r\nHome Secretary to the chairman of the Defense Committee, the greater the\r\nhope his obduracy was melting. The idol of the people would be saved,\r\nand "Grodman" and "Tom Mortlake" were mingled in the exultant plaudits.\r\n\r\n"Templeton," said the Minister, "have you got down every word of Mr.\r\nGrodman\'s confession?"\r\n\r\n"Every word, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then bring in the cable you received just as Mr. Grodman entered the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nTempleton went back into the outer room and brought back the cablegram\r\nthat had been lying on the Minister\'s writing-table when Grodman came\r\nin. The Home Secretary silently handed it to his visitor. It was from\r\nthe Chief of Police of Melbourne, announcing that Jessie Dymond had just\r\narrived in that city in a sailing vessel, ignorant of all that had\r\noccurred, and had been immediately dispatched back to England, having\r\nmade a statement entirely corroborating the theory of the defense.\r\n\r\n"Pending further inquiries into this," said the Home Secretary, not\r\nwithout appreciation of the grim humor of the situation as he glanced at\r\nGrodman\'s ashen cheeks, "I have reprieved the prisoner. Mr. Templeton\r\nwas about to dispatch the messenger to the governor of Newgate as you\r\nentered this room. Mr. Wimp\'s card-castle would have tumbled to pieces\r\nwithout your assistance. Your still undiscoverable crime would have\r\nshaken his reputation as you intended."\r\n\r\nA sudden explosion shook the room and blent with the cheers of the\r\npopulace. Grodman had shot himself--very scientifically--in the heart.\r\nHe fell at the Home Secretary\'s feet, stone dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He fell at the Home Secretary\'s feet, stone dead.]\r\n\r\nSome of the workingmen who had been standing waiting by the shafts of\r\nthe hansom helped to bear the stretcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Antique Library of Standard and Popular 12mos.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ABBE CONSTANTIN.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
