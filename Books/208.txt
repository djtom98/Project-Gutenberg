There are, indeed, many hotels, for the entertainment\r\nof tourists is the business of the place, which, as many travelers will\r\nremember, is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake--a lake that\r\nit behooves every tourist to visit. The shore of the lake presents an\r\nunbroken array of establishments of this order, of every category, from\r\nthe "grand hotel" of the newest fashion, with a chalk-white front, a\r\nhundred balconies, and a dozen flags flying from its roof, to the little\r\nSwiss pension of an elder day, with its name inscribed in German-looking\r\nlettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the\r\nangle of the garden. One of the hotels at Vevey, however, is famous,\r\neven classical, being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors\r\nby an air both of luxury and of maturity. In this region, in the month\r\nof June, American travelers are extremely numerous; it may be said,\r\nindeed, that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics\r\nof an American watering place. There are sights and sounds which evoke a\r\nvision, an echo, of Newport and Saratoga. There is a flitting hither\r\nand thither of "stylish" young girls, a rustling of muslin flounces,\r\na rattle of dance music in the morning hours, a sound of high-pitched\r\nvoices at all times. You receive an impression of these things at the\r\nexcellent inn of the "Trois Couronnes" and are transported in fancy to\r\nthe Ocean House or to Congress Hall. But at the "Trois Couronnes," it\r\nmust be added, there are other features that are much at variance with\r\nthese suggestions: neat German waiters, who look like secretaries of\r\nlegation; Russian princesses sitting in the garden; little Polish boys\r\nwalking about held by the hand, with their governors; a view of the\r\nsunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle\r\nof Chillon.\r\n\r\nI hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were\r\nuppermost in the mind of a young American, who, two or three years ago,\r\nsat in the garden of the "Trois Couronnes," looking about him, rather\r\nidly, at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned. It was a\r\nbeautiful summer morning, and in whatever fashion the young American\r\nlooked at things, they must have seemed to him charming. He had come\r\nfrom Geneva the day before by the little steamer, to see his aunt, who\r\nwas staying at the hotel--Geneva having been for a long time his place\r\nof residence. But his aunt had a headache--his aunt had almost always a\r\nheadache--and now she was shut up in her room, smelling camphor, so that\r\nhe was at liberty to wander about. He was some seven-and-twenty years\r\nof age; when his friends spoke of him, they usually said that he was at\r\nGeneva "studying." When his enemies spoke of him, they said--but,\r\nafter all, he had no enemies; he was an extremely amiable fellow, and\r\nuniversally liked. What I should say is, simply, that when certain\r\npersons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so\r\nmuch time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who\r\nlived there--a foreign lady--a person older than himself. Very few\r\nAmericans--indeed, I think none--had ever seen this lady, about whom\r\nthere were some singular stories. But Winterbourne had an old attachment\r\nfor the little metropolis of Calvinism; he had been put to school there\r\nas a boy, and he had afterward gone to college there--circumstances\r\nwhich had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships. Many of\r\nthese he had kept, and they were a source of great satisfaction to him.\r\n\r\nAfter knocking at his aunt\'s door and learning that she was indisposed,\r\nhe had taken a walk about the town, and then he had come in to his\r\nbreakfast. He had now finished his breakfast; but he was drinking a\r\nsmall cup of coffee, which had been served to him on a little table in\r\nthe garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache. At last\r\nhe finished his coffee and lit a cigarette. Presently a small boy came\r\nwalking along the path--an urchin of nine or ten. The child, who was\r\ndiminutive for his years, had an aged expression of countenance, a pale\r\ncomplexion, and sharp little features. He was dressed in knickerbockers,\r\nwith red stockings, which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks;\r\nhe also wore a brilliant red cravat. He carried in his hand a long\r\nalpenstock, the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that\r\nhe approached--the flowerbeds, the garden benches, the trains of the\r\nladies\' dresses. In front of Winterbourne he paused, looking at him with\r\na pair of bright, penetrating little eyes.\r\n\r\n"Will you give me a lump of sugar?" he asked in a sharp, hard little\r\nvoice--a voice immature and yet, somehow, not young.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne glanced at the small table near him, on which his coffee\r\nservice rested, and saw that several morsels of sugar remained. "Yes,\r\nyou may take one," he answered; "but I don\'t think sugar is good for\r\nlittle boys."\r\n\r\nThis little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of\r\nthe coveted fragments, two of which he buried in the pocket of his\r\nknickerbockers, depositing the other as promptly in another place. He\r\npoked his alpenstock, lance-fashion, into Winterbourne\'s bench and tried\r\nto crack the lump of sugar with his teeth.\r\n\r\n"Oh, blazes; it\'s har-r-d!" he exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a\r\npeculiar manner.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor\r\nof claiming him as a fellow countryman. "Take care you don\'t hurt your\r\nteeth," he said, paternally.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t got any teeth to hurt. They have all come out. I have only\r\ngot seven teeth. My mother counted them last night, and one came out\r\nright afterward. She said she\'d slap me if any more came out. I can\'t\r\nhelp it. It\'s this old Europe. It\'s the climate that makes them come\r\nout. In America they didn\'t come out. It\'s these hotels."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was much amused. "If you eat three lumps of sugar, your\r\nmother will certainly slap you," he said.\r\n\r\n"She\'s got to give me some candy, then," rejoined his young\r\ninterlocutor. "I can\'t get any candy here--any American candy. American\r\ncandy\'s the best candy."\r\n\r\n"And are American little boys the best little boys?" asked Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I\'m an American boy," said the child.\r\n\r\n"I see you are one of the best!" laughed Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Are you an American man?" pursued this vivacious infant. And then,\r\non Winterbourne\'s affirmative reply--"American men are the best," he\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nHis companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had\r\nnow got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he\r\nattacked a second lump of sugar. Winterbourne wondered if he himself\r\nhad been like this in his infancy, for he had been brought to Europe at\r\nabout this age.\r\n\r\n"Here comes my sister!" cried the child in a moment. "She\'s an American\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady\r\nadvancing. "American girls are the best girls," he said cheerfully to\r\nhis young companion.\r\n\r\n"My sister ain\'t the best!" the child declared. "She\'s always blowing at\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I imagine that is your fault, not hers," said Winterbourne. The young\r\nlady meanwhile had drawn near. She was dressed in white muslin, with a\r\nhundred frills and flounces, and knots of pale-colored ribbon. She was\r\nbareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep\r\nborder of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty. "How\r\npretty they are!" thought Winterbourne, straightening himself in his\r\nseat, as if he were prepared to rise.\r\n\r\nThe young lady paused in front of his bench, near the parapet of the\r\ngarden, which overlooked the lake. The little boy had now converted his\r\nalpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he was springing\r\nabout in the gravel and kicking it up not a little.\r\n\r\n"Randolph," said the young lady, "what ARE you doing?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going up the Alps," replied Randolph. "This is the way!" And he\r\ngave another little jump, scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne\'s\r\nears.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way they come down," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"He\'s an American man!" cried Randolph, in his little hard voice.\r\n\r\nThe young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight\r\nat her brother. "Well, I guess you had better be quiet," she simply\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented. He\r\ngot up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his\r\ncigarette. "This little boy and I have made acquaintance," he said, with\r\ngreat civility. In Geneva, as he had been perfectly aware, a young\r\nman was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under\r\ncertain rarely occurring conditions; but here at Vevey, what conditions\r\ncould be better than these?--a pretty American girl coming and standing\r\nin front of you in a garden. This pretty American girl, however, on\r\nhearing Winterbourne\'s observation, simply glanced at him; she then\r\nturned her head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the\r\nopposite mountains. He wondered whether he had gone too far, but he\r\ndecided that he must advance farther, rather than retreat. While he was\r\nthinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little\r\nboy again.\r\n\r\n"I should like to know where you got that pole," she said.\r\n\r\n"I bought it," responded Randolph.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you\'re going to take it to Italy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am going to take it to Italy," the child declared.\r\n\r\nThe young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a\r\nknot or two of ribbon. Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again.\r\n"Well, I guess you had better leave it somewhere," she said after a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to Italy?" Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe young lady glanced at him again. "Yes, sir," she replied. And she\r\nsaid nothing more.\r\n\r\n"Are you--a--going over the Simplon?" Winterbourne pursued, a little\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she said. "I suppose it\'s some mountain. Randolph, what\r\nmountain are we going over?"\r\n\r\n"Going where?" the child demanded.\r\n\r\n"To Italy," Winterbourne explained.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Randolph. "I don\'t want to go to Italy. I want to\r\ngo to America."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Italy is a beautiful place!" rejoined the young man.\r\n\r\n"Can you get candy there?" Randolph loudly inquired.\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said his sister. "I guess you have had enough candy, and\r\nmother thinks so too."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!" cried the\r\nboy, still jumping about.\r\n\r\nThe young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again;\r\nand Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the\r\nview. He was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he had begun to perceive\r\nthat she was not in the least embarrassed herself. There had not been\r\nthe slightest alteration in her charming complexion; she was evidently\r\nneither offended nor flattered. If she looked another way when he spoke\r\nto her, and seemed not particularly to hear him, this was simply her\r\nhabit, her manner. Yet, as he talked a little more and pointed out some\r\nof the objects of interest in the view, with which she appeared quite\r\nunacquainted, she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance;\r\nand then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking.\r\nIt was not, however, what would have been called an immodest glance,\r\nfor the young girl\'s eyes were singularly honest and fresh. They were\r\nwonderfully pretty eyes; and, indeed, Winterbourne had not seen for\r\na long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman\'s various\r\nfeatures--her complexion, her nose, her ears, her teeth. He had a great\r\nrelish for feminine beauty; he was addicted to observing and analyzing\r\nit; and as regards this young lady\'s face he made several observations.\r\nIt was not at all insipid, but it was not exactly expressive; and\r\nthough it was eminently delicate, Winterbourne mentally accused it--very\r\nforgivingly--of a want of finish. He thought it very possible that\r\nMaster Randolph\'s sister was a coquette; he was sure she had a spirit of\r\nher own; but in her bright, sweet, superficial little visage there was\r\nno mockery, no irony. Before long it became obvious that she was much\r\ndisposed toward conversation. She told him that they were going to Rome\r\nfor the winter--she and her mother and Randolph. She asked him if he was\r\na "real American"; she shouldn\'t have taken him for one; he seemed more\r\nlike a German--this was said after a little hesitation--especially when\r\nhe spoke. Winterbourne, laughing, answered that he had met Germans who\r\nspoke like Americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met\r\nan American who spoke like a German. Then he asked her if she should not\r\nbe more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted.\r\nShe answered that she liked standing up and walking about; but she\r\npresently sat down. She told him she was from New York State--"if you\r\nknow where that is." Winterbourne learned more about her by catching\r\nhold of her small, slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes\r\nby his side.\r\n\r\n"Tell me your name, my boy," he said.\r\n\r\n"Randolph C. Miller," said the boy sharply. "And I\'ll tell you her\r\nname;" and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister.\r\n\r\n"You had better wait till you are asked!" said this young lady calmly.\r\n\r\n"I should like very much to know your name," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Her name is Daisy Miller!" cried the child. "But that isn\'t her real\r\nname; that isn\'t her name on her cards."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity you haven\'t got one of my cards!" said Miss Miller.\r\n\r\n"Her real name is Annie P. Miller," the boy went on.\r\n\r\n"Ask him HIS name," said his sister, indicating Winterbourne.\r\n\r\nBut on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to\r\nsupply information with regard to his own family. "My father\'s name is\r\nEzra B. Miller," he announced. "My father ain\'t in Europe; my father\'s\r\nin a better place than Europe."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the\r\nchild had been taught to intimate that Mr. Miller had been removed to\r\nthe sphere of celestial reward. But Randolph immediately added, "My\r\nfather\'s in Schenectady. He\'s got a big business. My father\'s rich, you\r\nbet!"\r\n\r\n"Well!" ejaculated Miss Miller, lowering her parasol and looking at\r\nthe embroidered border. Winterbourne presently released the child,\r\nwho departed, dragging his alpenstock along the path. "He doesn\'t like\r\nEurope," said the young girl. "He wants to go back."\r\n\r\n"To Schenectady, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he wants to go right home. He hasn\'t got any boys here. There is\r\none boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they won\'t let\r\nhim play."\r\n\r\n"And your brother hasn\'t any teacher?" Winterbourne inquired.\r\n\r\n"Mother thought of getting him one, to travel round with us. There was a\r\nlady told her of a very good teacher; an American lady--perhaps you know\r\nher--Mrs. Sanders. I think she came from Boston. She told her of this\r\nteacher, and we thought of getting him to travel round with us. But\r\nRandolph said he didn\'t want a teacher traveling round with us. He said\r\nhe wouldn\'t have lessons when he was in the cars. And we ARE in the cars\r\nabout half the time. There was an English lady we met in the cars--I\r\nthink her name was Miss Featherstone; perhaps you know her. She wanted\r\nto know why I didn\'t give Randolph lessons--give him \'instruction,\' she\r\ncalled it. I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give\r\nhim. He\'s very smart."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Winterbourne; "he seems very smart."\r\n\r\n"Mother\'s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy. Can\r\nyou get good teachers in Italy?"\r\n\r\n"Very good, I should think," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Or else she\'s going to find some school. He ought to learn some more.\r\nHe\'s only nine. He\'s going to college." And in this way Miss Miller\r\ncontinued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other\r\ntopics. She sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with\r\nvery brilliant rings, folded in her lap, and with her pretty eyes now\r\nresting upon those of Winterbourne, now wandering over the garden, the\r\npeople who passed by, and the beautiful view. She talked to Winterbourne\r\nas if she had known him a long time. He found it very pleasant. It was\r\nmany years since he had heard a young girl talk so much. It might have\r\nbeen said of this unknown young lady, who had come and sat down beside\r\nhim upon a bench, that she chattered. She was very quiet; she sat in a\r\ncharming, tranquil attitude; but her lips and her eyes were constantly\r\nmoving. She had a soft, slender, agreeable voice, and her tone was\r\ndecidedly sociable. She gave Winterbourne a history of her movements\r\nand intentions and those of her mother and brother, in Europe, and\r\nenumerated, in particular, the various hotels at which they had stopped.\r\n"That English lady in the cars," she said--"Miss Featherstone--asked me\r\nif we didn\'t all live in hotels in America. I told her I had never been\r\nin so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe. I have never\r\nseen so many--it\'s nothing but hotels." But Miss Miller did not make\r\nthis remark with a querulous accent; she appeared to be in the best\r\nhumor with everything. She declared that the hotels were very good, when\r\nonce you got used to their ways, and that Europe was perfectly sweet.\r\nShe was not disappointed--not a bit. Perhaps it was because she had\r\nheard so much about it before. She had ever so many intimate friends\r\nthat had been there ever so many times. And then she had had ever so\r\nmany dresses and things from Paris. Whenever she put on a Paris dress\r\nshe felt as if she were in Europe.\r\n\r\n"It was a kind of a wishing cap," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Miller without examining this analogy; "it always made\r\nme wish I was here. But I needn\'t have done that for dresses. I am sure\r\nthey send all the pretty ones to America; you see the most frightful\r\nthings here. The only thing I don\'t like," she proceeded, "is the\r\nsociety. There isn\'t any society; or, if there is, I don\'t know where it\r\nkeeps itself. Do you? I suppose there is some society somewhere, but I\r\nhaven\'t seen anything of it. I\'m very fond of society, and I have always\r\nhad a great deal of it. I don\'t mean only in Schenectady, but in New\r\nYork. I used to go to New York every winter. In New York I had lots of\r\nsociety. Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me; and three of them\r\nwere by gentlemen," added Daisy Miller. "I have more friends in New York\r\nthan in Schenectady--more gentleman friends; and more young lady friends\r\ntoo," she resumed in a moment. She paused again for an instant; she was\r\nlooking at Winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and\r\nin her light, slightly monotonous smile. "I have always had," she said,\r\n"a great deal of gentlemen\'s society."\r\n\r\nPoor Winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. He\r\nhad never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion;\r\nnever, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of\r\ndemonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment. And yet was he\r\nto accuse Miss Daisy Miller of actual or potential inconduite, as they\r\nsaid at Geneva? He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he\r\nhad lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the American tone.\r\nNever, indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had\r\nhe encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this.\r\nCertainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! Was she\r\nsimply a pretty girl from New York State? Were they all like that, the\r\npretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen\'s society? Or was she also\r\na designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? Winterbourne\r\nhad lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him.\r\nMiss Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent. Some people had told him\r\nthat, after all, American girls were exceedingly innocent; and others\r\nhad told him that, after all, they were not. He was inclined to think\r\nMiss Daisy Miller was a flirt--a pretty American flirt. He had never, as\r\nyet, had any relations with young ladies of this category. He had\r\nknown, here in Europe, two or three women--persons older than Miss Daisy\r\nMiller, and provided, for respectability\'s sake, with husbands--who were\r\ngreat coquettes--dangerous, terrible women, with whom one\'s relations\r\nwere liable to take a serious turn. But this young girl was not a\r\ncoquette in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a\r\npretty American flirt. Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found\r\nthe formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller. He leaned back in his\r\nseat; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had\r\never seen; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations\r\nof one\'s intercourse with a pretty American flirt. It presently became\r\napparent that he was on the way to learn.\r\n\r\n"Have you been to that old castle?" asked the young girl, pointing with\r\nher parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon.\r\n\r\n"Yes, formerly, more than once," said Winterbourne. "You too, I suppose,\r\nhave seen it?"\r\n\r\n"No; we haven\'t been there. I want to go there dreadfully. Of course I\r\nmean to go there. I wouldn\'t go away from here without having seen that\r\nold castle."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very pretty excursion," said Winterbourne, "and very easy to\r\nmake. You can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer."\r\n\r\n"You can go in the cars," said Miss Miller.\r\n\r\n"Yes; you can go in the cars," Winterbourne assented.\r\n\r\n"Our courier says they take you right up to the castle," the young girl\r\ncontinued. "We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers\r\ndreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn\'t go. Randolph wouldn\'t\r\ngo either; he says he doesn\'t think much of old castles. But I guess\r\nwe\'ll go this week, if we can get Randolph."\r\n\r\n"Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments?" Winterbourne\r\ninquired, smiling.\r\n\r\n"He says he don\'t care much about old castles. He\'s only nine. He\r\nwants to stay at the hotel. Mother\'s afraid to leave him alone, and the\r\ncourier won\'t stay with him; so we haven\'t been to many places. But it\r\nwill be too bad if we don\'t go up there." And Miss Miller pointed again\r\nat the Chateau de Chillon.\r\n\r\n"I should think it might be arranged," said Winterbourne. "Couldn\'t you\r\nget some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph?"\r\n\r\nMiss Miller looked at him a moment, and then, very placidly, "I wish YOU\r\nwould stay with him!" she said.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne hesitated a moment. "I should much rather go to Chillon\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"With me?" asked the young girl with the same placidity.\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t rise, blushing, as a young girl at Geneva would have done;\r\nand yet Winterbourne, conscious that he had been very bold, thought\r\nit possible she was offended. "With your mother," he answered very\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss\r\nDaisy Miller. "I guess my mother won\'t go, after all," she said. "She\r\ndon\'t like to ride round in the afternoon. But did you really mean what\r\nyou said just now--that you would like to go up there?"\r\n\r\n"Most earnestly," Winterbourne declared.\r\n\r\n"Then we may arrange it. If mother will stay with Randolph, I guess\r\nEugenio will."\r\n\r\n"Eugenio?" the young man inquired.\r\n\r\n"Eugenio\'s our courier. He doesn\'t like to stay with Randolph; he\'s the\r\nmost fastidious man I ever saw. But he\'s a splendid courier. I guess\r\nhe\'ll stay at home with Randolph if mother does, and then we can go to\r\nthe castle."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible--"we" could\r\nonly mean Miss Daisy Miller and himself. This program seemed almost too\r\nagreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young lady\'s\r\nhand. Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but\r\nat this moment another person, presumably Eugenio, appeared. A tall,\r\nhandsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and\r\na brilliant watch chain, approached Miss Miller, looking sharply at her\r\ncompanion. "Oh, Eugenio!" said Miss Miller with the friendliest accent.\r\n\r\nEugenio had looked at Winterbourne from head to foot; he now bowed\r\ngravely to the young lady. "I have the honor to inform mademoiselle that\r\nluncheon is upon the table."\r\n\r\nMiss Miller slowly rose. "See here, Eugenio!" she said; "I\'m going to\r\nthat old castle, anyway."\r\n\r\n"To the Chateau de Chillon, mademoiselle?" the courier inquired.\r\n"Mademoiselle has made arrangements?" he added in a tone which struck\r\nWinterbourne as very impertinent.\r\n\r\nEugenio\'s tone apparently threw, even to Miss Miller\'s own apprehension,\r\na slightly ironical light upon the young girl\'s situation. She turned\r\nto Winterbourne, blushing a little--a very little. "You won\'t back out?"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"I shall not be happy till we go!" he protested.\r\n\r\n"And you are staying in this hotel?" she went on. "And you are really an\r\nAmerican?"\r\n\r\nThe courier stood looking at Winterbourne offensively. The young man,\r\nat least, thought his manner of looking an offense to Miss Miller; it\r\nconveyed an imputation that she "picked up" acquaintances. "I shall have\r\nthe honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me,"\r\nhe said, smiling and referring to his aunt.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, we\'ll go some day," said Miss Miller. And she gave him a\r\nsmile and turned away. She put up her parasol and walked back to the inn\r\nbeside Eugenio. Winterbourne stood looking after her; and as she moved\r\naway, drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that\r\nshe had the tournure of a princess.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising\r\nto present his aunt, Mrs. Costello, to Miss Daisy Miller. As soon as the\r\nformer lady had got better of her headache, he waited upon her in her\r\napartment; and, after the proper inquiries in regard to her health, he\r\nasked her if she had observed in the hotel an American family--a mamma,\r\na daughter, and a little boy.\r\n\r\n"And a courier?" said Mrs. Costello. "Oh yes, I have observed them. Seen\r\nthem--heard them--and kept out of their way." Mrs. Costello was a widow\r\nwith a fortune; a person of much distinction, who frequently intimated\r\nthat, if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches, she would\r\nprobably have left a deeper impress upon her time. She had a long, pale\r\nface, a high nose, and a great deal of very striking white hair, which\r\nshe wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head. She had\r\ntwo sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe. This\r\nyoung man was amusing himself at Hamburg, and, though he was on his\r\ntravels, was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment\r\nselected by his mother for her own appearance there. Her nephew, who had\r\ncome up to Vevey expressly to see her, was therefore more attentive than\r\nthose who, as she said, were nearer to her. He had imbibed at Geneva the\r\nidea that one must always be attentive to one\'s aunt. Mrs. Costello\r\nhad not seen him for many years, and she was greatly pleased with him,\r\nmanifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets\r\nof that social sway which, as she gave him to understand, she exerted in\r\nthe American capital. She admitted that she was very exclusive; but, if\r\nhe were acquainted with New York, he would see that one had to be. And\r\nher picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of\r\nthat city, which she presented to him in many different lights, was, to\r\nWinterbourne\'s imagination, almost oppressively striking.\r\n\r\nHe immediately perceived, from her tone, that Miss Daisy Miller\'s place\r\nin the social scale was low. "I am afraid you don\'t approve of them," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"They are very common," Mrs. Costello declared. "They are the sort of\r\nAmericans that one does one\'s duty by not--not accepting."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you don\'t accept them?" said the young man.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t, my dear Frederick. I would if I could, but I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"The young girl is very pretty," said Winterbourne in a moment.\r\n\r\n"Of course she\'s pretty. But she is very common."\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean, of course," said Winterbourne after another pause.\r\n\r\n"She has that charming look that they all have," his aunt resumed. "I\r\ncan\'t think where they pick it up; and she dresses in perfection--no,\r\nyou don\'t know how well she dresses. I can\'t think where they get their\r\ntaste."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear aunt, she is not, after all, a Comanche savage."\r\n\r\n"She is a young lady," said Mrs. Costello, "who has an intimacy with her\r\nmamma\'s courier."\r\n\r\n"An intimacy with the courier?" the young man demanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the mother is just as bad! They treat the courier like a familiar\r\nfriend--like a gentleman. I shouldn\'t wonder if he dines with them.\r\nVery likely they have never seen a man with such good manners, such\r\nfine clothes, so like a gentleman. He probably corresponds to the young\r\nlady\'s idea of a count. He sits with them in the garden in the evening.\r\nI think he smokes."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures; they helped\r\nhim to make up his mind about Miss Daisy. Evidently she was rather wild.\r\n"Well," he said, "I am not a courier, and yet she was very charming to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You had better have said at first," said Mrs. Costello with dignity,\r\n"that you had made her acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"We simply met in the garden, and we talked a bit."\r\n\r\n"Tout bonnement! And pray what did you say?"\r\n\r\n"I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable\r\naunt."\r\n\r\n"I am much obliged to you."\r\n\r\n"It was to guarantee my respectability," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"And pray who is to guarantee hers?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you are cruel!" said the young man. "She\'s a very nice young girl."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say that as if you believed it," Mrs. Costello observed.\r\n\r\n"She is completely uncultivated," Winterbourne went on. "But she is\r\nwonderfully pretty, and, in short, she is very nice. To prove that I\r\nbelieve it, I am going to take her to the Chateau de Chillon."\r\n\r\n"You two are going off there together? I should say it proved just the\r\ncontrary. How long had you known her, may I ask, when this interesting\r\nproject was formed? You haven\'t been twenty-four hours in the house."\r\n\r\n"I have known her half an hour!" said Winterbourne, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" cried Mrs. Costello. "What a dreadful girl!"\r\n\r\nHer nephew was silent for some moments. "You really think, then," he\r\nbegan earnestly, and with a desire for trustworthy information--"you\r\nreally think that--" But he paused again.\r\n\r\n"Think what, sir?" said his aunt.\r\n\r\n"That she is the sort of young lady who expects a man, sooner or later,\r\nto carry her off?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do. But\r\nI really think that you had better not meddle with little American girls\r\nthat are uncultivated, as you call them. You have lived too long out of\r\nthe country. You will be sure to make some great mistake. You are too\r\ninnocent."\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt, I am not so innocent," said Winterbourne, smiling and\r\ncurling his mustache.\r\n\r\n"You are guilty too, then!"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively. "You won\'t let\r\nthe poor girl know you then?" he asked at last.\r\n\r\n"Is it literally true that she is going to the Chateau de Chillon with\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I think that she fully intends it."\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear Frederick," said Mrs. Costello, "I must decline the honor\r\nof her acquaintance. I am an old woman, but I am not too old, thank\r\nHeaven, to be shocked!"\r\n\r\n"But don\'t they all do these things--the young girls in America?"\r\nWinterbourne inquired.\r\n\r\nMrs. Costello stared a moment. "I should like to see my granddaughters\r\ndo them!" she declared grimly.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for Winterbourne\r\nremembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in New York were\r\n"tremendous flirts." If, therefore, Miss Daisy Miller exceeded the\r\nliberal margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that\r\nanything might be expected of her. Winterbourne was impatient to see her\r\nagain, and he was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he should not\r\nappreciate her justly.\r\n\r\nThough he was impatient to see her, he hardly knew what he should say\r\nto her about his aunt\'s refusal to become acquainted with her; but he\r\ndiscovered, promptly enough, that with Miss Daisy Miller there was\r\nno great need of walking on tiptoe. He found her that evening in the\r\ngarden, wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph,\r\nand swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld. It was ten\r\no\'clock. He had dined with his aunt, had been sitting with her since\r\ndinner, and had just taken leave of her till the morrow. Miss Daisy\r\nMiller seemed very glad to see him; she declared it was the longest\r\nevening she had ever passed.\r\n\r\n"Have you been all alone?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I have been walking round with mother. But mother gets tired walking\r\nround," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Has she gone to bed?"\r\n\r\n"No; she doesn\'t like to go to bed," said the young girl. "She doesn\'t\r\nsleep--not three hours. She says she doesn\'t know how she lives. She\'s\r\ndreadfully nervous. I guess she sleeps more than she thinks. She\'s gone\r\nsomewhere after Randolph; she wants to try to get him to go to bed. He\r\ndoesn\'t like to go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope she will persuade him," observed Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"She will talk to him all she can; but he doesn\'t like her to talk\r\nto him," said Miss Daisy, opening her fan. "She\'s going to try to get\r\nEugenio to talk to him. But he isn\'t afraid of Eugenio. Eugenio\'s a\r\nsplendid courier, but he can\'t make much impression on Randolph! I don\'t\r\nbelieve he\'ll go to bed before eleven." It appeared that Randolph\'s\r\nvigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged, for Winterbourne strolled\r\nabout with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother. "I\r\nhave been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to," his\r\ncompanion resumed. "She\'s your aunt." Then, on Winterbourne\'s admitting\r\nthe fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it, she\r\nsaid she had heard all about Mrs. Costello from the chambermaid. She was\r\nvery quiet and very comme il faut; she wore white puffs; she spoke to no\r\none, and she never dined at the table d\'hote. Every two days she had a\r\nheadache. "I think that\'s a lovely description, headache and all!" said\r\nMiss Daisy, chattering along in her thin, gay voice. "I want to know her\r\never so much. I know just what YOUR aunt would be; I know I should like\r\nher. She would be very exclusive. I like a lady to be exclusive; I\'m\r\ndying to be exclusive myself. Well, we ARE exclusive, mother and I. We\r\ndon\'t speak to everyone--or they don\'t speak to us. I suppose it\'s about\r\nthe same thing. Anyway, I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was embarrassed. "She would be most happy," he said; "but I\r\nam afraid those headaches will interfere."\r\n\r\nThe young girl looked at him through the dusk. "But I suppose she\r\ndoesn\'t have a headache every day," she said sympathetically.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was silent a moment. "She tells me she does," he answered\r\nat last, not knowing what to say.\r\n\r\nMiss Daisy Miller stopped and stood looking at him. Her prettiness was\r\nstill visible in the darkness; she was opening and closing her enormous\r\nfan. "She doesn\'t want to know me!" she said suddenly. "Why don\'t you\r\nsay so? You needn\'t be afraid. I\'m not afraid!" And she gave a little\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched,\r\nshocked, mortified by it. "My dear young lady," he protested, "she knows\r\nno one. It\'s her wretched health."\r\n\r\nThe young girl walked on a few steps, laughing still. "You needn\'t be\r\nafraid," she repeated. "Why should she want to know me?" Then she paused\r\nagain; she was close to the parapet of the garden, and in front of her\r\nwas the starlit lake. There was a vague sheen upon its surface, and in\r\nthe distance were dimly seen mountain forms. Daisy Miller looked out\r\nupon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh.\r\n"Gracious! she IS exclusive!" she said. Winterbourne wondered whether\r\nshe was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense\r\nof injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to\r\nreassure and comfort her. He had a pleasant sense that she would be very\r\napproachable for consolatory purposes. He felt then, for the instant,\r\nquite ready to sacrifice his aunt, conversationally; to admit that she\r\nwas a proud, rude woman, and to declare that they needn\'t mind her.\r\nBut before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture\r\nof gallantry and impiety, the young lady, resuming her walk, gave an\r\nexclamation in quite another tone. "Well, here\'s Mother! I guess she\r\nhasn\'t got Randolph to go to bed." The figure of a lady appeared at a\r\ndistance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and\r\nwavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to pause.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure it is your mother? Can you distinguish her in this thick\r\ndusk?" Winterbourne asked.\r\n\r\n"Well!" cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh; "I guess I know my own\r\nmother. And when she has got on my shawl, too! She is always wearing my\r\nthings."\r\n\r\nThe lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot\r\nat which she had checked her steps.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid your mother doesn\'t see you," said Winterbourne.\r\n"Or perhaps," he added, thinking, with Miss Miller, the joke\r\npermissible--"perhaps she feels guilty about your shawl."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s a fearful old thing!" the young girl replied serenely. "I told\r\nher she could wear it. She won\'t come here because she sees you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then," said Winterbourne, "I had better leave you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; come on!" urged Miss Daisy Miller.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid your mother doesn\'t approve of my walking with you."\r\n\r\nMiss Miller gave him a serious glance. "It isn\'t for me; it\'s for\r\nyou--that is, it\'s for HER. Well, I don\'t know who it\'s for! But mother\r\ndoesn\'t like any of my gentlemen friends. She\'s right down timid. She\r\nalways makes a fuss if I introduce a gentleman. But I DO introduce\r\nthem--almost always. If I didn\'t introduce my gentlemen friends to\r\nMother," the young girl added in her little soft, flat monotone, "I\r\nshouldn\'t think I was natural."\r\n\r\n"To introduce me," said Winterbourne, "you must know my name." And he\r\nproceeded to pronounce it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, I can\'t say all that!" said his companion with a laugh. But\r\nby this time they had come up to Mrs. Miller, who, as they drew near,\r\nwalked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently\r\nat the lake and turning her back to them. "Mother!" said the young\r\ngirl in a tone of decision. Upon this the elder lady turned round. "Mr.\r\nWinterbourne," said Miss Daisy Miller, introducing the young man very\r\nfrankly and prettily. "Common," she was, as Mrs. Costello had pronounced\r\nher; yet it was a wonder to Winterbourne that, with her commonness, she\r\nhad a singularly delicate grace.\r\n\r\nHer mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye,\r\na very exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain\r\namount of thin, much frizzled hair. Like her daughter, Mrs. Miller was\r\ndressed with extreme elegance; she had enormous diamonds in her ears.\r\nSo far as Winterbourne could observe, she gave him no greeting--she\r\ncertainly was not looking at him. Daisy was near her, pulling her shawl\r\nstraight. "What are you doing, poking round here?" this young lady\r\ninquired, but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice\r\nof words may imply.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said her mother, turning toward the lake again.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t think you\'d want that shawl!" Daisy exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Well I do!" her mother answered with a little laugh.\r\n\r\n"Did you get Randolph to go to bed?" asked the young girl.\r\n\r\n"No; I couldn\'t induce him," said Mrs. Miller very gently. "He wants to\r\ntalk to the waiter. He likes to talk to that waiter."\r\n\r\n"I was telling Mr. Winterbourne," the young girl went on; and to the\r\nyoung man\'s ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering\r\nhis name all her life.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" said Winterbourne; "I have the pleasure of knowing your son."\r\n\r\nRandolph\'s mamma was silent; she turned her attention to the lake. But\r\nat last she spoke. "Well, I don\'t see how he lives!"\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, it isn\'t so bad as it was at Dover," said Daisy Miller.\r\n\r\n"And what occurred at Dover?" Winterbourne asked.\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t go to bed at all. I guess he sat up all night in the public\r\nparlor. He wasn\'t in bed at twelve o\'clock: I know that."\r\n\r\n"It was half-past twelve," declared Mrs. Miller with mild emphasis.\r\n\r\n"Does he sleep much during the day?" Winterbourne demanded.\r\n\r\n"I guess he doesn\'t sleep much," Daisy rejoined.\r\n\r\n"I wish he would!" said her mother. "It seems as if he couldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I think he\'s real tiresome," Daisy pursued.\r\n\r\nThen, for some moments, there was silence. "Well, Daisy Miller," said\r\nthe elder lady, presently, "I shouldn\'t think you\'d want to talk against\r\nyour own brother!"\r\n\r\n"Well, he IS tiresome, Mother," said Daisy, quite without the asperity\r\nof a retort.\r\n\r\n"He\'s only nine," urged Mrs. Miller.\r\n\r\n"Well, he wouldn\'t go to that castle," said the young girl. "I\'m going\r\nthere with Mr. Winterbourne."\r\n\r\nTo this announcement, very placidly made, Daisy\'s mamma offered no\r\nresponse. Winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of\r\nthe projected excursion; but he said to himself that she was a simple,\r\neasily managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would\r\ntake the edge from her displeasure. "Yes," he began; "your daughter has\r\nkindly allowed me the honor of being her guide."\r\n\r\nMrs. Miller\'s wandering eyes attached themselves, with a sort of\r\nappealing air, to Daisy, who, however, strolled a few steps farther,\r\ngently humming to herself. "I presume you will go in the cars," said her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"Yes, or in the boat," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course, I don\'t know," Mrs. Miller rejoined. "I have never\r\nbeen to that castle."\r\n\r\n"It is a pity you shouldn\'t go," said Winterbourne, beginning to feel\r\nreassured as to her opposition. And yet he was quite prepared to find\r\nthat, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been thinking ever so much about going," she pursued; "but it\r\nseems as if we couldn\'t. Of course Daisy--she wants to go round. But\r\nthere\'s a lady here--I don\'t know her name--she says she shouldn\'t think\r\nwe\'d want to go to see castles HERE; she should think we\'d want to wait\r\ntill we got to Italy. It seems as if there would be so many there,"\r\ncontinued Mrs. Miller with an air of increasing confidence. "Of course\r\nwe only want to see the principal ones. We visited several in England,"\r\nshe presently added.\r\n\r\n"Ah yes! in England there are beautiful castles," said Winterbourne.\r\n"But Chillon here, is very well worth seeing."\r\n\r\n"Well, if Daisy feels up to it--" said Mrs. Miller, in a tone\r\nimpregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise. "It seems\r\nas if there was nothing she wouldn\'t undertake."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think she\'ll enjoy it!" Winterbourne declared. And he desired\r\nmore and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege\r\nof a tete-a-tete with the young lady, who was still strolling along\r\nin front of them, softly vocalizing. "You are not disposed, madam," he\r\ninquired, "to undertake it yourself?"\r\n\r\nDaisy\'s mother looked at him an instant askance, and then walked forward\r\nin silence. Then--"I guess she had better go alone," she said simply.\r\nWinterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of\r\nmaternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the\r\nforefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of\r\nthe lake. But his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very\r\ndistinctly pronounced by Mrs. Miller\'s unprotected daughter.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Winterbourne!" murmured Daisy.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle!" said the young man.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want to take me out in a boat?"\r\n\r\n"At present?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" said Daisy.\r\n\r\n"Well, Annie Miller!" exclaimed her mother.\r\n\r\n"I beg you, madam, to let her go," said Winterbourne ardently; for\r\nhe had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer\r\nstarlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t think she\'d want to," said her mother. "I should think\r\nshe\'d rather go indoors."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Mr. Winterbourne wants to take me," Daisy declared. "He\'s so\r\nawfully devoted!"\r\n\r\n"I will row you over to Chillon in the starlight."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it!" said Daisy.\r\n\r\n"Well!" ejaculated the elder lady again.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t spoken to me for half an hour," her daughter went on.\r\n\r\n"I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother,"\r\nsaid Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Well, I want you to take me out in a boat!" Daisy repeated. They had\r\nall stopped, and she had turned round and was looking at Winterbourne.\r\nHer face wore a charming smile, her pretty eyes were gleaming, she was\r\nswinging her great fan about. No; it\'s impossible to be prettier than\r\nthat, thought Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place," he said,\r\npointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake.\r\n"If you will do me the honor to accept my arm, we will go and select one\r\nof them."\r\n\r\nDaisy stood there smiling; she threw back her head and gave a little,\r\nlight laugh. "I like a gentleman to be formal!" she declared.\r\n\r\n"I assure you it\'s a formal offer."\r\n\r\n"I was bound I would make you say something," Daisy went on.\r\n\r\n"You see, it\'s not very difficult," said Winterbourne. "But I am afraid\r\nyou are chaffing me."\r\n\r\n"I think not, sir," remarked Mrs. Miller very gently.\r\n\r\n"Do, then, let me give you a row," he said to the young girl.\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite lovely, the way you say that!" cried Daisy.\r\n\r\n"It will be still more lovely to do it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it would be lovely!" said Daisy. But she made no movement to\r\naccompany him; she only stood there laughing.\r\n\r\n"I should think you had better find out what time it is," interposed her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"It is eleven o\'clock, madam," said a voice, with a foreign accent, out\r\nof the neighboring darkness; and Winterbourne, turning, perceived the\r\nflorid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. He had\r\napparently just approached.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Eugenio," said Daisy, "I am going out in a boat!"\r\n\r\nEugenio bowed. "At eleven o\'clock, mademoiselle?"\r\n\r\n"I am going with Mr. Winterbourne--this very minute."\r\n\r\n"Do tell her she can\'t," said Mrs. Miller to the courier.\r\n\r\n"I think you had better not go out in a boat, mademoiselle," Eugenio\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne wished to Heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with\r\nher courier; but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you don\'t think it\'s proper!" Daisy exclaimed. "Eugenio\r\ndoesn\'t think anything\'s proper."\r\n\r\n"I am at your service," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Does mademoiselle propose to go alone?" asked Eugenio of Mrs. Miller.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; with this gentleman!" answered Daisy\'s mamma.\r\n\r\nThe courier looked for a moment at Winterbourne--the latter thought he\r\nwas smiling--and then, solemnly, with a bow, "As mademoiselle pleases!"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hoped you would make a fuss!" said Daisy. "I don\'t care to go\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"I myself shall make a fuss if you don\'t go," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all I want--a little fuss!" And the young girl began to laugh\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Randolph has gone to bed!" the courier announced frigidly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Daisy; now we can go!" said Mrs. Miller.\r\n\r\nDaisy turned away from Winterbourne, looking at him, smiling and fanning\r\nherself. "Good night," she said; "I hope you are disappointed, or\r\ndisgusted, or something!"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, taking the hand she offered him. "I am puzzled," he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope it won\'t keep you awake!" she said very smartly; and,\r\nunder the escort of the privileged Eugenio, the two ladies passed toward\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne stood looking after them; he was indeed puzzled. He\r\nlingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour, turning over the\r\nmystery of the young girl\'s sudden familiarities and caprices. But\r\nthe only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy\r\ndeucedly "going off" with her somewhere.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward he went off with her to the Castle of Chillon. He\r\nwaited for her in the large hall of the hotel, where the couriers, the\r\nservants, the foreign tourists, were lounging about and staring. It was\r\nnot the place he should have chosen, but she had appointed it. She came\r\ntripping downstairs, buttoning her long gloves, squeezing her folded\r\nparasol against her pretty figure, dressed in the perfection of a\r\nsoberly elegant traveling costume. Winterbourne was a man of imagination\r\nand, as our ancestors used to say, sensibility; as he looked at her\r\ndress and, on the great staircase, her little rapid, confiding step, he\r\nfelt as if there were something romantic going forward. He could have\r\nbelieved he was going to elope with her. He passed out with her among\r\nall the idle people that were assembled there; they were all looking\r\nat her very hard; she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him.\r\nWinterbourne\'s preference had been that they should be conveyed to\r\nChillon in a carriage; but she expressed a lively wish to go in the\r\nlittle steamer; she declared that she had a passion for steamboats.\r\nThere was always such a lovely breeze upon the water, and you saw such\r\nlots of people. The sail was not long, but Winterbourne\'s companion\r\nfound time to say a great many things. To the young man himself their\r\nlittle excursion was so much of an escapade--an adventure--that, even\r\nallowing for her habitual sense of freedom, he had some expectation of\r\nseeing her regard it in the same way. But it must be confessed that,\r\nin this particular, he was disappointed. Daisy Miller was extremely\r\nanimated, she was in charming spirits; but she was apparently not at all\r\nexcited; she was not fluttered; she avoided neither his eyes nor those\r\nof anyone else; she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she\r\nfelt that people were looking at her. People continued to look at her\r\na great deal, and Winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty\r\ncompanion\'s distinguished air. He had been a little afraid that she\r\nwould talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about\r\nthe boat a good deal. But he quite forgot his fears; he sat smiling,\r\nwith his eyes upon her face, while, without moving from her place, she\r\ndelivered herself of a great number of original reflections. It was the\r\nmost charming garrulity he had ever heard. He had assented to the idea\r\nthat she was "common"; but was she so, after all, or was he simply\r\ngetting used to her commonness? Her conversation was chiefly of what\r\nmetaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a\r\nsubjective turn.\r\n\r\n"What on EARTH are you so grave about?" she suddenly demanded, fixing\r\nher agreeable eyes upon Winterbourne\'s.\r\n\r\n"Am I grave?" he asked. "I had an idea I was grinning from ear to ear."\r\n\r\n"You look as if you were taking me to a funeral. If that\'s a grin, your\r\nears are very near together."\r\n\r\n"Should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck?"\r\n\r\n"Pray do, and I\'ll carry round your hat. It will pay the expenses of our\r\njourney."\r\n\r\n"I never was better pleased in my life," murmured Winterbourne.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh. "I like\r\nto make you say those things! You\'re a queer mixture!"\r\n\r\nIn the castle, after they had landed, the subjective element decidedly\r\nprevailed. Daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers, rustled her skirts\r\nin the corkscrew staircases, flirted back with a pretty little cry and\r\na shudder from the edge of the oubliettes, and turned a singularly\r\nwell-shaped ear to everything that Winterbourne told her about the\r\nplace. But he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and\r\nthat the dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon\r\nher. They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without\r\nother companionship than that of the custodian; and Winterbourne\r\narranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried--that\r\nthey should linger and pause wherever they chose. The custodian\r\ninterpreted the bargain generously--Winterbourne, on his side, had been\r\ngenerous--and ended by leaving them quite to themselves. Miss Miller\'s\r\nobservations were not remarkable for logical consistency; for anything\r\nshe wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext. She found a great many\r\npretexts in the rugged embrasures of Chillon for asking Winterbourne\r\nsudden questions about himself--his family, his previous history, his\r\ntastes, his habits, his intentions--and for supplying information upon\r\ncorresponding points in her own personality. Of her own tastes, habits,\r\nand intentions Miss Miller was prepared to give the most definite, and\r\nindeed the most favorable account.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope you know enough!" she said to her companion, after he had\r\ntold her the history of the unhappy Bonivard. "I never saw a man that\r\nknew so much!" The history of Bonivard had evidently, as they say, gone\r\ninto one ear and out of the other. But Daisy went on to say that she\r\nwished Winterbourne would travel with them and "go round" with them;\r\nthey might know something, in that case. "Don\'t you want to come\r\nand teach Randolph?" she asked. Winterbourne said that nothing\r\ncould possibly please him so much, but that he had unfortunately other\r\noccupations. "Other occupations? I don\'t believe it!" said Miss Daisy.\r\n"What do you mean? You are not in business." The young man admitted that\r\nhe was not in business; but he had engagements which, even within a day\r\nor two, would force him to go back to Geneva. "Oh, bother!" she said; "I\r\ndon\'t believe it!" and she began to talk about something else. But a few\r\nmoments later, when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an\r\nantique fireplace, she broke out irrelevantly, "You don\'t mean to say\r\nyou are going back to Geneva?"\r\n\r\n"It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva\r\ntomorrow."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Winterbourne," said Daisy, "I think you\'re horrid!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t say such dreadful things!" said Winterbourne--"just at the\r\nlast!"\r\n\r\n"The last!" cried the young girl; "I call it the first. I have half a\r\nmind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone." And\r\nfor the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid. Poor\r\nWinterbourne was fairly bewildered; no young lady had as yet done him\r\nthe honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements. His\r\ncompanion, after this, ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of\r\nChillon or the beauties of the lake; she opened fire upon the mysterious\r\ncharmer in Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for\r\ngranted that he was hurrying back to see. How did Miss Daisy Miller\r\nknow that there was a charmer in Geneva? Winterbourne, who denied the\r\nexistence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he was\r\ndivided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement\r\nat the frankness of her persiflage. She seemed to him, in all this, an\r\nextraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity. "Does she never allow\r\nyou more than three days at a time?" asked Daisy ironically. "Doesn\'t\r\nshe give you a vacation in summer? There\'s no one so hard worked but\r\nthey can get leave to go off somewhere at this season. I suppose, if you\r\nstay another day, she\'ll come after you in the boat. Do wait over\r\ntill Friday, and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive!"\r\nWinterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in\r\nthe temper in which the young lady had embarked. If he had missed the\r\npersonal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance.\r\nIt sounded very distinctly, at last, in her telling him she would stop\r\n"teasing" him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not a difficult promise to make," said Winterbourne. "My aunt\r\nhas taken an apartment in Rome for the winter and has already asked me\r\nto come and see her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to come for your aunt," said Daisy; "I want you to\r\ncome for me." And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever\r\nto hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. He declared that, at\r\nany rate, he would certainly come. After this Daisy stopped teasing.\r\nWinterbourne took a carriage, and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk;\r\nthe young girl was very quiet.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Winterbourne mentioned to Mrs. Costello that he had spent\r\nthe afternoon at Chillon with Miss Daisy Miller.\r\n\r\n"The Americans--of the courier?" asked this lady.\r\n\r\n"Ah, happily," said Winterbourne, "the courier stayed at home."\r\n\r\n"She went with you all alone?"\r\n\r\n"All alone."\r\n\r\nMrs. Costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle. "And that," she\r\nexclaimed, "is the young person whom you wanted me to know!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nWinterbourne, who had returned to Geneva the day after his excursion\r\nto Chillon, went to Rome toward the end of January. His aunt had been\r\nestablished there for several weeks, and he had received a couple of\r\nletters from her. "Those people you were so devoted to last summer at\r\nVevey have turned up here, courier and all," she wrote. "They seem to\r\nhave made several acquaintances, but the courier continues to be the\r\nmost intime. The young lady, however, is also very intimate with some\r\nthird-rate Italians, with whom she rackets about in a way that makes\r\nmuch talk. Bring me that pretty novel of Cherbuliez\'s--Paule Mere--and\r\ndon\'t come later than the 23rd."\r\n\r\nIn the natural course of events, Winterbourne, on arriving in Rome,\r\nwould presently have ascertained Mrs. Miller\'s address at the American\r\nbanker\'s and have gone to pay his compliments to Miss Daisy. "After what\r\nhappened at Vevey, I think I may certainly call upon them," he said to\r\nMrs. Costello.\r\n\r\n"If, after what happens--at Vevey and everywhere--you desire to keep\r\nup the acquaintance, you are very welcome. Of course a man may know\r\neveryone. Men are welcome to the privilege!"\r\n\r\n"Pray what is it that happens--here, for instance?" Winterbourne\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n"The girl goes about alone with her foreigners. As to what happens\r\nfurther, you must apply elsewhere for information. She has picked up\r\nhalf a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters, and she takes them\r\nabout to people\'s houses. When she comes to a party she brings with her\r\na gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache."\r\n\r\n"And where is the mother?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea. They are very dreadful people."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne meditated a moment. "They are very ignorant--very innocent\r\nonly. Depend upon it they are not bad."\r\n\r\n"They are hopelessly vulgar," said Mrs. Costello. "Whether or no being\r\nhopelessly vulgar is being \'bad\' is a question for the metaphysicians.\r\nThey are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life\r\nthat is quite enough."\r\n\r\nThe news that Daisy Miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful\r\nmustaches checked Winterbourne\'s impulse to go straightway to see her.\r\nHe had, perhaps, not definitely flattered himself that he had made an\r\nineffaceable impression upon her heart, but he was annoyed at hearing\r\nof a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately\r\nflitted in and out of his own meditations; the image of a very pretty\r\ngirl looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently\r\nwhen Mr. Winterbourne would arrive. If, however, he determined to wait a\r\nlittle before reminding Miss Miller of his claims to her consideration,\r\nhe went very soon to call upon two or three other friends. One of these\r\nfriends was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva,\r\nwhere she had placed her children at school. She was a very accomplished\r\nwoman, and she lived in the Via Gregoriana. Winterbourne found her in a\r\nlittle crimson drawing room on a third floor; the room was filled with\r\nsouthern sunshine. He had not been there ten minutes when the servant\r\ncame in, announcing "Madame Mila!" This announcement was presently\r\nfollowed by the entrance of little Randolph Miller, who stopped in the\r\nmiddle of the room and stood staring at Winterbourne. An instant later\r\nhis pretty sister crossed the threshold; and then, after a considerable\r\ninterval, Mrs. Miller slowly advanced.\r\n\r\n"I know you!" said Randolph.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you know a great many things," exclaimed Winterbourne, taking\r\nhim by the hand. "How is your education coming on?"\r\n\r\nDaisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess, but when\r\nshe heard Winterbourne\'s voice she quickly turned her head. "Well, I\r\ndeclare!" she said.\r\n\r\n"I told you I should come, you know," Winterbourne rejoined, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t believe it," said Miss Daisy.\r\n\r\n"I am much obliged to you," laughed the young man.\r\n\r\n"You might have come to see me!" said Daisy.\r\n\r\n"I arrived only yesterday."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that!" the young girl declared.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother, but this lady\r\nevaded his glance, and, seating herself, fixed her eyes upon her son.\r\n"We\'ve got a bigger place than this," said Randolph. "It\'s all gold on\r\nthe walls."\r\n\r\nMrs. Miller turned uneasily in her chair. "I told you if I were to bring\r\nyou, you would say something!" she murmured.\r\n\r\n"I told YOU!" Randolph exclaimed. "I tell YOU, sir!" he added jocosely,\r\ngiving Winterbourne a thump on the knee. "It IS bigger, too!"\r\n\r\nDaisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess;\r\nWinterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother. "I\r\nhope you have been well since we parted at Vevey," he said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Miller now certainly looked at him--at his chin. "Not very well,\r\nsir," she answered.\r\n\r\n"She\'s got the dyspepsia," said Randolph. "I\'ve got it too. Father\'s got\r\nit. I\'ve got it most!"\r\n\r\nThis announcement, instead of embarrassing Mrs. Miller, seemed to\r\nrelieve her. "I suffer from the liver," she said. "I think it\'s this\r\nclimate; it\'s less bracing than Schenectady, especially in the winter\r\nseason. I don\'t know whether you know we reside at Schenectady. I was\r\nsaying to Daisy that I certainly hadn\'t found any one like Dr. Davis,\r\nand I didn\'t believe I should. Oh, at Schenectady he stands first; they\r\nthink everything of him. He has so much to do, and yet there was nothing\r\nhe wouldn\'t do for me. He said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia,\r\nbut he was bound to cure it. I\'m sure there was nothing he wouldn\'t\r\ntry. He was just going to try something new when we came off. Mr. Miller\r\nwanted Daisy to see Europe for herself. But I wrote to Mr. Miller that\r\nit seems as if I couldn\'t get on without Dr. Davis. At Schenectady he\r\nstands at the very top; and there\'s a great deal of sickness there, too.\r\nIt affects my sleep."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with Dr. Davis\'s\r\npatient, during which Daisy chattered unremittingly to her own\r\ncompanion. The young man asked Mrs. Miller how she was pleased with\r\nRome. "Well, I must say I am disappointed," she answered. "We had heard\r\nso much about it; I suppose we had heard too much. But we couldn\'t help\r\nthat. We had been led to expect something different."\r\n\r\n"Ah, wait a little, and you will become very fond of it," said\r\nWinterbourne.\r\n\r\n"I hate it worse and worse every day!" cried Randolph.\r\n\r\n"You are like the infant Hannibal," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t!" Randolph declared at a venture.\r\n\r\n"You are not much like an infant," said his mother. "But we have seen\r\nplaces," she resumed, "that I should put a long way before Rome." And in\r\nreply to Winterbourne\'s interrogation, "There\'s Zurich," she concluded,\r\n"I think Zurich is lovely; and we hadn\'t heard half so much about it."\r\n\r\n"The best place we\'ve seen is the City of Richmond!" said Randolph.\r\n\r\n"He means the ship," his mother explained. "We crossed in that ship.\r\nRandolph had a good time on the City of Richmond."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the best place I\'ve seen," the child repeated. "Only it was turned\r\nthe wrong way."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve got to turn the right way some time," said Mrs. Miller with\r\na little laugh. Winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at\r\nleast found some gratification in Rome, and she declared that Daisy\r\nwas quite carried away. "It\'s on account of the society--the society\'s\r\nsplendid. She goes round everywhere; she has made a great number of\r\nacquaintances. Of course she goes round more than I do. I must say they\r\nhave been very sociable; they have taken her right in. And then she\r\nknows a great many gentlemen. Oh, she thinks there\'s nothing like Rome.\r\nOf course, it\'s a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows\r\nplenty of gentlemen."\r\n\r\nBy this time Daisy had turned her attention again to Winterbourne. "I\'ve\r\nbeen telling Mrs. Walker how mean you were!" the young girl announced.\r\n\r\n"And what is the evidence you have offered?" asked Winterbourne, rather\r\nannoyed at Miss Miller\'s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer\r\nwho on his way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at\r\nFlorence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience. He\r\nremembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that American\r\nwomen--the pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiom--were at\r\nonce the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense\r\nof indebtedness.\r\n\r\n"Why, you were awfully mean at Vevey," said Daisy. "You wouldn\'t do\r\nanything. You wouldn\'t stay there when I asked you."\r\n\r\n"My dearest young lady," cried Winterbourne, with eloquence, "have I\r\ncome all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches?"\r\n\r\n"Just hear him say that!" said Daisy to her hostess, giving a twist to a\r\nbow on this lady\'s dress. "Did you ever hear anything so quaint?"\r\n\r\n"So quaint, my dear?" murmured Mrs. Walker in the tone of a partisan of\r\nWinterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," said Daisy, fingering Mrs. Walker\'s ribbons. "Mrs.\r\nWalker, I want to tell you something."\r\n\r\n"Mother-r," interposed Randolph, with his rough ends to his words, "I\r\ntell you you\'ve got to go. Eugenio\'ll raise--something!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid of Eugenio," said Daisy with a toss of her head. "Look\r\nhere, Mrs. Walker," she went on, "you know I\'m coming to your party."\r\n\r\n"I am delighted to hear it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a lovely dress!"\r\n\r\n"I am very sure of that."\r\n\r\n"But I want to ask a favor--permission to bring a friend."\r\n\r\n"I shall be happy to see any of your friends," said Mrs. Walker, turning\r\nwith a smile to Mrs. Miller.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they are not my friends," answered Daisy\'s mamma, smiling shyly in\r\nher own fashion. "I never spoke to them."\r\n\r\n"It\'s an intimate friend of mine--Mr. Giovanelli," said Daisy without\r\na tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little\r\nface.\r\n\r\nMrs. Walker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at\r\nWinterbourne. "I shall be glad to see Mr. Giovanelli," she then said.\r\n\r\n"He\'s an Italian," Daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity. "He\'s a\r\ngreat friend of mine; he\'s the handsomest man in the world--except Mr.\r\nWinterbourne! He knows plenty of Italians, but he wants to know some\r\nAmericans. He thinks ever so much of Americans. He\'s tremendously\r\nclever. He\'s perfectly lovely!"\r\n\r\nIt was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to Mrs.\r\nWalker\'s party, and then Mrs. Miller prepared to take her leave. "I\r\nguess we\'ll go back to the hotel," she said.\r\n\r\n"You may go back to the hotel, Mother, but I\'m going to take a walk,"\r\nsaid Daisy.\r\n\r\n"She\'s going to walk with Mr. Giovanelli," Randolph proclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I am going to the Pincio," said Daisy, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Alone, my dear--at this hour?" Mrs. Walker asked. The afternoon was\r\ndrawing to a close--it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of\r\ncontemplative pedestrians. "I don\'t think it\'s safe, my dear," said Mrs.\r\nWalker.\r\n\r\n"Neither do I," subjoined Mrs. Miller. "You\'ll get the fever, as sure as\r\nyou live. Remember what Dr. Davis told you!"\r\n\r\n"Give her some medicine before she goes," said Randolph.\r\n\r\nThe company had risen to its feet; Daisy, still showing her pretty\r\nteeth, bent over and kissed her hostess. "Mrs. Walker, you are too\r\nperfect," she said. "I\'m not going alone; I am going to meet a friend."\r\n\r\n"Your friend won\'t keep you from getting the fever," Mrs. Miller\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n"Is it Mr. Giovanelli?" asked the hostess.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his attention\r\nquickened. She stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons;\r\nshe glanced at Winterbourne. Then, while she glanced and smiled, she\r\nanswered, without a shade of hesitation, "Mr. Giovanelli--the beautiful\r\nGiovanelli."\r\n\r\n"My dear young friend," said Mrs. Walker, taking her hand pleadingly,\r\n"don\'t walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian."\r\n\r\n"Well, he speaks English," said Mrs. Miller.\r\n\r\n"Gracious me!" Daisy exclaimed, "I don\'t to do anything improper.\r\nThere\'s an easy way to settle it." She continued to glance at\r\nWinterbourne. "The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant; and if Mr.\r\nWinterbourne were as polite as he pretends, he would offer to walk with\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne\'s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl\r\ngave him gracious leave to accompany her. They passed downstairs\r\nbefore her mother, and at the door Winterbourne perceived Mrs. Miller\'s\r\ncarriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had\r\nmade at Vevey seated within. "Goodbye, Eugenio!" cried Daisy; "I\'m going\r\nto take a walk." The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful\r\ngarden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is, in fact, rapidly\r\ntraversed. As the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of\r\nvehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young Americans found\r\ntheir progress much delayed. This fact was highly agreeable to\r\nWinterbourne, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation.\r\nThe slow-moving, idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon\r\nthe extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon\r\nhis arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in Daisy\'s mind when\r\nshe proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation. His own\r\nmission, to her sense, apparently, was to consign her to the hands\r\nof Mr. Giovanelli; but Winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified,\r\nresolved that he would do no such thing.\r\n\r\n"Why haven\'t you been to see me?" asked Daisy. "You can\'t get out of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out\r\nof the train."\r\n\r\n"You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!" cried\r\nthe young girl with her little laugh. "I suppose you were asleep. You\r\nhave had time to go to see Mrs. Walker."\r\n\r\n"I knew Mrs. Walker--" Winterbourne began to explain.\r\n\r\n"I know where you knew her. You knew her at Geneva. She told me so.\r\nWell, you knew me at Vevey. That\'s just as good. So you ought to have\r\ncome." She asked him no other question than this; she began to prattle\r\nabout her own affairs. "We\'ve got splendid rooms at the hotel; Eugenio\r\nsays they\'re the best rooms in Rome. We are going to stay all winter,\r\nif we don\'t die of the fever; and I guess we\'ll stay then. It\'s a great\r\ndeal nicer than I thought; I thought it would be fearfully quiet; I was\r\nsure it would be awfully poky. I was sure we should be going round\r\nall the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the\r\npictures and things. But we only had about a week of that, and now\r\nI\'m enjoying myself. I know ever so many people, and they are all so\r\ncharming. The society\'s extremely select. There are all kinds--English,\r\nand Germans, and Italians. I think I like the English best. I like their\r\nstyle of conversation. But there are some lovely Americans. I never saw\r\nanything so hospitable. There\'s something or other every day. There\'s\r\nnot much dancing; but I must say I never thought dancing was everything.\r\nI was always fond of conversation. I guess I shall have plenty at Mrs.\r\nWalker\'s, her rooms are so small." When they had passed the gate of the\r\nPincian Gardens, Miss Miller began to wonder where Mr. Giovanelli might\r\nbe. "We had better go straight to that place in front," she said, "where\r\nyou look at the view."\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall not help you to find him," Winterbourne declared.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall find him without you," cried Miss Daisy.\r\n\r\n"You certainly won\'t leave me!" cried Winterbourne.\r\n\r\nShe burst into her little laugh. "Are you afraid you\'ll get lost--or run\r\nover? But there\'s Giovanelli, leaning against that tree. He\'s staring at\r\nthe women in the carriages: did you ever see anything so cool?"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with\r\nfolded arms nursing his cane. He had a handsome face, an artfully poised\r\nhat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole. Winterbourne\r\nlooked at him a moment and then said, "Do you mean to speak to that\r\nman?"\r\n\r\n"Do I mean to speak to him? Why, you don\'t suppose I mean to communicate\r\nby signs?"\r\n\r\n"Pray understand, then," said Winterbourne, "that I intend to remain\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\nDaisy stopped and looked at him, without a sign of troubled\r\nconsciousness in her face, with nothing but the presence of her charming\r\neyes and her happy dimples. "Well, she\'s a cool one!" thought the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like the way you say that," said Daisy. "It\'s too imperious."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon if I say it wrong. The main point is to give you an\r\nidea of my meaning."\r\n\r\nThe young girl looked at him more gravely, but with eyes that were\r\nprettier than ever. "I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me,\r\nor to interfere with anything I do."\r\n\r\n"I think you have made a mistake," said Winterbourne. "You should\r\nsometimes listen to a gentleman--the right one."\r\n\r\nDaisy began to laugh again. "I do nothing but listen to gentlemen!" she\r\nexclaimed. "Tell me if Mr. Giovanelli is the right one?"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two\r\nfriends, and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity.\r\nHe bowed to Winterbourne as well as to the latter\'s companion; he had\r\na brilliant smile, an intelligent eye; Winterbourne thought him not a\r\nbad-looking fellow. But he nevertheless said to Daisy, "No, he\'s not the\r\nright one."\r\n\r\nDaisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions; she\r\nmentioned the name of each of her companions to the other. She strolled\r\nalone with one of them on each side of her; Mr. Giovanelli, who spoke\r\nEnglish very cleverly--Winterbourne afterward learned that he had\r\npracticed the idiom upon a great many American heiresses--addressed her\r\na great deal of very polite nonsense; he was extremely urbane, and the\r\nyoung American, who said nothing, reflected upon that profundity of\r\nItalian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in\r\nproportion as they are more acutely disappointed. Giovanelli, of course,\r\nhad counted upon something more intimate; he had not bargained for\r\na party of three. But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested\r\nfar-stretching intentions. Winterbourne flattered himself that he had\r\ntaken his measure. "He is not a gentleman," said the young American;\r\n"he is only a clever imitation of one. He is a music master, or a\r\npenny-a-liner, or a third-rate artist. D__n his good looks!" Mr.\r\nGiovanelli had certainly a very pretty face; but Winterbourne felt a\r\nsuperior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman\'s not knowing\r\nthe difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one. Giovanelli\r\nchattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable. It was\r\ntrue that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant.\r\n"Nevertheless," Winterbourne said to himself, "a nice girl ought to\r\nknow!" And then he came back to the question whether this was, in fact,\r\na nice girl. Would a nice girl, even allowing for her being a little\r\nAmerican flirt, make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner?\r\nThe rendezvous in this case, indeed, had been in broad daylight and in\r\nthe most crowded corner of Rome, but was it not impossible to regard the\r\nchoice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism? Singular\r\nthough it may seem, Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl, in\r\njoining her amoroso, should not appear more impatient of his own\r\ncompany, and he was vexed because of his inclination. It was impossible\r\nto regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady; she was wanting\r\nin a certain indispensable delicacy. It would therefore simplify matters\r\ngreatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments\r\nwhich are called by romancers "lawless passions." That she should seem\r\nto wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her,\r\nand to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less\r\nperplexing. But Daisy, on this occasion, continued to present herself as\r\nan inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.\r\n\r\nShe had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her two\r\ncavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it\r\nseemed to Winterbourne, to the pretty speeches of Mr. Giovanelli, when\r\na carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up\r\nbeside the path. At the same moment Winterbourne perceived that his\r\nfriend Mrs. Walker--the lady whose house he had lately left--was seated\r\nin the vehicle and was beckoning to him. Leaving Miss Miller\'s side,\r\nhe hastened to obey her summons. Mrs. Walker was flushed; she wore an\r\nexcited air. "It is really too dreadful," she said. "That girl must not\r\ndo this sort of thing. She must not walk here with you two men. Fifty\r\npeople have noticed her."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne raised his eyebrows. "I think it\'s a pity to make too much\r\nfuss about it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity to let the girl ruin herself!"\r\n\r\n"She is very innocent," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"She\'s very crazy!" cried Mrs. Walker. "Did you ever see anything so\r\nimbecile as her mother? After you had all left me just now, I could not\r\nsit still for thinking of it. It seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt\r\nto save her. I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here\r\nas quickly as possible. Thank Heaven I have found you!"\r\n\r\n"What do you propose to do with us?" asked Winterbourne, smiling.\r\n\r\n"To ask her to get in, to drive her about here for half an hour, so that\r\nthe world may see she is not running absolutely wild, and then to take\r\nher safely home."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it\'s a very happy thought," said Winterbourne; "but you\r\ncan try."\r\n\r\nMrs. Walker tried. The young man went in pursuit of Miss Miller, who\r\nhad simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and\r\nhad gone her way with her companion. Daisy, on learning that Mrs. Walker\r\nwished to speak to her, retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and\r\nwith Mr. Giovanelli at her side. She declared that she was delighted to\r\nhave a chance to present this gentleman to Mrs. Walker. She immediately\r\nachieved the introduction, and declared that she had never in her life\r\nseen anything so lovely as Mrs. Walker\'s carriage rug.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you admire it," said this lady, smiling sweetly. "Will you\r\nget in and let me put it over you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, thank you," said Daisy. "I shall admire it much more as I see\r\nyou driving round with it."\r\n\r\n"Do get in and drive with me!" said Mrs. Walker.\r\n\r\n"That would be charming, but it\'s so enchanting just as I am!" and Daisy\r\ngave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her.\r\n\r\n"It may be enchanting, dear child, but it is not the custom here," urged\r\nMrs. Walker, leaning forward in her victoria, with her hands devoutly\r\nclasped.\r\n\r\n"Well, it ought to be, then!" said Daisy. "If I didn\'t walk I should\r\nexpire."\r\n\r\n"You should walk with your mother, dear," cried the lady from Geneva,\r\nlosing patience.\r\n\r\n"With my mother dear!" exclaimed the young girl. Winterbourne saw that\r\nshe scented interference. "My mother never walked ten steps in her life.\r\nAnd then, you know," she added with a laugh, "I am more than five years\r\nold."\r\n\r\n"You are old enough to be more reasonable. You are old enough, dear Miss\r\nMiller, to be talked about."\r\n\r\nDaisy looked at Mrs. Walker, smiling intensely. "Talked about? What do\r\nyou mean?"\r\n\r\n"Come into my carriage, and I will tell you."\r\n\r\nDaisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside\r\nher to the other. Mr. Giovanelli was bowing to and fro, rubbing down\r\nhis gloves and laughing very agreeably; Winterbourne thought it a most\r\nunpleasant scene. "I don\'t think I want to know what you mean," said\r\nDaisy presently. "I don\'t think I should like it."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne wished that Mrs. Walker would tuck in her carriage rug and\r\ndrive away, but this lady did not enjoy being defied, as she afterward\r\ntold him. "Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl?" she\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n"Gracious!" exclaimed Daisy. She looked again at Mr. Giovanelli, then\r\nshe turned to Winterbourne. There was a little pink flush in her cheek;\r\nshe was tremendously pretty. "Does Mr. Winterbourne think," she asked\r\nslowly, smiling, throwing back her head, and glancing at him from\r\nhead to foot, "that, to save my reputation, I ought to get into the\r\ncarriage?"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne colored; for an instant he hesitated greatly. It seemed so\r\nstrange to hear her speak that way of her "reputation." But he himself,\r\nin fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry. The finest gallantry,\r\nhere, was simply to tell her the truth; and the truth, for Winterbourne,\r\nas the few indications I have been able to give have made him known to\r\nthe reader, was that Daisy Miller should take Mrs. Walker\'s advice. He\r\nlooked at her exquisite prettiness, and then he said, very gently, "I\r\nthink you should get into the carriage."\r\n\r\nDaisy gave a violent laugh. "I never heard anything so stiff! If this\r\nis improper, Mrs. Walker," she pursued, "then I am all improper, and you\r\nmust give me up. Goodbye; I hope you\'ll have a lovely ride!" and, with\r\nMr. Giovanelli, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMrs. Walker sat looking after her, and there were tears in Mrs. Walker\'s\r\neyes. "Get in here, sir," she said to Winterbourne, indicating the place\r\nbeside her. The young man answered that he felt bound to accompany Miss\r\nMiller, whereupon Mrs. Walker declared that if he refused her this\r\nfavor she would never speak to him again. She was evidently in earnest.\r\nWinterbourne overtook Daisy and her companion, and, offering the young\r\ngirl his hand, told her that Mrs. Walker had made an imperious claim\r\nupon his society. He expected that in answer she would say something\r\nrather free, something to commit herself still further to that\r\n"recklessness" from which Mrs. Walker had so charitably endeavored to\r\ndissuade her. But she only shook his hand, hardly looking at him, while\r\nMr. Giovanelli bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in\r\nMrs. Walker\'s victoria. "That was not clever of you," he said candidly,\r\nwhile the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages.\r\n\r\n"In such a case," his companion answered, "I don\'t wish to be clever; I\r\nwish to be EARNEST!"\r\n\r\n"Well, your earnestness has only offended her and put her off."\r\n\r\n"It has happened very well," said Mrs. Walker. "If she is so perfectly\r\ndetermined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better;\r\none can act accordingly."\r\n\r\n"I suspect she meant no harm," Winterbourne rejoined.\r\n\r\n"So I thought a month ago. But she has been going too far."\r\n\r\n"What has she been doing?"\r\n\r\n"Everything that is not done here. Flirting with any man she could pick\r\nup; sitting in corners with mysterious Italians; dancing all the evening\r\nwith the same partners; receiving visits at eleven o\'clock at night. Her\r\nmother goes away when visitors come."\r\n\r\n"But her brother," said Winterbourne, laughing, "sits up till midnight."\r\n\r\n"He must be edified by what he sees. I\'m told that at their hotel\r\neveryone is talking about her, and that a smile goes round among all the\r\nservants when a gentleman comes and asks for Miss Miller."\r\n\r\n"The servants be hanged!" said Winterbourne angrily. "The poor girl\'s\r\nonly fault," he presently added, "is that she is very uncultivated."\r\n\r\n"She is naturally indelicate," Mrs. Walker declared.\r\n\r\n"Take that example this morning. How long had you known her at Vevey?"\r\n\r\n"A couple of days."\r\n\r\n"Fancy, then, her making it a personal matter that you should have left\r\nthe place!"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was silent for some moments; then he said, "I suspect, Mrs.\r\nWalker, that you and I have lived too long at Geneva!" And he added a\r\nrequest that she should inform him with what particular design she had\r\nmade him enter her carriage.\r\n\r\n"I wished to beg you to cease your relations with Miss Miller--not to\r\nflirt with her--to give her no further opportunity to expose herself--to\r\nlet her alone, in short."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I can\'t do that," said Winterbourne. "I like her extremely."\r\n\r\n"All the more reason that you shouldn\'t help her to make a scandal."\r\n\r\n"There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her."\r\n\r\n"There certainly will be in the way she takes them. But I have said what\r\nI had on my conscience," Mrs. Walker pursued. "If you wish to rejoin the\r\nyoung lady I will put you down. Here, by the way, you have a chance."\r\n\r\nThe carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that\r\noverhangs the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese.\r\nIt is bordered by a large parapet, near which there are several seats.\r\nOne of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady,\r\ntoward whom Mrs. Walker gave a toss of her head. At the same moment\r\nthese persons rose and walked toward the parapet. Winterbourne had asked\r\nthe coachman to stop; he now descended from the carriage. His companion\r\nlooked at him a moment in silence; then, while he raised his hat, she\r\ndrove majestically away. Winterbourne stood there; he had turned his\r\neyes toward Daisy and her cavalier. They evidently saw no one; they were\r\ntoo deeply occupied with each other. When they reached the low garden\r\nwall, they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine\r\nclusters of the Villa Borghese; then Giovanelli seated himself,\r\nfamiliarly, upon the broad ledge of the wall. The western sun in the\r\nopposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars,\r\nwhereupon Daisy\'s companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened\r\nit. She came a little nearer, and he held the parasol over her; then,\r\nstill holding it, he let it rest upon her shoulder, so that both of\r\ntheir heads were hidden from Winterbourne. This young man lingered a\r\nmoment, then he began to walk. But he walked--not toward the couple with\r\nthe parasol; toward the residence of his aunt, Mrs. Costello.\r\n\r\nHe flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling\r\namong the servants when he, at least, asked for Mrs. Miller at her\r\nhotel. This lady and her daughter, however, were not at home; and on\r\nthe next day after, repeating his visit, Winterbourne again had the\r\nmisfortune not to find them. Mrs. Walker\'s party took place on the\r\nevening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his last\r\ninterview with the hostess, Winterbourne was among the guests. Mrs.\r\nWalker was one of those American ladies who, while residing abroad, make\r\na point, in their own phrase, of studying European society, and she\r\nhad on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born\r\nfellow mortals to serve, as it were, as textbooks. When Winterbourne\r\narrived, Daisy Miller was not there, but in a few moments he saw her\r\nmother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. Mrs. Miller\'s hair\r\nabove her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever. As she\r\napproached Mrs. Walker, Winterbourne also drew near.\r\n\r\n"You see, I\'ve come all alone," said poor Mrs. Miller. "I\'m so\r\nfrightened; I don\'t know what to do. It\'s the first time I\'ve ever been\r\nto a party alone, especially in this country. I wanted to bring Randolph\r\nor Eugenio, or someone, but Daisy just pushed me off by myself. I ain\'t\r\nused to going round alone."\r\n\r\n"And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society?"\r\ndemanded Mrs. Walker impressively.\r\n\r\n"Well, Daisy\'s all dressed," said Mrs. Miller with that accent of the\r\ndispassionate, if not of the philosophic, historian with which she\r\nalways recorded the current incidents of her daughter\'s career. "She got\r\ndressed on purpose before dinner. But she\'s got a friend of hers there;\r\nthat gentleman--the Italian--that she wanted to bring. They\'ve got going\r\nat the piano; it seems as if they couldn\'t leave off. Mr. Giovanelli\r\nsings splendidly. But I guess they\'ll come before very long," concluded\r\nMrs. Miller hopefully.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry she should come in that way," said Mrs. Walker.\r\n\r\n"Well, I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before\r\ndinner if she was going to wait three hours," responded Daisy\'s mamma.\r\n"I didn\'t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit\r\nround with Mr. Giovanelli."\r\n\r\n"This is most horrible!" said Mrs. Walker, turning away and addressing\r\nherself to Winterbourne. "Elle s\'affiche. It\'s her revenge for my having\r\nventured to remonstrate with her. When she comes, I shall not speak to\r\nher."\r\n\r\nDaisy came after eleven o\'clock; but she was not, on such an occasion,\r\na young lady to wait to be spoken to. She rustled forward in radiant\r\nloveliness, smiling and chattering, carrying a large bouquet, and\r\nattended by Mr. Giovanelli. Everyone stopped talking and turned and\r\nlooked at her. She came straight to Mrs. Walker. "I\'m afraid you thought\r\nI never was coming, so I sent mother off to tell you. I wanted to make\r\nMr. Giovanelli practice some things before he came; you know he sings\r\nbeautifully, and I want you to ask him to sing. This is Mr. Giovanelli;\r\nyou know I introduced him to you; he\'s got the most lovely voice, and\r\nhe knows the most charming set of songs. I made him go over them this\r\nevening on purpose; we had the greatest time at the hotel." Of all\r\nthis Daisy delivered herself with the sweetest, brightest audibleness,\r\nlooking now at her hostess and now round the room, while she gave a\r\nseries of little pats, round her shoulders, to the edges of her dress.\r\n"Is there anyone I know?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I think every one knows you!" said Mrs. Walker pregnantly, and she gave\r\na very cursory greeting to Mr. Giovanelli. This gentleman bore himself\r\ngallantly. He smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth; he curled his\r\nmustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions\r\nof a handsome Italian at an evening party. He sang very prettily half\r\na dozen songs, though Mrs. Walker afterward declared that she had been\r\nquite unable to find out who asked him. It was apparently not Daisy who\r\nhad given him his orders. Daisy sat at a distance from the piano, and\r\nthough she had publicly, as it were, professed a high admiration for his\r\nsinging, talked, not inaudibly, while it was going on.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity these rooms are so small; we can\'t dance," she said to\r\nWinterbourne, as if she had seen him five minutes before.\r\n\r\n"I am not sorry we can\'t dance," Winterbourne answered; "I don\'t dance."\r\n\r\n"Of course you don\'t dance; you\'re too stiff," said Miss Daisy. "I hope\r\nyou enjoyed your drive with Mrs. Walker!"\r\n\r\n"No. I didn\'t enjoy it; I preferred walking with you."\r\n\r\n"We paired off: that was much better," said Daisy. "But did you ever\r\nhear anything so cool as Mrs. Walker\'s wanting me to get into her\r\ncarriage and drop poor Mr. Giovanelli, and under the pretext that it was\r\nproper? People have different ideas! It would have been most unkind; he\r\nhad been talking about that walk for ten days."\r\n\r\n"He should not have talked about it at all," said Winterbourne; "he\r\nwould never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about\r\nthe streets with him."\r\n\r\n"About the streets?" cried Daisy with her pretty stare. "Where, then,\r\nwould he have proposed to her to walk? The Pincio is not the streets,\r\neither; and I, thank goodness, am not a young lady of this country. The\r\nyoung ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it, so far\r\nas I can learn; I don\'t see why I should change my habits for THEM."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt," said Winterbourne\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n"Of course they are," she cried, giving him her little smiling stare\r\nagain. "I\'m a fearful, frightful flirt! Did you ever hear of a nice girl\r\nthat was not? But I suppose you will tell me now that I am not a nice\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a very nice girl; but I wish you would flirt with me, and me\r\nonly," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Ah! thank you--thank you very much; you are the last man I should think\r\nof flirting with. As I have had the pleasure of informing you, you are\r\ntoo stiff."\r\n\r\n"You say that too often," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\nDaisy gave a delighted laugh. "If I could have the sweet hope of making\r\nyou angry, I should say it again."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that; when I am angry I\'m stiffer than ever. But if you won\'t\r\nflirt with me, do cease, at least, to flirt with your friend at the\r\npiano; they don\'t understand that sort of thing here."\r\n\r\n"I thought they understood nothing else!" exclaimed Daisy.\r\n\r\n"Not in young unmarried women."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old\r\nmarried ones," Daisy declared.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Winterbourne, "when you deal with natives you must go\r\nby the custom of the place. Flirting is a purely American custom;\r\nit doesn\'t exist here. So when you show yourself in public with Mr.\r\nGiovanelli, and without your mother--"\r\n\r\n"Gracious! poor Mother!" interposed Daisy.\r\n\r\n"Though you may be flirting, Mr. Giovanelli is not; he means something\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t preaching, at any rate," said Daisy with vivacity. "And if you\r\nwant very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good\r\nfriends for that: we are very intimate friends."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" rejoined Winterbourne, "if you are in love with each other, it is\r\nanother affair."\r\n\r\nShe had allowed him up to this point to talk so frankly that he had no\r\nexpectation of shocking her by this ejaculation; but she immediately got\r\nup, blushing visibly, and leaving him to exclaim mentally that\r\nlittle American flirts were the queerest creatures in the world. "Mr.\r\nGiovanelli, at least," she said, giving her interlocutor a single\r\nglance, "never says such very disagreeable things to me."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne was bewildered; he stood, staring. Mr. Giovanelli had\r\nfinished singing. He left the piano and came over to Daisy. "Won\'t you\r\ncome into the other room and have some tea?" he asked, bending before\r\nher with his ornamental smile.\r\n\r\nDaisy turned to Winterbourne, beginning to smile again. He was still\r\nmore perplexed, for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear, though\r\nit seemed to prove, indeed, that she had a sweetness and softness that\r\nreverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses. "It has never occurred\r\nto Mr. Winterbourne to offer me any tea," she said with her little\r\ntormenting manner.\r\n\r\n"I have offered you advice," Winterbourne rejoined.\r\n\r\n"I prefer weak tea!" cried Daisy, and she went off with the brilliant\r\nGiovanelli. She sat with him in the adjoining room, in the embrasure\r\nof the window, for the rest of the evening. There was an interesting\r\nperformance at the piano, but neither of these young people gave heed\r\nto it. When Daisy came to take leave of Mrs. Walker, this lady\r\nconscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at\r\nthe moment of the young girl\'s arrival. She turned her back straight\r\nupon Miss Miller and left her to depart with what grace she might.\r\nWinterbourne was standing near the door; he saw it all. Daisy turned\r\nvery pale and looked at her mother, but Mrs. Miller was humbly\r\nunconscious of any violation of the usual social forms. She appeared,\r\nindeed, to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own\r\nstriking observance of them. "Good night, Mrs. Walker," she said; "we\'ve\r\nhad a beautiful evening. You see, if I let Daisy come to parties without\r\nme, I don\'t want her to go away without me." Daisy turned away, looking\r\nwith a pale, grave face at the circle near the door; Winterbourne saw\r\nthat, for the first moment, she was too much shocked and puzzled even\r\nfor indignation. He on his side was greatly touched.\r\n\r\n"That was very cruel," he said to Mrs. Walker.\r\n\r\n"She never enters my drawing room again!" replied his hostess.\r\n\r\nSince Winterbourne was not to meet her in Mrs. Walker\'s drawing room, he\r\nwent as often as possible to Mrs. Miller\'s hotel. The ladies were rarely\r\nat home, but when he found them, the devoted Giovanelli was always\r\npresent. Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room\r\nwith Daisy alone, Mrs. Miller being apparently constantly of the opinion\r\nthat discretion is the better part of surveillance. Winterbourne\r\nnoted, at first with surprise, that Daisy on these occasions was never\r\nembarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance; but he very presently began\r\nto feel that she had no more surprises for him; the unexpected in her\r\nbehavior was the only thing to expect. She showed no displeasure at\r\nher tete-a-tete with Giovanelli being interrupted; she could chatter as\r\nfreshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one; there was always,\r\nin her conversation, the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility.\r\nWinterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in\r\nGiovanelli, it was very singular that she should not take more trouble\r\nto preserve the sanctity of their interviews; and he liked her the more\r\nfor her innocent-looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible\r\ngood humor. He could hardly have said why, but she seemed to him a girl\r\nwho would never be jealous. At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive\r\nsmile on the reader\'s part, I may affirm that with regard to the women\r\nwho had hitherto interested him, it very often seemed to Winterbourne\r\namong the possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he should be\r\nafraid--literally afraid--of these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that\r\nhe should never be afraid of Daisy Miller. It must be added that this\r\nsentiment was not altogether flattering to Daisy; it was part of his\r\nconviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very\r\nlight young person.\r\n\r\nBut she was evidently very much interested in Giovanelli. She looked at\r\nhim whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling him to do this and\r\nto do that; she was constantly "chaffing" and abusing him. She appeared\r\ncompletely to have forgotten that Winterbourne had said anything to\r\ndisplease her at Mrs. Walker\'s little party. One Sunday afternoon,\r\nhaving gone to St. Peter\'s with his aunt, Winterbourne perceived\r\nDaisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable\r\nGiovanelli. Presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to\r\nMrs. Costello. This lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass,\r\nand then she said:\r\n\r\n"That\'s what makes you so pensive in these days, eh?"\r\n\r\n"I had not the least idea I was pensive," said the young man.\r\n\r\n"You are very much preoccupied; you are thinking of something."\r\n\r\n"And what is it," he asked, "that you accuse me of thinking of?"\r\n\r\n"Of that young lady\'s--Miss Baker\'s, Miss Chandler\'s--what\'s her\r\nname?--Miss Miller\'s intrigue with that little barber\'s block."\r\n\r\n"Do you call it an intrigue," Winterbourne asked--"an affair that goes\r\non with such peculiar publicity?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s their folly," said Mrs. Costello; "it\'s not their merit."\r\n\r\n"No," rejoined Winterbourne, with something of that pensiveness to which\r\nhis aunt had alluded. "I don\'t believe that there is anything to be\r\ncalled an intrigue."\r\n\r\n"I have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried\r\naway by him."\r\n\r\n"They are certainly very intimate," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\nMrs. Costello inspected the young couple again with her optical\r\ninstrument. "He is very handsome. One easily sees how it is. She thinks\r\nhim the most elegant man in the world, the finest gentleman. She has\r\nnever seen anything like him; he is better, even, than the courier.\r\nIt was the courier probably who introduced him; and if he succeeds in\r\nmarrying the young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent\r\ncommission."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe she thinks of marrying him," said Winterbourne, "and I\r\ndon\'t believe he hopes to marry her."\r\n\r\n"You may be very sure she thinks of nothing. She goes on from day to\r\nday, from hour to hour, as they did in the Golden Age. I can imagine\r\nnothing more vulgar. And at the same time," added Mrs. Costello, "depend\r\nupon it that she may tell you any moment that she is \'engaged.\'"\r\n\r\n"I think that is more than Giovanelli expects," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Who is Giovanelli?"\r\n\r\n"The little Italian. I have asked questions about him and learned\r\nsomething. He is apparently a perfectly respectable little man. I\r\nbelieve he is, in a small way, a cavaliere avvocato. But he doesn\'t\r\nmove in what are called the first circles. I think it is really not\r\nabsolutely impossible that the courier introduced him. He is evidently\r\nimmensely charmed with Miss Miller. If she thinks him the finest\r\ngentleman in the world, he, on his side, has never found himself in\r\npersonal contact with such splendor, such opulence, such expensiveness\r\nas this young lady\'s. And then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty\r\nand interesting. I rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her. That\r\nmust appear to him too impossible a piece of luck. He has nothing but\r\nhis handsome face to offer, and there is a substantial Mr. Miller in\r\nthat mysterious land of dollars. Giovanelli knows that he hasn\'t a title\r\nto offer. If he were only a count or a marchese! He must wonder at his\r\nluck, at the way they have taken him up."\r\n\r\n"He accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks Miss Miller a young\r\nlady qui se passe ses fantaisies!" said Mrs. Costello.\r\n\r\n"It is very true," Winterbourne pursued, "that Daisy and her mamma have\r\nnot yet risen to that stage of--what shall I call it?--of culture at\r\nwhich the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins. I believe that\r\nthey are intellectually incapable of that conception."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but the avvocato can\'t believe it," said Mrs. Costello.\r\n\r\nOf the observation excited by Daisy\'s "intrigue," Winterbourne gathered\r\nthat day at St. Peter\'s sufficient evidence. A dozen of the American\r\ncolonists in Rome came to talk with Mrs. Costello, who sat on a little\r\nportable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters. The vesper\r\nservice was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the\r\nadjacent choir, and meanwhile, between Mrs. Costello and her friends,\r\nthere was a great deal said about poor little Miss Miller\'s going really\r\n"too far." Winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard, but when,\r\ncoming out upon the great steps of the church, he saw Daisy, who had\r\nemerged before him, get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll\r\naway through the cynical streets of Rome, he could not deny to himself\r\nthat she was going very far indeed. He felt very sorry for her--not\r\nexactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head, but\r\nbecause it was painful to hear so much that was pretty, and undefended,\r\nand natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder.\r\nHe made an attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs. Miller. He met one\r\nday in the Corso a friend, a tourist like himself, who had just come\r\nout of the Doria Palace, where he had been walking through the beautiful\r\ngallery. His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait\r\nof Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the\r\npalace, and then said, "And in the same cabinet, by the way, I had the\r\npleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind--that pretty\r\nAmerican girl whom you pointed out to me last week." In answer to\r\nWinterbourne\'s inquiries, his friend narrated that the pretty American\r\ngirl--prettier than ever--was seated with a companion in the secluded\r\nnook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined.\r\n\r\n"Who was her companion?" asked Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole. The girl is\r\ndelightfully pretty, but I thought I understood from you the other day\r\nthat she was a young lady du meilleur monde."\r\n\r\n"So she is!" answered Winterbourne; and having assured himself that his\r\ninformant had seen Daisy and her companion but five minutes before, he\r\njumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs. Miller. She was at home; but\r\nshe apologized to him for receiving him in Daisy\'s absence.\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone out somewhere with Mr. Giovanelli," said Mrs. Miller. "She\'s\r\nalways going round with Mr. Giovanelli."\r\n\r\n"I have noticed that they are very intimate," Winterbourne observed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it seems as if they couldn\'t live without each other!" said Mrs.\r\nMiller. "Well, he\'s a real gentleman, anyhow. I keep telling Daisy she\'s\r\nengaged!"\r\n\r\n"And what does Daisy say?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she says she isn\'t engaged. But she might as well be!" this\r\nimpartial parent resumed; "she goes on as if she was. But I\'ve made Mr.\r\nGiovanelli promise to tell me, if SHE doesn\'t. I should want to write to\r\nMr. Miller about it--shouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne replied that he certainly should; and the state of mind of\r\nDaisy\'s mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental\r\nvigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her\r\nupon her guard.\r\n\r\nAfter this Daisy was never at home, and Winterbourne ceased to meet her\r\nat the houses of their common acquaintances, because, as he perceived,\r\nthese shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too\r\nfar. They ceased to invite her; and they intimated that they desired to\r\nexpress to observant Europeans the great truth that, though Miss\r\nDaisy Miller was a young American lady, her behavior was not\r\nrepresentative--was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal.\r\nWinterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that\r\nwere turned toward her, and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that\r\nshe did not feel at all. He said to himself that she was too light and\r\nchildish, too uncultivated and unreasoning, too provincial, to have\r\nreflected upon her ostracism, or even to have perceived it. Then at\r\nother moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and\r\nirresponsible little organism a defiant, passionate, perfectly observant\r\nconsciousness of the impression she produced. He asked himself whether\r\nDaisy\'s defiance came from the consciousness of innocence, or from her\r\nbeing, essentially, a young person of the reckless class. It must be\r\nadmitted that holding one\'s self to a belief in Daisy\'s "innocence" came\r\nto seem to Winterbourne more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry.\r\nAs I have already had occasion to relate, he was angry at finding\r\nhimself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady; he was vexed at\r\nhis want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were\r\ngeneric, national, and how far they were personal. From either view\r\nof them he had somehow missed her, and now it was too late. She was\r\n"carried away" by Mr. Giovanelli.\r\n\r\nA few days after his brief interview with her mother, he encountered her\r\nin that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of\r\nthe Caesars. The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and\r\nperfume, and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender\r\nverdure. Daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds\r\nof ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental\r\ninscriptions. It seemed to him that Rome had never been so lovely as\r\njust then. He stood, looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and\r\ncolor that remotely encircles the city, inhaling the softly humid odors,\r\nand feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place\r\nreaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion. It seemed to him also\r\nthat Daisy had never looked so pretty, but this had been an observation\r\nof his whenever he met her. Giovanelli was at her side, and Giovanelli,\r\ntoo, wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Daisy, "I should think you would be lonesome!"\r\n\r\n"Lonesome?" asked Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"You are always going round by yourself. Can\'t you get anyone to walk\r\nwith you?"\r\n\r\n"I am not so fortunate," said Winterbourne, "as your companion."\r\n\r\nGiovanelli, from the first, had treated Winterbourne with distinguished\r\npoliteness. He listened with a deferential air to his remarks; he\r\nlaughed punctiliously at his pleasantries; he seemed disposed to testify\r\nto his belief that Winterbourne was a superior young man. He carried\r\nhimself in no degree like a jealous wooer; he had obviously a great deal\r\nof tact; he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him.\r\nIt even seemed to Winterbourne at times that Giovanelli would find a\r\ncertain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with\r\nhim--to say to him, as an intelligent man, that, bless you, HE knew\r\nhow extraordinary was this young lady, and didn\'t flatter himself with\r\ndelusive--or at least TOO delusive--hopes of matrimony and dollars. On\r\nthis occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of\r\nalmond blossom, which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole.\r\n\r\n"I know why you say that," said Daisy, watching Giovanelli. "Because you\r\nthink I go round too much with HIM." And she nodded at her attendant.\r\n\r\n"Every one thinks so--if you care to know," said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\n"Of course I care to know!" Daisy exclaimed seriously. "But I don\'t\r\nbelieve it. They are only pretending to be shocked. They don\'t really\r\ncare a straw what I do. Besides, I don\'t go round so much."\r\n\r\n"I think you will find they do care. They will show it disagreeably."\r\n\r\nDaisy looked at him a moment. "How disagreeably?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you noticed anything?" Winterbourne asked.\r\n\r\n"I have noticed you. But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the\r\nfirst time I saw you."\r\n\r\n"You will find I am not so stiff as several others," said Winterbourne,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"How shall I find it?"\r\n\r\n"By going to see the others."\r\n\r\n"What will they do to me?"\r\n\r\n"They will give you the cold shoulder. Do you know what that means?"\r\n\r\nDaisy was looking at him intently; she began to color. "Do you mean as\r\nMrs. Walker did the other night?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" said Winterbourne.\r\n\r\nShe looked away at Giovanelli, who was decorating himself with his\r\nalmond blossom. Then looking back at Winterbourne, "I shouldn\'t think\r\nyou would let people be so unkind!" she said.\r\n\r\n"How can I help it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I should think you would say something."\r\n\r\n"I do say something;" and he paused a moment. "I say that your mother\r\ntells me that she believes you are engaged."\r\n\r\n"Well, she does," said Daisy very simply.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne began to laugh. "And does Randolph believe it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I guess Randolph doesn\'t believe anything," said Daisy. Randolph\'s\r\nskepticism excited Winterbourne to further hilarity, and he observed\r\nthat Giovanelli was coming back to them. Daisy, observing it too,\r\naddressed herself again to her countryman. "Since you have mentioned\r\nit," she said, "I AM engaged." * * * Winterbourne looked at her; he had\r\nstopped laughing. "You don\'t believe!" she added.\r\n\r\nHe was silent a moment; and then, "Yes, I believe it," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you don\'t!" she answered. "Well, then--I am not!"\r\n\r\nThe young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the\r\nenclosure, so that Winterbourne, who had but lately entered, presently\r\ntook leave of them. A week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful\r\nvilla on the Caelian Hill, and, on arriving, dismissed his hired\r\nvehicle. The evening was charming, and he promised himself the\r\nsatisfaction of walking home beneath the Arch of Constantine and past\r\nthe vaguely lighted monuments of the Forum. There was a waning moon in\r\nthe sky, and her radiance was not brilliant, but she was veiled in a\r\nthin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it. When, on his\r\nreturn from the villa (it was eleven o\'clock), Winterbourne approached\r\nthe dusky circle of the Colosseum, it recurred to him, as a lover of\r\nthe picturesque, that the interior, in the pale moonshine, would be well\r\nworth a glance. He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches,\r\nnear which, as he observed, an open carriage--one of the little Roman\r\nstreetcabs--was stationed. Then he passed in, among the cavernous\r\nshadows of the great structure, and emerged upon the clear and silent\r\narena. The place had never seemed to him more impressive. One-half of\r\nthe gigantic circus was in deep shade, the other was sleeping in the\r\nluminous dusk. As he stood there he began to murmur Byron\'s famous\r\nlines, out of "Manfred," but before he had finished his quotation\r\nhe remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the Colosseum are\r\nrecommended by the poets, they are deprecated by the doctors. The\r\nhistoric atmosphere was there, certainly; but the historic atmosphere,\r\nscientifically considered, was no better than a villainous miasma.\r\nWinterbourne walked to the middle of the arena, to take a more general\r\nglance, intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat. The great cross in\r\nthe center was covered with shadow; it was only as he drew near it that\r\nhe made it out distinctly. Then he saw that two persons were stationed\r\nupon the low steps which formed its base. One of these was a woman,\r\nseated; her companion was standing in front of her.\r\n\r\nPresently the sound of the woman\'s voice came to him distinctly in the\r\nwarm night air. "Well, he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers\r\nmay have looked at the Christian martyrs!" These were the words he\r\nheard, in the familiar accent of Miss Daisy Miller.\r\n\r\n"Let us hope he is not very hungry," responded the ingenious Giovanelli.\r\n"He will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with\r\na sort of relief. It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed\r\nupon the ambiguity of Daisy\'s behavior, and the riddle had become easy\r\nto read. She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be\r\nat pains to respect. He stood there, looking at her--looking at her\r\ncompanion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself\r\nmust have been more brightly visible. He felt angry with himself that he\r\nhad bothered so much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller.\r\nThen, as he was going to advance again, he checked himself, not from the\r\nfear that he was doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger\r\nof appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from\r\ncautious criticism. He turned away toward the entrance of the place,\r\nbut, as he did so, he heard Daisy speak again.\r\n\r\n"Why, it was Mr. Winterbourne! He saw me, and he cuts me!"\r\n\r\nWhat a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at\r\ninjured innocence! But he wouldn\'t cut her. Winterbourne came forward\r\nagain and went toward the great cross. Daisy had got up; Giovanelli\r\nlifted his hat. Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the\r\ncraziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl\r\nlounging away the evening in this nest of malaria. What if she WERE\r\na clever little reprobate? that was no reason for her dying of the\r\nperniciosa. "How long have you been here?" he asked almost brutally.\r\n\r\nDaisy, lovely in the flattering moonlight, looked at him a moment.\r\nThen--"All the evening," she answered, gently. * * * "I never saw\r\nanything so pretty."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," said Winterbourne, "that you will not think Roman fever\r\nvery pretty. This is the way people catch it. I wonder," he added,\r\nturning to Giovanelli, "that you, a native Roman, should countenance\r\nsuch a terrible indiscretion."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the handsome native, "for myself I am not afraid."\r\n\r\n"Neither am I--for you! I am speaking for this young lady."\r\n\r\nGiovanelli lifted his well-shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant\r\nteeth. But he took Winterbourne\'s rebuke with docility. "I told the\r\nsignorina it was a grave indiscretion, but when was the signorina ever\r\nprudent?"\r\n\r\n"I never was sick, and I don\'t mean to be!" the signorina declared. "I\r\ndon\'t look like much, but I\'m healthy! I was bound to see the Colosseum\r\nby moonlight; I shouldn\'t have wanted to go home without that; and we\r\nhave had the most beautiful time, haven\'t we, Mr. Giovanelli? If there\r\nhas been any danger, Eugenio can give me some pills. He has got some\r\nsplendid pills."\r\n\r\n"I should advise you," said Winterbourne, "to drive home as fast as\r\npossible and take one!"\r\n\r\n"What you say is very wise," Giovanelli rejoined. "I will go and make\r\nsure the carriage is at hand." And he went forward rapidly.\r\n\r\nDaisy followed with Winterbourne. He kept looking at her; she seemed\r\nnot in the least embarrassed. Winterbourne said nothing; Daisy chattered\r\nabout the beauty of the place. "Well, I HAVE seen the Colosseum by\r\nmoonlight!" she exclaimed. "That\'s one good thing." Then, noticing\r\nWinterbourne\'s silence, she asked him why he didn\'t speak. He made\r\nno answer; he only began to laugh. They passed under one of the dark\r\narchways; Giovanelli was in front with the carriage. Here Daisy stopped\r\na moment, looking at the young American. "DID you believe I was engaged,\r\nthe other day?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter what I believed the other day," said Winterbourne,\r\nstill laughing.\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you believe now?"\r\n\r\n"I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged\r\nor not!"\r\n\r\nHe felt the young girl\'s pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick\r\ngloom of the archway; she was apparently going to answer. But Giovanelli\r\nhurried her forward. "Quick! quick!" he said; "if we get in by midnight\r\nwe are quite safe."\r\n\r\nDaisy took her seat in the carriage, and the fortunate Italian placed\r\nhimself beside her. "Don\'t forget Eugenio\'s pills!" said Winterbourne as\r\nhe lifted his hat.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Daisy in a little strange tone, "whether I have\r\nRoman fever or not!" Upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they\r\nrolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne, to do him justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that\r\nhe had encountered Miss Miller, at midnight, in the Colosseum with a\r\ngentleman; but nevertheless, a couple of days later, the fact of her\r\nhaving been there under these circumstances was known to every member\r\nof the little American circle, and commented accordingly. Winterbourne\r\nreflected that they had of course known it at the hotel, and that, after\r\nDaisy\'s return, there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter\r\nand the cab driver. But the young man was conscious, at the same moment,\r\nthat it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the\r\nlittle American flirt should be "talked about" by low-minded menials.\r\nThese people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the\r\nlittle American flirt was alarmingly ill. Winterbourne, when the rumor\r\ncame to him, immediately went to the hotel for more news. He found that\r\ntwo or three charitable friends had preceded him, and that they were\r\nbeing entertained in Mrs. Miller\'s salon by Randolph.\r\n\r\n"It\'s going round at night," said Randolph--"that\'s what made her sick.\r\nShe\'s always going round at night. I shouldn\'t think she\'d want to,\r\nit\'s so plaguy dark. You can\'t see anything here at night, except when\r\nthere\'s a moon. In America there\'s always a moon!" Mrs. Miller was\r\ninvisible; she was now, at least, giving her daughter the advantage of\r\nher society. It was evident that Daisy was dangerously ill.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne went often to ask for news of her, and once he saw Mrs.\r\nMiller, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his surprise,\r\nperfectly composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious\r\nnurse. She talked a good deal about Dr. Davis, but Winterbourne paid her\r\nthe compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such\r\na monstrous goose. "Daisy spoke of you the other day," she said to him.\r\n"Half the time she doesn\'t know what she\'s saying, but that time I think\r\nshe did. She gave me a message she told me to tell you. She told me to\r\ntell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian. I am sure\r\nI am very glad; Mr. Giovanelli hasn\'t been near us since she was taken\r\nill. I thought he was so much of a gentleman; but I don\'t call that\r\nvery polite! A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for\r\ntaking Daisy round at night. Well, so I am, but I suppose he knows I\'m a\r\nlady. I would scorn to scold him. Anyway, she says she\'s not engaged. I\r\ndon\'t know why she wanted you to know, but she said to me three times,\r\n\'Mind you tell Mr. Winterbourne.\' And then she told me to ask if you\r\nremembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland. But I said\r\nI wouldn\'t give any such messages as that. Only, if she is not engaged,\r\nI\'m sure I\'m glad to know it."\r\n\r\nBut, as Winterbourne had said, it mattered very little. A week after\r\nthis, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever.\r\nDaisy\'s grave was in the little Protestant cemetery, in an angle of\r\nthe wall of imperial Rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring\r\nflowers. Winterbourne stood there beside it, with a number of other\r\nmourners, a number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady\'s\r\ncareer would have led you to expect. Near him stood Giovanelli, who came\r\nnearer still before Winterbourne turned away. Giovanelli was very pale:\r\non this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole; he seemed to wish\r\nto say something. At last he said, "She was the most beautiful young\r\nlady I ever saw, and the most amiable;" and then he added in a moment,\r\n"and she was the most innocent."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words, "And the\r\nmost innocent?"\r\n\r\n"The most innocent!"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne felt sore and angry. "Why the devil," he asked, "did you\r\ntake her to that fatal place?"\r\n\r\nMr. Giovanelli\'s urbanity was apparently imperturbable. He looked on the\r\nground a moment, and then he said, "For myself I had no fear; and she\r\nwanted to go."\r\n\r\n"That was no reason!" Winterbourne declared.\r\n\r\nThe subtle Roman again dropped his eyes. "If she had lived, I should\r\nhave got nothing. She would never have married me, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"She would never have married you?"\r\n\r\n"For a moment I hoped so. But no. I am sure."\r\n\r\nWinterbourne listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance\r\namong the April daisies. When he turned away again, Mr. Giovanelli, with\r\nhis light, slow step, had retired.\r\n\r\nWinterbourne almost immediately left Rome; but the following summer he\r\nagain met his aunt, Mrs. Costello at Vevey. Mrs. Costello was fond of\r\nVevey. In the interval Winterbourne had often thought of Daisy Miller\r\nand her mystifying manners. One day he spoke of her to his aunt--said it\r\nwas on his conscience that he had done her injustice.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know," said Mrs. Costello. "How did your injustice\r\naffect her?"\r\n\r\n"She sent me a message before her death which I didn\'t understand at the\r\ntime; but I have understood it since. She would have appreciated one\'s\r\nesteem."\r\n\r\n"Is that a modest way," asked Mrs. Costello, "of saying that she would\r\nhave reciprocated one\'s affection?"\r\n\r\nWinterbourne offered no answer to this question; but he presently said,\r\n"You were right in that remark that you made last summer. I was booked\r\nto make a mistake. I have lived too long in foreign parts."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he went back to live at Geneva, whence there continue to\r\ncome the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn: a report\r\nthat he is "studying" hard--an intimation that he is much interested in\r\na very clever foreign lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Daisy Miller, by Henry James\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DAISY MILLER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 208.txt or 208.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/208/\r\n\r\nProduced by Judith Boss\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
