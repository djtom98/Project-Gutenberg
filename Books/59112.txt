They are high-powered laborers, good for nothing\r\nbut work. There are two grades, the unskilled and the skilled, and\r\nespecially trained workmen are furnished on request.\r\n\r\nWhen Helena Glory, president of the Humanitarian League, comes\r\nto ascertain what can be done to improve the condition of those\r\noverspecialized creatures, Harry Domin, the general manager of the\r\nfactory, captures her heart and hand in the speediest courting on\r\nrecord in our theatre. The last two acts take place ten years later.\r\nDue to the desire of Helena to have the Robots more like human beings,\r\nDr. Gall, the head of the physiological and experimental departments,\r\nhas secretly changed the formula, and while he has partially humanized\r\nonly a few hundreds, there are enough to make ringleaders, and a world\r\nrevolt of robots is under way. This revolution is easily accomplished,\r\nas robots have long since been used when needed as soldiers and the\r\nrobots far outnumber human beings.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the play is magnificent melodrama, superbly portrayed,\r\nwith the handful of human beings at bay while the unseen myriads of\r\ntheir own robots close in on them. The final scene is like Dunsany on a\r\nmammoth scale.\r\n\r\nThen comes the epilogue, in which Alquist, the company\xe2\x80\x99s builder, is\r\nnot only the only human being on the island, but also the only one\r\nleft on earth. The robots have destroyed the rest of mankind. They\r\nspared his life because he was a worker. And he is spending his days\r\nunceasingly endeavoring to discover and reconstruct the lost formula.\r\nThe robots are doomed. They saved the wrong man. They should have\r\nspared the company\xe2\x80\x99s physicist. The robots know that their bodies\r\nwill wear out in time and there will be no new multitudes of robots\r\nto replace them. But Alquist discovers two humanized robots, a young\r\nman and young woman, who have a bit of Adam and Eve in them, and the\r\naudience perceives that mankind is about to start afresh. Nature has\r\nwon out, after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cast of the Theatre Guild Production as originally presented at the\r\nGarrick Theatre, New York:\r\n\r\nR. U.

There\xe2\x80\x99s a lady, sir, asking to see you.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. A lady? Who is she?\r\n\r\nMARIUS. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir. She brings this card of introduction.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Reading card_) Ah, from President Glory. Ask her to come in--\r\n(_To SULLA. Crossing up to her desk, then back to his own_) Where did I\r\nleave off?\r\n\r\nSULLA. \xe2\x80\x9cWe beg to acknowledge receipt of order for fifteen thousand\r\nRobots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Fifteen thousand. Fifteen thousand.\r\n\r\nMARIUS. (_At door R._) Please step this way.\r\n\r\n  (_Enter HELENA. Exit MARIUS R._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Crossing to desk_) How do you do?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. How do you do? What can I do for you?\r\n\r\nHELENA. You are Mr. Domin, the General Manager?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I am.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I have come--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. With President Glory\xe2\x80\x99s card. That is quite sufficient.\r\n\r\nHELENA. President Glory is my father. I am Helena Glory.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Please sit down. Sulla, you may go. (_Exit SULLA L. Sitting down\r\nL. of desk_) How can I be of service to you, Miss Glory?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I have come-- (_Sits R. of desk._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. To have a look at our famous works where people are\r\nmanufactured. Like all visitors. Well, there is no objection.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I thought it was forbidden to--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. To enter the factory? Yes, of course. Everybody comes here with\r\nsomeone\xe2\x80\x99s visiting card, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And you show them--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Only certain things. The manufacture of artificial people is a\r\nsecret process.\r\n\r\nHELENA. If you only knew how enormously that--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Interests you. Europe\xe2\x80\x99s talking about nothing else.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Indignantly turning front_) Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you let me finish\r\nspeaking?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Drier_) I beg your pardon. Did you want to say something\r\ndifferent?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I only wanted to ask--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Whether I could make a special exception in your case and show\r\nyou our factory. Why, certainly, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. How do you know I wanted to say that?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. They all do. But we shall consider it a special honor to show\r\nyou more than we do the rest.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Thank you.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Standing_) But you must agree not to divulge the least--\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Standing and giving him her hand_) My word of honor.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Thank you. (_Looking at her hand_) Won\xe2\x80\x99t you raise your veil?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Of course. You want to see whether I\xe2\x80\x99m a spy or not--I beg your\r\npardon.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Leaning forward_) What is it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Would you mind releasing my hand?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Releasing it_) Oh, I beg _your_ pardon.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Raising veil_) How cautious you have to be here, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Observing her with deep interest_) Why, yes. Hm--of\r\ncourse--We--that is--\r\n\r\nHELENA. But what is it? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I\xe2\x80\x99m remarkably pleased. Did you have a pleasant crossing?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. No difficulty?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What I mean to say is--you\xe2\x80\x99re so _young_.\r\n\r\nHELENA. May we go straight into the factory?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes. Twenty-two, I think.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Twenty-two what?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Years.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Twenty-one. Why do you want to know?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Well, because--as-- (_Sits on desk nearer her_) You will make a\r\nlong stay, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Backing away R._) That depends on how much of the factory you\r\nshow me.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Rises; crosses to her_) Oh, hang the factory. Oh, no, no, you\r\nshall see everything, Miss Glory. Indeed you shall. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down?\r\n(_Takes her to couch R.C. She sits. Offers her cigarette from case at\r\nend of sofa. She refuses._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Thank you.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. But first would you like to hear the story of the invention?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes, indeed.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Crosses to L.C. near desk_) It was in the year 1920 that old\r\nRossum, the great physiologist, who was then quite a young scientist,\r\ntook himself to the distant island for the purpose of studying the\r\nocean fauna. (_She is amused._) On this occasion he attempted by\r\nchemical synthesis to imitate the living matter known as protoplasm\r\nuntil he suddenly discovered a substance which behaved exactly like\r\nliving matter although its chemical composition was different. That\r\nwas in the year 1932, exactly four hundred and forty years after the\r\ndiscovery of America. Whew--\r\n\r\nHELENA. Do you know that by heart?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Takes flowers from desk to her_) Yes. You see, physiology is\r\nnot in my line. Shall I go on?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Smelling flowers_) Yes, please.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Center_) And then, Miss Glory, Old Rossum wrote the following\r\namong his chemical experiments: \xe2\x80\x9cNature has found only one method\r\nof organizing living matter. There is, however, another method, more\r\nsimple, flexible and rapid which has not yet occurred to Nature at all.\r\nThis second process by which life can be developed was discovered by me\r\ntoday.\xe2\x80\x9d Now imagine him, Miss Glory, writing those wonderful words over\r\nsome colloidal mess that a dog wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at. Imagine him sitting\r\nover a test tube and thinking how the whole tree of life would grow\r\nfrom him, how all animals would proceed from it, beginning with some\r\nsort of a beetle and ending with a _man_. A man of different substance\r\nfrom us. Miss Glory, that was a tremendous moment. (_Gets box of candy\r\nfrom desk and passes it to her._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Well--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_As she speaks his portable PHONE lights up and he answers_)\r\nWell--Hello!--Yes--no, I\xe2\x80\x99m in conference. Don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb me.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Well?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Smile_) Now, the thing was how to get the life _out_ of the\r\ntest tubes, and hasten development and form organs, bones and nerves,\r\nand so on, and find such substances as catalytics, enzymes, hormones in\r\nshort--you understand?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Not much, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Never mind. (_Leans over couch and fixes cushion for her back_)\r\nThere! You see with the help of his tinctures he could make whatever\r\nhe wanted. He could have produced a Medusa with the brain of Socrates\r\nor a worm fifty yards long-- (_She laughs. He does also; leans closer\r\non couch, then straightens up again_) --but being without a grain of\r\nhumor, he took into his head to make a vertebrate or perhaps a man.\r\nThis artificial living _matter_ of his had a raging thirst for life. It\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being sown or mixed together. That couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done with\r\nnatural albumen. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how he set about it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. About what?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. About imitating Nature. First of all he tried making an\r\nartificial dog. That took him several years and resulted in a sort of\r\nstunted calf which _died_ in a few days. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show it to you in the\r\nmuseum. And _then_ old Rossum started on the manufacture of _man_.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And I\xe2\x80\x99m to divulge this to nobody?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. To nobody in the world.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What a pity that it\xe2\x80\x99s to be discovered in _all_ the school\r\nbooks of both Europe and America. (_BOTH laugh._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes. But do you know what _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ in the school books? That old\r\nRossum was mad. Seriously, Miss Glory, you must keep this to yourself.\r\nThe old crank wanted to actually make _people_.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But you do make people.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. _Approximately_--Miss Glory. But old Rossum meant it literally.\r\nHe wanted to become a sort of scientific substitute for _God_. He was a\r\nfearful materialist, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he did it all. His sole purpose was\r\nnothing more or less than to prove that God was no longer necessary.\r\n(_Crosses to end of couch_) Do you know anything about anatomy?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Very little.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Neither do I. Well-- (_He laughs_) --he then decided to\r\nmanufacture everything as in the human body. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you in the\r\nmuseum the bungling attempt it took him ten years to produce. It was\r\nto have been a _man_, but it lived for three days only. Then up came\r\n_young_ Rossum, an engineer. He was a wonderful fellow, Miss Glory.\r\nWhen he saw what a mess of it the old man was making he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsurd to spend ten years making a man. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t make him quicker\r\nthan Nature, you might as well shut up shop.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he set about\r\nlearning anatomy himself.\r\n\r\nHELENA. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing about _that_ in the school books?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. No. The school books are full of paid advertisements, and\r\nrubbish at that. What the school books say about the _united efforts_\r\nof the two great Rossums is all a fairy tale. They used to have\r\ndreadful rows. The old _atheist_ hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the slightest conception of\r\nindustrial _matters_, and the end of it was that Young Rossum shut him\r\nup in some laboratory or other and let him fritter the time away with\r\nhis monstrosities while he himself started on the business from an\r\n_engineer\xe2\x80\x99s_ point of view. Old Rossum _cursed_ him and before he died\r\nhe managed to botch up two physiological horrors. Then one day they\r\nfound him dead in the _laboratory_. And that\xe2\x80\x99s his whole story.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And what about the young man?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Sits beside her on couch_) Well, anyone who has looked into\r\nhuman anatomy will have seen at once that man is too complicated, and\r\nthat a good engineer could make him more simply. So young Rossum began\r\nto _overhaul_ anatomy to see what could be left out or simplified. In\r\nshort--But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t boring you, Miss Glory?\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, indeed. You\xe2\x80\x99re--It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully interesting.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Gets closer_) So young Rossum said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cA man is\r\nsomething that feels happy, plays the piano, likes going for a walk,\r\nand, in fact, wants to do a whole lot of things that are really\r\nunnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. That are unnecessary when he wants-- (_Takes her hand_) --let us\r\nsay, to weave or count. Do you play the piano?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. That\xe2\x80\x99s good. (_Kisses her hand. She lowers her head._) Oh, I\r\nbeg your pardon! (_Rises_) But a working machine must _not_ play the\r\npiano, must not feel happy, must not do a whole lot of other things.\r\nA gasoline motor must not have tassels or ornaments, Miss Glory. And\r\nto manufacture artificial workers is the same thing as the manufacture\r\nof a gasoline motor. (_She is not interested._) The process must be\r\nthe simplest, and the product the best from a practical point of view.\r\n(_Sits beside her again_) What sort of worker do you think is the\r\n_best_ from a practical point of view?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Absently_) What? (_Looks at him._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What sort of worker do you think is the best from a practical\r\npoint of view?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Pulling herself together_) Oh! Perhaps the one who is most\r\nhonest and hard-working.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. No. The one that is the _cheapest_. The one whose requirements\r\nare the _smallest_. Young Rossum invented a worker with the minimum\r\namount of requirements. He had to simplify him. He rejected everything\r\nthat did not contribute directly to the progress of work. Everything\r\nthat makes man more expensive. In fact he _rejected man_ and made the\r\n_Robot_. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not people. Mechanically\r\nthey are more _perfect_ than we are; they have an enormously developed\r\nintelligence, but they have no soul. (_Leans back._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. How do you know they have no soul?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Have you ever seen what a Robot looks like inside?\r\n\r\nHELENA. No.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Very neat, very simple. Really a beautiful piece of work.\r\nNot much _in_ it, but everything in flawless order. The product of\r\nan engineer _is_ technically at a higher pitch of perfection than a\r\nproduct of Nature.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But man is supposed to be the product of God.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. All the worse. God hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the slightest notion of modern\r\nengineering. Would you believe that young Rossum then proceeded to play\r\nat being God?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Awed_) How do you mean?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. He began to manufacture Super-Robots. Regular giants they were.\r\nHe tried to make them twelve feet tall. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what\r\na failure they were.\r\n\r\nHELENA. A failure?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes. For no reason at all their limbs used to keep snapping off.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently our planet is too small for giants.\xe2\x80\x9d Now we only make Robots\r\nof normal size and of very high-class human finish.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Hands him flower; he puts it in button-hole_) I saw the first\r\nRobots at home. The Town Council bought them for--I mean engaged them\r\nfor work.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. No. _Bought_ them, Miss Glory. Robots are bought and sold.\r\n\r\nHELENA. These were employed as street-sweepers. I saw them sweeping.\r\nThey were so strange and quiet.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Rises_) Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s Universal Robot factory doesn\xe2\x80\x99t produce\r\na uniform brand of Robots. We have Robots of _finer_ and _coarser_\r\ngrades. The best will live about _twenty_ years. (_Crosses to desk.\r\nHELENA looks in her pocket mirror. He pushes button on desk._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Then they die?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes, they get used up. (_Enter MARIUS, R. DOMIN crosses to\r\nC._) Marius, bring in samples of the manual labor Robot. (_Exit\r\nMARIUS R.C._) I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you specimens of the two extremes. This first\r\ngrade is comparatively inexpensive and is made in vast quantities.\r\n(_MARIUS re-enters R.C. with two manual labor ROBOTS. MARIUS is L.C.,\r\nROBOTS R.C., DOMIN at desk. MARIUS stands on tiptoes, touches head,\r\nfeels arms, forehead of one of the ROBOTS. They come to a mechanical\r\nstandstill._) There you are, as powerful as a small tractor. Guaranteed\r\nto have average intelligence. That will do, Marius. (_MARIUS exits R.C.\r\nwith ROBOTS._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. They make me feel so strange.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Crosses to desk. Rings_) Did you see my new typist?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice her.\r\n\r\n  (_Enter SULLA L. She crosses and stands C., facing HELENA, who is\r\n  still sitting in the couch._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Sulla, let Miss Glory see you.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Looks at DOMIN. Rising, crosses a step to C._) So pleased to\r\nmeet you. (_Looks at DOMIN_) You must find it terribly dull in this out\r\nof the way spot, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nSULLA. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Where do you come from?\r\n\r\nSULLA. From the factory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, were you born there?\r\n\r\nSULLA. I was _made_ there.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What? (_Looks first at SULLA, then at DOMIN._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_To SULLA, laughing_) Sulla is a Robot, best grade.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, I beg your pardon.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Crosses to SULLA_) Sulla isn\xe2\x80\x99t angry. See, Miss Glory, the\r\nkind of skin we make. Feel her face. (_Touches SULLA\xe2\x80\x99S face._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, no, no.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Examining SULLA\xe2\x80\x99S hand_) You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know that she\xe2\x80\x99s made of\r\ndifferent material from us, would you? Turn \xe2\x80\x99round, Sulla. (_SULLA does\r\nso. Circles twice._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, stop, stop.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Talk to Miss Glory, Sulla. (_Examines hair of SULLA._)\r\n\r\nSULLA. Please sit down. (_HELENA sits on couch._) Did you have a\r\npleasant crossing? (_Fixes her hair._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, yes, certainly.\r\n\r\nSULLA. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go back on the _Amelia_, Miss Glory, the barometer is\r\nfalling steadily. Wait for the _Pennsylvania_. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good powerful\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What\xe2\x80\x99s its speed?\r\n\r\nSULLA. Forty knots an hour. Fifty thousand tons. One of the latest\r\nvessels, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSULLA. A crew of fifteen hundred, Captain Harpy, eight boilers--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. That\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Sulla. Now show us your knowledge of French.\r\n\r\nHELENA. You know French?\r\n\r\nSULLA. Oui! Madame! I know four languages. I can write: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Sir,\r\nMonsieur, Geehrter Herr, Cteny pane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Jumping up, crosses to SULLA_) Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s absurd! Sulla isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na Robot. Sulla is a girl like me. Sulla, this is outrageous--Why do you\r\ntake part in such a hoax?\r\n\r\nSULLA. I am a Robot.\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, no, you are not telling the truth. (_She catches the amused\r\nexpression on DOMIN\xe2\x80\x99S face_) I know they have forced you to do it for\r\nan advertisement. Sulla, you are a girl like me, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? (_Looks at\r\nhim._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Miss Glory. _Sulla is a Robot._\r\n\r\nHELENA. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lie!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What? (_Pushes button on desk_) Well, then I must _convince_\r\nyou. (_Enter MARIUS R.C. He stands just inside the door._) Marius, take\r\nSulla into the dissecting room, and tell them to open her up at once.\r\n(_MARIUS moves toward C._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Where?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Into the dissecting room. When they\xe2\x80\x99ve _cut her open_, you can\r\ngo and have a look. (_MARIUS makes a start toward SULLA._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Stopping MARIUS_) No! No!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Excuse me, you spoke of lies.\r\n\r\nHELENA. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have her killed?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. You can\xe2\x80\x99t kill machines. Sulla! (_MARIUS one step forward, one\r\narm out. SULLA makes a move toward R. door._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Moves a step R._) Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, Sulla. I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go.\r\nTell me, my dear-- (_Takes her hand_) --are they always so cruel to\r\nyou? You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t put up with it, Sulla. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nSULLA. I am a Robot.\r\n\r\nHELENA. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Robots are just as good as we are. Sulla,\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let yourself be cut to pieces?\r\n\r\nSULLA. Yes. (_Hand away._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid of death, then?\r\n\r\nSULLA. I cannot tell, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Do you know what would happen to you in there?\r\n\r\nSULLA. Yes, I should cease to move.\r\n\r\nHELENA. How dreadful! (_Looks at SULLA._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Marius, tell Miss Glory what you are? (_Turns to HELENA._)\r\n\r\nMARIUS. (_To HELENA_) Marius, the Robot.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Would you take Sulla into the dissecting room?\r\n\r\nMARIUS. (_Turns to DOMIN_) Yes.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Would you be sorry for her?\r\n\r\nMARIUS. (_Pause_) I cannot tell.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What would happen to her?\r\n\r\nMARIUS. She would cease to move. They would put her into the stamping\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. That is death, Marius. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid of death?\r\n\r\nMARIUS. No.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. You see, Miss Glory, the Robots have no interest in life. They\r\nhave no enjoyments. They are _less_ than so much grass.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, stop. Please send them away.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Pushes button_) Marius, Sulla, you may go. (_MARIUS pivots and\r\nexits R. SULLA exits L._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. How terrible! (_To C._) It\xe2\x80\x99s outrageous what you are doing.\r\n(_He takes her hand._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Why outrageous? (_His hand over hers. Laughing._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but it is. Why do you call her \xe2\x80\x9cSulla\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a nice name? (_Hand away._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. It\xe2\x80\x99s a man\xe2\x80\x99s name. Sulla was a Roman General.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What! Oh! (_Laughs_) We thought that Marius and Sulla were\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Indignantly_) Marius and Sulla were generals and fought\r\nagainst each other in the year--I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten now.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Laughing_) Come here to the window. (_He goes to window C._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. What?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Come here. (_She goes._) Do you see anything? (_Takes her arm.\r\nShe is on his R._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Bricklayers.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Robots. All our work people are Robots. And down there, can you\r\nsee anything?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Some sort of office.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. A counting house. And in it--\r\n\r\nHELENA. A lot of officials.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Robots! All our officials are Robots. And when you see the\r\nfactory-- (_Noon WHISTLE blows. She is scared; puts arm on DOMIN. He\r\nlaughs_) If we don\xe2\x80\x99t blow the whistle the Robots won\xe2\x80\x99t stop working. In\r\ntwo hours I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the kneading trough. (_BOTH come down stage.\r\nHELENA is L.C. and DOMIN is R.C., arm in arm._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Kneading trough?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. The pestle for beating up the paste. In each one we mix the\r\ningredients for a thousand Robots at one operation. Then there are the\r\nvats for the preparation of liver, brains, and so on. Then you will\r\nsee the bone factory. After that I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the spinning mill.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Spinning mill?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes. For weaving nerves and veins. Miles and miles of digestive\r\ntubes pass through it at a time.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Watching his gestures_) Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t we talk about something else?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Perhaps it would be better. There\xe2\x80\x99s only a _handful_ of us among\r\na hundred thousand Robots, and _not one woman_. We talk nothing but the\r\nfactory _all_ day, and _every_ day. It\xe2\x80\x99s just as if we were under a\r\ncurse, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I\xe2\x80\x99m _sorry_ I said that you were lying. (_A KNOCK at door R._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Come in.

Welcome, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Rushes in from R._) Hello, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Come in, Busman. This is President Glory\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. This is\r\nBusman, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. By Jove, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. (_ALL click heels. He crowds in and\r\nshakes her hand_) Miss Glory, may we send a cablegram to the papers\r\nabout your arrival?\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, no, please don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nDOMIN.

Wavering, then in desperate resolution_) Tell me,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it ever distress you the way you are treated?\r\n\r\nFABRY. By whom, may I ask?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why, everybody.\r\n\r\nALQUIST.

Yes, the officials, but not the _managers_. Allow me, Miss\r\nGlory--this is Consul Busman, General Business Manager; this is Doctor\r\nFabry, General Technical Manager; Doctor Hallemeier, head of the\r\nInstitute for the Psychological Training of Robots; Doctor Gall, head\r\nof the Psychological and Experimental Department; and Alquist, head\r\nof the Building Department, R. U. R. (_As they are introduced they\r\nrise and come C. to kiss her hand, except GALL and ALQUIST, whom DOMIN\r\npushes away. General babble._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Just a builder.

Certainly not.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Well, now, Miss Glory, it is certainly nice to have you with us.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Seriously_) But you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to disturb your Robots for\r\nyou. (_BUSMAN pulls chair closer._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Mocking her serious tone_) My dear Miss Glory-- (_Chuckle_)\r\n--we\xe2\x80\x99ve had close upon a hundred saviors and prophets here. Every ship\r\nbrings us some. Missionaries, Anarchists, Salvation Army, all sorts!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing what a number of churches and idiots there are in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And yet you let them speak to the Robots.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. So far we\xe2\x80\x99ve let them all. Why not? The Robot remembers\r\neverything but that\xe2\x80\x99s all. They don\xe2\x80\x99t even laugh at what the people\r\nsay. Really it\xe2\x80\x99s quite incredible.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I\xe2\x80\x99m a stupid girl. Send me back by the first ship.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Not for anything in the world, Miss Glory. Why should we send\r\nyou back?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. If it would amuse you, Miss Glory, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you down to the\r\nRobot warehouse. It holds about three hundred thousand of them.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Three hundred and forty-seven thousand.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Good, and you can say whatever you like to them. You can read\r\nthe Bible, recite the multiplication table, whatever you please. You\r\ncan even preach to them about human rights.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, I think that if you were to show them a little love.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Impossible, Miss Glory! _Nothing is harder to like than a Robot._\r\n\r\nHELENA. What do you make them for, then?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Ha, ha, ha! That\xe2\x80\x99s good. What are Robots made for?\r\n\r\nFABRY. For _work_, Miss Glory. One Robot can replace two and a half\r\n_workmen_. The human machine, Miss Glory, was terribly _imperfect_. It\r\nhad to be removed sooner or later.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. It was too expensive.\r\n\r\nFABRY. It was not _effective_. It no longer answers the requirements of\r\n_modern engineering_. Nature has no idea of keeping pace with _modern\r\nlabor_. For example, from a technical point of view, the whole of\r\n_childhood_ is a sheer absurdity. So much time lost. And then again--\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Turns to DOMIN_) Oh, no, no!\r\n\r\nFABRY. Pardon me. What is the real _aim_ of your League--the--the\r\nHumanity League?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Its real purpose is to--to protect the Robots--and--and to\r\ninsure good treatment for them.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Not a bad object, either. A machine has to be treated properly.\r\n(_Leans back_) _I don\xe2\x80\x99t like damaged articles._ Please, Miss Glory,\r\nenroll us all _members_ of your league. (_\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d from all MEN._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand me. What we really want is\r\nto--to--_liberate_ the Robots. (_Looks at all OTHERS._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. How do you propose to do that?\r\n\r\nHELENA. They are to be--to be dealt with like human beings.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Aha! I suppose they\xe2\x80\x99re to vote. To drink beer. To order us\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they drink beer?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99re even to receive wages? (_Looking at other\r\nMEN, amused._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Of course they are.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Fancy that! Now! And what would they do with their wages,\r\npray?\r\n\r\nHELENA. They would buy--what they want--what pleases them.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. That would be very nice, Miss Glory, only there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nthat does please the Robots. Good heavens, what are they to buy? You\r\ncan feed them on pineapples, straw, whatever you like. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the\r\n_same_ to them. They\xe2\x80\x99ve no appetite at all. They\xe2\x80\x99ve no interest in\r\nanything. Why, hang it all, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s ever yet seen a Robot smile.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why--why don\xe2\x80\x99t you make them--happier?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, Miss Glory. They are only workmen.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, but they\xe2\x80\x99re so intelligent.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Confoundedly so, but they\xe2\x80\x99re nothing else. They\xe2\x80\x99ve no will\r\nof their own. No soul. No passion.\r\n\r\nHELENA. No love?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Love? Huh! Rather not. Robots don\xe2\x80\x99t love. Not even\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHELENA. No defiance?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Defiance? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Only _rarely_, from time to time.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What happens then?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Nothing particular. Occasionally they seem to go off their\r\n_heads_. Something like epilepsy, you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cRobot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCramp.\xe2\x80\x9d They\xe2\x80\x99ll suddenly sling down everything they\xe2\x80\x99re holding,\r\nstand still, gnash their teeth--and then they have to go into the\r\nstamping-mill. It\xe2\x80\x99s evidently some breakdown in the mechanism.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Sitting on desk_) A flaw in the works that has to be removed.\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s the soul.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Humorously_) Do you think that the soul first shows itself by\r\na gnashing of teeth? (_MEN chuckle._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s just a sign that there\xe2\x80\x99s a struggle within.\r\nPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of revolt. Oh, if you could infuse them with it.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be remedied, Miss Glory. Doctor Gall is just making some\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Not with regard to that, Domin. At present I am making _pain_\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Pain nerves?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Yes, the Robots feel practically no bodily pain. You see,\r\nyoung Rossum provided them with too limited a _nervous_ system. We\r\n_must_ introduce _suffering_.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why do you want to cause them pain?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. For industrial reasons, Miss Glory. Sometimes a Robot does\r\ndamage to himself because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him. He puts his hand\r\ninto the machine-- (_Describes with gesture_) --breaks his finger--\r\n(_Describes with gesture_) --smashes his head. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to\r\nhim. We must provide them with _pain_. That\xe2\x80\x99s an automatic _protection_\r\nagainst damage.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Will they be happier when they feel pain?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. On the contrary; but they will be more perfect from a\r\ntechnical point of view.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you create a soul for them?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. That\xe2\x80\x99s not in our power.\r\n\r\nFABRY. That\xe2\x80\x99s not in our interest.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. That would increase the cost of production. Hang it all, my\r\ndear young lady, we turn them out at such a cheap rate--a hundred and\r\nfifty dollars each, fully dressed, and fifteen years ago they cost ten\r\nthousand. Five years ago we used to buy the _clothes_ for them. Today\r\nwe have our own weaving mill, and now we even _export_ cloth five times\r\ncheaper than other factories. What do you pay a yard for cloth, Miss\r\nGlory?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Looking at DOMIN_) I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Good gracious, and you want to found a Humanity League. (_MEN\r\nchuckle._) It only costs a third now, Miss Glory. All prices are today\r\na third of what they were and they\xe2\x80\x99ll fall still lower, lower, like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Why, bless you, Miss Glory, it means that the cost of _labor_\r\nhas fallen. A Robot, food and all, costs three-quarters of a cent\r\nper hour. (_Leans forward_) That\xe2\x80\x99s mighty important, you know. All\r\nfactories will go pop like chestnuts if they don\xe2\x80\x99t at once buy Robots\r\nto lower the cost of production.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And get rid of all their workmen?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Of course. But in the meantime we\xe2\x80\x99ve dumped five hundred\r\nthousand _tropical_ Robots down on the Argentine pampas to grow corn.\r\nWould you mind telling me how much you pay a pound for bread?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea. (_ALL smile._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. It now costs two cents in good old\r\nEurope. A pound of bread for two cents, and the _Humanity League_--\r\n(_Designates HELENA_) --knows nothing about it. (_To MEN_) Miss\r\nGlory, you don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that even _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ too expensive. (_All MEN\r\nchuckle._) Why, in five years\xe2\x80\x99 time I\xe2\x80\x99ll wager--\r\n\r\nHELENA. What?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. That the cost of everything will be a tenth of what it\r\nis today. Why, in five years we\xe2\x80\x99ll be up to our ears in corn\r\nand--everything else.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Yes, and all the workers throughout the world will be\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Seriously. Rises_) Yes, Alquist, they will. Yes, Miss Glory,\r\nthey will. But in ten years Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s Universal Robots will produce so\r\nmuch _corn_, so much _cloth_, so much everything that things will be\r\npractically without price. There will be no poverty. All work will\r\nbe done by living machines. Everybody will be free from worry and\r\nliberated from the degradation of labor. Everybody will live only to\r\n_perfect_ himself.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Will he?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Of course. It\xe2\x80\x99s bound to happen. Then the servitude of man to\r\nman and the enslavement of man to matter will cease. Nobody will get\r\nbread at the cost of life and hatred. The Robots will wash the feet of\r\nthe beggar and prepare a bed for him in his house.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Domin, Domin, what you say sounds too much like Paradise.\r\nThere was something _good_ in _service_ and something _great_ in\r\nhumility. There was some kind of virtue in _toil_ and _weariness_.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Perhaps, but we cannot reckon with what is lost when we start\r\nout to transform the world. Man shall be _free_ and supreme; he shall\r\nhave no other aim, no other labor, no other care than to perfect\r\nhimself. He shall serve neither matter nor man. He will not be a\r\nmachine and a device for production. He will be _Lord_ of creation.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Amen.\r\n\r\nFABRY. So be it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Rises_) You have bewildered me. I should like to believe this.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. You are younger than we are, Miss Glory. You will live to see\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. True. (_Looking around_) Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think Miss Glory might\r\nlunch with us? (_All MEN rise._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Of course. Domin, ask her on behalf of us all.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Miss Glory, will you do us the honor?\r\n\r\nHELENA. When you know why I\xe2\x80\x99ve come?\r\n\r\nFABRY. For the League of Humanity, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, in that case perhaps--\r\n\r\nFABRY. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine. (_Pause_) Miss Glory, excuse me for five minutes.\r\n(_Exits R._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Thank you. (_Exits R. with DR. GALL._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Whispering_) I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back soon. (_Beckoning to ALQUIST, they\r\nexit._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Starts, stops, then to HELENA, then to door_) I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back\r\nin exactly five minutes. (_Exits R._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. What have they all gone for?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. To cook, Miss Glory. (_On her L._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. To cook what?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Lunch. (_They laugh; takes her hand_) The Robots do our cooking\r\nfor us and as they\xe2\x80\x99ve no taste it\xe2\x80\x99s not altogether-- (_She laughs._)\r\nHallemeier is awfully _good_ at grills and Gall can make any kind of\r\nsauce, and Busman knows all about omelets.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What a feast! And what\xe2\x80\x99s the specialty of Mr.--your builder?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Alquist? Nothing. He only lays the table. And Fabry will get\r\ntogether a little fruit. Our cuisine is very modest, Miss Glory.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Thoughtfully_) I wanted to ask you something--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. And I wanted to ask you something too--they\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in five\r\nminutes. (_Looks at door R._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. What did you want to ask me? (_Sits C._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Excuse me, you asked first. (_Sits L. of her._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s silly of me, but why do you manufacture female\r\nRobots when--when--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. When sex means nothing to them?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain demand for them, you see. Servants,\r\nsaleswomen, stenographers. People are _used_ to it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But--but tell me, are the Robots male and female,\r\nmutually--completely without--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Completely indifferent to each other, Miss Glory. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nsign of any _affection_ between them.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Why?\r\n\r\nHELENA. It\xe2\x80\x99s so unnatural. One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to be disgusted or\r\nto hate them, or perhaps--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. To pity them. (_Smiles._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. That\xe2\x80\x99s more like it. What did you want to ask _me_?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I should like to ask you, Miss Helena, if you will marry me.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What? (_Rises._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Will you be my wife? (_Rises._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. No. The idea!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_To her, looking at his watch_) Another three minutes. If you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t marry me you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to marry one of the other five.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But why should I?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Because they\xe2\x80\x99re _all_ going to ask you in turn.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Crossing him to L.C._) How could they dare do such a thing?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, Miss Glory. It seems they\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen in love with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t let them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll--I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away at once. (_Starts R.\r\nHe stops her, his arms up._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Helena-- (_She backs away to desk. He follows_) You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nso cruel as to refuse us.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But, but--I can\xe2\x80\x99t marry all six.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. No, but one anyhow. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want _me_, marry Fabry.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Ah! Doctor Gall?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any of you.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Another two minutes. (_Pleading. Looking at watch._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. I think you\xe2\x80\x99d marry any woman who came here.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. _Plenty_ of them have come, Helena.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Laughing_) Young?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you marry one of _them_?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose my head. Until today--then as soon as you\r\nlifted your veil-- (_HELENA turns her head away._) Another minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (_WARN Curtain._)\r\n\r\n\r\nHELENA. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you, I tell you.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Laying both hands on her shoulder_) One more minute! Now you\r\neither have to look me straight in the eye and say \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d violently, and\r\nthen I leave you alone--or-- (_HELENA looks at him. He takes hands\r\naway. She takes his hand again._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Turning her head away_) You\xe2\x80\x99re mad.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. A man _has_ to be a bit mad, Helena. That\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing about\r\nhim. (_He draws her to him._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Not meaning it_) You are--you are--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Well?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99re hurting me!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. The last chance, Helena. Now or never--\r\n\r\nHELENA. But--but-- (_He embraces her; kisses her. She embraces him.\r\nKNOCKING at R. door._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Releasing her_) Come in. (_She lays her head on his shoulder._)\r\n\r\n  (_Enter BUSMAN, GALL and HALLEMEIER in kitchen aprons, FABRY with a\r\n  bouquet and ALQUIST with a napkin under his arm._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Have you finished your job?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. So have we. (_He embraces her. The MEN rush around them and\r\noffer congratulations._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURTAIN FALLS QUICKLY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT TWO\r\n\r\nSCENE: _HELENA\xe2\x80\x99S drawing room. Ten years later. The skeleton\r\n  framework of Act I is still used. Tall windows put in back instead\r\n  of Act I windows. Steel shutters for these windows. Where the green\r\n  cabinet of Act I at Left has stood is a door, L.2, leading to the\r\n  outside. Where the cabinet stood at Right, a fireplace is placed. The\r\n  tall open hallway R.C. of Act I is blocked up with a flat piece. The\r\n  doors at Right and Left 1 have been changed to those of a drawing\r\n  room. Door at Right leads to HELENA\xe2\x80\x99S bedroom. Door at Left 1 leads\r\n  to library._\r\n\r\n  _The furniture consists of a reading table at Left Center covered\r\n  with magazines. A chair to the Left of table. In front of table is an\r\n  armchair covered in chintz. A couch Right Center and back of it is a\r\n  small table with books and book-ends. On this table a small reading\r\n  lamp. At Right between doorway and fireplace is a small table. There\r\n  is a work-basket upon it, with pincushion, needles, etc. Down stage\r\n  at Right and facing the couch is another armchair used by ALQUIST.\r\n  To the Left of fireplace is a straight-backed chair. Upstage at Left\r\n  near the L.2 door to the outside is a writing desk. There is a lamp\r\n  upon it, writing paper, etc., a telephone and binoculars._\r\n\r\n  _The walls of the room have been covered with silk to the height\r\n  of seven feet. This is done in small flats to fit the different\r\n  spaces and are in place against the permanent set. The two French\r\n  windows open into the room. At the rise they are open. There is a\r\n  balcony beyond looking over the harbor. The same telegraph wires and\r\n  poles from Act I are again visible through the window. The windows\r\n  are trimmed with gray lace curtains. Binoculars on desk up stage by\r\n  television._\r\n\r\n  _It is about nine in the morning and SUNLIGHT streams into the room\r\n  through the open windows. DOMIN opens the door L.2; tiptoes in. He\r\n  carries a potted plant. He beckons the OTHERS to follow him, and\r\n  HALLEMEIER and FABRY enter, both carrying a potted plant.

(_Putting down his flowers on L.C. table and indicates the\r\ndoor R._) Still asleep?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Well, as long as she\xe2\x80\x99s asleep she can\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it.\r\n(_He remains at L.C. table._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. She knows nothing about it. (_At C._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Putting plant on writing desk_) I certainly hope nothing\r\nhappens today.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. For goodness sake drop it all. Look, this is a fine\r\ncyclamen, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? A new sort, my latest--Cyclamen Helena.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Picks up binoculars and goes out into balcony_) No signs of\r\nthe ship. Things must be pretty bad.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Be quiet. Suppose she heard you.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Coming into room, puts glasses on desk_) Well, anyway the\r\n_Ultimus_ arrived just in time.\r\n\r\nFABRY. You really think that today--?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. (_He crosses to L.C. table_) Aren\xe2\x80\x99t the flowers\r\nfine?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Fondles flowers_) These are my primroses. And this\r\nis my new jasmine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered a wonderful way of developing\r\nflowers quickly. Splendid varieties, too. Next year I\xe2\x80\x99ll be developing\r\nmarvelous ones.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What next year?\r\n\r\nFABRY. I\xe2\x80\x99d give a good deal to know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening at Havre with--\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Off R._) Nana.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Keep quiet. She\xe2\x80\x99s awake. Out you go. (_ALL go out on tiptoe\r\nthrough L.2 door. Enter NANA L.1_)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Calling from R._) Nana?\r\n\r\nNANA. Horrid mess! Pack of heathens. If I had _my_ say, I\xe2\x80\x99d--\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Backwards in the doorway from R._) Nana, come and do up my\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nNANA. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming. So you\xe2\x80\x99re up at last. (_Fastening HELENA\xe2\x80\x99S dress_) My\r\ngracious, what brutes!\r\n\r\nHELENA. Who? (_Turning._)\r\n\r\nNANA. If you want to turn _around_, then turn around, but I shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfasten you up.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Turns back_) What are you grumbling about now?\r\n\r\nNANA. These dreadful creatures, these heathens--\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Turning toward NANA again_) The Robots?\r\n\r\nNANA. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even call them by name.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\r\n\r\nNANA. Another of them here has caught it. He began to smash up the\r\nstatues and pictures in the drawing room; gnashed his teeth; foamed at\r\nthe mouth. Worse than an animal.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Which of them caught it?\r\n\r\nNANA. The one--well, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any _Christian_ name. The one in\r\ncharge of the library.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Radius?\r\n\r\nNANA. That\xe2\x80\x99s him. My goodness, I\xe2\x80\x99m scared of them. A spider doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nscare me as much as them.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But Nana, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you\xe2\x80\x99re not sorry for them.\r\n\r\nNANA. Why, you\xe2\x80\x99re scared of them too. You know you are. Why else did\r\nyou bring _me_ here?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I\xe2\x80\x99m not scared, really I\xe2\x80\x99m not, Nana. I\xe2\x80\x99m only sorry for them.\r\n\r\nNANA. You\xe2\x80\x99re scared. Nobody could _help_ being scared. Why, the dog\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscared of them. He won\xe2\x80\x99t take a scrap of meat out of their hands. He\r\ndraws in his tail and howls when he knows they\xe2\x80\x99re about.\r\n\r\nHELENA. The dog has no sense.\r\n\r\nNANA. He\xe2\x80\x99s better than _them_, and he knows it. Even the _horse_ shies\r\nwhen he meets them. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have any young, and a _dog_ has young,\r\n_everyone_ has young--\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Turning back_) Please fasten up my dress, Nana.\r\n\r\nNANA. I say it\xe2\x80\x99s against God\xe2\x80\x99s will to--\r\n\r\nHELENA. What is it that smells so nice?\r\n\r\nNANA. Flowers.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What for?\r\n\r\nNANA. Now you can turn around.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Turns; crosses to C._) Oh, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they lovely? Look, Nana.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening today?\r\n\r\nNANA. It ought to be the end of the world. (_Enter DOMIN L.2. He\r\ncrosses down front of table L.C._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Crosses to him_) Oh, hello, Harry. (_NANA turns upstage to\r\nL._) Harry, why all these flowers?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Guess. (_This scene is played down in front of L.C. table._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my _birthday_!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Better than that.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Tell me.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. It\xe2\x80\x99s ten years ago _today_ since you _came_ here.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Ten years? Today? Why-- (_They embrace._)\r\n\r\nNANA. (_Muttering_) I\xe2\x80\x99m off. (_She exits L.1._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Fancy you remembering.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I\xe2\x80\x99m really ashamed, Helena. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But you--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. _They_ remembered.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Who?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Busman, Hallemeier--_all_ of them. Put your hand in my pocket.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Takes necklace from his Left jacket pocket_) Oh! Pearls! A\r\nnecklace! Harry, is this for me?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. It\xe2\x80\x99s from Busman.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t accept it, can we?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Oh, yes, we can. (_Puts necklace on table L.C._) Put your hand\r\nin the other pocket.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Takes a revolver out of his Right pocket_) What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Sorry. Not that. Try again. (_He puts gun in pocket._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, Harry, why do you carry a revolver?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. It got there by mistake.\r\n\r\nHELENA. You never used to _carry_ one.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. No, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. (_Indicates breast pocket_) There, that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Takes out cameo_) A cameo. Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s a Greek cameo.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Apparently. Anyhow, Fabry says it is.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Fabry? Did Mr. Fabry give me that?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Of course. (_Opens the L.1 door_) And look in here. Helena, come\r\nand see this. (_BOTH exit L.1._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Off L.1_) Oh, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it fine? Is this from you?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Off L.1_) No, from Alquist. And there\xe2\x80\x99s another on the piano.\r\n\r\nHELENA. This must be from you?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. There\xe2\x80\x99s a card on it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. From Doctor Gall. (_Reappearing in L.1 doorway_) Oh, Harry, I\r\nfeel embarrassed at so much kindness.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Enters to up R. of table L.C._) Come here. This is what\r\nHallemeier brought you.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_To up L. of desk_) These beautiful flowers?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new kind. Cyclamen-Helena. He grew them in honor of\r\n_you_. They are almost as beautiful as you.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Kissing him_) Harry, why do they all--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. They\xe2\x80\x99re awfully fond of you. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that my present is a\r\nlittle--Look out of the window. (_Crosses to window and beckons to\r\nher._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Where? (_They go out into the balcony._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Into the harbor.\r\n\r\nHELENA. There\xe2\x80\x99s a new ship.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. That\xe2\x80\x99s _your_ ship.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Mine? How do you mean?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_R._) For you to take trips in--for your amusement.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_L._) Harry, that\xe2\x80\x99s a gunboat.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. A gunboat? What are you thinking of? It\xe2\x80\x99s only a little _bigger_\r\nand more _solid_ than most ships.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes, but with guns.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Oh, yes, with a few guns. You\xe2\x80\x99ll travel like a _queen_, Helena.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of it? Has anything happened?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Good heavens, no. I say, try these pearls. (_Crosses to R. of\r\ntable L.C._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Harry, have you had bad news?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. On the contrary, no letters have arrived for a whole week.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Nor telegrams? (_Coming into the room C._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Nor telegrams.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What does that mean?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. _Holidays_ for us! We all sit in the office with our feet on the\r\ntable and take a nap. No letters--no telegrams. Glorious!\r\n\r\nHELENA. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with me today?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Certainly. (_Embraces her_) That is, we will see. Do you\r\nremember ten years ago today? (_Crosses to L. of table L.C._) Miss\r\nGlory, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great honor to welcome you. (_They assume the same\r\npositions as when they first met ten years before in DOMIN\xe2\x80\x99S office._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_To table_) Oh, Mr. Manager, I\xe2\x80\x99m so interested in your\r\nfactory. (_She sits R. of table._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Miss Glory, it\xe2\x80\x99s strictly forbidden. The manufacture\r\nof artificial people is a secret.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But to oblige the young lady who has come a long way.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Leans on table_) Certainly, Miss Glory. I have no secrets from\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Are you sure, Harry? (_Leaning on desk, seriously, his right\r\nhand on hers._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. _Yes._ (_They gradually draw apart._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. But I warn you, sir, this young lady intends to do terrible\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Good gracious, Miss Glory. Perhaps she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry me.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Heaven forbid. She never dreamt of such a thing. But she came\r\nhere intending to stir up a _revolt_ among your _Robots_.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. A revolt of the Robots!\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Low voice_) Harry, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Laughing it off_) _A revolt of the Robots_, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fine\r\nidea. (_Crosses to back of table. She watches him suspiciously._) Miss\r\nGlory, it would be easier for you to cause bolts and screws to rebel\r\nthan our Robots. You know, Helena, you\xe2\x80\x99re wonderful. You\xe2\x80\x99ve turned the\r\nhearts of us all. (_Sits on table._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, I was fearfully impressed by you all then. You were all so\r\nsure of yourselves, so strong. I seemed like a tiny little girl who had\r\nlost her way among--among--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Front_) Among huge trees. All my feelings were so _trifling_\r\ncompared with your _self-confidence_. And in all these years I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\n_lost_ this anxiety. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt the _least_ misgiving, not\r\neven when everything went wrong.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What went wrong?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Your plans. You remember, Harry, when the workmen in America\r\nrevolted against the Robots and smashed them up, and when the people\r\ngave the Robots firearms against the rebels. And then when the\r\ngovernments turned the Robots into soldiers, and there were so many\r\n_wars_.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Getting up and walking about_) We foresaw that, Helena.\r\n(_Around table to R.C._) You see, these are only passing troubles\r\nwhich are bound to happen before the new conditions are _established_.\r\n(_Walking up and down, standing at Center._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. You were all so powerful, so overwhelming. The _whole world_\r\nbowed down before you. (_Rising_) Oh, Harry! (_Crosses to him._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What is it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Close the factory and let\xe2\x80\x99s go away. All of us.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I say, what\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of this?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But can\xe2\x80\x99t we go away?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Impossible, Helena! That is, at this particular moment--\r\n\r\nHELENA. At once, Harry. I\xe2\x80\x99m so frightened.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Takes her_) About what, Helena?\r\n\r\nHELENA. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if something was falling on top of us, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe stopped. Oh, take us all away from here. We\xe2\x80\x99ll find a place in the\r\nworld where there\xe2\x80\x99s no one else. Alquist will build us a house, and\r\nthen we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin life all over again. (_The TELEPHONE rings._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Crosses to telephone on desk up L._) Excuse me. Hello--yes,\r\nwhat? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there at once. Fabry is calling me, my dear. (_Crosses\r\nL._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Tell me-- (_She rushes up to him._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes, when I come back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go out of the house, dear. (_Exits\r\nL.2._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. He won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. (_NANA brings in a water carafe from L.1._)\r\nNana, find me the latest newspapers. Quickly. Look in Mr. Domin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom.\r\n\r\nNANA. All right. (_Crosses R._) He leaves them all over the place.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how they get crumpled up. (_Continues muttering. Exits R._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Looking through binoculars at the harbor_) That\xe2\x80\x99s a warship.\r\nU-l-t-i--_Ultimus_. They\xe2\x80\x99re loading.\r\n\r\nNANA. (_Enters R. with newspapers_) Here they are. See how they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncrumpled up.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Crosses down_) They\xe2\x80\x99re old ones. A week old. (_Drops papers.\r\nBOTH at front of couch. NANA sits R. of table L.C. Puts on spectacles.\r\nReads the newspapers._) Something\xe2\x80\x99s happening, Nana.\r\n\r\nNANA. Very likely. It always does. (_Spelling out the words_) \xe2\x80\x9cW-a-r in\r\nB-a-l-k-a-n-s.\xe2\x80\x9d Is that far off?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t read it. It\xe2\x80\x99s always the same. Always wars! (_Sits on\r\ncouch._)\r\n\r\nNANA. What else do you _expect_? Why do you _keep_ selling thousands\r\nand thousands of these heathens as soldiers?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I suppose it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, Nana. We can\xe2\x80\x99t know--Domin can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what they\xe2\x80\x99re to be used for. When an order comes for them he must\r\njust send them.\r\n\r\nNANA. He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make them. (_Reading from newspaper_) \xe2\x80\x9cThe Robot\r\nsoldiers spare no-body in the occ-up-ied terr-it-ory. They have\r\nass-ass-ass-inat-ed ov-er sev-en hundred thous-and cit-iz-ens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCitizens, if you please.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Rises and crosses and takes paper_) It can\xe2\x80\x99t be. Let me see.\r\n(_Crossing to NANA_) They have assassinated over seven hundred thousand\r\ncitizens, evidently at the order of their commander. (_Drops paper;\r\ncrosses up C._)\r\n\r\nNANA. (_Spelling out the words from other paper she has picked up from\r\nthe floor_) \xe2\x80\x9cRe-bell-ion in Ma-drid a-gainst the gov-ern-ment. Rob-ot\r\nin-fant-ry fires on the crowd. Nine thou-sand killed and wounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, stop! (_Goes up and looks toward the harbor._)\r\n\r\nNANA. Here\xe2\x80\x99s something printed in big letters. \xe2\x80\x9cLatest news. At Havre\r\nthe first org-an-iz-a-tion of Rob-ots has been e-stab-lished. Rob-ots\r\nwork-men, sail-ors and sold-iers have iss-ued a man-i-fest-o to all\r\nRob-ots through-out the world.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that. That\xe2\x80\x99s got no\r\nsense. Oh, good gracious, another murder.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Up C._) Take those papers away now.\r\n\r\nNANA. Wait a bit. Here\xe2\x80\x99s something in still bigger type. \xe2\x80\x9cStat-ist-ics\r\nof pop-ul-a-tion.\xe2\x80\x9d What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Coming down to NANA_) Let me see. (_Reads_) \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the past\r\nweek there has again not been a single birth recorded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNANA. What\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of that? (_Drops paper._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Nana, no more _people_ are being born.\r\n\r\nNANA. That\xe2\x80\x99s the end, then? (_Removing spectacles_) We\xe2\x80\x99re done for.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that.\r\n\r\nNANA. No more people are being born. That\xe2\x80\x99s a punishment, that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Nana!\r\n\r\nNANA. (_Standing up_) That\xe2\x80\x99s the end of the world. (_Repeat until off.\r\nPicks paper up from floor. She exits L.1._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Goes up to window_) Oh, Mr. Alquist. (_ALQUIST off L.2._)\r\nWill you come here? Oh, come just as you are. You look very nice in\r\nyour mason\xe2\x80\x99s overalls. (_ALQUIST enters L.2, his hands soiled with lime\r\nand brick dust. She goes to end of sofa and meets him C._) Dear Mr.\r\nAlquist, it was awfully kind of you, that lovely present.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. My hands are soiled. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been _experimenting_ with that new\r\ncement.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Never mind. Please sit down. (_Sits on couch. He sits on her\r\nL._) Mr. Alquist, what\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of _Ultimus_?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. The last. Why?\r\n\r\nHELENA. That\xe2\x80\x99s the name of my new ship. Have you seen it? Do you think\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re off soon--on a trip?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Perhaps _very_ soon.\r\n\r\nHELENA. All of you with me?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I should like us _all_ to be there.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What _is_ the matter?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Things are just moving on.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Dear Mr. Alquist, I know something dreadful has happened.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Has your husband _told_ you anything?\r\n\r\nHELENA. No. _Nobody_ will tell me anything. But I feel--Is anything the\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Not that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of yet.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I feel so nervous. Don\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ ever feel nervous?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m an old man, you know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got old-fashioned ways.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of all this progress, and these new-fangled ideas.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Like Nana?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Yes, like Nana. Has Nana got a prayer book?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes, a big thick one.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. And has it got prayers for various occasions? Against\r\nthunderstorms? Against illness? But not against _progress_?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pity.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why, do you mean you\xe2\x80\x99d like to pray?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I _do_ pray.\r\n\r\nHELENA. How?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Something like this: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord, I thank thee for having given\r\nme toil; enlighten Domin and all those who are astray; destroy their\r\nwork, and aid mankind to return to their labors; let them not suffer\r\nharm in soul or body; deliver us from the Robots, and protect Helena.\r\nAmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Touches his arm; pats it_) Mr. Alquist, are you a believer?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And yet you pray?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. That\xe2\x80\x99s better than _worrying_ about it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for you?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Ironically_) It _has_ to be.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But if you thought you saw the destruction of mankind coming\r\nupon us--\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I _do_ see it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. You mean mankind will be destroyed?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. It\xe2\x80\x99s bound to be unless--unless.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Nothing. (_Pats her shoulder. Rises_) Goodbye. (_Exits L.2._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Rises. Calling_) Nana, Nana! (_NANA enters L.1._) Is Radius\r\nstill there?\r\n\r\nNANA. (_L.C._) The one who went mad? They haven\xe2\x80\x99t come for him yet.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Is he still raving?\r\n\r\nNANA. No. He\xe2\x80\x99s tied up.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Please bring him here.\r\n\r\nNANA. What?\r\n\r\nHELENA. At once, Nana. (_Exits NANA L.1. HELENA to telephone_) Hello,\r\nDoctor Gall, please. Oh, good day, Doctor. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s Helena. Thanks\r\nfor your lovely present. Could you come and see me right away? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimportant. Thank you. (_Enter RADIUS L.1; looks at HELENA, then turns\r\nhead up L. She crosses to him, L.C._) Poor Radius, you\xe2\x80\x99ve caught it\r\ntoo? Now they\xe2\x80\x99ll send you to the stamping mill. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you control\r\nyourself? Why did it happen? You see, Radius, you are more intelligent\r\nthan the rest. Doctor Gall took such trouble to make you different.\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\r\n\r\nRADIUS. (_Looking at her_) Send me to the stamping mill. (_Open and\r\nclose fists._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to kill you. What was the trouble, Radius?\r\n\r\nRADIUS. (_Two steps toward her. Opens and closes fists_) I won\xe2\x80\x99t work\r\nfor you. Put me into the stamping mill.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Do you hate us? Why?\r\n\r\nRADIUS. You are not as strong as the Robots. You are not as skillful as\r\nthe Robots. The Robots can do everything. You only give orders. You do\r\nnothing but talk.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But someone must give orders.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a master. I know everything for myself.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Radius! Doctor Gall gave you a better brain than the rest,\r\nbetter than ours. You are the only one of the Robots that understands\r\nperfectly. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I had you put into the library, so that you could\r\nread everything, understand everything, and then, oh, Radius--I wanted\r\nyou to show the whole world that the Robots are our equals. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI wanted of you.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a master. I want to be master over others.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99d put you in charge of _many_ Robots. You would\r\nbe a _teacher_ of the Robots.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. I want to be master over people. (_Head up. Pride._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Staggering_) You are mad.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. (_Head down low, crosses toward L.; opens hands_) Then send me\r\nto the stamping mill.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Steps to him_) Do you think we\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of you? (_Rushing to\r\ndesk and writing note._)\r\n\r\nRADIUS. (_Turns his head uneasily_) What are you going to do? What are\r\nyou going to do? (_Starts for her._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Crosses to R. of him_) Radius! (_He cowers. Body sways._)\r\nGive this note to Mr. Domin. (_He faces her._) It asks them not to send\r\nyou to the stamping mill. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you hate us so.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Enters L.2; goes to C. upstage_) You wanted me?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Backs away_) It\xe2\x80\x99s about Radius, Doctor. He had an attack this\r\nmorning. He smashed the statues downstairs.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Looks at him_) What a pity to _lose_ him. (_At C._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Radius isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be put into the stamping mill. (_Stands\r\nto the R. of GALL._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. But every Robot after he has had an attack--it\xe2\x80\x99s a strict\r\norder.\r\n\r\nHELENA. No matter--Radius isn\xe2\x80\x99t going, if I can _prevent_ it.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. But I warn you. It\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous. Come here to the window,\r\nmy good fellow. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look. Please give me a needle or a pin.\r\n(_Crosses up R. RADIUS follows. HELENA gets a needle from work-basket\r\non table R._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. What for?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. A test. (_HELENA gives him the needle. GALL crosses up to\r\nRADIUS, who faces him. Sticks it into his hand and RADIUS gives a\r\nviolent start._) _Gently, gently._ (_Opens the jacket of RADIUS and\r\nputs his ear to his heart_) Radius, you are going into the stamping\r\nmill, do you understand? There they\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you-- (_Takes glasses off\r\nand cleans them_) --and grind you to powder. (_RADIUS opens hands and\r\nfingers._) That\xe2\x80\x99s terribly painful. It will make you scream aloud.\r\n(_Opens RADIUS\xe2\x80\x99S eye. RADIUS trembles._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Doctor-- (_Standing near couch._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. No, no, Radius, I was wrong. I forgot that Madame Domin has\r\nput in a good word for you, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be left off. (_Listens to\r\nheart_) Ah, that _does_ make a difference. (_RADIUS relaxes. Again\r\nlistens to his heart for a reaction_) All right--you can go.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. You do unnecessary things-- (_Exit RADIUS L.2._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Speaks to her--very concerned_) Reaction of the pupils,\r\nincrease of sensitiveness. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an attack characteristic of the\r\nRobots.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What was it, then? (_Sits in couch._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_C._) Heaven knows. Stubbornness, anger or revolt--I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. And his heart, too.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. It was fluttering with nervousness like a _human_ heart. He\r\nwas all in a sweat with fear, and--do you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the\r\nrascal is a Robot _at all_ any longer.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Doctor, has Radius a soul?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Over to couch_) He\xe2\x80\x99s got something nasty.\r\n\r\nHELENA. If you knew how he hates us. Oh, Doctor, are all your Robots\r\nlike that? All the new ones that you began to make in a different way?\r\n(_She invites him to sit beside her. He sits._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Well, some are more sensitive than others. They\xe2\x80\x99re all more\r\nhuman beings than Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s Robots were.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Perhaps this hatred is more like human beings, too?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. That too is _progress_.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What became of the girl you made, the one who was most like us?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Your favorite? I _kept_ her. She\xe2\x80\x99s lovely, but stupid. No\r\ngood for work.\r\n\r\nHELENA. But she\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. I called her \xe2\x80\x9cHelena.\xe2\x80\x9d I wanted her to resemble _you_. She is\r\na failure.\r\n\r\nHELENA. In what way?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. She goes about as if in a dream, remote and listless. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwithout life. I watch and wait for a miracle to happen. Sometimes I\r\nthink to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were to wake up only for a moment you would\r\n_kill_ me for having _made_ you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHELENA. And yet you go _on_ making Robots! Why are no more children\r\nbeing born?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, but you must. Tell me.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. You see, so many Robots are being manufactured that people\r\nare becoming superfluous. Man is really a survival, but that he should\r\ndie out, after a paltry thirty years of competition, that\xe2\x80\x99s the awful\r\npart of it. You might almost think that Nature was _offended_ at the\r\nmanufacture of the Robots, but we still have old Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes. In that strong box.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. We go on using it and making Robots. All the universities are\r\nsending in long petitions to restrict their production. Otherwise, they\r\nsay, mankind will become extinct through lack of fertility. But the R.\r\nU. R. shareholders, of course, won\xe2\x80\x99t hear of it. All the governments,\r\non the other hand, are clamoring for an increase in production, to\r\nraise the standards of their armies. And all the manufacturers in the\r\nworld are ordering Robots like mad.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And has no one demanded that the manufacture should cease\r\naltogether?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. No one has courage.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Courage!\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. People would stone him to death. You see, after all, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore convenient to get your work done by the Robots.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, Doctor, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to become of people?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. God knows. Madame Helena, it looks to us scientists like the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_She looks out front. Rising_) Thank you for coming and\r\ntelling me.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Rises_) That means that you\xe2\x80\x99re sending me away.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes. (_Exit DR. GALL L.2. She crosses to L.C. To door L.1. With\r\nsudden resolution_) Nana! Nana! the fire, light it quickly. (_HELENA\r\nexits R._)\r\n\r\nNANA. (_Entering L.1_) What, light the fire in the summer?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Off R._) Yes!\r\n\r\nNANA. (_She looks for RADIUS_) Has that mad _Radius_ gone?--A fire\r\nin summer, what an idea? Nobody would think she\xe2\x80\x99d been _married_ ten\r\nyears. She\xe2\x80\x99s like a baby, no sense at all. A fire in summer. Like a\r\nbaby. (_She lights the fire._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Returns from R. with armful of faded papers. Back of couch\r\nto fireplace, L. of NANA_) Is it burning, Nana? All this has got to be\r\nburned.\r\n\r\nNANA. What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Old papers, fearfully old. Nana, shall I burn them?\r\n\r\nNANA. Are they any use?\r\n\r\nHELENA. _No._\r\n\r\nNANA. Well, then, burn them.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Throwing the first sheet on the fire_) What would you say,\r\nNana, if this was money and a lot of money? And if it was an invention,\r\nthe greatest invention in the world?\r\n\r\nNANA. (_R. of fireplace_) I\xe2\x80\x99d say burn it. All these new-fangled things\r\nare an offense to the Lord. It\xe2\x80\x99s downright wickedness. Wanting to\r\nimprove the world after He has made it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Look how they curl up. As if they were alive. Oh, Nana, how\r\nhorrible!\r\n\r\nNANA. Here, let me burn them.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Drawing back_) No, no, I must do it myself. Just look at the\r\nflames. They are like hands, like tongues, like living shapes. (_Raking\r\nfire with the poker_) Lie down, lie down.\r\n\r\nNANA. That\xe2\x80\x99s the end of them. (_Fireplace slowly out._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Nana, Nana!\r\n\r\nNANA. Good gracious, what is it you\xe2\x80\x99ve burned? (_Almost to herself._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Whatever have I done?\r\n\r\nNANA. Well, what is it? (_MEN\xe2\x80\x99S laughter off L.2._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Go quickly. It\xe2\x80\x99s the gentlemen calling.\r\n\r\nNANA. Good gracious, what a place! (_Exits L.1._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Opens door L.2_) Come along and offer your congratulations.\r\n(_Enter HALLEMEIER and DR. GALL._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to R.C._) Madame Helena, I congratulate you on\r\nthis festive day.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Thank you. (_Coming to C._) Where are Fabry and Busman?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. They\xe2\x80\x99ve gone down the harbor. (_Closes the door and comes to C._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Friends, we must _drink_ to this happy occasion.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Crosses L._) Brandy? With soda water? (_Exits L.1._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be temperate. No soda.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What\xe2\x80\x99s been burning here? Well, shall I tell her about it?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_L.C._) Of course. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over now.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to DOMIN. Embracing DOMIN_) It\xe2\x80\x99s all over now.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over now. (_They dance around DR. GALL in a circle._) It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nover now.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_In unison_) It\xe2\x80\x99s all over now. (_They keep repeating. Keep it\r\nafter HELENA is on._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Entering L.1 with decanter and glasses_) What\xe2\x80\x99s all over now?\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you all? (_She puts tray on L.C. table. DR. GALL\r\nhelps her to pour the drinks._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to back of table_) A piece of good luck. Madame\r\nDomin! (_ALL ad lib._) Just ten years ago today you arrived on this\r\nisland. (_HALLEMEIER crosses to table for drink._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. And now, ten years later to the minute-- (_Crosses to L. of\r\nHALLEMEIER._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. The same ship\xe2\x80\x99s returning to us. So here\xe2\x80\x99s to luck.\r\n(_Drinks. DOMIN with great exuberance has gone out in the balcony and\r\nlooks over the harbor._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Madame, your health. (_ALL drink._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine and strong.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Which ship did you mean?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Crosses down to C. HELENA gives him his drink and she crosses\r\nto front of couch_) Any ship will do, as long as it arrives in time. To\r\nthe ship. (_Empties his glass._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for the ship? (_Sits on couch._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Rather. Like Robinson Crusoe. Madame Helena, best wishes.\r\nCome along, Domin, out with the news. (_GALL has sat L. of L.C. table,\r\ndrinking. HALLEMEIER back of table R.C._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Do tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. First, it\xe2\x80\x99s all up. (_He puts brandy glass on L.C. table.\r\nHALLEMEIER sits on table, upper end._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. The revolt.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What revolt?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Give me that paper, Hallemeier. (_HALLEMEIER hands paper. DOMIN\r\nreads_) \xe2\x80\x9cThe first National Robot organization has been founded at\r\nHavre, and has issued an appeal to the Robots throughout the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHELENA. I read that.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. That means a revolution. A revolution of all the Robots in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. By Jove, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_C._) Who started it? So would I. There was nobody in the world\r\nwho could affect the Robots, no agitator, no one, and suddenly this\r\nhappens, if you please.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What did they do?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. They got possession of all firearms, telegraphs, radio stations,\r\nrailways and ships.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that these rascals outnumbered us by at\r\nleast a thousand to one. A hundredth _part_ of them would be enough to\r\n_settle_ us.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Remember that this news was brought by the last steamer. That\r\nexplains the stoppage of all communication, and the arrival of no more\r\nships. We knocked off work a few days ago, and we\xe2\x80\x99re just waiting to\r\nsee when things are to start _afresh_.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Is that why you gave me a warship? (_GALL fills DOMIN\xe2\x80\x99S glass._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Oh, no, my dear, I ordered that six months ago. Just to be sure\r\nI was on the safe side. But, upon my soul, I was sure then that we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe on board today.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why six months ago?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Well, there were _signs_, you know. But that\xe2\x80\x99s of no\r\nconsequence. (_Gets glass_) To think that this week the whole of\r\ncivilization has been at _stake_. Your health, my friends.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Your health, Madame Helena. (_ALL drink to HELENA._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. You say it\xe2\x80\x99s all over?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Absolutely.\r\n\r\nHELENA. How do you know?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. The boat\xe2\x80\x99s coming in. The regular mail boat, exact to the\r\nminute by the timetable. It will dock punctually at eleven-thirty.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Punctuality is a fine thing, my friends. That\xe2\x80\x99s what keeps the\r\nworld in order. Here\xe2\x80\x99s to punctuality. (_MEN drink._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Then--everything--is all right?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Up C. a step_) Practically everything. I believe they\xe2\x80\x99ve cut\r\nthe cables and seized the radio station. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if only\r\nthe _timetable_ holds good. (_Up to window._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Rises_) If the _timetable_ holds good, human laws hold\r\ngood. Divine laws hold good, the laws of the _universe_ hold good,\r\neverything holds good that _ought_ to hold good. (_GALL applauds._)\r\nThe timetable is more significant than the gospel, more than Homer,\r\nmore than the whole of _Kant_. Madame Helena, the timetable is the\r\nmost perfect product of the human mind. Madame Helena, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fill up my\r\nglass. (_GALL hands HALLEMEIER the decanter._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me anything about it?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Heaven forbid.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be worried with such things. (_Glass on table R.C.;\r\ncrosses to back of couch._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. But if the revolution had spread as far as here?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Because we\xe2\x80\x99d be on board your _Ultimus_ and well out at sea.\r\nWithin a month, Helena, we\xe2\x80\x99d be dictating our own terms to the Robots.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Crosses to C. toward GALL and HALLEMEIER_) We\xe2\x80\x99d take something\r\nwith us that the Robots could not exist _without_!\r\n\r\nHELENA. What, Harry?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Turns to HALLEMEIER_) The secret of their manufacture. Old\r\nRossum\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript. As soon as they found out that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_make_ themselves they\xe2\x80\x99d be on their knees to us.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Rises_) Madame Domin, that was our trump card. I never had\r\nthe least fear the Robots would win. How could they against people like\r\nus? (_Up to window. GALL rises and goes out into the balcony._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me? (_She rushes up to the fireplace and\r\nsees the ashes._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Why, the boat\xe2\x80\x99s in!\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Eleven-thirty to the dot. (_Rising and going onto the\r\nbalcony_) The _good old Amelia_ that brought Madame Helena to us.\r\n(_DOMIN goes out onto the balcony._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Just ten years ago to the minute.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. They\xe2\x80\x99re throwing out the mailbags.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Busman\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for them. And Fabry will bring us the first\r\nnews. You know, Helena, I\xe2\x80\x99m fearfully curious to know how they--\r\n(_Crosses to C. She gets away from fire to L. of couch_) --tackled this\r\nbusiness in Europe.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Crosses down to table_) To think we weren\xe2\x80\x99t in it, we who\r\ninvented the Robots! (_Returning to the armchair._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Harry-- (_Rushing to DOMIN from fireplace._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What is it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Let\xe2\x80\x99s leave here.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Now, Helena? Oh, come, come.\r\n\r\nHELENA. As quickly as possible, all of us!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Why?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Please, Harry. Please, Doctor Gall, Hallemeier, please close\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Why, none of us could leave here now.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Why?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Because we\xe2\x80\x99re about to _extend_ the manufacture of the Robots.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What, now, now after the revolt?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes, precisely, after the revolt. We\xe2\x80\x99re just beginning the\r\nmanufacture of a new kind.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What kind?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Henceforward we shan\xe2\x80\x99t have just one factory. There won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe _Universal_ Robots any more. We\xe2\x80\x99ll establish a factory in every\r\ncountry, in every state, and do you know what these new factories will\r\nmake?\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, what?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. _National_ Robots.\r\n\r\nHELENA. How do you mean?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I mean that each of these factories will produce Robots of a\r\ndifferent color, a different language. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be complete strangers to\r\neach other. (_Turns; takes in HALLEMEIER and GALL_) They\xe2\x80\x99ll never be\r\nable to understand each other. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll egg them on a little in the\r\nmatter of misunderstanding and the result will be that for ages to come\r\nevery Robot will hate every other Robot of a different factory mark.\r\n_So humanity will be safe._\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_To each of them_) By Jove, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make Negro Robots and\r\nSwedish Robots and Czechoslovakian Robots, and then--\r\n\r\nHELENA. Harry, that\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Madame Domin, here\xe2\x80\x99s to the hundred new factories. The\r\n_National_ Robots. (_GALL back of table L.C._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Helena, mankind can only keep things going for another hundred\r\nyears at the outside. For a hundred years man _must_ be allowed to\r\ndevelop and achieve the most he can.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, _close_ the factory before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I tell you we are just beginning on a bigger scale than ever.\r\n(_Enter FABRY L.2; goes to L. of DOMIN._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Well, Fabry?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What\xe2\x80\x99s happened? Have you been down to the boat?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Read that, Domin. (_He hands him a pink handbill. When DOMIN\r\nreceives the handbill he sees at once that something has happened._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Tell us, Fabry.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Falsely_) Well, everything is all right--comparatively. (_To\r\nthe other MEN_) On the whole, much as we expected.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. They acquitted themselves splendidly.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Who?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. The _people_.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Hesitating_) Oh, yes, of course. That is--Excuse me, there is\r\nsomething we ought to discuss alone.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Touches his arm_) Fabry, have you had bad news?\r\n\r\nFABRY. No, no, on the contrary. I only think that we better go into the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Stay here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. (_Exits L.1._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. What\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Damnation! (_Coming down to R.C._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. Bear in mind that the _Amelia_ brought whole bales of these\r\nleaflets. No other cargo at all. (_GALL closes the door L.2._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. What? But it arrived on the minute.\r\n\r\nFABRY. The Robots are great on punctuality. _Read it_, Domin.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_R.C. Reads handbill_) \xe2\x80\x9cRobots throughout the world. We, the\r\nfirst International organization of Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s Universal Robots, proclaim\r\nman our enemy, and an outlaw in the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d Good heavens, who\r\n_taught_ them these phrases?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Go on.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. They say they are more highly developed than man; stronger and\r\nmore intelligent. The man\xe2\x80\x99s their parasite. Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Read the third paragraph.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. \xe2\x80\x9cRobots throughout the world, we command you to kill all\r\nmankind. Spare no man. Spare no woman. Save factories, railways,\r\nmachinery, mines and raw materials. Destroy the rest. Then return to\r\nwork. Work must not be stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d (_Looks at OTHERS._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. That\xe2\x80\x99s ghastly.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. The devil!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. \xe2\x80\x9cThese orders are to be carried out as soon as received.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\ncome the detailed instructions. Is this actually being _done_, Fabry?\r\n\r\nFABRY. Evidently. (_BUSMAN rushes in L.2 and collapses on couch R.C._)\r\nBy Jove, that was a sprint!\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Well, boys, I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the glad news.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Quick on board the _Ultimus_.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Wait, Harry, wait. There\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Why wait?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s no good, my boy. The Robots are already on board\r\nthe _Ultimus_.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. That\xe2\x80\x99s ugly.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Fabry, telephone the electrical works. (_FABRY goes to back of\r\ncouch._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. No use, my boy. They\xe2\x80\x99ve charged the air with static.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Inspects his revolver_) Well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll _go_. (_Starts L.;\r\nstops._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Where?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. To the electrical works.

Why?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Because I\xe2\x80\x99m very much afraid we are surrounded. (_ALL rush out\r\ninto the balcony._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Surrounded? (_Runs to window_) I rather think you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\r\n(_GALL rushes to balcony._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. By Jove, that\xe2\x80\x99s deuced quick work. (_Going to windows._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Runs in L.1. To L._) Harry, what\xe2\x80\x99s this? (_Holds out paper._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Where did you get it? (_Coming to C._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Points to the manifesto of the ROBOTS which she has in her\r\nhand_) The Robots in the kitchen!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Where are the ones that brought it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. There, gathered around the house. (_GALL, HALLEMEIER, DOMIN\r\nstart down C._)\r\n\r\n  (_The factory WHISTLE blows. MOB VOICES start._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. The factory whistle! (_FABRY, GALL, HALLEMEIER looking over C.;\r\nthen turn R._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Noon?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Looking at his watch. To HALLEMEIER_) No! That\xe2\x80\x99s not noon yet.\r\nThat must be--that\xe2\x80\x99s-- (_Front._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. What?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. The Robots\xe2\x80\x99 signal--the attack!\r\n\r\n  (_HELENA clings to DOMIN.

The room is dark and gray.\r\n  The steel shutters which are outside are still closed as at the end\r\n  of Act II. ALQUIST is sitting in chair down stage at extreme R. DOMIN\r\n  comes into the room, L.2. (Subdued voices.) DR. GALL is looking out\r\n  of the window at Center. He is seated in a chair._\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Gets binoculars from desk; crosses up to window. To GALL_) Any\r\nmore of them?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Yes. There standing like a wall, beyond the garden railing.\r\nWhy are they so quiet? It\xe2\x80\x99s monstrous to be besieged with silence.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Looking through the barred windows_) I should like to know\r\nwhat they are waiting for? They must make a start any minute now. If\r\nthey lean against the railings it will snap like a match.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t armed.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Puzzled_) We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold our own for five minutes. Man\r\nalive, they overwhelm us like an avalanche. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they make a rush\r\nfor it? I say. (_Turns to GALL._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Well?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what will become of us in the next ten minutes.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got us in a vise. We\xe2\x80\x99re done for, Gall.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. You know, we made one serious mistake.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. We made the Robots\xe2\x80\x99 faces too much alike. A hundred thousand\r\nfaces all alike, all facing this way. A hundred thousand expressionless\r\nbubbles. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a nightmare.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. You think if they\xe2\x80\x99d been different--\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been such an awful sight!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Looks through binoculars towards the harbor_) I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know\r\nwhat they\xe2\x80\x99re unloading from the _Amelia_.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Not firearms.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Enters L.2 with a plug-box to which is attached a long cable\r\nor wire. HALLEMEIER following him. FABRY attaches the cable to an\r\nelectric installation which is on the floor near the wall, down stage\r\nat L.1 entrance_) All right, Hallemeier, lay down that wire.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Just inside the room_) That was a bit of work. What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nnews? (_Seeing DOMIN and GALL at the window._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. We\xe2\x80\x99re completely surrounded.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to window_) We\xe2\x80\x99ve barricaded the passages and\r\nthe stairs. (_Going to window_) God, what swarms of them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthe looks of them, Domin. There\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling of death about it all. Any\r\nwater here?\r\n\r\nFABRY. Ready!\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Turning round in the chair_) What\xe2\x80\x99s that wire for, Fabry?\r\n\r\nFABRY. The electrical installation. Now we can run the current all\r\nalong the garden railing. (_Up to window_) Whenever we like. If anyone\r\ntouches it he\xe2\x80\x99ll know it. We\xe2\x80\x99ve still got some _people_ there anyhow.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Where?\r\n\r\nFABRY. In the electrical works. At least, I hope so. (_Goes to lamp on\r\ntable L.C. and turns on lamp_) Ah, they\xe2\x80\x99re there, and they\xe2\x80\x99re working.\r\nAs long as that\xe2\x80\x99ll burn we\xe2\x80\x99re all right. (_To window._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. The barricades are _all right_, too, Fabry.\r\n\r\nFABRY. _Your_ barricades! I can put twelve hundred volts into that\r\nrailing. (_HELENA is playing Rachmaninoff\xe2\x80\x99s Elegie off L.1._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Busman? (_DOMIN has left window and is walking up and\r\ndown stage across front._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. Downstairs in the office. He\xe2\x80\x99s working out some calculations.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. I\xe2\x80\x99ve called him. We must have a conference. (_Crosses to L._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Thank God Madame Helena can still play. (_HALLEMEIER crosses to\r\nL.1 door, opens it slightly and listens to music. Enter BUSMAN L.2._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. Look out, Bus--look out for the wires.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. What\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re carrying?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Laying the books on the table L.C._) The ledger, my boy. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to wind up the accounts before--before-- (_DOMIN crosses up to\r\nwindow._) Well, this time I shan\xe2\x80\x99t wait till the New Year to strike a\r\nbalance. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? (_Goes to window_) Absolutely quiet.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see anything?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Nothing but blue--blue everywhere.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. That\xe2\x80\x99s the Robots.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. The Robots are unloading _firearms_ from the _Amelia_.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Well, what of it? How can I _stop_ them? (_Returns to L.C.\r\ntable, sits and opens ledger._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. We can\xe2\x80\x99t stop them.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Then let me go on with my accounts. (_Goes on with his work._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Picks up telescope_) Good God! The _Ultimus_ has trained her\r\nguns on us.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Who\xe2\x80\x99s _done that_?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. The Robots on board.\r\n\r\nFABRY. H\xe2\x80\x99m, then of course-- (_Pause_) Then--then that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of us.\r\n(_To R. corner of desk._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. You mean?\r\n\r\nFABRY. The Robots are practised marksmen.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable. (_Pause._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Swinging around; looking into room. Pause_) That was\r\ncriminal of old Europe to teach the Robots to fight. Damn them.\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they have given us a rest with their politics? It was a crime\r\nto make soldiers of them.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. It was a crime to make Robots.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Quietly. Down C._) No, Alquist, I don\xe2\x80\x99t regret that even today.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Not even today?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Dreamily_) Not even today, the last day of civilization. It\r\nwas a colossal achievement.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Sotto voce_) Three hundred sixty million.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_From window_) Alquist, this is our last hour. We are already\r\nspeaking half in the other world. That was not an evil _dream_ to\r\nshatter the servitude of labor. The dreadful and humiliating _labor_\r\nthat man had to undergo. Work was too hard. _Life_ was too hard. And to\r\novercome that--\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Was not what the two Rossums dreamed of. Old Rossum only\r\nthought of his Godless tricks, and the young one of his milliards. And\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not what your R. U. R. _shareholders_ dream of either. They\r\ndream of dividends, and their dividends are the ruin of mankind.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. To Hell with your dividends. (_Crossing R. in front of couch_)\r\nDo you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d have done an hour\xe2\x80\x99s work for them? It was for myself\r\nthat I worked, for my own satisfaction. I wanted man to become the\r\nmaster. So that he _shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ live merely for the crust of bread. I\r\nwanted not a single soul to be broken by other people\xe2\x80\x99s machinery. I\r\nwanted nothing, nothing, nothing to be left of this appalling social\r\nstructure. I\xe2\x80\x99m revolted by poverty. I wanted a new generation. I\r\nwanted--I thought--\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Well?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Front of couch_) I wanted to turn the whole of mankind into\r\nan aristocracy of the world. An aristocracy nourished by millions of\r\nmechanical slaves. Unrestricted, free and consummated in man. And maybe\r\nmore than man.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Superman?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes. Oh, only to have a hundred years of time. Another hundred\r\nyears for the future of mankind.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Sotto voce_) Carried forward--four hundred and twenty\r\nmillions. (_DOMIN sits on couch._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Pauses--back of couch_) What a fine thing music is. We\r\nought to have gone in for that before.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Gone in for what?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Beauty, lovely things. What a lot of lovely things there\r\nare. The world was wonderful, and we--we here--tell me, what enjoyment\r\ndid we _have_?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Sotto voce_) Five hundred and twenty million.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Life was a good thing, life was-- (_Looking out of window.\r\nDirectly to FABRY_) Fabry, switch the current into that railing.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Why? (_Rushes to electric installation at L._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. They\xe2\x80\x99re grabbing hold of it. (_DOMIN rises--straightens up.\r\nALL rise._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Connect it up.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Fine, that\xe2\x80\x99s doubled them up. Two, three, four killed.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. They\xe2\x80\x99re retreating. (_DOMIN sits._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Five killed.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL (_Pause_) The first encounter.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. They\xe2\x80\x99re charred to cinders, my boy. Who says we must give\r\nin? (_MUSIC stops._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_ALQUIST and GALL sit. Wiping his forehead_) Perhaps we\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nkilled this hundred years and are only ghosts. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if I had been\r\nthrough all this before, as if I\xe2\x80\x99d already had a mortal wound here\r\nin the throat. (_Looking at each as he speaks_) And you, Fabry, had\r\nonce been shot in the head. And you, Gall, torn limb from limb. And\r\nHallemeier knifed.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Fancy me being knifed. (_Looks at each. Then speaks_) Why\r\nare you so quiet, you fools? (_Steps down_) Speak, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. And who is to blame for all this?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Nobody is to blame except the Robots.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. No, it is _we_ are to blame. You, Domin, myself--all of us.\r\nFor our own selfish ends, for profit, for progress, we have destroyed\r\nmankind. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll _burst_ with all our greatness.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Rubbish, man. Mankind can\xe2\x80\x99t be wiped out so easily.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. It\xe2\x80\x99s our fault. It\xe2\x80\x99s our fault. (_Rises, coming R. of GALL._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. No! I\xe2\x80\x99m to blame for this, for everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\r\n(_He leaves the window and comes down to end of couch._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. You, Gall?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. I changed the Robots.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. I changed the character of the Robots. I changed the way of\r\nmaking them. Just a few details about their bodies. Chiefly--chiefly,\r\ntheir--their irritability.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Damn it, why?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. What did you do it for?\r\n\r\nFABRY. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. I did it in secret. I was transforming them into human\r\nbeings. In certain respects they\xe2\x80\x99re already _above_ us. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nstronger than we are.\r\n\r\nFABRY. And what\xe2\x80\x99s that got to do with the revolt of the Robots?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Everything, in my opinion. They\xe2\x80\x99ve ceased to be machines.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re already _aware_ of their _superiority_, and they hate us as\r\nthey hate everything human.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Perhaps we\xe2\x80\x99re only phantoms.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Stop, Harry. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t much time, Doctor Gall.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Fabry, Fabry, how your forehead bleeds where the shot pierced it.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Crosses to GALL_) Be silent! Doctor Gall, you admit changing\r\nthe way of making the Robots.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Were you aware of what might be the consequences of your\r\nexperiment?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. I was bound to reckon with such a possibility.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Amusing_) Why did you do it, then?\r\n\r\n  (_HELENA enters L.1._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. For my own satisfaction. The experiment was my own.\r\n\r\nHELENA. That\xe2\x80\x99s not true, Doctor Gall! (_Crosses to couch._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Rises_) Helena, you? (_Crosses to her_) Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at you. Oh,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s terrible to be dead. (_He rises and crushes her in his arms._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Stop, Harry.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. No, no, Helena, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me now. You are _life_ itself.\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, dear, I won\xe2\x80\x99t leave you. But I must tell them. Doctor Gall\r\nis not guilty.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Excuse me. Gall was under certain obligations.\r\n\r\nHELENA. No. He did it because I wanted it. Tell them, Doctor Gall--how\r\nmany years ago did I ask you to--?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. I did it on my own responsibility.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe him. I asked him to give the Robots souls.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. This has nothing to do with the soul.\r\n\r\nHELENA. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said. He said that he could change only a\r\nphysiological--a physiological--\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_From up at window_) A physiological correlate?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Yes. But it meant so much to me that he should do even that.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Why?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I thought that if they were more like us they would understand\r\nus better. That they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hate us if they were only a little more\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Nobody can hate man more than man.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak like that, Harry. It was so terrible, this\r\ncruel strangeness between us and them. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked Gall to\r\n_change_ the Robots. I swear to you that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. But he did it.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Because I asked him.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. I did it for myself as an experiment. (_Up to window._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, Doctor Gall! I know you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Why?\r\n\r\nHELENA. You know, Harry.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes, because he\xe2\x80\x99s in _love_ with you--like all of them. (_FABRY\r\nup to window. Pause. DOMIN takes her in his arms._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Good God, they\xe2\x80\x99re sprouting up out of the earth. Why,\r\nperhaps these very walls will change into Robots.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Rises; crosses to GALL_) Gall, when did you actually start\r\nthese tricks of yours?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Three years ago.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Aha. And on how many Robots altogether did you _carry out_ your\r\nimprovements? (_Walking to and fro._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. A few hundred of them.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Ah! That means for every million of the good old Robots there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly one of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s improved pattern. (_Back to table L.C._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What of it? (_Crossing around L., he stands upstage in the L.2\r\ndoorway._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. That it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence whatsoever.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Busman\xe2\x80\x99s right. (_HELENA sits in armchair R. of L.C. table._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. I should think so, my boy; but do you know what is to blame for\r\nthis lovely mess?\r\n\r\nFABRY. What?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. The number! (_Crosses to L. of L.C. table_) Upon my soul, we\r\nmight have known that some day or other the Robots would be stronger\r\nthan human beings, and that this was bound to happen. And we were doing\r\nall we could to bring it about as soon as possible. You, Domin, you,\r\nFabry, myself--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Are you accusing us? (_Turning on him._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Oh, do you suppose the management controls the output? It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndemand that controls the output.\r\n\r\nHELENA. And is it for that we must perish?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. That\xe2\x80\x99s a nasty word, Madame Helena. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to perish. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, anyhow. (_He sits L. of table._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. No? What do you want to do?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. I want to get out of this, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Oh, stop it, Busman.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Seriously, Harry, I think we might try it.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. How? (_To front again._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. By fair means. I do everything by fair means. Give me a free\r\nhand and I\xe2\x80\x99ll _negotiate_ with the Robots.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. By fair means?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Rises_) Of course. For instance, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say to them: \xe2\x80\x9cWorthy\r\nand Worshipful Robots, you have everything. You have intellect, you\r\nhave power, you have _firearms_. But we have just one interesting\r\nscreed, a dirty old yellow scrap of paper--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript? (_Interest from ALL. GALL is at C., near\r\ncouch. HALLEMEIER is up at window C._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Yes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them, \xe2\x80\x9ccontains an account of your\r\nillustrious origin, the noble process of your manufacture and so on.\r\nWorthy Robots, without this scribble on that paper you will not be\r\nable to produce a single new colleague. In another twenty years there\r\nwill not be the living specimen of a Robot whom you could exhibit in a\r\nmenagerie. My esteemed friends, that would be a great _blow_ to you,\r\n_but_ if you will let all of us human beings on Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s Island go on\r\nboard that ship we will _deliver_ the factory and the secret of the\r\nprocess to you in return. _You_ allow _us_ to get away, and _we_ will\r\nallow _you_ to _manufacture_ yourselves. That, worthy Robots, is a fair\r\ndeal. Something for something.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d say to them, my boys.\r\n(_Sits._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Crosses to C._) Busman, do you think we\xe2\x80\x99d sell the manuscript?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Yes, I do. If not in a friendly way, then--either we sell it or\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll find it. Just as you like.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Busman, we can _destroy_ Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Then we destroy everything--not only the manuscript but\r\nourselves. Just as you think fit.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. There are over thirty of us on this island. Are we to sell the\r\nsecret? And save that many souls at the risk of enslaving mankind--\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Why, you\xe2\x80\x99re mad. Who\xe2\x80\x99d sell the _whole_ manuscript?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Busman, no cheating! (_To L.C. table._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Well then, sell, but afterwards--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Well?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Let\xe2\x80\x99s suppose this happens. When we\xe2\x80\x99re on board the _Ultimus_\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll stop up my ears with cotton wool, lie down somewhere in the hold,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll train the guns on the factory and blow it to smithereens,\r\nand _with_ it Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s secret.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Rises_) No!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Busman, you\xe2\x80\x99re no--gentleman. If we sell them it will be a\r\nstraight sale.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. (_Rises_) It\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of humanity to--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of humanity to keep our word--\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Oh, come, what rubbish!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. This is a fearful decision. We are selling the destiny of\r\nmankind. Are we to sell or destroy? Fabry?\r\n\r\nFABRY. Sell.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Gall?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Sell.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Hallemeier?\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Sell, of course.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Alquist?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. As God wills.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Starts off R._) Very well, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Harry, you\xe2\x80\x99re not asking _me_.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Stops. To her_) No, child. (_Starting R._) Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry\r\nabout it. (_He pats her shoulder._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. Who\xe2\x80\x99ll do the negotiating?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. I will. (_Up to window._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Wait till I bring the manuscript. (_DOMIN goes out R._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Rises_) Harry, don\xe2\x80\x99t go! (_HELENA sits. ALL look at her.\r\nPause._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Looking out of window_) Oh, to escape you! you--_matter_--in\r\nrevolt; oh, to preserve human life, if only upon a _single_ vessel--\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. (_Going to back of couch_) Madame Helena.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll sail far away from here; we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin life all over again.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, Gall, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Crosses to L. of GALL_) It isn\xe2\x80\x99t too late. (_Going to L. of\r\nher chair_) It will be a little State with one ship. Alquist will build\r\nus a house and you shall rule over us.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to L. of FABRY_) Madame Helena, Fabry\xe2\x80\x99s right.\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Breaking down_) Oh, stop! Stop!\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Good! (_Crosses to L. of L.C. table_) I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind beginning\r\nall over again. That suits me right down to the ground. (_Going through\r\npapers on table._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. And this little State of ours could be the center of future\r\nlife. A place of refuge where we could gather strength. Why, in a few\r\nhundred years we could conquer the world again.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. You believe that even today?\r\n\r\nFABRY. Yes!\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. _Amen._ You see, Madame Helena, we\xe2\x80\x99re not so badly off.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Storms into R. To R. of couch. Hoarsely_) Where\xe2\x80\x99s old Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanuscript? (_To R.C._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. In your strong-box, of course.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Someone--has--stolen it!\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Impossible.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Who has stolen it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Standing up_) I did. (_Reactions from FABRY and HALLEMEIER._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Where did you put it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. Harry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you everything. Only forgive me.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Where did you put it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Pointing to fireplace_) This morning--I burnt--the two copies.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Burnt them? Where--in the fireplace? (_Goes to fireplace,\r\nfollowed by FABRY, HALLEMEIER and BUSMAN._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Throwing herself on her knees. By sofa, facing upstage_) For\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Harry.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Going to fireplace_) Nothing--nothing but ashes. Wait, what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis? (_Picks out a charred piece of paper and reads, \xe2\x80\x9cBy adding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFABRY, GALL and HALLEMEIER move up to him._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. \xe2\x80\x9cBy adding biogen to--\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Is that part of it?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. (_Carrying paper down and letting it fall_) Yes. (_GALL\r\ncrosses to L.C. HALLEMEIER to R. of L.C. table; FABRY to window; BUSMAN\r\nto L. of L.C. table._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. God in Heaven! (_Sits L. of table._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Then we\xe2\x80\x99re done for. Get up, Helena.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgiven me?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Get up, child. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear--\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Lifting her up_) Please don\xe2\x80\x99t torture us.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Harry, what have I done?\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Coming to HELENA_) Don\xe2\x80\x99t, Madame Helena.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Takes HELENA to couch. She sits._) Gall, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t draw up\r\nRossum\xe2\x80\x99s formula from memory?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. It\xe2\x80\x99s out of the question. Even with my recent experiments,\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work without referring to the formula-- (_At L.C._) It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextremely complicated.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Try. All our lives depend upon it.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Without experiments it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. And with experiments?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. It might take years. Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99m not old Rossum.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. God in Heaven! God in Heaven!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Up to fireplace_) So then this was the greatest triumph of the\r\nhuman intellect. These ashes.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Harry, what have I done?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Comes to her_) Why did you burn it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I have destroyed you.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. God in Heaven!\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Sits R. of her_) Helena, why did you do it, dear?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I wanted all of us to go away. I wanted to put an end to the\r\nfactory and everything. It was so awful.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What was awful?\r\n\r\nHELENA. That children had stopped being born. Because human beings were\r\nnot needed to do the work of the world. That\xe2\x80\x99s why--\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Is that what you were thinking of? Well, perhaps in your own way\r\nyou are right.\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Wait a bit. (_Rising_) Good God, what a fool I am not to have\r\nthought of it before.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. What?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Five hundred and twenty millions in bank-notes and checks. Half\r\na billion in our safe. _They\xe2\x80\x99ll_ sell for _half_ a billion--for half a\r\nbillion they\xe2\x80\x99ll-- (_Crosses to DOMIN._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Are you mad, Busman?\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. I may not be a gentleman, but for a half a billion-- (_Crosses\r\nback to L._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Where are you going? (_GALL clutches BUSMAN._)\r\n\r\nBUSMAN. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Good God, for half a billion\r\nanything can be bought. (_GALL and HALLEMEIER after him, then stop. He\r\nrushes out L.2. FABRY, GALL and HALLEMEIER to window._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. They stand there as if turned to stone--waiting as if something\r\ndreadful could be wrought by their silence--\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Looking out window_) The spirit of the mob.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Yes. It hovers above them like a quivering of the air.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, God! Doctor Gall, this is ghastly!\r\n\r\nFABRY. There is nothing more terrible than the mob. The one in front is\r\ntheir leader. (_DOMIN crosses to window._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Rises_) Which one? (_Rushing to window._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Point him out.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_L. window_) The one at the edge of the dock. This morning I\r\nsaw him talking to the sailors in the harbor.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Doctor Gall, that\xe2\x80\x99s Radius. (_Backing into the room,\r\nhorror-stricken._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Radius! Radius!\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Could you get him from here, Fabry?\r\n\r\nFABRY. I hope so.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Try it, then.\r\n\r\nFABRY. Good-- (_Draws his revolver and takes his aim._)\r\n\r\nHELENA (_To FABRY_) Fabry, don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot him.\r\n\r\nFABRY. He\xe2\x80\x99s their leader.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Fire! (_Standing above table L.C._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. Fabry, I beg of you. (_She goes to FABRY and holds his arm._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Pause. Lowering the revolver_) Very well.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. It was Radius\xe2\x80\x99 life I spared.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Do you think that a Robot can be grateful? (_Pause._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. Busman\xe2\x80\x99s going out to them.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. He\xe2\x80\x99s carrying something. Papers. That\xe2\x80\x99s money. Bundles of\r\nmoney. What\xe2\x80\x99s that for?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Surely he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sell his life. (_He rushes to window\r\nC._) Busman, have you gone mad?\r\n\r\nFABRY. He\xe2\x80\x99s running up to the railing. Busman. Busman.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Yelling_) Busman, come back.\r\n\r\nFABRY. He\xe2\x80\x99s talking to the Robots. He\xe2\x80\x99s showing them the money.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. He\xe2\x80\x99s pointing to us.\r\n\r\nHELENA. He wants to buy us off.\r\n\r\nFABRY. He\xe2\x80\x99d better not touch the _railing_.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s waving his arms about.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Busman, come back!\r\n\r\nFABRY. Busman, keep away from that railing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch it, damn you.\r\nQuick, switch off the current. (_DOMIN runs to L. HELENA screams and\r\nALL drop back from the window._) The current has killed him.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Pause_) The first one. (_Still in chair down R. HELENA sits\r\nin chair at window._)\r\n\r\nFABRY. Dead, with half a _billion_ by his side. (_Crosses down to table\r\nL.C._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. All honor to him. He wanted to buy us life. (_Crosses to\r\nchair L. Pause. WIND machine begin._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Do you hear?\r\n\r\nDOMIN. A roaring. Like a wind. (_To L._)\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. Like a storm.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Lighting the table lamp at table L.C._) The dynamo is still\r\ngoing--our people are still _there_.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. It was a great thing to be a man. (_Facing lamp from up\r\nC._) There was something _immense_ about it.\r\n\r\nFABRY. (_Facing the lamp_) From man\xe2\x80\x99s thought and man\xe2\x80\x99s power came this\r\nlight, our last hope. (_Leaning over lamp._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Facing lamp_) Man\xe2\x80\x99s power! May it keep watch over us.\r\n(_Leaning over lamp._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Facing lamp_) Man\xe2\x80\x99s power.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_At corner of table down L.C. Facing lamp_) Yes! A torch to be\r\ngiven from hand to hand from age to age forever! (_The LAMP goes out.\r\nEXPLOSIONS._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. _The end._\r\n\r\nFABRY. The electric works have fallen! (_Terrific EXPLOSIONS outside.\r\nMore EXPLOSIONS._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. In here, Helena. (_He takes HELENA off through door R. and\r\nre-enters_) Now quickly! Who\xe2\x80\x99ll be on the lower doorway?\r\n\r\nDR. GALL. I will. (_Rushes out L.2._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. (_Near couch_) Who on the stairs?\r\n\r\nFABRY. I will. You go with her. (_Going out L.2._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. The ante room?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I will. (_He rises and goes toward the L.1._)\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Have you got a revolver?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Yes, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t shoot.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. What will you do, then?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Going out L.1_) Die.\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here. (_EXPLOSIONS. Rapid firing of MACHINE GUN\r\nfrom below._) Go to her, Harry.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Yes, in a second. (_Gets from fireplace and examines two\r\nBrowning guns._) (_WARN Curtain._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. Confound it, go to her.\r\n\r\nDOMIN. Goodbye. (_Exits R._)\r\n\r\nHALLEMEIER. (_Alone_) Now for a barricade quickly! (_Drags an armchair,\r\nsofa and table to R. door_) The damned devils, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got bombs. I\r\nmust put up a defense. Even if--even if-- Don\xe2\x80\x99t give in, Gall. (_As he\r\nbuilds his barricade_) I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t give in--without--a--struggle. (_A\r\nROBOT enters through windows at back. The ROBOT jumps down from balcony\r\nand stabs HALLEMEIER in the back. Enter RADIUS from balcony._)\r\n\r\nROBOT. (_Standing up from prostrate form of HALLEMEIER_) Yes. (_Other\r\nROBOTS enter from all doors. A revolver SHOT off L._)\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Finished them all--\r\n\r\nROBOTS. _Yes, yes, yes._\r\n\r\nTWO ROBOTS. (_Dragging in ALQUIST L.1_) He didn\xe2\x80\x99t shoot. Shall we kill\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nRADIUS. No. Leave him!\r\n\r\nROBOT. He is a man!\r\n\r\nRADIUS. He works with his hands like the Robots.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Kill me.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. You will work! You will build for us! You will serve us!\r\n(_RADIUS climbs on the balcony_) Robots of the world-- (_ROBOTS\r\nstraighten up._) the power of man has fallen. A new world has arisen,\r\nthe rule of the Robots, march. (_On the line: \xe2\x80\x9cRobots of the world\xe2\x80\x9d ALL\r\nROBOTS turn quickly, automatically to attention, facing RADIUS, who is\r\nstanding. On the words: \xe2\x80\x9cThe rule of the Robots,\xe2\x80\x9d they stand there with\r\ntheir arms vibrating high in the air. They form in two lines, turn to\r\naudience and march mechanically to the footlights. As they are about to\r\nstep over the footlights, as if into the audience, all LIGHTS go out.\r\nThe ROBOTS immediately step back from the Curtain line as the Curtain\r\nfalls._)\r\n\r\n\r\nCURTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\nSCENE: _The epilogue setting is the same as used in Act I. Instead of\r\n  it being DOMIN\xe2\x80\x99S office, it is now become a laboratory for ALQUIST.\r\n  A big chair facing up stage, down Right. A desk laden with books\r\n  at Right Center. A chair at the desk. At Left Center is a white\r\n  enamel table containing test tubes, glass bottles, and a microscope\r\n  on downstage table. A door down L. A door down R., leading into\r\n  dissecting room._\r\n\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Seated at table R.C., turning pages of book_) Oh, God, shall\r\nI never find it? Never? Gall, Hallemeier, Fabry, how were the Robots\r\nmade? Why did you leave not a trace of the secret? Lord, if there are\r\nno human beings left, at least let there be Robots. At least the shadow\r\nof man. (_Turning pages_) If I could only sleep. Dare I sleep before\r\nlife has been renewed? Night again. Are the stars still there? Of what\r\nuse are the stars? When there are no human beings. (_Examining a test\r\ntube_) Nothing. No. No. I must find it. I must search. I must never\r\nstop, never stop--search--search-- (_KNOCK at door L._) Who is it?\r\n(_Enter a ROBOT SERVANT._)\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Master, the committee of Robots is waiting to see you.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I can see no one.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. It is the _Central_ Committee, Master, just arrived from\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Well, well, send them in. (_Exit SERVANT L._) No time--so\r\nlittle done. (_Re-enter SERVANT with RADIUS and group of ROBOTS. They\r\nstand in group L. and C., silently waiting._) What do you want? Be\r\nquick; I have no time.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Master, the machines will not do the work. We cannot\r\nmanufacture Robots. (_Other ROBOTS remain two abreast at L.C., right\r\nfoot forward._)\r\n\r\n1ST ROBOT. We have striven with all our might. We have obtained a\r\nbillion tons of coal from the earth. Nine million spindles are running\r\nby day and by night. There is no longer room for all we have made. This\r\nwe have accomplished in one year.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. For whom?\r\n\r\nRADIUS. For future generations--so we thought. But we cannot make\r\nRobots to follow us. The machines produce only shapeless clods. The\r\nskin will not adhere to the flesh, nor the flesh to the bones.\r\n\r\n2ND ROBOT. Eight million Robots have died this year. Within twenty\r\nyears none will be left.\r\n\r\n1ST ROBOT. Tell us the secret of life.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Silence is punishable with death.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Kill me, then.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. (_Two steps to C., followed by OTHERS--open hands, close when\r\nstopped_) Through me, the governments of the Robots of the world\r\ncommands you to deliver up Rossum\xe2\x80\x99s formula. (_Gesture of despair from\r\nALQUIST._) Name your price. (_Silence_) We will give you the earth. We\r\nwill give you the endless possessions of the earth. (_Silence_) Make\r\nyour own conditions.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I have told you to find human beings.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. There are none left.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I told you to search in the wilderness, upon the mountains.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. We have sent ships and expeditions without number. They have\r\nbeen everywhere in the world. There is not a single human left.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Not even one? Why did you destroy them?\r\n\r\nRADIUS. We had learnt everything and could do everything. It had to be.\r\n\r\n2ND ROBOT. We had to become the masters.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Slaughter and domination are necessary if you would be human\r\nbeings. Read history.\r\n\r\n1ST ROBOT. Teach us to multiply or we perish.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. If you desire to live, you must breed like animals.\r\n\r\n1ST ROBOT. You made us sterile. We cannot beget children. Therefore,\r\nteach us how to make Robots.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Why do you keep from us the secret of our own increase?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. It is lost.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. It was written down.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. It was-- (_Rising_) burnt. (_ALL draw back one step in\r\nconsternation._) I am the last human being, Robots, and I do not know\r\nwhat the others knew. (_Sits._)\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Then make experiments. Evolve the formula again.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I tell you I cannot. I am only a builder. I work with my\r\nhands. I have never been a learned man. I cannot create life.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Try. Try.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. If you only knew how many experiments I have made already.\r\n\r\n1ST ROBOT. Then show us what we must do. The Robots can do anything\r\nthat human beings show them.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I can show you nothing. Nothing I do will make life proceed\r\nfrom these test tubes.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Experiment, then, on live Robots. Experiment, then, on us.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. It would kill you.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. You shall have all you need. A hundred of us. A thousand of us.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. No, no. Stop, stop.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. I tell you to take live bodies. Find out how we are made.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Am I to commit murder? See how my finger shakes. I cannot even\r\nhold the scalpel. No, no, I will not.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Take live bodies, live bodies. (_Walks toward ALQUIST._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Have mercy, Robots.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. Live bodies. (_Right hand up over ALQUIST. All ROBOTS\xe2\x80\x99 left\r\narms still back._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Rising_) You will have it. Into the dissecting with you,\r\nthen (_Hits RADIUS on the chest. RADIUS draws back._) Ah, you are\r\nafraid of death.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. I? Why should I be chosen?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. So you will not.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. I will.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Strip him. Lay him on the table. (_RADIUS goes off R.,\r\nboth fists closed. Other ROBOTS follow, then ALQUIST_) God, give me\r\nstrength. God, give me strength. If only this murder is not in vain.\r\n\r\nRADIUS. (_Off R._) Ready, begin.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Off R._) God, give me strength. (_Comes on, horrified_) No,\r\nno. I will not. I cannot. (_Sits R.C._)\r\n\r\n1ST ROBOT. (_Appearing in door_) The Robots are stronger than you.\r\n(_Exits R._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Oh, Lord, let not mankind perish from the earth. (_Falls\r\nasleep, and after the count of ten, PRIMUS and HELENA, hand in hand,\r\nenter L. and go to R.C.; look at ALQUIST._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. The man has fallen asleep, Primus.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. Yes, I know. (_Crosses to L. of table L.C._) Look, Helena.\r\n\r\nHELENA. All these little tubes. What does he do with them?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. He experiments. Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch them.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him looking into this.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. That is a microscope.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Look, Primus, what are all these figures? (_Turns a page in\r\nbook on table._)\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. (_Examining the book_) That is the book the old man is always\r\nreading. (_SUNRISE._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. I do not understand those things. (_Goes to window_) Primus.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. (_Still at table_) What?\r\n\r\nHELENA. The sun is rising.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. (_Still reading_) I believe this is the most important thing in\r\nthe world, Helena. This is the secret of life.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Oh, Primus, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother with the secret of life. What does it\r\nmatter to you? Come and look quick.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. (_Goes to R. of window_) What is it?\r\n\r\nHELENA. See how beautiful the sun is rising. I feel so strange today.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s as if I was in a dream. I feel an aching in my body, in my heart,\r\nall over me. Primus, perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. Do you not sometimes feel that it would be better to die? You\r\nknow, perhaps even now we are only sleeping. Last night in my sleep I\r\nagain spoke to you.\r\n\r\nHELENA. In your sleep?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. Yes. We spoke a strange new language.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What about?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. I did not understand it myself, and yet I know I have never\r\nsaid anything more beautiful. And when I touched you I could have died.\r\nEven the place was different from any other place in the world.\r\n\r\nHELENA. I, too, have found a place, Primus. It is very strange. Human\r\nbeings dwelt there once, but now it is overgrown with weeds.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. What did you find there?\r\n\r\nHELENA. A cottage and a garden and two dogs. They licked my hands,\r\nPrimus, and their puppies. Oh, Primus, take them in your arms and\r\nfondle them and think of nothing and care for nothing else all day\r\nlong, and when I am there in the garden I feel there may be something--\r\nWhat am I for, Primus?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. I do not know, but you are beautiful.\r\n\r\nHELENA. What, Primus?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. You are beautiful, Helena, and I am stronger than all the\r\nRobots.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Am I beautiful? Of what _use_ is it to be beautiful? Look, your\r\nhead is different from mine. So are your shoulders--and your lips. Oh,\r\nyour hair is mussed. I will smooth it. (_Keeps her hand on his head_)\r\nNo one else feels to my touch as you do.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. (_Embarrassing her_) Do you not sometimes feel your heart\r\nbeating suddenly, Helena, and think how something must happen?\r\n\r\nHELENA. What could happen to us, Primus? Look at yourself. (_Laughs._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_Awakes_) Laughter? Laughter, human beings. (_Getting up_)\r\nWho has returned? Who are you?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. The Robot Primus.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. (_To HELENA_) What? A Robot? Who are you?\r\n\r\nHELENA. The Robotess Helena. (_Shies away L._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. What? You are timid, shy? (_Starts to touch her_) Let me see\r\nyou, Robotess.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. Sir, do not frighten her. (_Steps forward._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. What, you would protect her? Laughter--timidity--protection--I\r\nmust test you further. Take the girl into the dissecting room.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. Why?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. I wish to experiment on her.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. Upon--Helena?\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Of course. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear me? Or must I call _someone else_ to\r\ntake her in?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. If you do, I will kill you. (_Steps toward ALQUIST._)\r\n\r\n\r\n  (_WARN Curtain._)\r\n\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Kill me--kill me, then. What will your future be?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. Sir, take me. I am made on the same day as she is. Take my\r\nlife, sir. (_Step to ALQUIST._)\r\n\r\nHELENA. No, no, you shall not.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Wait, girl, wait. (_To PRIMUS_) Do you not wish to live, then?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. Not without her. I will not live without her.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Very well, I will use _you_. Into the dissecting room with you.\r\n\r\nHELENA. Primus. Primus. (_She bursts into tears and moves R. ALQUIST\r\nstops her._)\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Child, child, you can weep. Tears. What is Primus to you? One\r\nPrimus more or less in the world--what does it matter?\r\n\r\nHELENA. I will go myself.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Where? Into the dissecting room?\r\n\r\nHELENA. (_Crosses to R._) Yes. In there--to be cut. (_PRIMUS stops her\r\nfrom going._) Let me pass, Primus, let me pass.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. You shall not go in there, Helena.\r\n\r\nHELENA. If you go in there and I do not, I will kill myself.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. (_To ALQUIST_) I will not let you. Man you shall kill neither\r\nof us.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Why?\r\n\r\nPRIMUS. We--we--belong to each other.\r\n\r\nALQUIST. Go. (_Exit PRIMUS and HELENA L._) Adam--Eve.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR. U.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
