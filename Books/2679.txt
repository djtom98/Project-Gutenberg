Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any\r\nof these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\r\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\r\n\r\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\r\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\r\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\r\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\r\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\r\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\r\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\r\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\r\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\r\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\r\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\r\n\r\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\r\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\r\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\r\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\r\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\r\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\r\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\r\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\r\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\r\n\r\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\r\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\r\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\r\nfrom Michael Hart\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\r\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\r\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\r\ndon\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\r\n\r\nWe need your donations more than ever!\r\n\r\n\r\nAll donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are\r\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

That "irresistible needle-touch,"\r\nas one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very\r\ncore of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as\r\nit has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling\r\npower.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to\r\nform with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.\r\n\r\nAlthough Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending\r\noccasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of\r\nher writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend "H.H."\r\nmust at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th\r\nSeptember, 1884, she wrote:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses\r\nyou must have! It is a cruel wrong to your "day and\r\ngeneration" that you will not give them light.\r\n\r\nIf such a thing should happen as that I should outlive\r\nyou, I wish you would make me your literary legatee\r\nand executor. Surely after you are what is called\r\n"dead" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you\r\nhave left behind should be cheered and pleased by your\r\nverses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think\r\nwe have a right to withhold from the world a word or\r\na thought any more than a deed which might help a\r\nsingle soul. . . .\r\n\r\n                Truly yours,\r\n\r\n                        HELEN JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe "portfolios" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson\'s death,\r\nby her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had\r\nbeen carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little\r\nfascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear\r\nevidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had\r\nreceived thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of\r\nrather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and\r\nphrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one\r\nform, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without\r\nimportant exception, her friends have generously placed at the\r\ndisposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and\r\nthese have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several\r\nrenderings of the same verse.\r\n\r\nTo what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been\r\nsubjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They\r\nshould be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and\r\nsuggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some\r\ntime in the finished picture.\r\n\r\nEmily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the\r\nwinter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the\r\nApril following, she says, "I made no verse, but one or two, until\r\nthis winter."\r\n\r\nThe handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running\r\nItalian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in\r\nbreadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her\r\nlatest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its\r\nfellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,\r\neverything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous\r\ndashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of\r\na page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and\r\nstrong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of\r\nthe earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,\r\nthe handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general\r\nchronologic accuracy.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the verses were without titles; but "A Country Burial,"\r\n"A Thunder-Storm," "The Humming-Bird," and a few others were named\r\nby their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the\r\naccompanying note, if sent to a friend.\r\n\r\nThe variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in\r\npencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of\r\nresponsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not\r\nabsolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her\r\nrendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it\r\nseems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and\r\nmore usual rhymes.\r\n\r\nLike impressionist pictures, or Wagner\'s rugged music, the very\r\nabsence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily\r\nDickinson\'s exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a\r\nparticular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything\r\nvirtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of\r\ninner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and\r\nthe "thought-rhyme" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an\r\nunrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.\r\n\r\nEmily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.\r\nEvery subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the\r\nsombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She\r\ntouches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost\r\nhumorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is\r\nnever by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic\r\nhas said, she may exhibit toward God "an Emersonian self-possession,"\r\nit was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced\r\nas it is rare.\r\n\r\nShe had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She\r\nwas not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no\r\nlove-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature\r\nintrospective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist\r\nin pretence.\r\n\r\nStorm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and\r\nbees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted\r\nhuman friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the\r\nfirst robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of\r\npope; the first red leaf hurrying through "the altered air," an\r\nepoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or\r\nmelancholy, she lived in its presence.\r\n\r\n                                MABEL LOOMIS TODD.\r\n\r\n        AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,\r\n            August, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        My nosegays are for captives;\r\n           Dim, long-expectant eyes,\r\n        Fingers denied the plucking,\r\n           Patient till paradise,\r\n\r\n        To such, if they should whisper\r\n           Of morning and the moor,\r\n        They bear no other errand,\r\n           And I, no other prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        I.\r\n\r\nI\'m nobody!  Who are you?\r\nAre you nobody, too?\r\nThen there \'s a pair of us -- don\'t tell!\r\nThey \'d banish us, you know.\r\n\r\nHow dreary to be somebody!\r\nHow public, like a frog\r\nTo tell your name the livelong day\r\nTo an admiring bog!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        II.\r\n\r\nI bring an unaccustomed wine\r\nTo lips long parching, next to mine,\r\nAnd summon them to drink.\r\n\r\nCrackling with fever, they essay;\r\nI turn my brimming eyes away,\r\nAnd come next hour to look.\r\n\r\nThe hands still hug the tardy glass;\r\nThe lips I would have cooled, alas!\r\nAre so superfluous cold,\r\n\r\nI would as soon attempt to warm\r\nThe bosoms where the frost has lain\r\nAges beneath the mould.\r\n\r\nSome other thirsty there may be\r\nTo whom this would have pointed me\r\nHad it remained to speak.\r\n\r\nAnd so I always bear the cup\r\nIf, haply, mine may be the drop\r\nSome pilgrim thirst to slake, --\r\n\r\nIf, haply, any say to me,\r\n"Unto the little, unto me,"\r\nWhen I at last awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        III.\r\n\r\nThe nearest dream recedes, unrealized.\r\n      The heaven we chase\r\n      Like the June bee\r\n      Before the school-boy\r\n      Invites the race;\r\n      Stoops to an easy clover --\r\nDips -- evades -- teases -- deploys;\r\n      Then to the royal clouds\r\n      Lifts his light pinnace\r\n      Heedless of the boy\r\nStaring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.\r\n\r\n      Homesick for steadfast honey,\r\n      Ah! the bee flies not\r\nThat brews that rare variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        IV.\r\n\r\nWe play at paste,\r\nTill qualified for pearl,\r\nThen drop the paste,\r\nAnd deem ourself a fool.\r\nThe shapes, though, were similar,\r\nAnd our new hands\r\nLearned gem-tactics\r\nPractising sands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        V.\r\n\r\nI found the phrase to every thought\r\nI ever had, but one;\r\nAnd that defies me, -- as a hand\r\nDid try to chalk the sun\r\n\r\nTo races nurtured in the dark; --\r\nHow would your own begin?\r\nCan blaze be done in cochineal,\r\nOr noon in mazarin?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        VI.\r\n\r\n        HOPE.\r\n\r\nHope is the thing with feathers\r\nThat perches in the soul,\r\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\r\nAnd never stops at all,\r\n\r\nAnd sweetest in the gale is heard;\r\nAnd sore must be the storm\r\nThat could abash the little bird\r\nThat kept so many warm.\r\n\r\nI \'ve heard it in the chillest land,\r\nAnd on the strangest sea;\r\nYet, never, in extremity,\r\nIt asked a crumb of me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        VII.\r\n\r\n   THE WHITE HEAT.\r\n\r\nDare you see a soul at the white heat?\r\n   Then crouch within the door.\r\nRed is the fire\'s common tint;\r\n   But when the vivid ore\r\n\r\nHas sated flame\'s conditions,\r\n   Its quivering substance plays\r\nWithout a color but the light\r\n   Of unanointed blaze.\r\n\r\nLeast village boasts its blacksmith,\r\n   Whose anvil\'s even din\r\nStands symbol for the finer forge\r\n   That soundless tugs within,\r\n\r\nRefining these impatient ores\r\n   With hammer and with blaze,\r\nUntil the designated light\r\n   Repudiate the forge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        VIII.\r\n\r\n     TRIUMPHANT.\r\n\r\nWho never lost, are unprepared\r\nA coronet to find;\r\nWho never thirsted, flagons\r\nAnd cooling tamarind.\r\n\r\nWho never climbed the weary league --\r\nCan such a foot explore\r\nThe purple territories\r\nOn Pizarro\'s shore?\r\n\r\nHow many legions overcome?\r\nThe emperor will say.\r\nHow many colors taken\r\nOn Revolution Day?\r\n\r\nHow many bullets bearest?\r\nThe royal scar hast thou?\r\nAngels, write "Promoted"\r\nOn this soldier\'s brow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        IX.\r\n\r\n     THE TEST.\r\n\r\nI can wade grief,\r\nWhole pools of it, --\r\nI \'m used to that.\r\nBut the least push of joy\r\nBreaks up my feet,\r\nAnd I tip -- drunken.\r\nLet no pebble smile,\r\n\'T was the new liquor, --\r\nThat was all!\r\n\r\nPower is only pain,\r\nStranded, through discipline,\r\nTill weights will hang.\r\nGive balm to giants,\r\nAnd they \'ll wilt, like men.\r\nGive Himmaleh, --\r\nThey \'ll carry him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        X.\r\n\r\n     ESCAPE.\r\n\r\nI never hear the word "escape"\r\nWithout a quicker blood,\r\nA sudden expectation,\r\nA flying attitude.\r\n\r\nI never hear of prisons broad\r\nBy soldiers battered down,\r\nBut I tug childish at my bars, --\r\nOnly to fail again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XI.\r\n\r\n   COMPENSATION.\r\n\r\nFor each ecstatic instant\r\nWe must an anguish pay\r\nIn keen and quivering ratio\r\nTo the ecstasy.\r\n\r\nFor each beloved hour\r\nSharp pittances of years,\r\nBitter contested farthings\r\nAnd coffers heaped with tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XII.\r\n\r\n    THE MARTYRS.\r\n\r\nThrough the straight pass of suffering\r\nThe martyrs even trod,\r\nTheir feet upon temptation,\r\nTheir faces upon God.\r\n\r\nA stately, shriven company;\r\nConvulsion playing round,\r\nHarmless as streaks of meteor\r\nUpon a planet\'s bound.\r\n\r\nTheir faith the everlasting troth;\r\nTheir expectation fair;\r\nThe needle to the north degree\r\nWades so, through polar air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XIII.\r\n\r\n      A PRAYER.\r\n\r\nI meant to have but modest needs,\r\nSuch as content, and heaven;\r\nWithin my income these could lie,\r\nAnd life and I keep even.\r\n\r\nBut since the last included both,\r\nIt would suffice my prayer\r\nBut just for one to stipulate,\r\nAnd grace would grant the pair.\r\n\r\nAnd so, upon this wise I prayed, --\r\nGreat Spirit, give to me\r\nA heaven not so large as yours,\r\nBut large enough for me.\r\n\r\nA smile suffused Jehovah\'s face;\r\nThe cherubim withdrew;\r\nGrave saints stole out to look at me,\r\nAnd showed their dimples, too.\r\n\r\nI left the place with all my might, --\r\nMy prayer away I threw;\r\nThe quiet ages picked it up,\r\nAnd Judgment twinkled, too,\r\n\r\nThat one so honest be extant\r\nAs take the tale for true\r\nThat "Whatsoever you shall ask,\r\nItself be given you."\r\n\r\nBut I, grown shrewder, scan the skies\r\nWith a suspicious air, --\r\nAs children, swindled for the first,\r\nAll swindlers be, infer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XIV.\r\n\r\nThe thought beneath so slight a film\r\nIs more distinctly seen, --\r\nAs laces just reveal the surge,\r\nOr mists the Apennine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XV.\r\n\r\nThe soul unto itself\r\nIs an imperial friend, --\r\nOr the most agonizing spy\r\nAn enemy could send.\r\n\r\nSecure against its own,\r\nNo treason it can fear;\r\nItself its sovereign, of itself\r\nThe soul should stand in awe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XVI.\r\n\r\nSurgeons must be very careful\r\nWhen they take the knife!\r\nUnderneath their fine incisions\r\nStirs the culprit, -- Life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XVII.\r\n\r\n  THE RAILWAY TRAIN.\r\n\r\nI like to see it lap the miles,\r\nAnd lick the valleys up,\r\nAnd stop to feed itself at tanks;\r\nAnd then, prodigious, step\r\n\r\nAround a pile of mountains,\r\nAnd, supercilious, peer\r\nIn shanties by the sides of roads;\r\nAnd then a quarry pare\r\n\r\nTo fit its sides, and crawl between,\r\nComplaining all the while\r\nIn horrid, hooting stanza;\r\nThen chase itself down hill\r\n\r\nAnd neigh like Boanerges;\r\nThen, punctual as a star,\r\nStop -- docile and omnipotent --\r\nAt its own stable door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XVIII.\r\n\r\n      THE SHOW.\r\n\r\nThe show is not the show,\r\nBut they that go.\r\nMenagerie to me\r\nMy neighbor be.\r\nFair play --\r\nBoth went to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XIX.\r\n\r\nDelight becomes pictorial\r\nWhen viewed through pain, --\r\nMore fair, because impossible\r\nThat any gain.\r\n\r\nThe mountain at a given distance\r\nIn amber lies;\r\nApproached, the amber flits a little, --\r\nAnd that \'s the skies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XX.\r\n\r\nA thought went up my mind to-day\r\nThat I have had before,\r\nBut did not finish, -- some way back,\r\nI could not fix the year,\r\n\r\nNor where it went, nor why it came\r\nThe second time to me,\r\nNor definitely what it was,\r\nHave I the art to say.\r\n\r\nBut somewhere in my soul, I know\r\nI \'ve met the thing before;\r\nIt just reminded me -- \'t was all --\r\nAnd came my way no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXI.\r\n\r\nIs Heaven a physician?\r\n   They say that He can heal;\r\nBut medicine posthumous\r\n   Is unavailable.\r\n\r\nIs Heaven an exchequer?\r\n   They speak of what we owe;\r\nBut that negotiation\r\n   I \'m not a party to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXII.\r\n\r\n     THE RETURN.\r\n\r\nThough I get home how late, how late!\r\nSo I get home, \'t will compensate.\r\nBetter will be the ecstasy\r\nThat they have done expecting me,\r\nWhen, night descending, dumb and dark,\r\nThey hear my unexpected knock.\r\nTransporting must the moment be,\r\nBrewed from decades of agony!\r\n\r\nTo think just how the fire will burn,\r\nJust how long-cheated eyes will turn\r\nTo wonder what myself will say,\r\nAnd what itself will say to me,\r\nBeguiles the centuries of way!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIII.\r\n\r\nA poor torn heart, a tattered heart,\r\nThat sat it down to rest,\r\nNor noticed that the ebbing day\r\nFlowed silver to the west,\r\nNor noticed night did soft descend\r\nNor constellation burn,\r\nIntent upon the vision\r\nOf latitudes unknown.\r\n\r\nThe angels, happening that way,\r\nThis dusty heart espied;\r\nTenderly took it up from toil\r\nAnd carried it to God.\r\nThere, -- sandals for the barefoot;\r\nThere, -- gathered from the gales,\r\nDo the blue havens by the hand\r\nLead the wandering sails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIV.\r\n\r\n      TOO MUCH.\r\n\r\nI should have been too glad, I see,\r\nToo lifted for the scant degree\r\n   Of life\'s penurious round;\r\nMy little circuit would have shamed\r\nThis new circumference, have blamed\r\n   The homelier time behind.\r\n\r\nI should have been too saved, I see,\r\nToo rescued; fear too dim to me\r\n   That I could spell the prayer\r\nI knew so perfect yesterday, --\r\nThat scalding one, "Sabachthani,"\r\n   Recited fluent here.\r\n\r\nEarth would have been too much, I see,\r\nAnd heaven not enough for me;\r\n   I should have had the joy\r\nWithout the fear to justify, --\r\nThe palm without the Calvary;\r\n   So, Saviour, crucify.\r\n\r\nDefeat whets victory, they say;\r\nThe reefs in old Gethsemane\r\n   Endear the shore beyond.\r\n\'T is beggars banquets best define;\r\n\'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, --\r\n   Faith faints to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXV.\r\n\r\n     SHIPWRECK.\r\n\r\nIt tossed and tossed, --\r\nA little brig I knew, --\r\nO\'ertook by blast,\r\nIt spun and spun,\r\nAnd groped delirious, for morn.\r\n\r\nIt slipped and slipped,\r\nAs one that drunken stepped;\r\nIts white foot tripped,\r\nThen dropped from sight.\r\n\r\nAh, brig, good-night\r\nTo crew and you;\r\nThe ocean\'s heart too smooth, too blue,\r\nTo break for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVI.\r\n\r\nVictory comes late,\r\nAnd is held low to freezing lips\r\nToo rapt with frost\r\nTo take it.\r\nHow sweet it would have tasted,\r\nJust a drop!\r\nWas God so economical?\r\nHis table \'s spread too high for us\r\nUnless we dine on tip-toe.\r\nCrumbs fit such little mouths,\r\nCherries suit robins;\r\nThe eagle\'s golden breakfast\r\nStrangles them.\r\nGod keeps his oath to sparrows,\r\nWho of little love\r\nKnow how to starve!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVII.\r\n\r\n       ENOUGH.\r\n\r\nGod gave a loaf to every bird,\r\nBut just a crumb to me;\r\nI dare not eat it, though I starve, --\r\nMy poignant luxury\r\nTo own it, touch it, prove the feat\r\nThat made the pellet mine, --\r\nToo happy in my sparrow chance\r\nFor ampler coveting.\r\n\r\nIt might be famine all around,\r\nI could not miss an ear,\r\nSuch plenty smiles upon my board,\r\nMy garner shows so fair.\r\nI wonder how the rich may feel, --\r\nAn Indiaman -- an Earl?\r\nI deem that I with but a crumb\r\nAm sovereign of them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVIII.\r\n\r\nExperiment to me\r\nIs every one I meet.\r\nIf it contain a kernel?\r\nThe figure of a nut\r\n\r\nPresents upon a tree,\r\nEqually plausibly;\r\nBut meat within is requisite,\r\nTo squirrels and to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIX.\r\n\r\n MY COUNTRY\'S WARDROBE.\r\n\r\nMy country need not change her gown,\r\nHer triple suit as sweet\r\nAs when \'t was cut at Lexington,\r\nAnd first pronounced "a fit."\r\n\r\nGreat Britain disapproves "the stars;"\r\nDisparagement discreet, --\r\nThere \'s something in their attitude\r\nThat taunts her bayonet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXX.\r\n\r\nFaith is a fine invention\r\nFor gentlemen who see;\r\nBut microscopes are prudent\r\nIn an emergency!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXI.\r\n\r\nExcept the heaven had come so near,\r\nSo seemed to choose my door,\r\nThe distance would not haunt me so;\r\nI had not hoped before.\r\n\r\nBut just to hear the grace depart\r\nI never thought to see,\r\nAfflicts me with a double loss;\r\n\'T is lost, and lost to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXII.\r\n\r\nPortraits are to daily faces\r\nAs an evening west\r\nTo a fine, pedantic sunshine\r\nIn a satin vest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIII.\r\n\r\n       THE DUEL.\r\n\r\nI took my power in my hand.\r\nAnd went against the world;\r\n\'T was not so much as David had,\r\nBut I was twice as bold.\r\n\r\nI aimed my pebble, but myself\r\nWas all the one that fell.\r\nWas it Goliath was too large,\r\nOr only I too small?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIV.\r\n\r\nA shady friend for torrid days\r\nIs easier to find\r\nThan one of higher temperature\r\nFor frigid hour of mind.\r\n\r\nThe vane a little to the east\r\nScares muslin souls away;\r\nIf broadcloth breasts are firmer\r\nThan those of organdy,\r\n\r\nWho is to blame? The weaver?\r\nAh! the bewildering thread!\r\nThe tapestries of paradise\r\nSo notelessly are made!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXV.\r\n\r\n      THE GOAL.\r\n\r\nEach life converges to some centre\r\nExpressed or still;\r\nExists in every human nature\r\nA goal,\r\n\r\nAdmitted scarcely to itself, it may be,\r\nToo fair\r\nFor credibility\'s temerity\r\nTo dare.\r\n\r\nAdored with caution, as a brittle heaven,\r\nTo reach\r\nWere hopeless as the rainbow\'s raiment\r\nTo touch,\r\n\r\nYet persevered toward, surer for the distance;\r\nHow high\r\nUnto the saints\' slow diligence\r\nThe sky!\r\n\r\nUngained, it may be, by a life\'s low venture,\r\nBut then,\r\nEternity enables the endeavoring\r\nAgain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVI.\r\n\r\n        SIGHT.\r\n\r\nBefore I got my eye put out,\r\nI liked as well to see\r\nAs other creatures that have eyes,\r\nAnd know no other way.\r\n\r\nBut were it told to me, to-day,\r\nThat I might have the sky\r\nFor mine, I tell you that my heart\r\nWould split, for size of me.\r\n\r\nThe meadows mine, the mountains mine, --\r\nAll forests, stintless stars,\r\nAs much of noon as I could take\r\nBetween my finite eyes.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the dipping birds,\r\nThe lightning\'s jointed road,\r\nFor mine to look at when I liked, --\r\nThe news would strike me dead!\r\n\r\nSo safer, guess, with just my soul\r\nUpon the window-pane\r\nWhere other creatures put their eyes,\r\nIncautious of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTalk with prudence to a beggar\r\nOf "Potosi" and the mines!\r\nReverently to the hungry\r\nOf your viands and your wines!\r\n\r\nCautious, hint to any captive\r\nYou have passed enfranchised feet!\r\nAnecdotes of air in dungeons\r\nHave sometimes proved deadly sweet!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n     THE PREACHER.\r\n\r\nHe preached upon "breadth" till it argued him narrow, --\r\nThe broad are too broad to define;\r\nAnd of "truth" until it proclaimed him a liar, --\r\nThe truth never flaunted a sign.\r\n\r\nSimplicity fled from his counterfeit presence\r\nAs gold the pyrites would shun.\r\nWhat confusion would cover the innocent Jesus\r\nTo meet so enabled a man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIX.\r\n\r\nGood night! which put the candle out?\r\nA jealous zephyr, not a doubt.\r\n   Ah! friend, you little knew\r\nHow long at that celestial wick\r\nThe angels labored diligent;\r\n   Extinguished, now, for you!\r\n\r\nIt might have been the lighthouse spark\r\nSome sailor, rowing in the dark,\r\n   Had importuned to see!\r\nIt might have been the waning lamp\r\nThat lit the drummer from the camp\r\n   To purer reveille!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XL.\r\n\r\nWhen I hoped I feared,\r\nSince I hoped I dared;\r\nEverywhere alone\r\nAs a church remain;\r\nSpectre cannot harm,\r\nSerpent cannot charm;\r\nHe deposes doom,\r\nWho hath suffered him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLI.\r\n\r\n       DEED.\r\n\r\nA deed knocks first at thought,\r\nAnd then it knocks at will.\r\nThat is the manufacturing spot,\r\nAnd will at home and well.\r\n\r\nIt then goes out an act,\r\nOr is entombed so still\r\nThat only to the ear of God\r\nIts doom is audible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLII.\r\n\r\n   TIME\'S LESSON.\r\n\r\nMine enemy is growing old, --\r\nI have at last revenge.\r\nThe palate of the hate departs;\r\nIf any would avenge, --\r\n\r\nLet him be quick, the viand flits,\r\nIt is a faded meat.\r\nAnger as soon as fed is dead;\r\n\'T is starving makes it fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLIII.\r\n\r\n       REMORSE.\r\n\r\nRemorse is memory awake,\r\nHer companies astir, --\r\nA presence of departed acts\r\nAt window and at door.\r\n\r\nIt\'s past set down before the soul,\r\nAnd lighted with a match,\r\nPerusal to facilitate\r\nOf its condensed despatch.\r\n\r\nRemorse is cureless, -- the disease\r\nNot even God can heal;\r\nFor \'t is his institution, --\r\nThe complement of hell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLIV.\r\n\r\n    THE SHELTER.\r\n\r\nThe body grows outside, --\r\nThe more convenient way, --\r\nThat if the spirit like to hide,\r\nIts temple stands alway\r\n\r\nAjar, secure, inviting;\r\nIt never did betray\r\nThe soul that asked its shelter\r\nIn timid honesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLV.\r\n\r\nUndue significance a starving man attaches\r\nTo food\r\nFar off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless,\r\nAnd therefore good.\r\n\r\nPartaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us\r\nThat spices fly\r\nIn the receipt. It was the distance\r\nWas savory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLVI.\r\n\r\nHeart not so heavy as mine,\r\nWending late home,\r\nAs it passed my window\r\nWhistled itself a tune, --\r\n\r\nA careless snatch, a ballad,\r\nA ditty of the street;\r\nYet to my irritated ear\r\nAn anodyne so sweet,\r\n\r\nIt was as if a bobolink,\r\nSauntering this way,\r\nCarolled and mused and carolled,\r\nThen bubbled slow away.\r\n\r\nIt was as if a chirping brook\r\nUpon a toilsome way\r\nSet bleeding feet to minuets\r\nWithout the knowing why.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow, night will come again,\r\nWeary, perhaps, and sore.\r\nAh, bugle, by my window,\r\nI pray you stroll once more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLVII.\r\n\r\nI many times thought peace had come,\r\nWhen peace was far away;\r\nAs wrecked men deem they sight the land\r\nAt centre of the sea,\r\n\r\nAnd struggle slacker, but to prove,\r\nAs hopelessly as I,\r\nHow many the fictitious shores\r\nBefore the harbor lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLVIII.\r\n\r\nUnto my books so good to turn\r\nFar ends of tired days;\r\nIt half endears the abstinence,\r\nAnd pain is missed in praise.\r\n\r\nAs flavors cheer retarded guests\r\nWith banquetings to be,\r\nSo spices stimulate the time\r\nTill my small library.\r\n\r\nIt may be wilderness without,\r\nFar feet of failing men,\r\nBut holiday excludes the night,\r\nAnd it is bells within.\r\n\r\nI thank these kinsmen of the shelf;\r\nTheir countenances bland\r\nEnamour in prospective,\r\nAnd satisfy, obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLIX.\r\n\r\nThis merit hath the worst, --\r\nIt cannot be again.\r\nWhen Fate hath taunted last\r\nAnd thrown her furthest stone,\r\n\r\nThe maimed may pause and breathe,\r\nAnd glance securely round.\r\nThe deer invites no longer\r\nThan it eludes the hound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        L.\r\n\r\n     HUNGER.\r\n\r\nI had been hungry all the years;\r\nMy noon had come, to dine;\r\nI, trembling, drew the table near,\r\nAnd touched the curious wine.\r\n\r\n\'T was this on tables I had seen,\r\nWhen turning, hungry, lone,\r\nI looked in windows, for the wealth\r\nI could not hope to own.\r\n\r\nI did not know the ample bread,\r\n\'T was so unlike the crumb\r\nThe birds and I had often shared\r\nIn Nature\'s dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe plenty hurt me, \'t was so new, --\r\nMyself felt ill and odd,\r\nAs berry of a mountain bush\r\nTransplanted to the road.\r\n\r\nNor was I hungry; so I found\r\nThat hunger was a way\r\nOf persons outside windows,\r\nThe entering takes away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        LI.\r\n\r\nI gained it so,\r\n      By climbing slow,\r\nBy catching at the twigs that grow\r\nBetween the bliss and me.\r\n      It hung so high,\r\n      As well the sky\r\n      Attempt by strategy.\r\n\r\nI said I gained it, --\r\n      This was all.\r\nLook, how I clutch it,\r\n      Lest it fall,\r\nAnd I a pauper go;\r\nUnfitted by an instant\'s grace\r\nFor the contented beggar\'s face\r\nI wore an hour ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        LII.\r\n\r\nTo learn the transport by the pain,\r\nAs blind men learn the sun;\r\nTo die of thirst, suspecting\r\nThat brooks in meadows run;\r\n\r\nTo stay the homesick, homesick feet\r\nUpon a foreign shore\r\nHaunted by native lands, the while,\r\nAnd blue, beloved air --\r\n\r\nThis is the sovereign anguish,\r\nThis, the signal woe!\r\nThese are the patient laureates\r\nWhose voices, trained below,\r\n\r\nAscend in ceaseless carol,\r\nInaudible, indeed,\r\nTo us, the duller scholars\r\nOf the mysterious bard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        LIII.\r\n\r\n     RETURNING.\r\n\r\nI years had been from home,\r\nAnd now, before the door,\r\nI dared not open, lest a face\r\nI never saw before\r\n\r\nStare vacant into mine\r\nAnd ask my business there.\r\nMy business, -- just a life I left,\r\nWas such still dwelling there?\r\n\r\nI fumbled at my nerve,\r\nI scanned the windows near;\r\nThe silence like an ocean rolled,\r\nAnd broke against my ear.\r\n\r\nI laughed a wooden laugh\r\nThat I could fear a door,\r\nWho danger and the dead had faced,\r\nBut never quaked before.\r\n\r\nI fitted to the latch\r\nMy hand, with trembling care,\r\nLest back the awful door should spring,\r\nAnd leave me standing there.\r\n\r\nI moved my fingers off\r\nAs cautiously as glass,\r\nAnd held my ears, and like a thief\r\nFled gasping from the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        LIV.\r\n\r\n       PRAYER.\r\n\r\nPrayer is the little implement\r\nThrough which men reach\r\nWhere presence is denied them.\r\nThey fling their speech\r\n\r\nBy means of it in God\'s ear;\r\nIf then He hear,\r\nThis sums the apparatus\r\nComprised in prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        LV.\r\n\r\nI know that he exists\r\nSomewhere, in silence.\r\nHe has hid his rare life\r\nFrom our gross eyes.\r\n\r\n\'T is an instant\'s play,\r\n\'T is a fond ambush,\r\nJust to make bliss\r\nEarn her own surprise!\r\n\r\nBut should the play\r\nProve piercing earnest,\r\nShould the glee glaze\r\nIn death\'s stiff stare,\r\n\r\nWould not the fun\r\nLook too expensive?\r\nWould not the jest\r\nHave crawled too far?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        LVI.\r\n\r\n  MELODIES UNHEARD.\r\n\r\nMusicians wrestle everywhere:\r\nAll day, among the crowded air,\r\n  I hear the silver strife;\r\nAnd -- waking long before the dawn --\r\nSuch transport breaks upon the town\r\n  I think it that "new life!"\r\n\r\nIt is not bird, it has no nest;\r\nNor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,\r\n  Nor tambourine, nor man;\r\nIt is not hymn from pulpit read, --\r\nThe morning stars the treble led\r\n  On time\'s first afternoon!\r\n\r\nSome say it is the spheres at play!\r\nSome say that bright majority\r\n  Of vanished dames and men!\r\nSome think it service in the place\r\nWhere we, with late, celestial face,\r\n  Please God, shall ascertain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        LVII.\r\n\r\n     CALLED BACK.\r\n\r\nJust lost when I was saved!\r\nJust felt the world go by!\r\nJust girt me for the onset with eternity,\r\nWhen breath blew back,\r\nAnd on the other side\r\nI heard recede the disappointed tide!\r\n\r\nTherefore, as one returned, I feel,\r\nOdd secrets of the line to tell!\r\nSome sailor, skirting foreign shores,\r\nSome pale reporter from the awful doors\r\nBefore the seal!\r\n\r\nNext time, to stay!\r\nNext time, the things to see\r\nBy ear unheard,\r\nUnscrutinized by eye.\r\n\r\nNext time, to tarry,\r\nWhile the ages steal, --\r\nSlow tramp the centuries,\r\nAnd the cycles wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

away,\r\nAnd subterfuge is done;\r\n\r\nWhen that which is and that which was\r\nApart, intrinsic, stand,\r\nAnd this brief tragedy of flesh\r\nIs shifted like a sand;\r\n\r\nWhen figures show their

taught me poverty.\r\nMyself a millionnaire\r\nIn little wealths, -- as girls could boast, --\r\nTill broad as Buenos Ayre,\r\n\r\nYou drifted your dominions\r\nA different Peru;\r\nAnd I esteemed all poverty,\r\nFor life\'s estate with you.\r\n\r\nOf mines I little know, myself,\r\nBut just the names of gems, --\r\nThe colors of the commonest;\r\nAnd scarce of diadems\r\n\r\nSo much that, did I meet the queen,\r\nHer glory I should know:\r\nBut this must be a different wealth,\r\nTo miss it beggars so.\r\n\r\nI \'m sure \'t is India all day\r\nTo those who look on you\r\nWithout a stint,

then clambered up\r\nAnd fretted in the eaves.\r\n\r\nNo squirrel went abroad;\r\nA dog\'s belated feet\r\nLike intermittent plush were heard\r\nAdown the empty street.\r\n\r\nTo feel if blinds be fast,\r\nAnd closer to the fire\r\nHer little rocking-chair to draw,\r\nAnd shiver for the poor,\r\n\r\nThe housewife\'s gentle task.\r\n"How pleasanter," said she\r\nUnto the sofa opposite,\r\n"The sleet than May -- no thee!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        IX.\r\n\r\n    POSSESSION.\r\n\r\nDid the harebell loose her girdle\r\nTo the lover bee,\r\nWould the bee the harebell hallow\r\nMuch as formerly?\r\n\r\nDid the paradise, persuaded,\r\nYield her moat of pearl,\r\nWould the Eden be an Eden,\r\nOr the earl an earl?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        X.\r\n\r\nA charm invests a face\r\nImperfectly beheld, --\r\nThe lady dare not lift her veil\r\nFor fear it be dispelled.\r\n\r\nBut peers beyond her mesh,\r\nAnd wishes, and denies, --\r\nLest interview annul a want\r\nThat image satisfies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XI.\r\n\r\n    THE LOVERS.\r\n\r\nThe rose did caper on her cheek,\r\nHer bodice rose and fell,\r\nHer pretty speech, like drunken men,\r\nDid stagger pitiful.\r\n\r\nHer fingers fumbled at her work, --\r\nHer needle would not go;\r\nWhat ailed so smart a little maid\r\nIt puzzled me to know,\r\n\r\nTill opposite I spied a cheek\r\nThat bore another rose;\r\nJust opposite, another speech\r\nThat like the drunkard goes;\r\n\r\nA vest that, like the bodice, danced\r\nTo the immortal tune, --\r\nTill those two troubled little clocks\r\nTicked softly into one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XII.\r\n\r\nIn lands I never saw, they say,\r\nImmortal Alps look down,\r\nWhose bonnets touch the firmament,\r\nWhose sandals touch the town, --\r\n\r\nMeek at whose everlasting feet\r\nA myriad daisies play.\r\nWhich, sir, are you, and which am I,\r\nUpon an August day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XIII.\r\n\r\nThe moon is distant from the sea,\r\nAnd yet with amber hands\r\nShe leads him, docile as a boy,\r\nAlong appointed sands.\r\n\r\nHe never misses a degree;\r\nObedient to her eye,\r\nHe comes just so far toward the town,\r\nJust so far goes away.\r\n\r\nOh, Signor, thine the amber hand,\r\nAnd mine the distant sea, --\r\nObedient to the least command\r\nThine eyes impose on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XIV.\r\n\r\nHe put the belt around my life, --\r\nI heard the buckle snap,\r\nAnd turned away, imperial,\r\nMy lifetime folding up\r\nDeliberate, as a duke would do\r\nA kingdom\'s title-deed, --\r\nHenceforth a dedicated sort,\r\nA member of the cloud.\r\n\r\nYet not too far to come at call,\r\nAnd do the little toils\r\nThat make the circuit of the rest,\r\nAnd deal occasional smiles\r\nTo lives that stoop to notice mine\r\nAnd kindly ask it in, --\r\nWhose invitation, knew you not\r\nFor whom I must decline?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XV.\r\n\r\n  THE LOST JEWEL.\r\n\r\nI held a jewel in my fingers\r\nAnd went to sleep.\r\nThe day was warm, and winds were prosy;\r\nI said: "\'T will keep."\r\n\r\nI woke and chid my honest fingers, --\r\nThe gem was gone;\r\nAnd now an amethyst remembrance\r\nIs all I own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XVI.\r\n\r\nWhat if I say I shall not wait?\r\nWhat if I burst the fleshly gate\r\nAnd pass, escaped, to thee?\r\nWhat if I file this mortal off,\r\nSee where it hurt me, -- that \'s enough, --\r\nAnd wade in liberty?\r\n\r\nThey cannot take us any more, --\r\nDungeons may call, and guns implore;\r\nUnmeaning now, to me,\r\nAs laughter was an hour ago,\r\nOr laces, or a travelling show,\r\nOr who died yesterday!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 III.\r\n\r\n                NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        I.\r\n\r\n  MOTHER NATURE.\r\n\r\nNature, the gentlest mother,\r\nImpatient of no child,\r\nThe feeblest or the waywardest, --\r\nHer admonition mild\r\n\r\nIn forest and the hill\r\nBy traveller is heard,\r\nRestraining rampant squirrel\r\nOr too impetuous bird.\r\n\r\nHow fair her conversation,\r\nA summer afternoon, --\r\nHer household, her assembly;\r\nAnd when the sun goes down\r\n\r\nHer voice among the aisles\r\nIncites the timid prayer\r\nOf the minutest cricket,\r\nThe most unworthy flower.\r\n\r\nWhen all the children sleep\r\nShe turns as long away\r\nAs will suffice to light her lamps;\r\nThen, bending from the sky\r\n\r\nWith infinite affection\r\nAnd infiniter care,\r\nHer golden finger on her lip,\r\nWills silence everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        II.\r\n\r\n OUT OF THE MORNING.\r\n\r\nWill there really be a morning?\r\nIs there such a thing as day?\r\nCould I see it from the mountains\r\nIf I were as tall as they?\r\n\r\nHas it feet like water-lilies?\r\nHas it feathers like a bird?\r\nIs it brought from famous countries\r\nOf which I have never heard?\r\n\r\nOh, some scholar!

XVIII.\r\n\r\n    TWO VOYAGERS.\r\n\r\nTwo butterflies went out at noon\r\nAnd waltzed above a stream,\r\nThen stepped straight through the firmament\r\nAnd rested on a beam;\r\n\r\nAnd then together bore away\r\nUpon a shining sea, --\r\nThough never yet, in any port,\r\nTheir coming mentioned be.\r\n\r\nIf spoken by the distant bird,\r\nIf met in ether sea\r\nBy frigate or by

to look at me,\r\n\r\nAnd frigates in the upper floor\r\nExtended hempen hands,\r\nPresuming me to be a mouse\r\nAground, upon the sands.\r\n\r\nBut no man moved me till the tide\r\nWent past my simple shoe,\r\nAnd past my apron and my belt,\r\nAnd past my bodice too,\r\n\r\nAnd made as he would eat me up\r\nAs wholly as a dew\r\nUpon a dandelion\'s sleeve --\r\nAnd then I started too.\r\n\r\nAnd he -- he followed close behind;\r\nI felt his silver heel\r\nUpon my ankle, -- then my shoes\r\nWould overflow with pearl.\r\n\r\nUntil we met the solid town,\r\nNo man he seemed to know;\r\nAnd bowing with a mighty look\r\nAt me, the sea withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XX.\r\n\r\n  OLD-FASHIONED.\r\n\r\nArcturus is his other name, --\r\nI\'d rather call him star!\r\nIt\'s so unkind of science\r\nTo go and interfere!\r\n\r\nI pull a flower from the woods, --\r\nA monster with a glass\r\nComputes the stamens in a breath,\r\nAnd has her in a class.\r\n\r\nWhereas I took the butterfly\r\nAforetime in my hat,\r\nHe sits erect in cabinets,\r\nThe clover-bells forgot.\r\n\r\nWhat once was heaven, is zenith now.\r\nWhere I proposed to go\r\nWhen time\'s brief masquerade was done,\r\nIs mapped, and charted too!\r\n\r\nWhat if the poles should frisk about\r\nAnd stand upon their heads!\r\nI hope I \'m ready for the worst,\r\nWhatever prank betides!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the kingdom of Heaven \'s changed!\r\nI hope the children there\r\nWon\'t be new-fashioned when I come,\r\nAnd laugh at me, and stare!\r\n\r\nI hope the father in the skies\r\nWill lift his little girl, --\r\nOld-fashioned, naughty, everything, --\r\nOver the stile of pearl!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXI.\r\n\r\n     A TEMPEST.\r\n\r\nAn awful tempest mashed the air,\r\nThe clouds were gaunt and few;\r\nA black, as of a spectre\'s cloak,\r\nHid heaven and earth from view.\r\n\r\nThe creatures chuckled on the roofs\r\nAnd whistled in the air,\r\nAnd shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.\r\nAnd swung their frenzied hair.\r\n\r\nThe morning lit, the birds arose;\r\nThe monster\'s faded eyes\r\nTurned slowly to his native coast,\r\nAnd peace was Paradise!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXII.\r\n\r\n      THE SEA.\r\n\r\nAn everywhere of silver,\r\nWith ropes of sand\r\nTo keep it from effacing\r\nThe track called land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIII.\r\n\r\n    IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\nA bird came down the walk:\r\nHe did not know I saw;\r\nHe bit an angle-worm in halves\r\nAnd ate the fellow, raw.\r\n\r\nAnd then he drank a dew\r\nFrom a convenient grass,\r\nAnd then hopped sidewise to the wall\r\nTo let a beetle pass.\r\n\r\nHe glanced with rapid eyes\r\nThat hurried all abroad, --\r\nThey looked like frightened beads, I thought;\r\nHe stirred his velvet head\r\n\r\nLike one in danger; cautious,\r\nI offered him a crumb,\r\nAnd he unrolled his feathers\r\nAnd rowed him softer home\r\n\r\nThan oars divide the ocean,\r\nToo silver for a seam,\r\nOr butterflies, off banks of noon,\r\nLeap, splashless, as they swim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIV.\r\n\r\n     THE SNAKE.\r\n\r\nA narrow fellow in the grass\r\nOccasionally rides;\r\nYou may have met him, -- did you not,\r\nHis notice sudden is.\r\n\r\nThe grass divides as with a comb,\r\nA spotted shaft is seen;\r\nAnd then it closes at your feet\r\nAnd opens further on.\r\n\r\nHe likes a boggy acre,\r\nA floor too cool for corn.\r\nYet when a child, and barefoot,\r\nI more than once, at morn,\r\n\r\nHave passed, I thought, a whip-lash\r\nUnbraiding in the sun, --\r\nWhen, stooping to secure it,\r\nIt wrinkled, and was gone.\r\n\r\nSeveral of nature\'s people\r\nI know, and they know me;\r\nI feel for them a transport\r\nOf cordiality;\r\n\r\nBut never met this fellow,\r\nAttended or alone,\r\nWithout a tighter breathing,\r\nAnd zero at the bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXV.\r\n\r\n   THE MUSHROOM.\r\n\r\nThe mushroom is the elf of plants,\r\nAt evening it is not;\r\nAt morning in a truffled hut\r\nIt stops upon a spot\r\n\r\nAs if it tarried always;\r\nAnd yet its whole career\r\nIs shorter than a snake\'s delay,\r\nAnd fleeter than a tare.\r\n\r\n\'T is vegetation\'s juggler,\r\nThe germ of alibi;\r\nDoth like a bubble antedate,\r\nAnd like a bubble hie.\r\n\r\nI feel as if the grass were pleased\r\nTo have it intermit;\r\nThe surreptitious scion\r\nOf summer\'s circumspect.\r\n\r\nHad nature any outcast face,\r\nCould she a son contemn,\r\nHad nature an Iscariot,\r\nThat mushroom, -- it is him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVI.\r\n\r\n     THE STORM.\r\n\r\nThere came a wind like a bugle;\r\nIt quivered through the grass,\r\nAnd a green chill upon the heat\r\nSo ominous did pass\r\nWe barred the windows and the doors\r\nAs from an emerald ghost;\r\nThe doom\'s electric moccason\r\nThat very instant passed.\r\nOn a strange mob of panting trees,\r\nAnd fences fled away,\r\nAnd rivers where the houses ran\r\nThe living looked that day.\r\nThe bell within the steeple wild\r\nThe flying tidings whirled.\r\nHow much can come\r\nAnd much can go,\r\nAnd yet abide the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVII.\r\n\r\n     THE SPIDER.\r\n\r\nA spider sewed at night\r\nWithout a light\r\nUpon an arc of white.\r\nIf ruff it was of dame\r\nOr shroud of gnome,\r\nHimself, himself inform.\r\nOf immortality\r\nHis strategy\r\nWas physiognomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVIII.\r\n\r\nI know a place where summer strives\r\nWith such a practised frost,\r\nShe each year leads her daisies back,\r\nRecording briefly, "Lost."\r\n\r\nBut when the south wind stirs the pools\r\nAnd struggles in the lanes,\r\nHer heart misgives her for her vow,\r\nAnd she pours soft refrains\r\n\r\nInto the lap of adamant,\r\nAnd spices, and the dew,\r\nThat stiffens quietly to quartz,\r\nUpon her amber shoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIX.\r\n\r\nThe one that could repeat the summer day\r\nWere greater than itself, though he\r\nMinutest of mankind might be.\r\nAnd who could reproduce the sun,\r\nAt period of going down --\r\nThe lingering and the stain, I mean --\r\nWhen Orient has been outgrown,\r\nAnd Occident becomes unknown,\r\nHis name remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXX.\r\n\r\n  THE WIND\'S VISIT.\r\n\r\nThe wind tapped like a tired man,\r\nAnd like a host, "Come in,"\r\nI boldly answered; entered then\r\nMy residence within\r\n\r\nA rapid, footless guest,\r\nTo offer whom a chair\r\nWere as impossible as hand\r\nA sofa to the air.\r\n\r\nNo bone had he to bind him,\r\nHis speech was like the push\r\nOf numerous humming-birds at once\r\nFrom a superior bush.\r\n\r\nHis countenance a billow,\r\nHis fingers, if he pass,\r\nLet go a music, as of tunes\r\nBlown tremulous in glass.\r\n\r\nHe visited, still flitting;\r\nThen, like a timid man,\r\nAgain he tapped -- \'t was flurriedly --\r\nAnd I became alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXI.\r\n\r\nNature rarer uses yellow\r\n   Than another hue;\r\nSaves she all of that for sunsets, --\r\n   Prodigal of blue,\r\n\r\nSpending scarlet like a woman,\r\n   Yellow she affords\r\nOnly scantly and selectly,\r\n   Like a lover\'s words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXII.\r\n\r\n       GOSSIP.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, like women, interchange\r\n  Sagacious confidence;\r\nSomewhat of nods, and somewhat of\r\n  Portentous inference,\r\n\r\nThe parties in both cases\r\n  Enjoining secrecy, --\r\nInviolable compact\r\n  To notoriety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIII.\r\n\r\n      SIMPLICITY.\r\n\r\nHow happy is the little stone\r\nThat rambles in the road alone,\r\nAnd does n\'t care about careers,\r\nAnd exigencies never fears;\r\nWhose coat of elemental brown\r\nA passing universe put on;\r\nAnd independent as the sun,\r\nAssociates or glows alone,\r\nFulfilling absolute decree\r\nIn casual simplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIV.\r\n\r\n        STORM.\r\n\r\nIt sounded as if the streets were running,\r\nAnd then the streets stood still.\r\nEclipse was all we could see at the window,\r\nAnd awe was all we could feel.\r\n\r\nBy and by the boldest stole out of his covert,\r\nTo see if time was there.\r\nNature was in her beryl apron,\r\nMixing fresher air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXV.\r\n\r\n       THE RAT.\r\n\r\nThe rat is the concisest tenant.\r\nHe pays no rent, --\r\nRepudiates the obligation,\r\nOn schemes intent.\r\n\r\nBalking our wit\r\nTo sound or circumvent,\r\nHate cannot harm\r\nA foe so reticent.\r\n\r\nNeither decree\r\nProhibits him,\r\nLawful as\r\nEquilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVI.\r\n\r\nFrequently the woods are pink,\r\nFrequently are brown;\r\nFrequently the hills undress\r\nBehind my native town.\r\n\r\nOft a head is crested\r\nI was wont to see,\r\nAnd as oft a cranny\r\nWhere it used to be.\r\n\r\nAnd the earth, they tell me,\r\nOn its axis turned, --\r\nWonderful rotation\r\nBy but twelve performed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVII.\r\n\r\n    A THUNDER-STORM.\r\n\r\nThe wind begun to rock the grass\r\nWith threatening tunes and low, --\r\nHe flung a menace at the earth,\r\nA menace at the sky.\r\n\r\nThe leaves unhooked themselves from trees\r\nAnd started all abroad;\r\nThe dust did scoop itself like hands\r\nAnd throw away the road.\r\n\r\nThe wagons quickened on the streets,\r\nThe thunder hurried slow;\r\nThe lightning showed a yellow beak,\r\nAnd then a livid claw.\r\n\r\nThe birds put up the bars to nests,\r\nThe cattle fled to barns;\r\nThere came one drop of giant rain,\r\nAnd then, as if the hands\r\n\r\nThat held the dams had parted hold,\r\nThe waters wrecked the sky,\r\nBut overlooked my father\'s house,\r\nJust quartering a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n     WITH FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nSouth winds jostle them,\r\nBumblebees come,\r\nHover, hesitate,\r\nDrink, and are gone.\r\n\r\nButterflies pause\r\nOn their passage Cashmere;\r\nI, softly plucking,\r\nPresent them here!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIX.\r\n\r\n        SUNSET.\r\n\r\nWhere ships of purple gently toss\r\nOn seas of daffodil,\r\nFantastic sailors mingle,\r\nAnd then -- the wharf is still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XL.\r\n\r\nShe sweeps with many-colored brooms,\r\nAnd leaves the shreds behind;\r\nOh, housewife in the evening west,\r\nCome back, and dust the pond!\r\n\r\nYou dropped a purple ravelling in,\r\nYou dropped an amber thread;\r\nAnd now you \'ve littered all the East\r\nWith duds of emerald!\r\n\r\nAnd still she plies her spotted brooms,\r\nAnd still the aprons fly,\r\nTill brooms fade softly into stars --\r\nAnd then I come away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLI.\r\n\r\nLike mighty footlights burned the red\r\nAt bases of the trees, --\r\nThe far theatricals of day\r\nExhibiting to these.\r\n\r\n\'T was universe that did applaud\r\nWhile, chiefest of the crowd,\r\nEnabled by his royal dress,\r\nMyself distinguished God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLII.\r\n\r\n      PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\nBring me the sunset in a cup,\r\nReckon the morning\'s flagons up,\r\n   And say how many dew;\r\nTell me how far the morning leaps,\r\nTell me what time the weaver sleeps\r\n   Who spun the breadths of blue!\r\n\r\nWrite me how many notes there be\r\nIn the new robin\'s ecstasy\r\n   Among astonished boughs;\r\nHow many trips the tortoise makes,\r\nHow many cups the bee partakes, --\r\n   The debauchee of dews!\r\n\r\nAlso, who laid the rainbow\'s piers,\r\nAlso, who leads the docile spheres\r\n   By withes of supple blue?\r\nWhose fingers string the stalactite,\r\nWho counts the wampum of the night,\r\n   To see that none is due?\r\n\r\nWho built this little Alban house\r\nAnd shut the windows down so close\r\n   My spirit cannot see?\r\nWho \'ll let me out some gala day,\r\nWith implements to fly away,\r\n   Passing pomposity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLIII.\r\n\r\n  THE JUGGLER OF DAY.\r\n\r\nBlazing in gold and quenching in purple,\r\nLeaping like leopards to the sky,\r\nThen at the feet of the old horizon\r\nLaying her spotted face, to die;\r\n\r\nStooping as low as the otter\'s window,\r\nTouching the roof and tinting the barn,\r\nKissing her bonnet to the meadow, --\r\nAnd the juggler of day is gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLIV.\r\n\r\n     MY CRICKET.\r\n\r\nFarther in summer than the birds,\r\nPathetic from the grass,\r\nA minor nation celebrates\r\nIts unobtrusive mass.\r\n\r\nNo ordinance is seen,\r\nSo gradual the grace,\r\nA pensive custom it becomes,\r\nEnlarging loneliness.\r\n\r\nAntiquest felt at noon\r\nWhen August, burning low,\r\nCalls forth this spectral canticle,\r\nRepose to typify.\r\n\r\nRemit as yet no grace,\r\nNo furrow on the glow,\r\nYet a druidic difference\r\nEnhances nature now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLV.\r\n\r\nAs imperceptibly as grief\r\nThe summer lapsed away, --\r\nToo imperceptible, at last,\r\nTo seem like perfidy.\r\n\r\nA quietness distilled,\r\nAs twilight long begun,\r\nOr Nature, spending with herself\r\nSequestered afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe dusk drew earlier in,\r\nThe morning foreign shone, --\r\nA courteous, yet harrowing grace,\r\nAs guest who would be gone.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, without a wing,\r\nOr service of a keel,\r\nOur summer made her light escape\r\nInto the beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLVI.\r\n\r\nIt can\'t be summer, -- that got through;\r\nIt \'s early yet for spring;\r\nThere \'s that long town of white to cross\r\nBefore the blackbirds sing.\r\n\r\nIt can\'t be dying, -- it\'s too rouge, --\r\nThe dead shall go in white.\r\nSo sunset shuts my question down\r\nWith clasps of chrysolite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLVII.\r\n\r\n  SUMMER\'S OBSEQUIES.\r\n\r\nThe gentian weaves her fringes,\r\nThe maple\'s loom is red.\r\nMy departing blossoms\r\nObviate parade.\r\n\r\nA brief, but patient illness,\r\nAn hour to prepare;\r\nAnd one, below this morning,\r\nIs where the angels are.\r\n\r\nIt was a short procession, --\r\nThe bobolink was there,\r\nAn aged bee addressed us,\r\nAnd then we knelt in prayer.\r\n\r\nWe trust that she was willing, --\r\nWe ask that we may be.\r\nSummer, sister, seraph,\r\nLet us go with thee!\r\n\r\nIn the name of the bee\r\nAnd of the butterfly\r\nAnd of the breeze, amen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLVIII.\r\n\r\n   FRINGED GENTIAN.\r\n\r\nGod made a little gentian;\r\nIt tried to be a rose\r\nAnd failed, and all the summer laughed.\r\nBut just before the snows\r\nThere came a purple creature\r\nThat ravished all the hill;\r\nAnd summer hid her forehead,\r\nAnd mockery was still.\r\nThe frosts were her condition;\r\nThe Tyrian would not come\r\nUntil the North evoked it.\r\n"Creator! shall I bloom?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLIX.\r\n\r\n      NOVEMBER.\r\n\r\nBesides the autumn poets sing,\r\nA few prosaic days\r\nA little this side of the snow\r\nAnd that side of the haze.\r\n\r\nA few incisive mornings,\r\nA few ascetic eyes, --\r\nGone Mr. Bryant\'s golden-rod,\r\nAnd Mr. Thomson\'s sheaves.\r\n\r\nStill is the bustle in the brook,\r\nSealed are the spicy valves;\r\nMesmeric fingers softly touch\r\nThe eyes of many elves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a squirrel may remain,\r\nMy sentiments to share.\r\nGrant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,\r\nThy windy will to bear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        L.\r\n\r\n    THE SNOW.\r\n\r\nIt sifts from leaden sieves,\r\nIt powders all the wood,\r\nIt fills with alabaster wool\r\nThe wrinkles of the road.\r\n\r\nIt makes an even face\r\nOf mountain and of plain, --\r\nUnbroken forehead from the east\r\nUnto the east again.\r\n\r\nIt reaches to the fence,\r\nIt wraps it, rail by rail,\r\nTill it is lost in fleeces;\r\nIt flings a crystal veil\r\n\r\nOn stump and stack and stem, --\r\nThe summer\'s empty room,\r\nAcres of seams where harvests were,\r\nRecordless, but for them.\r\n\r\nIt ruffles wrists of posts,\r\nAs ankles of a queen, --\r\nThen stills its artisans like ghosts,\r\nDenying they have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        LI.\r\n\r\n   THE BLUE JAY.\r\n\r\nNo brigadier throughout the year\r\nSo civic as the jay.\r\nA neighbor and a warrior too,\r\nWith shrill felicity\r\n\r\nPursuing winds that censure us\r\nA February day,\r\nThe brother of the universe\r\nWas never blown away.\r\n\r\nThe snow and he are intimate;\r\nI \'ve often seen them play\r\nWhen heaven looked upon us all\r\nWith such severity,\r\n\r\nI felt apology were due\r\nTo an insulted sky,\r\nWhose pompous frown was nutriment\r\nTo their temerity.\r\n\r\nThe pillow of this daring head\r\nIs pungent evergreens;\r\nHis larder -- terse and militant --\r\nUnknown, refreshing things;\r\n\r\nHis character a tonic,\r\nHis future a dispute;\r\nUnfair an immortality\r\nThat leaves this neighbor out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    IV.\r\n\r\n             TIME AND ETERNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        I.\r\n\r\nLet down the bars, O Death!\r\nThe tired flocks come in\r\nWhose bleating ceases to repeat,\r\nWhose wandering is done.\r\n\r\nThine is the stillest night,\r\nThine the securest fold;\r\nToo near thou art for seeking thee,\r\nToo tender to be told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        II.\r\n\r\nGoing to heaven!\r\nI don\'t know when,\r\nPray do not ask me how, --\r\nIndeed, I \'m too astonished\r\nTo think of answering you!\r\nGoing to heaven! --\r\nHow dim it sounds!\r\nAnd yet it will be done\r\nAs sure as flocks go home at night\r\nUnto the shepherd\'s arm!\r\n\r\nPerhaps you \'re going too!\r\nWho knows?\r\nIf you should get there first,\r\nSave just a little place for me\r\nClose to the two I lost!\r\n\r\nThe smallest "robe" will fit me,\r\nAnd just a bit of "crown;"\r\nFor you know we do not mind our dress\r\nWhen we are going home.\r\n\r\nI \'m glad I don\'t believe it,\r\nFor it would stop my breath,\r\nAnd I \'d like to look a little more\r\nAt such a curious earth!\r\nI am glad they did believe it\r\nWhom I have never found\r\nSince the mighty autumn afternoon\r\nI left them in the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        III.\r\n\r\nAt least to pray is left, is left.\r\nO Jesus! in the air\r\nI know not which thy chamber is, --\r\nI \'m knocking everywhere.\r\n\r\nThou stirrest earthquake in the South,\r\nAnd maelstrom in the sea;\r\nSay, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\r\nHast thou no arm for me?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        IV.\r\n\r\n     EPITAPH.\r\n\r\nStep lightly on this narrow spot!\r\nThe broadest land that grows\r\nIs not so ample as the breast\r\nThese emerald seams enclose.\r\n\r\nStep lofty; for this name is told\r\nAs far as cannon dwell,\r\nOr flag subsist, or fame export\r\nHer deathless syllable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        V.\r\n\r\nMorns like these we parted;\r\nNoons like these she rose,\r\nFluttering first, then firmer,\r\nTo her fair repose.\r\n\r\nNever did she lisp it,\r\nAnd \'t was not for me;\r\nShe was mute from transport,\r\nI, from agony!\r\n\r\nTill the evening, nearing,\r\nOne the shutters drew --\r\nQuick! a sharper rustling!\r\nAnd this linnet flew!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        VI.\r\n\r\nA death-blow is a life-blow to some\r\nWho, till they died, did not alive become;\r\nWho, had they lived, had died, but when\r\nThey died, vitality begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        VII.\r\n\r\nI read my sentence steadily,\r\nReviewed it with my eyes,\r\nTo see that I made no mistake\r\nIn its extremest clause, --\r\n\r\nThe date, and manner of the shame;\r\nAnd then the pious form\r\nThat "God have mercy" on the soul\r\nThe jury voted him.\r\n\r\nI made my soul familiar\r\nWith her extremity,\r\nThat at the last it should not be\r\nA novel agony,\r\n\r\nBut she and Death, acquainted,\r\nMeet tranquilly as friends,\r\nSalute and pass without a hint --\r\nAnd there the matter ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        VIII.\r\n\r\nI have not told my garden yet,\r\nLest that should conquer me;\r\nI have not quite the strength now\r\nTo break it to the bee.\r\n\r\nI will not name it in the street,\r\nFor shops would stare, that I,\r\nSo shy, so very ignorant,\r\nShould have the face to die.\r\n\r\nThe hillsides must not know it,\r\nWhere I have rambled so,\r\nNor tell the loving forests\r\nThe day that I shall go,\r\n\r\nNor lisp it at the table,\r\nNor heedless by the way\r\nHint that within the riddle\r\nOne will walk to-day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        IX.\r\n\r\n THE BATTLE-FIELD.\r\n\r\nThey dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,\r\n   Like petals from a rose,\r\nWhen suddenly across the June\r\n   A wind with fingers goes.\r\n\r\nThey perished in the seamless grass, --\r\n   No eye could find the place;\r\nBut God on his repealless list\r\n   Can summon every face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        X.\r\n\r\nThe only ghost I ever saw\r\nWas dressed in mechlin, -- so;\r\nHe wore no sandal on his foot,\r\nAnd stepped like flakes of snow.\r\nHis gait was soundless, like the bird,\r\nBut rapid, like the roe;\r\nHis fashions quaint, mosaic,\r\nOr, haply, mistletoe.\r\n\r\nHis conversation seldom,\r\nHis laughter like the breeze\r\nThat dies away in dimples\r\nAmong the pensive trees.\r\nOur interview was transient,--\r\nOf me, himself was shy;\r\nAnd God forbid I look behind\r\nSince that appalling day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XI.\r\n\r\nSome, too fragile for winter winds,\r\nThe thoughtful grave encloses, --\r\nTenderly tucking them in from frost\r\nBefore their feet are cold.\r\n\r\nNever the treasures in her nest\r\nThe cautious grave exposes,\r\nBuilding where schoolboy dare not look\r\nAnd sportsman is not bold.\r\n\r\nThis covert have all the children\r\nEarly aged, and often cold, --\r\nSparrows unnoticed by the Father;\r\nLambs for whom time had not a fold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XII.\r\n\r\nAs by the dead we love to sit,\r\nBecome so wondrous dear,\r\nAs for the lost we grapple,\r\nThough all the rest are here, --\r\n\r\nIn broken mathematics\r\nWe estimate our prize,\r\nVast, in its fading ratio,\r\nTo our penurious eyes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XIII.\r\n\r\n      MEMORIALS.\r\n\r\nDeath sets a thing significant\r\nThe eye had hurried by,\r\nExcept a perished creature\r\nEntreat us tenderly\r\n\r\nTo ponder little workmanships\r\nIn crayon or in wool,\r\nWith "This was last her fingers did,"\r\nIndustrious until\r\n\r\nThe thimble weighed too heavy,\r\nThe stitches stopped themselves,\r\nAnd then \'t was put among the dust\r\nUpon the closet shelves.\r\n\r\nA book I have, a friend gave,\r\nWhose pencil, here and there,\r\nHad notched the place that pleased him, --\r\nAt rest his fingers are.\r\n\r\nNow, when I read, I read not,\r\nFor interrupting tears\r\nObliterate the etchings\r\nToo costly for repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XIV.\r\n\r\nI went to heaven, --\r\n\'T was a small town,\r\nLit with a ruby,\r\nLathed with down.\r\nStiller than the fields\r\nAt the full dew,\r\nBeautiful as pictures\r\nNo man drew.\r\nPeople like the moth,\r\nOf mechlin, frames,\r\nDuties of gossamer,\r\nAnd eider names.\r\nAlmost contented\r\nI could be\r\n\'Mong such unique\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XV.\r\n\r\nTheir height in heaven comforts not,\r\nTheir glory nought to me;\r\n\'T was best imperfect, as it was;\r\nI \'m finite, I can\'t see.\r\n\r\nThe house of supposition,\r\nThe glimmering frontier\r\nThat skirts the acres of perhaps,\r\nTo me shows insecure.\r\n\r\nThe wealth I had contented me;\r\nIf \'t was a meaner size,\r\nThen I had counted it until\r\nIt pleased my narrow eyes\r\n\r\nBetter than larger values,\r\nHowever true their show;\r\nThis timid life of evidence\r\nKeeps pleading, "I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XVI.\r\n\r\nThere is a shame of nobleness\r\nConfronting sudden pelf, --\r\nA finer shame of ecstasy\r\nConvicted of itself.\r\n\r\nA best disgrace a brave man feels,\r\nAcknowledged of the brave, --\r\nOne more "Ye Blessed" to be told;\r\nBut this involves the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XVII.\r\n\r\n      TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\nTriumph may be of several kinds.\r\nThere \'s triumph in the room\r\nWhen that old imperator, Death,\r\nBy faith is overcome.\r\n\r\nThere \'s triumph of the finer mind\r\nWhen truth, affronted long,\r\nAdvances calm to her supreme,\r\nHer God her only throng.\r\n\r\nA triumph when temptation\'s bribe\r\nIs slowly handed back,\r\nOne eye upon the heaven renounced\r\nAnd one upon the rack.\r\n\r\nSeverer triumph, by himself\r\nExperienced, who can pass\r\nAcquitted from that naked bar,\r\nJehovah\'s countenance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XVIII.\r\n\r\nPompless no life can pass away;\r\n    The lowliest career\r\nTo the same pageant wends its way\r\n    As that exalted here.\r\nHow cordial is the mystery!\r\n    The hospitable pall\r\nA "this way" beckons spaciously, --\r\n    A miracle for all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XIX.\r\n\r\nI noticed people disappeared,\r\nWhen but a little child, --\r\nSupposed they visited remote,\r\nOr settled regions wild.\r\n\r\nNow know I they both visited\r\nAnd settled regions wild,\r\nBut did because they died, -- a fact\r\nWithheld the little child!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XX.\r\n\r\n    FOLLOWING.\r\n\r\nI had no cause to be awake,\r\nMy best was gone to sleep,\r\nAnd morn a new politeness took,\r\nAnd failed to wake them up,\r\n\r\nBut called the others clear,\r\nAnd passed their curtains by.\r\nSweet morning, when I over-sleep,\r\nKnock, recollect, for me!\r\n\r\nI looked at sunrise once,\r\nAnd then I looked at them,\r\nAnd wishfulness in me arose\r\nFor circumstance the same.\r\n\r\n\'T was such an ample peace,\r\nIt could not hold a sigh, --\r\n\'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,\r\n\'T was sunset all the day.\r\n\r\nSo choosing but a gown\r\nAnd taking but a prayer,\r\nThe only raiment I should need,\r\nI struggled, and was there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXI.\r\n\r\nIf anybody\'s friend be dead,\r\nIt \'s sharpest of the theme\r\nThe thinking how they walked alive,\r\nAt such and such a time.\r\n\r\nTheir costume, of a Sunday,\r\nSome manner of the hair, --\r\nA prank nobody knew but them,\r\nLost, in the sepulchre.\r\n\r\nHow warm they were on such a day:\r\nYou almost feel the date,\r\nSo short way off it seems; and now,\r\nThey \'re centuries from that.\r\n\r\nHow pleased they were at what you said;\r\nYou try to touch the smile,\r\nAnd dip your fingers in the frost:\r\nWhen was it, can you tell,\r\n\r\nYou asked the company to tea,\r\nAcquaintance, just a few,\r\nAnd chatted close with this grand thing\r\nThat don\'t remember you?\r\n\r\nPast bows and invitations,\r\nPast interview, and vow,\r\nPast what ourselves can estimate, --\r\nThat makes the quick of woe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXII.\r\n\r\n    THE JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nOur journey had advanced;\r\nOur feet were almost come\r\nTo that odd fork in Being\'s road,\r\nEternity by term.\r\n\r\nOur pace took sudden awe,\r\nOur feet reluctant led.\r\nBefore were cities, but between,\r\nThe forest of the dead.\r\n\r\nRetreat was out of hope, --\r\nBehind, a sealed route,\r\nEternity\'s white flag before,\r\nAnd God at every gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIII.\r\n\r\n  A COUNTRY BURIAL.\r\n\r\nAmple make this bed.\r\nMake this bed with awe;\r\nIn it wait till judgment break\r\nExcellent and fair.\r\n\r\nBe its mattress straight,\r\nBe its pillow round;\r\nLet no sunrise\' yellow noise\r\nInterrupt this ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIV.\r\n\r\n       GOING.\r\n\r\nOn such a night, or such a night,\r\nWould anybody care\r\nIf such a little figure\r\nSlipped quiet from its chair,\r\n\r\nSo quiet, oh, how quiet!\r\nThat nobody might know\r\nBut that the little figure\r\nRocked softer, to and fro?\r\n\r\nOn such a dawn, or such a dawn,\r\nWould anybody sigh\r\nThat such a little figure\r\nToo sound asleep did lie\r\n\r\nFor chanticleer to wake it, --\r\nOr stirring house below,\r\nOr giddy bird in orchard,\r\nOr early task to do?\r\n\r\nThere was a little figure plump\r\nFor every little knoll,\r\nBusy needles, and spools of thread,\r\nAnd trudging feet from school.\r\n\r\nPlaymates, and holidays, and nuts,\r\nAnd visions vast and small.\r\nStrange that the feet so precious charged\r\nShould reach so small a goal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXV.\r\n\r\nEssential oils are wrung:\r\nThe attar from the rose\r\nIs not expressed by suns alone,\r\nIt is the gift of screws.\r\n\r\nThe general rose decays;\r\nBut this, in lady\'s drawer,\r\nMakes summer when the lady lies\r\nIn ceaseless rosemary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVI.\r\n\r\nI lived on dread; to those who know\r\nThe stimulus there is\r\nIn danger, other impetus\r\nIs numb and vital-less.\r\n\r\nAs \'t were a spur upon the soul,\r\nA fear will urge it where\r\nTo go without the spectre\'s aid\r\nWere challenging despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVII.\r\n\r\nIf I should die,\r\nAnd you should live,\r\nAnd time should gurgle on,\r\nAnd morn should beam,\r\nAnd noon should burn,\r\nAs it has usual done;\r\nIf birds should build as early,\r\nAnd bees as bustling go, --\r\nOne might depart at option\r\nFrom enterprise below!\r\n\'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand\r\nWhen we with daisies lie,\r\nThat commerce will continue,\r\nAnd trades as briskly fly.\r\nIt makes the parting tranquil\r\nAnd keeps the soul serene,\r\nThat gentlemen so sprightly\r\nConduct the pleasing scene!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXVIII.\r\n\r\n       AT LENGTH.\r\n\r\nHer final summer was it,\r\nAnd yet we guessed it not;\r\nIf tenderer industriousness\r\nPervaded her, we thought\r\n\r\nA further force of life\r\nDeveloped from within, --\r\nWhen Death lit all the shortness up,\r\nAnd made the hurry plain.\r\n\r\nWe wondered at our blindness, --\r\nWhen nothing was to see\r\nBut her Carrara guide-post, --\r\nAt our stupidity,\r\n\r\nWhen, duller than our dulness,\r\nThe busy darling lay,\r\nSo busy was she, finishing,\r\nSo leisurely were we!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXIX.\r\n\r\n       GHOSTS.\r\n\r\nOne need not be a chamber to be haunted,\r\nOne need not be a house;\r\nThe brain has corridors surpassing\r\nMaterial place.\r\n\r\nFar safer, of a midnight meeting\r\nExternal ghost,\r\nThan an interior confronting\r\nThat whiter host.\r\n\r\nFar safer through an Abbey gallop,\r\nThe stones achase,\r\nThan, moonless, one\'s own self encounter\r\nIn lonesome place.\r\n\r\nOurself, behind ourself concealed,\r\nShould startle most;\r\nAssassin, hid in our apartment,\r\nBe horror\'s least.\r\n\r\nThe prudent carries a revolver,\r\nHe bolts the door,\r\nO\'erlooking a superior spectre\r\nMore near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXX.\r\n\r\n     VANISHED.\r\n\r\nShe died, -- this was the way she died;\r\nAnd when her breath was done,\r\nTook up her simple wardrobe\r\nAnd started for the sun.\r\n\r\nHer little figure at the gate\r\nThe angels must have spied,\r\nSince I could never find her\r\nUpon the mortal side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXI.\r\n\r\n     PRECEDENCE.\r\n\r\nWait till the majesty of Death\r\nInvests so mean a brow!\r\nAlmost a powdered footman\r\nMight dare to touch it now!\r\n\r\nWait till in everlasting robes\r\nThis democrat is dressed,\r\nThen prate about "preferment"\r\nAnd "station" and the rest!\r\n\r\nAround this quiet courtier\r\nObsequious angels wait!\r\nFull royal is his retinue,\r\nFull purple is his state!\r\n\r\nA lord might dare to lift the hat\r\nTo such a modest clay,\r\nSince that my Lord, "the Lord of lords"\r\nReceives unblushingly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXII.\r\n\r\n        GONE.\r\n\r\nWent up a year this evening!\r\nI recollect it well!\r\nAmid no bells nor bravos\r\nThe bystanders will tell!\r\nCheerful, as to the village,\r\nTranquil, as to repose,\r\nChastened, as to the chapel,\r\nThis humble tourist rose.\r\nDid not talk of returning,\r\nAlluded to no time\r\nWhen, were the gales propitious,\r\nWe might look for him;\r\nWas grateful for the roses\r\nIn life\'s diverse bouquet,\r\nTalked softly of new species\r\nTo pick another day.\r\n\r\nBeguiling thus the wonder,\r\nThe wondrous nearer drew;\r\nHands bustled at the moorings --\r\nThe crowd respectful grew.\r\nAscended from our vision\r\nTo countenances new!\r\nA difference, a daisy,\r\nIs all the rest I knew!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIII.\r\n\r\n       REQUIEM.\r\n\r\nTaken from men this morning,\r\nCarried by men to-day,\r\nMet by the gods with banners\r\nWho marshalled her away.\r\n\r\nOne little maid from playmates,\r\nOne little mind from school, --\r\nThere must be guests in Eden;\r\nAll the rooms are full.\r\n\r\nFar as the east from even,\r\nDim as the border star, --\r\nCourtiers quaint, in kingdoms,\r\nOur departed are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIV.\r\n\r\nWhat inn is this\r\nWhere for the night\r\nPeculiar traveller comes?\r\nWho is the landlord?\r\nWhere the maids?\r\nBehold, what curious rooms!\r\nNo ruddy fires on the hearth,\r\nNo brimming tankards flow.\r\nNecromancer, landlord,\r\nWho are these below?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXV.\r\n\r\nIt was not death, for I stood up,\r\nAnd all the dead lie down;\r\nIt was not night, for all the bells\r\nPut out their tongues, for noon.\r\n\r\nIt was not frost, for on my flesh\r\nI felt siroccos crawl, --\r\nNor fire, for just my marble feet\r\nCould keep a chancel cool.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it tasted like them all;\r\nThe figures I have seen\r\nSet orderly, for burial,\r\nReminded me of mine,\r\n\r\nAs if my life were shaven\r\nAnd fitted to a frame,\r\nAnd could not breathe without a key;\r\nAnd \'t was like midnight, some,\r\n\r\nWhen everything that ticked has stopped,\r\nAnd space stares, all around,\r\nOr grisly frosts, first autumn morns,\r\nRepeal the beating ground.\r\n\r\nBut most like chaos, -- stopless, cool, --\r\nWithout a chance or spar,\r\nOr even a report of land\r\nTo justify despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVI.\r\n\r\n     TILL THE END.\r\n\r\nI should not dare to leave my friend,\r\nBecause -- because if he should die\r\nWhile I was gone, and I -- too late --\r\nShould reach the heart that wanted me;\r\n\r\nIf I should disappoint the eyes\r\nThat hunted, hunted so, to see,\r\nAnd could not bear to shut until\r\nThey "noticed" me -- they noticed me;\r\n\r\nIf I should stab the patient faith\r\nSo sure I \'d come -- so sure I \'d come,\r\nIt listening, listening, went to sleep\r\nTelling my tardy name, --\r\n\r\nMy heart would wish it broke before,\r\nSince breaking then, since breaking then,\r\nWere useless as next morning\'s sun,\r\nWhere midnight frosts had lain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVII.\r\n\r\n         VOID.\r\n\r\nGreat streets of silence led away\r\nTo neighborhoods of pause;\r\nHere was no notice, no dissent,\r\nNo universe, no laws.\r\n\r\nBy clocks \'t was morning, and for night\r\nThe bells at distance called;\r\nBut epoch had no basis here,\r\nFor period exhaled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nA throe upon the features\r\nA hurry in the breath,\r\nAn ecstasy of parting\r\nDenominated "Death," --\r\n\r\nAn anguish at the mention,\r\nWhich, when to patience grown,\r\nI \'ve known permission given\r\nTo rejoin its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XXXIX.\r\n\r\n        SAVED!\r\n\r\nOf tribulation these are they\r\nDenoted by the white;\r\nThe spangled gowns, a lesser rank\r\nOf victors designate.\r\n\r\nAll these did conquer; but the ones\r\nWho overcame most times\r\nWear nothing commoner than snow,\r\nNo ornament but palms.\r\n\r\nSurrender is a sort unknown\r\nOn this superior soil;\r\nDefeat, an outgrown anguish,\r\nRemembered as the mile\r\n\r\nOur panting ankle barely gained\r\nWhen night devoured the road;\r\nBut we stood whispering in the house,\r\nAnd all we said was "Saved"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XL.\r\n\r\nI think just how my shape will rise\r\nWhen I shall be forgiven,\r\nTill hair and eyes and timid head\r\nAre out of sight, in heaven.\r\n\r\nI think just how my lips will weigh\r\nWith shapeless, quivering prayer\r\nThat you, so late, consider me,\r\nThe sparrow of your care.\r\n\r\nI mind me that of anguish sent,\r\nSome drifts were moved away\r\nBefore my simple bosom broke, --\r\nAnd why not this, if they?\r\n\r\nAnd so, until delirious borne\r\nI con that thing, -- "forgiven," --\r\nTill with long fright and longer trust\r\nI drop my heart, unshriven!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLI.\r\n\r\n THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.\r\n\r\nAfter a hundred years\r\nNobody knows the place, --\r\nAgony, that enacted there,\r\nMotionless as peace.\r\n\r\nWeeds triumphant ranged,\r\nStrangers strolled and spelled\r\nAt the lone orthography\r\nOf the elder dead.\r\n\r\nWinds of summer fields\r\nRecollect the way, --\r\nInstinct picking up the key\r\nDropped by memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLII.\r\n\r\nLay this laurel on the one\r\nToo intrinsic for renown.\r\nLaurel! veil your deathless tree, --\r\nHim you chasten, that is he!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg Etext of Poems, by Emily Dickinson,\r\nSecond
