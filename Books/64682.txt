Siena made me,\r\nMaremma unmade me: this he knows who after\r\nbetrothal espoused me with his ring."\r\n\r\n\r\nI was a student at St. Thomas\'s Hospital and the Easter vacation gave me\r\nsix weeks to myself. With my clothes in a gladstone bag and twenty\r\npounds in my pocket I set out. I was twenty. I went to Genoa and Pisa\r\nand then to Florence. Here I took a room in the via Laura, from the\r\nwindow of which I could see the lovely dome of the Cathedral, in the\r\napartment of a widow lady, with a daughter, who offered me board and\r\nlodging (after a good deal of haggling) for four lire a day. I am afraid\r\nthat she did not make a very good thing out of it, since my appetite was\r\nenormous, and I could devour a mountain of macaroni without\r\ninconvenience. She had a vineyard on the Tuscan hills, and my\r\nrecollection is that the Chianti she got from it was the best I have\r\never drunk in Italy. Her daughter gave me an Italian lesson every day.\r\nShe seemed to me then of mature age, but I do not suppose that she was\r\nmore than twenty-six. She had had trouble. Her betrothed, an officer,\r\nhad been killed in Abyssinia and she was consecrated to virginity. It\r\nwas an understood thing that on her mother\'s death (a buxom,\r\ngrey-haired, jovial lady who did not mean to die a day before the dear\r\nLord saw fit) Ersilia would enter religion. But she looked forward to\r\nthis with cheerfulness. She loved a good laugh. We were very gay at\r\nluncheon and dinner, but she took her lessons seriously, and when I was\r\nstupid or inattentive rapped me over the knuckles with a black ruler. I\r\nshould have been indignant at being treated like a child if it had not\r\nreminded me of the old-fashioned pedagogues I had read of in books and\r\nso made me laugh.\r\n\r\nI lived laborious days. I started each one by translating a few pages of\r\none of Ibsen\'s plays so that I might acquire mastery of technique and\r\nease in writing dialogue; then, with Ruskin in my hand, I examined the\r\nsights of Florence. I admired according to instructions the tower of\r\nGiotto and the bronze doors of Ghiberti. I was properly enthusiastic\r\nover the Botticellis in the Uffizi and I turned the scornful shoulder of\r\nextreme youth on what the master disapproved of. After luncheon I had my\r\nItalian lesson and then going out once more I visited the churches and\r\nwandered day-dreaming along the Arno. When dinner was done I went out to\r\nlook for adventure, but such was my innocence, or at least my shyness, I\r\nalways came home as virtuous as I had gone out. The Signora, though she\r\nhad given me a key, sighed with relief when she heard me come in and\r\nbolt the door, for she was always afraid I should forget to do this, and\r\nI returned to my perusal of the history of the Guelphs and Ghibellines.\r\nI was bitterly conscious that not thus behaved the writers of the\r\nromantic era, though I doubt whether any of them managed to spend six\r\nweeks in Italy on twenty pounds, and I much enjoyed my sober and\r\nindustrious life.\r\n\r\nI had already read the Inferno (with the help of a translation, but\r\nconscientiously looking out in a dictionary the words I did not know),\r\nso with Ersilia started on the Purgatorio. When we came to the passage I\r\nhave quoted above she told me that Pia was a gentlewoman of Siena whose\r\nhusband, suspecting her of adultery and afraid on account of her family\r\nto put her to death, took her down to his castle in the Maremma the\r\nnoxious vapours of which he was confident would do the trick; but she\r\ntook so long to die that he grew impatient and had her thrown out of the\r\nwindow. I do not know where Ersilia learnt all this, the note in my own\r\nDante was less circumstantial, but the story for some reason caught my\r\nimagination. I turned it over in my mind and for many years from time to\r\ntime would brood over it for two or three days. I used to repeat to\r\nmyself the line: _Siena mi f\xc3\xa9; disfecemi Maremma_. But it was one among\r\nmany subjects that occupied my fancy and for long periods I forgot it.\r\nOf course I saw it as a modern story, and I could not think of a setting\r\nin the world of to-day in which such events might plausibly happen. It\r\nwas not till I made a long journey in China that I found this.\r\n\r\nI think this is the only novel I have written in which I started from a\r\nstory rather than from a character. It is difficult to explain the\r\nrelation between character and plot. You cannot very well think of a\r\ncharacter in the void; the moment you think of him, you think of him in\r\nsome situation, doing something; so that the character and at least his\r\nprinciple action seem to be the result of a simultaneous act of the\r\nimagination. But in this case the characters were chosen to fit the\r\nstory I gradually evolved; they were constructed from persons I had long\r\nknown in different circumstances.\r\n\r\nI had with this book some of the difficulties that are apt to befall an\r\nauthor. I had originally called my hero and heroine Lane, a common\r\nenough name, but it appeared that there were people of that name in\r\nHong-Kong. They brought an action, which the proprietors of the magazine\r\nin which my novel was serialised, settled for two hundred and fifty\r\npounds, and I changed the name to Fane. Then the Assistant Colonial\r\nSecretary, thinking himself libelled, threatened to institute\r\nproceedings. I was surprised, since in England we can put a Prime\r\nMinister on the stage or use him as the character of a novel, an\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury or a Lord Chancellor, and the tenants of these\r\nexalted offices do not turn a hair. It seemed to me strange that the\r\ntemporary occupant of so insignificant a post should think himself aimed\r\nat, but in order to save trouble I changed Hong-Kong to an imaginary\r\ncolony of Tching-Yen. The book had already been published when the\r\nincident arose and was recalled. A certain number of astute reviewers\r\nwho had received it did not on one pretext and another return their\r\ncopies. These have now acquired a bibliographical value, I think there\r\nare about sixty of them in existence, and are bought by collectors at a\r\nhigh price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAINTED VEIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_i_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe gave a startled cry.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" he asked.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the darkness of the shuttered room he saw her face on a\r\nsudden distraught with terror.\r\n\r\n"Some one just tried the door."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps it was the amah, or one of the boys."\r\n\r\n"They never come at this time. They know I always sleep after tiffin."\r\n\r\n"Who else could it be?"\r\n\r\n"Walter," she whispered, her lips trembling.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to his shoes. He tried to put them on, but his nervousness,\r\nfor her alarm was affecting him, made him clumsy, and besides, they were\r\non the tight side. With a faint gasp of impatience she gave him a\r\nshoe-horn. She slipped into a kimono and in her bare feet went over to\r\nher dressing-table. Her hair was shingled and with a comb she had\r\nrepaired its disorder before he had laced his second shoe. She handed\r\nhim his coat.\r\n\r\n"How shall I get out?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d better wait a bit. I\'ll look out and see that it\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t possibly be Walter. He doesn\'t leave the laboratory till\r\nfive."\r\n\r\n"Who is it then?"\r\n\r\nThey spoke in whispers now. She was quaking. It occurred to him that in\r\nan emergency she would lose her head and on a sudden he felt angry with\r\nher. If it wasn\'t safe why the devil had she said it was? She caught her\r\nbreath and put her hand on his arm. He followed the direction of her\r\nglance. They stood facing the windows that led out on the verandah. They\r\nwere shuttered and the shutters were bolted. They saw the white china\r\nknob of the handle slowly turn. They had heard no one walk along the\r\nverandah. It was terrifying to see that silent motion. A minute passed\r\nand there was no sound. Then, with the ghastliness of the supernatural,\r\nin the same stealthy, noiseless and horrifying manner, they saw the\r\nwhite china knob of the handle at the other window turn also. It was so\r\nfrightening that Kitty, her nerves failing her, opened her mouth to\r\nscream; but, seeing what she was going to do, he swiftly put his hand\r\nover it and her cry was smothered in his fingers.\r\n\r\nSilence. She leaned against him, her knees shaking, and he was afraid\r\nshe would faint. Frowning, his jaw set, he carried her to the bed and\r\nsat her down upon it. She was as white as the sheet and notwithstanding\r\nhis tan his cheeks were pale too. He stood by her side looking with\r\nfascinated gaze at the china knob. They did not speak. Then he saw that\r\nshe was crying.\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake don\'t do that," he whispered irritably. "If we\'re in for\r\nit we\'re in for it. We shall just have to brazen it out."\r\n\r\nShe looked for her handkerchief and knowing what she wanted he gave her\r\nbag.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s your topee?"\r\n\r\n"I left it downstairs."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God!"\r\n\r\n"I say, you must pull yourself together. It\'s a hundred to one it wasn\'t\r\nWalter. Why on earth should he come back at this hour? He never does\r\ncome home in the middle of the day, does he?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet you anything you like it was the amah."\r\n\r\nShe gave him the shadow of a smile. His rich, caressing voice reassured\r\nher and she took his hand and affectionately pressed it. He gave her a\r\nmoment to collect herself.\r\n\r\n"Look here, we can\'t stay here for ever," he said then. "Do you feel up\r\nto going out on the verandah and having a look?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I can stand."\r\n\r\n"Have you got any brandy in here?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. A frown for an instant darkened his brow, he was\r\ngrowing impatient, he did not quite know what to do. Suddenly she\r\nclutched his hand more tightly.\r\n\r\n"Suppose he\'s waiting there?"\r\n\r\nHe forced his lips to smile and his voice retained the gentle,\r\npersuasive tone the effect of which he was so fully conscious of.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not very likely. Have a little pluck, Kitty. How can it possibly\r\nbe your husband? If he\'d come in and seen a strange topee in the hall\r\nand come upstairs and found your room locked, surely he would have made\r\nsome sort of row. It must have been one of the servants. Only a Chinese\r\nwould turn a handle in that way."\r\n\r\nShe did feel more herself now.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not very pleasant even if it was only the amah."\r\n\r\n"She can be squared and if necessary I\'ll put the fear of God into her.\r\nThere are not many advantages in being a government official, but you\r\nmay as well get what you can out of it."\r\n\r\nHe must be right. She stood up and turning to him stretched out her\r\narms: he took her in his and kissed her on the lips. It was such rapture\r\nthat it was pain. She adored him. He released her and she went to the\r\nwindow. She slid back the bolt and opening the shutter a little looked\r\nout. There was not a soul. She slipped on to the verandah, looked into\r\nher husband\'s dressing-room and then into her own sitting-room. Both\r\nwere empty. She went back to the bedroom and beckoned to him.\r\n\r\n"Nobody."\r\n\r\n"I believe the whole thing was an optical delusion."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh. I was terrified. Go into my sitting-room and sit down.\r\nI\'ll put on my stockings and some shoes."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ii_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did as she bade and in five minutes she joined him. He was smoking a\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\n"I say, could I have a brandy and soda?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll ring."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it would hurt _you_ by the look of things."\r\n\r\nThey waited in silence for the boy to answer. She gave the order.\r\n\r\n"Ring up the laboratory and ask if Walter is there," she said then.\r\n"They won\'t know your voice."\r\n\r\nHe took up the receiver and asked for the number. He inquired whether\r\nDr. Fane was in. He put down the receiver.\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t been in since tiffin," he told her. "Ask the boy whether he\r\nhas been here."\r\n\r\n"I daren\'t. It\'ll look so funny if he has and I didn\'t see him."\r\n\r\nThe boy brought the drinks and Townsend helped himself. When he offered\r\nher some she shook her head.\r\n\r\n"What\'s to be done if it was Walter?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he wouldn\'t care."\r\n\r\n"Walter?"\r\n\r\nHer tone was incredulous.\r\n\r\n"It\'s always struck me he was rather shy. Some men can\'t bear scenes,\r\nyou know. He\'s got sense enough to know that there\'s nothing to be\r\ngained by making a scandal. I don\'t believe for a minute it was Walter,\r\nbut even if it was my impression is that he\'ll do nothing. I think he\'ll\r\nignore it."\r\n\r\nShe reflected for a moment.\r\n\r\n"He\'s awfully in love with me."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s all to the good. You\'ll get round him."\r\n\r\nHe gave her that charming smile of his which she had always found so\r\nirresistible. It was a slow smile which started in his clear blue eyes\r\nand travelled by perceptible degrees to his shapely mouth. He had small\r\nwhite even teeth. It was a very sensual smile and it made her heart melt\r\nin her body.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t very much care," she said, with a flash of gaiety. "It was\r\nworth it."\r\n\r\n"It was my fault."\r\n\r\n"Why did you come? I was amazed to see you."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t resist it."\r\n\r\n"You dear."\r\n\r\nShe leaned a little towards him, her dark and shining eyes gazing\r\npassionately into his, her mouth a little open with desire, and he put\r\nhis arms round her. She abandoned herself with a sigh of ecstasy to\r\ntheir shelter.\r\n\r\n"You know you can always count on me," he said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so happy with you. I wish I could make you as happy as you make\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not frightened any more?"\r\n\r\n"I hate Walter," she answered.\r\n\r\nHe did not quite know what to say to this, so he kissed her. Her face\r\nwas very soft against his.\r\n\r\nBut he took her wrist on which was a little gold watch and looked at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I must do now?"\r\n\r\n"Bolt?" she smiled.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. For one instant she clung to him more closely, but she felt\r\nhis desire to go, and she released him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s shameful the way you neglect your work. Be off with you."\r\n\r\nHe could never resist the temptation to flirt.\r\n\r\n"You seem in a devil of a hurry to get rid of me," he said lightly.\r\n\r\n"You know that I hate to let you go."\r\n\r\nHer answer was low and deep and serious. He gave a flattered laugh.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry your pretty little head about our mysterious visitor. I\'m\r\nquite sure it was the amah. And if there\'s any trouble I guarantee to\r\nget you out of it."\r\n\r\n"Have you had a lot of experience?"\r\n\r\nHis smile was amused and complacent.\r\n\r\n"No, but I flatter myself that I\'ve got a head screwed on my shoulders."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_iii_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe went out on to the veranda and watched him leave the house. He waved\r\nhis hand to her. It gave her a little thrill as she looked at him; he\r\nwas forty-one, but he had the lithe figure and the springing step of a\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nThe veranda was in shadow; and lazily, her heart at ease with satisfied\r\nlove, she lingered. Their house stood in the Pleasant Vale, on the side\r\nof the hill, for they could not afford to live on the more eligible but\r\nexpensive Mount. But her abstracted gaze scarcely noticed the blue sea\r\nand the crowded shipping in the harbour. She could think only of her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nOf course it was stupid to behave as they had done that afternoon, but\r\nif he wanted her how could she be prudent? He had come two or three\r\ntimes after tiffin, when in the heat of the day no one thought of\r\nstirring out, and not even the boys had seen him come and go. It was\r\nvery difficult at Tching-Yen. She hated the Chinese city and it made her\r\nnervous to go into the filthy little house off the Victoria Road in\r\nwhich they were in the habit of meeting. It was a curio dealer\'s; and\r\nthe Chinese who were sitting about stared at her unpleasantly; she hated\r\nthe ingratiating smile of the old man who took her to the back of the\r\nshop and then up a dark flight of stairs. The room into which he led her\r\nwas frowsy and the large wooden bed against the wall made her shudder.\r\n\r\n"This is dreadfully sordid, isn\'t it?" she said to Charlie the first\r\ntime she met him there.\r\n\r\n"It was till you came in," he answered.\r\n\r\nOf course the moment he took her in his arms she forgot everything.\r\n\r\nOh, how hateful it was that she wasn\'t free, that they both weren\'t\r\nfree! She didn\'t like his wife. Kitty\'s wandering thoughts dwelt now for\r\na moment on Dorothy Townsend. How unfortunate to be called Dorothy! It\r\ndated you. She was thirty-eight at least. But Charlie never spoke of\r\nher. Of course he didn\'t care for her; she bored him to death. But he\r\nwas a gentleman. Kitty smiled with affectionate irony: it was just like\r\nhim, silly old thing; he might be unfaithful to her, but he would never\r\nallow a word in disparagement of her to cross his lips. She was a\r\ntallish woman, taller than Kitty, neither stout nor thin, with a good\r\ndeal of pale brown hair; she could never have been pretty with anything\r\nbut the prettiness of youth; her features were good enough without being\r\nremarkable and her blue eyes were cold. She had a skin that you would\r\nnever look at twice and no colour in her cheeks. And she dressed\r\nlike--well, like what she was, the wife of the Assistant Colonial\r\nSecretary at Tching-Yen. Kitty smiled and gave her shoulders a faint\r\nshrug.\r\n\r\nOf course no one could deny that Dorothy Townsend had a pleasant voice.\r\nShe was a wonderful mother, Charlie always said that of her, and she was\r\nwhat Kitty\'s mother called a gentlewoman. But Kitty did not like her.\r\nShe did not like her casual manner; and the politeness with which she\r\ntreated you when you went there, to tea or dinner, was exasperating\r\nbecause you could not but feel how little interest she took in you. The\r\nfact was, Kitty supposed, that she cared for nothing but her children:\r\nthere were two boys at school in England, and another boy of six whom\r\nshe was going to take home next year. Her face was a mask. She smiled\r\nand in her pleasant, well-mannered way said the things that were\r\nexpected of her; but for all her cordiality held you at a distance. She\r\nhad a few intimate friends in the Colony and they greatly admired her.\r\nKitty wondered whether Mrs. Townsend thought her a little common. She\r\nflushed. After all there was no reason for her to put on airs. It was\r\ntrue that her father had been a Colonial Governor and of course it was\r\nvery grand while it lasted--every one stood up when you entered a room\r\nand men took off their hats to you as you passed in your car--but what\r\ncould be more insignificant than a Colonial Governor when he had\r\nretired? Dorothy Townsend\'s father lived on a pension in a small house\r\nat Earl\'s Court. Kitty\'s mother would think it a dreadful bore if she\r\nasked her to call. Kitty\'s father, Bernard Garstin, was a K.C., and\r\nthere was no reason why he should not be made a judge one of these days.\r\nAnyhow they lived in South Kensington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_iv_\r\n\r\n\r\nKitty, coming to Tching-Yen on her marriage, had found it hard to\r\nreconcile herself to the fact that her social position was determined by\r\nher husband\'s occupation. Of course every one had been very kind and for\r\ntwo or three months they had gone out to parties almost every night;\r\nwhen they dined at Government House the Governor took her in as a bride;\r\nbut she had understood quickly that as the wife of the Government\r\nbacteriologist she was of no particular consequence. It made her angry.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too absurd," she told her husband. "Why, there\'s hardly any one\r\nhere that one would bother about for five minutes at home. Mother\r\nwouldn\'t dream of asking any of them to dine at our house."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t let it worry you," he answered. "It doesn\'t really matter,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Of course it doesn\'t matter, it only shows how stupid they are, but it\r\nis rather funny when you think of all the people who used to come to our\r\nhouse at home that here we should be treated like dirt."\r\n\r\n"From a social standpoint the man of science does not exist," he smiled.\r\n\r\nShe knew that now, but she had not known it when she married him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it exactly amuses me to be taken in to dinner by the\r\nagent of the P. and O.," she said, laughing in order that what she said\r\nmight not seem snobbish.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he saw the reproach behind her lightness of manner, for he took\r\nher hand and shyly pressed it.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully sorry, Kitty dear, but don\'t let it vex you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not going to let it do that."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_v_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt couldn\'t have been Walter that afternoon. It must have been one of\r\nthe servants and after all they didn\'t matter. Chinese servants knew\r\neverything anyway. But they held their tongues.\r\n\r\nHer heart beat a little faster as she remembered the way in which that\r\nwhite china knob slowly turned. They mustn\'t take risks like that again.\r\nIt was better to go to the curio shop. No one who saw her go in would\r\nthink anything of it, and they were absolutely safe there. The owner of\r\nthe shop knew who Charlie was and he was not such a fool as to put up\r\nthe back of the Assistant Colonial Secretary. What did anything matter\r\nreally but that Charlie loved her?\r\n\r\nShe turned away from the verandah and went back into her sitting-room.\r\nShe threw herself down on the sofa and stretched out her hand to get a\r\ncigarette. Her eye caught sight of a note lying on the top of a book.\r\nShe opened it. It was written in pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dear Kitty_,\r\n\r\n_Here is the book you wanted. I was just going to send it when I met Dr.\r\nFane and he said he\'d bring it round himself as he was passing the\r\nhouse._\r\n\r\n\r\n_V.H._\r\n\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell and when the boy came asked him who had brought the\r\nbook and when.\r\n\r\n"Master bring it, missy, after tiffin," he answered.\r\n\r\nThen it had been Walter. She rang up the Colonial Secretary\'s Office at\r\nonce and asked for Charlie. She told him what she had just learned.\r\nThere was a pause before he answered.\r\n\r\n"What shall I do?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m in the middle of an important consultation. I\'m afraid I can\'t talk\r\nto you now. My advice to you is to sit tight."\r\n\r\nShe put down the receiver. She understood that he was not alone and she\r\nwas impatient with his business.\r\n\r\nShe sat down again, at a desk, and resting her face in her hands sought\r\nto think out the situation. Of course Walter might merely have thought\r\nshe was sleeping: there was no reason why she should not lock herself\r\nin. She tried to remember if they had been talking. Certainly they had\r\nnot been talking loud. And there was the hat. It was maddening of\r\nCharlie to have left it downstairs. But it was no use blaming him for\r\nthat, it was natural enough, and there was nothing to tell that Walter\r\nhad noticed it. He was probably in a hurry and had just left the book\r\nand the note on his way to some appointment connected with his work. The\r\nstrange thing was that he should have tried the door and then the two\r\nwindows. If he thought she was asleep it was unlike him to disturb her.\r\nWhat a fool she had been!\r\n\r\nShe shook herself a little and again she felt that sweet pain in her\r\nheart which she always felt when she thought of Charlie. It had been\r\nworth it. He had said that he would stand by her, and if the worse came\r\nto the worst, well. . . . Let Walter kick up a row if he chose. She had\r\nCharlie; what did she care? Perhaps it would be the best thing for him\r\nto know. She had never cared for Walter and since she had loved Charlie\r\nTownsend it had irked and bored her to submit to her husband\'s caresses.\r\nShe wanted to have nothing more to do with him. She didn\'t see how he\r\ncould prove anything. If he accused her she would deny, and if it came\r\nto pass that she could deny no longer, well, she would fling the truth\r\nin his teeth, and he could do what he chose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_vi_\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin three months of her marriage she knew that she had made a\r\nmistake; but it had been her mother\'s fault even more than hers.\r\n\r\nThere was a photograph of her mother in the room and Kitty\'s harassed\r\neyes fell on it. She did not know why she kept it there, for she was not\r\nvery fond of her mother; there was one of her father too, but that was\r\ndownstairs on the grand piano. It had been done when he took silk and it\r\nrepresented him in wig and gown. Even they could not make him imposing;\r\nhe was a little, wizened man, with tired eyes, a long upper lip, and a\r\nthin mouth: a facetious photographer had told him to look pleasant, but\r\nhe had succeeded only in looking severe. It was on this account, for as\r\na rule the downturned corners of his mouth and the dejection of his eyes\r\ngave him an air of mild depression, that Mrs. Garstin, thinking it made\r\nhim look judicial, had chosen it from among the proofs. But her own\r\nphotograph showed her in the dress in which she had gone to Court when\r\nher husband was made a King\'s Counsel. She was very grand in the velvet\r\ngown, the long train so disposed as to show to advantage, with feathers\r\nin her hair and flowers in her hand. She held herself erect. She was a\r\nwoman of fifty, thin and flat-chested, with prominent cheek-bones and a\r\nlarge, well-shaped nose. She had a great quantity of very smooth black\r\nhair and Kitty had always suspected that, if not dyed, it was at least\r\ntouched up. Her fine black eyes were never still and this was the most\r\nnoticeable thing about her; for when she was talking to you it was\r\ndisconcerting to see those restless eyes in that impassive, unlined and\r\nyellow face. They moved from one part of you to another, to other\r\npersons in the room, and then back to you; you felt that she was\r\ncriticising you, summing you up, watchful meanwhile of all that went on\r\naround her, and that the words she spoke had no connection with her\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_vii_\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Garstin was a hard, cruel, managing, ambitious, parsimonious and\r\nstupid woman. She was the daughter, one of five, of a solicitor in\r\nLiverpool and Bernard Garstin had met her when he was on the Northern\r\nCircuit. He had seemed then a young man of promise and her father said\r\nhe would go far. He hadn\'t. He was painstaking, industrious and capable,\r\nbut he had not the will to advance himself. Mrs. Garstin despised him.\r\nBut she recognised, though with bitterness, that she could only achieve\r\nsuccess through him, and she set herself to drive him on the way she\r\ndesired to go. She nagged him without mercy. She discovered that if she\r\nwanted him to do something which his sensitiveness revolted against she\r\nhad only to give him no peace and eventually, exhausted, he would yield.\r\nOn her side she set herself to cultivate the people who might be useful.\r\nShe flattered the solicitors who would send her husband briefs and was\r\nfamiliar with their wives. She was obsequious to the judges and their\r\nladies. She made much of promising politicians.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-five years Mrs. Garstin never invited any one to dine at her\r\nhouse because she liked him. She gave large dinner parties at regular\r\nintervals. But parsimony was as strong in her as ambition. She hated to\r\nspend money. She flattered herself that she could make as much show as\r\nany one else at half the price. Her dinners were long and elaborate, but\r\nthrifty, and she could never persuade herself that people when they were\r\neating and talking knew what they drank. She wrapped sparkling Moselle\r\nin a napkin and thought her guests took it for champagne.\r\n\r\nBernard Garstin had a fair, though not a large practice. Men who had\r\nbeen called after him had long outstripped him. Mrs. Garstin made him\r\nstand for Parliament. The expense of the election was borne by the\r\nparty, but here again her parsimony balked her ambition, and she could\r\nnot bring herself to spend enough money to nurse the constituency. The\r\nsubscriptions Bernard Garstin made to the innumerable funds a candidate\r\nis expected to contribute to, were always just a little less than\r\nadequate. He was beaten. Though it would have pleased Mrs. Garstin to be\r\na member\'s wife she bore her disappointment with fortitude. The fact of\r\nher husband\'s standing had brought her in contact with a number of\r\nprominent persons and she appreciated the addition to her social\r\nconsequence. She knew that Bernard would never make his mark in the\r\nHouse. She wanted him to be a member only that he might have a claim on\r\nthe gratitude of his party and surely to fight two or three losing seats\r\nwould give him that.\r\n\r\nBut he was still a junior and many younger men than he had already taken\r\nsilk. It was necessary that he should too, not only because otherwise he\r\ncould scarcely hope to be made a judge, but on her account also: it\r\nmortified her to go in to dinner after women ten years younger than\r\nherself. But here she encountered in her husband an obstinacy which she\r\nhad not for years been accustomed to. He was afraid that as a K.C. he\r\nwould get no work. A bird in the hand was worth two in the bush, he told\r\nher, to which she retorted that a proverb was the last refuge of the\r\nmentally destitute. He suggested to her the possibility that his income\r\nwould be halved and he knew that there was no argument which could have\r\ngreater weight with her. She would not listen. She called him\r\npusillanimous. She gave him no peace and at last, as always, he yielded.\r\nHe applied for silk and it was promptly awarded him.\r\n\r\nHis misgivings were justified. He made no headway as a leader and his\r\nbriefs were few. But he concealed any disappointment he may have felt,\r\nand if he reproached his wife it was in his heart. He grew perhaps a\r\nlittle more silent, but he had always been silent at home, and no one in\r\nhis family noticed a change in him. His daughters had never looked upon\r\nhim as anything but a source of income; it had always seemed perfectly\r\nnatural that he should lead a dog\'s life in order to provide them with\r\nboard and lodging, clothes, holiday and money for odds and ends; and\r\nnow, understanding that through his fault money was less plentiful, the\r\nindifference they had felt for him was tinged with an exasperated\r\ncontempt. It never occurred to them to ask themselves what were the\r\nfeelings of the subdued little man who went out early in the morning and\r\ncame home at night only in time to dress for dinner. He was a stranger\r\nto them, but because he was their father they took it for granted that\r\nhe should love and cherish them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_viii_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there was a quality of courage in Mrs. Garstin which in itself was\r\nadmirable. She let no one in her immediate circle, which to her was the\r\nworld, see how mortified she was by the frustration of her hopes. She\r\nmade no change in her style of living. By careful management she was\r\nable to give as showy dinners as she had done before, and she met her\r\nfriends with the same bright gaiety which she had so long cultivated.\r\nShe had a hard and facile fund of chit-chat which in the society she\r\nmoved in passed for conversation. She was a useful guest among persons\r\nto whom small talk did not come easily, for she was never at a loss with\r\na new topic and could be trusted immediately to break an awkward silence\r\nwith a suitable observation.\r\n\r\nIt was unlikely now that Bernard Garstin would ever be made a judge of\r\nthe High Court, but he might still hope for a County Court judgeship or\r\nat the worst an appointment in the Colonies. Meanwhile she had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing him appointed Recorder of a Welsh town. But it\r\nwas on her daughters that she set her hopes. By arranging good marriages\r\nfor them she expected to make up for all the disappointments of her\r\ncareer. There were two, Kitty and Doris. Doris gave no sign of good\r\nlooks, her nose was too long and her figure was lumpy; so that Mrs.\r\nGarstin could hope no more for her than that she should marry a young\r\nman who was well off and in a suitable profession.\r\n\r\nBut Kitty was a beauty. She gave promise of being so when she was still\r\na child, for she had large, dark eyes, liquid and vivacious, brown,\r\ncurling hair in which there was a reddish tint, exquisite teeth and a\r\nlovely skin. Her features would never be very good, for her chin was too\r\nsquare and her nose, though not so long as Doris\'s, too big. Her beauty\r\ndepended a good deal on her youth, and Mrs. Garstin realised that she\r\nmust marry in the first flush of her maidenhood. When she came out she\r\nwas dazzling: her skin was still her greatest beauty, but her eyes with\r\ntheir long lashes were so starry and yet so melting that it gave you a\r\ncatch at the heart to look into them. She had a charming gaiety and the\r\ndesire to please. Mrs. Garstin bestowed upon her all the affection, a\r\nharsh, competent, calculating affection, of which she was capable; she\r\ndreamed ambitious dreams; it was not a good marriage she aimed at for\r\nher daughter, but a brilliant one.\r\n\r\nKitty had been brought up with the knowledge that she was going to be a\r\nbeautiful woman and she more than suspected her mother\'s ambition. It\r\naccorded with her own desires. She was launched upon the world and Mrs.\r\nGarstin performed prodigies in getting herself invited to dances where\r\nher daughter might meet eligible men. Kitty was a success. She was\r\namusing as well as beautiful, and very soon she had a dozen men in love\r\nwith her. But none was suitable, and Kitty, charming and friendly with\r\nall, took care to commit herself with none. The drawing-room in South\r\nKensington was filled on Sunday afternoons with amorous youth, but Mrs.\r\nGarstin observed, with a grim smile of approval, that it needed no\r\neffort on her part to keep them at a distance from Kitty. Kitty was\r\nprepared to flirt with them, and it diverted her to play one off against\r\nthe other, but when they proposed to her, as none failed to do, she\r\nrefused them with tact but decision.\r\n\r\nHer first season passed without the perfect suitor presenting himself,\r\nand the second also; but she was young and could afford to wait. Mrs.\r\nGarstin told her friends that she thought it a pity for a girl to marry\r\ntill she was twenty-one. But a third year passed and then a fourth. Two\r\nor three of her old admirers proposed again, but they were still\r\npenniless, one or two boys younger than herself proposed; a retired\r\nIndian Civilian, a K.C.I.E., did the same: he was fifty-three. Kitty\r\nstill danced a great deal, she went to Wimbledon and Lord\'s, to Ascot\r\nand Henley; she was thoroughly enjoying herself; but still no one whose\r\nposition and income were satisfactory asked her to marry him. Mrs.\r\nGarstin began to grow uneasy. She noticed that Kitty was beginning to\r\nattract men of forty and over. She reminded her that she would not be\r\nany longer so pretty in a year or two and that young girls were coming\r\nout all the time. Mrs. Garstin did not mince her words in the domestic\r\ncircle and she warned her daughter tartly that she would miss her\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nKitty shrugged her shoulders. She thought herself as pretty as ever,\r\nprettier perhaps, for she had learnt how to dress in the last four\r\nyears, and she had plenty of time. If she wanted to marry just to be\r\nmarried there were a dozen boys who would jump at the chance. Surely the\r\nright man would come along sooner or later. But Mrs. Garstin judged the\r\nsituation more shrewdly: with anger in her heart for the beautiful\r\ndaughter who had missed her chances she set her standard a little lower.\r\nShe turned back to the professional class at which she had sneered in\r\nher pride and looked about for a young lawyer or a business man whose\r\nfuture inspired her with confidence.\r\n\r\nKitty reached the age of twenty-five and was still unmarried. Mrs.\r\nGarstin was exasperated and she did not hesitate often to give Kitty a\r\npiece of her very unpleasant mind. She asked her how much longer she\r\nexpected her father to support her. He had spent sums he could ill\r\nafford in order to give her a chance and she had not taken it. It never\r\nstruck Mrs. Garstin that perhaps her own hard affability had frightened\r\nthe men, sons of wealthy fathers or heirs to a title, whose visits she\r\nhad too cordially encouraged. She put down Kitty\'s failure to stupidity.\r\nThen Doris came out. She had a long nose still, and a poor figure, and\r\nshe danced badly. In her first season she became engaged to Geoffrey\r\nDennison. He was the only son of a prosperous surgeon who had been given\r\na baronetcy during the war. Geoffrey would inherit a title--it is not\r\nvery grand to be a medical baronet, but a title, thank God, is still a\r\ntitle--and a very comfortable fortune.\r\n\r\nKitty in a panic married Walter Fane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ix_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had known him but a little while and had never taken much notice of\r\nhim. She had no idea when or where they had first met till after their\r\nengagement he told her that it was at a dance to which some friends had\r\nbrought him. She certainly paid no attention to him then and if she\r\ndanced with him it was because she was good-natured and was glad to\r\ndance with any one who asked her. She didn\'t know him from Adam when a\r\nday or two later at another dance he came up and spoke to her. Then she\r\nremarked that he was at every dance she went to.\r\n\r\n"You know, I\'ve danced with you at least a dozen times now and you must\r\ntell me your name," she said to him at last in her laughing way.\r\n\r\nHe was obviously taken aback.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say you don\'t know it? I was introduced to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but people always mumble. I shouldn\'t be at all surprised if you\r\nhadn\'t the ghost of an idea what mine was."\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her. His face was grace and a trifle stern, but his smile\r\nwas very sweet.\r\n\r\n"Of course I know it." He was silent for a moment or two. "Have you no\r\ncuriosity?" he asked then.\r\n\r\n"As much as most women."\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t occur to you to ask somebody or other what my name was?"\r\n\r\nShe was faintly amused; she wondered why he thought it could in the\r\nleast interest her; but she liked to please, so she looked at him with\r\nthat dazzling smile of hers, and her beautiful eyes, dewy ponds under\r\nforest trees, held an enchanting kindness.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"Walter Fane."\r\n\r\nShe did not know why he came to dances, he did not dance very well, and\r\nhe seemed to know few people. She had a passing thought that he was in\r\nlove with her; but she dismissed it with a shrug of the shoulders: she\r\nhad known girls who thought every man they met was in love with them and\r\nhad always found them absurd. But she gave Walter Fane just a little\r\nmore of her attention. He certainly did not behave like any of the other\r\nyouths who had been in love with her. Most of them told her so frankly\r\nand wanted to kiss her: a good many did. But Walter Fane never talked of\r\nher and very little of himself. He was rather silent; she did not mind\r\nthat because she had plenty to say and it pleased her to see him laugh\r\nwhen she made a facetious remark: but when he talked it was not\r\nstupidly. He was evidently shy. It appeared that he lived in the East\r\nand was home on leave.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon he appeared at their house in South Kensington.\r\nThere were a dozen people there, and he sat for some time, somewhat ill\r\nat ease, and then went away. Her mother asked her later who he was.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t a notion. Did you ask him to come here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I met him at the Baddeleys. He said he\'d seen you at various\r\ndances. I said I was always at home on Sundays."\r\n\r\n"His name is Fane and he\'s got some sort of job in the East."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'s a doctor. Is he in love with you?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought you knew by now when a young man was in love with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t marry him if he were," said Kitty lightly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garstin did not answer. Her silence was heavy with displeasure.\r\nKitty flushed: she knew that her mother did not care now whom she\r\nmarried so long as somehow she got her off her hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_x_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next week she met him at three dances and now, his shyness\r\nperhaps wearing off a little, he was somewhat more communicative. He was\r\na doctor, certainly, but he did not practice; he was a bacteriologist\r\n(Kitty had only a very vague idea what that meant) and he had a job at\r\nTching-Yen. He was going back in the autumn. He talked a good deal about\r\nChina. She made it a practice to appear interested in whatever people\r\ntalked to her of, but indeed the life in Tching-Yen sounded quite jolly;\r\nthere were clubs and tennis and racing and polo and golf.\r\n\r\n"Do people dance much there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I think so."\r\n\r\nShe wondered whether he told her these things with a motive. He seemed\r\nto like her society, but never by a pressure of the hand, by a glance or\r\nby a word, did he give the smallest indication that he looked upon her\r\nas anything but a girl whom you met and danced with. On the following\r\nSunday he came again to their house. Her father happened to come in, it\r\nwas raining and he had not been able to play golf, and he and Walter\r\nFane had a long chat. She asked her father afterwards what they had\r\ntalked of.\r\n\r\n"It appears he\'s stationed in Tching-Yen. The Chief Justice is an old\r\nfriend of mine at the Bar. He seems an unusually intelligent young man."\r\n\r\nShe knew that her father was as a rule bored to death by the young\r\npeople whom for her sake and now her sister\'s he had been forced for\r\nyears to entertain.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not often you like any of my young men, father," she said.\r\n\r\nHis kind, tired eyes rested upon her.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to marry him by any chance?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"Is he in love with you?"\r\n\r\n"He shows no sign of it."\r\n\r\n"Do you like him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I do very much. He irritates me a little."\r\n\r\nHe was not her type at all. He was short, but not thick-set, slight\r\nrather and thin; dark and clean-shaven, with very regular, clear-cut\r\nfeatures. His eyes were almost black, but not large, they were not very\r\nmobile and they rested on objects with a singular persistence; they were\r\ncurious, but not very pleasant eyes. With his straight, delicate nose,\r\nhis fine brow and well-shaped mouth he ought to have been good-looking.\r\nBut surprisingly enough he was not. When Kitty began to think of him at\r\nall she was surprised that he should have such good features when you\r\ntook them one by one and yet be so far from handsome. His face was cold.\r\nHis expression was slightly sarcastic and now that Kitty knew him better\r\nshe realised that she was not quite at ease with him. He had no gaiety.\r\n\r\nBy the time the season drew to its end they had seen a good deal of one\r\nanother, but he had remained as aloof and impenetrable as ever. He was\r\nnot exactly shy with her, but embarrassed; his conversation remained\r\nstrangely impersonal. Kitty came to the conclusion that he was not in\r\nthe least in love with her. He liked her and found her easy to talk to,\r\nbut when he returned to Tching-Yen in November he would not think of her\r\nagain. She thought it not impossible that he was engaged all the time to\r\nsome nurse in a hospital at Tching-Yen, the daughter of a clergyman,\r\ndull, plain, flat-footed and strenuous; that was the wife that would\r\nexactly suit him.\r\n\r\nThen came the announcement of Doris\'s engagement to Geoffrey Dennison.\r\nDoris, at eighteen, was making quite a good marriage, and she was\r\ntwenty-five and single. Supposing she did not marry at all? That season the\r\nonly person who had proposed to her was a boy of twenty who was still at\r\nOxford: she couldn\'t marry a boy five years younger than herself. She\r\nhad made a hash of things. Last year she had refused a widowed Knight of\r\nthe Bath with three children. She almost wished she hadn\'t. Mother would\r\nbe horrible now, and Doris, Doris who had always been sacrificed because\r\nshe, Kitty, was expected to make the brilliant match, would not fail to\r\ncrow over her. Kitty\'s heart sank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xi_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut one afternoon when she was walking home from Harrod\'s she chanced to\r\nmeet Walter Fane in the Brompton Road. He stopped and talked to her.\r\nThen, casually, he asked her if she would not take a turn with him in\r\nthe Park. She had no particular wish to go home: it was not just then a\r\nvery agreeable place. They strolled along, talking as they always\r\ntalked, of casual things, and he asked her where she was going for the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we always bury ourselves in the country. You see, father is\r\nexhausted after the term\'s work and we just go to the quietest place we\r\ncan find."\r\n\r\nKitty spoke with her tongue in her cheek, for she knew quite well that\r\nher father had not nearly enough work to tire him and even if he had his\r\nconvenience would never have been consulted in the choice of a holiday.\r\nBut a quiet place was a cheap place.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think those chairs look rather inviting?" said Walter\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\nShe followed his eyes and saw two green chairs by themselves under a\r\ntree on the grass.\r\n\r\n"Let us sit in them," she said.\r\n\r\nBut when they were seated he seemed to grow strangely abstracted. He was\r\nan odd creature. She chattered on, however, gaily enough and wondered\r\nwhy he had asked her to walk with him in the Park. Perhaps he was going\r\nto confide in her his passion for the flat-footed nurse in Tching-Yen.\r\nSuddenly he turned to her, interrupting her in the middle of a sentence,\r\nso that she could not but see that he had not been listening, and his\r\nface was chalk white.\r\n\r\n"I want to say something to you."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly and she saw that his eyes were filled with a\r\npainful anxiety. His voice was strained, low and not quite steady. But\r\nbefore she could ask herself what this agitation meant he spoke again.\r\n\r\n"I want to ask you if you\'ll marry me."\r\n\r\n"You could knock me down with a feather," she answered so surprised that\r\nshe looked at him blankly.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you know I was awfully in love with you?"\r\n\r\n"You never showed it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very awkward and clumsy. I always find it more difficult to say the\r\nthings I mean than the things I don\'t."\r\n\r\nHer heart began to beat a little more quickly. She had been proposed to\r\noften before, but gaily or sentimentally, and she had answered in the\r\nsame fashion. No one had ever asked her to marry him in a manner which\r\nwas so abrupt and yet strangely tragic.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind of you," she said, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. I wanted to ask you\r\nbefore, but I could never bring myself to it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure if that\'s very well put," she chuckled.\r\n\r\nShe was glad to have an opportunity to laugh a little, for on that fine,\r\nsunny day the air about them seemed on a sudden heavy with foreboding.\r\nHe frowned darkly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know what I mean. I didn\'t want to lose hope. But now you\'re\r\ngoing away and in the autumn I have to go back to China."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never thought of you in that way," she said helplessly.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing more. He looked down on the grass sullenly. He was a\r\nvery odd creature. But now that he had told her she felt in some\r\nmysterious way that his love was something she had never met before. She\r\nwas a little frightened, but she was elated also. His impassivity was\r\nvaguely impressive.\r\n\r\n"You must give me time to think."\r\n\r\nStill he did not say anything. He did not stir. Did he mean to keep her\r\nthere till she had decided? That was absurd. She must talk it over with\r\nher mother. She ought to have got up when she spoke, she had waited\r\nthinking he would answer, and now, she did not know why, she found it\r\ndifficult to make a movement. She did not look at him, but she was\r\nconscious of his appearance; she had never seen herself marrying a man\r\nso little taller than herself. When you sat close to him you saw how\r\ngood his features were, and how cold his face. It was strange when you\r\ncouldn\'t help being conscious of the devastating passion which was in\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know you, I don\'t know you at all," she said tremulously.\r\n\r\nHe gave her a look and she felt her eyes drawn to his.\r\n\r\nThey had a tenderness which she had never seen in them before, but there\r\nwas something beseeching in them, like a dog\'s that has been whipped,\r\nwhich slightly exasperated her.\r\n\r\n"I think I improve on acquaintance," he said.\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'re shy, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\nIt was certainly the oddest proposal she had ever had. And even now it\r\nseemed to her that they were saying to one another the last things you\r\nwould have expected on such an occasion. She was not in the least in\r\nlove with him. She did not know why she hesitated to refuse him at once.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully stupid," he said, "I want to tell you that I love you more\r\nthan anything in the world, but I find it so awfully difficult to say."\r\n\r\nNow that was odd too, for inexplicably enough it touched her; he wasn\'t\r\nreally cold, of course, it was his manner that was unfortunate: she\r\nliked him at that moment better than she had ever liked him before.\r\nDoris was to be married in November. He would be on his way to China\r\nthen and if she married him she would be with him. It wouldn\'t be very\r\nnice to be a bridesmaid at Doris\'s wedding. She would be glad to escape\r\nthat. And then Doris as a married woman and herself still single! Every\r\none knew how young Doris was and it would make her seem older. It would\r\nput her on the shelf. It wouldn\'t be a very good marriage for her, but\r\nit was a marriage, and the fact that she would live in China made it\r\neasier. She was afraid of her mother\'s bitter tongue. Why, all the girls\r\nwho had come out with her were married long ago and most of them had\r\nchildren; she was tired of going to see them and gushing over their\r\nbabies. Walter Fane offered her a new life. She turned to him with a\r\nsmile which she well knew the effect of.\r\n\r\n"If I were so rash as to say I\'d marry you when would you want to marry\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nHe gave a sudden gasp of delight, and his white cheeks flushed.\r\n\r\n"Now. At once. As soon as possible. We\'d go to Italy for our honeymoon.\r\nAugust and September."\r\n\r\nThat would save her from spending the summer in a country vicarage,\r\nhired at five guineas a week, with her father and mother. In a flash she\r\nsaw in her mind\'s eye the announcement in the _Morning Post_ that, the\r\nbridegroom having to return to the East, the wedding would take place at\r\nonce. She knew her mother well enough, she could be counted on to make a\r\nsplash; for the moment at least Doris would be in the background and\r\nwhen Doris\'s much grander wedding took place she would be far away.\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand.\r\n\r\n"I think I like you very much. You must give me time to get used to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s yes?" he interrupted.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xii_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe knew him very little then, and now, though they had been married for\r\nnearly two years, she knew him but little more. At first she had been\r\ntouched by his kindness and flattered, though surprised, by his passion.\r\nHe was extremely considerate; he was very attentive to her comfort; she\r\nnever expressed the slightest wish without his hastening to gratify it.\r\nHe was constantly giving her little presents. When she happened to feel\r\nill no one could have been kinder or more thoughtful. She seemed to do\r\nhim a favour when she gave him the opportunity of doing something\r\ntiresome for her. And he was always exceedingly polite. He rose to his\r\nfeet when she entered a room, he gave her his hand to help her out of a\r\ncar, if he chanced to meet her in the street he took off his hat, he was\r\nsolicitous to open the door for her when she left a room, he never came\r\ninto her bedroom or her boudoir without a knock. He treated her not as\r\nKitty had seen most men treat their wives, but as though she were a\r\nfellow-guest in a country house. It was pleasing and yet a trifle comic.\r\nShe would have felt more at home with him if he had been more casual.\r\nNor did their conjugal relations draw her closer to him. He was\r\npassionate then, fierce, oddly hysterical too, and sentimental.\r\n\r\nIt disconcerted her to realise how emotional he really was. His\r\nself-control was due to shyness or to long training, she did not know\r\nwhich; it seemed to her faintly contemptible that when she lay in his\r\narms, his desire appeased, he who was so timid of saying absurd things,\r\nwho so feared to be ridiculous, should use baby talk. She had offended\r\nhim bitterly once by laughing and telling him that he was talking the\r\nmost fearful slush. She had felt his arms grow limp about her, he\r\nremained quite silent for a little while, and then without a word\r\nreleased her and went into his own room. She didn\'t want to hurt his\r\nfeelings and a day or two later she said to him:\r\n\r\n"You silly old thing, I don\'t mind what nonsense you talk to me."\r\n\r\nHe had laughed in a shamefaced way. She had discovered very soon that he\r\nhad an unhappy disability to lose himself. He was self-conscious. When\r\nthere was a party and every one started singing Walter could never bring\r\nhimself to join in. He sat there smiling to show that he was pleased and\r\namused, but his smile was forced; it was more like a sarcastic smirk,\r\nand you could not help feeling that he thought all those people enjoying\r\nthemselves a pack of fools. He could not bring himself to play the round\r\ngames which Kitty with her high spirits found such a lark. On their\r\njourney out to China he had absolutely refused to put on fancy dress\r\nwhen every one else was wearing it. It disturbed her pleasure that he\r\nshould so obviously think the whole thing a bore.\r\n\r\nKitty was lively; she was willing to chatter all day long and she\r\nlaughed easily. His silence disconcerted her. He had a way which\r\nexasperated her of returning no answer to some casual remark of hers. It\r\nwas true that it needed no answer, but an answer all the same would have\r\nbeen pleasant. If it was raining and she said: "It\'s raining cats and\r\ndogs," she would have liked him to say: "Yes, isn\'t it?" He remained\r\nsilent. Sometimes she would have liked to shake him.\r\n\r\n"I said it was raining cats and dogs," she repeated.\r\n\r\n"I heard you," he answered, with his affectionate smile.\r\n\r\nIt showed that he had not meant to be offensive. He did not speak\r\nbecause he had nothing to say. But if nobody spoke unless he had\r\nsomething to say, Kitty reflected, with a smile, the human race would\r\nvery soon lose the use of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xiii_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact was, of course, that he had no charm. That was why he was not\r\npopular, and she had not been long in Tching-Yen before she discovered\r\nthat he was not. She remained very vague about his work. It was enough\r\nfor her to realise, and she did this quite distinctly, that to be the\r\ngovernment bacteriologist was no great fry. He seemed to have no desire\r\nto discuss that part of his life with her. Because she was willing to be\r\ninterested in anything at first she had asked him about it. He put her\r\noff with a jest.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very dull and technical," he said on another occasion. "And it\'s\r\ngrossly underpaid."\r\n\r\nHe was very reserved. All she knew about his antecedents, his birth, his\r\neducation, and his life before he met her, she had elicited by direct\r\nquestioning. It was odd, the only thing that seemed to annoy him was a\r\nquestion; and when, in her natural curiosity, she fired a string of them\r\nat him, his answers became at every one more abrupt. She had the wit to\r\nsee that he did not care to reply because he had anything to hide from\r\nher, but merely from a natural secretiveness. It bored him to talk about\r\nhimself. It made him shy and uncomfortable. He did not know how to be\r\nopen. He was fond of reading, but he read books which seemed to Kitty\r\nvery dull. If he was not busy with some scientific treatise he would\r\nread books about China or historical works. He never relaxed. She did\r\nnot think he could. He was fond of games: he played tennis and bridge.\r\n\r\nShe wondered why he had ever fallen in love with her. She could not\r\nimagine any one less suited than herself to this restrained, cold and\r\nself-possessed man. And yet it was quite certain that he loved her\r\nmadly. He would do anything in the world to please her. He was like wax\r\nin her hands. When she thought of one side he showed her, a side which\r\nonly she had seen, she a little despised him. She wondered whether his\r\nsarcastic manner, with its contemptuous tolerance for so many persons\r\nand things she admired, was merely a fa\xc3\xa7ade to conceal a profound\r\nweakness. She supposed he was clever, every one seemed to think he was,\r\nbut except very occasionally when he was with two or three people he\r\nliked and was in the mood, she had never found him entertaining. He did\r\nnot precisely bore her, he left her indifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xiv_\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Kitty had met his wife at various tea-parties she had been some\r\nweeks in Tching-Yen before she saw Charles Townsend. She was introduced\r\nto him only when with her husband she went to dine at his house. Kitty\r\nwas on the defensive. Charles Townsend was Assistant Colonial Secretary\r\nand she had no mind to allow him to use her with the condescension\r\nwhich, notwithstanding her good manners, she discerned in Mrs. Townsend.\r\nThe room in which they were received was spacious. It was furnished as\r\nwas every other drawing-room she had been in at Tching-Yen in a\r\ncomfortable and homely style. It was a large party. They were the last\r\nto come and as they entered Chinese servants in uniform were handing\r\nround cocktails and olives. Mrs. Townsend greeted them in her casual\r\nfashion and looking at a list told Walter whom he was to take in to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nKitty saw a tall and very handsome man bear down on them.\r\n\r\n"This is my husband."\r\n\r\n"I am to have the privilege of sitting next to you," he said.\r\n\r\nShe immediately felt at ease and the sense of hostility vanished from\r\nher bosom. Though his eyes were smiling she had seen in them a quick\r\nlook of surprise. She understood it perfectly and it made her inclined\r\nto laugh.\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t be able to eat any dinner," he said, "and if I know Dorothy\r\nthe dinner\'s damned good."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I ought to have been told. Some one really ought to have warned me."\r\n\r\n"What about?"\r\n\r\n"No one said a word. How was I to know that I was going to meet a raging\r\nbeauty?"\r\n\r\n"Now what am I to say to that?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. Leave me to do the talking. And I\'ll say it over and over\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nKitty, unmoved, wondered what exactly his wife had told him about her.\r\nHe must have asked. And Townsend, looking down on her with his laughing\r\neyes, suddenly remembered.\r\n\r\n"What is she like?" he had enquired when his wife told him she had met\r\nDr. Fane\'s bride.\r\n\r\n"Oh, quite a nice little thing. Actressy."\r\n\r\n"Was she on the stage?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I don\'t think so. Her father\'s a doctor or a lawyer or\r\nsomething. I suppose we shall have to ask them to dinner."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no hurry, is there?"\r\n\r\nWhen they were sitting side by side at table he told her that he had\r\nknown Walter Fane ever since he came to the Colony.\r\n\r\n"We play bridge together. He\'s far and away the best bridge player at\r\nthe Club."\r\n\r\nShe told Walter on the way home.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not saying very much, you know."\r\n\r\n"How does he play?"\r\n\r\n"Not badly. He plays a winning hand very well, but when he has bad cards\r\nhe goes all to pieces."\r\n\r\n"Does he play as well as you?"\r\n\r\n"I have no illusions about my play. I should describe myself as a very\r\ngood player in the second class. Townsend thinks he\'s in the first. He\r\nisn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you like him?"\r\n\r\n"I neither like him nor dislike him. I believe he\'s not bad at his job\r\nand every one says he\'s a good sportsman. He doesn\'t very much interest\r\nme."\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that Walter\'s moderation had exasperated her.\r\nShe asked herself why it was necessary to be so prudent: you either\r\nliked people or you didn\'t. She had liked Charles Townsend very much.\r\nAnd she had not expected to. He was probably the most popular man in the\r\nColony. It was supposed that the Colonial Secretary would retire soon\r\nand every one hoped that Townsend would succeed him. He played tennis\r\nand polo and golf. He kept racing ponies. He was always ready to do any\r\none a good turn. He never let red tape interfere with him. He put on no\r\nairs. Kitty did not know why she had resented hearing him so well spoken\r\nof, she could not help thinking he must be very conceited: she had been\r\nextremely silly; that was the last thing you could accuse him of.\r\n\r\nShe had enjoyed her evening. They had talked of the theatres in London,\r\nand of Ascot and Cowes, all the things she knew about, so that really\r\nshe might have met him at some nice house in Lennox Gardens; and later,\r\nwhen the men came into the drawing-room after dinner, he had strolled\r\nover and sat beside her again. Though he had not said anything very\r\namusing, he had made her laugh; it must have been the way he said it:\r\nthere was a caressing sound in his deep, rich voice, a delightful\r\nexpression in his kind, shining blue eyes, which made you feel very much\r\nat home with him. Of course he had charm. That was what made him so\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nHe was tall, six foot two at least, she thought, and he had a beautiful\r\nfigure; he was evidently in very good condition and he had not a spare\r\nounce of fat on him. He was well-dressed, the best-dressed man in the\r\nroom, and he wore his clothes well. She liked a man to be smart. Her\r\neyes wandered to Walter: he really should try to be a little better\r\nturned out. She noticed Townsend\'s cuff-links and waistcoat buttons; she\r\nhad seen similar ones at Cartier\'s. Of course the Townsends had private\r\nmeans. His face was deeply sunburned, but the sun had not taken the\r\nhealthy colour from his cheeks. She liked the little trim curly\r\nmoustache which did not conceal his full red lips. He had black hair,\r\nshort and brushed very sleek. But of course his eyes, under thick, bushy\r\neyebrows, were his best feature: they were so very blue, and they had a\r\nlaughing tenderness which persuaded you of the sweetness of his\r\ndisposition. No man who had those blue eyes could bear to hurt any one.\r\n\r\nShe could not but know that she had made an impression on him. If he had\r\nnot said charming things to her his eyes, warm with admiration,\r\nwould have betrayed him. His ease was delightful. He had no\r\nself-consciousness. Kitty was at home in these circumstances and she\r\nadmired the way in which amid the banter which was the staple of their\r\nconversation he insinuated every now and then a pretty, flattering speech.\r\nWhen she shook hands with him on leaving he gave her hand a pressure\r\nthat she could not mistake.\r\n\r\n"I hope we shall see you again soon," he said casually but his eyes gave\r\nhis words a meaning which she could not fail to see.\r\n\r\n"Tching-Yen is very small, isn\'t it?" she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xv_\r\n\r\n\r\nWho would have thought then that within three months they would be on\r\nsuch terms? He had told her since that he was crazy about her on that\r\nfirst evening. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He\r\nremembered the dress she wore; it was her wedding dress, and he said she\r\nlooked like a lily of the valley. She knew that he was in love with her\r\nbefore he told her, and a little frightened she kept him at a distance.\r\nHe was impetuous and it was difficult. She was afraid to let him kiss\r\nher, for the thought of his arms about her made her heart beat so fast.\r\nShe had never been in love before. It was wonderful. And now that she\r\nknew what love was she felt a sudden sympathy for the love that Walter\r\nbore her. She teased him, playfully, and saw that he enjoyed it. She had\r\nbeen perhaps a little afraid of him, but now she had more confidence.\r\nShe chaffed him and it amused her to see the slow smile with which at\r\nfirst he received her banter. He was surprised and pleased. One of these\r\ndays, she thought, he would become quite human. Now that she had learnt\r\nsomething of passion it diverted her to play lightly, like a harpist\r\nrunning his fingers across the strings of his harp, on his affections.\r\nShe laughed when she saw how she bewildered and confused him.\r\n\r\nAnd when Charlie became her lover the situation between herself and\r\nWalter seemed exquisitely absurd. She could hardly look at him, so grave\r\nand self-controlled, without laughing. She was too happy to feel\r\nunkindly towards him. Except for him, after all, she would never have\r\nknown Charlie. She had hesitated some time before the final step, not\r\nbecause she did not want to yield to Charlie\'s passion, her own was\r\nequal to his, but because her upbringing and all the conventions of her\r\nlife intimidated her. She was amazed afterwards (and the final act was\r\ndue to accident; neither of them had seen the opportunity till it was\r\nface to face with them) to discover that she felt in no way different\r\nfrom what she had before. She had expected that it would cause some, she\r\nhardly knew what, fantastic change in her so that she would feel like\r\nsomebody else; and when she had a chance to look at herself in the glass\r\nshe was bewildered to see the same woman she had seen the day before.\r\n\r\n"Are you angry with me?" he asked her.\r\n\r\n"I adore you," she whispered.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think you were very silly to waste so much time?"\r\n\r\n"A perfect fool."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xvi_\r\n\r\n\r\nHer happiness, sometimes almost more than she could bear, renewed her\r\nbeauty. Just before she married, beginning to lose her first freshness,\r\nshe had looked tired and drawn. The uncharitable said that she was going\r\noff. But there is all the difference between a girl of twenty-five and a\r\nmarried woman of that age. She was like a rosebud that is beginning to\r\nturn yellow at the edges of the petals, and then suddenly she was a rose\r\nin full bloom. Her starry eyes gained a more significant expression; her\r\nskin (that feature which had always been her greatest pride and most\r\nanxious care) was dazzling: it could not be compared to the peach or to\r\nthe flower; it was they that demanded comparison with it. She looked\r\neighteen once more. She was at the height of her glowing loveliness. It\r\nwas impossible not to remark it and her women friends asked her in\r\nlittle friendly asides if she was going to have a baby. The indifferent\r\nwho had said she was just a very pretty woman with a long nose admitted\r\nthat they had misjudged her. She was what Charlie had called her the\r\nfirst time he saw her, a raging beauty.\r\n\r\nThey managed their intrigue with skill. He had a broad back, he told her\r\n("I will not have you swank about your figure," she interrupted\r\nlightly), and it did not matter about him; but for her sake they mustn\'t\r\ntake the smallest risk. They could not meet often alone, not half often\r\nenough for him, but he had to think of her first, sometimes in the curio\r\nshop, now and then after luncheon in her house when no one was about;\r\nbut she saw him a good deal here and there. It amused her then to see\r\nthe formal way he spoke to her, jovial, for he was always that, with the\r\nsame manner he used with every one. Who could imagine when they heard\r\nhim chaff her with that charming humour of his that so lately he had\r\nheld her in his passionate arms?\r\n\r\nShe worshipped him. He was splendid, in his smart top boots and his\r\nwhite breeches, when he played polo. In tennis clothes he looked a mere\r\nboy. Of course he was proud of his figure: it was the best figure she\r\nhad ever seen. He took pains to keep it. He never ate bread or potatoes\r\nor butter. And he took a great deal of exercise. She liked the care he\r\ntook of his hands; he was manicured once a week. He was a wonderful\r\nathlete and the year before he had won the local tennis championship.\r\nCertainly he was the best dancer she had ever danced with; it was a\r\ndream to dance with him. No one would think he was forty. She told him\r\nshe did not believe it.\r\n\r\n"I believe it\'s all bluff and you\'re really twenty-five."\r\n\r\nHe laughed. He was well pleased.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, I have a boy of fifteen. I\'m a middle-aged gent. In\r\nanother two or three years I shall just be a fat old party."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be adorable when you\'re a hundred."\r\n\r\nShe liked his black, bushy eyebrows. She wondered whether it was they\r\nthat gave his blue eyes their disturbing expression.\r\n\r\nHe was full of accomplishments. He could play the piano quite well,\r\nrag-time, of course, and he could sing a comic song with a rich voice\r\nand good humour. She did not believe there was anything he could not do.\r\nHe was very clever at his work too and she shared his pleasure when he\r\ntold her that the Governor had particularly congratulated him on the way\r\nhe had done some difficult job.\r\n\r\n"Although it\'s I as says it," he laughed, his eyes charming with the\r\nlove he bore her, "there\'s not a fellow in the Service who could have\r\ndone it better."\r\n\r\nOh, how she wished that she were his wife rather than Walter\'s!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xvii_\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course it was not certain yet that Walter knew the truth, and if he\r\ndidn\'t it was better perhaps to leave well alone; but if he did, well,\r\nin the end it would be the best thing for all of them. At first she had\r\nbeen, if not satisfied, at least resigned to seeing Charlie only by\r\nstealth; but time had increased her passion and for some while now she\r\nhad been increasingly impatient of the obstacles which prevented them\r\nfrom being always together. He had told her so often that he cursed his\r\nposition which forced him to be so discreet, the ties which bound him,\r\nand the ties which bound her: how marvellous it would have been, he\r\nsaid, if they were both free! She saw his point of view; no one wanted a\r\nscandal, and of course it required a good deal of thinking over before\r\nyou changed the course of your life; but if freedom were thrust upon\r\nthem, ah, then, how simple everything would be!\r\n\r\nIt was not as though any one would suffer very much. She knew exactly\r\nwhat his relations were with his wife. She was a cold woman and there\r\nhad been no love between them for years. It was habit that held them\r\ntogether, convenience, and of course the children. It was easier for\r\nCharlie than for her: Walter loved her; but after all, he was absorbed\r\nin his work; and a man always had his club, he might be upset at first,\r\nbut he would get over it; there was no reason why he should not marry\r\nsomebody else. Charlie had told her that he could not make out how she\r\ncame to throw herself away on Walter Fane.\r\n\r\nShe wondered, half smiling, why a little while before she had been\r\nterrified at the thought that Walter had caught them. Of course it was\r\nstartling to see the handle of the door slowly turn. But after all they\r\nknew the worst that Walter could do, and they were ready for it. Charlie\r\nwould feel as great a relief as she that what they both desired more\r\nthan anything in the world should be thus forced upon them.\r\n\r\nWalter was a gentleman, she would do him the justice to acknowledge\r\nthat, and he loved her; he would do the right thing and allow her to\r\ndivorce him. They had made a mistake and the lucky thing was that they\r\nhad found it out before it was too late. She made up her mind exactly\r\nwhat she was going to say to him and how she would treat him. She would\r\nbe kind, smiling, and firm. There was no need for them to quarrel. Later\r\non she would always be glad to see him. She hoped honestly that the two\r\nyears they had spent together would remain with him as a priceless\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose Dorothy Townsend will mind divorcing Charlie a bit,"\r\nshe thought. "Now the youngest boy is going back to England it will be\r\nmuch nicer for her to be in England too. There\'s absolutely nothing for\r\nher to do in Tching-Yen. She\'ll be able to spend all the holidays with\r\nher boys. And then she\'s got her father and mother in England."\r\n\r\nIt was all very simple and everything could be managed without scandal\r\nor ill-feeling. And then she and Charlie could marry. Kitty drew a long\r\nsigh. They would be very happy. It was worth going through a certain\r\namount of bother to achieve that. Confusedly, one picture jostling\r\nanother, she thought of the life they would lead together, of the fun\r\nthey would have and the little journeys they would take together, the\r\nhouse they would live in, the positions he would rise to and the help\r\nshe would be to him. He would be very proud of her and she, she adored\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut through all these day-dreams ran a current of apprehension. It was\r\nfunny: it was as though the wood and the strings of an orchestra played\r\nArcadian melodies and in the bass the drums, softly but with foreboding,\r\nbeat a grim tattoo. Sooner or later Walter must come home and her heart\r\nbeat fast at the thought of meeting him. It was strange that he had gone\r\naway that afternoon without saying a word to her. Of course she was not\r\nfrightened of him; after all what could he do, she repeated to herself;\r\nbut she could not quite allay her uneasiness. Once more she repeated\r\nwhat she would say to him. What was the good of making a scene? She was\r\nvery sorry, Heaven knew she didn\'t want to cause him pain, but she\r\ncouldn\'t help it if she didn\'t love him. It was no good pretending and\r\nit was always better to tell the truth. She hoped he wouldn\'t be\r\nunhappy, but they had made a mistake and the only sensible thing was to\r\nacknowledge it. She would always think kindly of him.\r\n\r\nBut even as she said this to herself a sudden gust of fear made the\r\nsweat start out in the palms of her hands. And because she was\r\nfrightened she grew angry with him. If he wanted to make a scene, that\r\nwas his lookout; he must not be surprised if he got more than he\r\nbargained for. She would tell him that she had never cared two pins for\r\nhim and that not a day had passed since their marriage without her\r\nregretting it. He was dull. Oh, how he\'d bored her, bored her, bored\r\nher! He thought himself so much better than anyone else, it was\r\nlaughable; he had no sense of humour; she hated his supercilious air,\r\nhis coldness, and his self-control. It was easy to be self-controlled\r\nwhen you were interested in nothing and nobody but yourself. He was\r\nrepulsive to her. She hated to let him kiss her. What had he to be so\r\nconceited about? He danced rottenly, he was a wet blanket at a party, he\r\ncouldn\'t play or sing, he couldn\'t play polo and his tennis was no\r\nbetter than anybody else\'s. Bridge? Who cared about bridge?\r\n\r\nKitty worked herself up into a towering passion. Let him dare to\r\nreproach her. All that had happened was his own fault. She was thankful\r\nthat he knew the truth at last. She hated him and wished never to see\r\nhim again. Yes, she was thankful that it was all over. Why couldn\'t he\r\nleave her alone? He had pestered her into marrying him and now she was\r\nfed up.\r\n\r\n"Fed up," she repeated aloud, trembling with anger. "Fed up! Fed up!"\r\n\r\nShe heard the car draw up to the gate of their garden. He was coming up\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xviii_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe came into the room. Her heart was beating wildly and her hands were\r\nshaking; it was lucky that she lay on the sofa. She was holding an open\r\nbook as though she had been reading. He stood for an instant on the\r\nthreshold and their eyes met. Her heart sank; she felt on a sudden a\r\ncold chill pass through her limbs and she shivered. She had that feeling\r\nwhich you describe by saying that someone was walking over your grave.\r\nHis face was deathly pale; she had seen it like that once before, when\r\nthey sat together in the Park and he asked her to marry him. His dark\r\neyes, immobile and inscrutable, seemed preternaturally large. He knew\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n"You\'re back early," she remarked.\r\n\r\nHer lips trembled so that she could hardly frame the words. She was\r\nterrified. She was afraid she would faint.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s about the usual time."\r\n\r\nHis voice sounded strange to her. It was raised on the last word in\r\norder to give his remark a casual air, but it was forced. She wondered\r\nif he saw that she was shaking in every limb. It was only by an effort\r\nthat she did not scream. He dropped his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just going to dress."\r\n\r\nHe left the room. She was shattered. For two or three minutes she could\r\nnot stir, but at last, raising herself from the sofa with difficulty, as\r\nthough she had had an illness and were still weak, she found her feet.\r\nShe did not know if her legs would support her. She felt her way by\r\nmeans of chairs and tables to the veranda and then with one hand on the\r\nwall went to her room. She put on a tea-gown and when she went back into\r\nher boudoir (they only used the drawing-room when there was a party) he\r\nwas standing at a table looking at the pictures of the _Sketch_. She had\r\nto force herself to enter.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go down? Dinner is ready."\r\n\r\n"Have I kept you waiting?"\r\n\r\nIt was dreadful that she could not control the trembling of her lips.\r\n\r\nWhen was he going to speak?\r\n\r\nThey sat down and for a moment there was silence between them. Then he\r\nmade a remark and because it was so commonplace it had a sinister air.\r\n\r\n"The _Empress_ didn\'t come in to-day," he said. "I wonder if she\'s been\r\ndelayed by a storm."\r\n\r\n"Was she due to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him now and saw that his eyes were fixed on his plate. He\r\nmade another observation, equally trivial, about a tennis tournament\r\nthat was about to be played, and he spoke at length. His voice as a rule\r\nwas agreeable, with a variety of tone, but now he spoke on one note. It\r\nwas strangely unnatural. It gave Kitty the impression that he was\r\nspeaking from a long way off. And all the time his eyes were directed to\r\nhis plate, or the table, or to a picture on the wall. He would not meet\r\nhers. She realised that he could not bear to look at her.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go upstairs?" he said when dinner was finished.\r\n\r\n"If you like."\r\n\r\nShe rose and he held open the door for her. His eyes were cast down as\r\nshe passed him. When they reached the sitting-room he took up the\r\nillustrated paper once more.\r\n\r\n"Is this a new _Sketch_? I don\'t think I\'ve seen it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I haven\'t noticed."\r\n\r\nIt had been lying about for a fortnight and she knew that he had looked\r\nit through and through. He took it and sat down. She lay again on the\r\nsofa and took her book. As a rule in the evening, when they were alone,\r\nthey played coon-can or patience. He was leaning back in an arm-chair,\r\nin a comfortable attitude, and his attention seemed absorbed by the\r\nillustration he was looking at. He did not turn the page. She tried to\r\nread, but she could not see the print before her eyes. The words were\r\nblurred. Her head began to ache violently.\r\n\r\nWhen would he speak?\r\n\r\nThey sat in silence for an hour. She gave up the pretence of reading,\r\nand letting her novel fall on her lap, gazed into space. She was afraid\r\nto make the smallest gesture or the smallest sound. He sat quite still,\r\nin that same easy attitude, and stared with those wide, immobile eyes of\r\nhis at the picture. His stillness was strangely menacing. It gave Kitty\r\nthe feeling of a wild beast prepared to spring.\r\n\r\nWhen suddenly he stood up she started. She clenched her hands and she\r\nfelt herself grow pale. Now!\r\n\r\n"I have some work to do," he said in that quiet, toneless voice, his\r\neyes averted. "If you don\'t mind I\'ll go into my study. I daresay you\'ll\r\nhave gone to bed by the time I\'ve finished."\r\n\r\n"I _am_ rather tired to-night."\r\n\r\n"Well, good night."\r\n\r\n"Good night."\r\n\r\nHe left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xix_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as she could next morning she rang Townsend up at his office.\r\n\r\n"Yes, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"I want to see you."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I\'m awfully busy. I\'m a working man."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very important. Can I come down to the office?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I wouldn\'t do that if I were you."\r\n\r\n"Well, come here then."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t possibly get away. What about this afternoon? And don\'t you\r\nthink it would be better if I didn\'t come to your house?"\r\n\r\n"I must see you at once."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause and she was afraid that she had been cut off.\r\n\r\n"Are you there?" she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was thinking. Has anything happened?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you over the telephone."\r\n\r\nThere was another silence before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n"Well, look here, I can manage to see you for ten minutes at one if\r\nthat\'ll do. You\'d better go to Ku-Chou\'s and I\'ll come along as soon as\r\nI can."\r\n\r\n"The curio shop?" she asked in dismay.\r\n\r\n"Well, we can\'t meet in the lounge at the Tching Yen Hotel very well,"\r\nhe answered.\r\n\r\nShe noticed a trace of irritation in his voice.\r\n\r\n"Very well. I\'ll go to Ku-Chou\'s."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xx_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe got out of her rickshaw in the Victoria Road and walked up the\r\nsteep, narrow lane till she came to the shop. She lingered outside a\r\nmoment as though her attention were attracted by the bric-\xc3\xa0-brac which\r\nwas displayed. But a boy who was standing there on the watch for\r\ncustomers, recognising her at once, gave her a broad smile of\r\nconnivance. He said something in Chinese to someone within and the\r\nmaster, a little, fat-faced man in a black gown, came out and greeted\r\nher. She walked in quickly.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Townsend no come yet. You go top-side, yes?"\r\n\r\nShe went to the back of the shop and walked up the rickety, dark stairs.\r\nThe Chinese followed her and unlocked the door that led into the\r\nbedroom. It was stuffy and there was an acrid smell of opium. She sat\r\ndown on a sandalwood chest.\r\n\r\nIn a moment she heard a heavy step on the creaking stairs. Townsend came\r\nin and shut the door behind him. His face bore a sullen look, but as he\r\nsaw her it vanished, and he smiled in that charming way of his. He took\r\nher quickly in his arms and kissed her lips.\r\n\r\n"Now what\'s the trouble?"\r\n\r\n"It makes me feel better just to see you," she smiled.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the bed and lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"You look rather washed out this morning."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder," she answered. "I don\'t think I closed my eyes all\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nHe gave her a look. He was smiling still, but his smile was a little set\r\nand unnatural. She thought there was a shade of anxiety in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"He knows," she said.\r\n\r\nThere was an instant\'s pause before he answered.\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t said anything."\r\n\r\n"What!" He looked at her sharply. "What makes you think he knows then?"\r\n\r\n"Everything. His look. The way he talked at dinner."\r\n\r\n"Was he disagreeable?"\r\n\r\n"No, on the contrary, he was scrupulously polite. For the first time\r\nsince we married he didn\'t kiss me good night."\r\n\r\nShe dropped her eyes. She was not sure if Charlie understood. As a rule\r\nWalter took her in his arms and pressed his lips to hers and would not\r\nlet them go. His whole body grew tender and passionate with his kiss.\r\n\r\n"Why do you imagine he didn\'t say anything?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Kitty sat very still on the sandalwood box and looked\r\nwith anxious attention at Townsend. His face once more was sullen and\r\nthere was a frown between his brows. His mouth drooped a little at the\r\ncorners. But all at once he looked up and a gleam of malicious amusement\r\ncame into his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if he _is_ going to say anything."\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. She did not know what he meant.\r\n\r\n"After all, he wouldn\'t be the first man who\'s shut his eyes in a case\r\nof this sort. What has he to gain by making a row? If he\'d wanted to\r\nmake a row he would have insisted on coming into your room." His eyes\r\ntwinkled and his lips broke into a broad smile. "We should have looked a\r\npair of damned fools."\r\n\r\n"I wish you could have seen his face last night."\r\n\r\n"I expect he was upset. It was naturally a shock. It\'s a damned\r\nhumiliating position for any man. He always looks a fool. Walter doesn\'t\r\ngive me the impression of a fellow who\'d care to wash a lot of dirty\r\nlinen in public."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he would," she answered reflectively. "He\'s very\r\nsensitive, I\'ve discovered that."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all to the good as far as we\'re concerned. You know, it\'s a very\r\ngood plan to put yourself in somebody else\'s shoes and ask yourself how\r\nyou would act in his place. There\'s only one way in which a man can save\r\nhis face when he\'s in that sort of position and that is to pretend he\r\nknows nothing. I bet you anything you like that that is exactly what\r\nhe\'s going to do."\r\n\r\nThe more Townsend talked the more buoyant he became. His blue eyes\r\nsparkled and he was once more his gay and jovial self. He irradiated an\r\nencouraging confidence.\r\n\r\n"Heaven knows, I don\'t want to say anything disagreeable about him, but\r\nwhen you come down to brass tacks a bacteriologist is no great shakes.\r\nThe chances are that I shall be Colonial Secretary when Simmons goes\r\nhome, and it\'s to Walter\'s interest to keep on the right side of me.\r\nHe\'s got his bread and butter to think of, like the rest of us: do you\r\nthink the Colonial Office are going to do much for a fellow who makes a\r\nscandal? Believe me, he\'s got everything to gain by holding his tongue\r\nand everything to lose by kicking up a row."\r\n\r\nKitty moved uneasily. She knew how shy Walter was and she could believe\r\nthat the fear of a scene, and the dread of public attention, might have\r\ninfluence upon him; but she could not believe that he would be affected\r\nby the thought of a material advantage. Perhaps she didn\'t know him very\r\nwell, but Charlie didn\'t know him at all.\r\n\r\n"Has it occurred to you that he\'s madly in love with me?"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, but he smiled at her with roguish eyes. She knew and\r\nloved that charming look of his.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is it? I know you\'re going to say something awful."\r\n\r\n"Well, you know, women are often under the impression that men are much\r\nmore madly in love with them than they really are."\r\n\r\nFor the first time she laughed. His confidence was catching.\r\n\r\n"What a monstrous thing to say!"\r\n\r\n"I put it to you that you haven\'t been bothering much about your husband\r\nlately. Perhaps he isn\'t quite so much in love with you as he was."\r\n\r\n"At all events I shall never delude myself that _you_ are madly in love\r\nwith me," she retorted.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where you\'re wrong."\r\n\r\nAh, how good it was to hear him say that! She knew it and her belief in\r\nhis passion warmed her heart. As he spoke he rose from the bed and came\r\nand sat down beside her on the sandalwood box. He put his arm round her\r\nwaist.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry your silly little head a moment longer," he said. "I\r\npromise you there\'s nothing to fear. I\'m as certain as I am of anything\r\nthat he\'s going to pretend he knows nothing. You know, this sort of\r\nthing is awfully difficult to prove. You say he\'s in love with you;\r\nperhaps he doesn\'t want to lose you altogether. I swear I\'d accept\r\nanything rather than that if you were my wife."\r\n\r\nShe leaned towards him. Her body became limp and yielding against his\r\narm. The love she felt for him was almost torture. His last words had\r\nstruck her: perhaps Walter loved her so passionately that he was\r\nprepared to accept any humiliation if sometimes she would let him love\r\nher. She could understand that; for that was how she felt towards\r\nCharlie. A thrill of pride passed through her, and at the same time a\r\nfaint sensation of contempt for a man who could love so slavishly.\r\n\r\nShe put her arm lovingly round Charlie\'s neck.\r\n\r\n"You\'re simply wonderful. I was shaking like a leaf when I came here and\r\nyou\'ve made everything all right."\r\n\r\nHe took her face in his hand and kissed her lips.\r\n\r\n"Darling."\r\n\r\n"You\'re such a comfort to me," she sighed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you need not be nervous. And you know I\'ll stand by you. I\r\nwon\'t let you down."\r\n\r\nShe put away her fears, but for an instant unreasonably she regretted\r\nthat her plans for the future were shattered. Now that all danger was\r\npast she almost wished that Walter were going to insist on a divorce.\r\n\r\n"I knew I could count on you," she said.\r\n\r\n"So I should hope."\r\n\r\n"Oughtn\'t you to go and have your tiffin?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, damn my tiffin."\r\n\r\nHe drew her more closely to him and now she was held tight in his arms.\r\nHis mouth sought hers.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Charlie, you must let me go."\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh, a laugh of happy love and of triumph; his eyes\r\nwere heavy with desire. He lifted her to her feet and not letting her go\r\nbut holding her close to his breast he locked the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxi_\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the afternoon she thought of what Charlie had said about\r\nWalter. They were dining out that evening and when he came back from the\r\nClub she was dressing. He knocked at her door.\r\n\r\n"Come in."\r\n\r\nHe did not open.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going straight along to dress. How long will you be?"\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes."\r\n\r\nHe said nothing more, but went to his own room. His voice had that\r\nconstrained note which she had heard in it the night before. She felt\r\nfairly sure of herself now. She was ready before he was and when he came\r\ndownstairs she was already seated in the car.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'ve kept you waiting," he said.\r\n\r\n"I shall survive it," she replied, and she was able to smile as she spoke.\r\n\r\nShe made an observation or two as they drove down the hill, but he\r\nanswered curtly. She shrugged her shoulders; she was growing a trifle\r\nimpatient: if he wanted to sulk, let him, she didn\'t care. They drove in\r\nsilence till they reached their destination. It was a large dinner\r\nparty. There were too many people and too many courses. While Kitty\r\nchatted gaily with her neighbours she watched Walter. He was deathly\r\npale and his face was pinched.\r\n\r\n"Your husband is looking rather washed out. I thought he didn\'t mind the\r\nheat. Has he been working very hard?"\r\n\r\n"He always works hard."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re going away soon?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I think I shall go to Japan as I did last year," she said.\r\n"The doctor says I must get out of the heat if I don\'t want to go all to\r\npieces."\r\n\r\nWalter did not as usual when they were dining out give her a little\r\nsmiling glance now and then. He never looked at her. She had noticed\r\nthat when he came down to the car he kept his eyes averted, and he did\r\nthe same when, with his usual politeness, he gave her his hand to\r\nalight. Now, talking with the women on either side of him, he did not\r\nsmile, but looked at them with steady and unblinking eyes; and really\r\nhis eyes looked enormous and in that pale face coal black. His face was\r\nset and stern.\r\n\r\n"He must be an agreeable companion," thought Kitty ironically.\r\n\r\nThe idea of those unfortunate ladies trying to indulge in small talk\r\nwith that grim mask not a little diverted her.\r\n\r\nOf course he knew; there was no doubt about that, and he was furious\r\nwith her. Why hadn\'t he said anything? Was it really because, though\r\nangry and hurt, he loved her as much that he was afraid she would leave\r\nhim. The thought made her ever so slightly despise him, but\r\ngood-naturedly: after all, he was her husband and he provided her with\r\nboard and lodging; so long as he didn\'t interfere with her and let her\r\ndo as she liked she would be quite nice to him. On the other hand,\r\nperhaps his silence was due merely to a morbid timidity. Charlie was\r\nright when he said that no one would hate a scandal more than Walter. He\r\nnever made a speech if he could help it. He had told her once that when\r\nhe was subp\xc5\x93naed as a witness on a case where he was to give expert\r\nevidence he had hardly slept for a week before. His shyness was a\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another thing: men were very vain, and so long as no one\r\nknew what had happened it might be that Walter would be content to\r\nignore it. Then she wondered whether by any possibility Charlie was\r\nright when he suggested that Walter knew which side his bread was\r\nbuttered. Charlie was the most popular man in the Colony and soon would\r\nbe Colonial Secretary. He could be very useful to Walter; on the other\r\nhand he could make himself very unpleasant if Walter put his back up.\r\nHer heart exulted as she thought of her lover\'s strength and\r\ndetermination; she felt so defenceless in his virile arms. Men were\r\nstrange: it would never have occurred to her that Walter was capable of\r\nsuch baseness, and yet you never knew; perhaps his seriousness was\r\nmerely a mask for a mean and pettifogging nature. The more she\r\nconsidered it the more likely it seemed that Charlie was right; and she\r\nturned her glance once more on her husband. There was no indulgence in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt happened that just then the women on either side of him were talking\r\nwith their neighbours and he was left alone. He was staring straight in\r\nfront of him, forgetful of the party, and his eyes were filled with a\r\nmortal sadness. It gave Kitty a shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxii_\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day when she was lying down after luncheon dozing, she was aroused\r\nby a knock at her door.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" she cried irritably.\r\n\r\nAt that hour she was unaccustomed to be disturbed.\r\n\r\n"I."\r\n\r\nShe recognized her husband\'s voice and she sat up quickly.\r\n\r\n"Come in."\r\n\r\n"Did I wake you?" he asked as he entered.\r\n\r\n"In point of fact you did," she answered in the natural tone she had\r\nadopted with him for the last two days.\r\n\r\n"Will you come into the next room? I want to have a little talk with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHer heart gave a sudden beat against her ribs.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll put on a dressing-gown."\r\n\r\nHe left her. She slipped her bare feet into mules and wrapped herself in\r\na kimono. She looked in the glass; she was very pale and she put on some\r\nrouge. She stood at the door for a moment, nerving herself for the\r\ninterview, and then with a bold face joined him.\r\n\r\n"How did you manage to get away from the Laboratory at this hour?" she\r\nsaid. "I don\'t often see you at this sort of time."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you sit down?"\r\n\r\nHe did not look at her. He spoke gravely. She was glad to do as he\r\nasked: her knees were a little shaky, and unable to continue in that\r\njocular tone she kept silent. He sat also and lit a cigarette. His eyes\r\nwandered restlessly about the room. He seemed to have some difficulty in\r\nstarting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he looked full at her; and because he had held his eyes so long\r\naverted, his direct gaze gave her such a fright that she smothered a\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever heard of Mei-tan-fu?" he asked. "There\'s been a good deal\r\nabout it in the papers lately."\r\n\r\nShe stared at him in astonishment. She hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Is that the place where there\'s cholera? Mr. Arbuthnot was talking\r\nabout it last night."\r\n\r\n"There\'s an epidemic. I believe it\'s the worst they\'ve had for years.\r\nThere was a medical missionary there. He died of cholera three days ago.\r\nThere\'s a French convent there and of course there\'s the Customs man.\r\nEveryone else has got out."\r\n\r\nHis eyes were still fixed on her and she could not lower hers. She tried\r\nto read his expression, but she was nervous, and she could only discern\r\na strange watchfulness. How could he look so steadily? He did not even\r\nblink.\r\n\r\n"The French nuns are doing what they can. They\'ve turned the orphanage\r\ninto a hospital. But the people are dying like flies. I\'ve offered to go\r\nand take charge."\r\n\r\n"You?"\r\n\r\nShe started violently. Her first thought was that if he went she would\r\nbe free and without let or hindrance could see Charlie. But the thought\r\nshocked her. She felt herself go scarlet. Why did he watch her like\r\nthat? She looked away in embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Is that necessary?" she faltered.\r\n\r\n"There\'s not a foreign doctor in the place."\r\n\r\n"But you\'re not a doctor, you\'re a bacteriologist."\r\n\r\n"I am an M.D., you know, and before I specialised I did a good deal of\r\ngeneral work in a hospital. The fact that I\'m first and foremost a\r\nbacteriologist is all to the good. It will be an admirable chance for\r\nresearch work."\r\n\r\nHe spoke almost flippantly and when she glanced at him she was surprised\r\nto see in his eyes a gleam of mockery. She could not understand.\r\n\r\n"But won\'t it be awfully dangerous?"\r\n\r\n"Awfully."\r\n\r\nHe smiled. It was a derisive grimace. She leaned her forehead on her\r\nhand. Suicide. It was nothing short of that. Dreadful! She had not\r\nthought he would take it like that. She couldn\'t let him do that. It was\r\ncruel. It was not her fault if she did not love him. She couldn\'t bear\r\nthe thought that he should kill himself for her sake. Tears flowed\r\nsoftly down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"What are you crying for?"\r\n\r\nHis voice was cold.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not obliged to go, are you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I go of my own free will."\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t, Walter. It would be too awful if something happened.\r\nSupposing you died?"\r\n\r\nThough his face remained impassive the shadow of a smile once more\r\ncrossed his eyes. He did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Where is this place?" she asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Mei-tan-fu? It\'s on a tributary of the Western River. We should go up\r\nthe Western River and then by chair."\r\n\r\n"Who is we?"\r\n\r\n"You and I."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly. She thought she had heard amiss. But now the\r\nsmile in his eyes had travelled to his lips. His dark eyes were fixed on\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Are you expecting me to come too?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you\'d like to."\r\n\r\nHer breath began to come very fast. A shudder passed through her.\r\n\r\n"But surely it\'s no place for a woman. The missionary sent his wife and\r\nchildren down weeks ago and the A. P. C. man and his wife came down. I\r\nmet her at a tea-party. I\'ve just remembered that she said they left\r\nsome place on account of cholera."\r\n\r\n"There are five French nuns there."\r\n\r\nPanic seized her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean. It would be madness for me to go. You know\r\nhow delicate I am. Dr. Hayward said I must get out of Tching-Yen on\r\naccount of the heat. I could never stand the heat up there. And cholera.\r\nI should be frightened out of my wits. It\'s just asking for trouble.\r\nThere\'s no reason for me to go. I should die."\r\n\r\nHe did not answer. She looked at him in her desperation and she could\r\nhardly restrain a cry. His face had a sort of black pallor which\r\nsuddenly terrified her. She saw in it a look of hatred. Was it possible\r\nthat he wanted her to die? She answered her own outrageous thought.\r\n\r\n"It\'s absurd. If you think you ought to go it\'s your own lookout. But\r\nreally you can\'t expect me to. I hate illness. A cholera epidemic. I\r\ndon\'t pretend to be very brave and I don\'t mind telling you that I\r\nhaven\'t pluck for that. I shall stay here until it\'s time for me to go\r\nto Japan."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought that you would want to accompany me when I am\r\nabout to set out on a dangerous expedition."\r\n\r\nHe was openly mocking her now. She was confused. She did not quite know\r\nwhether he meant what he said or was merely trying to frighten her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think anyone could reasonably blame me for refusing to go to a\r\ndangerous place where I had no business or where I could be of no use."\r\n\r\n"You could be of the greatest use; you could cheer and comfort me."\r\n\r\nShe grew even a little paler.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand what you\'re talking about."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have thought it needed more than average intelligence."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going, Walter. It\'s monstrous to ask me."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall not go either. I shall immediately file my petition."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxiii_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked at him blankly. What he said was so unexpected that at the\r\nfirst moment she could hardly gather its sense.\r\n\r\n"What on earth are you talking about?" she faltered.\r\n\r\nEven to herself her reply rang false, and she saw the look of disdain\r\nwhich it called forth on Walter\'s stern face.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'ve thought me a bigger fool than I am."\r\n\r\nShe did not quite know what to say. She was undecided whether\r\nindignantly to assert her innocence or to break out into angry\r\nreproaches. He seemed to read her thoughts.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got all the proof necessary."\r\n\r\nShe began to cry. The tears flowed from her eyes without any particular\r\nanguish and she did not dry them: to weep gave her a little time to\r\ncollect herself. But her mind was blank. He watched her without concern,\r\nand his calmness frightened her. He grew impatient.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to do much good by crying, you know."\r\n\r\nHis voice, so cold and hard, had the effect of exciting in her a certain\r\nindignation. She was recovering her nerve.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care. I suppose you have no objection to my divorcing you. It\r\nmeans nothing to a man."\r\n\r\n"Will you allow me to ask why I should put myself to the smallest\r\ninconvenience on your account?"\r\n\r\n"It can\'t make any difference to you. It\'s not much to ask you to behave\r\nlike a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"I have much too great a regard for your welfare."\r\n\r\nShe sat up now and dried her eyes.\r\n\r\n"What _do_ you mean?" she asked him.\r\n\r\n"Townsend will marry you only if he is correspondent and the case is so\r\nshameless that his wife is forced to divorce him."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what you\'re talking about," she cried.\r\n\r\n"You stupid fool."\r\n\r\nHis tone was so contemptuous that she flushed with anger. And perhaps\r\nher anger was greater because she had never before heard him say to her\r\nany but sweet, flattering and delightful things. She had been accustomed\r\nto find him subservient to all her whims.\r\n\r\n"If you want the truth you can have it. He\'s only too anxious to marry\r\nme. Dorothy Townsend is perfectly willing to divorce him and we shall be\r\nmarried the moment we\'re free."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you that in so many words or is that the impression you\r\nhave gained from his manner?"\r\n\r\nWalter\'s eyes shone with bitter mockery. They made Kitty a trifle\r\nuneasy. She was not quite sure that Charlie had ever said exactly that\r\nin so many words.\r\n\r\n"He\'s said it over and over again."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a lie and you know it\'s a lie."\r\n\r\n"He loves me with all his heart and soul. He loves me as passionately as\r\nI love him. You\'ve found out. I\'m not going to deny anything. Why should\r\nI? We\'ve been lovers for a year and I\'m proud of it. He means everything\r\nin the world to me and I\'m glad that you know at last. We\'re sick to\r\ndeath of secrecy and compromise and all the rest of it. It was a mistake\r\nthat I ever married you, I never should have done it, I was a fool. I\r\nnever cared for you. We never had anything in common. I don\'t like the\r\npeople you like and I\'m bored by the things that interest you. I\'m\r\nthankful it\'s finished."\r\n\r\nHe watched her without a gesture and without a movement of his face. He\r\nlistened attentively and no change in his expression showed that what\r\nshe said affected him.\r\n\r\n"Do you know why I married you?"\r\n\r\n"Because you wanted to be married before your sister Doris."\r\n\r\nIt was true, but it gave her a funny little turn to realise that he knew\r\nit. Oddly enough, even in that moment of fear and anger, it excited her\r\ncompassion. He faintly smiled.\r\n\r\n"I had no illusions about you," he said. "I knew you were silly and\r\nfrivolous and empty-headed. But I loved you. I knew that your aims and\r\nideals were vulgar and commonplace. But I loved you. I knew that you\r\nwere second-rate. But I loved you. It\'s comic when I think how hard I\r\ntried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious I was\r\nto hide from you that I wasn\'t ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering\r\nand stupid. I knew how frightened you were of intelligence and I did\r\neverything I could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the\r\nmen you knew. I knew that you\'d only married me for convenience. I loved\r\nyou so much, I didn\'t care. Most people, as far as I can see, when\r\nthey\'re in love with someone and the love isn\'t returned feel that they\r\nhave a grievance. They grow angry and bitter. I wasn\'t like that. I\r\nnever expected you to love me, I didn\'t see any reason that you should,\r\nI never thought myself very lovable. I was thankful to be allowed to\r\nlove you and I was enraptured when now and then I thought you were\r\npleased with me or when I noticed in your eyes a gleam of good-humoured\r\naffection. I tried not to bore you with my love; I knew I couldn\'t\r\nafford to do that and I was always on the lookout for the first sign\r\nthat you were impatient with my affection. What most husbands expect as\r\na right I was prepared to receive as a favour."\r\n\r\nKitty, accustomed to flattery all her life, had never heard such things\r\nsaid to her before. Blind wrath, driving out fear, arose in her heart:\r\nit seemed to choke her, and she felt the blood-vessels in her temples\r\nswell and throb. Wounded vanity can make a woman more vindictive than a\r\nlioness robbed of her cubs. Kitty\'s jaw, always a little too square,\r\nprotruded with an apish hideousness and her beautiful eyes were black\r\nwith malice. But she kept her temper in check.\r\n\r\n"If a man hasn\'t what\'s necessary to make a woman love him, it\'s his\r\nfault, not hers."\r\n\r\n"Evidently."\r\n\r\nHis derisive tone increased her irritation. She felt that she could\r\nwound him more by maintaining her calm.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not very well educated and I\'m not very clever. I\'m just a\r\nperfectly ordinary young woman. I like the things that the people like\r\namong whom I\'ve lived all my life. I like dancing and tennis and\r\ntheatres and I like the men who play games. It\'s quite true that I\'ve\r\nalways been bored by you and by the things you like. They mean nothing\r\nto me and I don\'t want them to. You dragged me round those interminable\r\ngalleries in Venice: I should have enjoyed myself much more playing golf\r\nat Sandwich."\r\n\r\n"I know."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry if I haven\'t been all that you expected me to be.\r\nUnfortunately I always found you physically repulsive. You can hardly\r\nblame me for that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t."\r\n\r\nKitty could more easily have coped with the situation if he had raved\r\nand stormed. She could have met violence with violence. His self-control\r\nwas inhuman and she hated him now as she had never hated him before.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'re a man at all. Why didn\'t you break into the room\r\nwhen you knew I was there with Charlie? You might at least have tried to\r\nthrash him. Were you afraid?"\r\n\r\nBut the moment she had said this she flushed, for she was ashamed. He\r\ndid not answer, but in his eyes she read an icy disdain. The shadow of a\r\nsmile flickered on his lips.\r\n\r\n"It may be that, like a historical character, I am too proud to fight."\r\n\r\nKitty, unable to think of anything to answer, shrugged her shoulders.\r\nFor a moment longer he held her in his immobile gaze.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ve said all I had to say: if you refuse to come to Mei-tan-fu\r\nI shall file my petition."\r\n\r\n"Why won\'t you consent to let me divorce you?"\r\n\r\nHe took his eyes off her at last. He leaned back in his chair and lit a\r\ncigarette. He smoked it to the end without saying a word. Then, throwing\r\naway the butt, he gave a little smile. He looked at her once more.\r\n\r\n"If Mrs. Townsend will give me her assurance that she will divorce her\r\nhusband and if he will give me his written promise to marry you within a\r\nweek of the two decrees being made absolute, I will do that."\r\n\r\nThere was something in the way he spoke which disconcerted her. But her\r\nself-respect obliged her to accept his offer in the grand manner.\r\n\r\n"That is very generous of you, Walter."\r\n\r\nTo her astonishment he burst suddenly into a shout of laughter. She\r\nflushed angrily.\r\n\r\n"What are you laughing at? I see nothing to laugh at."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon. I daresay my sense of humour is peculiar."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, frowning. She would have liked to say something\r\nbitter and wounding, but no rejoinder occurred to her. He looked at his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n"You had better look sharp if you want to catch Townsend at his office.\r\nIf you decide to come with me to Mei-tan-fu it would be necessary to\r\nstart the day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to tell him to-day?"\r\n\r\n"They say there is no time like the present."\r\n\r\nHer heart began to beat a little faster. It was not uneasiness that she\r\nfelt, it was, she didn\'t quite know what it was. She wished she could\r\nhave had a little longer; she would have liked to prepare Charlie. But\r\nshe had the fullest confidence in him, he loved her as much as she loved\r\nhim, and it was treacherous even to let the thought cross her mind that\r\nhe would not welcome the necessity that was forced upon them. She turned\r\nto Walter gravely.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you know what love is. You can have no conception how\r\ndesperately in love Charlie and I are with one another. It really is the\r\nonly thing that matters and every sacrifice that our love calls for will\r\nbe as easy as falling off a log."\r\n\r\nHe gave a little bow, but said nothing, and his eyes followed her as she\r\nwalked with measured step from the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxiv_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sent in a little note to Charlie on which she had written: "_Please\r\nsee me. It is urgent._" A Chinese boy asked her to wait and brought the\r\nanswer that Mr. Townsend would see her in five minutes. She was\r\nunaccountably nervous. When at last she was ushered into his room\r\nCharlie came forward to shake hands with her, but the moment the boy,\r\nhaving closed the door, left them alone he dropped the affable formality\r\nof his manner.\r\n\r\n"I say, my dear, you really mustn\'t come here in working hours. I\'ve got\r\nan awful lot to do and we don\'t want to give people a chance to gossip."\r\n\r\nShe gave him a long look with those beautiful eyes of hers and tried to\r\nsmile, but her lips were stiff and she could not.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have come unless it was necessary."\r\n\r\nHe smiled and took her arm.\r\n\r\n"Well, since you\'re here come and sit down."\r\n\r\nIt was a long bare room, narrow, with a high ceiling; its walls were\r\npainted in two shades of terra cotta. The only furniture consisted of a\r\nlarge desk, a revolving chair for Townsend to sit in and a leather\r\narm-chair for visitors. It intimidated Kitty to sit in this. He sat at\r\nthe desk. She had never seen him in spectacles before; she did not know\r\nthat he used them. When he noticed that her eyes were on them he took\r\nthem off.\r\n\r\n"I only use them for reading," he said.\r\n\r\nHer tears came easily and now, she hardly knew why, she began to cry.\r\nShe had no deliberate intention of deceiving, but rather an instinctive\r\ndesire to excite his sympathy. He looked at her blankly.\r\n\r\n"Is anything the matter? Oh, my dear, don\'t cry."\r\n\r\nShe took out her handkerchief and tried to check her sobs. He rang the\r\nbell and when the boy came to the door went to it.\r\n\r\n"If anyone asks for me say I\'m out."\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir."\r\n\r\nThe boy closed the door. Charlie sat on the arm of the chair and put his\r\narm round Kitty\'s shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Now, Kitty dear, tell me all about it."\r\n\r\n"Walter wants a divorce," she said.\r\n\r\nShe felt the pressure of his arm on her shoulder cease. His body\r\nstiffened. There was a moment\'s silence, then Townsend rose from her\r\nchair and sat down once more in his.\r\n\r\n"What exactly do you mean?" he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly, for his voice was hoarse, and she saw that\r\nhis face was dully red.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had a talk with him. I\'ve come straight from the house now. He\r\nsays he has all the proof he wants."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t commit yourself, did you? You didn\'t acknowledge anything?"\r\n\r\nHer heart sank.\r\n\r\n"No," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure?" he asked, looking at her sharply.\r\n\r\n"Quite sure," she lied again.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair and stared vacantly at the map of China\r\nwhich was hanging on the wall in front of him. She watched him\r\nanxiously. She was somewhat disconcerted at the manner in which he had\r\nreceived the news. She had expected him to take her in his arms and tell\r\nher he was thankful, for now they could be together always; but of\r\ncourse men were funny. She was crying softly, not now to arouse\r\nsympathy, but because it seemed the natural thing to do.\r\n\r\n"This is a bloody mess we\'ve got into," he said at length. "But it\'s no\r\ngood losing our heads. Crying isn\'t going to do us any good, you know."\r\n\r\nShe noticed the irritation in his voice and dried her eyes.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not my fault, Charlie. I couldn\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"Of course you couldn\'t. It was just damned bad luck. I was just as much\r\nto blame as you were. The thing to do now is to see how we\'re going to\r\nget out of it. I don\'t suppose you want to be divorced any more than I\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nShe smothered a gasp. She gave him a searching look. He was not thinking\r\nof her at all.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what his proofs really are. I don\'t know how he can actually\r\nprove that we were together in that room. On the whole we\'ve been about\r\nas careful as anyone could be. I\'m sure that old fellow at the curio\r\nshop wouldn\'t have given us away. Even if he\'d seen us go in there\'s no\r\nreason why we shouldn\'t hunt curios together."\r\n\r\nHe was talking to himself rather than to her.\r\n\r\n"It\'s easy enough to bring charges, but it\'s damned difficult to prove\r\nthem; any lawyer will tell you that. Our line is to deny everything, and\r\nif he threatens to bring an action we\'ll tell him to go to hell and\r\nwe\'ll fight it."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t go into court, Charlie."\r\n\r\n"Why on earth not? I\'m afraid you\'ll have to. God knows, I don\'t want a\r\nrow, but we can\'t take it lying down."\r\n\r\n"Why need we defend it?"\r\n\r\n"What a question to ask! After all, it\'s not only you that are\r\nconcerned, I\'m concerned too. But as a matter of fact I don\'t think you\r\nneed be afraid of that. We shall be able to square your husband somehow.\r\nThe only thing that worries me is the best way to set about it."\r\n\r\nIt looked as though an idea occurred to him, for he turned towards her\r\nwith his charming smile and his tone, a moment before abrupt and\r\nbusiness-like, became ingratiating.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'ve been awfully upset, poor little woman. It\'s too bad."\r\nHe stretched out his hand and took hers. "It\'s a scrape we\'ve got into,\r\nbut we shall get out of it. It\'s not . . ." He stopped and Kitty had a\r\nsuspicion that he had been about to say that it was not the first he had\r\ngot out of. "The great thing is to keep our heads. You know I shall\r\nnever let you down."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not frightened. I don\'t care what he does."\r\n\r\nHe smiled still, but perhaps his smile was a trifle forced.\r\n\r\n"If the worst comes to the worst I shall have to tell the Governor.\r\nHe\'ll curse me like hell, but he\'s a good fellow and a man of the world.\r\nHe\'ll fix it up somehow. It wouldn\'t do him any good if there was a\r\nscandal."\r\n\r\n"What can he do?" asked Kitty.\r\n\r\n"He can bring pressure to bear on Walter. If he can\'t get at him through\r\nhis ambition he\'ll get at him through his sense of duty."\r\n\r\nKitty was a little chilled. She did not seem able to make Charlie see\r\nhow desperately grave the situation was. His airiness made her\r\nimpatient. She was sorry that she had come to see him in his office. The\r\nsurroundings intimidated her. It would have been much easier to say what\r\nshe wanted if she could have been in his arms with hers round his neck.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know Walter," she said.\r\n\r\n"I know that every man has his price."\r\n\r\nShe loved Charlie with all her heart, but his reply disconcerted her;\r\nfor such a clever man it was a stupid thing to say.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you realise how angry Walter is. You haven\'t seen his\r\nface and the look of his eyes."\r\n\r\nHe did not reply for a moment, but looked at her with a slight smile.\r\nShe knew what he was thinking. Walter was the bacteriologist and\r\noccupied a subordinate position; he would hardly have the impudence to\r\nmake himself a nuisance to the upper officials of the Colony.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good deceiving yourself, Charlie," she said earnestly. "If\r\nWalter has made up his mind to bring an action nothing that you or\r\nanybody else can say will have the slightest influence."\r\n\r\nHis face once more grew heavy and sulky.\r\n\r\n"Is it his idea to make me co-respondent?"\r\n\r\n"At first it was. At last I managed to get him to consent to let me\r\ndivorce him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, that\'s not so terrible." His manner relaxed again and she saw\r\nthe relief in his eyes. "That seems to me a very good way out. After\r\nall, it\'s the least a man can do, it\'s the only decent thing."\r\n\r\n"But he makes a condition."\r\n\r\nHe gave her an inquiring glance and he seemed to reflect.\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m not a very rich man, but I\'ll do anything in my power."\r\n\r\nKitty was silent. Charlie was saying things which she would never have\r\nexpected him to say. And they made it difficult for her to speak. She\r\nhad expected to blurt it out in one breath, held in his loving arms,\r\nwith her burning face hid on his breast.\r\n\r\n"He agrees to my divorcing him if your wife will give him the assurance\r\nthat she will divorce you."\r\n\r\n"Anything else?"\r\n\r\nKitty could hardly find her voice.\r\n\r\n"And--it\'s awfully hard to say, Charlie, it sounds dreadful--if you\'ll\r\npromise to marry me within a week of the decrees being made absolute."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxv_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was silent. Then he took her hand again and pressed it\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n"You know, darling," he said, "whatever happens we must keep Dorothy out\r\nof this."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him blankly.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t understand. How can we?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we can\'t only think of ourselves in this world. You know, other\r\nthings being equal, there\'s nothing in the world I\'d love more than to\r\nmarry you. But it\'s quite out of the question. I know Dorothy: nothing\r\nwould induce her to divorce me."\r\n\r\nKitty was becoming horribly frightened. She began to cry again. He got\r\nup and sat down beside her with his arm round her waist.\r\n\r\n"Try not to upset yourself, darling. We _must_ keep our heads."\r\n\r\n"I thought you loved me . . ."\r\n\r\n"Of course I love you," he said tenderly. "You surely can\'t have any\r\ndoubt of that now."\r\n\r\n"If she won\'t divorce you Walter will make you co-respondent."\r\n\r\nHe took an appreciable time to answer. His tone was dry.\r\n\r\n"Of course that would ruin my career, but I\'m afraid it wouldn\'t do you\r\nmuch good. If the worst came to the worst I should make a clean breast\r\nof it to Dorothy; she\'d be dreadfully hurt and wretched, but she\'d\r\nforgive me." He had an idea. "I\'m not sure if the best plan wouldn\'t be\r\nto make a clean breast of it anyhow. If she went to your husband I\r\ndaresay she could persuade him to hold his tongue."\r\n\r\n"Does that mean you don\'t want her to divorce you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I have got my boys to think of, haven\'t I? And naturally I don\'t\r\nwant to make her unhappy. We\'ve always got on very well together. She\'s\r\nbeen an awfully good wife to me, you know."\r\n\r\n"Why did you tell me that she meant nothing to you?"\r\n\r\n"I never did. I said I wasn\'t in love with her. We haven\'t slept\r\ntogether for years except now and then, on Christmas Day for instance,\r\nor the day before she was going home or the day she came back. She isn\'t\r\na woman who cares for that sort of thing. But we\'ve always been\r\nexcellent friends. I don\'t mind telling you that I depend on her more\r\nthan anyone has any idea of."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think it would have been better to leave me alone then?"\r\n\r\nShe found it strange that with terror catching her breath she could\r\nspeak so calmly.\r\n\r\n"You were the loveliest little thing I\'d seen for years. I just fell\r\nmadly in love with you. You can\'t blame me for that."\r\n\r\n"After all, you said you\'d never let me down."\r\n\r\n"But, good God, I\'m not going to let you down. We\'ve got in an awful\r\nscrape and I\'m going to do everything that\'s humanly possible to get you\r\nout of it."\r\n\r\n"Except the one obvious and natural thing."\r\n\r\nHe stood up and returned to his own chair.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you must be reasonable. We\'d much better face the situation\r\nfrankly. I don\'t want to hurt your feelings, but really I must tell you\r\nthe truth. I\'m very keen on my career. There\'s no reason why I shouldn\'t\r\nbe a Governor one of these days, and it\'s a damned soft job to be a\r\nColonial Governor. Unless we can hush this up I don\'t stand a dog\'s\r\nchance. I may not have to leave the service, but there\'ll always be a\r\nblack mark against me. If I do have to leave the service then I must go\r\ninto business in China, where I know people. In either case my only\r\nchance is for Dorothy to stick to me."\r\n\r\n"Was it necessary to tell me that you wanted nothing in the world but\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nThe corners of his mouth drooped peevishly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, it\'s rather hard to take quite literally the things a man\r\nsays when he\'s in love with you."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you mean them?"\r\n\r\n"At the moment."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s to happen to me if Walter divorces me?"\r\n\r\n"If we really haven\'t a leg to stand on of course we won\'t defend. There\r\nshouldn\'t be any publicity and people are pretty broad-minded nowadays."\r\n\r\nFor the first time Kitty thought of her mother. She shivered. She looked\r\nagain at Townsend. Her pain now was tinged with resentment.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you\'d have no difficulty in bearing any inconvenience that I\r\nhad to suffer," she said.\r\n\r\n"We\'re not going to get much further by saying disagreeable things to\r\none another," he answered.\r\n\r\nShe gave a cry of despair. It was dreadful that she should love him so\r\ndevotedly and yet feel such bitterness towards him. It was not possible\r\nthat he understood how much he meant to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Charlie, don\'t you know how I love you?"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, I love you. Only we\'re not living in a desert island and\r\nwe\'ve got to make the best we can out of the circumstances that are\r\nforced upon us. You really must be reasonable."\r\n\r\n"How can I be reasonable? To me our love was everything and you were my\r\nwhole life. It is not very pleasant to realise that to you it was only\r\nan episode."\r\n\r\n"Of course it wasn\'t an episode. But you know, when you ask me to get my\r\nwife, to whom I\'m very much attached, to divorce me, and ruin my career\r\nby marrying you, you\'re asking a good deal."\r\n\r\n"No more than I\'m willing to do for you."\r\n\r\n"The circumstances are rather different."\r\n\r\n"The only difference is that you don\'t love me."\r\n\r\n"One can be very much in love with a woman without wishing to spend the\r\nrest of one\'s life with her."\r\n\r\nShe gave him a quick look and despair seized her. Heavy tears rolled\r\ndown her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how cruel! How can you be so heartless?"\r\n\r\nShe began to sob hysterically. He gave an anxious glance at the door.\r\n\r\n"My dear, do try and control yourself."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know how I love you," she gasped. "I can\'t live without you.\r\nHave you no pity for me?"\r\n\r\nShe could not speak any more. She wept without restraint.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to be unkind and, Heaven knows, I don\'t want to hurt your\r\nfeelings, but I must tell you the truth."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the ruin of my whole life. Why couldn\'t you leave me alone? What\r\nharm had I ever done you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course if it does you any good to put all the blame on me you may."\r\n\r\nKitty blazed with sudden anger.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I threw myself at your head. I suppose I gave you no peace\r\ntill you yielded to my entreaties."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that. But I certainly should never have thought of making\r\nlove to you if you hadn\'t made it perfectly clear that you were ready to\r\nbe made love to."\r\n\r\nOh, the shame of it! She knew that what he said was true. His face now\r\nwas sullen and worried and his hands moved uneasily. Every now and then\r\nhe gave her a little glance of exasperation.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t your husband forgive you?" he said after a while.\r\n\r\n"I never asked him."\r\n\r\nInstinctively he clenched his hands. She saw him suppress the\r\nexclamation of annoyance which came to his lips.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you go to him and throw yourself on his mercy? If he\'s as\r\nmuch in love with you as you say he\'s bound to forgive you."\r\n\r\n"How little you know him!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxvi_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe wiped her eyes. She tried to pull herself together.\r\n\r\n"Charlie, if you desert me I shall die."\r\n\r\nShe was driven now to appeal to his compassion. She ought to have told\r\nhim at once. When he knew the horrible alternative that was placed\r\nbefore her his generosity, his sense of justice, his manliness, would be\r\nso vehemently aroused that he would think of nothing but her danger. Oh,\r\nhow passionately she desired to feel his dear, protecting arms around\r\nher!\r\n\r\n"Walter wants me to go to Mei-tan-fu."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but that\'s the place where the cholera is. They\'ve got the worst\r\nepidemic that they\'ve had for fifty years. It\'s no place for a woman.\r\nYou can\'t possibly go there."\r\n\r\n"If you let me down I shall have to."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"Walter is taking the place of the missionary doctor who died. He wants\r\nme to go with him."\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"Now. At once."\r\n\r\nTownsend pushed back his chair and looked at her with puzzled eyes.\r\n\r\n"I may be very stupid, but I can\'t make head or tail out of what you\'re\r\nsaying. If he wants you to go to this place with him, what about a\r\ndivorce?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s given me my choice. I must either go to Mei-tan-fu or else he\'ll\r\nbring an action."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see." Townsend\'s tone changed ever so slightly. "I think that\'s\r\nrather decent of him, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Decent?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a damned sporting thing of him to go there. It\'s not a thing\r\nI\'d fancy. Of course he\'ll get a C.M.G. for it when he comes back."\r\n\r\n"But me, Charlie?" she cried, with anguish in her voice.\r\n\r\n"Well, I think if he wants you to go, under the circumstances I don\'t\r\nsee how you can very well refuse."\r\n\r\n"It means death. Absolutely certain death."\r\n\r\n"Oh, damn it all, that\'s rather an exaggeration. He would hardly take\r\nyou if he thought that. It\'s no more risk for you than for him. In point\r\nof fact there\'s no great risk if you\'re careful. I\'ve been here when\r\nthere\'s been cholera and I haven\'t turned a hair. The great thing is not\r\nto eat anything uncooked, no raw fruit or salads, or anything like that,\r\nand see that your drinking water is boiled." He was gaining confidence\r\nas he proceeded, and his speech was fluent; he was even becoming less\r\nsullen and more alert; he was almost breezy. "After all, it\'s his job,\r\nisn\'t it? He\'s interested in bugs. It\'s rather a chance for him if you\r\ncome to think of it."\r\n\r\n"But me, Charlie?" she repeated, not with anguish now, but with\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n"Well, the best way to understand a man is to put yourself in his shoes.\r\nFrom his point of view you\'ve been rather a naughty little thing and he\r\nwants to get you out of harm\'s way. I always thought he never wanted to\r\ndivorce you, he doesn\'t strike me as that sort of chap; but he made what\r\nhe thought was a very generous offer and you put his back up by turning\r\nit down. I don\'t want to blame you, but really for all our sakes I think\r\nyou ought to have given it a little consideration."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you see it\'ll kill me? Don\'t you know that he\'s taking me\r\nthere because he _knows_ it\'ll kill me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, don\'t talk like that. We\'re in a damned awkward position\r\nand really it\'s no time to be melodramatic."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve made up your mind not to understand." Oh, the pain in her heart,\r\nand the fear! She could have screamed. "You can\'t send me to certain\r\ndeath. If you have no love or pity for me you must have just ordinary\r\nhuman feeling."\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s rather hard on me to put it like that. As far as I can\r\nmake out your husband is behaving very generously. He\'s willing to\r\nforgive you if you\'ll let him. He wants to get you away and this\r\nopportunity has presented itself to take you to some place where for a\r\nfew months you\'ll be out of harm\'s way. I don\'t pretend that Mei-tan-fu\r\nis a health resort, I never knew a Chinese city that was, but there\'s no\r\nreason to get the wind up about it. In fact that\'s the worst thing you\r\ncan do. I believe as many people die from sheer fright in an epidemic as\r\nbecause they get infected."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m frightened now. When Walter spoke of it I almost fainted."\r\n\r\n"At the first moment I can quite believe it was a shock, but when you\r\ncome to look at it calmly you\'ll be all right. It\'ll be the sort of\r\nexperience that not everyone has had."\r\n\r\n"I thought, I thought . . ."\r\n\r\nShe rocked to and fro in an agony. He did not speak, and once more his\r\nface wore that sullen look which till lately she had never known. Kitty\r\nwas not crying now. She was dry-eyed, calm, and though her voice was low\r\nit was steady.\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to go?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Hobson\'s choice, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s only fair to you to tell you that if your husband brought an\r\naction for divorce and won it I should not be in a position to marry\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nIt must have seemed an age to him before she answered. She rose slowly\r\nto her feet.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that my husband ever thought of bringing an action."\r\n\r\n"Then why in God\'s name have you been frightening me out of my wits?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him coolly.\r\n\r\n"He knew that you\'d let me down."\r\n\r\nShe was silent. Vaguely, as when you are studying a foreign language and\r\nread a page which at first you can make nothing of, till a word or a\r\nsentence gives you a clue; and on a sudden a suspicion, as it were, of\r\nthe sense flashes across your troubled wits, vaguely she gained an\r\ninkling into the workings of Walter\'s mind. It was like a dark and\r\nominous landscape seen by a flash of lightning and in a moment hidden\r\nagain by the night. She shuddered at what she saw.\r\n\r\n"He made that threat only because he knew that you\'d crumple up at it,\r\nCharlie. It\'s strange that he should have judged you so accurately. It\r\nwas just like him to expose me to such a cruel disillusion."\r\n\r\nCharlie looked down at the sheet of blotting paper in front of him. He\r\nwas frowning a little and his mouth was sulky. But he did not reply.\r\n\r\n"He knew that you were vain, cowardly and self-seeking. He wanted me to\r\nsee it with my own eyes. He knew that you\'d run like a hare at the\r\napproach of danger. He knew how grossly deceived I was in thinking that\r\nyou were in love with me, because he knew that you were incapable of\r\nloving anyone but yourself. He knew you\'d sacrifice me without a pang to\r\nsave your own skin."\r\n\r\n"If it really gives you any satisfaction to say beastly things to me I\r\nsuppose I\'ve got no right to complain. Women always are unfair and they\r\ngenerally manage to put a man in the wrong. But there is something to be\r\nsaid on the other side."\r\n\r\nShe took no notice of his interruption.\r\n\r\n"And now I know all that he knew. I know that you\'re callous and\r\nheartless. I know that you\'re selfish, selfish beyond words, and I know\r\nthat you haven\'t the nerve of a rabbit, I know you\'re a liar and a\r\nhumbug, I know that you\'re utterly contemptible. And the tragic part\r\nis"--her face was on a sudden distraught with pain--"the tragic part is\r\nthat notwithstanding I love you with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"Kitty."\r\n\r\nShe gave a bitter laugh. He had spoken her name in that melting, rich\r\ntone of his which came to him so naturally and meant so little.\r\n\r\n"You fool," she said.\r\n\r\nHe drew back quickly, flushing and offended; he could not make her out.\r\nShe gave him a look in which there was a glint of amusement.\r\n\r\n"You\'re beginning to dislike me, aren\'t you? Well, dislike me. It\r\ndoesn\'t make any difference to me now."\r\n\r\nShe began to put on her gloves.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be afraid, you\'ll come to no harm. You\'ll be quite safe."\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake, don\'t talk like that, Kitty," he answered and his deep\r\nvoice rang with anxiety. "You must know that everything that concerns\r\nyou concerns me. I shall be frightfully anxious to know what happens.\r\nWhat are you going to say to your husband?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to tell him that I\'m prepared to go to Mei-tan-fu with him."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps when you consent he won\'t insist."\r\n\r\nHe could not have known why, when he said this, she looked at him so\r\nstrangely.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not really frightened?" he asked her.\r\n\r\n"No," she said. "You\'ve inspired me with courage. To go into the midst\r\nof a cholera epidemic will be a unique experience and if I die of\r\nit--well, I die."\r\n\r\n"I was trying to be as kind to you as I could."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again. Tears sprang into her eyes once more and her\r\nheart was very full. The impulse was almost irresistible to fling\r\nherself on his breast and crush her lips against his. It was no use.\r\n\r\n"If you want to know," she said, trying to keep her voice steady, "I go\r\nwith death in my heart and fear. I do not know what Walter has in that\r\ndark, twisted mind of his, but I\'m shaking with terror. I think it may\r\nbe that death will be really a release."\r\n\r\nShe felt that she could not hold on to her self control for another\r\nmoment. She walked swiftly to the door and let herself out before he had\r\ntime to move from his chair. Townsend gave a long sigh of relief. He\r\nbadly wanted a brandy and soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxvii_\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter was in when she got home. She would have liked to go straight to\r\nher room, but he was downstairs, in the hall, giving instructions to one\r\nof the boys. She was so wretched that she welcomed the humiliation to\r\nwhich she must expose herself. She stopped and faced him.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming with you to that place," she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, good."\r\n\r\n"When do you want me to be ready?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow night."\r\n\r\nShe did not know what spirit of bravado entered into her. His\r\nindifference was like the prick of a spear. She said a thing that\r\nsurprised herself.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I needn\'t take more than a few summer things and a shroud,\r\nneed I?"\r\n\r\nShe was watching his face and knew that her flippancy angered him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve already told your amah what you\'ll want."\r\n\r\nShe nodded and went up to her room. She was very pale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxviii_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were reaching their destination at last. They were borne in chairs,\r\nday after day, along a narrow causeway between interminable rice-fields.\r\nThey set out at dawn and travelled till the heat of the day forced them\r\nto take shelter in a wayside inn and then went on again till they\r\nreached the town where they had arranged to spend the night. Kitty\'s\r\nchair headed the procession and Walter followed her; then in a\r\nstraggling line came the coolies that bore their bedding, stores and\r\nequipment. Kitty passed through the country with unseeing eyes. All\r\nthrough the long hours, the silence broken only by an occasional remark\r\nfrom one of the bearers or a snatch of uncouth song, she turned over in\r\nher tortured mind the details of that heart-rending scene in Charlie\'s\r\noffice. Recalling what he had said to her and what she had said to him,\r\nshe was dismayed to see what an arid and business-like turn their\r\nconversation had taken. She had not said what she wanted to say and she\r\nhad not spoken in the tone she intended. Had she been able to make him\r\nsee her boundless love, the passion in her heart, and her helplessness,\r\nhe could never have been so inhuman as to leave her to her fate. She had\r\nbeen taken unawares. She could hardly believe her ears when he told her,\r\nmore clearly than with words, that he cared nothing for her. That was\r\nwhy she had not even cried very much, she had been so dazed. She had\r\nwept since, wept miserably.\r\n\r\nAt night in the inns, sharing the principal guest chamber with her\r\nhusband and conscious that Walter, lying on his camp bed, a few feet\r\naway from her, lay awake, she dug her teeth in the pillow so that no\r\nsound might escape her. But in the daytime, protected by the curtains of\r\nher chair, she allowed herself to give way. Her pain was so great that\r\nshe could have screamed at the top of her voice; she had never known\r\nthat one could suffer so much; and she asked herself desperately what\r\nshe had done to deserve it. She could not make out why Charlie did not\r\nlove her: it was her fault, she supposed, but she had done everything\r\nshe knew to make him fond of her. They had always got on so well, they\r\nlaughed all the time they were together, they were not only lovers but\r\ngood friends. She could not understand; she was broken. She told herself\r\nthat she hated and despised him; but she had no idea how she was going\r\nto live if she was never to see him again. If Walter was taking her to\r\nMei-tan-fu as a punishment he was making a fool of himself, for what did\r\nshe care now what became of her? She had nothing to live for any more.\r\nIt was rather hard to be finished with life at twenty-seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxix_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the steamer that took them up the Western River Walter read\r\nincessantly, but at meal-times he endeavoured to make some kind of\r\nconversation. He talked to her as though she were a stranger with whom\r\nhe happened to be making the journey, of indifferent things, from\r\npoliteness, Kitty imagined, or because so he could render more marked\r\nthe gulf that separated them.\r\n\r\nIn a flash of insight she had told Charlie that Walter had sent her to\r\nhim with the threat of divorce as the alternative to her accompanying\r\nhim to the stricken city in order that she might see for herself how\r\nindifferent, cowardly and selfish he was. It was true. It was a trick\r\nwhich accorded very well with his sardonic humour. He knew exactly what\r\nwould happen and he had given her amah necessary instructions before her\r\nreturn. She had caught in his eyes a disdain which seemed to include her\r\nlover as well as herself. He said to himself, perhaps, that if he had\r\nbeen in Townsend\'s place nothing in the world would have hindered him\r\nfrom making any sacrifice to gratify her smallest whim. She knew that\r\nwas true also. But then, when her eyes were opened, how could he make\r\nher do something which was so dangerous, and which he must know\r\nfrightened her so terribly? At first she thought he was only playing\r\nwith her and till they actually started, no, later, till they left the\r\nriver and took to the chairs for the journey across country, she thought\r\nhe would give that little laugh of his and tell her that she need not\r\ncome. She had no inkling what was in his mind. He could not really\r\ndesire her death. He had loved her so desperately. She knew what love\r\nwas now and she remembered a thousand signs of his adoration. For him\r\nreally, in the French phrase, she did make fine weather and foul. It was\r\nimpossible that he did not love her still. Did you cease to love a\r\nperson because you had been treated cruelly? She had not made him suffer\r\nas Charlie had made her suffer and yet, if Charlie made a sign,\r\nnotwithstanding everything, even though she knew him now, she would\r\nabandon all the world had to offer and fly to his arms. Even though he\r\nhad sacrificed her and cared nothing for her, even though he was callous\r\nand unkind, she loved him.\r\n\r\nAt first she thought that she had only to bide her time, and sooner or\r\nlater Walter would forgive her. She had been too confident of her power\r\nover him to believe that it was gone for ever. Many waters could not\r\nquench love. He was weak if he loved her, and she felt that love her he\r\nmust. But now she was not quite sure. When in the evening he sat reading\r\nin the straight-backed blackwood chair of the inn with the light of a\r\nhurricane lamp on his face she was able to watch him at her ease. She\r\nlay on the pallet on which her bed presently would be set and she was in\r\nshadow. Those straight, regular features of his made his face look very\r\nsevere. You could hardly believe that it was possible for them on\r\noccasion to be changed by so sweet a smile. He was able to read as\r\ncalmly as though she were a thousand miles away; she saw him turn the\r\npages and she saw his eyes move regularly as they travelled from line to\r\nline. He was not thinking of her. And when, the table being set and\r\ndinner brought in, he put aside his book and gave her a glance (not\r\nknowing how the light on his face threw into distinctness his\r\nexpression), she was startled to see in his eyes a look of physical\r\ndistaste. Yes, it startled her. Was it possible that his love had left\r\nhim entirely? Was it possible that he really designed her death? It was\r\nabsurd. That would be the act of a madman. It was odd, the little shiver\r\nthat ran through her as the thought occurred to her that perhaps Walter\r\nwas not quite sane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxx_\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly her bearers, long silent, began to speak and one of them,\r\nturning round, with words she could not understand and with a gesture,\r\nsought to attract her attention. She looked in the direction he pointed\r\nand there, on the top of a hill, saw an archway; she knew by now that it\r\nwas a memorial in compliment of a fortunate scholar or a virtuous widow,\r\nshe had passed many of them since they left the river; but this one,\r\nsilhouetted against the westering sun, was more fantastic and beautiful\r\nthan any she had seen. Yet, she knew not why, it made her uneasy; it had\r\na significance which she felt but could not put into words: Was it a\r\nmenace that she vaguely discerned or was it derision? She was passing a\r\ngrove of bamboos and they leaned over the causeway strangely as if they\r\nwould detain her; though the summer evening was windless their narrow\r\ngreen leaves shivered a little. It gave her the sensation that someone\r\nhidden among them was watching her as she passed. Now they came to the\r\nfoot of the hill and the rice-fields ceased. The bearers took it with a\r\nswinging stride. The hill was covered close with little green mounds,\r\nclose, close to one another, so that the ground was ribbed like the\r\nsea-sand when the tide has gone out; and this she knew too, for she had\r\npassed just such a spot as they approached each populous city and left\r\nit. It was the graveyard. Now she knew why the bearers had called her\r\nattention to the archway that stood on the crest of the hill: they had\r\nreached the end of their journey.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the archway and the chair-bearers paused to change\r\nthe pole from shoulder to shoulder. One of them wiped his sweating face\r\nwith a dirty rag. The causeway wound down. There were bedraggled houses\r\non each side. Now the night was falling. But the bearers on a sudden\r\nbroke into excited talk and with a jump that shook her ranged themselves\r\nas near as they could to the wall. In a moment she knew what had\r\nstartled them, for as they stood there, chattering to one another, four\r\npeasants passed, quick and silent, bearing a new coffin, unpainted, and\r\nits fresh wood gleamed white in the approaching darkness. Kitty felt her\r\nheart beat in terror against her ribs. The coffin passed, but the\r\nbearers stood still; it seemed as though they could not summon up the\r\nwill to go on. But there was a shout from behind and they started. They\r\ndid not speak now.\r\n\r\nThey walked for a few minutes longer and then turned sharply into an\r\nopen gateway. The chair was set down. She had arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxi_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a bungalow and she entered the sitting-room. She sat down while\r\nthe coolies, straggling in one by one, brought in their loads. Walter in\r\nthe courtyard gave directions where this or that was to be placed. She\r\nwas very tired. She was startled to hear an unknown voice.\r\n\r\n"May I come in?"\r\n\r\nShe flushed and grew pale. She was overwrought and it made her nervous\r\nto meet a stranger. A man came out of the darkness, for the long low\r\nroom was lit only by a shaded lamp, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n"My name is Waddington. I am the Deputy Commissioner."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the Customs. I know. I heard that you were here."\r\n\r\nIn that dim light she could see only that he was a little thin man, no\r\ntaller than she, with a bald head and a small, bare face.\r\n\r\n"I live just at the bottom of the hill, but coming in this way you\r\nwouldn\'t have seen my house. I thought you\'d be too fagged to come and\r\ndine with me, so I\'ve ordered your dinner here and I\'ve invited myself."\r\n\r\n"I\'m delighted to hear it."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find the cook\'s not bad. I kept on Watson\'s boys for you."\r\n\r\n"Watson was the missionary who was here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Very nice fellow. I\'ll show you his grave to-morrow if you like."\r\n\r\n"How kind you are," said Kitty, with a smile.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Walter came in. Waddington had introduced himself to him\r\nbefore coming in to see Kitty and now he said:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just been breaking it to your missus that I\'m dining with you.\r\nSince Watson died I haven\'t had anybody much to talk to but the nuns,\r\nand I can never do myself justice in French. Besides, there is only a\r\nlimited number of subjects you can talk to them about."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just told the boy to bring in some drinks," said Walter.\r\n\r\nThe servant brought whisky and soda and Kitty noticed that Waddington\r\nhelped himself generously. His manner of speaking and his easy chuckle\r\nhad suggested to her when he came in that he was not quite sober.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s luck," he said. Then, turning to Walter: "You\'ve got your work\r\ncut out for you here. They\'re dying like flies. The magistrate\'s lost\r\nhis head and Colonel Y\xc3\xbc, the officer commanding the troops, is having a\r\ndevil of a job to prevent them from looting. If something doesn\'t happen\r\nsoon we shall all be murdered in our beds. I tried to get the nuns to\r\ngo, but of course they wouldn\'t. They all want to be martyrs, damn\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nHe spoke lightly and there was in his voice a sort of ghostly laughter\r\nso that you could not listen to him without smiling.\r\n\r\n"Why haven\'t you gone?" asked Walter.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve lost half my staff and the others are ready to lie down and\r\ndie at any minute. Somebody\'s got to stay and keep things together."\r\n\r\n"Have you been inoculated?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Watson did me. But he did himself too, and it didn\'t do him much\r\ngood, poor blighter." He turned to Kitty and his funny little face was\r\ngaily puckered. "I don\'t think there\'s any great risk if you take proper\r\nprecautions. Have your milk and water boiled and don\'t eat fresh fruit\r\nor uncooked vegetables. Have you brought any gramophone records with\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think so," said Kitty.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry for that. I was hoping you would. I haven\'t had any for a\r\nlong time and I\'m sick of my old ones."\r\n\r\nThe boy came in to ask if they would have dinner.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t dress to-night, will you?" asked Waddington. "My boy died\r\nlast week and the boy I have now is a fool, so I haven\'t been dressing\r\nin the evening."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and take off my hat," said Kitty.\r\n\r\nHer room was next door to that in which they sat. It was barely\r\nfurnished. An amah was kneeling on the floor, the lamp beside her,\r\nunpacking Kitty\'s things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxii_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dining-room was small and the greater part of it was filled by an\r\nimmense table. On the walls were engravings of scenes from the Bible and\r\nilluminated texts.\r\n\r\n"Missionaries always have large dining-tables," Waddington explained.\r\n"They get so much a year more for every child they have and they buy\r\ntheir tables when they marry so that there shall be plenty of room for\r\nlittle strangers."\r\n\r\nFrom the ceiling hung a large paraffin lamp, so that Kitty was able to\r\nsee better what sort of a man Waddington was. His baldness had deceived\r\nher into thinking him no longer young, but she saw now that he must be\r\nwell under forty. His face, small under a high, rounded forehead, was\r\nunlined and fresh-coloured; it was ugly like a monkey\'s, but with an\r\nugliness that was not without charm; it was an amusing face. His\r\nfeatures, his nose and his mouth, were hardly larger than a child\'s, and\r\nhe had small, very bright blue eyes. His eyebrows were fair and scanty.\r\nHe looked like a funny little old boy. He helped himself constantly to\r\nliquor and as dinner proceeded it became evident that he was far from\r\nsober. But if he was drunk it was without offensiveness, gaily, as a\r\nsatyr might be who had stolen a wine-skin from a sleeping shepherd.\r\n\r\nHe talked of Tching-Yen; he had many friends there and he wanted to know\r\nabout them. He had been down for the races a year before and he talked\r\nof ponies and their owners.\r\n\r\n"By the way, what about Townsend?" he asked suddenly. "Is he going to\r\nbecome Colonial Secretary?"\r\n\r\nKitty felt herself flush, but her husband did not look at her.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder," he answered.\r\n\r\n"He\'s the sort that gets on."\r\n\r\n"Do you know him?" asked Walter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know him pretty well. We travelled out from home together once."\r\n\r\nFrom the other side of the river they heard the beating of gongs and the\r\nclatter of fire-crackers. There, so short a way from them, the great\r\ncity lay in terror; and death, sudden and ruthless, hurried through its\r\ntortuous streets. But Waddington began to speak of London. He talked of\r\nthe theatres. He knew everything that was being played at the moment and\r\nhe told them what pieces he had seen when he was last home on leave. He\r\nlaughed as he recollected the humour of this low comedian and sighed as\r\nhe reflected on the beauty of that star of musical comedy. He was\r\npleased to be able to boast that a cousin of his had married one of the\r\nmost celebrated. He had lunched with her and she had given him her\r\nphotograph. He would show it to them when they came and dined with him\r\nat the Customs.\r\n\r\nWalter looked at his guest with a cold and ironic gaze, but he was\r\nevidently not a little amused by him, and he made an effort to show a\r\ncivil interest in topics of which Kitty was well aware he knew nothing.\r\nA faint smile lingered on his lips. But Kitty, she knew not why, was\r\nfilled with awe. In the house of that dead missionary, over against the\r\nstricken city, they seemed immeasurably apart from all the world. Three\r\nsolitary creatures and strangers to each other.\r\n\r\nDinner was finished and she rose from the table.\r\n\r\n"Do you mind if I say good-night to you? I\'m going to bed."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take myself off, I expect the doctor wants to go to bed, too,"\r\nanswered Waddington. "We must be out early to-morrow."\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with Kitty. He was quite steady on his feet, but his eyes\r\nwere shining more than ever.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come and fetch you," he told Walter, "and take you to see the\r\nMagistrate and Colonel Y\xc3\xbc, and then we\'ll go along to the Convent.\r\nYou\'ve got your work cut out, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxiii_\r\n\r\n\r\nHer night was tortured with strange dreams. She seemed to be carried in\r\nher chair and she felt the swaying motion as the bearers marched with\r\ntheir long, uneven stride. She entered cities, vast and dim, where the\r\nmultitude thronged about her with curious eyes. The streets were narrow\r\nand tortuous and in the open shops, with their strange wares, all\r\ntraffic stopped as she went by and those who bought and those who sold,\r\npaused. Then she came to the memorial arch and its fantastic outline\r\nseemed on a sudden to gain a monstrous life; its capricious contours\r\nwere like the waving arms of a Hindu god, and, as she passed under it,\r\nshe heard the echo of mocking laughter. But then Charlie Townsend came\r\ntowards her and took her in his arms, lifting her out of the chair, and\r\nsaid it was all a mistake, he had never meant to treat her as he had,\r\nfor he loved her and he couldn\'t live without her. She felt his kisses\r\non her mouth and she wept with joy, asking him why he had been so cruel,\r\nbut though she asked she knew it did not matter. And then there was a\r\nhoarse, abrupt cry and they were separated and between, hurrying\r\nsilently, coolies passed in their ragged blue and they bore a coffin.\r\n\r\nShe awoke with a start.\r\n\r\nThe bungalow stood half way down a steep hill and from her window she\r\nsaw the narrow river below her and opposite, the city. The dawn had just\r\nbroken and from the river rose a white mist shrouding the junks that lay\r\nmoored close to one another like peas in a pod. There were hundreds of\r\nthem, and they were silent, mysterious in that ghostly light, and you\r\nhad a feeling that their crews lay under an enchantment, for it seemed\r\nthat it was not sleep, but something strange and terrible, that held\r\nthem so still and mute.\r\n\r\nThe morning drew on and the sun touched the mist so that it shone\r\nwhitely like the ghost of snow on a dying star. Though on the river it\r\nwas light so that you could discern palely the lines of the crowded\r\njunks and the thick forest of their masts, in front it was a shining\r\nwall the eye could not pierce. But suddenly from that white cloud a\r\ntall, grim and massive bastion emerged. It seemed not merely to be made\r\nvisible by the all-discovering sun but rather to rise out of nothing at\r\nthe touch of a magic wand. It towered, the stronghold of a cruel and\r\nbarbaric race, over the river. But the magician who built worked swiftly\r\nand now a fragment of coloured wall crowned the bastion; in a moment,\r\nout of the mist, looming vastly and touched here and there by a yellow\r\nray of sun, there was seen a cluster of green and yellow roofs. Huge\r\nthey seemed and you could make out no pattern; the order, if order there\r\nwas, escaped you; wayward and extravagant, but of an unimaginable\r\nrichness. This was no fortress, nor a temple, but the magic palace of\r\nsome emperor of the gods where no man might enter. It was too airy,\r\nfantastic and unsubstantial to be the work of human hands; it was the\r\nfabric of a dream.\r\n\r\nThe tears ran down Kitty\'s face and she gazed, her hands clasped to her\r\nbreast and her mouth, for she was breathless, open a little. She had\r\nnever felt so light of heart and it seemed to her as though her body\r\nwere a shell that lay at her feet and she pure spirit. Here was beauty.\r\nShe took it as the believer takes in his mouth the wafer which is God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxiv_\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Walter went out early in the morning, came back at tiffin only for\r\nhalf an hour, and did not then return till dinner was just ready, Kitty\r\nfound herself much alone. For some days she did not stir from the\r\nbungalow. It was very hot and for the most part she lay in a long chair\r\nby the open window, trying to read. The hard light of midday had robbed\r\nthe magic palace of its mystery and now it was no more than a temple on\r\nthe city wall, garish and shabby, but because she had seen it once in\r\nsuch an ecstasy it was never again quite commonplace; and often at dawn\r\nor at dusk, and again at night, she found herself able to recapture\r\nsomething of that beauty. What had seemed to her a mighty bastion was\r\nbut the city wall and on this, massive and dark, her eyes rested\r\ncontinually. Behind its crenellations lay the city in the dread grip of\r\nthe pestilence.\r\n\r\nVaguely she knew that terrible things were happening there, not from\r\nWalter who when she questioned him (for otherwise he rarely spoke to\r\nher) answered with a humorous nonchalance which sent a shiver down her\r\nspine; but from Waddington and from the amah. The people were dying at\r\nthe rate of a hundred a day, and hardly any of those who were attacked\r\nby the disease recovered from it; the gods had been brought out from the\r\nabandoned temples and placed in the streets; offerings were laid before\r\nthem and sacrifices made, but they did not stay the plague. The people\r\ndied so fast that it was hardly possible to bury them. In some houses\r\nthe whole family had been swept away and there was none to perform the\r\nfuneral rights. The officer commanding the troops was a masterful man\r\nand if the city was not given over to riot and arson it was due to his\r\ndetermination. He forced his soldiers to bury such as there was no one\r\nelse to bury and he had shot with his own hand an officer who demurred\r\nat entering a stricken house.\r\n\r\nKitty sometimes was so frightened that her heart sank within her and she\r\nwould tremble in every limb. It was very well to say that the risk was\r\nsmall if you took reasonable precautions: she was panic-stricken. She\r\nturned over in her mind crazy plans of escape. To get away, just to get\r\naway, she was prepared to set out as she was and make her way alone,\r\nwithout anything but what she stood up in, to some place of safety. She\r\nthought of throwing herself on the mercy of Waddington, telling him\r\neverything and beseeching him to help her to get back to Tching-Yen. If\r\nshe flung herself on her knees before her husband, and admitted that she\r\nwas frightened, frightened, even though he hated her now he must have\r\nenough human feeling in him to pity her.\r\n\r\nIt was out of the question. If she went, where could she go? Not to her\r\nmother; her mother would make her see very plainly that, having married\r\nher off, she counted on being rid of her; and besides she did not want\r\nto go to her mother. She wanted to go to Charlie, and he did not want\r\nher. She knew what he would say if she suddenly appeared before him. She\r\nsaw the sullen look of his face and the shrewd hardness behind his\r\ncharming eyes. It would be difficult for him to find words that sounded\r\nwell. She clenched her hands. She would have given anything to humiliate\r\nhim as he had humiliated her. Sometimes she was seized with such a\r\nfrenzy that she wished she had let Walter divorce her, ruining herself\r\nif only she could have ruined him too. Certain things he had said to her\r\nmade her blush with shame when she recalled them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxv_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first time she was alone with Waddington she brought the\r\nconversation round to Charlie. Waddington had spoken of him on the\r\nevening of their arrival. She pretended that he was no more than an\r\nacquaintance of her husband.\r\n\r\n"I never much cared for him," said Waddington. "I\'ve always thought him\r\na bore."\r\n\r\n"You must be very hard to please," returned Kitty, in the bright,\r\nchaffing way she could assume so easily. "I suppose he\'s far and away\r\nthe most popular man in Tching-Yen."\r\n\r\n"I know. That is his stock in trade. He\'s made a science of popularity.\r\nHe has the gift of making every one he meets feel that he is the one\r\nperson in the world he wants to see. He\'s always ready to do a service\r\nthat isn\'t any trouble to himself, and even if he doesn\'t do what you\r\nwant he manages to give you the impression that it\'s only because it\'s\r\nnot humanly possible."\r\n\r\n"That is surely an attractive trait."\r\n\r\n"Charm and nothing but charm at last grows a little tiresome, I think.\r\nIt\'s a relief then to deal with a man who isn\'t quite so delightful but\r\na little more sincere. I\'ve known Charlie Townsend for a good many years\r\nand once or twice I\'ve caught him with the mask off--you see, I never\r\nmattered, just a subordinate official in the Customs--and I know that he\r\ndoesn\'t in his heart give a damn for any one in the world but himself."\r\n\r\nKitty, lounging easily in her chair, looked at him with smiling eyes.\r\nShe turned her wedding-ring round and round her finger.\r\n\r\n"Of course he\'ll get on. He knows all the official ropes. Before I die I\r\nhave every belief that I shall address him as Your Excellency and stand\r\nup when he enters the room."\r\n\r\n"Most people think he deserves to get on. He\'s generally supposed to\r\nhave a great deal of ability."\r\n\r\n"Ability? What nonsense! He\'s a very stupid man. He gives you the\r\nimpression that he dashes off his work and gets it through from sheer\r\nbrilliancy. Nothing of the kind. He\'s as industrious as a Eurasian\r\nclerk."\r\n\r\n"How has he got the reputation of being so clever?"\r\n\r\n"There are many foolish people in the world and when a man in a rather\r\nhigh position puts on no frills, slaps them on the back, and tells them\r\nhe\'ll do anything in the world for them, they are very likely to think\r\nhim clever. And then of course, there\'s his wife. There\'s an able woman\r\nif you like. She has a good sound head and her advice is always worth\r\ntaking. As long as Charlie Townsend\'s got her to depend on he\'s pretty\r\nsafe never to do a foolish thing, and that\'s the first thing necessary\r\nfor a man to get on in Government service. They don\'t want clever men;\r\nclever men have ideas, and ideas cause trouble; they want men who have\r\ncharm and tact and who can be counted on never to make a blunder. Oh,\r\nyes, Charlie Townsend will get to the top of the tree all right."\r\n\r\n"I wonder why you dislike him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t dislike him."\r\n\r\n"But you like his wife better?" smiled Kitty.\r\n\r\n"I\'m an old-fashioned little man and I like a well-bred woman."\r\n\r\n"I wish she were well-dressed as well as well-bred."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t she dress well? I never noticed."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always heard that they were a devoted couple," said Kitty,\r\nwatching him through her eyelashes.\r\n\r\n"He\'s very fond of her: I will give him that credit. I think that is the\r\nmost decent thing about him."\r\n\r\n"Cold praise."\r\n\r\n"He has his little flirtations, but they\'re not serious. He\'s much too\r\ncunning to let them go to such lengths as might cause him inconvenience.\r\nAnd of course he isn\'t a passionate man; he\'s only a vain one. He likes\r\nadmiration. He\'s fat and forty now, he does himself too well, but he was\r\nvery good-looking when he first came to the Colony. I\'ve often heard his\r\nwife chaff him about his conquests."\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t take his flirtations very seriously?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, she knows they don\'t go very far. She says she\'d like to be\r\nable to make friends of the poor little things who fall to Charlie; but\r\nthey\'re always so common. She says it\'s really not very flattering to\r\nher that the women who fall in love with her husband are so uncommonly\r\nsecond-rate."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxvi_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Waddington left her Kitty thought over what he had so carelessly\r\nsaid. It hadn\'t been very pleasant to hear and she had had to make\r\nsomething of an effort not to show how much it touched her. It was\r\nbitter to think that all he said was true. She knew that Charlie was\r\nstupid and vain, hungry for flattery, and she remembered the complacency\r\nwith which he had told her little stories to prove his cleverness. He\r\nwas proud of a low cunning. How worthless must she be if she had given\r\nher heart so passionately to such a man because--because he had nice\r\neyes and a good figure! She wished to despise him, because so long as\r\nshe only hated him she knew that she was very near loving him. The way\r\nhe had treated her should have opened her eyes. Walter had always held\r\nhim in contempt. Oh, if she could only get him out of her mind\r\naltogether! And had his wife chaffed him about her obvious infatuation\r\nfor him? Dorothy would have liked to make a friend of her, but that she\r\nfound her second-rate. Kitty smiled a little: how indignant her mother\r\nwould be to know that her daughter was considered that!\r\n\r\nBut at night she dreamt of him again. She felt his arms pressing her\r\nclose and the hot passion of his kisses on her lips. What did it matter\r\nif he was fat and forty? She laughed with soft affection because he\r\nminded so much; she loved him all the more for his childlike vanity and\r\nshe could be sorry for him and comfort him. When she awoke tears were\r\nstreaming from her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe did not know why it seemed to her so tragic to cry in her sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxvii_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe saw Waddington every day, for he strolled up the hill to the Fanes\'\r\nbungalow when his day\'s work was done; and so after a week they had\r\narrived at an intimacy which under other circumstances they could\r\nscarcely have achieved in a year. Once when Kitty told him she didn\'t\r\nknow what she would do there without him he answered, laughing:\r\n\r\n"You see, you and I are the only people here who walk quite quietly and\r\npeaceably on solid ground. The nuns walk in heaven and your husband--in\r\ndarkness."\r\n\r\nThough she gave a careless laugh she wondered what he meant. She felt\r\nthat his merry little blue eyes were scanning her face with an amiable,\r\nbut disconcerting attention. She had discovered already that he was\r\nshrewd and she had a feeling that the relations between herself and\r\nWalter excited his cynical curiosity. She found a certain amusement in\r\nbaffling him. She liked him and she knew that he was kindly disposed\r\ntowards her. He was not witty nor brilliant, but he had a dry and\r\nincisive way of putting things which was diverting, and his funny,\r\nboyish face under that bald skull, all screwed up with laughter, made\r\nhis remarks sometimes extremely droll. He had lived for many years in\r\noutports, often with no man of his own colour to talk to, and his\r\npersonality had developed in eccentric freedom. He was full of fads and\r\noddities. His frankness was refreshing. He seemed to look upon life in a\r\nspirit of banter, and his ridicule of the Colony at Tching-Yen was acid;\r\nbut he laughed also at the Chinese officials in Mei-tan-fu and at the\r\ncholera which decimated the city. He could not tell a tragic story or\r\none of heroism without making it faintly absurd. He had many anecdotes\r\nof his adventures during twenty years in China, and you concluded from\r\nthem that the earth was a very grotesque, bizarre and ludicrous place.\r\n\r\nThough he denied that he was a Chinese scholar (he swore that the\r\nSinologues were as mad as march hares) he spoke the language with ease.\r\nHe read little and what he knew he had learned from conversation. But he\r\noften told Kitty stories from the Chinese novels and from Chinese\r\nhistory and though he told them with that airy badinage which was\r\nnatural to him it was good-humoured and even tender. It seemed to her\r\nthat, perhaps unconsciously, he had adopted the Chinese view that the\r\nEuropeans were barbarians and their life a folly: in China alone was it\r\nso led that a sensible man might discern in it a sort of reality. Here\r\nwas food for reflection: Kitty had never heard the Chinese spoken of as\r\nanything but decadent, dirty and unspeakable. It was as though the corner\r\nof a curtain were lifted for a moment, and she caught a glimpse of a\r\nworld rich with a colour and significance she had not dreamt of.\r\n\r\nHe sat there, talking, laughing and drinking.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think you drink too much," said Kitty to him boldly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my great pleasure in life," he answered. "Besides, it keeps the\r\ncholera out."\r\n\r\nWhen he left her he was generally drunk, but he carried his liquor well.\r\nIt made him hilarious, but not disagreeable.\r\n\r\nOne evening Walter, coming back earlier than usual, asked him to stay to\r\ndinner. A curious incident happened. They had their soup and their fish\r\nand then with the chicken a fresh green salad was handed to Kitty by the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n"Good God, you\'re not going to eat that," cried Waddington, as he saw\r\nKitty take some.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have it every night."\r\n\r\n"My wife likes it," said Walter.\r\n\r\nThe dish was handed to Waddington, but he shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Thank you very much, but I\'m not thinking of committing suicide just\r\nyet."\r\n\r\nWalter smiled grimly and helped himself. Waddington said nothing more,\r\nin fact he became strangely taciturn, and soon after dinner he left\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was true that they ate salad every night. Two days after their\r\narrival the cook, with the unconcern of the Chinese, had sent it in and\r\nKitty, without thinking, took some. Walter leaned forward quickly.\r\n\r\n"You oughtn\'t to eat that. The boy\'s crazy to serve it."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Kitty, looking at him full in the face.\r\n\r\n"It\'s always dangerous, it\'s madness now. You\'ll kill yourself."\r\n\r\n"I thought that was the idea," said Kitty.\r\n\r\nShe began to eat it coolly. She was seized with she knew not what spirit\r\nof bravado. She watched Walter with mocking eyes. She thought that he\r\ngrew a trifle pale, but when the salad was handed to him he helped\r\nhimself. The cook, finding they did not refuse it, sent them some in\r\nevery day and every day, courting death, they ate it. It was grotesque\r\nto take such a risk. Kitty, in terror of the disease, took it with the\r\nfeeling not only that she was thus maliciously avenging herself on\r\nWalter, but that she was flouting her own desperate fears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxviii_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the day after this that Waddington, coming to the bungalow in the\r\nafternoon, when he had sat a little asked Kitty if she would not go for\r\na stroll with him. She had not been out of the compound since her\r\narrival. She was glad enough.\r\n\r\n"There are not many walks, I\'m afraid," he said. "But we\'ll go to the\r\ntop of the hill."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, where the archway is. I\'ve seen it often from the terrace."\r\n\r\nOne of the boys opened the heavy doorway for them and they stepped out\r\ninto the dusty lane. They walked a few yards and then Kitty seizing\r\nWaddington\'s arm in fright, gave a startled cry.\r\n\r\n"Look!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the wall that surrounded the compound a man lay on his\r\nback with his legs stretched out and his arms thrown over his head. He\r\nwore the patched blue rags and the wild mop of hair of the Chinese\r\nbeggar.\r\n\r\n"He looks as if he were dead," Kitty gasped.\r\n\r\n"He is dead. Come along; you\'d better look the other way. I\'ll have him\r\nmoved when we come back."\r\n\r\nBut Kitty was trembling so violently that she could not stir.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never seen anyone dead before."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better hurry up and get used to it then, because you\'ll see a\r\ngood many before you\'ve done with this cheerful spot."\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and drew it in his arm. They walked for a little in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Did he die of cholera?" she said at last.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\nThey walked up the hill till they came to the archway. It was richly\r\ncarved. Fantastic and ironical it stood like a landmark in the\r\nsurrounding country. They sat down on the pedestal and faced the wide\r\nplain. The hill was sown close with the little green mounds of the dead,\r\nnot in lines but disorderly, so that you felt that beneath the surface\r\nthey must strangely jostle one another. The narrow causeway meandered\r\nsinuously among the green rice fields. A small boy seated on the neck of\r\na water-buffalo drove it slowly home, and three peasants in wide straw\r\nhats lolloped with sidelong gait under their heavy loads. After the heat\r\nof the day it was pleasant in that spot to catch the faint breeze of the\r\nevening and the wide expanse of country brought a sense of restful\r\nmelancholy to the tortured heart. But Kitty could not rid her mind of\r\nthe dead beggar.\r\n\r\n"How can you talk and laugh and drink whisky when people are dying all\r\naround you?" she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nWaddington did not answer. He turned round and looked at her, then he\r\nput his hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n"You know, this is no place for a woman," he said gravely. "Why don\'t\r\nyou go?"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a sidelong glance from beneath her long lashes and there\r\nwas the shadow of a smile on her lips.\r\n\r\n"I should have thought under the circumstances a wife\'s place was by her\r\nhusband\'s side."\r\n\r\n"When they telegraphed to me that you were coming with Fane I was\r\nastonished. But then it occurred to me that perhaps you\'d been a nurse\r\nand all this sort of thing was in the day\'s work. I expected you to be\r\none of those grim-visaged females who lead you a dog\'s life when you\'re\r\nill in hospital. You could have knocked me down with a feather when I\r\ncame into the bungalow and saw you sitting down and resting. You looked\r\nvery frail and white and tired."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t expect me to look my best after nine days on the road."\r\n\r\n"You look frail and white and tired now, and if you\'ll allow me to say\r\nso, desperately unhappy."\r\n\r\nKitty flushed because she could not help it, but she was able to give a\r\nlaugh that sounded merry enough.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you don\'t like my expression. The only reason I have for\r\nlooking unhappy is that since I was twelve I\'ve known that my nose was a\r\nlittle too long. But to cherish a secret sorrow is a most effective\r\npose: you can\'t think how many sweet young men have wanted to console\r\nme."\r\n\r\nWaddington\'s blue and shining eyes rested on her and she knew that he\r\ndid not believe a word she said. She did not care so long as he\r\npretended to.\r\n\r\n"I knew that you hadn\'t been married very long and I came to the\r\nconclusion that you and your husband were madly in love with each other.\r\nI couldn\'t believe that he had wished you to come, but perhaps you had\r\nabsolutely refused to stay behind."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a very reasonable explanation," she said lightly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it isn\'t the right one."\r\n\r\nShe waited for him to go on, fearful of what he was about to say, for\r\nshe had a pretty good idea of his shrewdness and was aware that he never\r\nhesitated to speak his mind, but unable to resist the desire to hear him\r\ntalk about herself.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think for a moment that you\'re in love with your husband. I\r\nthink you dislike him, I shouldn\'t be surprised if you hated him. But\r\nI\'m quite sure you\'re afraid of him."\r\n\r\nFor a moment she looked away. She did not mean to let Waddington see\r\nthat anything he said affected her.\r\n\r\n"I have a suspicion that you don\'t very much like my husband," she said\r\nwith cool irony.\r\n\r\n"I respect him. He has brains and character; and that, I may tell you,\r\nis a very unusual combination. I don\'t suppose you know what he is doing\r\nhere, because I don\'t think he\'s very expansive with you. If any man\r\nsingle-handed can put a stop to this frightful epidemic he\'s going to do\r\nit. He\'s doctoring the sick, cleaning the city up, trying to get the\r\ndrinking water pure. He doesn\'t mind where he goes nor what he does.\r\nHe\'s risking his life twenty times a day. He\'s got Colonel Y\xc3\xbc in his\r\npocket and he\'s induced him to put the troops at his disposal. He\'s even\r\nput a little pluck into the magistrate and the old man is really trying\r\nto do something. And the nuns at the convent swear by him. They think\r\nhe\'s a hero."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"After all this isn\'t his job, is it? He\'s a bacteriologist. There was\r\nno call for him to come here. He doesn\'t give me the impression that\r\nhe\'s moved by compassion for all these dying Chinamen. Watson was\r\ndifferent. He loved the human race. Though he was a missionary it didn\'t\r\nmake any difference to him if they were Christian, Buddhist or\r\nConfucian; they were just human beings. Your husband isn\'t here because\r\nhe cares a damn if a hundred thousand Chinese die of cholera; he isn\'t\r\nhere either in the interests of science. Why is he here?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d better ask him."\r\n\r\n"It interests me to see you together. I sometimes wonder how you behave\r\nwhen you\'re alone. When I\'m there you\'re acting, both of you, and acting\r\ndamned badly, by George. You\'d neither of you get thirty bob a week in a\r\ntouring company if that\'s the best you can do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean," smiled Kitty, keeping up a pretence of\r\nfrivolity which she knew did not deceive.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a very pretty woman. It\'s funny that your husband should never\r\nlook at you. When he speaks to you it sounds as though it were not his\r\nvoice but somebody\'s else\'s."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he doesn\'t love me?" asked Kitty in a low voice, hoarsely,\r\nputting aside suddenly her lightness.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I don\'t know if you fill him with such a repulsion that\r\nit gives him goose-flesh to be near you or if he\'s burning with a love\r\nthat for some reason he will not allow himself to show. I\'ve asked\r\nmyself if you\'re both here to commit suicide."\r\n\r\nKitty had seen the startled glance and then the scrutinising look\r\nWaddington gave them when the incident of the salad took place.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re attaching too much importance to a few lettuce leaves,"\r\nshe said flippantly. She rose. "Shall we go home? I\'m sure you want a\r\nwhisky and soda."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not a heroine at all events. You\'re frightened to death. Are you\r\nsure you don\'t want to go away?"\r\n\r\n"What has it got to do with you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll help you."\r\n\r\n"Are _you_ going to fall to my look of secret sorrow? Look at my profile\r\nand tell me if my nose isn\'t a trifle too long."\r\n\r\nHe gazed at her reflectively, that malicious, ironical look in his\r\nbright eyes, but mingled with it, a shadow, like a tree standing at a\r\nriver\'s edge and its reflection in the water, was an expression of\r\nsingular kindliness. It brought sudden tears to Kitty\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Must you stay?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThey passed under the flamboyant archway and walked down the hill. When\r\nthey came to the compound they saw the body of the dead beggar. He took\r\nher arm, but she released herself. She stood still.\r\n\r\n"It\'s dreadful, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"What? Death."\r\n\r\n"Yes. It makes everything else seem so horribly trivial. He doesn\'t look\r\nhuman. When you look at him you can hardly persuade yourself that he\'s\r\never been alive. It\'s hard to think that not so very many years ago he\r\nwas just a little boy tearing down the hill and flying a kite."\r\n\r\nShe could not hold back the sob that choked her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xxxix_\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later Waddington, sitting with Kitty, a long glass of whisky\r\nand soda in his hand, began to speak to her of the convent.\r\n\r\n"The Mother Superior is a very remarkable woman," he said. "The Sisters\r\ntell me that she belongs to one of the greatest families in France, but\r\nthey won\'t tell me which; the Mother Superior, they say, doesn\'t wish it\r\nto be talked of."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you ask her if it interests you?" smiled Kitty.\r\n\r\n"If you knew her you\'d know it was impossible to ask her an indiscreet\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"She must certainly be very remarkable if she can impress you with awe."\r\n\r\n"I am the bearer of a message from her to you. She has asked me to say\r\nthat, though of course you may not wish to adventure into the very\r\ncentre of the epidemic, if you do not mind that it will give her great\r\npleasure to show you the convent."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind of her. I shouldn\'t have thought she was aware of my\r\nexistence."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve spoken about you; I go there two or three times a week just now to\r\nsee if there\'s anything I can do; and I daresay your husband has told\r\nthem about you. You must be prepared to find that they have an unbounded\r\nadmiration for him."\r\n\r\n"Are you a Catholic?"\r\n\r\nHis malicious eyes twinkled and his funny little face was puckered with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n"Why are you grinning at me?" asked Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Can any good come out of Galilee? No, I\'m not a Catholic. I describe\r\nmyself as a member of the Church of England, which, I suppose, is an\r\ninoffensive way of saying that you don\'t believe in anything very much.\r\n. . . When the Mother Superior came here ten years ago she brought seven\r\nnuns with her and of those all but three are dead. You see, at the best\r\nof times, Mei-tan-fu is not a health resort. They live in the very\r\nmiddle of the city, in the poorest district, they work very hard and\r\nthey never have a holiday."\r\n\r\n"But are there only three and the Mother Superior now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, more have taken their places. There are six of them now. When\r\none of them died of cholera at the beginning of the epidemic two others\r\ncame up from Canton."\r\n\r\nKitty shivered a little.\r\n\r\n"Are you cold?"\r\n\r\n"No, it was only some one walking over my grave."\r\n\r\n"When they leave France they leave it for ever. They\'re not like the\r\nProtestant missionaries who have a year\'s leave every now and then. I\r\nalways think that must be the hardest thing of all. We English have no\r\nvery strong attachment to the soil, we can make ourselves at home in any\r\npart of the world, but the French, I think, have an attachment to their\r\ncountry which is almost a physical bond. They\'re never really at ease\r\nwhen they\'re out of it. It always seems to me very moving that these\r\nwomen should make just that sacrifice. I suppose if I _were_ a Catholic\r\nit would seem very natural to me."\r\n\r\nKitty looked at him coolly. She could not quite understand the emotion\r\nwith which the little man spoke and she asked herself whether it was a\r\npose. He had drunk a good deal of whisky and perhaps he was not quite\r\nsober.\r\n\r\n"Come and see for yourself," he said, with his bantering smile, quickly\r\nreading her thought. "It\'s not nearly so risky as eating a tomato."\r\n\r\n"If you\'re not frightened there\'s no reason why I should be."\r\n\r\n"I think it\'ll amuse you. It\'s like a little bit of France."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xl_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey crossed the river in a sampan. A chair was waiting for Kitty at the\r\nlanding-stage and she was carried up the hill to the water-gate. It was\r\nthrough this that the coolies came to fetch water from the river and\r\nthey hurried to and fro with huge buckets hanging from the yoke on their\r\nshoulder, splashing the causeway so that it was as wet as though it had\r\nheavily rained. Kitty\'s bearers gave short, sharp cries to urge them to\r\nmake way.\r\n\r\n"Of course all business is at a standstill," said Waddington, walking by\r\nher side. "Under normal circumstances you have to fight your way through\r\nthe coolies carrying loads up and down to the junks."\r\n\r\nThe street was narrow and winding so that Kitty lost all sense of the\r\ndirection in which she was going. Many of the shops were closed. She had\r\ngrown used on the journey up to the untidiness of a Chinese street, but\r\nhere was the litter of weeks, garbage and refuse; and the stench was so\r\nhorrible that she had to put her handkerchief to her face. Passing\r\nthrough Chinese cities she had been incommoded by the staring of the\r\ncrowd, but now she noticed that no more than an indifferent glance was\r\nthrown at her. The passers-by, scattered rather than as usual thronging,\r\nseemed intent on their own affairs. They were cowed and listless. Now\r\nand then as they went by a house they heard the beating of gongs and the\r\nshrill, sustained lament of unknown instruments. Behind those closed\r\ndoors one was lying dead.\r\n\r\n"Here we are," said Waddington at last.\r\n\r\nThe chair was set down at a small doorway, surmounted by a cross, in a\r\nlong white wall, and Kitty stepped out. He rang the bell.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t expect anything very grand, you know. They\'re miserably\r\npoor."\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by a Chinese girl, and after a word or two from\r\nWaddington she led them into a little room on the side of the corridor.\r\nIt contained a large table covered with a chequered oilcloth and round\r\nthe walls was a set of stiff chairs. At one end of the room was a\r\nstatue, in plaster, of the Blessed Virgin. In a moment a nun came in,\r\nshort and plump, with a homely face, red cheeks and merry eyes.\r\nWaddington, introducing Kitty to her, called her S\xc5\x93ur St. Joseph.\r\n\r\n"_C\'est la dame du docteur?_" she asked, beaming, and then added that\r\nthe Mother Superior would join them directly.\r\n\r\nSister St. Joseph could speak no English and Kitty\'s French was halting;\r\nbut Waddington, fluent, voluble and inaccurate, maintained a stream of\r\nfacetious comment, which convulsed the good-humoured nun. Her cheerful,\r\neasy laughter not a little astonished Kitty. She had an idea that the\r\nreligious were always grave and this sweet and childlike merriment\r\ntouched her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xli_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe door opened, to Kitty\'s fancy not quite naturally, but as though it\r\nswung back of itself on its hinges, and the Mother Superior entered the\r\nlittle room. She stood for an instant on the threshold and a grave smile\r\nhovered upon her lips as she looked at the laughing Sister and\r\nWaddington\'s puckered, clownish face. Then she came forward and held out\r\nher hand to Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Fane?" She spoke in English with a good deal of accent, but with a\r\ncorrect pronunciation, and she gave the shadow of a bow. "It is a great\r\npleasure to me to make the acquaintance of the wife of our good and\r\nbrave doctor."\r\n\r\nKitty felt that the Superior\'s eyes held her in a long and unembarrassed\r\nlook of appraisal. It was so frank that it was not uncivil; you felt\r\nthat here was a woman whose business it was to form an opinion of others\r\nand to whom it never occurred that subterfuge was necessary. With a\r\ndignified affability she motioned to her visitors to take chairs and\r\nherself sat down. Sister St. Joseph, smiling still but silent, stood at\r\nthe side but a little behind the Superior.\r\n\r\n"I know you English like tea," said the Mother Superior, "and I have\r\nordered some. But I must make my excuses if it is served in the Chinese\r\nfashion. I know that Mr. Waddington prefers whisky, but that I am afraid\r\nI cannot offer him."\r\n\r\nShe smiled and there was a hint of malice in her grave eyes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, _ma m\xc3\xa8re_, you speak as if I were a confirmed drunkard."\r\n\r\n"I wish you could say that you never drink, Mr. Waddington."\r\n\r\n"I can at all events say that I never drink except to excess."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior laughed and translated into French for Sister St.\r\nJoseph the flippant remark. She looked at him with lingering, friendly\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"We must make allowances for Mr. Waddington because two or three times\r\nwhen we had no money at all and did not know how we were to feed our\r\norphans Mr. Waddington came to our rescue."\r\n\r\nThe convert who had opened the door for them now came in with a tray on\r\nwhich were Chinese cups, a tea-pot and a little plate of the French\r\ncakes called _Madeleines_.\r\n\r\n"You must eat the _Madeleines_," said the Mother Superior, "because\r\nSister St. Joseph made them for you herself this morning."\r\n\r\nThey talked of commonplace things. The Mother Superior asked Kitty how\r\nlong she had been in China and if the journey from Tching-Yen had\r\ngreatly tired her. She asked her if she had been in France and if she\r\ndid not find the climate of Tching-Yen trying. It was a conversation,\r\ntrivial but friendly, which gained a peculiar savour from the\r\ncircumstances. The parlour was very quiet, so that you could hardly\r\nbelieve that you were in the midst of a populous city. Peace dwelt\r\nthere. And yet all round about the epidemic was raging and the people,\r\nterrified and restless, were kept in check but by the strong will of a\r\nsoldier who was more than half a brigand. Within the convent walls the\r\ninfirmary was crowded with sick and dying soldiers, and of the orphans\r\nin the nuns\' charge a quarter were dead.\r\n\r\nKitty, impressed she hardly knew why, observed the grave lady who asked\r\nher these amiable questions. She was dressed in white and the only\r\ncolour on her habit was the red heart that burned on her breast. She was\r\na woman of middle age, she might have been forty or fifty, it was\r\nimpossible to say, for there were few wrinkles on her smooth, pale face,\r\nand you received the impression that she was far from young chiefly from\r\nthe dignity of her bearing, her assurance, and the emaciation of her\r\nstrong and beautiful hands. The face was long with a large mouth and\r\nlarge, even teeth; the nose though not small, was delicate and\r\nsensitive; but it was the eyes, under their thin black brows, which gave\r\nher face its intense and tragic character. They were very large, black,\r\nand though not exactly cold, by their calm steadiness strangely\r\ncompelling. Your first thought when you looked at the Mother Superior\r\nwas that as a girl she must have been beautiful, but in a moment you\r\nrealised that this was a woman whose beauty, depending on character, had\r\ngrown with advancing years. Her voice was deep, low and controlled, and\r\nwhether she spoke in English or in French she spoke slowly. But the most\r\nstriking thing about her was the air she had of authority tempered by\r\nChristian charity; you felt in her the habit of command. To be obeyed\r\nwas natural to her, but she accepted obedience with humility. You could\r\nnot fail to see that she was deeply conscious of the authority of the\r\nchurch which upheld her. But Kitty had a surmise that notwithstanding\r\nher austere demeanour she had for human frailty a human tolerance and it\r\nwas impossible to look at her grave smile when she listened to\r\nWaddington, unabashed, talking nonsense, without being sure that she had\r\na lively sense of the ridiculous.\r\n\r\nBut there was some other quality in her which Kitty vaguely felt, but\r\ncould not put a name to. It was something that notwithstanding the\r\nMother Superior\'s cordiality and the exquisite manners which made Kitty\r\nfeel like an awkward school-girl, held her at a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xlii_\r\n\r\n\r\n"_MONSIEUR ne mange rien_," said Sister St. Joseph.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur\'s palate is ruined by Manchu cooking," replied the Mother\r\nSuperior.\r\n\r\nThe smile left Sister St. Joseph\'s face and she assumed an expression of\r\nsome primness. Waddington, a roguish glance in his eyes, took another\r\ncake. Kitty did not understand the incident.\r\n\r\n"To prove to you how unjust you are, _ma m\xc3\xa8re_, I will ruin the\r\nexcellent dinner that awaits me."\r\n\r\n"If Mrs. Fane would like to see over the convent I shall be glad to show\r\nher." The Mother Superior turned to Kitty with a deprecating smile. "I\r\nam sorry you should see it just now when everything is in disorder. We\r\nhave so much work and not enough Sisters to do it. Colonel Y\xc3\xbc has\r\ninsisted on our putting our infirmary at the disposal of sick soldiers\r\nand we have had to make the _r\xc3\xa9fectoire_ into an infirmary for our\r\norphans."\r\n\r\nShe stood at the door to allow Kitty to pass and together, followed by\r\nSister St. Joseph and Waddington, they walked along cool white\r\ncorridors. They went first into a large, bare room where a number of\r\nChinese girls were working at elaborate embroideries. They stood up when\r\nthe visitors entered and the Mother Superior showed Kitty specimens of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n"We go on with it notwithstanding the epidemic because it takes their\r\nminds off the danger."\r\n\r\nThey went to a second room in which younger girls were doing plain\r\nsewing, hemming and stitching, and then into a third where there were\r\nonly tiny children under the charge of a Chinese convert. They were\r\nplaying noisily and when the Mother Superior came in they crowded round\r\nher, mites of two and three, with their black Chinese eyes and their\r\nblack hair; and they seized her hands and hid themselves in her great\r\nskirts. An enchanting smile lit up her grave face, and she fondled them;\r\nshe spoke little chaffing words which Kitty, ignorant though she was of\r\nChinese, could tell were like caresses. She shuddered a little, for in\r\ntheir uniform dress, sallow-skinned, stunted, with their flat noses,\r\nthey looked to her hardly human. They were repulsive. But the Mother\r\nSuperior stood among them like Charity itself. When she wished to leave\r\nthe room they would not let her go, but clung to her, so that, with\r\nsmiling expostulations, she had to use a gentle force to free herself.\r\nThey at all events found nothing terrifying in this great lady.\r\n\r\n"You know of course," she said, as they walked along another corridor,\r\n"that they are only orphans in the sense that their parents have wished\r\nto be rid of them. We give them a few cash for every child that is\r\nbrought in, otherwise they will not take the trouble, but do away with\r\nthem." She turned to the Sister. "Have any come to-day?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Four."\r\n\r\n"Now, with the cholera, they are more than ever anxious not to be\r\nburdened with useless girls."\r\n\r\nShe showed Kitty the dormitories and then they passed a door on which\r\nwas painted the word _infirmerie_. Kitty heard groans and loud cries and\r\nsounds as though beings not human were in pain.\r\n\r\n"I will not show you the infirmary," said the Mother Superior in her\r\nplacid tones. "It is not a sight that one would wish to see." A thought\r\nstruck her. "I wonder if Dr. Fane is there?"\r\n\r\nShe looked interrogatively at the Sister and she, with her merry smile,\r\nopened the door and slipped in. Kitty shrank back as the open door\r\nallowed her to hear more horribly the tumult within. Sister St. Joseph\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\n"No, he has been and will not be back again till later."\r\n\r\n"What about number six?"\r\n\r\n"_Pauvre gar\xc3\xa7on_, he\'s dead."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior crossed herself and her lips moved in a short and\r\nsilent prayer.\r\n\r\nThey passed by a courtyard and Kitty\'s eyes fell upon two long shapes\r\nthat lay side by side on the ground covered with a piece of blue cotton.\r\nThe Superior turned to Waddington.\r\n\r\n"We are so short of beds that we have to put two patients in one and the\r\nmoment a sick man dies he must be bundled out in order to make room for\r\nanother." But she gave Kitty a smile. "Now we will show you our chapel.\r\nWe are very proud of it. One of our friends in France sent us a little\r\nwhile ago a life-size statue of the Blessed Virgin."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xliii_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chapel was no more than a long low room with white-washed walls and\r\nrows of deal benches; at the end was the altar on which stood the image;\r\nit was in plaster of Paris painted in crude colours; it was very bright\r\nand new and garish. Behind it was a picture in oils of the Crucifixion\r\nwith the two Maries at the foot of the Cross in extravagant attitudes of\r\ngrief. The drawing was bad and the dark pigments were put on with an eye\r\nthat knew nothing of the beauty of colour. Around the walls were the\r\nStations of the Cross painted by the same unfortunate hand. The chapel\r\nwas hideous and vulgar.\r\n\r\nThe two nuns on entering knelt down to say a prayer and then, rising, the\r\nMother Superior began once more to chat with Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Everything that can be broken is broken when it comes here, but the\r\nstatue presented to us by our benefactor came from Paris without so much\r\nas the smallest chip. There is no doubt that it was a miracle."\r\n\r\nWaddington\'s malicious eyes gleamed, but he held his tongue.\r\n\r\n"The altarpiece and the Stations of the Cross were painted by one of our\r\nSisters, S\xc5\x93ur St. Anselme." The Mother Superior crossed herself. "She\r\nwas a real artist. Unfortunately, she fell a victim to the epidemic. Do\r\nyou not think that they are very beautiful?"\r\n\r\nKitty faltered an affirmative. On the altar were bunches of paper\r\nflowers and the candlesticks were distractingly ornate.\r\n\r\n"We have the privilege of keeping here the Blessed Sacrament."\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said Kitty, not understanding.\r\n\r\n"It has been a great comfort to us during this time of so terrible\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\nThey left the chapel and retraced their steps to the parlour in which\r\nthey had first sat.\r\n\r\n"Would you like to see the babies that came in this morning before you\r\ngo?"\r\n\r\n"Very much," said Kitty.\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior led them into a tiny room on the other side of the\r\npassage. On a table, under a cloth, there was a singular wriggling. The\r\nSister drew back the cloth and displayed four tiny, naked infants. They\r\nwere very red and they made funny restless movements with their arms and\r\nlegs; their quaint little Chinese faces were screwed up into strange\r\ngrimaces. They looked hardly human; queer animals of an unknown species,\r\nand yet there was something singularly moving in the sight. The Mother\r\nSuperior looked at them with an amused smile.\r\n\r\n"They seem very lively. Sometimes they are brought in only to die. Of\r\ncourse we baptize them the moment they come."\r\n\r\n"The lady\'s husband will be pleased with them," said Sister St. Joseph.\r\n"I think he could play by the hour with the babies. When they cry he has\r\nonly to take them up, and he makes them comfortable in the crook of his\r\narm, so that they laugh with delight."\r\n\r\nThen Kitty and Waddington found themselves at the door. Kitty gravely\r\nthanked the Mother Superior for the trouble she had taken. The nun bowed\r\nwith a condescension that was at once dignified and affable.\r\n\r\n"It has been a great pleasure. You do not know how kind and helpful your\r\nhusband has been to us. He has been sent to us by Heaven. I am glad that\r\nyou came with him. When he goes home it must be a great comfort to him\r\nto have you there with your love and your--your sweet face. You must\r\ntake care of him and not let him work too hard. You must look after him\r\nfor all our sakes."\r\n\r\nKitty flushed. She did not know what to say. The Mother Superior held\r\nout her hand and while she held it Kitty was conscious of those cool,\r\nthoughtful eyes which rested on her with detachment and yet with\r\nsomething that looked like a profound understanding.\r\n\r\nSister St. Joseph closed the door behind them and Kitty got into her\r\nchair. They went back through the narrow, winding streets. Waddington\r\nmade a casual remark; Kitty did not answer. He looked round, but the\r\nside curtains of the chair were drawn and he could not see her. He\r\nwalked on in silence. But when they reached the river and she stepped\r\nout to his surprise he saw that her eyes were streaming with tears.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" he asked, his face puckered into an expression of\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n"Nothing." She tried to smile. "Only foolishness."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xliv_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone once more in the sordid parlour of the dead missionary, lying on\r\nthe long chair that faced the window, her abstracted eyes on the temple\r\nacross the river (now again at the approach of evening aerial and\r\nlovely), Kitty tried to set in order the feelings in her heart. She\r\nwould never have believed that this visit to the convent could so have\r\nmoved her. She had gone from curiosity. She had nothing else to do and\r\nafter looking for so many days at the walled city across the water she\r\nwas not unwilling to have at least a glimpse of its mysterious streets.\r\n\r\nBut once within the convent it had seemed to her that she was\r\ntransported into another world situated strangely neither in space nor\r\ntime. Those bare rooms and the white corridors, austere and simple,\r\nseemed to possess the spirit of something remote and mystical. The\r\nlittle chapel, so ugly and vulgar, in its very crudeness was pathetic;\r\nit had something which was wanting in the greatness of a cathedral, with\r\nits stained glass and its pictures it was very humble; and the faith\r\nwhich had adorned it, the affection which cherished it, had endued it\r\nwith a delicate beauty of the soul. The methodical way in which the\r\nconvent\'s work was carried on in the midst of the pestilence showed a\r\ncoolness in the face of danger and a practical sense, almost ironical it\r\nwas so matter of fact, which were deeply impressive. In Kitty\'s ears\r\nrang still the ghastly sounds she heard when for a moment Sister St.\r\nJoseph opened the infirmary door.\r\n\r\nIt was unexpected the way they had spoken of Walter. First the Sister\r\nand then the Mother Superior herself, and the tone of her voice had been\r\nvery gentle when she praised him. Oddly enough it gave her a little\r\nthrill of pride to know that they thought so well of him. Waddington\r\nalso had told something of what Walter was doing; but it was not only\r\nhis competence that the nuns praised (in Tching-Yen she had known that\r\nhe was thought clever), they spoke of his thoughtfulness and his\r\ntenderness. Of course he could be very tender. He was at his best when\r\nyou were ill; he was too intelligent to exasperate, and his touch was\r\npleasant, cool and soothing. By some magic he seemed able by his mere\r\npresence to relieve your suffering. She knew that she would never see\r\nagain in his eyes the look of affection which she had once been so used\r\nto that she found it merely exasperating. She knew now how immense was\r\nhis capacity for loving; in some odd way he was pouring it out on these\r\nwretched sick who had only him to look to. She did not feel jealousy,\r\nbut a sense of emptiness; it was as though a support that she had grown\r\nso accustomed to as not to realise its presence were suddenly withdrawn\r\nfrom her so that she swayed this way and that like a thing that was\r\ntop-heavy.\r\n\r\nShe had only contempt for herself because once she had felt contempt for\r\nWalter. He must have known how she regarded him and he had accepted her\r\nestimate without bitterness. She was a fool and he knew it and because\r\nhe loved her it had made no difference to him. She did not hate him now,\r\nnor feel resentment of him, but fear rather and perplexity. She could\r\nnot but admit that he had remarkable qualities, sometimes she thought\r\nthat there was even in him a strange and unattractive greatness; it was\r\ncurious then that she could not love him, but loved still a man whose\r\nworthlessness was now so clear to her. After thinking, thinking, all\r\nthrough those long days she rated accurately Charles Townsend\'s value;\r\nhe was a common fellow and his qualities were second-rate. If she could\r\nonly tear from her heart the love that still lingered there! She tried\r\nnot to think of him.\r\n\r\nWaddington too thought highly of Walter. She alone had been blind to his\r\nmerit. Why? Because he loved her and she did not love him. What was it\r\nin the human heart that made you despise a man because he loved you? But\r\nWaddington had confessed that he did not like Walter. Men didn\'t. It was\r\neasy to see that those two nuns had for him a feeling which was very\r\nlike affection. He was different with women; notwithstanding his shyness\r\nyou felt in him an exquisite kindliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xlv_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut after all it was the nuns that had most deeply touched her. Sister\r\nSt. Joseph, with her merry face and apple red cheeks; she had been one\r\nof the little band that came out to China with the Mother Superior ten\r\nyears before and she had seen one after another of her companions die of\r\ndisease, privation and homesickness; and yet she remained cheerful and\r\nhappy. What was it that gave her that na\xc3\xafve and charming humour? And\r\nthe Mother Superior. Kitty in fancy stood again in her presence and once\r\nmore she felt humble and ashamed. Though she was so simple and\r\nunaffected she had a native dignity which inspired awe, and you could\r\nnot imagine that any one could treat her without respect. Sister St.\r\nJoseph by the way she stood, by every small gesture and the intonation\r\nof her answers, had shown the deep submission in which she held herself;\r\nand Waddington, frivolous and impertinent, had shown by his tone that he\r\nwas not quite at his ease. Kitty thought it unnecessary to have told her\r\nthat the Mother Superior belonged to one of the great families of\r\nFrance; there was that in her bearing which suggested ancient race; and\r\nshe had the authority of one who has never known that it is possible to\r\nbe disobeyed. She had the condescension of a great lady and the humility\r\nof a saint. There was in her strong, handsome and ravaged face an\r\nausterity that was passionate; and at the same time she had a solicitude\r\nand a gentleness which permitted those little children to cluster, noisy\r\nand unafraid, in the assurance of her deep affection. When she had\r\nlooked at the four new-born babies she had worn a smile that was sweet\r\nand yet profound: it was like a ray of sunshine on a wild and desolate\r\nheath. What Sister St. Joseph had said so carelessly of Walter moved\r\nKitty strangely; she knew that he had desperately wanted her to bear a\r\nchild, but she had never suspected from his reticence that he was\r\ncapable with a baby of showing without embarrassment a charming and\r\nplayful tenderness. Most men were silly and awkward with babies. How\r\nstrange he was!\r\n\r\nBut to all that moving experience there had been a shadow (a dark lining\r\nto the silver cloud), insistent and plain, which disconcerted her. In\r\nthe sober gaiety of Sister St. Joseph, and much more in the beautiful\r\ncourtesy of the Mother Superior, she had felt an aloofness which\r\noppressed her. They were friendly and even cordial, but at the same time\r\nthey held something back, she knew not what, so that she was conscious\r\nthat she was nothing but a casual stranger. There was a barrier between\r\nher and them. They spoke a different language not only of the tongue but\r\nof the heart. And when the door was closed upon her she felt that they\r\nhad put her out of their minds so completely, going about their\r\nneglected work again without delay, that for them she might never have\r\nexisted. She felt shut out not only from that poor little convent, but\r\nfrom some mysterious garden of the spirit after which with all her soul\r\nshe hankered. She felt on a sudden alone as she had never felt alone\r\nbefore. That was why she had wept.\r\n\r\nAnd now, throwing back her head wearily, she sighed: "Oh, I\'m so\r\nworthless."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xlvi_\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Walter came back to the bungalow a little earlier than\r\nusual. Kitty was lying on the long chair by the open window. It was\r\nnearly dark.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want a lamp?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll bring it when dinner is ready."\r\n\r\nHe talked to her always quite casually, of trifling things, as though\r\nthey were friendly acquaintances, and there was never anything in his\r\nmanner to suggest that he harboured malice in his heart. He never met\r\nher eyes and he never smiled. He was scrupulously polite.\r\n\r\n"Walter, what do you propose we should do if we get through the\r\nepidemic?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe waited for a moment before answering. She could not see his face.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t thought."\r\n\r\nIn the old days she said carelessly whatever came into her head; it\r\nnever occurred to her to think before she spoke; but now she was afraid\r\nof him; she felt her lips tremble and her heart beat painfully.\r\n\r\n"I went to the convent this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"So I heard."\r\n\r\nShe forced herself to speak though she could hardly frame the words.\r\n\r\n"Did you really want me to die when you brought me here?"\r\n\r\n"If I were you I\'d leave well alone, Kitty. I don\'t think any good will\r\ncome of talking about what we should do much better to forget."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t forget; neither do I. I\'ve been thinking a great deal\r\nsince I came here. Won\'t you listen to what I have to say?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"I treated you very badly. I was unfaithful to you."\r\n\r\nHe stood stock still. His immobility was strangely terrifying.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether you\'ll understand what I mean. That sort of thing\r\ndoesn\'t mean very much to a woman when it\'s over. I think women have\r\nnever quite understood the attitude that men take up." She spoke\r\nabruptly, in a voice she would hardly have recognised as her own. "You\r\nknow what Charlie was and you knew what he\'d do. Well, you were quite\r\nright. He\'s a worthless creature. I suppose I shouldn\'t have been taken\r\nin by him if I hadn\'t been as worthless as he. I don\'t ask you to\r\nforgive me. I don\'t ask you to love me as you used to love me. But\r\ncouldn\'t we be friends? With all these people dying in thousands round\r\nus, and with those nuns in their convent . . ."\r\n\r\n"What have they got to do with it?" he interrupted.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t quite explain. I had such a singular feeling when I went there\r\nto-day. It all seems to mean so much. It\'s all so terrible and their\r\nself-sacrifice is so wonderful; I can\'t help feeling it\'s absurd and\r\ndisproportionate, if you understand what I mean, to distress yourself\r\nbecause a foolish woman has been unfaithful to you. I\'m much too\r\nworthless and insignificant for you to give me a thought."\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, but he did not move away; he seemed to be waiting for\r\nher to continue.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Waddington and the nuns have told me such wonderful things about\r\nyou. I\'m very proud of you, Walter."\r\n\r\n"You used not to be; you used to feel contempt for me. Don\'t you still?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know that I\'m afraid of you?"\r\n\r\nAgain he was silent.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you," he said at last. "I don\'t know what it is you\r\nwant."\r\n\r\n"Nothing for myself. I only want you to be a little less unhappy."\r\n\r\nShe felt him stiffen and his voice was very cold when he answered.\r\n\r\n"You\'re mistaken in thinking I\'m unhappy. I have a great deal too much\r\nto do to think of you very often."\r\n\r\n"I have wondered if the nuns would allow me to go and work at the\r\nconvent. They are very short handed and if I could be of any help I\r\nshould be grateful to them."\r\n\r\n"It is not easy work or pleasant work. I doubt if it would amuse you\r\nlong."\r\n\r\n"Do you absolutely despise me, Walter?"\r\n\r\n"No." He hesitated and his voice was strange. "I despise myself."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xlvii_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after dinner. As usual Walter sat by the lamp and read. He read\r\nevery evening till Kitty went to bed and then went into a laboratory\r\nwhich he had fitted up in one of the bungalow\'s empty rooms. Here he\r\nworked late into the night. He slept little. He was occupied with she\r\nknew not what experiments. He told her nothing of his work; but even in\r\nthe old days he had been reticent on this: he was not by nature\r\nexpansive. She thought deeply of what he had just said to her: the\r\nconversation had led to nothing. She knew him so little that she could\r\nnot be sure if he was speaking the truth or not. Was it possible that,\r\nwhereas he now existed so ominously for her, she had entirely ceased to\r\nexist for him? Her conversation which had entertained him once because\r\nhe loved her, now that he loved her no longer might be merely tedious to\r\nhim. It mortified her.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him. The light of the lamp displayed his profile as though\r\nit were a cameo. With his regular and finely-cut features it was very\r\ndistinguished, but it was more than severe, it was grim: that immobility\r\nof his, only his eyes moving as he perused each page, was vaguely\r\nterrifying. Who would have thought that this hard face could be melted\r\nby passion to such a tenderness of expression? She knew and it excited\r\nin her a little shiver of distaste. It was strange that though he was\r\ngood-looking as well as honest, reliable and talented, it had been so\r\nimpossible for her to love him. It was a relief that she need never\r\nagain submit to his caresses.\r\n\r\nHe would not answer when she had asked him whether in forcing her to\r\ncome here he had really wished to kill her. The mystery of this\r\nfascinated and horrified her. He was so extraordinarily kind; it was\r\nincredible that he could have had such a devilish intention. He must\r\nhave suggested it only to frighten her and to get back on Charlie (that\r\nwould be like his sardonic humour) and then from obstinacy or from fear\r\nof looking foolish insisted on her going through with it.\r\n\r\nYes, he said he despised himself. What did he mean by that? Once again\r\nKitty looked at his calm cool face. She might not even be in the room,\r\nhe was so unconscious of her.\r\n\r\n"Why do you despise yourself?" she asked, hardly knowing that she spoke,\r\nas though she were continuing without a break the earlier conversation.\r\n\r\nHe put down his book and observed her reflectively. He seemed to gather\r\nhis thoughts from a remote distance.\r\n\r\n"Because I loved you."\r\n\r\nShe flushed and looked away. She could not bear his cold, steady and\r\nappraising gaze. She understood what he meant. It was a little while\r\nbefore she answered.\r\n\r\n"I think you do me an injustice," she said. "It\'s not fair to blame me\r\nbecause I was silly and frivolous and vulgar. I was brought up like\r\nthat. All the girls I know are like that. . . . It\'s like reproaching\r\nsomeone who has no ear for music because he\'s bored at a symphony\r\nconcert. Is it fair to blame me because you ascribed to me qualities I\r\nhadn\'t got? I never tried to deceive you by pretending I was anything I\r\nwasn\'t. I was just pretty and gay. You don\'t ask for a pearl necklace or\r\na sable coat at a booth in a fair; you ask for a tin trumpet and a toy\r\nballoon."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t blame you."\r\n\r\nHis voice was weary. She was beginning to feel a trifle impatient with\r\nhim. Why could he not realise, what suddenly had become so clear to her,\r\nthat beside all the terror of death under whose shadow they lay and\r\nbeside the awe of the beauty which she had caught a glimpse of that day,\r\ntheir own affairs were trivial? What did it really matter if a silly\r\nwoman had committed adultery and why should her husband, face to face\r\nwith the sublime, give it a thought? It was strange that Walter with all\r\nhis cleverness should have so little sense of proportion. Because he had\r\ndressed a doll in gorgeous robes and set her in a sanctuary to worship\r\nher, and then discovered that the doll was filled with sawdust he could\r\nneither forgive himself nor her. His soul was lacerated. It was all\r\nmake-believe that he had lived on, and when the truth shattered it he\r\nthought reality itself was shattered. It was true enough, he would not\r\nforgive her because he could not forgive himself.\r\n\r\nShe thought that she heard him give a faint sigh and she shot a rapid\r\nglance at him. A sudden thought struck her and it took her breath away.\r\nShe only just refrained from giving a cry.\r\n\r\nWas it what they called--a broken heart--that he suffered from?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xlviii_\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the next day Kitty thought of the convent; and the morning after,\r\nearly, soon after Walter had gone, taking the amah with her to get\r\nchairs, she crossed the river. It was barely day and the Chinese\r\ncrowding the ferry boat, some in the blue cotton of the peasant, others\r\nin the black robes of respectability, had a strange look of the dead\r\nbeing borne over the water to the land of shadow. And when they stepped\r\nashore they stood for a little at the landing-place uncertainly as\r\nthough they did not quite know where to go, before desultorily, in twos\r\nand threes, they wandered up the hill.\r\n\r\nAt that hour the streets of the city were very empty so that more than\r\never it seemed a city of the dead. The passers-by had an abstracted air\r\nso that you might almost have thought them ghosts. The sky was unclouded\r\nand the early sun shed a heavenly mildness on the scene; it was\r\ndifficult to imagine, on that blithe, fresh and smiling morn, that the\r\ncity lay gasping, like a man whose life is being throttled out of him by\r\na maniac\'s hands, in the dark clutch of the pestilence. It was\r\nincredible that nature (the blue of the sky was clear like a child\'s\r\nheart) should be so indifferent when men were writhing in agony and\r\ngoing to their death in fear. When the chairs were set down at the\r\nconvent door a beggar arose from the ground and asked Kitty for alms. He\r\nwas clad in faded and shapeless rags that looked as though he had raked\r\nthem out of a muck-heap, and through their rents you saw his skin hard\r\nand rough and tanned like the hide of a goat; his bare legs were\r\nemaciated, and his head, with its shock of coarse grey hair (the cheeks\r\nhollow, the eyes wild), was the head of a madman. Kitty turned from him\r\nin frightened horror, and the chair-bearers in gruff tones bade him\r\nbegone, but he was importunate, and to be rid of him, shuddering, Kitty\r\ngave him a few cash.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened and the amah explained that Kitty wished to see the\r\nMother Superior. She was taken once more into the stiff parlour in which\r\nit seemed a window had never been opened, and here she sat so long that\r\nshe began to think her message had not been delivered. At last the\r\nMother Superior came in.\r\n\r\n"I must ask you to excuse me for keeping you waiting," she said. "I did\r\nnot expect you and I was occupied."\r\n\r\n"Forgive me for troubling you. I am afraid I have come at an\r\ninconvenient moment."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior gave her a smile, austere but sweet, and begged her\r\nto sit down. But Kitty saw that her eyes were swollen. She had been\r\nweeping. Kitty was startled, for she had received from the Mother\r\nSuperior the impression that she was a woman whom earthly troubles could\r\nnot greatly move.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid something has happened," she faltered. "Would you like me\r\nto go away? I can come another time."\r\n\r\n"No, no. Tell me what I can do for you. It is only--only that one of our\r\nSisters died last night." Her voice lost its even tone and her eyes\r\nfilled with tears. "It is wicked of me to grieve, for I know that her\r\ngood and simple soul has flown straight to Heaven; she was a saint; but\r\nit is difficult always to control one\'s weakness. I am afraid I am not\r\nalways very reasonable."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry, I\'m so dreadfully sorry," said Kitty.\r\n\r\nHer ready sympathy brought a sob into her voice.\r\n\r\n"She was one of the Sisters who came out from France with me ten years\r\nago. There are only three of us left now. I remember, we stood in a\r\nlittle group at the end of the boat (what do you call it, the bow?) and\r\nas we steamed out of the harbour at Marseilles and we saw the golden\r\nfigure of Saint-Marie la Grace, we said a prayer together. It had been\r\nmy greatest wish since I entered religion to be allowed to come to\r\nChina, but when I saw the land grow distant I could not prevent myself\r\nfrom weeping. I was their Superior; it was not a very good example I was\r\ngiving my daughters. And then Sister St. Francis Xavier--that is the\r\nname of the Sister who died last night--took my hand and told me not to\r\ngrieve; for wherever we were, she said, there was France and there was\r\nGod."\r\n\r\nThat severe and handsome face was distorted by the grief which human\r\nnature wrung from her and by the effort to restrain the tears which her\r\nreason and her faith refused. Kitty looked away. She felt that it was\r\nindecent to peer into that struggle.\r\n\r\n"I have been writing to her father. She, like me, was her mother\'s only\r\ndaughter. They were fisher folk in Brittany, and it will be hard for\r\nthem. Oh, when will this terrible epidemic cease? Two of our girls have\r\nbeen attacked this morning and nothing but a miracle can save them.\r\nThese Chinese have no resistance. The loss of Sister St. Francis is very\r\nsevere. There is so much to do and now fewer than ever to do it. We have\r\nSisters at our other houses in China who are eager to come, all our\r\nOrder, I think, would give anything in the world (only they have\r\nnothing) to come here; but it is almost certain death; and so long as we\r\ncan manage with the Sisters we have I am unwilling that others should\r\nbe sacrificed."\r\n\r\n"That encourages me, _ma m\xc3\xa8re_," said Kitty. "I have been feeling that\r\nI had come at a very unfortunate moment. You said the other day that\r\nthere was more work than the Sisters could do, and I was wondering if\r\nyou would allow me to come and help them. I do not mind what I do if I\r\ncan only be useful. I should be thankful if you just set me to scrub the\r\nfloors."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior gave an amused smile and Kitty was astonished at the\r\nmobile temperament which could so easily pass from mood to mood.\r\n\r\n"There is no need to scrub the floors. That is done after a fashion by\r\nthe orphans." She paused and looked kindly at Kitty. "My dear child, do\r\nyou not think that you have done enough in coming with your husband\r\nhere? That is more than many wives would have had the courage to do, and\r\nfor the rest how can you be better occupied than in giving him peace and\r\ncomfort when he comes home to you after the day\'s work? Believe me, he\r\nneeds then all your love and all your consideration."\r\n\r\nKitty could not easily meet the eyes which rested on her with a detached\r\nscrutiny and with an ironical kindliness.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing whatever to do from morning till night," said Kitty. "I\r\nfeel that there is so much to be done that I cannot bear to think that I\r\nam idle. I don\'t want to make a nuisance of myself, and I know that I\r\nhave no claim either on your kindness or on your time, but I mean what I\r\nsay and it would be a charity that you were doing me if you would let me\r\nbe of some help to you."\r\n\r\n"You do not look very strong. When you did us the pleasure of coming to\r\nsee us the day before yesterday it seemed to me that you were very pale.\r\nSister St. Joseph thought that perhaps you were going to have a baby."\r\n\r\n"No, no," cried Kitty, flushing to the roots of her hair.\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior gave a little, silvery laugh.\r\n\r\n"It is nothing to be ashamed of, my dear child, nor is there anything\r\nimprobable in the supposition. How long have you been married?"\r\n\r\n"I am pale because I am naturally pale, but I am very strong, and I\r\npromise you I am not afraid of work."\r\n\r\nNow the Superior was complete mistress of herself. She assumed\r\nunconsciously the air of authority which was habitual to her and she\r\nheld Kitty in an appraising scrutiny. Kitty felt unaccountably nervous.\r\n\r\n"Can you speak Chinese?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not," answered Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is a pity. I could have put you in charge of the elder girls.\r\nIt is very difficult just now, and I am afraid they will get--what do\r\nyou call? Out of hand?" she concluded with a tentative sound.\r\n\r\n"Could I not be of help to the Sisters in nursing? I am not at all\r\nafraid of the cholera. I could nurse the girls or the soldiers."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior, unsmiling now, a reflective look on her face, shook\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n"You do not know what the cholera is. It is a dreadful thing to see. The\r\nwork in the infirmary is done by soldiers and we need a Sister only to\r\nsupervise. And so far as the girls are concerned . . . no, no, I am\r\nsure your husband would not wish it; it is a terrible and frightening\r\nsight."\r\n\r\n"I should grow used to it."\r\n\r\n"No, it is out of the question. It is our business and our privilege to\r\ndo such things, but there is no call for you to do so."\r\n\r\n"You make me feel very useless and very helpless. It seems incredible\r\nthat there should be nothing that I can do."\r\n\r\n"Have you spoken to your husband of your wish?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior looked at her as though she were delving into the\r\nsecrets of her heart, but when she saw Kitty\'s anxious and appealing\r\nlook she gave a smile.\r\n\r\n"Of course you are a Protestant?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter. Dr. Watson, the missionary who died, was a\r\nProtestant and it made no difference. He was all that was most charming\r\nto us. We owe him a deep debt of gratitude."\r\n\r\nNow the flicker of a smile passed over Kitty\'s face, but she did not say\r\nanything. The Mother Superior seemed to reflect. She rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you. I think I can find something for you to do. It\r\nis true that now Sister St. Francis has been taken from us, it is\r\nimpossible for us to cope with the work. When will you be ready to\r\nstart?"\r\n\r\n"Now."\r\n\r\n"_\xc3\x80 la bonne heure._ I am content to hear you say that."\r\n\r\n"I promise you I will do my best. I am very grateful to you for the\r\nopportunity that you are giving me."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior opened the parlour door, but as she was going out\r\nshe hesitated. Once more she gave Kitty a long, searching and sagacious\r\nlook. Then she laid her hand gently on her arm.\r\n\r\n"You know, my dear child, that one cannot find peace in work or in\r\npleasure, in the world or in a convent, but only in one\'s soul."\r\n\r\nKitty gave a little start, but the Mother Superior passed swiftly out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_xlix_\r\n\r\n\r\nKitty found the work a refreshment to her spirit. She went to the\r\nconvent every morning soon after sunrise and did not return to the\r\nbungalow till the westering sun flooded the narrow river and its crowded\r\njunks with gold. The Mother Superior gave into her case the smaller\r\nchildren. Kitty\'s mother had brought to London from her native Liverpool\r\na practical sense of housewifery and Kitty, notwithstanding her air of\r\nfrivolity, had always had certain gifts to which she referred only in\r\nbantering tones. Thus she could cook quite well and she sewed\r\nbeautifully. When she disclosed this talent she was set to supervise the\r\nstitching and hemming of the younger girls. They knew a little French\r\nand every day she picked up a few words of Chinese so that it was not\r\ndifficult for her to manage. At other times she had to see that the\r\nsmallest children did not get into mischief; she had to dress and\r\nundress them and take care that they rested when rest was needed. There\r\nwere a good many babies and these were in charge of amahs, but she was\r\nbidden to keep an eye on them. None of the work was very important and\r\nshe would have liked to do something which was more arduous; but the\r\nMother Superior paid no attention to her entreaties and Kitty stood\r\nsufficiently in awe of her not to be importunate.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days she had to make something of an effort to\r\novercome the faint distaste she felt for these little girls, in their\r\nugly uniforms, with their stiff black hair, their round yellow faces,\r\nand their staring, sloe-black eyes. But she remembered the soft look\r\nwhich had transfigured so beautifully the countenance of the Mother\r\nSuperior when on Kitty\'s first visit to the convent she had stood\r\nsurrounded by those ugly little things, and she would not allow herself\r\nto surrender to her instinct. And presently, taking in her arms one or\r\nother of the tiny creatures, crying because of a fall or a cutting\r\ntooth, when Kitty found that a few soft words, though in a language the\r\nchild could not understand, the pressure of her arms and the softness of\r\nher cheek against the weeping yellow face, could comfort and console,\r\nshe began to lose all her feeling of strangeness. The small children,\r\nwithout any fear of her, came to her in their childish troubles and it\r\ngave her a peculiar happiness to discern their confidence. It was the\r\nsame with the older girls, those to whom she taught sewing; their\r\nbright, clever smiles and the pleasure she could give them by a word of\r\npraise, touched her. She felt that they liked her and, flattered and\r\nproud, she liked them in return.\r\n\r\nBut there was one child that she could not grow used to. It was a little\r\ngirl of six, an idiot with a huge hydrocephalic head that swayed\r\ntop-heavily on a small, squat body, large vacant eyes and a drooling\r\nmouth; the creature spoke hoarsely a few mumbled words; it was revolting\r\nand horrible; and for some reason it conceived an idiot attachment for\r\nKitty so that it followed her about as she changed her place from one\r\npart of the large room to another. It clung to her skirt and rubbed its\r\nface against her knees. It sought to fondle her hands. She shivered with\r\ndisgust. She knew it yearned for caresses and she could not bring\r\nherself to touch it.\r\n\r\nOnce, speaking of it to Sister St. Joseph, she said that it was a pity\r\nit lived. Sister St. Joseph smiled and stretched out her hand to the\r\nmisformed thing. It came and rubbed its bulging forehead against it.\r\n\r\n"Poor little mite," said the nun. "She was brought here positively\r\ndying. By the mercy of Providence I was at the door just as she came. I\r\nthought there was not a moment to lose, so I baptized her at once. You\r\nwould not believe what trouble we have had to keep her with us. Three or\r\nfour times we thought that her little soul would escape to Heaven."\r\n\r\nKitty was silent. Sister St. Joseph in her loquacious way began to\r\ngossip of other things. And next day when the idiot child came to her\r\nand touched her hand Kitty nerved herself to place it in a caress on the\r\ngreat bare skull. She forced her lips into a smile. But suddenly the\r\nchild, with an idiot perversity, left her; it seemed to lose interest in\r\nher, and that day and the following days paid her no attention. Kitty\r\ndid not know what she had done and tried to lure it to her with smiles\r\nand gestures, but it turned away and pretended not to see her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_l_\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the nuns were busy from morning till night with a hundred duties\r\nKitty saw little of them but at the services in the bare, humble chapel.\r\nOn her first day the Mother Superior, catching sight of her seated at\r\nthe back behind the girls on the benches according to their ages,\r\nstopped and spoke to her.\r\n\r\n"You must not think it necessary for you to come to the chapel when we\r\ndo," she said. "You are a Protestant and you have your own convictions."\r\n\r\n"But I like to come, Mother. I find that it rests me."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior gave her a moment\'s glance and slightly inclined her\r\ngrave head.\r\n\r\n"Of course you will do exactly as you choose. I merely wanted you to\r\nunderstand that you are under no obligation."\r\n\r\nBut with Sister St. Joseph Kitty soon became on terms not of intimacy\r\nperhaps but of familiarity. The economy of the convent was in her charge\r\nand to look after the material well-being of that big family kept the\r\nSister on her feet all day. She said that the only time she had to rest\r\nwas that which she devoted to prayer. But it pleased her towards evening\r\nwhen Kitty was with the girls at their work to come in and, vowing that\r\nshe was tired out and had not a moment to spare, sit down for a few\r\nminutes and gossip. When she was not in the presence of the Mother\r\nSuperior she was a talkative, merry creature, fond of a joke, and she\r\ndid not dislike a bit of scandal. Kitty stood in no fear of her, her\r\nhabit did not prevent Sister St. Joseph from being a good-natured,\r\nhomely woman, and she chattered with her gaily. She did not mind with\r\nher showing how badly she talked French and they laughed with one\r\nanother over Kitty\'s mistakes. The Sister taught her every day a few\r\nuseful words of Chinese. She was a farmer\'s daughter and at heart she\r\nwas still a peasant.\r\n\r\n"I used to keep the cows when I was little," she said, "like St. Joan of\r\nArc. But I was too wicked to have visions. It was fortunate, I think,\r\nfor my father would certainly have whipped me if I had. He used often to\r\nwhip me, the good old man, for I was a very naughty little girl. I am\r\nashamed sometimes when I think now of the pranks I used to play."\r\n\r\nKitty laughed at the thought that this corpulent, middle-aged nun could\r\never have been a wayward child. And yet there was something childlike in\r\nher still so that your heart went out to her: she seemed to have about\r\nher an aroma of the countryside in autumn when the apple trees are laden\r\nwith fruit and the crops are in and safely housed. She had not the\r\ntragic and austere saintliness of the Mother Superior, but a gaiety that\r\nwas simple and happy.\r\n\r\n"Do you never wish to go home again, _ma s\xc5\x93ur_?" asked Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. It would be too hard to come back. I love to be here and I am\r\nnever so happy as when I am among the orphans. They\'re so good, they\'re\r\nso grateful. But it is all very well to be a nun (_on a beau \xc3\xaatre\r\nreligieuse_) still one has a mother and one cannot forget that one drank\r\nthe milk of her breasts. She is old, my mother, and it is hard never to\r\nsee her again; but then she is fond of her daughter-in-law, and my\r\nbrother is good to her. His son is growing up now, I should think they\r\nwill be glad of an extra pair of strong arms on the farm; he was only a\r\nchild when I left France, but he promised to have a fist that you could\r\nfell an ox with."\r\n\r\nIt was almost impossible in that quiet room, listening to the nun, to\r\nrealise that on the other side of these four walls cholera was raging.\r\nSister St. Joseph had an unconcern which conveyed itself to Kitty.\r\n\r\nShe had a na\xc3\xafve curiosity about the world and its inhabitants. She\r\nasked Kitty all kinds of questions about London and England, a country,\r\nshe thought, where so thick was the fog that you could not see your hand\r\nat midday, and she wanted to know if Kitty went to balls and whether she\r\nlived in a grand house and how many brothers and sisters she had. She\r\nspoke often of Walter. The Mother Superior said he was wonderful and\r\nevery day they prayed for him. How lucky Kitty was to have a husband who\r\nwas so good and so brave and so clever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_li_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut sooner or later Sister St. Joseph returned to the subject of the\r\nMother Superior. Kitty had been conscious from the beginning that the\r\npersonality of this woman dominated the convent. She was regarded by all\r\nthat dwelt there with love certainly and with admiration, but also with\r\nawe and not a little dread. Notwithstanding her kindliness Kitty herself\r\nfelt like a schoolgirl in her presence. She was never quite at her ease\r\nwith her, for she was filled with a sentiment which was so strange that\r\nit embarrassed her: reverence. Sister St. Joseph with an ingenious\r\ndesire to impress, told Kitty how great the family was to which the\r\nMother Superior belonged; she had among her ancestors persons of\r\nhistoric importance and she was _un peu cousine_ with half the kings in\r\nEurope: Alphonso of Spain had hunted at her father\'s, and they had\r\nch\xc3\xa2teaux all over France. It must have been hard to leave so much\r\ngrandeur. Kitty listened smilingly, but not a little impressed.\r\n\r\n"_Du reste_, you have only to look at her," said the Sister, "to see\r\nthat, _comme famille, c\'est le dessus du panier._"\r\n\r\n"She has the most beautiful hands that I have ever seen," said Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but if you only knew how she had used them. She is not afraid of\r\nwork, _notre bonne m\xc3\xa8re._"\r\n\r\nWhen they had come to this city there had been nothing. They had built\r\nthe convent. The Mother Superior had made the plans and supervised the\r\nwork. The moment they arrived they began to save the poor little\r\nunwanted girls from the baby-tower and the cruel hands of the midwife.\r\nAt first they had had no beds to sleep in and no glass to keep out the\r\nnight air ("and there is nothing," said Sister St. Joseph, "which is\r\nmore unwholesome"); and often they had no money left, not only to pay\r\nthe builders, but even to buy their simple fare; they lived like\r\npeasants, what was she saying? the peasants in France, _tenez_, the men\r\nwho worked for her father, would have thrown to the pigs the food they\r\nate. And then the Mother Superior would collect her daughters round her\r\nand they would kneel and pray; and the Blessed Virgin would send money.\r\nA thousand francs would arrive by post next day, or a stranger, an\r\nEnglishman (a Protestant, if you please) or even a Chinaman would knock\r\nat the door while they were actually on their knees and bring them a\r\npresent. Once they were in such straits that they all made a vow to the\r\nBlessed Virgin that they would recite a _neuvaine_ in her honour if she\r\nsuccoured them, and, would you believe it? that funny Mr. Waddington\r\ncame to see us next day and saying that we looked as though we all\r\nwanted a good plate of roast beef gave us a hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nWhat a comic little man he was, with his bald head and his little shrewd\r\neyes (_ses petits yeux malins_) and his jokes. _Mon Dieu_, how he\r\nmurdered the French language, and yet you could not help laughing at\r\nhim. He was always in a good humour. All through this terrible epidemic\r\nhe carried himself as if he were enjoying a holiday. He had a heart\r\nquite French and a wit so that you would hardly believe he was English.\r\nExcept for his accent. But sometimes Sister St. Joseph thought he spoke\r\nbadly on purpose to make you laugh. Of course his morals were not all\r\none could wish; but still that was his business (with a sigh, a shrug\r\nand a shake of the head) and he was a bachelor and a young man.\r\n\r\n"What is wrong with his morals, ma s\xc5\x93ur?" asked Kitty smiling.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that you do not know? It is a sin for me to tell you. I\r\nhave no business to say such things. He lives with a Chinese woman, that\r\nis to say, not a Chinese woman, but a Manchu. A princess, it appears,\r\nand she loves him to distraction."\r\n\r\n"That sounds quite impossible," cried Kitty.\r\n\r\n"No, no, I promise you, it is everything that is most true. It is very\r\nwicked of him. Those things are not done. Did you not hear, when you\r\nfirst came to the convent and he would not eat the _madeleines_ that I\r\nhad made expressly, that _notre bonne m\xc3\xa8re_ said his stomach was\r\nderanged by Manchu cooking? That was what she meant and you should have\r\nseen the head that he made. It is a story altogether curious. It appears\r\nthat he was stationed at Hankow during the revolution when they were\r\nmassacring the Manchus and this good little Waddington saved the lives\r\nof one of their great families. They are related to the Imperial Family.\r\nThe girl fell violently in love with him and--well, the rest you can\r\nimagine. And then when he left Hankow she ran away and followed him and\r\nnow she follows him everywhere, and he has had to resign himself to keep\r\nher, poor fellow, and I daresay he is very fond of her; they are quite\r\ncharming sometimes, these Manchu women. But what am I thinking of? I\r\nhave a thousand things to do and I sit here. I am a bad religious. I am\r\nashamed of myself."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lii_\r\n\r\n\r\nKitty had a queer feeling that she was growing. The constant occupation\r\ndistracted her mind and the glimpses she had of other lives and other\r\noutlooks awakened her imagination. She began to regain her spirits; she\r\nfelt better and stronger. It had seemed to her that she could do nothing\r\nnow but weep; but to her surprise, and not a little to her confusion,\r\nshe caught herself laughing at this and that. It began to seem quite\r\nnatural to live in the midst of a terrible epidemic. She knew that\r\npeople were dying to the right and left of her, but she ceased very much\r\nto think of it. The Mother Superior had forbidden her to go into the\r\ninfirmaries and the closed doors excited her curiosity. She would have\r\nliked to peep in, but could not do so without being seen, and she did\r\nnot know what punishment the Mother Superior would inflict upon her. It\r\nwould be dreadful to be sent away. She was devoted to the children now\r\nand they would miss her if she went; in fact she did not know what they\r\nwould do without her.\r\n\r\nAnd one day it occurred to her that she had neither thought of Charles\r\nTownsend nor dreamt of him for a week. Her heart gave a sudden thud\r\nagainst her ribs: she was cured. She could think of him now with\r\nindifference. She loved him no longer. Oh, the relief and the sense of\r\nliberation! It was strange to look back and remember how passionately\r\nshe had yearned for him; she thought she would die when he failed her;\r\nshe thought life thenceforward had nothing to offer but misery. And now\r\nalready she was laughing. A worthless creature. What a fool she had made\r\nof herself! And now, considering him calmly, she wondered what on earth\r\nshe had seen in him. It was lucky that Waddington knew nothing, she\r\ncould never have endured his malicious eyeing and his ironical\r\ninnuendoes. She was free, free at last, free! She could hardly prevent\r\nherself from laughing aloud.\r\n\r\nThe children were playing some romping game and it was her habit to look\r\non with an indulgent smile, restraining them when they made too much\r\nnoise and taking care that in their boisterousness none was hurt; but\r\nnow in her high spirits, feeling as young as any of them, she joined in\r\nthe game. The little girls received her with delight. They chased up and\r\ndown the room, shouting at the top of their shrill voices, with\r\nfantastic and almost barbarous glee. They grew so excited that they\r\nleaped into the air with joy. The noise was terrific.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened and the Mother Superior stood on the threshold.\r\nKitty, abashed, extricated herself from the clutches of a dozen little\r\ngirls who with wild shrieks had seized her.\r\n\r\n"Is this how you keep these children good and quiet?" asked the Mother\r\nSuperior, a smile on her lips.\r\n\r\n"We were having a game, Mother. They got excited. It is my fault, I led\r\nthem on."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior came forward and as usual the children clustered\r\nabout her. She put her hands round their narrow shoulders and playfully\r\npulled their little yellow ears. She looked at Kitty with a long, soft\r\nlook. Kitty was flushed and she was breathing quickly. Her liquid eyes\r\nwere shining and her lovely hair, disarranged in all the struggling and\r\nthe laughter, was in adorable confusion.\r\n\r\n"_Que vous \xc3\xaates belle, ma ch\xc3\xa8re enfant_," said the Mother Superior.\r\n"It does the heart good to look at you. No wonder these children adore\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nKitty blushed deeply and, she knew not why, tears suddenly filled her\r\neyes. She covered her face with her hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mother, you make me ashamed."\r\n\r\n"Come, do not be silly. Beauty is also a gift of God, one of the most\r\nrare and precious, and we should be thankful if we are happy enough to\r\npossess it and thankful, if we are not, that others possess it for our\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\nShe smiled again and as though Kitty were a child too gently patted her\r\nsoft cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_liii_\r\n\r\n\r\nSince she had been working at the convent Kitty had seen less of\r\nWaddington. Two or three times he had come down to the river bank to\r\nmeet her and they had walked up the hill together. He came in to drink a\r\nwhisky and soda, but he would seldom stay to dinner. One Sunday,\r\nhowever, he suggested that they should take their luncheon with them and\r\ngo in chairs to a Buddhist monastery. It was situated ten miles from the\r\ncity and had some reputation as a place of pilgrimage. The Mother\r\nSuperior, insisting that Kitty must have a day\'s rest, would not let her\r\nwork on Sundays and Walter of course was as busy then as usual.\r\n\r\nThey started early in order to arrive before the heat of the day and\r\nwere carried along a narrow causeway between the rice fields. Now and\r\nthen they passed comfortable farm-houses nestling with friendly intimacy\r\nin a grove of bamboos. Kitty enjoyed the idleness; it was pleasant after\r\nbeing cooped up in the city to see about her the wide country. They came\r\nto the monastery, straggling low buildings by the side of the river,\r\nagreeably shaded by trees, and were led by smiling monks through\r\ncourtyards, empty with a solemn emptiness, and shown temples with\r\ngrimacing gods. In the sanctuary sat the Buddha, remote and sad,\r\nwistful, abstracted and faintly smiling. There was about everything a\r\nsense of dejection; the magnificence was shoddy and ruined; the gods\r\nwere dusty and the faith that had made them was dying. The monks seemed\r\nto stay on sufference, as though they awaited a notice to quit; and in\r\nthe smile of the abbot, with his beautiful politeness, was the irony of\r\nresignation. One of these days the monks would wander away from the\r\nshady, pleasant wood, and the buildings, crumbling and neglected, would\r\nbe battered by fierce storms and besieged by the surrounding nature.\r\nWild creepers would twine themselves about the dead images and trees\r\nwould grow in the courtyards. Then the gods would dwell there no longer,\r\nbut evil spirits of darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_liv_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey sat on the steps of a little building (four lacquered columns and a\r\nhigh, tiled roof under which stood a great bronze bell) and watched the\r\nriver flow sluggish and with many a bend towards the stricken city. They\r\ncould see its crenellated walls. The heat hung over it like a pall. But\r\nthe river, though it flowed so slowly, had still a sense of movement and\r\nit gave one a melancholy feeling of the transitoriness of things.\r\nEverything passed, and what trace of its passage remained? It seemed to\r\nKitty that they were all, the human race, like the drops of water in\r\nthat river and they flowed on, each so close to the other and yet so far\r\napart, a nameless flood, to the sea. When all things lasted so short a\r\ntime and nothing mattered very much, it seemed pitiful that men,\r\nattaching an absurd importance to trivial objects, should make\r\nthemselves and one another so unhappy.\r\n\r\n"Do you know Harrington Gardens?" she asked Waddington, with a smile in\r\nher beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n"No. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing; only it\'s a long way from here. It\'s where my people live."\r\n\r\n"Are you thinking of going home?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'ll be leaving here in a couple of months. The epidemic\r\nseems to be abating and the cool weather should see the end of it."\r\n\r\n"I almost think I shall be sorry to go."\r\n\r\nFor a moment she thought of the future. She did not know what plans\r\nWalter had in mind. He told her nothing. He was cool, polite, silent and\r\ninscrutable. Two little drops in that river that flowed silently towards\r\nthe unknown; two little drops that to themselves had so much\r\nindividuality and to the onlooker were but an undistinguishable part of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n"Take care the nuns don\'t start converting you," said Waddington, with\r\nhis malicious little smile.\r\n\r\n"They\'re much too busy. Nor do they care. They\'re wonderful and so kind;\r\nand yet--I hardly know how to explain it--there is a wall between them\r\nand me. I don\'t know what it is. It is as though they possessed a secret\r\nwhich made all the difference in their lives and which I was unworthy to\r\nshare. It is not faith; it is something deeper and more--more\r\nsignificant: they walk in a different world from ours and we shall\r\nalways be strangers to them. Each day when the convent door closes\r\nbehind me I feel that for them I have ceased to exist."\r\n\r\n"I can understand that it is something of a blow to your vanity," he\r\nreturned mockingly.\r\n\r\n"My vanity."\r\n\r\nKitty shrugged her shoulders. Then, smiling once more, she turned to him\r\nlazily.\r\n\r\n"Why did you never tell me that you lived with a Manchu princess?"\r\n\r\n"What have those gossiping old women been telling you? I am sure that it\r\nis a sin for nuns to discuss the private affairs of the Customs\r\nofficials."\r\n\r\n"Why should you be so sensitive?"\r\n\r\nWaddington glanced down, sideways, so that it gave him an air of\r\nshyness. He faintly shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a thing to advertise. I do not know that it would greatly add\r\nto my chances of promotion in the service."\r\n\r\n"Are you very fond of her?"\r\n\r\nHe looked up now and his ugly little face had the look of a naughty\r\nschoolboy\'s.\r\n\r\n"She\'s abandoned everything for my sake, home, family, security and\r\nself-respect. It\'s a good many years now since she threw everything to\r\nthe winds to be with me. I\'ve sent her away two or three times, but\r\nshe\'s always come back; I\'ve run away from her myself, but she\'s always\r\nfollowed me. And now I\'ve given it up as a bad job; I think I\'ve got to\r\nput up with her for the rest of my life."\r\n\r\n"She must really love you to distraction."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a rather funny sensation, you know," he answered, wrinkling a\r\nperplexed forehead. "I haven\'t the smallest doubt that if I really left\r\nher, definitely, she would commit suicide. Not with any ill-feeling\r\ntowards me, but quite naturally, because she was unwilling to live\r\nwithout me. It is a curious feeling it gives one to know that. It can\'t\r\nhelp meaning something to you."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s loving that\'s the important thing, not being loved. One\'s not\r\neven grateful to the people who love one; if one doesn\'t love them, they\r\nonly bore one."\r\n\r\n"I have no experience of the plural," he replied. "Mine is only in the\r\nsingular."\r\n\r\n"Is she really an Imperial Princess?"\r\n\r\n"No, that is a romantic exaggeration of the nuns. She belongs to one of\r\nthe great families of the Manchus, but they have, of course, been ruined\r\nby the revolution. She is all the same a very great lady."\r\n\r\nHe said it in a tone of pride, so that a smile flickered in Kitty\'s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to stay here for the rest of your life then?"\r\n\r\n"In China? Yes. What would she do elsewhere? When I retire I shall take\r\na little Chinese house in Peking and spend the rest of my days there."\r\n\r\n"Have you any children?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously. It was strange that this little bald-headed\r\nman with his monkey face should have aroused in the alien woman so\r\ndevastating a passion. She could not tell why the way he spoke of her,\r\nnotwithstanding his casual manner and his flippant phrases, gave her the\r\nimpression so strongly of the woman\'s intense and unique devotion. It\r\ntroubled her a little.\r\n\r\n"It does seem a long way to Harrington Gardens," she smiled.\r\n\r\n"Why do you say that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand anything. Life is so strange. I feel like someone\r\nwho\'s lived all his life by a duck-pond and suddenly is shown the sea.\r\nIt makes me a little breathless, and yet it fills me with elation. I\r\ndon\'t want to die, I want to live. I\'m beginning to feel a new courage.\r\nI feel like one of those old sailors who set sail for undiscovered seas\r\nand I think my soul hankers for the unknown."\r\n\r\nWaddington looked at her reflectively. Her abstracted gaze rested on the\r\nsmoothness of the river. Two little drops that flowed silently, silently\r\ntowards the dark, eternal sea.\r\n\r\n"May I come and see the Manchu lady?" asked Kitty, suddenly raising her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"She can\'t speak a word of English."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been very kind to me, you\'ve done a great deal for me, perhaps I\r\ncould show her by my manner that I had a friendly feeling towards her."\r\n\r\nWaddington gave a thin, mocking little smile, but he answered with good\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\n"I will come and fetch you one day and she shall give you a cup of\r\njasmine tea."\r\n\r\nShe would not tell him that this story of an alien love had from the\r\nfirst moment strangely intrigued her fancy, and the Manchu Princess\r\nstood now as the symbol of something that vaguely, but insistently,\r\nbeckoned to her. She pointed enigmatically to a mystic land of the\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lv_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a day or two later Kitty made an unforeseen discovery.\r\n\r\nShe went to the convent as usual and set about her first work of seeing\r\nthat the children were washed and dressed. Since the nuns held firmly\r\nthat the night air was harmful, the atmosphere in the dormitory was\r\nclose and fetid. After the freshness of the morning it always made Kitty\r\na little uncomfortable and she hastened to open such windows as would.\r\nBut to-day she felt on a sudden desperately sick and with her head\r\nswimming she stood at a window trying to compose herself. It had never\r\nbeen as bad as this before. Then nausea overwhelmed her and she vomited.\r\nShe gave a cry so that the children were frightened, and the older girl\r\nwho was helping her ran up and, seeing Kitty white and trembling,\r\nstopped short with an exclamation. Cholera! The thought flashed through\r\nKitty\'s mind and then a deathlike feeling came over her; she was seized\r\nwith terror, she struggled for a moment against the night that seemed\r\nagonisingly to run through her veins; she felt horribly ill; and then\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nWhen she opened her eyes she did not at first know where she was. She\r\nseemed to be lying on the floor and, moving her head slightly, she\r\nthought that there was a pillow under it. She could not remember. The\r\nMother Superior was kneeling by her side, holding smelling salts to her\r\nnose, and Sister St. Joseph stood looking at her. Then it came back.\r\nCholera! She saw the consternation on the nuns\' faces. Sister St. Joseph\r\nlooked huge and her outline was blurred. Once more terror overwhelmed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mother, Mother," she sobbed. "Am I going to die? I don\'t want to\r\ndie."\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'re not going to die," said the Mother Superior.\r\n\r\nShe was quite composed and there was even amusement in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s cholera. Where\'s Walter? Has he been sent for? Oh, Mother,\r\nMother."\r\n\r\nShe burst into a flood of tears. The Mother Superior gave her hand and\r\nKitty seized it as though it were a hold upon the life she feared to\r\nlose.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, my dear child, you mustn\'t be so silly. It\'s not cholera or\r\nanything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Walter?"\r\n\r\n"Your husband is much too busy to be troubled. In five minutes you\'ll be\r\nperfectly well."\r\n\r\nKitty looked at her with staring, harassed eyes. Why did she take it so\r\ncalmly? It was cruel.\r\n\r\n"Keep perfectly quiet for a minute," said the Mother Superior. "There is\r\nnothing to alarm yourself about."\r\n\r\nKitty felt her heart beat madly. She had grown so used to the thought of\r\ncholera that it had ceased to seem possible that she could catch it. Oh,\r\nthe fool she had been! She knew she was going to die. She was\r\nfrightened. The girls brought in a long rattan chair and placed it by\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n"Come, let us lift you," said the Mother Superior. "You will be more\r\ncomfortable on the _chaise longue_. Do you think you can stand?"\r\n\r\nShe put her hands under Kitty\'s arms and Sister St. Joseph helped her to\r\nher feet. She sank exhausted into the chair.\r\n\r\n"I had better shut the window," said Sister St. Joseph. "The early\r\nmorning air cannot be good for her."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Kitty. "Please leave it open."\r\n\r\nIt gave her confidence to see the blue sky. She was shaken, but\r\ncertainly she began to feel better. The two nuns looked at her for a\r\nmoment in silence, and Sister St. Joseph said something to the Mother\r\nSuperior which she could not understand. Then the Mother Superior sat on\r\nthe side of the chair and took her hand.\r\n\r\n"Listen, _ma ch\xc3\xa8re enfant_ . . ."\r\n\r\nShe asked her one or two questions. Kitty answered them without knowing\r\nwhat they meant. Her lips were trembling so that she could hardly frame\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt about it," said Sister St. Joseph. "I am not one to\r\nbe deceived in such a matter."\r\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh in which Kitty seemed to discern a certain\r\nexcitement and not a little affection. The Mother Superior, still\r\nholding Kitty\'s hand, smiled with soft tenderness.\r\n\r\n"Sister St. Joseph has more experience of these things than I have, dear\r\nchild, and she said at once what was the matter with you. She was\r\nevidently quite right."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked Kitty anxiously.\r\n\r\n"It is quite evident. Did the possibility of such a thing never occur to\r\nyou? You are with child, my dear."\r\n\r\nThe start that Kitty gave shook her from head to foot, and she put her\r\nfeet to the ground as though to spring up.\r\n\r\n"Lie still, lie still," said the Mother Superior.\r\n\r\nKitty felt herself blush furiously and she put her hands to her breasts.\r\n\r\n"It\'s impossible. It isn\'t true."\r\n\r\n"_Qu\'est ce qu\'elle dit?_" asked Sister St. Joseph.\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior translated. Sister St. Joseph\'s broad simple face,\r\nwith its red cheeks, was beaming.\r\n\r\n"No mistake is possible. I give you my word of honour."\r\n\r\n"How long have you been married, my child?" asked the Mother Superior.\r\n"Why, when my sister-in-law had been married as long as you she had\r\nalready two babies."\r\n\r\nKitty sank back into the chair. There was death in her heart.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so ashamed," she whispered.\r\n\r\n"Because you are going to have a baby? Why, what can be more natural?"\r\n\r\n"_Quelle joie pour le docteur_," said Sister St. Joseph.\r\n\r\n"Yes, think what a happiness for your husband. He will be overwhelmed\r\nwith joy. You have only to see him with babies, and the look on his face\r\nwhen he plays with them, to see how enchanted he will be to have one of\r\nhis own."\r\n\r\nFor a little while Kitty was silent. The two nuns looked at her with\r\ntender interest and the Mother Superior stroked her hand.\r\n\r\n"It was silly of me not to have suspected it before," said Kitty. "At\r\nall events I\'m glad it\'s not cholera. I feel very much better. I will\r\nget back to my work."\r\n\r\n"Not to-day, my dear child. You have had a shock, you had much better go\r\nhome and rest yourself."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I would much rather stay and work."\r\n\r\n"I insist. What would our good doctor say if I let you be imprudent?\r\nCome to-morrow, if you like, or the day after, but to-day you must be\r\nquiet. I will send for a chair. Would you like me to let one of our\r\nyoung girls go with you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I shall be all right alone."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lvi_\r\n\r\n\r\nKitty was lying on her bed and the shutters were closed. It was after\r\nluncheon and the servants slept. What she had learnt that morning (and\r\nnow she was certain that it was true) filled her with consternation.\r\nEver since she came home she had been trying to think; but her mind was\r\na blank, and she could not collect her thoughts. Suddenly she heard a\r\nstep, the feet were booted so that it could not be one of the boys; with\r\na gasp of apprehension she realised that it could only be her husband.\r\nHe was in the sitting-room and she heard herself called. She did not\r\nreply. There was a moment\'s silence and then a knock on her door.\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"May I come in?"\r\n\r\nKitty rose from her bed and slipped into a dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nHe entered. She was glad that the closed shutters shadowed her face.\r\n\r\n"I hope I didn\'t wake you. I knocked very, very gently."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been asleep."\r\n\r\nHe went to one of the windows and threw open the shutter. A flood of\r\nwarm light streamed into the room.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she asked. "Why are you back so early?"\r\n\r\n"The Sisters said that you weren\'t very well. I thought I had better\r\ncome and see what was the matter."\r\n\r\nA flash of anger passed through her.\r\n\r\n"What would you have said if it had been cholera?"\r\n\r\n"If it had been you certainly couldn\'t have made your way home this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nShe went to the dressing-table and passed the comb through her shingled\r\nhair. She wanted to gain time. Then, sitting down, she lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t very well this morning and the Mother Superior thought I\'d\r\nbetter come back here. But I\'m perfectly all right again. I shall go to\r\nthe convent as usual to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"What was the matter with you?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t they tell you?"\r\n\r\n"No. The Mother Superior said that you must tell me yourself."\r\n\r\nHe did now what he did seldom; he looked her full in the face; his\r\nprofessional instincts were stronger than his personal. She hesitated.\r\nThen she forced herself to meet his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to have a baby," she said.\r\n\r\nShe was accustomed to his habit of meeting with silence a statement\r\nwhich you would naturally expect to evoke an exclamation, but never had\r\nit seemed to her more devastating. He said nothing; he made no gesture;\r\nno movement on his face nor change of expression in his dark eyes\r\nindicated that he had heard. She felt suddenly inclined to cry. If a man\r\nloved his wife and his wife loved him, at such a moment they were drawn\r\ntogether by a poignant emotion. The silence was intolerable and she\r\nbroke it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why it never occurred to me before. It was stupid of me,\r\nbut . . . what with one thing and another . . ."\r\n\r\n"How long have you . . . when do you expect to be confined?"\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to issue from his lips with difficulty. She felt that\r\nhis throat was as dry as hers. It was a nuisance that her lips trembled\r\nso when she spoke; if he was not of stone it must excite his pity.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'ve been like this between two and three months."\r\n\r\n"Am I the father?"\r\n\r\nShe gave a little gasp. There was just a shadow of a tremor in his\r\nvoice; it was dreadful that cold self-control of his which made the\r\nsmallest token of emotion so shattering. She did not know why she\r\nthought suddenly of an instrument she had been shown in Tching-Yen upon\r\nwhich a needle oscillated a little and she had been told that this\r\nrepresented an earthquake a thousand miles away in which perhaps a\r\nthousand persons had lost their lives. She looked at him. He was ghastly\r\npale. She had seen that pallor on him once, twice before. He was looking\r\ndown, a little sideways.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands. She knew that if she could say yes it would mean\r\neverything in the world to him. He would believe her, of course he would\r\nbelieve her, because he wanted to; and then he would forgive. She knew\r\nhow deep was his tenderness and how ready he was, for all his shyness,\r\nto expend it. She knew that he was not vindictive; he would forgive her\r\nif she could but give him an excuse to, an excuse that touched his\r\nheart, and he would forgive completely. She could count on him never to\r\nthrow the past in her teeth. Cruel he might be, cold and morbid, but he\r\nwas neither mean nor petty. It would alter everything if she said yes.\r\n\r\nAnd she had an urgent need for sympathy. The unexpected knowledge that\r\nshe was with child had overwhelmed her with strange hopes and unforeseen\r\ndesires. She felt weak, frightened a little, alone and very far from any\r\nfriends. That morning, though she cared little for her mother, she had\r\nhad a sudden craving to be with her. She needed help and consolation.\r\nShe did not love Walter, she knew that she never could, but at this\r\nmoment she longed with all her heart for him to take her in his arms so\r\nthat she could lay her head on his breast; clinging to him she could\r\nhave cried happily; she wanted him to kiss her and she wanted to twine\r\nher arms around his neck.\r\n\r\nShe began to weep. She had lied so much and she could lie so easily.\r\nWhat could a lie matter when it could only do good? A lie, a lie, what\r\nwas a lie? It was so easy to say yes. She saw Walter\'s eyes melt and his\r\narms outstretched towards her. She couldn\'t say it; she didn\'t know why,\r\nshe just couldn\'t. All she had gone through during these bitter weeks,\r\nCharlie and his unkindness, the cholera and all these people dying, the\r\nnuns, oddly enough even that funny, drunken little Waddington, it all\r\nseemed to have changed her so that she did not know herself; though she\r\nwas so deeply moved, some bystander in her soul seemed to watch her with\r\nterror and surprise. She _had_ to tell the truth. It did not seem worth\r\nwhile to lie. Her thoughts wandered strangely: on a sudden she saw that\r\ndead beggar at the foot of the compound wall. Why should she think of\r\nhim? She did not sob; the tears streamed down her face, quite easily,\r\nfrom wide eyes. At last she answered the question. He had asked her if\r\nhe was the child\'s father.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she said.\r\n\r\nHe gave the ghost of a chuckle. It made Kitty shudder.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bit awkward, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nHis answer was characteristic, it was exactly what she would have\r\nexpected him to say, but it made her heart sink. She wondered if he\r\nrealised how hard it had been for her to tell the truth (at the same\r\nmoment she recognised that it had not been in the least hard, but\r\ninevitable) and if he gave her credit for it. Her answer, _I don\'t know,\r\nI don\'t know_, hammered away in her head. It was impossible now to take\r\nit back. She got her handkerchief from her bag and dried her eyes. They\r\ndid not speak. There was a syphon on the table by her bed and he got her\r\na glass of water. He brought it to her and held the glass while she\r\ndrank. She noticed how thin his hand was, it was a fine hand, slender,\r\nwith long fingers, but now it was nothing but skin and bone; it trembled\r\na little: he could control his face, but his hand betrayed him.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind my crying," she said. "It\'s nothing really; it\'s only that I\r\ncan\'t help the water running out of my eyes."\r\n\r\nShe drank the water and he put the glass back. He sat down on a chair\r\nand lit a cigarette. He gave a little sigh. Once or twice before she had\r\nheard him sigh like that and it always gave her a catch at the heart.\r\nLooking at him now, for he was staring with abstracted gaze out of the\r\nwindow, she was surprised that she had not noticed before how terribly\r\nthin he had grown during the last weeks. His temples were sunken and the\r\nbones of his face showed through the skin. His clothes hung on him\r\nloosely as though they had been made for a larger man. Through his\r\nsunburn his face had a greenish pallor. He looked exhausted. He was\r\nworking too hard, sleeping little and eating nothing. In her own grief\r\nand perturbation she found room to pity him. It was cruel to think that\r\nshe could do nothing for him.\r\n\r\nHe put his hand over his forehead, as though his head were aching, and\r\nshe had a feeling that in his brain too those words hammered madly: _I\r\ndon\'t know, I don\'t know._ It was strange that this moody, cold and shy\r\nman should have such a natural affection for very little babies; most\r\nmen didn\'t care much even for their own, but the nuns, touched and a\r\nlittle amused, had more than once spoken of it. If he felt like that\r\nabout those funny little Chinese babies what would he have felt about\r\nhis own? Kitty bit her lips in order to prevent herself from crying\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I must go back to the city. I have a great deal to do\r\nto-day. . . . Shall you be all right?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Don\'t bother about me."\r\n\r\n"I think you\'d better not wait for me this evening. I may be very late\r\nand I\'ll get something to eat from Colonel Y\xc3\xbc."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\nHe rose.\r\n\r\n"If I were you, I wouldn\'t try to do anything to-day. You\'d better take\r\nit easy. Is there anything you want before I go?"\r\n\r\n"No, thanks. I shall be quite all right."\r\n\r\nHe paused for an instant, as though he were undecided, and then,\r\nabruptly and without looking at her, took his hat and walked out of the\r\nroom. She heard him go through the compound. She felt terribly alone.\r\nThere was no need for self-restraint now and she gave herself up to a\r\npassion of tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lvii_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was sultry and Kitty sat at the window looking at the\r\nfantastic roofs, dark against the starlight, of the Chinese temple, when\r\nat last Walter came in. Her eyes were heavy with weeping, but she was\r\ncomposed. Notwithstanding all there was to harass her she felt, perhaps\r\nonly from exhaustion, strangely at peace.\r\n\r\n"I thought you\'d be already in bed," said Walter as he came in.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t sleepy. I thought it cooler to sit up. Have you had any\r\ndinner?"\r\n\r\n"All I want."\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down the long room and she saw that he had something to\r\nsay to her. She knew that he was embarrassed. Without concern she waited\r\nfor him to summon up his resolution. He began abruptly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been thinking about what you told me this afternoon. It seems to\r\nme that it would be better if you went away. I have spoken to Colonel\r\nY\xc3\xbc and he will give you an escort. You could take the amah with you.\r\nYou will be quite safe."\r\n\r\n"Where is there for me to go?"\r\n\r\n"You can go to your mother\'s."\r\n\r\n"Do you think she would be pleased to see me?"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, hesitating, as though for reflection.\r\n\r\n"Then you can go to Tching-Yen."\r\n\r\n"What should I do there?"\r\n\r\n"You will need a good deal of care and attention. I don\'t think it\'s\r\nfair to ask you to stay here."\r\n\r\nShe could not prevent the smile, not only of bitterness but of frank\r\namusement, that crossed her face. She gave him a glance and very nearly\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should be so anxious about my health."\r\n\r\nHe came over to the window and stood looking out at the night. There had\r\nnever been so many stars in the unclouded sky.\r\n\r\n"This isn\'t the place for a woman in your condition."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, white in his thin clothes against the darkness; there\r\nwas something sinister in his fine profile, and yet oddly enough at this\r\nmoment it excited in her no fear.\r\n\r\n"When you insisted on my coming here did you want it to kill me?" she\r\nasked suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe was so long answering that she thought he had refused to hear.\r\n\r\n"At first."\r\n\r\nShe gave a little shudder, for it was the first time he had admitted his\r\nintention. But she bore him no ill will for it. Her feeling surprised\r\nherself; there was a certain admiration in it and a faint amusement. She\r\ndid not quite know why, but suddenly thinking of Charlie Townsend he\r\nseemed to her an abject fool.\r\n\r\n"It was a terrible risk you were taking," she answered. "With your\r\nsensitive conscience I wonder if you could ever have forgiven yourself\r\nif I had died."\r\n\r\n"Well, you haven\'t. You\'ve thrived on it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never felt better in my life."\r\n\r\nShe had an instinct to throw herself on the mercy of his humour. After\r\nall they had gone through, when they were living amid these scenes of\r\nhorror and desolation, it seemed inept to attach importance to the\r\nridiculous act of fornication. When death stood round the corner, taking\r\nlives like a gardener digging up potatoes, it was foolishness to care\r\nwhat dirty things this person or that did with his body. If she could\r\nonly make him realise how little Charlie meant to her, so that now\r\nalready she had difficulty in calling up his features to her\r\nimagination, and how entirely the love of him had passed out of her\r\nheart! Because she had no feeling for Townsend the various acts she had\r\ncommitted with him had lost their significance. She had regained her\r\nheart and what she had given of her body seemed not to matter a rap. She\r\nwas inclined to say to Walter: "Look here, don\'t you think we\'ve been\r\nsilly long enough? We\'ve sulked with one another like children. Why\r\ncan\'t we kiss and be friends. There\'s no reason why we shouldn\'t be\r\nfriends just because we\'re not lovers."\r\n\r\nHe stood very still and the lamplight made the pallor of his impassive\r\nface startling. She did not trust him; if she said the wrong thing he\r\nwould turn upon her with such an icy sternness. She knew by now his\r\nextreme sensitiveness, for which his acid irony was a protection, and\r\nhow quickly he could close his heart if his feelings were hurt. She had\r\na moment\'s irritation at his stupidity. Surely what troubled him most\r\nwas the wound to his vanity: she vaguely realised that this is the\r\nhardest of all wounds to heal. It was singular that men attached so much\r\nimportance to their wives\' faithfulness; when first she had gone with\r\nCharlie she had expected to feel quite different, a changed woman; but\r\nshe had seemed to herself exactly the same, she had experienced only\r\nwellbeing and a greater vitality. She wished now that she had been able\r\nto tell Walter that the child was his; the lie would have meant so\r\nlittle to her, and the assurance would have been so great a comfort to\r\nhim. And after all it might not be a lie; it was funny, that something\r\nin her heart which had prevented her from giving herself the benefit of\r\nthe doubt. How silly men were! Their part in procreation was so\r\nunimportant; it was the woman who carried the child through long months\r\nof uneasiness and bore it with pain, and yet a man because of his\r\nmomentary connection made such preposterous claims. Why should that make\r\nany difference to him in his feeling towards the child? Then Kitty\'s\r\nthoughts wandered to the child which she herself would bear; she thought\r\nof it not with emotion nor with a passion of maternity, but with an idle\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n"I daresay you\'d like to think it over a little," said Walter, breaking\r\nthe long silence.\r\n\r\n"Think what?"\r\n\r\nHe turned a little as if he were surprised.\r\n\r\n"About when you want to go?"\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to go."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I like my work at the convent. I think I\'m making myself useful. I\r\nshould prefer to stay as long as you do."\r\n\r\n"I think I should tell you that in your present condition you are\r\nprobably more liable to catch any infection that happens to be about."\r\n\r\n"I like the discreet way you put it," she smiled ironically.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not staying for my sake?"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. He little knew that now the strongest emotion he excited\r\nin her, and the most unexpected, was pity.\r\n\r\n"No. You don\'t love me. I often think I rather bore you."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have thought you were the sort of person to put yourself\r\nout for a few stuffy nuns and a parcel of Chinese brats."\r\n\r\nHer lips outlined a smile.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s rather unfair to despise me so much because you made such\r\na mistake in your judgment of me. It\'s not my fault that you were such\r\nan ass."\r\n\r\n"If you\'re determined to stay you are of course at liberty to do so."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I can\'t give you the opportunity of being magnanimous." She\r\nfound it strangely hard to be quite serious with him. "As a matter of\r\nfact you\'re quite right, it\'s not only for the orphans that I\'m staying:\r\nyou see, I\'m in the peculiar position that I haven\'t got a soul in the\r\nworld that I can go to. I know no one who wouldn\'t think me a nuisance.\r\nI know no one who cares a row of pins if I\'m alive or dead."\r\n\r\nHe frowned. But he did not frown in anger.\r\n\r\n"We have made a dreadful hash of things, haven\'t we?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Do you still want to divorce me? I don\'t think I care any more."\r\n\r\n"You must know that by bringing you here I\'ve condoned the offence."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know. You see, I haven\'t made a study of infidelity. What are\r\nwe going to do then when we leave here? Are we going on living\r\ntogether?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t you think we can let the future take care of itself?"\r\n\r\nThere was the weariness of death in his voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lviii_\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo or three days later Waddington fetched Kitty from the convent (for\r\nher restlessness had induced her immediately to resume her work) and\r\ntook her to drink the promised cup of tea with his mistress. Kitty had\r\non more than one occasion dined at Waddington\'s house. It was a square,\r\nwhite and pretentious building, such as the Customs build for their\r\nofficials all over China; and the dining-room in which they ate, the\r\ndrawing-room in which they sat, were furnished with prim and solid\r\nfurniture. They had the appearance of being partly offices and partly\r\nhotel; there was nothing homelike in them and you understood that these\r\nhouses were merely places of haphazard sojourn to their successive\r\noccupants. It would never have occurred to you that on an upper floor\r\nmystery and perhaps romance dwelt shrouded. They ascended a flight of\r\nstairs and Waddington opened a door. Kitty went into a large, bare room\r\nwith white-washed walls on which hung scrolls in various calligraphies.\r\nAt a square table, on a stiff armchair, both of blackwood and heavily\r\ncarved, sat the Manchu. She rose as Kitty and Waddington entered, but\r\nmade no step forward.\r\n\r\n"Here she is," said Waddington, and added something in Chinese.\r\n\r\nKitty shook hands with her. She was slim in her long embroidered gown\r\nand somewhat taller than Kitty, used to the Southern people, had\r\nexpected. She wore a jacket of pale green silk with tight sleeves that\r\ncame over her wrists and on her black hair, elaborately dressed, was the\r\nhead-dress of the Manchu women. Her face was coated with powder and her\r\ncheeks from the eyes to the mouth heavily rouged; her plucked eyebrows\r\nwere a thin dark line and her mouth was scarlet. From this mask her\r\nblack, slightly slanting, large eyes burned like lakes of liquid jet.\r\nShe seemed more like an idol than a woman. Her movements were slow and\r\nassured. Kitty had the impression that she was slightly shy but very\r\ncurious. She nodded her head two or three times, looking at Kitty, while\r\nWaddington spoke of her. Kitty noticed her hands; they were\r\npreternaturally long, very slender, of the colour of ivory; and the\r\nexquisite nails were painted. Kitty thought she had never seen anything\r\nso lovely as those languid and elegant hands. They suggested the\r\nbreeding of uncounted centuries.\r\n\r\nShe spoke a little, in a high voice, like the twittering of birds in an\r\norchard, and Waddington, translating, told Kitty that she was glad to\r\nsee her; how old was she and how many children had she got? They sat\r\ndown on three straight chairs at the square table and a boy brought in\r\nbowls of tea, pale and scented with jasmine. The Manchu lady handed\r\nKitty a green tin of Three Castles cigarettes. Beside the table and the\r\nchairs the room contained little furniture; there was a wide pallet bed\r\non which was an embroidered head rest and two sandalwood chests.\r\n\r\n"What does she do with herself all day long?" asked Kitty.\r\n\r\n"She paints a little and sometimes she writes a poem. But she mostly\r\nsits. She smokes, but only in moderation, which is fortunate, since one\r\nof my duties is to prevent the traffic in opium."\r\n\r\n"Do you smoke?" asked Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Seldom. To tell you the truth I much prefer whisky."\r\n\r\nThere was in the room a faintly acrid smell; it was not unpleasant, but\r\npeculiar and exotic.\r\n\r\n"Tell her that I am sorry I cannot talk to her. I am sure we have many\r\nthings to say to one another."\r\n\r\nWhen this was translated to the Manchu she gave Kitty a quick glance in\r\nwhich there was the hint of a smile. She was impressive as she sat,\r\nwithout embarrassment, in her beautiful clothes; and from the painted\r\nface the eyes looked out wary, self-possessed and unfathomable. She was\r\nunreal, like a picture, and yet had an elegance which made Kitty feel\r\nall thumbs. Kitty had never paid anything but passing and somewhat\r\ncontemptuous attention to the China in which fate had thrown her. It was\r\nnot done in her set. Now she seemed on a sudden to have an inkling of\r\nsomething remote and mysterious. Here was the East, immemorial, dark and\r\ninscrutable. The beliefs and the ideals of the West seemed crude beside\r\nideals and beliefs of which in this exquisite creature she seemed to\r\ncatch a fugitive glimpse. Here was a different life, lived on a\r\ndifferent plane. Kitty felt strangely that the sight of this idol, with\r\nher painted face and slanting, wary eyes, made the efforts and the pains\r\nof the everyday world she knew slightly absurd. That coloured mask\r\nseemed to hide the secret of an abundant, profound and significant\r\nexperience: those long, delicate hands with their tapering fingers held\r\nthe key of riddles undivined.\r\n\r\n"What does she think about all day long?" asked Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," smiled Waddington.\r\n\r\n"She\'s wonderful. Tell her I\'ve never seen such beautiful hands. I\r\nwonder what she sees in _you_."\r\n\r\nWaddington, smiling, translated the question.\r\n\r\n"She says I\'m good."\r\n\r\n"As if a woman ever loved a man for his virtue," Kitty mocked.\r\n\r\nThe Manchu laughed but once. This was when Kitty, for something to say,\r\nexpressed admiration of a jade bracelet she wore. She took it off and\r\nKitty, trying to put it on, found, though her hands were small enough,\r\nthat it would not pass over her knuckles. Then the Manchu burst into\r\nchildlike laughter. She said something to Waddington and called for an\r\namah. She gave her an instruction and the amah in a moment brought in a\r\npair of very beautiful Manchu shoes.\r\n\r\n"She wants to give you these if you can wear them," said Waddington.\r\n"You\'ll find they make quite good bedroom slippers."\r\n\r\n"They fit me perfectly," said Kitty, not without satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut she noticed a roguish smile on Waddington\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Are they too big for her?" she asked quickly.\r\n\r\n"Miles."\r\n\r\nKitty laughed and when Waddington translated, the Manchu and the amah\r\nlaughed also.\r\n\r\nWhen Kitty and Waddington, a little later, were walking up the hill\r\ntogether, she turned to him with a friendly smile.\r\n\r\n"You did not tell me that you had a great affection for her."\r\n\r\n"What makes you think I have?"\r\n\r\n"I saw it in your eyes. It\'s strange, it must be like loving a phantom\r\nor a dream. Men are incalculable; I thought you were like everybody else\r\nand now I feel that I don\'t know the first thing about you."\r\n\r\nAs they reached the bungalow he asked her abruptly:\r\n\r\n"Why did you want to see her?"\r\n\r\nKitty hesitated for a moment before answering.\r\n\r\n"I\'m looking for something and I don\'t quite know what it is. But I know\r\nthat it\'s very important for me to know it, and if I did it would make\r\nall the difference. Perhaps the nuns know it; when I\'m with them I feel\r\nthat they hold a secret which they will not share with me. I don\'t know\r\nwhy it came into my head that if I saw this Manchu woman I should have\r\nan inkling of what I am looking for. Perhaps she would tell me if she\r\ncould."\r\n\r\n"What makes you think she knows it?"\r\n\r\nKitty gave him a sidelong glance, but did not answer. Instead she asked\r\nhim a question.\r\n\r\n"Do you know it?"\r\n\r\nHe smiled and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Tao. Some of us look for the Way in opium and some in God, some of us\r\nin whisky and some in love. It is all the same Way and it leads\r\nnowhither."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lix_\r\n\r\n\r\nKitty fell again into the comfortable routine of her work and though in\r\nthe early morning feeling far from well she had spirit enough not to let\r\nit discompose her. She was astonished at the interest the nuns took in\r\nher: sisters who, when she saw them in a corridor, had done no more than\r\nbid her good morning now on a flimsy pretext came into the room in which\r\nshe was occupied and looked at her, chatting a little, with a sweet and\r\nchildlike excitement. Sister St. Joseph told her with a repetition which\r\nwas sometimes tedious how she had been saying to herself for days past:\r\n"Now, I wonder," or: "I shouldn\'t be surprised"; and then, when Kitty\r\nfainted: "There can be no doubt, it jumps to the eyes." She told Kitty\r\nlong stories of her sister-in-law\'s confinements, which but for Kitty\'s\r\nquick sense of humour would have been not a little alarming. Sister St.\r\nJoseph combined in a pleasant fashion the realistic outlook of her\r\nupbringing (a river wound through the meadows of her father\'s farm and\r\nthe poplars that stood on its bank trembled in the faintest breeze) with\r\na charming intimacy with religious things. One day, firmly convinced\r\nthat a heretic could know nothing of such matters, she told Kitty of the\r\nAnnunciation.\r\n\r\n"I can never read those lines in the Holy Writ without weeping," she\r\nsaid. "I do not know why, but it gives me such a funny feeling."\r\n\r\nAnd then in French, in words that to Kitty sounded unfamiliar and in\r\ntheir precision a trifle cold, she quoted:\r\n\r\n"_And the angel came in unto her, and said. Hail full of grace, the Lord\r\nis with thee: blessed art thou among women._"\r\n\r\nThe mystery of birth blew through the convent like a little fitful wind\r\nplaying among the white blossoms of an orchard. The thought that Kitty\r\nwas with child disturbed and excited those sterile women. She frightened\r\nthem a little now and fascinated them. They looked upon the physical\r\nside of her condition with robust common sense, for they were the\r\ndaughters of peasants and fishermen; but in their childlike hearts was\r\nawe. They were troubled by the thought of her burden and yet happy and\r\nstrangely exalted. Sister St. Joseph told her that they all prayed for\r\nher, and Sister St. Martin had said what a pity it was she was not a\r\nCatholic; but the Mother Superior had reproved her; she said that it was\r\npossible to be a good woman--_une brave femme_, she put it--even though\r\none was Protestant and _le Bon Dieu_ would in some way or other arrange\r\nall that.\r\n\r\nKitty was both touched and diverted by the interest she aroused, but\r\nsurprised beyond measure when she found that even the Mother Superior,\r\nso austere in her saintliness, treated her with a new complaisance. She\r\nhad always been kind to Kitty, but in a remote fashion; now she used her\r\nwith a tenderness in which there was something maternal. Her voice had\r\nin it a new and gentle note and in her eyes was a sudden playfulness as\r\nthough Kitty were a child who had done a clever and amusing thing. It\r\nwas oddly moving. Her soul was like a calm, grey sea rolling\r\nmajestically, awe-inspiring in its sombre greatness, and then suddenly a\r\nray of sunshine made it alert, friendly and gay. Often now in the\r\nevening she would come and sit with Kitty.\r\n\r\n"I must take care that you do not tire yourself, _mon enfant_," she\r\nsaid, making a transparent excuse to herself, "or Dr. Fane will never\r\nforgive me. Oh, this British self-control! There he is delighted beyond\r\nmeasure and when you speak to him of it he becomes quite pale."\r\n\r\nShe took Kitty\'s hand and patted it affectionately.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Fane told me that he wished you to go away, but you would not\r\nbecause you could not bear to leave us. That was kind of you, my dear\r\nchild, and I want you to know that we appreciate the help you have been\r\nto us. But I think that you did not want to leave him either, and that\r\nis better, for your place is by his side, and he needs you. Ah, I do not\r\nknow what we should have done without that admirable man."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to think that he has been able to do something for you," said\r\nKitty.\r\n\r\n"You must love him with all your heart, my dear. He is a saint."\r\n\r\nKitty smiled and in her heart sighed. There was only one thing she could\r\ndo for Walter now and that she could not think how to. She wanted him to\r\nforgive her, not for her sake any more, but for his own; for she felt\r\nthat this alone could give him peace of mind. It was useless to ask him\r\nfor his forgiveness, and if he had a suspicion that she desired it for\r\nhis good rather than hers his stubborn vanity would make him refuse at\r\nall costs (it was curious that his vanity now did not irritate her, it\r\nseemed natural and only made her sorrier for him); and the only chance\r\nwas that some unexpected occurrence might throw him off his guard. She\r\nhad an idea that he would welcome an uprush of emotion which would\r\nliberate him from this nightmare of resentment, but that, in his\r\npathetic folly, he would fight when it came with all his might against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWas it not pitiful that men, tarrying so short a space in a world where\r\nthere was so much pain, should thus torture themselves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lx_\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the Mother Superior talked with Kitty not more than three or four\r\ntimes and once or twice but ten minutes the impression she made upon\r\nKitty was profound. Her character was like a country which on first\r\nacquaintance seems grand, but inhospitable; but in which presently you\r\ndiscover smiling little villages among fruit trees in the folds of the\r\nmajestic mountains, and pleasant ambling rivers that flow kindly through\r\nlush meadows. But these comfortable scenes, though they surprise and\r\neven reassure you, are not enough to make you feel at home in the land\r\nof tawny heights and windswept spaces. It would have been impossible to\r\nbecome intimate with the Mother Superior; she had that something\r\nimpersonal about her which Kitty had felt with the other nuns, even with\r\nthe good-humoured, chatty Sister St. Joseph, but with her it was a\r\nbarrier which was almost palpable. It gave you quite a curious\r\nsensation, chilling but awe-inspiring, that she could walk on the same\r\nearth as you, attend to mundane affairs, and yet live so obviously upon\r\na plane you could not reach. She once said to Kitty:\r\n\r\n"It is not enough that a religious should be continually in prayer with\r\nJesus; she should be herself a prayer."\r\n\r\nThough her conversation was interwoven with her religion, Kitty felt\r\nthat this was natural to her and that no effort was made to influence\r\nthe heretic. It seemed strange to her that the Mother Superior, with her\r\ndeep sense of charity, should be content to leave Kitty in a condition\r\nof what must seem to her sinful ignorance.\r\n\r\nOne evening the two of them were sitting together. The days were\r\nshortening now and the mellow light of the evening was agreeable and a\r\nlittle melancholy. The Mother Superior looked very tired. Her tragic\r\nface was drawn and white; her fine dark eyes had lost their fire. Her\r\nfatigue perhaps urged her to a rare mood of confidence.\r\n\r\n"This is a memorable day for me, my child," she said, breaking from a\r\nlong reverie, "for this is the anniversary of the day on which I finally\r\ndetermined to enter religion. For two years I had been thinking of it,\r\nbut I had suffered as it were a fear of this calling, for I dreaded that\r\nI might be recaptured by the spirit of the world. But that morning when\r\nI communicated I made the vow that I would before nightfall announce my\r\nwish to my dear mother. After I had received the Holy Communion I asked\r\nOur Lord to give me peace of mind: Thou shalt have it only, the answer\r\nseemed to come to me, when thou hast ceased to desire it."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior seemed to lose herself in thoughts of the past.\r\n\r\n"That day, one of our friends, Madame de Viernot, had left for the\r\nCarmel without telling any of her relatives. She knew that they were\r\nopposed to her step, but she was a widow and thought that as such she\r\nhad the right to do as she chose. One of my cousins had gone to bid\r\nfarewell to the dear fugitive and did not come back till the evening.\r\nShe was much moved. I had not spoken to my mother, I trembled at the\r\nthought of telling her what I had in mind, and yet I wished to keep the\r\nresolution I had made at Holy Communion. I asked my cousin all manner of\r\nquestions. My mother, who appeared to be absorbed in her tapestry, lost\r\nno word. While I talked I said to myself: If I want to speak to-day I\r\nhave not a minute to lose."\r\n\r\n"It is strange how vividly I remember the scene. We were sitting round\r\nthe table, a round table covered with a red cloth, and we worked by the\r\nlight of a lamp with a green shade. My two cousins were staying with us\r\nand we were all working at tapestries to re-cover the chairs in the\r\ndrawing-room. Imagine, they had not been recovered since the days of\r\nLouis XIV, when they were bought, and they were so shabby and faded, my\r\nmother said it was a disgrace."\r\n\r\n"I tried to form the words, but my lips would not move; and then,\r\nsuddenly, after a few minutes of silence my mother said to me: \'I really\r\ncannot understand the conduct of your friend. I do not like this leaving\r\nwithout a word all those to whom she is so dear. The gesture is\r\ntheatrical and offends my taste. A well-bred woman does nothing which\r\nshall make people talk of her. I hope that if ever you caused us the\r\ngreat sorrow of leaving us you would not take flight as though you were\r\ncommitting a crime.\'\r\n\r\n"It was the moment to speak, but such was my weakness that I could only\r\nsay: \'Ah, set your mind at rest, _maman_, I should not have the\r\nstrength.\'\r\n\r\n"My mother made no answer and I repented because I had not dared to\r\nexplain myself. I seemed to hear the word of Our Lord to St. Peter:\r\n\'Peter, lovest thou me?\' Oh, what weakness, what ingratitude was mine! I\r\nloved my comfort, the manner of my life, my family and my diversions. I\r\nwas lost in these bitter thoughts when a little later, as though the\r\nconversation had not been interrupted, my mother said to me: \'Still, my\r\nOdette, I do not think that you will die without having done something\r\nthat will endure.\'\r\n\r\n"I was still lost in my anxiety and my reflections, while my cousins,\r\nnever knowing the beating of my heart, worked quietly, when suddenly my\r\nmother, letting her tapestry fall and looking at me attentively, said:\r\n\'Ah, my dear child, I am very sure that you will end by becoming a\r\nreligious.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Are you speaking seriously, my good mother,\' I answered. \'You are\r\nlaying bare the innermost thought and desire of my heart.\'\r\n\r\n"\'_Mais oui_,\' cried my cousins without giving me time to finish, \'For\r\ntwo years Odette has thought of nothing else. But you will not give your\r\npermission, _ma tante_, you must not give your permission.\'\r\n\r\n"\'By what right, my dear children, should we refuse it,\' said my mother,\r\n\'if it is the Will of God?\'\r\n\r\n"My cousins then, wishing to make a jest of the conversation, asked me\r\nwhat I intended to do with the trifles that belonged to me and\r\nquarrelled gaily about which should take possession of this and which of\r\nthat. But these first moments of gaiety lasted a very little while and\r\nwe began to weep. Then we heard my father come up the stairs."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior paused for a moment and sighed.\r\n\r\n"It was very hard for my father. I was his only daughter and men often\r\nhave a deeper feeling for their daughters than they ever have for their\r\nsons."\r\n\r\n"It is a great misfortune to have a heart," said Kitty, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"It is a great good fortune to consecrate that heart to the love of\r\nJesus Christ."\r\n\r\nAt that moment a little girl came up to the Mother Superior and\r\nconfident in her interest showed her a fantastic toy that she had\r\nsomehow got hold of. The Mother Superior put her beautiful, delicate\r\nhand round the child\'s shoulder and the child nestled up to her. It\r\nintrigued Kitty to observe how sweet her smile was and yet how\r\nimpersonal.\r\n\r\n"It is wonderful to see the adoration that all your orphans have for\r\nyou, Mother," she said. "I think I should be very proud if I could\r\nexcite so great a devotion."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior gave once more her aloof and yet beautiful smile.\r\n\r\n"There is only one way to win hearts and that is to make oneself like\r\nunto those of whom one would be loved."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxi_\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter did not come back to dinner that evening. Kitty waited for him a\r\nlittle, for when he was detained in the city he always managed to send\r\nher word, but at last she sat down. She made no more than a pretence of\r\neating the many courses which the Chinese cook, with his regard for\r\npropriety notwithstanding pestilence and the difficulty of provisioning,\r\ninvariably set before her; and then, sinking into the long rattan chair\r\nby the open window, surrendered herself to the beauty of the starry\r\nnight. The silence rested her.\r\n\r\nShe did not try to read. Her thoughts floated upon the surface of her\r\nmind like little white clouds reflected on a still lake. She was too\r\ntired to seize upon one, follow it up and absorb herself in its\r\nattendant train. She wondered vaguely what there was for her in the\r\nvarious impressions which her conversations with the nuns had left upon\r\nher. It was singular that, though their way of life so profoundly moved\r\nher, the faith which occasioned it left her untouched. She could not\r\nenvisage the possibility that she might at any time be captured by the\r\nardour of belief. She gave a little sigh: perhaps it would make\r\neverything easier if that great white light should illuminate her soul.\r\nOnce or twice she had had the desire to tell the Mother Superior of her\r\nunhappiness and its cause; but she dared not: she could not bear that\r\nthis austere woman should think ill of her. To her what she had done\r\nwould naturally seem a grievous sin. The odd thing was that she herself\r\ncould not regard it as wicked so much as stupid and ugly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was due to an obtuseness in herself that she looked upon her\r\nconnection with Townsend as regrettable and shocking even, but to be\r\nforgotten rather than to be repented of. It was like making a blunder at\r\na party; there was nothing to do about it, it was dreadfully mortifying,\r\nbut it showed a lack of sense to ascribe too much importance to it. She\r\nshuddered as she thought of Charlie with his large frame too well\r\ncovered, the vagueness of his jaw and the way he had of standing with\r\nhis chest thrown out so that he might not seem to have a paunch. His\r\nsanguine temperament showed itself in the little red veins which soon\r\nwould form a network on his ruddy cheeks. She had liked his bushy\r\neyebrows: there was to her in them now something animal and repulsive.\r\n\r\nAnd the future? It was curious how indifferent it left her; she could\r\nnot see into it at all. Perhaps she would die when her baby was born.\r\nHer sister Doris had always been much stronger than she, and Doris had\r\nnearly died. (She had done her duty and produced an heir to the new\r\nbaronetcy; Kitty smiled as she thought of her mother\'s satisfaction.) If\r\nthe future was so vague it meant perhaps that she was destined never to\r\nsee it. Walter would probably ask her mother to take care of the\r\nchild--if the child survived; and she knew him well enough to be sure\r\nthat, however uncertain of his paternity, he would treat it with\r\nkindness. Walter could be trusted under any circumstances to behave\r\nadmirably.\r\n\r\nIt was a pity that with his great qualities, his unselfishness and\r\nhonour, his intelligence and sensibility, he should be so unlovable. She\r\nwas not in the least frightened of him now, but sorry for him, and at\r\nthe same time she could not help thinking him slightly absurd. The depth\r\nof his emotion made him vulnerable and she had a feeling that somehow\r\nand at some time she so could work upon it as to induce him to forgive\r\nher. The thought haunted her now that in thus giving him peace of mind\r\nshe would make the only possible amends for the anguish she had caused\r\nhim. It was a pity he had so little sense of humour: she could see them\r\nboth, some day, laughing together at the way they had tormented\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nShe was tired. She took the lamp into her room and undressed. She went\r\nto bed and presently fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxii_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut she was awakened by a loud knocking. At first, since it was\r\ninterwoven with the dream from which she was roused, she could not\r\nattach the sound to reality. The knocking went on and she was conscious\r\nthat it must be at the gateway of the compound. It was quite dark. She\r\nhad a watch with phosphorised hands and saw that it was half-past two.\r\nIt must be Walter coming back--how late he was--and he could not awake\r\nthe boy. The knocking went on, louder and louder, and in the silence of\r\nthe night it was really not a little alarming. The knocking stopped and\r\nshe heard the withdrawing of the heavy bolt. Walter had never come back\r\nso late. Poor thing, he must be tired out! She hoped he would have the\r\nsense to go straight to bed instead of working as usual in that\r\nlaboratory of his.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of voices, and people came into the compound. That was\r\nstrange, for Walter coming home late, in order not to disturb her, took\r\npains to be quiet. Two or three persons ran swiftly up the wooden steps\r\nand came into the room next door. Kitty was a little frightened. At the\r\nback of her mind was always the fear of an anti-foreign riot. Had\r\nsomething happened? Her heart began to beat quickly. But before she had\r\ntime to put her vague apprehension into shape some one walked across the\r\nroom and knocked at her door.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Fane."\r\n\r\nShe recognised Waddington\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Yes. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Will you get up at once. I have something to say to you."\r\n\r\nShe rose and put on a dressing-gown. She unlocked the door and opened\r\nit. Her glance took in Waddington in a pair of Chinese trousers and a\r\npongee coat, the house-boy holding a hurricane lamp, and a little\r\nfurther back three Chinese soldiers in khaki. She started as she saw the\r\nconsternation on Waddington\'s face; his head was tousled as though he\r\nhad just jumped out of bed.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" she gasped.\r\n\r\n"You must keep calm. There\'s not a moment to lose. Put on your clothes\r\nat once and come with me."\r\n\r\n"But what is it? Has something happened in the city?"\r\n\r\nThe sight of the soldiers suggested to her at once that there had been\r\nan outbreak and they were come to protect her.\r\n\r\n"Your husband\'s been taken ill. We want you to come at once."\r\n\r\n"Walter?" she cried.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t be upset. I don\'t exactly know what\'s the matter. Colonel\r\nY\xc3\xbc sent this officer to me and asked me to bring you to the Yamen at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\nKitty stared at him for a moment, she felt a sudden cold in her heart,\r\nand then she turned.\r\n\r\n"I shall be ready in two minutes."\r\n\r\n"I came just as I was," he answered. "I was asleep, I just put on a coat\r\nand some shoes."\r\n\r\nShe did not hear what he said. She dressed by the light of the stars,\r\ntaking the first things that came to hand; her fingers on a sudden were\r\nso clumsy that it seemed to take her an age to find the little clasps\r\nthat closed her dress. She put round her shoulders the Cantonese shawl\r\nshe had worn in the evening.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t put a hat on. There\'s no need, is there?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThe boy held the lantern in front of them and they hurried down the\r\nsteps and out of the compound gate.\r\n\r\n"Take care you don\'t fall," said Waddington. "You\'d better hang on to my\r\narm."\r\n\r\nThe soldiers followed immediately behind them.\r\n\r\n"Colonel Y\xc3\xbc has sent chairs. They\'re waiting on the other side of the\r\nriver."\r\n\r\nThey walked quickly down the hill. Kitty could not bring herself to\r\nutter the question that trembled so horribly on her lips. She was\r\nmortally afraid of the answer. They came to the bank and there, with a\r\nthread of light at the bow, a sampan was waiting for them.\r\n\r\n"Is it cholera?" she said then.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so."\r\n\r\nShe gave a little cry and stopped short.\r\n\r\n"I think you ought to come as quickly as you can."\r\n\r\nHe gave her his hand to help her into the boat. The passage was short\r\nand the river almost stagnant; they stood in a bunch at the bow, while a\r\nwoman with a child tied on her hip with one oar impelled the sampan\r\nacross.\r\n\r\n"He was taken ill this afternoon, the afternoon of yesterday that is,"\r\nsaid Waddington.\r\n\r\n"Why wasn\'t I sent for at once?"\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no reason for it they spoke in whispers. In the\r\ndarkness Kitty could only feel how intense was her companion\'s anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Colonel Y\xc3\xbc wanted to, but he wouldn\'t let him. Colonel Y\xc3\xbc has been\r\nwith him all the time."\r\n\r\n"He ought to have sent for me all the same. It\'s heartless."\r\n\r\n"Your husband knew that you had never seen anyone with cholera. It\'s a\r\nterrible and revolting sight. He didn\'t want you to see it."\r\n\r\n"After all he is my husband," she said in a choking voice.\r\n\r\nWaddington made no reply.\r\n\r\n"Why am I allowed to come now?"\r\n\r\nWaddington put his hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you must be very brave. You must be prepared for the worst."\r\n\r\nShe gave a wail of anguish and turned away a little, for she saw that\r\nthe three Chinese soldiers were looking at her. She had a sudden strange\r\nglimpse of the whites of their eyes.\r\n\r\n"Is he dying?"\r\n\r\n"I only know the message Colonel Y\xc3\xbc gave to this officer who came and\r\nfetched me. As far as I can judge collapse has set in."\r\n\r\n"Is there no hope at all?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m dreadfully sorry, I\'m afraid that if we don\'t get there quickly we\r\nshan\'t find him alive."\r\n\r\nShe shuddered. The tears began to stream down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"You see, he\'s been overworking, he has no powers of resistance."\r\n\r\nShe withdrew from the pressure of his arm with a gesture of irritation.\r\nIt exasperated her that he should talk in that low, anguished voice.\r\n\r\nThey reached the side and two men, Chinese coolies, standing on the bank\r\nhelped her to step on shore. The chairs were waiting. As she got into\r\nhers Waddington said to her:\r\n\r\n"Try and keep a tight hold on your nerves. You\'ll want all your\r\nself-control."\r\n\r\n"Tell the bearers to make haste."\r\n\r\n"They have orders to go as fast as they can."\r\n\r\nThe officer, already in his chair, passed by and as he passed called out\r\nto Kitty\'s bearers. They raised the chair smartly, arranged the poles on\r\ntheir shoulders, and at a swift pace set off. Waddington followed close\r\nbehind. They took the hill at a run, a man with a lantern going before\r\neach chair, and at the water-gate the gate-keeper was standing with a\r\ntorch. The officer shouted to him as they approached and he flung open\r\none side of the gate to let them through. He uttered some sort of\r\ninterjection as they passed and the bearers called back. In the dead of\r\nthe night those guttural sounds in a strange language were mysterious\r\nand alarming. They slithered up the wet and slippery cobbles of the\r\nalley and one of the officer\'s bearers stumbled. Kitty heard the\r\nofficer\'s voice raised in anger, the shrill retort of the bearer, and\r\nthen the chair in front hurried on again. The streets were narrow and\r\ntortuous. Here in the city was deep night. It was a city of the dead.\r\nThey hastened along a narrow lane, turned a corner, and then at a run\r\ntook a flight of steps; the bearers were beginning to blow hard; they\r\nwalked with long, rapid strides, in silence; one took out a ragged\r\nhandkerchief and as he walked wiped from his forehead the sweat that ran\r\ndown into his eyes; they wound this way and that so that it might have\r\nbeen a maze through which they sped; in the shadow of the shuttered\r\nshops sometimes a form seemed to be lying, but you did not know whether\r\nit was a man who slept to awake at dawn or a man who slept to awake\r\nnever; the narrow streets were ghostly in their silent emptiness and\r\nwhen on a sudden a dog barked loudly it sent a shock of terror through\r\nKitty\'s tortured nerves. She did not know where they went. The way\r\nseemed endless. Could they not go faster? Faster. Faster. The time was\r\ngoing and any moment it might be too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxiii_\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly, walking along a blank long wall they came to a gateway flanked\r\nby sentry boxes, and the bearers set down the chairs. Waddington hurried\r\nup to Kitty. She had already jumped out. The officer knocked loudly on\r\nthe door and shouted. A postern was opened and they passed into a\r\ncourtyard. It was large and square. Huddled against the walls, under the\r\neaves of the overhanging roofs, soldiers wrapped in their blankets were\r\nlying in huddled groups. They stopped for a moment while the officer\r\nspoke to a man who might have been a sergeant on guard. He turned and\r\nsaid something to Waddington.\r\n\r\n"He\'s still alive," said Waddington in a low voice. "Take care how you\r\nwalk."\r\n\r\nStill preceded by the men with lanterns they made their way across the\r\nyard, up some steps, through a great doorway and then down into another\r\nwide court. On one side of this was a long chamber with lights in it;\r\nthe lights within shining through the rice paper silhouetted the\r\nelaborate pattern of the lattice. The lantern-bearers led them across\r\nthe yard towards this room and at the door the officer knocked. It was\r\nopened immediately and the officer with a glance at Kitty stepped back.\r\n\r\n"Will you walk in," said Waddington.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, low room and the smoky lamps that lit it made the gloom\r\nominous. Three or four orderlies stood about. On a pallet against the\r\nwall opposite the door a man was lying huddled under a blanket. An\r\nofficer was standing motionless at the foot.\r\n\r\nKitty hurried up and leaned over the pallet. Walter lay with his eyes\r\nclosed and in that sombre light his face had the greyness of death. He\r\nwas horribly still.\r\n\r\n"Walter, Walter," she gasped, in a low, terrified tone.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight movement in the body, or the shadow of a movement; it\r\nwas so slight it was like a breath of air which you cannot feel and yet\r\nfor an instant ruffles the surface of still water.\r\n\r\n"Walter, Walter, speak to me."\r\n\r\nThe eyes were opened slowly, as though it were an infinite effort to\r\nraise those heavy lids, but he did not look, he stared at the wall a few\r\ninches from his face. He spoke; his voice, low and weak, had the hint of\r\na smile in it.\r\n\r\n"This is a pretty kettle of fish," he said.\r\n\r\nKitty dared not breathe. He made no further sound, no beginning of a\r\ngesture, but his eyes, those dark, cold eyes of his (seeing now what\r\nmysteries?) stared at the white-washed wall. Kitty raised herself to her\r\nfeet. With haggard gaze she faced the man who stood there.\r\n\r\n"Surely something can be done. You\'re not going to stand there and do\r\nnothing?"\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands. Waddington spoke to the officer who stood at the\r\nend of the bed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid they\'ve done everything that was possible. The regimental\r\nsurgeon has been treating him. Your husband has trained him and he\'s\r\ndone all that your husband could do himself."\r\n\r\n"Is that the surgeon?"\r\n\r\n"No, that is Colonel Y\xc3\xbc. He\'s never left your husband\'s side."\r\n\r\nDistracted, Kitty gave him a glance. He was a tallish man, but stockily\r\nbuilt, and he seemed ill at ease in his khaki uniform. He was looking at\r\nWalter and she saw that his eyes were wet with tears. It gave her a\r\npang. Why should that man with his yellow, flat face have tears in his\r\neyes? It exasperated her.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful to be able to do nothing."\r\n\r\n"At least he\'s not in pain any more," said Waddington.\r\n\r\nShe leaned once more over her husband. Those ghastly eyes of his still\r\nstared vacantly in front of him. She could not tell if he saw with them.\r\nShe did not know whether he had heard what was said. She put her lips\r\nclose to his ears.\r\n\r\n"Walter, isn\'t there something we can do?"\r\n\r\nShe thought that there must be some drug they could give him which would\r\nstay the dreadful ebbing of his life. Now that her eyes were more\r\naccustomed to the dimness she saw with horror that his face had fallen.\r\nShe would hardly have recognised him. It was unthinkable that in a few\r\nshort hours he should look like another man; he hardly looked like a man\r\nat all; he looked like death.\r\n\r\nShe thought that he was making an effort to speak. She put her ear\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t fuss. I\'ve had a rough passage, but I\'m all right now."\r\n\r\nKitty waited for a moment, but he was silent. His immobility rent her\r\nheart with anguish; it was terrifying that he should lie so still. He\r\nseemed prepared already for the stillness of the grave. Some one, the\r\nsurgeon or a dresser, came forward and with a gesture motioned her\r\naside; he leaned over the dying man and with a dirty rag wet his lips.\r\nKitty stood up once more and turned to Waddington despairingly.\r\n\r\n"Is there no hope at all?" she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n"How much longer can he live?"\r\n\r\n"No one can tell. An hour perhaps."\r\n\r\nKitty looked round the bare chamber and her eyes rested for an instant\r\non the substantial form of Colonel Y\xc3\xbc.\r\n\r\n"Can I be left alone with him for a little while?" she asked. "Only for\r\na minute."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if you wish it."\r\n\r\nWaddington stepped over to the Colonel and spoke to him. The Colonel\r\ngave a little bow and then in a low tone an order.\r\n\r\n"We shall wait on the steps," said Waddington as they trooped out. "You\r\nhave only to call."\r\n\r\nNow that the incredible had overwhelmed her consciousness, like a drug\r\ncoursing through her veins, and she realised that Walter was going to\r\ndie she had but one thought, and that was to make his end easier for him\r\nby dragging from his soul the rancour which poisoned it. If he could die\r\nat peace with her it seemed to her that he would die at peace with\r\nhimself. She thought now not of herself at all but only of him.\r\n\r\n"Walter, I beseech you to forgive me," she said, leaning over him. For\r\nfear that he could not bear the pressure she took care not to touch him.\r\n"I\'m so desperately sorry for the wrong I did you. I so bitterly regret\r\nit."\r\n\r\nHe said nothing. He did not seem to hear. She was obliged to insist. It\r\nseemed to her strangely that his soul was a fluttering moth and its\r\nwings were heavy with hatred.\r\n\r\n"Darling."\r\n\r\nA shadow passed over his wan and sunken face. It was less than a\r\nmovement, and yet it gave all the effect of a terrifying convulsion. She\r\nhad never used that word to him before. Perhaps in his dying brain there\r\npassed the thought, confused and difficulty grasped, that he had only\r\nheard her use it, a commonplace of her vocabulary, to dogs and babies\r\nand motor-cars. Then something horrible occurred. She clenched her\r\nhands, trying with all her might to control herself, for she saw two\r\ntears run slowly down his wasted cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my precious, my dear, if you ever loved me--I know you loved me and\r\nI was hateful--I beg you to forgive me. I\'ve no chance now to show my\r\nrepentance. Have mercy on me. I beseech you to forgive."\r\n\r\nShe stopped. She looked at him, all breathless, waiting passionately for\r\na reply. She saw that he tried to speak. Her heart gave a great bound.\r\nIt seemed to her that it would be in a manner a reparation for the\r\nsuffering she had caused him if at this last moment she could effect his\r\ndeliverance from that load of bitterness. His lips moved. He did not\r\nlook at her. His eyes stared unseeing at the white-washed wall. She\r\nleaned over him so that she might hear. But he spoke quite clearly.\r\n\r\n"The dog it was that died."\r\n\r\nShe stayed as still as though she were turned to stone. She could not\r\nunderstand and gazed at him in terrified perplexity. It was meaningless.\r\nDelirium. He had not understood a word she said.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to be so still and yet to live. She stared and stared.\r\nHis eyes were open. She could not tell if he breathed. She began to grow\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n"Walter," she whispered. "Walter."\r\n\r\nAt last, suddenly, she raised herself. A sudden fear seized her. She\r\nturned and went to the door.\r\n\r\n"Will you come, please. He doesn\'t seem to . . ."\r\n\r\nThey stepped in. The little Chinese surgeon went up to the bed. He had\r\nan electric torch in his hand and he lit it and looked at Walter\'s eyes.\r\nThen he closed them. He said something in Chinese. Waddington put his\r\narm round Kitty.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he\'s dead."\r\n\r\nKitty gave a deep sigh. A few tears fell from her eyes. She felt dazed\r\nrather than overcome. The Chinese stood about, round the bed,\r\nhelplessly, as though they did not quite know what to do next.\r\nWaddington was silent. In a minute the Chinese began to speak in a low\r\ntone among themselves.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better let me take you back to the bungalow," said Waddington.\r\n"He\'ll be brought there."\r\n\r\nKitty passed her hand wearily across her forehead. She went up to the\r\npallet bed and leaned over it. She kissed Walter gently on the lips. She\r\nwas not crying now.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to give you so much trouble."\r\n\r\nThe officers saluted as she passed and she gravely bowed. They walked\r\nback across the courtyard and got into their chairs. She saw Waddington\r\nlight a cigarette. A little smoke lost in the air, that was the life of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxiv_\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn was breaking now, and here and there a Chinaman was taking down the\r\nshutters of his shop. In its dark recesses, by the light of a taper, a\r\nwoman was washing her hands and face. In a tea-house at a corner a group\r\nof men were eating an early meal. The grey, cold light of the rising day\r\nsidled along the narrow lanes like a thief. There was a pale mist on the\r\nriver and the masts of the crowded junks loomed through it like the\r\nlances of a phantom army. It was chilly as they crossed and Kitty\r\nhuddled herself up in her gay and coloured shawl. They walked up the\r\nhill and they were above the mist. The sun shone from an unclouded sky.\r\nIt shone as though this were a day like another and nothing had happened\r\nto distinguish it from its fellows.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you like to lie down?" said Waddington when they entered the\r\nbungalow.\r\n\r\n"No. I\'ll sit at the window."\r\n\r\nShe had sat at the window so often and so long during the weeks that had\r\npassed and her eyes now were so familiar with the fantastic, garish,\r\nbeautiful and mysterious temple on its great bastion that it rested her\r\nspirit. It was so unreal, even in the crude light of midday, that it\r\nwithdrew her from the reality of life.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get the boy to make you some tea. I\'m afraid it will be necessary\r\nto bury him this morning. I\'ll make all arrangements."\r\n\r\n"Thank you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxv_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey buried him three hours later. It seemed horrible to Kitty that he\r\nmust be put into a Chinese coffin, as though in so strange a bed he must\r\nrest uneasily, but there was no help for it. The nuns, learning of\r\nWalter\'s death as they learned everything that happened in the city,\r\nsent by a messenger a cross of dahlias, stiff and formal, but made as\r\nthough by the accustomed hands of a florist; and the cross, alone on the\r\nChinese coffin, looked grotesque and out of place. When all was ready\r\nthey had to wait for Colonel Y\xc3\xbc who had sent to Waddington to say that\r\nhe desired to attend the funeral. He came accompanied by an A.D.C. They\r\nwalked up the hill, the coffin borne by half a dozen coolies, to a\r\nlittle plot of land where lay buried the missionary whose place Walter\r\nhad taken. Waddington had found among the missionary\'s effects an\r\nEnglish prayer-book and in a low voice, with an embarrassment that was\r\nunusual to him, read the burial service. Perhaps, reciting those solemn\r\nbut terrible words, the thought hovered in his mind that if he in his\r\nturn fell a victim to the pestilence there would be no one now to say\r\nthem over him. The coffin was lowered into the grave and the\r\ngrave-diggers began to throw in the earth.\r\n\r\nColonel Y\xc3\xbc, who had stood with bared head by the grave-side, put on his\r\nhat, saluted Kitty gravely, said a word or two to Waddington and\r\nfollowed by his A.D.C. walked away. The coolies, curious to watch a\r\nChristian burial, had lingered and now in a straggling group, their\r\nyokes trailing in their hands, sauntered off. Kitty and Waddington\r\nwaited till the grave was filled and then placed on the mound, smelling\r\nof fresh earth, the nuns\' prim dahlias. She had not wept, but when the\r\nfirst shovelful of earth rattled on the coffin she felt a dreadful pang\r\nat her heart.\r\n\r\nShe saw that Waddington was waiting for her to come away.\r\n\r\n"Are you in a hurry?" she asked. "I don\'t want to go back to the\r\nbungalow just yet."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to do. I am entirely in your hands."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxvi_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey sauntered along the causeway till they came to the top of the hill\r\non which stood that archway, the memorial to a virtuous widow, which had\r\noccupied so large a part of Kitty\'s impression of the place. It was a\r\nsymbol, but of what she scarcely knew; she could not tell why it bore a\r\nnote of so sardonic irony.\r\n\r\n"Shall we sit down a little? We haven\'t sat here for ages." The plain\r\nwas spread before her widely; it was tranquil and serene in the morning\r\nlight. "It\'s only a few weeks that I\'ve been here and it seems a\r\nlifetime."\r\n\r\nHe did not answer and for a while she allowed her thoughts to wander.\r\nShe gave a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Do you think that the soul is immortal?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem surprised at the question.\r\n\r\n"How should I know?"\r\n\r\n"Just now, when they\'d washed Walter, before they put him into the\r\ncoffin I looked at him. He looked very young. Too young to die. Do you\r\nremember that beggar that we saw the first time you took me for a walk?\r\nI was frightened not because he was dead, but because he looked as\r\nthough he\'d never been a human being. He was just a dead animal. And now\r\nagain, with Walter, it looked so like a machine that has run down.\r\nThat\'s what is so frightening. And if it is only a machine how futile is\r\nall this suffering and the heart pains and the misery."\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, but his eyes travelled over the landscape at their\r\nfeet. The wide expanse on that gay and sunny morning filled the heart\r\nwith exultation. The trim little rice fields stretched as far as the eye\r\ncould see and in many of them the blue-clad peasants with their\r\nbuffaloes were working industriously. It was a peaceful and a happy\r\nscene. Kitty broke the silence.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you how deeply moved I\'ve been by all I\'ve seen at the\r\nconvent. They\'re wonderful, those nuns, they make me feel utterly\r\nworthless. They give up everything, their home, their country, love,\r\nchildren, freedom; and all the little things which I sometimes think\r\nmust be harder still to give up, flowers and green fields, going for a\r\nwalk on an autumn day, books and music, comfort, everything they give\r\nup, everything. And they do it so that they may devote themselves to a\r\nlife of sacrifice and poverty, obedience, killing work and prayer. To\r\nall of them this world is really and truly a place of exile. Life is a\r\ncross which they willingly bear, but in their hearts all the time is the\r\ndesire--oh, it\'s so much stronger than desire, it\'s a longing, an eager,\r\npassionate longing for the death which shall lead them to life\r\neverlasting."\r\n\r\nKitty clasped her hands and looked at him with anguish.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Supposing there is no life everlasting? Think what it means if death is\r\nreally the end of all things. They\'ve given up all for nothing. They\'ve\r\nbeen cheated. They\'re dupes."\r\n\r\nWaddington reflected for a little while.\r\n\r\n"I wonder. I wonder if it matters that what they have aimed at is\r\nillusion. Their lives are in themselves beautiful. I have an idea that\r\nthe only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in\r\nwithout disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the\r\nchaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they\r\nwrite, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is\r\nthe beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art."\r\n\r\nKitty sighed. What he said seemed hard. She wanted more.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever been to a symphony concert?" he continued.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she smiled. "I know nothing of music, but I\'m rather fond of it."\r\n\r\n"Each member of the orchestra plays his own little instrument, and what\r\ndo you think he knows of the complicated harmonies which unroll\r\nthemselves on the indifferent air? He is concerned only with his own\r\nsmall share. But he knows that the symphony is lovely, and though\r\nthere\'s none to hear it, it is lovely still, and he is content to play\r\nhis part."\r\n\r\n"You spoke of Tao the other day," said Kitty, after a pause. "Tell me\r\nwhat it is."\r\n\r\nWaddington gave her a little look, hesitated an instant, and then with a\r\nfaint smile on his comic face answered:\r\n\r\n"It is the Way and the Waygoer. It is the eternal road along which walk\r\nall beings, but no being made it, for itself is being. It is everything\r\nand nothing. From it all things spring, all things conform to it, and to\r\nit at last all things return. It is a square without angles, a sound\r\nwhich ears cannot hear, and an image without form. It is a vast net and\r\nthough its meshes are as wide as the sea it lets nothing through. It is\r\nthe sanctuary where all things find refuge. It is nowhere, but without\r\nlooking out of the window you may see it. Desire not to desire, it\r\nteaches, and leave all things to take their course. He that humbles\r\nhimself shall be preserved entire. He that bends shall be made straight.\r\nFailure is the foundation of success and success is the lurking-place of\r\nfailure; but who can tell when the turning point will come? He who\r\nstrives after tenderness can become even as a little child. Gentleness\r\nbrings victory to him who attacks and safety to him who defends. Mighty\r\nis he who conquers himself."\r\n\r\n"Does it mean anything?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, when I\'ve had half a dozen whiskies and look at the stars, I\r\nthink perhaps it does."\r\n\r\nSilence fell upon them and when it was broken it was again by Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, is: the dog it was that died, a quotation?"\r\n\r\nWaddington\'s lips outlined a smile and he was ready with his answer. But\r\nperhaps at that moment his sensibilities were abnormally acute. Kitty\r\nwas not looking at him, but there was something about her expression\r\nwhich made him change his mind.\r\n\r\n"If it is I don\'t know it," he answered warily. "Why?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. It crossed my mind. It had a familiar ring."\r\n\r\nThere was another silence.\r\n\r\n"When you were alone with your husband," said Waddington presently, "I\r\nhad a talk with the regimental surgeon. I thought we ought to have some\r\ndetails."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"He was in a very hysterical state. I couldn\'t really quite understand\r\nwhat he meant. So far as I can make out your husband got infected during\r\nthe course of experiments he was making."\r\n\r\n"He was always experimenting. He wasn\'t really a doctor, he was a\r\nbacteriologist; that is why he was so anxious to come here."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t quite make out from the surgeon\'s statements whether he was\r\ninfected accidentally or whether he was actually experimenting on\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\nKitty grew very pale. The suggestion made her shudder. Waddington took\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me for talking about this again," he said gently, "but I\r\nthought it might comfort you--I know how frightfully difficult it is on\r\nthese occasions to say anything that is of the least use--I thought it\r\nmight mean something to you that Walter died a martyr to science and to\r\nhis duty."\r\n\r\nKitty shrugged her shoulders with a suspicion of impatience.\r\n\r\n"Walter died of a broken heart," she said.\r\n\r\nWaddington did not answer. She turned and looked at him slowly. Her face\r\nwas white and set.\r\n\r\n"What did he mean by saying: the dog it was that died? What is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the last line of Goldsmith\'s _Elegy_."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxvii_\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Kitty went to the convent. The girl who opened the door\r\nseemed surprised to see her and when Kitty had been for a few minutes\r\nabout her work the Mother Superior came in. She went up to Kitty and\r\ntook her hand.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see you, my dear child. You show a fine courage in coming\r\nback here so soon after your great sorrow; and wisdom, for I am sure\r\nthat a little work will keep you from brooding."\r\n\r\nKitty cast down her eyes, reddening a little; she did not want the\r\nMother Superior to see into her heart.\r\n\r\n"I need not tell you how sincerely all of us here sympathise with you."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind," whispered Kitty.\r\n\r\n"We all pray for you constantly and for the soul of him you have lost."\r\n\r\nKitty made no reply. The Mother Superior released her hand and in her\r\ncool, authoritative tone imposed various tasks upon her. She patted two\r\nor three children on the head, gave them her aloof, but winning smile,\r\nand went about her more pressing affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxviii_\r\n\r\n\r\nA week went by. Kitty was sewing. The Mother Superior entered the room\r\nand sat down beside her. She gave Kitty\'s work a shrewd glance.\r\n\r\n"You sew very well, my dear. It is a rare accomplishment for young women\r\nof your world nowadays."\r\n\r\n"I owe it to my mother."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that your mother will be very glad to see you again."\r\n\r\nKitty looked up. There was that in the Mother Superior\'s manner which\r\nprevented the remark from being taken as a casual politeness. She went\r\non.\r\n\r\n"I allowed you to come here after the death of your dear husband because\r\nI thought occupation would distract your mind. I did not think you were\r\nfit at that moment to take the long journey to Tching-Yen by yourself,\r\nnor did I wish you to sit alone in your house with nothing to do but to\r\nremember your loss. But now eight days have passed. It is time for you\r\nto go."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go, Mother. I want to stay here."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing for you to stay for. You came to be with your husband.\r\nYou husband is dead. You are in a condition in which you will shortly\r\nneed a care and attention which it is impossible for you to get here. It\r\nis your duty, my dear child, to do everything in your power for the\r\nwelfare of the being that God has entrusted to your care."\r\n\r\nKitty was silent for a moment. She looked down.\r\n\r\n"I was under the impression that I was of some use here. It has been a\r\ngreat pleasure to me to think that I was. I hoped that you would allow\r\nme to go on with my work till the epidemic had come to an end."\r\n\r\n"We are all very grateful for what you have done for us," answered the\r\nSuperior, with a slight smile, "but now that the epidemic is waning the\r\nrisk of coming here is not so great and I am expecting two sisters from\r\nCanton. They should be here very shortly and when they arrive I do not\r\nthink that I shall be able to make any use of your services."\r\n\r\nKitty\'s heart sank. The Mother Superior\'s tone admitted of no reply; she\r\nknew her well enough to know that she would be insensible to entreaty.\r\nThat she found it necessary to reason with Kitty had brought into her\r\nvoice a note, if hardly of irritation, at least of the peremptoriness\r\nwhich might lead to it.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Waddington was good enough to ask my advice."\r\n\r\n"I wish he could have minded his own business," interrupted Kitty.\r\n\r\n"If he hadn\'t I should all the same have felt obliged to give it him,"\r\nsaid the Mother Superior gently. "At the present moment your place is\r\nnot here, but with your mother. Mr. Waddington has arranged with Colonel\r\nY\xc3\xbc to give you a strong escort so that you will be perfectly safe on\r\nthe journey, and he has arranged for bearers and coolies. The amah will\r\ngo with you and arrangements will be made at the cities you pass\r\nthrough. In fact, everything possible for your comfort has been done."\r\n\r\nKitty\'s lips tightened. She thought that they might at least have\r\nconsulted her in a matter which only concerned herself. She had to\r\nexercise some self-control in order not to answer sharply.\r\n\r\n"And when am I to start?"\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior remained quite placid.\r\n\r\n"The sooner you can get back to Tching-Yen and then sail to England the\r\nbetter, my dear child. We thought you would like to start at dawn the\r\nday after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"So soon."\r\n\r\nKitty felt a little inclined to cry. But it was true enough; she had no\r\nplace there.\r\n\r\n"You all seem in a great hurry to be rid of me," she said ruefully.\r\n\r\nKitty was conscious of a relaxation in the Superior\'s demeanour. She saw\r\nthat Kitty was prepared to yield and unconsciously she assumed a more\r\ngracious tone. Kitty\'s sense of humour was acute and her eyes twinkled\r\nas she reflected that even the saints liked to have their own way.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think that I fail to appreciate the goodness of your heart, my\r\ndear child, and the admirable charity which makes you unwilling to\r\nabandon your self-imposed duties."\r\n\r\nKitty stared straight in front of her. She faintly shrugged her\r\nshoulders. She knew that she could ascribe to herself no such exalted\r\nvirtues. She wanted to stay because she had nowhere else to go. It was a\r\ncurious sensation this, that nobody in the world cared two straws\r\nwhether she was alive or dead.\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand that you should be reluctant to go home," pursued\r\nthe Superior amiably. "There are many foreigners in this country who\r\nwould give a great deal to have your chance!"\r\n\r\n"But not you, Mother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, with us it is different, my dear child. When we come here we know\r\nthat we have left our homes for ever."\r\n\r\nOut of her own wounded feelings emerged the desire in Kitty\'s mind,\r\nmalicious perhaps, to seek the joint in the armour of faith which\r\nrendered the nuns so aloofly immune to all the natural feelings. She\r\nwanted to see whether there was left in the Superior any of the weakness\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\n"I should have thought that sometimes it was hard never to see again\r\nthose that are dear to you and the scenes amid which you were brought\r\nup."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior hesitated for a moment, but Kitty watching her could\r\nsee no change in the serenity of her beautiful and austere face.\r\n\r\n"It is hard for my mother who is old now, for I am her only daughter and\r\nshe would dearly like to see me once more before she dies. I wish I\r\ncould give her that joy. But it cannot be and we shall wait till we can\r\nmeet in paradise."\r\n\r\n"All the same, when one thinks of those to whom one is so dear, it must\r\nbe difficult not to ask oneself if one was right in cutting oneself off\r\nfrom them."\r\n\r\n"Are you asking me if I have ever regretted the step I took?" On a\r\nsudden the Mother Superior\'s face grew radiant. "Never, never. I have\r\nexchanged a life that was trivial and worthless for one of sacrifice and\r\nprayer."\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence and then the Mother Superior, assuming a\r\nlighter manner, smiled.\r\n\r\n"I am going to ask you to take a little parcel and post it for me when\r\nyou get to Marseilles. I do not wish to entrust it to the Chinese\r\npost-office. I will fetch it at once."\r\n\r\n"You can give it to me to-morrow," said Kitty.\r\n\r\n"You will be too busy to come here to-morrow, my dear. It will be more\r\nconvenient for you to bid us farewell to-night."\r\n\r\nShe rose and with the easy dignity which her voluminous habit could not\r\nconceal left the room. In a moment Sister St. Joseph came in. She was\r\ncome to say good-bye. She hoped that Kitty would have a pleasant\r\njourney; she would be quite safe, for Colonel Y\xc3\xbc was sending a strong\r\nescort with her; and the sisters constantly did the journey alone and no\r\nharm came to them. And did she like the sea? _Mon Dieu_, how ill she was\r\nwhen there was a storm in the Indian ocean, _Madame_ her mother would be\r\npleased to see her daughter, and she must take care of herself; after\r\nall she had another little soul in her care now, and they would all pray\r\nfor her; she would pray constantly for her and the dear little baby and\r\nfor the soul of the poor, brave doctor. She was voluble, kindly and\r\naffectionate; and yet Kitty was deeply conscious that for Sister St.\r\nJoseph (her gaze intent on eternity) she was but a wraith without body\r\nor substance. She had a wild impulse to seize the stout, good-natured\r\nnun by the shoulders and shake her, crying: "Don\'t you know that I\'m a\r\nhuman being, unhappy and alone, and I want comfort and sympathy and\r\nencouragement; oh, can\'t you turn a minute away from God and give me a\r\nlittle compassion; not the Christian compassion that you have for all\r\nsuffering things, but just human compassion for me?" The thought brought\r\na smile to Kitty\'s lips: how very surprised Sister St. Joseph would be!\r\nShe would certainly be convinced of what now she only suspected, that\r\nall English people were mad.\r\n\r\n"Fortunately I am a very good sailor," Kitty answered. "I\'ve never been\r\nsea-sick yet."\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior returned with a small, neat parcel.\r\n\r\n"They\'re handkerchiefs that I\'ve had made for the name-day of my\r\nmother," she said. "The initials have been embroidered by our young\r\ngirls."\r\n\r\nSister St. Joseph suggested that Kitty would like to see how beautifully\r\nthe work was done and the Mother Superior with an indulgent, deprecating\r\nsmile untied the parcel. The handkerchiefs were of very fine lawn and\r\nthe initials embroidered in a complicated cypher were surmounted by a\r\ncrown of strawberry leaves. When Kitty had properly admired the\r\nworkmanship the handkerchiefs were wrapped up again and the parcel\r\nhanded to her. Sister St. Joseph, with an "_eh bien, Madame, je vous\r\nquitte_" and a repetition of her polite and impersonal salutations, went\r\naway. Kitty realised that this was the moment to take her leave of the\r\nSuperior. She thanked her for her kindness to her. They walked together\r\nalong the bare, white-washed corridors.\r\n\r\n"Would it be asking too much of you to register the parcel when you\r\narrive at Marseilles?" said the Superior.\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'ll do that," said Kitty.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the address. The name seemed very grand, but the place\r\nmentioned attracted her attention.\r\n\r\n"But that is one of the _ch\xc3\xa2teaux_ I\'ve seen. I was motoring with\r\nfriends in France."\r\n\r\n"It is very possible," said the Mother Superior. "Strangers are\r\npermitted to view it on two days a week."\r\n\r\n"I think if I had ever lived in such a beautiful place I should never\r\nhave had the courage to leave it."\r\n\r\n"It is of course a historical monument. It is scarcely intimate. If I\r\nregretted anything it would not be that, but the little _ch\xc3\xa2teau_ that\r\nwe lived in when I was a child. It was in the Pyrenees. I was born\r\nwithin sound of the sea. I do not deny that sometimes I should like to\r\nhear the waves beating against the rocks."\r\n\r\nKitty had an idea that the Mother Superior, divining her thought and the\r\nreason for her remarks, was slyly making fun of her. But they reached\r\nthe little, unpretentious door of the convent. To Kitty\'s surprise the\r\nMother Superior took her in her arms and kissed her. The pressure of her\r\npale lips on Kitty\'s cheeks, she kissed her first on one side and then\r\non the other, was so unexpected that it made her flush and inclined to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, God bless you, my dear child." She held her for a moment in\r\nher arms. "Remember that it is nothing to do your duty, that is demanded\r\nof you and is no more meritorious than to wash your hands when they are\r\ndirty; the only thing that counts is the love of duty; when love and\r\nduty are one, then grace is in you and you will enjoy a happiness which\r\npasses all understanding."\r\n\r\nThe convent door closed for the last time behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxix_\r\n\r\n\r\nWaddington walked with Kitty up the hill and they turned aside for a\r\nmoment to look at Walter\'s grave; at the memorial arch he said good-bye\r\nto her, and looking at it for the last time she felt that she could\r\nreply to the enigmatic irony of its appearance with an equal irony of\r\nher own. She stepped into her chair.\r\n\r\nOne day passed after the other. The sights of the wayside served as a\r\nbackground to her thoughts. She saw them as it were in duplicate,\r\nrounded as though in a stereoscope, with an added significance because\r\nto everything she saw was added the recollection of what she had seen\r\nwhen but a few short weeks before she had taken the same journey in the\r\ncontrary direction. The coolies with their loads straggled disorderly,\r\ntwo or three together, and then a hundred yards behind one by himself,\r\nand then two or three more; the soldiers of the escort shuffled along\r\nwith a clumsy walk that covered five and twenty miles a day; the amah\r\nwas carried by two bearers and Kitty, not because she was heavier, but\r\nfor face\'s sake, by four. Now and then they met a string of coolies\r\nlolloping by in line with their heavy burdens, now and then a Chinese\r\nofficial in a sedan who looked at the white woman with inquisitive eyes;\r\nnow they came across peasants in faded blue and huge hats on their way\r\nto market and now a woman, old or young, tottering along on her bound\r\nfeet. They passed up and down little hills laid out with trim rice\r\nfields and farm-houses nestling cosily in a grove of bamboos; they\r\npassed through ragged villages and populous cities walled like the\r\ncities in a missal. The sun of the early autumn was pleasant, and if at\r\ndaybreak, when the shimmering dawn lent the neat fields the enchantment\r\nof a fairy tale, it was cold, the warmth later was very grateful. Kitty\r\nwas filled by it with a sense of beatitude which she made no effort to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nThe vivid scenes with their elegant colour, their unexpected\r\ndistinction, and their strangeness, were like an arras before which,\r\nlike mysterious, shadowy shapes, played the phantoms of Kitty\'s fancy.\r\nThey seemed wholly unreal. Mei-tan-fu with its crenellated walls was\r\nlike the painted canvas placed on the stage in an old play to represent\r\na city. The nuns, Waddington and the Manchu woman who loved him, were\r\nfantastic characters in a masque; and the rest, the people sidling along\r\nthe tortuous streets and those who died, were nameless supers. Of course\r\nit had, they all had, a significance of some sort, but what was it? It\r\nwas as though they performed a ritual dance, elaborate and ancient, and\r\nyou knew that those complicated measures had a meaning which it was\r\nimportant for you to know; and yet you could see no clue, no clue.\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible to Kitty (an old woman was passing along the\r\ncauseway, in blue, and the blue in the sunshine was like lapis lazuli;\r\nher face with its thousand little wrinkles was like a mask of old ivory;\r\nand she leaned, as she walked on her tiny feet, on a long black staff),\r\nit seemed incredible to Kitty that she and Walter had taken part in that\r\nstrange and unreal dance. They had played important parts too. She might\r\neasily have lost her life: he had. Was it a joke? Perhaps it was nothing\r\nbut a dream from which she would suddenly awake with a sigh of relief.\r\nIt seemed to have taken place a long time ago and in a far-off place. It\r\nwas singular how shadowy the persons of that play seemed against the\r\nsunny background of real life. And now it seemed to Kitty like a story\r\nthat she was reading; it was a little startling that it seemed to\r\nconcern her so little. She found already that she could not recall with\r\ndistinctness Waddington\'s face which had been so familiar to her.\r\n\r\nThis evening they should reach the city on the Western River from which\r\nshe was to take the steamer. Thence it was but a night\'s run to\r\nTching-Yen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxx_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first because she had not wept when Walter died she was ashamed. It\r\nseemed dreadfully callous. Why, the eyes of the Chinese officer, Colonel\r\nY\xc3\xbc, had been wet with tears. She was dazed by her husband\'s death. It\r\nwas difficult to understand that he would not come into the bungalow\r\nagain and that when he got up in the morning she would not hear him take\r\nhis bath, in the Suchow tub. He was alive and now he was dead. The\r\nsisters wondered at her Christian resignation and admired the courage\r\nwith which she bore her loss. But Waddington was shrewd; for all his\r\ngrave sympathy she had a feeling that--how should she put it?--that he\r\nhad his tongue in his cheek. Of course, Walter\'s death had been a shock\r\nto her. She didn\'t want him to die. But after all she didn\'t love him,\r\nshe had never loved him; it was decent to bear herself with becoming\r\nsorrow; it would be ugly and vulgar even to let anyone see into her\r\nheart; but she had gone through too much to make pretences to herself.\r\nIt seemed to her that this at least the last few weeks had taught her,\r\nthat if it is necessary sometimes to lie to others it is always\r\ndespicable to lie to oneself. She was sorry that Walter had died in that\r\ntragic manner, but she was sorry with a purely human sorrow such as she\r\nmight have felt if it had been an acquaintance. She would acknowledge\r\nthat Walter had admirable qualities; it just happened that she did not\r\nlike him; he had always bored her. She would not admit that his death\r\nwas a relief to her, she could say honestly that if by a word of hers\r\nshe could bring him back to life she would say it, but she could not\r\nresist the feeling that his death made her way to some extent a trifle\r\neasier. They would never have been happy together and yet to part would\r\nhave been terribly difficult. She was startled at herself for feeling as\r\nshe did; she supposed that people would think her heartless and cruel if\r\nthey knew. Well, they shouldn\'t know. She wondered if all her fellows\r\nhad in their hearts shameful secrets which they spent their time\r\nguarding from curious glances.\r\n\r\nShe looked very little into the future and she made no plans. The only\r\nthing she knew was that she wanted to stay in Tching-Yen as short a\r\nwhile as might be. She looked forward to arriving there with horror. It\r\nseemed to her that she would like to wander for ever through that\r\nsmiling and friendly country in her rattan chair, and, an indifferent\r\nspectator for ever of the phantasmagoria of life, pass each night under\r\na different roof. But of course the immediate future must be faced: she\r\nwould go to the hotel when she reached Tching-Yen, she would arrange\r\nabout getting rid of the house and selling the furniture; there would be\r\nno need to see Townsend. He would have the grace to keep out of her way.\r\nShe would like, all the same, to see him once more in order to tell him\r\nwhat a despicable creature she thought him.\r\n\r\nBut what did Charles Townsend matter?\r\n\r\nLike a rich melody on a harp that rang in exultant arpeggios through the\r\ncomplicated harmonies of a symphony, one thought beat in her heart\r\ninsistently. It was this thought which gave their exotic beauty to the\r\nrice fields, which made a little smile break on her pale lips as a\r\nsmooth-faced lad swung past her on his way to the market town with\r\nexultation in his carriage and audacity in his eyes, and which gave the\r\nmagic of a tumultuous life to the cities she passed through. The city of\r\nthe pestilence was a prison from which she was escaped, and she had\r\nnever known before how exquisite was the blueness of the sky and what a\r\njoy there was in the bamboo copses that leaned with such an adorable\r\ngrace across the causeway. Freedom! That was the thought that sung in\r\nher heart so that even though the future was so dim, it was iridescent\r\nlike the mist over the river where the morning sun fell upon it.\r\nFreedom! Not only freedom from a bond that irked, and a companionship\r\nwhich depressed her; freedom, not only from the death which had\r\nthreatened, but freedom from the love that had degraded her; freedom\r\nfrom all spiritual ties, the freedom of a disembodied spirit; and with\r\nfreedom, courage and a valiant unconcern for whatever was to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxi_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the boat docked at Tching-Yen Kitty, who had been standing on deck\r\nto look at the coloured, gay and vivacious traffic of the river, went\r\ninto her cabin to see that the amah had left nothing behind. She gave\r\nherself a look in the glass. She wore black, the nuns had dyed a dress\r\nfor her, but not mourning; and the thought crossed her mind that the\r\nfirst thing she must do was to see to this. The habiliments of woe could\r\nnot but serve as an effective disguise to her unexpected feelings. There\r\nwas a knock on her cabin door. The amah opened it.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Fane."\r\n\r\nKitty turned round and saw a face which at the first moment she did not\r\nrecognise. Then her heart gave a sudden quick beat and she flushed. It\r\nwas Dorothy Townsend. Kitty so little expected to see her that she knew\r\nneither what to do nor what to say. But Mrs. Townsend came into the\r\ncabin and with an impulsive gesture took Kitty in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, my dear, I\'m so dreadfully sorry for you."\r\n\r\nKitty allowed herself to be kissed. She was a little surprised at this\r\neffusiveness in a woman whom she had always thought cold and distant.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind of you," murmured Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Come on deck. The amah will look after your things and my boys are\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nShe took Kitty\'s hand and Kitty, allowing herself to be led, noticed\r\nthat her good-natured, weather-beaten face bore an expression of real\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n"Your boat\'s early, I very nearly didn\'t get down in time," said Mrs.\r\nTownsend. "I couldn\'t have borne it if I\'d missed you."\r\n\r\n"But you didn\'t come to meet me?" exclaimed Kitty.\r\n\r\n"Of course I did."\r\n\r\n"But how did you know I was coming?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Waddington sent me a telegram."\r\n\r\nKitty turned away. She had a lump in her throat. It was funny that a\r\nlittle unexpected kindness should so affect her. She did not want to\r\ncry; she wished Dorothy Townsend would go away. But Dorothy took the\r\nhand that was hanging by Kitty\'s side and pressed it. It embarrassed\r\nKitty that this shy woman should be so demonstrative.\r\n\r\n"I want you to do me a great favour. Charlie and I want you to come and\r\nstay with us while you\'re in Tching-Yen."\r\n\r\nKitty snatched her hand away.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awfully kind of you. I couldn\'t possibly."\r\n\r\n"But you must. You can\'t go and live all by yourself in your own house.\r\nIt would be dreadful for you. I\'ve prepared everything. You shall have\r\nyour own sitting-room. You can have your meals there if you don\'t care\r\nto have them with us. We both want you to come."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t thinking of going to the house. I was going to get myself a\r\nroom at the Tching-Yen Hotel. I couldn\'t possibly put you to so much\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\nThe suggestion had taken her by surprise. She was confused and vexed. If\r\nCharlie had had any sense of decency he would never have allowed his\r\nwife to make the invitation. She did not wish to be under an obligation\r\nto either of them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I couldn\'t bear the idea of your living at a hotel. And you\'d\r\nhate the Tching-Yen Hotel just now. With all those people about and the\r\nband playing jazz all the time. Please say you\'ll come to us. I promise\r\nyou that Charlie and I won\'t bother you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should be so kind to me." Kitty was getting a\r\nlittle short of excuses; she could not bring herself to utter a blunt\r\nand definite no. "I\'m afraid I\'m not very good company among strangers\r\njust now."\r\n\r\n"But need we be strangers to you? Oh, I do so want not to be, I so want\r\nyou to allow me to be your friend." Dorothy clasped her hands and her\r\nvoice, her cool, deliberate and distinguished voice, was tremulous with\r\ntears. "I so awfully want you to come. You see, I want to make amends to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nKitty did not understand. She did not know what amends Charlie\'s wife\r\nowed her.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I didn\'t very much like you at first. I thought you rather\r\nfast. You see, I\'m old-fashioned and I suppose I\'m intolerant."\r\n\r\nKitty gave her a passing glance. What she meant was that at first she\r\nhad thought Kitty vulgar. Though Kitty allowed no shadow of it to show\r\non her face in her heart she laughed. Much she cared for what any one\r\nthought of her now!\r\n\r\n"And when I heard that you\'d gone with your husband into the jaws of\r\ndeath, without a moment\'s hesitation, I felt such a frightful cad. I\r\nfelt so humiliated. You\'ve been so wonderful, you\'ve been so brave, you\r\nmake all the rest of us look so dreadfully cheap and second-rate." Now\r\nthe tears were pouring down her kind, homely face. "I can\'t tell you how\r\nmuch I admire you and what a respect I have for you. I know I can do\r\nnothing to make up for your terrible loss, but I want you to know how\r\ndeeply, how sincerely I feel for you. And if you\'ll only allow me to do\r\na little something for you it will be a privilege. Don\'t bear me a\r\ngrudge because I misjudged you. You\'re heroic and I\'m just a silly fool\r\nof a woman."\r\n\r\nKitty looked down at the deck. She was very pale. She wished that\r\nDorothy would not show such uncontrollable emotion. She was touched, it\r\nwas true, but she could not help a slight feeling of impatience that\r\nthis simple creature should believe such lies.\r\n\r\n"If you really mean that you\'d like to have me, of course I shall be\r\nglad to come," she sighed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxii_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Townsends lived on the Mount in a house with a wide view over the\r\nsea, and Charlie did not as a rule come up to luncheon, but on the day\r\nof Kitty\'s arrival Dorothy (they were Kitty and Dorothy to one another\r\nby now) told her that if she felt up to seeing him he would like to come\r\nand bid her welcome. Kitty reflected that since she must see him she\r\nmight just as well see him at once and she looked forward with grim\r\namusement to the embarrassment she must cause him. She saw very well\r\nthat the invitation to stay had arisen in his wife\'s fancy and\r\nnotwithstanding his own feelings he had immediately approved. Kitty knew\r\nhow great his desire was always to do the right thing and to offer her a\r\ngracious hospitality was obviously very much the right thing. But he\r\ncould hardly remember that last interview of theirs without\r\nmortification: to a man so vain as Townsend it must be galling like an\r\nulcer that would not heal. She hoped that she had hurt him as much as he\r\nhad hurt her. He must hate her now. She was glad to think that she did\r\nnot hate, but only despised him. It gave her a sardonic satisfaction to\r\nreflect that whatever his feelings he would be obliged to make much of\r\nher. When she left his office that afternoon he must have hoped with all\r\nhis heart that he would never set eyes on her again.\r\n\r\nAnd now, sitting with Dorothy, she waited for him to come in. She was\r\nconscious of her delight in the sober luxury of the drawing-room. She\r\nsat in an armchair, there were lovely flowers here and there, on the\r\nwalls were pleasing pictures; the room was shaded and cool, it was\r\nfriendly and homelike. She remembered with a faint shudder the bare and\r\nempty parlour of the missionary\'s bungalow; the rattan chairs and the\r\nkitchen-table with its cotton cloth, the stained shelves with all those\r\ncheap editions of novels, and the little skimpy red curtains that had\r\nsuch a dusty look. Oh, it had been so uncomfortable! She supposed that\r\nDorothy had never thought of that.\r\n\r\nThey heard a motor drive up, and Charlie strode into the room.\r\n\r\n"Am I late? I hope I haven\'t kept you waiting. I had to see the Governor\r\nand I simply couldn\'t get away."\r\n\r\nHe went up to Kitty, and took both her hands.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so very, very glad you\'ve come here. I know Dorothy has told you\r\nthat we want you to stay as long as ever you like and that we want you\r\nto look upon our house as your home. But I want to tell you so myself as\r\nwell. If there\'s anything in the world I can do for you I shall only be\r\ntoo happy." His eyes wore a charming expression of sincerity; she\r\nwondered if he saw the irony in hers. "I\'m awfully stupid at saying some\r\nthings and I don\'t want to seem a clumsy fool, but I do want you to know\r\nhow deeply I sympathise with you in your husband\'s death. He was a\r\nthundering good chap, and he\'ll be missed here more than I can say."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Charlie," said his wife. "I\'m sure Kitty understands. . . . Here\r\nare the cocktails."\r\n\r\nFollowing the luxurious custom of the foreigners in China two boys in\r\nuniform came into the room with savouries and cocktails. Kitty refused.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must have one," insisted Townsend in his breezy, cordial way.\r\n"It\'ll do you good and I\'m sure you haven\'t had such a thing as a\r\ncocktail since you left Tching-Yen. Unless I\'m very much mistaken you\r\ncouldn\'t get ice at Mei-tan-fu."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not mistaken," said Kitty.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she had a picture before her mind\'s eye of that beggar with\r\nthe tousled head in the blue rags through which you saw the emaciated\r\nlimbs, who had lain dead against the compound wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxiii_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey went in to luncheon. Charlie, sitting at the head of his table,\r\neasily took charge of the conversation. After those first few words of\r\nsympathy he treated Kitty, not as though she had just suffered a\r\ndevastating experience, but rather as though she had come in from\r\nShanghai for a change after an operation for appendicitis. She needed\r\ncheering and he was prepared to cheer her. The best way of making her\r\nfeel at home was to treat her as one of the family. He was a tactful\r\nman. He began talking of the autumn race meeting, and the polo--by Jove,\r\nhe would have to give up playing polo if he couldn\'t get his weight\r\ndown--and a chat he had had that morning with the Governor. He spoke of\r\na party they had been to on the Admiral\'s flag-ship, the state of\r\naffairs in Canton, and of the links at Lushan. In a few minutes Kitty\r\nfelt that she might have been away for no longer than a week-end. It was\r\nincredible that over there, up-country, six hundred miles away only (the\r\ndistance from London to Edinburgh, wasn\'t it?) men, women and children\r\nhad been dying like flies. Soon she found herself asking about so and so\r\nwho had broken a collar-bone at polo and if Mrs. This had gone home or\r\nMrs. That was playing in the tennis tournament. Charlie made his little\r\njokes and she smiled at them. Dorothy with her faint air of superiority\r\n(which now included Kitty and so was no longer slightly offensive, but a\r\nbond of union rather) was gently ironic about various persons in the\r\ncolony. Kitty began to feel more alert.\r\n\r\n"Why, she\'s looking better already," said Charlie to his wife. "She was\r\nso pale before tiffin that I was quite startled; she\'s really got some\r\ncolour in her cheeks now."\r\n\r\nBut while she took her part in the conversation, if not with gaiety (for\r\nshe felt that neither Dorothy nor Charlie with his admirable sense of\r\ndecorum would approve of that) at least with cheerfulness, Kitty\r\nobserved her host. In all those weeks during which her fancy had been\r\nrevengefully occupied with him she had built up in her mind a very vivid\r\nimpression of him. His thick curling hair was a little too long and too\r\ncarefully brushed, in order to hide the fact that it was greying there\r\nwas too much oil on it; his face was too red, with its network of mauve\r\nveins on the cheeks, and his jowl was too massive: when he did not hold\r\nhis head up to hide it you saw that he had a double chin; and there was\r\nsomething apelike in those bushy grizzled eyebrows of his that vaguely\r\ndisgusted her. He was heavy in his movements, and all the care he took\r\nin his diet and all his exercise did not prevent him from being fat; his\r\nbones were much too well covered and his joints had a middle-aged\r\nstiffness. His smart clothes were a little tight for him and a little\r\ntoo young.\r\n\r\nBut when he came into the drawing-room before luncheon Kitty received\r\nquite a shock (this perhaps was why her pallor had been so marked), for\r\nshe discovered that her imagination had played an odd trick on her: he\r\ndid not in the least look as she had pictured him. She could hardly help\r\nlaughing at herself. His hair was not grey at all, oh, there were a few\r\nwhite hairs on the temple but they were becoming; and his face was not\r\nred, but sunburned; his head was very well placed on his neck; and he\r\nwasn\'t stout and he wasn\'t old: in fact he was almost slim and his\r\nfigure was admirable--could you blame him if he was a trifle vain of\r\nit?--he might have been a young man. And of course he did know how to\r\nwear his clothes; it was absurd to deny that: he looked neat and clean\r\nand trim. Whatever could have possessed her to think him this and that?\r\nHe was a very handsome man. It was lucky that she knew how worthless he\r\nwas. Of course she had always admitted that his voice had a winning\r\nquality, and his voice was exactly as she remembered it: it made the\r\nfalseness of every word he said more exasperating; its richness of tone\r\nand its warmth rang now in her ears with insincerity and she wondered\r\nhow she could ever have been taken in by it. His eyes were beautiful:\r\nthat was where his charm lay, they had such a soft, blue brilliance and\r\neven when he was talking balderdash an expression which was so\r\ndelightful; it was almost impossible not to be moved by them.\r\n\r\nAt last the coffee was brought in and Charlie lit his cheroot. He looked\r\nat his watch and rose from the table.\r\n\r\n"Well, I must leave you two young women to your own devices. It\'s time\r\nfor me to get back to the office." He paused and then with his friendly,\r\ncharming eyes on Kitty said to her: "I\'m not going to bother you for a\r\nday or two till you\'re rested, but then I want to have a little business\r\ntalk with you."\r\n\r\n"With me?"\r\n\r\n"We must make arrangements about your house, you know, and then there\'s\r\nthe furniture."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I can go to a lawyer. There\'s no reason why I should bother you\r\nabout that."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think for a moment I\'m going to let you waste your money on legal\r\nexpenses. I\'m going to see to everything. You know you\'re entitled to a\r\npension: I\'m going to talk to H. E. about it and see if by making\r\nrepresentations in the proper quarter we can\'t get something extra for\r\nyou. You put yourself in my hands. But don\'t bother about anything just\r\nyet. All we want you to do now is to get fit and well: isn\'t that right,\r\nDorothy?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\nHe gave Kitty a little nod and then passing by his wife\'s chair took her\r\nhand and kissed it. Most Englishmen look a little foolish when they kiss\r\na woman\'s hand; he did it with a graceful ease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxiv_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not till Kitty was fairly settled at the Townsends\' that she\r\ndiscovered that she was weary. The comfort and the unaccustomed amenity\r\nof this life broke up the strain under which she had been living. She\r\nhad forgotten how pleasant it was to take one\'s ease, how lulling to be\r\nsurrounded by pretty things, and how agreeable it was to receive\r\nattention. She sank back, with a sigh of relief into the facile\r\nexistence of the luxurious East. It was not displeasing to feel that in\r\na discreet and well-bred fashion she was an object of sympathetic\r\ninterest. Her bereavement was so recent that it was impossible for\r\nentertainments to be given for her, but ladies of consequence in the\r\nColony (His Excellency\'s wife, the wives of the Admiral and of the Chief\r\nJustice) came to drink a quiet cup of tea with her. His Excellency\'s\r\nwife said that His Excellency was most anxious to see her and if she\r\nwould come very quietly to luncheon at Government House ("not a party,\r\nof course, only ourselves and the A.D.C.\'s!"), it would be very nice.\r\nThese ladies used Kitty as though she were a piece of porcelain which\r\nwas as fragile as it was precious. She could not fail to see that they\r\nlooked upon her as a little heroine, and she had sufficient humour to\r\nplay the part with modesty and discretion. She wished sometimes that\r\nWaddington were there; with his malicious shrewdness he would have seen\r\nthe fun of the situation; and when alone they might have had a good\r\nlaugh over it together. Dorothy had had a letter from him, and he had\r\nsaid all manner of things about her devoted work at the convent, about\r\nher courage and her self-control. Of course he was skilfully pulling\r\ntheir legs: the dirty dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxv_\r\n\r\n\r\nKitty did not know whether it was by chance or by design that she never\r\nfound herself for a moment alone with Charlie. His tact was exquisite.\r\nHe remained kindly, sympathetic, pleasant and amiable. No one could have\r\nguessed that they had ever been more than acquaintances. But one\r\nafternoon when she was lying on a sofa outside her room reading he\r\npassed along the verandah and stopped.\r\n\r\n"What is that you\'re reading?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"A book."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with irony. He smiled.\r\n\r\n"Dorothy\'s gone to a garden-party at Government House."\r\n\r\n"I know. Why haven\'t you gone too?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t feel I could face it and I thought I\'d come back and keep you\r\ncompany. The car\'s outside, would you like to come for a drive round the\r\nisland?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you."\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the foot of the sofa on which she lay.\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t had the chance of a talk by ourselves since you got here."\r\n\r\nShe looked straight into his eyes with cool insolence.\r\n\r\n"Do you think we have anything to say to one another?"\r\n\r\n"Volumes."\r\n\r\nShe shifted her feet a little so that she should not touch him.\r\n\r\n"Are you still angry with me?" he asked, the shadow of a smile on his\r\nlips and his eyes melting.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," she laughed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'d laugh if you weren\'t."\r\n\r\n"You\'re mistaken; I despise you much too much to be angry with you."\r\n\r\nHe was unruffled.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re rather hard on me. Looking back calmly, don\'t you\r\nhonestly think I was right?"\r\n\r\n"From your standpoint."\r\n\r\n"Now that you know Dorothy, you must admit she\'s rather nice?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. I shall always be grateful for her great kindness to me."\r\n\r\n"She\'s one in a thousand. I should never have had a moment\'s peace if\r\nwe\'d bolted. It would have been a rotten trick to play on her. And after\r\nall I had to think of my children; it would have been an awful handicap\r\nfor them."\r\n\r\nFor a minute she held him in her reflective gaze. She felt completely\r\nmistress of the situation.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve watched you very carefully during the week I\'ve been here. I\'ve\r\ncome to the conclusion that you really are fond of Dorothy. I should\r\nnever have thought you capable of it."\r\n\r\n"I told you I was fond of her. I wouldn\'t do anything to cause her a\r\nmoment\'s uneasiness. She\'s the best wife a man ever had."\r\n\r\n"Have you never thought that you owed her any loyalty?"\r\n\r\n"What the eye doesn\'t see the heart doesn\'t grieve for," he smiled.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"You\'re despicable."\r\n\r\n"I\'m human. I don\'t know why you should think me such a cad because I\r\nfell head over ears in love with you. I didn\'t particularly want to, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nIt gave her a little twist of the heart-strings to hear him say that.\r\n\r\n"I was fair game," she answered bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Naturally I couldn\'t foresee that we were going to get into such a\r\ndevil of a scrape."\r\n\r\n"And in any case you had a pretty shrewd idea that if anyone suffered it\r\nwouldn\'t be you."\r\n\r\n"I think that\'s a bit thick. After all, now it\'s all over, you must see\r\nI acted for the best for both of us. You lost your head and you ought to\r\nbe jolly glad that I kept mine. Do you think it would have been a\r\nsuccess if I\'d done what you wanted me to? We were dashed uncomfortable\r\nin the frying-pan, but we should have been a damned sight worse off in\r\nthe fire. And you haven\'t come to any harm. Why can\'t we kiss and make\r\nfriends?"\r\n\r\nShe almost laughed.\r\n\r\n"You can hardly expect me to forget that you sent me to almost certain\r\ndeath without a shadow of compunction?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, what nonsense! I told you there was no risk if you took reasonable\r\nprecautions. Do you think I\'d have let you go for a moment if I hadn\'t\r\nbeen perfectly convinced of that?"\r\n\r\n"You were convinced because you wanted to be. You\'re one of those\r\ncowards who only think what it\'s profitable for them to think."\r\n\r\n"Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You have come back,\r\nand if you don\'t mind my saying anything so objectionable you\'ve come\r\nback prettier than ever."\r\n\r\n"And Walter?"\r\n\r\nHe could not resist the facetious answer which came to his mind. Charlie\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n"Nothing suits you so well as black."\r\n\r\nShe stared at him for a moment. Tears filled her eyes and she began to\r\ncry. Her beautiful face was distorted with grief. She did not seek to\r\nhide it, but lay on her back with her hands along her sides.\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake don\'t cry like that. I didn\'t mean to say anything\r\nunkind. It was only a joke. You know how sincerely I feel for you in\r\nyour bereavement."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hold your stupid tongue."\r\n\r\n"I\'d give anything to have Walter back again."\r\n\r\n"He died because of you and me."\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, but she snatched it away from him.\r\n\r\n"Please go away," she sobbed. "That\'s the only thing you can do for me\r\nnow. I hate and despise you. Walter was worth ten of you and I was too\r\nbig a fool to see it. Go away. Go away."\r\n\r\nShe saw he was going to speak again and she sprang to her feet and went\r\ninto her room. He followed her, and as he entered, with instinctive\r\nprudence, drew the shutter so that they were almost in darkness.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t leave you like this," he said, putting his arms round her. "You\r\nknow I didn\'t mean to hurt you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t touch me. For God\'s sake go. Go away."\r\n\r\nShe tried to tear herself from him, but he would not let her. She was\r\ncrying hysterically now.\r\n\r\n"Darling, don\'t you know that I\'ve always loved you," he said in his\r\ndeep, charming voice. "I love you more than ever."\r\n\r\n"How can you tell such lies! Let me go. Damn you, let me go."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be unkind to me, Kitty. I know I\'ve been a brute to you, but\r\nforgive me."\r\n\r\nShe was shaking and sobbing, struggling to get away from him, but the\r\npressure of his arms was strangely comforting. She had so longed to feel\r\nthem round her once more, just once, and all her body trembled. She felt\r\ndreadfully weak. It seemed as though her bones were melting, and the\r\nsorrow she felt for Walter shifted into pity for herself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how could you be so unkind to me?" she sobbed. "Don\'t you know that\r\nI loved you with all my heart. No one has ever loved you as I loved\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Darling."\r\n\r\nHe began to kiss her.\r\n\r\n"No, no," she cried.\r\n\r\nHe sought her face, but she turned it away; he sought her lips; she did\r\nnot know what he was saying, broken, passionate words of love; and his\r\narms held her so firmly that she felt like a child that has been lost\r\nand now at last is safe at home. She moaned faintly. Her eyes were\r\nclosed and her face was wet with tears. And then he found her lips and\r\nthe pressure of his upon them shot through her body like the flame of\r\nGod. It was an ecstasy and she was burnt to a cinder and she glowed as\r\nthough she were transfigured. In her dreams, in her dreams she had known\r\nthis rapture. What was he doing with her now? She did not know. She was\r\nnot a woman, her personality was dissolved, she was nothing but desire.\r\nHe lifted her off her feet, she was very light in his arms, he carried\r\nher and she clung to him, desperate and adoring; her head sank on the\r\npillow and his lips clung to hers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxvi_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sat on the edge of the bed hiding her face with her hands.\r\n\r\n"Would you like a drop of water?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. He went over to the washing stand, filled the\r\ntooth-glass and brought it to her.\r\n\r\n"Come along, have a little drink and you\'ll feel better."\r\n\r\nHe put the glass to her lips and she sipped the water. Then, with\r\nhorrified eyes, she stared at him. He was standing over her, looking\r\ndown, and in his eyes was a twinkle of self-satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Well, do you think I\'m such a dirty dog as you did?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe looked down.\r\n\r\n"Yes. But I know that I\'m not a bit better than you. Oh, I\'m so\r\nashamed."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think you\'re very ungrateful."\r\n\r\n"Will you go now?"\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth I think it\'s about time. I\'ll just go and tidy\r\nmyself up before Dorothy comes in."\r\n\r\nHe went out of the room with a jaunty step.\r\n\r\nKitty sat for a while, still on the edge of the bed, hunched up like an\r\nimbecile. Her mind was vacant. A shudder passed through her. She\r\nstaggered to her feet and, going to the dressing-table, sank into a\r\nchair. She stared at herself in the glass. Her eyes were swollen with\r\ntears; her face was stained and there was a red mark on one cheek where\r\nhis had rested. She looked at herself with horror. It was the same face.\r\nShe had expected in it she knew not what change of degradation.\r\n\r\n"Swine," she flung at her reflection. "Swine."\r\n\r\nThen, letting her face fall on her arms, she wept bitterly. Shame,\r\nshame! She did not know what had come over her. It was horrible. She\r\nhated him and she hated herself. It had been ecstasy. Oh, hateful! She\r\ncould never look him in the face again. He was so justified. He had been\r\nright not to marry her, for she was worthless; she was no better than a\r\nharlot. Oh, worse, for those poor women gave themselves for bread. And\r\nin this house too into which Dorothy had taken her in her sorrow and\r\ncruel desolation! Her shoulders shook with her sobs. Everything was gone\r\nnow. She had thought herself changed, she had thought herself strong,\r\nshe thought she had returned to Tching-Yen a woman who possessed\r\nherself; new ideas flitted about her heart like little yellow\r\nbutterflies in the sunshine and she had hoped to be so much better in\r\nthe future; freedom like a spirit of light had beckoned her on, and the\r\nworld was like a spacious plain through which she could walk light of\r\nfoot and with head erect. She had thought herself free from lust and\r\nvile passions, free to live the clean and healthy life of the spirit;\r\nshe had likened herself to the white egrets that fly with leisurely\r\nflight across the rice fields at dusk and they are like the soaring\r\nthoughts of a mind at rest with itself; and she was a slave. Weak, weak!\r\nIt was hopeless, it was no good to try, she was a slut.\r\n\r\nShe would not go in to dinner. She sent the boy to tell Dorothy that she\r\nhad a headache and preferred to remain in her room. Dorothy came in and,\r\nseeing her red, swollen eyes, talked for a little in her gentle,\r\ncommiserating way of trivial things. Kitty knew that Dorothy thought she\r\nhad been crying on account of Walter and, sympathising like the good and\r\nloving wife she was, respected the natural sorrow.\r\n\r\n"I know it\'s very hard, dear," she said as she left Kitty. "But you must\r\ntry to have courage. I\'m sure your dear husband wouldn\'t wish you to\r\ngrieve for him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxvii_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut next morning Kitty rose early and leaving a note for Dorothy to say\r\nthat she was gone out on business took a tram down the hill. She made\r\nher way through the crowded streets with their motor cars, rickshaws and\r\nchairs, and the motley throng of Europeans and Chinese, to the offices\r\nof the P. & O. Company. A ship was sailing in two days, the first ship\r\nout of the port, and she had made up her mind that at all costs she must\r\ngo on it. When the clerk told her that every berth was booked she asked\r\nto see the chief agent. She sent in her name and the agent, whom she had\r\nmet before, came out to fetch her into his office. He knew her\r\ncircumstances and when she told him what she wished he sent for the\r\npassenger list. He looked at it with perplexity.\r\n\r\n"I beseech you to do what you can for me," she urged him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there\'s any one in the Colony who wouldn\'t do anything in\r\nthe world for you, Mrs. Fane," he answered.\r\n\r\nHe sent for a clerk and made enquiries. Then he nodded.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to shift one or two people. I know you want to get home and I\r\nthink we ought to do our best for you. I can give you a little cabin to\r\nyourself. I expect you\'d prefer that."\r\n\r\nShe thanked him. She left him with an elated heart. Flight: that was her\r\nonly thought. Flight! She sent a cable to her father to announce her\r\nimmediate return; she had already cabled to him to say that Walter was\r\ndead; and then went back again to the Townsends\' to tell Dorothy what she\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\n"We shall be dreadfully sorry to lose you," the kind creature said, "but\r\nof course I understand that you want to be with your mother and father."\r\n\r\nSince her return to Tching-Yen Kitty had hesitated from day to day to go\r\nto her house. She dreaded entering it again and meeting face to face the\r\nrecollections with which it was peopled. But now she had no alternative.\r\nTownsend had arranged for the sale of the furniture and he had found\r\nsome one eager to take on the lease, but there were all her clothes and\r\nWalter\'s, for they had taken next to nothing to Mei-tan-fu, and there\r\nwere books, photographs, and various odds and ends. Kitty, indifferent\r\nto everything and anxious to cut herself off completely from the past,\r\nrealised that it would outrage the susceptibilities of the Colony if she\r\nallowed these things to go with the rest to an auction-room. They must\r\nbe packed and sent to her. So after tiffin she prepared to go to the\r\nhouse. Dorothy, eager to give her help, offered to accompany her, but\r\nKitty begged to be allowed to go alone. She agreed that two of Dorothy\'s\r\nboys should come and assist in the packing.\r\n\r\nThe house had been left in charge of the head boy and he opened the door\r\nfor Kitty. It was curious to go into her own house as though she were a\r\nstranger. It was neat and clean. Everything was in its place, ready for\r\nher use, but although the day was warm and sunny there was about the\r\nsilent rooms a chill and desolate air. The furniture was stiffly\r\narranged, exactly where it should be, and the vases which should have\r\nheld flowers were in their places; the book which Kitty had laid face\r\ndownwards she did not remember when still lay face downwards. It was as\r\nthough the house had been left empty but a minute before and yet that\r\nminute was fraught with eternity so that you could not imagine that ever\r\nagain that house would echo with talk and resound with laughter. On the\r\npiano the open music of a foxtrot seemed to wait to be played, but you\r\nhad a feeling that if you struck the keys no sound would come. Walter\'s\r\nroom was as tidy as when he was there. On the chest of drawers were two\r\nlarge photographs of Kitty, one in her presentation dress and one in her\r\nwedding-gown.\r\n\r\nBut the boys fetched up the trunks from the box-room and she stood over\r\nthem watching them pack. They packed neatly and quickly. Kitty reflected\r\nthat in the two days she had it would be easy to get everything done.\r\nShe must not let herself think; she had no time for that. Suddenly she\r\nheard a step behind her and turning round saw Charles Townsend. She felt\r\na sudden chill at her heart.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Will you come into your sitting-room? I have something to say to you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very busy."\r\n\r\n"I shall only keep you five minutes."\r\n\r\nShe said no more, but with a word to the boys to go on with what they\r\nwere doing, preceded Charles into the next room. She did not sit down,\r\nin order to show him that she expected him not to detain her. She knew\r\nthat she was very pale and her heart was beating fast, but she faced him\r\ncoolly, with hostile eyes.\r\n\r\n"What is it you want?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just heard from Dorothy that you\'re going the day after to-morrow.\r\nShe told me that you\'d come here to do your packing and she asked me to\r\nring up and find out if there was anything I could do for you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m grateful to you, but I can manage quite well by myself."\r\n\r\n"So I imagined. I didn\'t come here to ask you that. I came to ask if\r\nyour sudden departure is due to what happened yesterday."\r\n\r\n"You and Dorothy have been very good to me. I didn\'t wish you to think I\r\nwas taking advantage of your good nature."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not a very straight answer."\r\n\r\n"What does it matter to you?"\r\n\r\n"It matters a great deal. I shouldn\'t like to think that anything I\'d\r\ndone had driven you away."\r\n\r\nShe was standing at the table. She looked down. Her eyes fell on the\r\n_Sketch_. It was months old now. It was that paper which Walter had\r\nstared at all through the terrible evening when--and Walter now\r\nwas. . . . She raised her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I feel absolutely degraded. You can\'t possibly despise me as much as I\r\ndespise myself."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t despise you. I meant every word that I said yesterday.\r\nWhat\'s the good of running away like this? I don\'t know why we can\'t be\r\ngood friends. I hate the idea of your thinking I\'ve treated you badly."\r\n\r\n"Why couldn\'t you leave me alone?"\r\n\r\n"Hang it all, I\'m not a stick or a stone. It\'s so unreasonable, the way\r\nyou look at it; it\'s so morbid. I thought after yesterday you\'d feel a\r\nlittle more kindly to me. After all, we\'re only human."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel human. I feel like an animal. A pig or a rabbit or a dog.\r\nOh, I don\'t blame you, I was just as bad. I yielded to you because I\r\nwanted you. But it wasn\'t me, it wasn\'t the real me. I\'m not that\r\nhateful, beastly, lustful woman. I disown her. It wasn\'t me that lay on\r\nthat bed panting for you when my husband was hardly cold in his grave\r\nand your wife had been so kind to me, so indescribably kind. It was only\r\nthe animal in me, dark and fearful like an evil spirit, and I disown,\r\nand hate, and despise it. And ever since, when I\'ve thought of it, my\r\ngorge rises and I feel that I must vomit."\r\n\r\nHe frowned a little and gave a short, uneasy snigger.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m fairly broadminded, but sometimes you say things that\r\npositively shock me."\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry to do that. You\'d better go now. You\'re a very\r\nunimportant little man and I\'m silly to talk to you seriously."\r\n\r\nHe did not answer for a while and she saw by the shadow in his blue eyes\r\nthat he was angry with her. He would heave a sigh of relief when,\r\ntactful and courteous as ever, he had finally seen her off. It amused\r\nher to think of the politeness with which, while they shook hands and he\r\nwished her a pleasant journey, she would thank him for his hospitality.\r\nBut she saw his expression change.\r\n\r\n"Dorothy tells me you\'re going to have a baby," he said.\r\n\r\nShe felt herself colour, but she allowed no gesture to escape her.\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\n"Am I by any chance the father?"\r\n\r\n"No, no. It\'s Walter\'s child."\r\n\r\nShe spoke with an emphasis which she could not prevent, but even as she\r\nspoke she knew that it was not the tone with which to carry conviction.\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure?" He was now roguishly smiling. "After all, you were\r\nmarried to Walter a couple of years and nothing happened. The dates seem\r\nto fit all right. I think it\'s much more likely to be mine than\r\nWalter\'s."\r\n\r\n"I would rather kill myself than have a child of yours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now, that\'s nonsense. I should be awfully pleased and proud.\r\nI\'d like it to be a girl, you know. I\'ve only had boys with Dorothy. You\r\nwon\'t be able to be in doubt very long, you know: my three kiddies are\r\nabsolutely the living image of me."\r\n\r\nHe had regained his good humour and she knew why. If the child was his,\r\nthough she might never see him again, she could never entirely escape\r\nhim. His power over her would reach out and he would still, obscurely\r\nbut definitely, influence every day of her life.\r\n\r\n"You really are the most vain and fatuous ass that it\'s ever been my bad\r\nluck to run across," she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxviii_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the ship steamed into Marseilles Kitty, looking at the rugged and\r\nbeautiful outline of the coast glowing in the sunlight, on a sudden\r\ncaught sight of the golden statue of the Blessed Virgin which stands\r\nupon the church of Sainte Marie de la Grace as a symbol of safety to the\r\nmariner at sea. She remembered how the Sisters of the convent at\r\nMei-tan-fu, leaving their own land for ever, had knelt as the figure\r\nfaded in the distance so that it was no more than a little golden flame\r\nin the blue sky and sought in prayer to allay the pang of separation.\r\nShe clasped her hands in supplication to what power she knew not.\r\n\r\nDuring the long, quiet journey she had thought incessantly of the\r\nhorrible thing that had happened to her. She could not understand\r\nherself. It was so unexpected. What was it that had seized her, so that,\r\ndespising him, despising him with all her heart, she had yielded\r\npassionately to Charlie\'s foul embrace? Rage filled her and disgust of\r\nherself obsessed her. She felt that she could never forget her\r\nhumiliation. She wept. But as the distance from Tching-Yen increased she\r\nfound that she was insensibly losing the vividness of her resentment.\r\nWhat had happened seemed to have happened in another world. She was like\r\na person who has been stricken with sudden madness and recovering is\r\ndistressed and ashamed at the grotesque things he vaguely remembers to\r\nhave done when he was not himself. But because he knows he was not\r\nhimself he feels that in his own eyes at least he can claim indulgence.\r\nKitty thought that perhaps a generous heart might pity rather than\r\ncondemn her. But she sighed as she thought how woefully her\r\nself-confidence had been shattered. The way had seemed to stretch before\r\nher straight and easy and now she saw that it was a tortuous way and\r\nthat pitfalls awaited her. The vast spaces and the tragic and beautiful\r\nsunsets of the Indian Ocean rested her. She seemed borne then to some\r\ncountry where she might in freedom possess her soul. If she could only\r\nregain her self-respect at the cost of a bitter conflict, well, she must\r\nfind the courage to affront it.\r\n\r\nThe future was lonely and difficult. At Port Said she had received a\r\nletter from her mother in answer to her cable. It was a long letter\r\nwritten in the large and fanciful writing which was taught to young\r\nladies in her mother\'s youth. Its ornateness was so neat that it gave\r\nyou an impression of insincerity. Mrs. Garstin expressed her regret at\r\nWalter\'s death and sympathised properly with her daughter\'s grief. She\r\nfeared that Kitty was left inadequately provided for, but naturally the\r\nColonial Office would give her a pension. She was glad to know that\r\nKitty was coming back to England and of course she must come and stay\r\nwith her father and mother till her child was born. Then followed\r\ncertain instructions that Kitty must be sure to follow and various\r\ndetails of her sister Doris\'s confinement. The little boy weighed so and\r\nso much and his paternal grandfather said he had never seen a finer\r\nchild. Doris was expecting again and they hoped for another boy in order\r\nto make the succession to the baronetcy quite sure.\r\n\r\nKitty saw that the point of the letter lay in the definite date set for\r\nthe invitation. Mrs. Garstin had no intention of being saddled with a\r\nwidowed daughter in modest circumstances. It was singular, when she\r\nreflected how her mother had idolised her, that now, disappointed in\r\nher, she found her merely a nuisance. How strange was the relation\r\nbetween parents and children! When they were small the parents doted on\r\nthem, passed through agonies of apprehension at each childish ailment,\r\nand the children clung to their parents with love and adoration; a few\r\nyears passed, the children grew up, and persons not of their kin were\r\nmore important to their happiness than father or mother. Indifference\r\ndisplaced the blind and instinctive love of the past. Their meetings\r\nwere a source of boredom and irritation. Distracted once at the thought\r\nof a month\'s separation they were able now to look forward with\r\nequanimity to being parted for years. Her mother need not worry: as soon\r\nas she could she would make herself a home of her own. But she must have\r\na little time; at present everything was vague and she could not form\r\nany picture of the future: perhaps she would die at childbirth; that\r\nwould be a solution of many difficulties.\r\n\r\nBut when they docked two letters were handed to her. She was surprised\r\nto recognise her father\'s writing: she did not remember that he had ever\r\nwritten to her. He was not effusive, and began: dear Kitty. He told her\r\nthat he was writing instead of her mother who had not been well and was\r\nobliged to go into a nursing home to have an operation. Kitty was not to\r\nbe frightened and was to keep to her intention of going round by sea; it\r\nwas much more expensive to come across by land and with her mother away\r\nit would be inconvenient for Kitty to stay at the house in Harrington\r\nGardens. The other was from Doris; it started: Kitty darling, not\r\nbecause Doris had any particular affection for her, but because it was\r\nher way thus to address every one she knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kitty darling_,\r\n\r\n_I expect Father has written to you. Mother has got to have an\r\noperation. It appears that she has been rotten for the last year, but\r\nyou know she hates doctors and she\'s been taking all sorts of patent\r\nmedicines. I don\'t quite know what\'s the matter with her as she insists\r\non making a secret of the whole thing and flies into a passion if you\r\nask her questions. She has been looking simply awful and if I were you I\r\nthink I\'d get off at Marseilles and come back as quick as you can. But\r\ndon\'t let on that I told you to come as she pretends there\'s nothing\r\nmuch the matter with her and she doesn\'t want you to get here till she\'s\r\nback at home. She\'s made the doctors promise that she shall be moved in\r\na week. Best love._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Doris._\r\n\r\n\r\n_I\'m awfully sorry about Walter. You must have had a hell of a time,\r\npoor darling. I\'m simply dying to see you. It\'s rather funny our both\r\nhaving babies together. We shall be able to hold one another\'s hands._\r\n\r\n\r\nKitty lost in reflection, stood for a little while on the deck. She\r\ncould not imagine her mother ill. She never remembered to have seen her\r\nother than active and resolute; she had always been impatient of other\r\npeople\'s ailments. Then a steward came up to her with a telegram.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deeply regret to inform you that your mother died this morning.\r\nFather._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxix_\r\n\r\n\r\nKitty rang the bell at the house in Harrington Gardens. She was told\r\nthat her father was in his study and going to the door she opened it\r\nsoftly: he was sitting by the fire reading the last edition of the\r\nevening paper. He looked up as she entered, put down the paper, and\r\nsprang nervously to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Kitty, I didn\'t expect you till the later train."\r\n\r\n"I thought you wouldn\'t want the bother of coming to meet me so I didn\'t\r\nwire the time I expected to arrive."\r\n\r\nHe gave her his cheek to kiss in the manner she so well remembered.\r\n\r\n"I was just having a look at the paper," he said. "I haven\'t read the\r\npaper for the last two days."\r\n\r\nShe saw that he thought it needed some explanation if he occupied\r\nhimself with the ordinary affairs of life.\r\n\r\n"Of course," she said. "You must be tired out. I\'m afraid mother\'s death\r\nhas been a great shock to you."\r\n\r\nHe was older, and thinner than when she had last seen him. A little,\r\nlined, dried-up man, with a precise manner.\r\n\r\n"The surgeon said there had never been any hope. She hadn\'t been herself\r\nfor more than a year, but she refused to see a doctor. The surgeon told\r\nme that she must have been in constant pain, he said it was a miracle\r\nthat she had been able to endure it."\r\n\r\n"Did she never complain?"\r\n\r\n"She said she wasn\'t very well. But she never complained of pain." He\r\npaused and looked at Kitty. "Are you very tired after your journey?"\r\n\r\n"Not very."\r\n\r\n"Would you like to go up and see her?"\r\n\r\n"Is she here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she was brought here from the nursing home."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll go now."\r\n\r\n"Would you like me to come with you?"\r\n\r\nThere was something in her father\'s tone that made her look at him\r\nquickly. His face was slightly turned from her; he did not want her to\r\ncatch his eye. Kitty had acquired of late a singular proficiency at\r\nreading the thoughts of others. After all, day after day she had applied\r\nall her sensibilities to divine from a casual word or an unguarded\r\ngesture the hidden thoughts of her husband. She guessed at once what her\r\nfather was trying to hide from her. It was relief he felt, an infinite\r\nrelief, and he was frightened of himself. For hard on thirty years he\r\nhad been a good and faithful husband, he had never uttered a single word\r\nin dispraise of his wife, and now he should grieve for her. He had\r\nalways done the things that were expected of him. It would have been\r\nshocking to him by the flicker of an eyelid or by the smallest hint to\r\nbetray that he did not feel what under the circumstances a bereaved\r\nhusband should feel.\r\n\r\n"No, I would rather go by myself," said Kitty.\r\n\r\nShe went upstairs and into the large, cold and pretentious bedroom in\r\nwhich her mother for so many years had slept. She remembered so well\r\nthose massive pieces of mahogany and the engravings after Marcus Stone\r\nwhich adorned the walls. The things on the dressing-table were arranged\r\nwith the stiff precision which Mrs. Garstin had all her life insisted\r\nupon. The flowers looked out of place; Mrs. Garstin would have thought\r\nit silly, affected and unhealthy to have flowers in her bedroom. Their\r\nperfume did not cover that acrid, musty smell, as of freshly washed\r\nlinen, which Kitty remembered as characteristic of her mother\'s room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garstin lay on the bed, her hands folded across her breast with a\r\nmeekness which in life she would have had no patience with. With her\r\nstrong sharp features, the cheeks hollow with suffering and the temples\r\nsunken, she looked handsome and even imposing. Death had robbed her face\r\nof its meanness and left only an impression of character. She might have\r\nbeen a Roman empress. It was strange to Kitty that of the dead persons\r\nshe had seen this was the only one who in death seemed to preserve a\r\nlook as though that clay had been once a habitation of the spirit. Grief\r\nshe could not feel, for there had been too much bitterness between her\r\nmother and herself to leave in her heart any deep feeling of affection;\r\nand looking back on the girl she had been she knew that it was her\r\nmother who had made her what she was. But when she looked at that hard,\r\ndomineering and ambitious woman who lay there so still and silent with\r\nall her petty aims frustrated by death, she was aware of a vague pathos.\r\nShe had schemed and intrigued all her life and never had she desired\r\nanything but what was base and unworthy. Kitty wondered whether perhaps\r\nin some other sphere she looked upon her earthly course with\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\nDoris came in.\r\n\r\n"I thought you\'d come by this train. I felt I must look in for a moment.\r\nIsn\'t it dreadful? Poor darling mother."\r\n\r\nBursting into tears, she flung herself into Kitty\'s arms. Kitty kissed\r\nher. She knew how her mother had neglected Doris in favour of her and\r\nhow harsh she had been with her because she was plain and dull. She\r\nwondered whether Doris really felt the extravagant grief she showed. But\r\nDoris had always been emotional. She wished she could cry: Doris would\r\nthink her dreadfully hard. Kitty felt that she had been through too much\r\nto feign a distress she did not feel.\r\n\r\n"Would you like to come and see father?" she asked her when the strength\r\nof the outburst had somewhat subsided.\r\n\r\nDoris wiped her eyes. Kitty noticed that her sister\'s pregnancy had\r\nblunted her features and in her black dress she looked gross and blousy.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think I will. I shall only cry again. Poor old thing, he\'s\r\nbearing it wonderfully."\r\n\r\nKitty showed her sister out of the house and then went back to her\r\nfather. He was standing in front of the fire and the newspaper was\r\nneatly folded. He wanted her to see that he had not been reading it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t dressed for dinner," he said. "I didn\'t think it was\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_lxxx_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey dined. Mr. Garstin gave Kitty the details of his wife\'s illness and\r\ndeath, and he told her the kindness of the friends who had written\r\n(there were piles of sympathetic letters on his table and he sighed when\r\nhe considered the burden of answering them) and the arrangements he had\r\nmade for the funeral. Then they went back into his study. This was the\r\nonly room in the house which had a fire. He mechanically took from the\r\nchimney-piece his pipe and began to fill it, but he gave his daughter a\r\ndoubtful look and put it down.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to smoke?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Your mother didn\'t very much like the smell of a pipe after dinner and\r\nsince the war I\'ve given up cigars."\r\n\r\nHis answer gave Kitty a little pang. It seemed dreadful that a man of\r\nsixty should hesitate to smoke what he wanted in his own study.\r\n\r\n"I like the smell of a pipe," she smiled.\r\n\r\nA faint look of relief crossed his face and taking his pipe once more he\r\nlit it. They sat opposite one another on each side of the fire. He felt\r\nthat he must talk to Kitty of her own troubles.\r\n\r\n"You received the letter your mother wrote to you to Port Said, I\r\nsuppose. The news of poor Walter\'s death was a great shock to both of\r\nus. I thought him a very nice fellow."\r\n\r\nKitty did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n"Your mother told me that you were going to have a baby."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"When do you expect it?"\r\n\r\n"In about four months."\r\n\r\n"It will be a great consolation to you. You must go and see Doris\'s boy.\r\nHe\'s a fine little fellow."\r\n\r\nThey were talking more distantly than if they were strangers who had\r\njust met, for if they had been he would have been interested in her just\r\nbecause of that, and curious, but their common past was a wall of\r\nindifference between them. Kitty knew too well that she had done nothing\r\nto beget her father\'s affection, he had never counted in the house and\r\nhad been taken for granted, the bread-winner who was a little despised\r\nbecause he could provide no more luxuriously for his family; but she had\r\ntaken for granted that he loved her just because he was her father, and\r\nit was a shock to discover that his heart was empty of feeling for her.\r\nShe had known that they were all bored by him, but it had never occurred\r\nto her that he was equally bored by them. He was as ever kind and\r\nsubdued, but the sad perspicacity which she had learnt in suffering\r\nsuggested to her that, though he had probably never acknowledged it to\r\nhimself and never would, in his heart he disliked her.\r\n\r\nHis pipe was not drawing and he rose to find something to poke it with.\r\nPerhaps it was an excuse to hide his nervousness.\r\n\r\n"Your mother wished you to stay here till your baby was born and she was\r\ngoing to have your old room got ready for you."\r\n\r\n"I know. I promise you I won\'t be a bother."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s not that. Under the circumstances it was evident that the only\r\nplace for you to come to was your father\'s house. But the fact is that\r\nI\'ve just been offered the post of Chief Justice of the Bahamas and I\r\nhave accepted it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, I\'m so glad. I congratulate you with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"The offer arrived too late for me to tell your poor mother. It would\r\nhave given her a great satisfaction."\r\n\r\nThe bitter irony of fate! After all her efforts, intrigues and\r\nhumiliations, Mrs. Garstin had died without knowing that her ambition,\r\nhowever modified by past disappointments, was at last achieved.\r\n\r\n"I am sailing early next month. Of course this house will be put in the\r\nagent\'s hands and my intention was to sell the furniture. I\'m sorry that\r\nI shan\'t be able to have you to stay here, but if you\'d like any of the\r\nfurniture to furnish a flat I shall be extremely pleased to give it\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nKitty looked into the fire. Her heart beat quickly; it was curious that\r\non a sudden she should be so nervous. But at last she forced herself to\r\nspeak. In her voice was a little tremor.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t I come with you, father?"\r\n\r\n"You? Oh, my dear Kitty." His face fell. She had often heard the\r\nexpression, but thought it only a phrase, and now for the first time in\r\nher life she saw the movement that it described. It was so marked that\r\nit startled her. "But all your friends are here and Doris is here. I\r\nshould have thought you\'d be much happier if you took a flat in London.\r\nI don\'t exactly know what your circumstances are, but I shall be very\r\nglad to pay the rent of it."\r\n\r\n"I have enough money to live on."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to a strange place. I know nothing of the conditions."\r\n\r\n"I\'m used to strange places. London means nothing to me any more. I\r\ncouldn\'t breathe here."\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes for a moment and she thought he was going to cry. His\r\nface bore an expression of utter misery. It wrung her heart. She had\r\nbeen right; the death of his wife had filled him with relief and now\r\nthis chance to break entirely with the past had offered him freedom. He\r\nhad seen a new life spread before him and at last after all these years\r\nrest and the mirage of happiness. She saw dimly all the suffering that\r\nhad preyed on his heart for thirty years. At last he opened his eyes. He\r\ncould not prevent the sigh that escaped him.\r\n\r\n"Of course if you wish to come I shall be very pleased."\r\n\r\nIt was pitiful. The struggle had been short and he had surrendered to\r\nhis sense of duty. With those few words he abandoned all his hopes. She\r\nrose from her chair and going over to him knelt down and seized his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"No, father, I won\'t come unless you want me. You\'ve sacrificed yourself\r\nenough. If you want to go alone, go. Don\'t think of me for a minute."\r\n\r\nHe released one of his hands and stroked her pretty hair.\r\n\r\n"Of course I want you, my dear. After all I\'m your father and you\'re a\r\nwidow and alone. If you want to be with me it would be very unkind of me\r\nnot to want you."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s just it, I make no claims on you because I\'m your daughter,\r\nyou owe me nothing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear child."\r\n\r\n"Nothing," she repeated vehemently. "My heart sinks when I think how\r\nwe\'ve battened on you all our lives and have given you nothing in\r\nreturn. Not even a little affection. I\'m afraid you\'ve not had a very\r\nhappy life. Won\'t you let me try to make up a little for all I\'ve failed\r\nto do in the past?"\r\n\r\nHe frowned a little. Her emotion embarrassed him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean. I\'ve never had any complaint to make of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, I\'ve been through so much, I\'ve been so unhappy. I\'m not\r\nthe Kitty I was when I went away. I\'m terribly weak, but I don\'t think\r\nI\'m the filthy cad I was then. Won\'t you give me a chance? I have nobody\r\nbut you in the world now. Won\'t you let me try to make you love me? Oh,\r\nfather, I\'m so lonely and so miserable; I want your love so badly."\r\n\r\nShe buried her face in his lap and cried as though her heart were\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Kitty, my little Kitty," he murmured.\r\n\r\nShe looked up and put her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, be kind to me. Let us be kind to one another."\r\n\r\nHe kissed her, on the lips as a lover might, and his cheeks were wet\r\nwith her tears.\r\n\r\n"Of course you shall come with me."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to? Do you really want me to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so grateful to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, don\'t say things like that to me. It makes me feel quite\r\nawkward."\r\n\r\nHe took out his handkerchief and dried her eyes. He smiled in a way that\r\nshe had never seen him smile before. Once more she threw her arms round\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have such a lark, father dear. You don\'t know what fun we\'re\r\ngoing to have together."\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t forgotten that you\'re going to have a baby."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad she\'ll be born out there within sound of the sea and under a\r\nwide blue sky."\r\n\r\n"Have you already made up your mind about the sex?" he murmured, with\r\nhis thin, dry smile.\r\n\r\n"I want a girl because I want to bring her up so that she shan\'t make\r\nthe mistakes I\'ve made. When I look back upon the girl I was I hate\r\nmyself. But I never had a chance. I\'m going to bring up my daughter so\r\nthat she\'s free and can stand on her own feet. I\'m not going to bring a\r\nchild into the world, and love her, and bring her up, just so that some\r\nman may want to sleep with her so much that he\'s willing to provide her\r\nwith board and lodging for the rest of her life."\r\n\r\nShe felt her father stiffen. He had never spoken of such things and it\r\nshocked him to hear these words in his daughter\'s mouth.\r\n\r\n"Let me be frank just this once, father. I\'ve been foolish and wicked\r\nand hateful. I\'ve been terribly punished. I\'m determined to save my\r\ndaughter from all that. I want her to be fearless and frank. I want her\r\nto be a person, independent of others because she is possessed of\r\nherself, and I want her to take life like a free man and make a better\r\njob of it than I have."\r\n\r\n"Why, my love, you talk as though you were fifty. You\'ve got all your\r\nlife before you. You mustn\'t be downhearted."\r\n\r\nKitty shook her head and slowly smiled.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not. I have hope and courage. The past is finished; let the dead\r\nbury their dead. It\'s all uncertain, life and whatever is to come to me,\r\nbut I enter upon it with a light and buoyant heart. It\'s all confused,\r\nbut vaguely I discern a pattern, and I see before me an inexhaustible\r\nrichness, the mystery and the strangeness of everything, compassion and\r\ncharity, the Way and the Wayfarer, and perhaps in the end--God."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PAINTED VEIL ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
