A SOIR\xc3\x89E AT FORT RELIANCE. On the evening of the 17th March\r\n1859, Captain Craventy gave a f\xc3\xaate at Fort Reliance. Our readers must\r\nnot at once imagine a grand entertainment, such as a court ball, or a\r\nmusical soir\xc3\xa9e with a fine orchestra. Captain Craventy\xe2\x80\x99s reception\r\nwas a very simple affair, yet he had spared no pains to give it \xc3\xa9clat.\r\n\r\nIn fact, under the auspices of Corporal Joliffe, the large room on the\r\nground-floor was completely transformed. The rough walls, constructed of\r\nroughly-hewn trunks of trees piled up horizontally, were still visible,\r\nit is true, but their nakedness was disguised by arms and armour,\r\nborrowed from the arsenal of the fort, and by an English tent at each\r\ncorner of the room. Two lamps suspended by chains, like chandeliers,\r\nand provided with tin reflectors, relieved the gloomy appearance of the\r\nblackened beams of the ceiling, and sufficiently illuminated the\r\nmisty atmosphere of the room. The narrow windows, some of them mere\r\nloop-holes, were so encrusted with hoar-frost, that it was impossible\r\nto look through them; but two or three pieces of red bunting, tastily\r\narranged about them, challenged the admiration of all who entered. The\r\nfloor, of rough joists of wood laid parallel with each other, had been\r\ncarefully swept by Corporal Joliffe. No sofas, chairs, or other modern\r\nfurniture, impeded the free circulation of the guests. Wooden benches\r\nhalf fixed against the walls, huge blocks of wood cut with the axe,\r\nand two tables with clumsy legs, were all the appliances of luxury\r\nthe saloon could boast of. But the partition wall, with a narrow door\r\nleading into the next room, was decorated in a style alike costly and\r\npicturesque. From the beams hung magnificent furs admirably arranged,\r\nthe equal of which could not be seen in the more favoured regions of\r\nRegent Street or the Perspective-Newski. It seemed as if the whole fauna\r\nof the ice-bound North were here represented by their finest skins. The\r\neye wandered from the furs of wolves, grey bears, polar bears, otters,\r\nwolverenes, beavers, muskrats, water pole-cats, ermines, and silver\r\nfoxes; and above this display was an inscription in brilliantly-coloured\r\nand artistically shaped cardboard\xe2\x80\x94the motto of the world-famous\r\nHudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPROPELLE CUTUM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Corporal Joliffe, you have surpassed yourself !\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCaptain Craventy to his subordinate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I have, I think I have !\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Corporal; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nhonour to whom honour is due, Mrs Joliffe deserves part of your\r\ncommendation; she assisted me in everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wonderful woman, Corporal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer equal is not to be found, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn immense brick and earthenware stove occupied the centre of the\r\nroom, with a huge iron pipe passing from it through the ceiling,\r\nand conducting the dense black smoke into the outer air. This stove\r\ncontained a roaring fire constantly fed with fresh shovelfuls of coal by\r\nthe stoker, an old soldier specially appointed to the service. Now and\r\nthen a gust of wind drove back a volume of smoke into the room, dimming\r\nthe brightness of the lamps, and adding fresh blackness to the beams of\r\nthe ceiling, whilst tongues of flame shot forth from the stove. But the\r\nguests of Fort Reliance thought little of this slight inconvenience; the\r\nstove warmed them, and they could not pay too dearly for its cheering\r\nheat, so terribly cold was it outside in the cutting north wind.\r\n\r\nThe storm could be heard raging without, the snow fell fast, becoming\r\nrapidly solid and coating the already frosted window panes with fresh\r\nice. The whistling wind made its way through the cranks and chinks of\r\nthe doors and windows, and occasionally the rattling noise drowned every\r\nother sound. Presently an awful silence ensued. Nature seemed to be\r\ntaking breath; but suddenly the squall recommenced with terrific fury.\r\nThe house was shaken to its foundations, the planks cracked, the beams\r\ngroaned. A stranger less accustomed than the habitu\xc3\xa9s of the fort to\r\nthe war of the elements, would have asked if the end of the world were\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nBut, with two exceptions, Captain Craventy\xe2\x80\x99s guests troubled\r\nthemselves little about the weather, and if they had been outside\r\nthey would have felt no more fear than the stormy petrels disporting\r\nthemselves in the midst of the tempest. Two only of the assembled\r\ncompany did not belong to the ordinary society of the neighbourhood,\r\ntwo women, whom we shall introduce when we have enumerated Captain\r\nCraventy\xe2\x80\x99s other guests: these were, Lieutenant Jaspar Hobson,\r\nSergeant Long, Corporal Joliffe, and his bright active Canadian wife,\r\na certain Mac-Nab and his wife, both Scotch, John Rae, married to an\r\nIndian woman of the country, and some sixty soldiers or employ\xc3\xa9s of\r\nthe Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company. The neighbouring forts also furnished their\r\ncontingent of guests, for in these remote lands people look upon each\r\nother as neighbours although their homes may be a hundred miles apart.\r\nA good many employ\xc3\xa9s or traders came from Fort Providence or Fort\r\nResolution, of the Great Slave Lake district, and even from Fort\r\nChippeway and Fort Liard further south. A rare break like this in the\r\nmonotony of their secluded lives, in these hyberborean regions, was\r\njoyfully welcomed by all the exiles, and even a few Indian chiefs, about\r\na dozen, had accepted Captain Craventy\xe2\x80\x99s invitation. They were not,\r\nhowever, accompanied by their wives, the luckless squaws being still\r\nlooked upon as little better than slaves. The presence of these natives\r\nis accounted for by the fact that they are in constant intercourse with\r\nthe traders, and supply the greater number of furs which pass through\r\nthe hands of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company, in exchange for other\r\ncommodities. They are mostly Chippeway Indians, well grown men with\r\nhardy constitutions. Their complexions are of the peculiar reddish black\r\ncolour always ascribed in Europe to the evil spirits of fairyland.\r\nThey wear very picturesque cloaks of skins and mantles of fur, with a\r\nhead-dress of eagle\xe2\x80\x99s feathers spread out like a lady\xe2\x80\x99s fan, and\r\nquivering with every motion of their thick black hair.\r\n\r\nSuch was the company to whom the Captain was doing the honours of Fort\r\nReliance. There was no dancing for want of music, but the \xe2\x80\x9cbuffet\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadmirably supplied the want of the hired musicians of the European\r\nballs. On the table rose a pyramidal pudding made by Mrs Joliffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown hands; it was an immense truncated cone, composed of flour, fat,\r\nrein-deer venison, and musk beef. The eggs, milk, and citron prescribed\r\nin recipe books were, it is true, wanting, but their absence was atoned\r\nfor by its huge proportions. Mrs Joliffe served out slice after slice\r\nwith liberal hands, yet there remained enough and to spare. Piles of\r\nsandwiches also figured on the table, in which ship biscuits took the\r\nplace of thin slices of English bread and butter, and dainty morsels of\r\ncorned beef that of the ham and stuffed veal of the old world. The sharp\r\nteeth of the Chippeway Indians made short work of the tough biscuits;\r\nand for drink there was plenty of whisky and gin handed round in little\r\npewter pots, not to speak of a great bowl of punch which was to close\r\nthe entertainment, and of which the Indians talked long afterwards in\r\ntheir wigwams.\r\n\r\nEndless were the compliments paid to the Joliffes that evening, but they\r\ndeserved them; how zealously they waited on the guests, with what easy\r\ngrace they distributed the refreshments! They did not need prompting,\r\nthey anticipated the wishes of each one. The sandwiches were succeeded\r\nby slices of the inexhaustible pudding, the pudding by glasses of gin or\r\nwhisky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, Mr Joliffe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too good, Corporal; but let me have time to breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Joliffe, I assure you, I can eat no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorporal Joliffe, I am at your mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more, Mrs Joliffe, no more, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the replies met with on every side by the zealous pair, but\r\ntheir powers of persuasion were such that the most reluctant yielded in\r\nthe end. The quantities of food and drink consumed were really enormous.\r\nThe hubbub of conversation increased. The soldiery and employ\xc3\xa9s became\r\nexcited. Here the talk was of hunting, there of trade. What plans were\r\nlaid for next season! The entire fauna of the Arctic regions would\r\nscarcely supply game enough for these enterprising hunters. They already\r\nsaw bears, foxes, and musk oxen, falling beneath their bullets, and\r\npole-cats by hundreds caught in their traps. Their imagination pictured\r\nthe costly furs piled up in the magazines of the Company, which was this\r\nyear to realise hitherto unheard of profits. And whilst the spirits thus\r\nfreely circulated inflamed the imagination of the Europeans, the large\r\ndoses of Captain Craventy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfire-water\xe2\x80\x9d imbibed by the Indians\r\nhad an opposite effect. Too proud to show admiration, too cautious to\r\nmake promises, the taciturn chiefs listened gravely and silently to the\r\nbabel of voices around them.\r\n\r\nThe captain enjoying the hurly burly, and pleased to see the poor\r\npeople, brought back as it were to the civilised world, enjoying\r\nthemselves so thoroughly, was here, there, and everywhere, answering all\r\ninquiries about the f\xc3\xaate with the words\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Joliffe, ask Joliffe !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they asked Joliffe, who had a gracious word for every body.\r\n\r\nSome of those employed in the garrison and civil service of Fort\r\nReliance must here receive a few words of special notice, for they were\r\npresently to go through experiences of a most terrible nature, which no\r\nhuman perspicacity could possibly have foreseen. Amongst others we must\r\nname Lieutenant Jaspar Hobson, Sergeant Long, Corporal and Mrs Joliffe,\r\nand the two foreign women already alluded to, in whose honour Captain\r\nCraventy\xe2\x80\x99s f\xc3\xaate was given.\r\n\r\nJaspar Hobson was a man of forty years of age. He was short and slight,\r\nwith little muscular power; but a force of will which carried him\r\nsuccessfully through all trials, and enabled him to rise superior to\r\nadverse circumstances. He was \xe2\x80\x9c a child of the Company.\xe2\x80\x9d His father,\r\nMajor Hobson, an Irishman from Dublin, who had now been dead for some\r\ntime, lived for many years at Fort Assiniboin with his wife. There\r\nJaspar Hobson was born. His childhood and youth were spent at the foot\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. His father brought him up strictly, and he\r\nbecame a man in self-control and courage whilst yet a boy in years.\r\nJaspar Hobson was no mere hunter, but a soldier, a brave and intelligent\r\nofficer. During the struggles in Oregon of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company\r\nwith the rival companies of the Union, he distinguished himself by his\r\nzeal and intrepidity, and rapidly rose to the rank of lieutenant. His\r\nwell-known merit led to his appointment to the command of an expedition\r\nto the north, the aim of which was to explore the northern shores of\r\nthe Great Bear Lake, and to found a fort on the confines of the American\r\ncontinent. Jaspar Hobson was to set out on his journey early in April.\r\n\r\nIf the lieutenant was the type of a good officer, Sergeant Long was\r\nthat of a good soldier. He was a man of fifty years of age, with a\r\nrough beard that looked as if it were made of cocoa-nut fibre.\r\nConstitutionally brave, and disposed to obey rather than to command.\r\nHe had no ambition but to obey the orders he received never questioning\r\nthem, however strange they might appear, never reasoning for himself\r\nwhen on duty for the Company-a true machine in uniform; but a perfect\r\nmachine, never wearing out; ever on the march, yet never showing signs\r\nof fatigue. Perhaps Sergeant Long was rather hard upon his men, as he\r\nwas upon himself. He would not tolerate the slightest infraction\r\nof discipline, and mercilessly ordered men into confinement for the\r\nslightest neglect, whilst he himself had never been reprimanded. In a\r\nword, he was a man born to obey, and this self-annihilation suited\r\nhis passive temperament. Men such as he are the materials of which a\r\nformidable army is formed. They are the arms of the service, obeying a\r\nsingle head. Is not this the only really powerful organisation? The two\r\ntypes of fabulous mythology, Briareus with a hundred arms and Hydra\r\nwith a hundred heads, well represent the two kinds of armies; and in\r\na conflict between them, which would be victorious? Briareus without a\r\ndoubt !\r\n\r\nWe have already made acquaintance with Corporal Joliffe. He was the busy\r\nbee of the party, but it was pleasant to hear him humming. He would have\r\nmade a better major-domo than a soldier; and he was himself aware of\r\nthis. So he called himself the \xe2\x80\x9c Corporal in charge of details,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nhe would have lost himself a hundred times amongst these details, had\r\nnot little Mrs Joliffe guided him with a firm hand. So it came to pass,\r\nthat Corporal Joliffe obeyed his wife without owning it, doubtless\r\nthinking to himself, like the philosopher Sancho, \xe2\x80\x9ca woman\xe2\x80\x99s advice\r\nis no such great thing, but he must be a fool who does not listen to\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is now time to say a few words of the two foreign women already\r\nalluded to more than once. They were both about forty years old, and\r\none of them well deserved to take first rank amongst celebrated female\r\ntravellers. The name of Paulina Barnett, the rival of the Pfeiffers,\r\nTinnis, and Haimaires of Hull, has been several times honourably\r\nmentioned at the meetings of the Royal Geographical Society. In her\r\njourneys up the Brahmaputra, as far as the mountains of Thibet,\r\nacross an unknown corner of New Holland, from Swan Bay to the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria, Paulina Barnett had given proof of the qualities of a great\r\ntraveller. She had been a widow for fifteen years, and her passion for\r\ntravelling led her constantly to explore new lands. She was tall, and\r\nher face, framed in long braids of hair, already touched with white, was\r\nfull of energy. She was near-sighted, and a double eye-glass rested upon\r\nher long straight nose, with its mobile nostrils. We must confess that\r\nher walk was somewhat masculine, and her whole appearance was suggestive\r\nof moral power, rather than of female grace. She was an Englishwoman\r\nfrom Yorkshire, possessed of some fortune, the greater part of which was\r\nexpended in adventurous expeditions, and some new scheme of exploration\r\nhad now brought her to Fort Reliance. Having crossed the equinoctial\r\nregions, she was doubtless anxious to penetrate to the extreme limits of\r\nthe hyperborean. Her presence at the fort was an event. The governor of\r\nthe Company had given her a special letter of recommendation to Captain\r\nCraventy, according to which the latter was to do all in his power to\r\nforward the design of the celebrated traveller to reach the borders of\r\nthe Arctic Ocean. A grand enterprise! To follow in the steps of Hearne,\r\nMackenzie, Rae, Franklin, and others. What fatigues, what trials, what\r\ndangers would have to be gone through in the conflict with the terrible\r\nelements of the Polar climate! How could a woman dare to venture where\r\nso many explorers have drawn back or perished? But the stranger now shut\r\nup in Fort Reliance was no ordinary woman; she was Paulina Barnett, a\r\nlaureate of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nWe must add that the celebrated traveller was accompanied by a servant\r\nnamed Madge. This faithful creature was not merely a servant, but\r\na devoted and courageous friend, who lived only for her mistress. A\r\nScotchwoman of the old type, whom a Caleb might have married without\r\nloss of dignity. Madge was about five years older than Mrs Barnett, and\r\nwas tall and strongly built. The two were on the most intimate terms;\r\nPaulina looked upon Madge as an elder sister, and Madge treated Paulina\r\nas her daughter.\r\n\r\nIt was in honour of Paulina Barnett that Captain Craventy was this\r\nevening treating his employ\xc3\xa9s and the Chippeway Indians. In fact,\r\nthe lady traveller was to join the expedition of Jaspar Hobson for the\r\nexploration of the north. It was for Paulina Barnett that the large\r\nsaloon of the factory resounded with joyful hurrahs. And it was no\r\nwonder that the stove consumed a hundredweight of coal on this memorable\r\nevening, for the cold outside was twenty-four degrees Fahrenheit below\r\nzero, and Fort Reliance is situated in 61\xc2\xb0 47\xe2\x80\x99 N. Lat., at least four\r\ndegrees from the Polar circle.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE HUDSON\xe2\x80\x99S BAY FUR COMPANY. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Craventy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Barnett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of your Lieutenant, Jaspar Hobson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he is an officer who will go far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the words, Will go far? Do you mean that he will\r\ngo beyond the Twenty-fourth parallel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Craventy could not help smiling at Mrs Paulina Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestion. They were talking together near the stove, whilst the guests\r\nwere passing backwards and forwards between the eating and drinking\r\ntables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9call that a man can do, will be done\r\nby Jaspar Hobson. The Company has charged him to explore the north of\r\ntheir possessions, and to establish a factory as near as possible to the\r\nconfines of the American continent, and he will establish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a great responsibility for Lieutenant Hobson !\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, madam, but Jaspar Hobson has never yet drawn back from a task\r\nimposed upon him, however formidable it may have appeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can quite believe it, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\r\nshall now see the Lieutenant at work. But what induces the Company to\r\nconstruct a fort on the shores of the Arctic Ocean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have a powerful motive, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may add a double motive. At no very distant date, Russia will\r\nprobably cede her American possessions to the Government of the United\r\nStates. [*1] When this cession has taken place, the Company will find\r\naccess to the Pacific Ocean extremely difficult, unless the North-west\r\npassage discovered by Mc\xe2\x80\x99Clure be practicable. [*1 Captain\r\nCraventy\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy has since been realised.] Fresh explorations will\r\ndecide this, for the Admiralty is about to send a vessel which will\r\ncoast along the North American continent, from Behring Strait to\r\nCoronation Gulf, on the eastern side of which the new-Art is to be\r\nestablished. If the enterprise succeed, this point will become an\r\nimportant factory, the centre of the northern fur trade. The transport\r\nof furs across the Indian territories involves a vast expenditure of\r\ntime and money, whereas, if the new route be available, steamers will\r\ntake them from the new fort to the Pacific Ocean in a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would indeed be an important result of the enterprise, if this\r\nNorth-west passage can really be used,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Paulina Barnett;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I think you spoke of a double motive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand I alluded to a matter of\r\nvital interest to the Company. But I must beg of you to allow me to\r\nexplain to you in a few words how the present state of things came\r\nabout, how it is in fact that the very source of the trade of this once\r\nflourishing Company is in danger of destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain then proceeded to give a brief sketch of the history of the\r\nfamous Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest times men employed the skins and furs of animals as\r\nclothing. The fur trade is therefore of very great antiquity. Luxury in\r\ndress increased to such an extent, that sumptuary laws were enacted to\r\ncontrol too great extravagance, especially in furs, for which there\r\nwas a positive passion. Vair and the furs of Siberian squirrels were\r\nprohibited at the middle of the 12th century.\r\n\r\nIn 1553 Russia founded several establishments in the northern steppes,\r\nand England lost no time in following her example. The trade in\r\nsables, ermines, and beavers, was carried on through the agency of the\r\nSamoiedes; but during the reign of Elizabeth, a royal decree restricted\r\nthe use of costly furs to such an extent, that for several years this\r\nbranch of industry was completely paralysed.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd May, 1670, a licence to trade in furs in the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay\r\nTerritory was granted to the Company, which numbered several men of high\r\nrank amongst its shareholders : the Duke of York, the Duke of Albemarle,\r\nthe Earl of Shaftesbury, &c. Its capital was then only \xc2\xa38420. Private\r\ncompanies were formidable rivals to its success; and French agents,\r\nmaking Canada their headquarters, ventured on hazardous but most\r\nlucrative expeditions. The active competition of these bold hunters\r\nthreatened the very existence of the infant Company.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Canada, however, somewhat lessened the danger of its\r\nposition. Three years after the taking of Quebec, 1776, the fur trade\r\nreceived a new impulse. English traders became familiar with the\r\ndifficulties of trade of this kind; they learned the customs of the\r\ncountry, the ways of the Indians and their system of exchange of goods,\r\nbut for all this the Company as yet made no profits whatever. Moreover,\r\ntowards 1784 some merchants of Montreal combined to explore the fur\r\ncountry, and founded that powerful North-west Company, which soon became\r\nthe centre of the fur trade. In 1798 the new Company shipped furs to the\r\nvalue of no less than \xc2\xa3120,000, and the existence of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay\r\nCompany was again threatened.\r\n\r\nWe must add, that the North-west Company shrank from no act, however\r\niniquitous, if its interests were at stake. Its agents imposed on their\r\nown employ\xc3\xa9s, speculated on the misery of the Indians, robbed them\r\nwhen they had themselves made them drunk, setting at defiance the Act\r\nof Parliament forbidding the sale of spirituous liquors on Indian\r\nterritory; and consequently realising immense profits, in spite of the\r\ncompetition of the various Russian and American companies which had\r\nsprung up\xe2\x80\x94the American Fur Company amongst others, founded in 1809,\r\nwith a capital of a million of dollars, which was carrying on operations\r\non the west of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company was probably in greater danger of ruin than\r\nany other; but in 1821, after much discussion, a treaty was made,\r\nin accordance with which its old rival the North-west Company became\r\namalgamated with it, the two receiving the common title of \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nHudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Fur Company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the only rival of this important association is the American\r\nSt Louis Fur Company. The Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company has numerous\r\nestablishments scattered over a domain extending over 3,700,000 square\r\nmiles. Its principal factories are situated on James Bay, at the mouth\r\nof the Severn, in the south, and towards the frontiers of Upper Canada,\r\non Lakes Athapeskow, Winnipeg, Superior, Methye, Buffalo, and near the\r\nColombia, Mackenzie, Saskatchewan, and Assiniboin rivers, &c. Fort York,\r\ncommanding the course of the river Nelson, is the headquarters of the\r\nCompany, and contains its principal fur dep\xc3\xb4t. Moreover, in 1842 it\r\ntook a lease of all the Russian establishments in North America at an\r\nannual rent of \xc2\xa340,000, so that it is now working on its own account\r\nthe vast tracts of country between the Mississippi and the Pacific\r\nOcean. It has sent out intrepid explorers in every direction: Hearne,\r\ntowards the Polar Sea, in 1770, to the discovery of the Coppermine\r\nRiver; Franklin, in 1819 to 1822, along 5550 miles of the American\r\ncoast; Mackenzie, who, after having discovered the river to which he\r\ngave his name, reached the shores of the Pacific at 52\xc2\xb0 24\xe2\x80\x99 N. Lat.\r\nThe following is a list of the quantities of skins and furs despatched\r\nto Europe by the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company in 1833-34, which will give an\r\nexact idea of the extent of its trade:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBeavers . . . . . . . . . . . 1,074\r\n\r\nSkins and young Beavers,. . 92,288\r\n\r\nMusk Rats,. . . . . . . . . 694,092\r\n\r\nBadgers,. . . . . . . . . . 1,069\r\n\r\nBears,. . . . . . . . . . . 7,451\r\n\r\nErmines,. . . . . . . . . . 491\r\n\r\nFoxes, . . . . . . . . . . . 9,937\r\n\r\nLynxes, . . . . . . . . . . 14,255\r\n\r\nSables, . . . . . . . . . . 64,490\r\n\r\nPolecats, . . . . . . . . . 25,100\r\n\r\nOtters, . . . . . . . . . . 22,303\r\n\r\nRacoons,. . . . . . . . . . 713\r\n\r\nSwans, . . . . . . . . . . 7,918\r\n\r\nWolves, . . . . . . . . . . 8,484\r\n\r\nWolverines, . . . . . . . . 1,571\r\n\r\nSuch figures ought to bring in a large profit to the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay\r\nCompany, but unfortunately they have not been maintained, and for the\r\nlast twenty years have been decreasing.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this decline was the subject of Captain Craventy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexplanation to Mrs Paulina Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil 1839, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Company was in a flourishing\r\ncondition. In that year the number of furs exported was 2,350,000, but\r\nsince then the trade has gradually declined, and this number is now\r\nreduced by one-half at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you suppose is the cause of this extraordinary decrease\r\nin the exportation of furs?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe depopulation of the hunting territories, caused by the activity,\r\nand, I must add, the want of foresight of the hunters. The game was\r\ntrapped and killed without mercy. These massacres were conducted in the\r\nmost reckless and short-sighted fashion. Even females with young and\r\ntheir little ones did not escape. The consequence is, that the animals\r\nwhose fur is valuable have become extremely rare. The otter has almost\r\nentirely disappeared, and is only to be found near the islands of the\r\nNorth Pacific. Small colonies of beavers have taken refuge on the shores\r\nof the most distant rivers. It is the same with many other animals,\r\ncompelled to flee before the invasion of the hunters. The traps, once\r\ncrowded with game, are now empty. The price of skins is rising just\r\nwhen a great demand exists for furs. Hunters have gone away in disgust,\r\nleaving none but the most intrepid and indefatigable, who now penetrate\r\nto the very confines of the American continent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Paulina Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact of the fur-bearing\r\nanimals having taken refuge beyond the polar circle, is a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s motive in founding a factory on the\r\nborders of the Arctic Ocean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only so, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Company is also\r\ncompelled to seek a more northern centre of operations, for an Act of\r\nParliament has lately greatly reduced its domain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the motive for this reduction?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the traveller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very important question of political economy was involved, madam;\r\none which could not fail greatly to interest the statesmen of\r\nGreat Britain. In a word, the interests of the Company and those of\r\ncivilisation are antagonistic. It is to the interest of the Company to\r\nkeep the territory belonging to it in a wild uncultivated condition.\r\nEvery attempt at clearing ground was pitilessly put a stop to, as\r\nit drove away the wild animals, so that the monopoly enjoyed by the\r\nHudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company was detrimental to all agricultural enterprise.\r\nAll questions not immediately relating to their own particular trade,\r\nwere relentlessly put aside by the governors of the association. It was\r\nthis despotic, and, in a certain sense, immoral system, which provoked\r\nthe measures taken by Parliament, and, in 1837, a commission appointed\r\nby the Colonial Secretary decided that it was necessary to annex to\r\nCanada all the territories suitable for cultivation, such as the Red\r\nRiver and Saskatchewan districts, and to leave to the Company only\r\nthat portion of its land which appeared to be incapable of future\r\ncivilisation. The next year the Company lost the western slopes of the\r\nRocky Mountains, which it held direct from the Colonial Office, and you\r\nwill now understand, madam, how the agents of the Company, having lost\r\ntheir power over their old territories, are determined before giving up\r\ntheir trade to try to work the little known countries of the north,\r\nand so open a communication with the Pacific by means of the North-west\r\npassage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Paulina Barnett was now well informed as to the ulterior projects of\r\nthe celebrated Company. Captain Craventy had given her a graphic sketch\r\nof the situation, and it is probable he would have entered into further\r\ndetails, had not an incident cut short his harangue.\r\n\r\nCorporal Joliffe announced in a loud voice that, with Mrs Joliffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassistance, he was about to mix the punch. This news was received as it\r\ndeserved. The bowl\xe2\x80\x94or rather, the basin\xe2\x80\x94was filled with the precious\r\nliquid. It contained no less than ten pints of coarse rum. Sugar,\r\nmeasured out by Mrs Joliffe, was piled up at the bottom, and on the top\r\nfloated slices of lemon shrivelled with age. Nothing remained to be\r\ndone but to light this alcoholic lake, and the Corporal, match in hand,\r\nawaited the order of his Captain, as if he were about to spring a mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Joliffe !\xe2\x80\x9d at last said Captain Craventy.\r\n\r\nThe light was applied to the bowl, and in a moment the punch was in\r\nflames, whilst the guests applauded and clapped their hands. Ten minutes\r\nafterwards, full glasses of the delightful beverage were circulating\r\namongst the guests, fresh bidders for them coming forward in endless\r\nsuccession, like speculators on the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah! hurrah! three cheers for Mrs Barnett! A cheer for the\r\nCaptain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these joyful shouts cries were heard from outside.\r\nSilence immediately fell upon the company assembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Long,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cgo and see what is the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at his chief\xe2\x80\x99s order, the Sergeant, leaving his glass unfinished,\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. A SAVANT THAWED. Sergeant Long hastened to the narrow\r\npassage from which opened the outer door of the fort, and heard the\r\ncries redoubled, and combined with violent blows on the postern gate,\r\nsurrounded by high walls, which gave access to the court. The Sergeant\r\npushed open the door, and plunging into the snow, already a foot deep;\r\nhe waded through it, although half-blinded by the cutting sleet, and\r\nnipped by the terrible cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil does any one want at this time of night?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nthe Sergeant to himself, as he mechanically removed the heavy bars of\r\nthe gate; \xe2\x80\x9cnone but Esquimaux would dare to brave such a temperature\r\nas this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen! open! open!\xe2\x80\x9d they shouted from without.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am opening,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sergeant Long, who really seemed to be a\r\nlong time about it.\r\n\r\nAt last the door swung open, and the Sergeant was almost upset by\r\na sledge, drawn by six dogs, which dashed past him like a flash of\r\nlightning. Worthy Sergeant Long only just escaped being crushed, but he\r\ngot up without a murmur, closed the gate, and returned to the house at\r\nhis ordinary pace, that is to say, at the rate of seventy-five strides a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Craventy, Lieutenant Jaspar Hobson, and Corporal Joliffe\r\nwere already outside, braving the intense cold, and staring at the\r\nsledge, white with snow, which had just drawn up in front of them.\r\n\r\nA man completely enveloped in furs now descended from it,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFort Reliance?;\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Craventy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold him! Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA courier of the Company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I bring a traveller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA traveller! And what does he want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is come to see the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this reply, Captain Craventy said to himself the man must be a fool.\r\nBut there was no time to announce this opinion, for the courier had\r\ntaken an inert mass from the sledge, a kind of bag covered with snow,\r\nand was about to carry it into the house, when the Captain inquired\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that bag?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my traveller,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the courier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this traveller?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe astronomer, Thomas Black.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is frozen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he must be thawed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomas Black, carried by the Sergeant, the Corporal, and the courier,\r\nnow made his entrance into the house of the fort, and was taken to a\r\nroom on the first floor, the temperature of which was bearable, thanks\r\nto a glowing stove. He was laid upon a bed, and the Captain took his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt was literally frozen. The wrappers and furred mantles, in which\r\nThomas Black was rolled up like a parcel requiring care, were removed,\r\nand revealed a man of about fifty. He was short and stout, his hair\r\nwas already touched with grey, his beard was untrimmed, his eyes were\r\nclosed, and his lips pressed together as if glued to one another. If he\r\nbreathed at all, it was so slightly that the frost-work on the windows\r\nwould not have been affected by it. Joliffe undressed him, and turned\r\nhim rapidly on to his face and back again, with the words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, sir, when do you mean to return to consciousness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the visitor who had arrived in so strange a manner showed no signs\r\nof returning life, and Corporal Joliffe could think of no better means\r\nto restore the lost vital heat than to give him a bath in the bowl of\r\nhot punch.\r\n\r\nVery happily for Thomas Black, however, Lieutenant Jaspar Hobson had\r\nanother idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnow, bring snow!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of it in the court of Fort Reliance; and whilst the\r\nSergeant went to fetch the snow, Joliffe removed all the astronomer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes. The body of the unfortunate man was covered with white\r\nfrost-bitten patches. It was urgently necessary to restore the\r\ncirculation of the blood in the affected portions. This result Jaspar\r\nHobson hoped to obtain by vigorous friction with the snow. We know that\r\nthis is the means generally employed in the polar countries to set going\r\nafresh the circulation of the blood arrested by the intense cold, even\r\nas the rivers are arrested in their courses by the icy touch of winter.\r\nSergeant Loin soon returned, and he and Joliffe gave the new arrival\r\nsuch a rubbing as he had probably never before received. It was no\r\nsoft and agreeable friction, but a vigorous shampooing most lustily\r\nperformed, more like the scratching of a curry-comb than the caresses of\r\na human hand.\r\n\r\nAnd during the operation the loquacious Corporal continued to exhort the\r\nunconscious traveller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, sir. What do you mean by getting frozen like this. Now,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be so obstinate !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProbably it was obstinacy which kept Thomas Black from deigning to show\r\na sign of life. At the end of half an hour the rubbers began to despair,\r\nand were about to discontinue their exhausting efforts, when the poor\r\nman sighed several times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lives; he is coming to !\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jaspar Hobson.\r\n\r\nAfter having warmed the outside of his body, Corporal Joliffe hurried\r\nto do the same for the inside, and hastily fetched a few glasses of\r\nthe punch. The traveller really felt much revived by them; the colour\r\nreturned to his cheeks, expression to his eyes, and words to his\r\nlips, so that Captain Craventy began to hope that he should have an\r\nexplanation from Thomas Black himself of his strange arrival at the fort\r\nin such a terrible condition.\r\n\r\nAt last the traveller, well covered with wraps, rose on his elbow, and\r\nsaid in a voice still faint\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFort Reliance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Craventy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is before you, and is happy to bid you welcome. But may I inquire\r\nwhat brings you to Fort Reliance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is come to see the moon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the courier, who evidently\r\nthought this a happy answer.\r\n\r\nIt satisfied Thomas Black too, for he bent his head in assent and\r\nresumed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Hobson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not yet started?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot. yet, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Thomas Black, \xe2\x80\x9cI have only to thank you, and to go\r\nto sleep until to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain and his companions retired, leaving their strange visitor to\r\nhis repose. Half an hour later the f\xc3\xaate was at an end, and the guests\r\nhad regained their respective homes, either in the different rooms of\r\nthe fort, or the scattered houses outside the enceinte.\r\n\r\nThe next day Thomas Black was rather better. His vigorous constitution\r\nhad thrown off the effects of the terrible chill he had had. Any one\r\nelse would have died from it; but he was not like other men.\r\n\r\nAnd now who was this astronomer? Where did he come from? Why had he\r\nundertaken this journey across the territories of the Company in the\r\ndepth of winter? What did the courier\xe2\x80\x99s reply signify?\xe2\x80\x94 To see the\r\nmoon! The moon could be seen anywhere; there was no need to come to the\r\nhyperborean regions to look at it!\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts which passed through Captain Craventy\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\nBut the next day, after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s talk with his new guest, he had\r\nlearned all he wished to know.\r\n\r\nThomas Black was an astronomer attached to the Greenwich Observatory, so\r\nbrilliantly presided over by Professor Airy. Mr Black was no theorist,\r\nbut a sagacious and intelligent observer; and in the twenty years\r\nduring which he had devoted himself to astronomy, he had rendered great\r\nservices to the science of ouranography. In private life he was a simple\r\nnonentity; he existed only for astronomy; he lived in the heavens, not\r\nupon the earth; and was a true descendant of the witty La Fontaine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsavant who fell into a well. He could talk of nothing but stars and\r\nconstellations. He ought to have lived in a telescope. As an observer\r\nbe had not his rival; his patience was inexhaustible; he could watch for\r\nmonths for a cosmical phenomenon. He had a specialty of his own, too; he\r\nhad studied luminous meteors and shooting stars, and his discoveries in\r\nthis branch of astronomical science were considerable. When ever minute\r\nobservations or exact measurements and definitions were required,\r\nThomas Black was chosen for the service; for his clearness of sight was\r\nsomething remarkable. The power of observation is not given to everyone,\r\nand it will not therefore be surprising that the Greenwich astronomer\r\nshould have been chosen for the mission we are about to describe, which\r\ninvolved results so interesting for selenographic science.\r\n\r\nWe know that during a total eclipse of the sun the moon is surrounded by\r\na luminous corona. But what is the origin of this corona? Is it a real\r\nsubstance? or is it only an effect of the diffraction of the sun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrays near the moon? This is a question which science has hitherto been\r\nunable to answer.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1706 this luminous halo was scientifically described.\r\nThe corona was minutely examined during the total eclipse of 1715 by\r\nLonville and Halley, by Maraldi in 1724, by Antonio de\xe2\x80\x99Ulloa in\r\n1778, and by Bonditch and Ferrer in 1806; but their theories were so\r\ncontradictory that no definite conclusion could be arrived at. During\r\nthe total eclipse of 1842, learned men of all nations\xe2\x80\x94Airy, Arago,\r\nKeytal, Langier, Mauvais, Otto, Struve, Petit, Baily, &c.\xe2\x80\x94endeavoured\r\nto solve the mystery of the origin of the phenomenon; but in spite\r\nof all their efforts, \xe2\x80\x9cthe disagreement,\xe2\x80\x9d says Arago, \xe2\x80\x9cof the\r\nobservations taken in different places by skilful astronomers of one and\r\nthe same eclipse, have involved the question in fresh obscurity, so that\r\nit is now impossible to come to any certain conclusion as to the cause\r\nof the phenomenon.\xe2\x80\x9d Since this was written, other total eclipses have\r\nbeen studied with no better results.\r\n\r\nYet the solution of the question is of such vast importance to\r\nselenographic science that no price would be too great to pay for it.\r\nA fresh opportunity was now about to occur to study the much-discussed\r\ncorona. A total eclipse of the sun\xe2\x80\x94total, at least, for the extreme\r\nnorth of America, for Spain and North Africa\xe2\x80\x94was to take place on\r\nJuly 18th, 1860. It was arranged between the astronomers of different\r\ncountries that simultaneous observations should be taken at the various\r\npoints of the zone where the eclipse would be total. Thomas Black was\r\nchosen for the expedition to North America, and was now much in the same\r\nsituation as the English astronomers who were transported to Norway and\r\nSweden on the occasion of the eclipse of 1851.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be imagined that Thomas Black seized with avidity the\r\nopportunity offered him of studying this luminous halo. He was also to\r\nexamine into the nature of the red prominences which appear on different\r\nparts of the edge of the terrestrial satellite when the totality of the\r\neclipse has commenced; and should he be able satisfactorily to establish\r\ntheir origin, he would be entitled to the applause of the learned men of\r\nall Europe.\r\n\r\nThomas Black eagerly prepared for his journey. He obtained urgent\r\nletters of recommendation to the principal agents of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBay Company. He ascertained that an expedition was to go to the extreme\r\nnorth of the continent to found a new fort. It was an opportunity not\r\nto be lost; so he set out, crossed the Atlantic, landed at New York,\r\ntraversed the lakes to the Red River settlement, and pressed on from\r\nfort to fort in a sledge, under the escort of a courier of the Company;\r\nin spite of the severity of the winter, braving all the dangers of a\r\njourney across the Arctic regions, and arriving at Fort Reliance on the\r\n19th March in the condition we have described.\r\n\r\nSuch was the explanation given by the astronomer to Captain Craventy. He\r\nat once placed himself entirely at Mr Black\xe2\x80\x99s service, but could not\r\nrefrain from inquiring why he had been in such a great hurry to arrive,\r\nwhen the eclipse was not to take place until the following year, 1860?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the astronomer, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard that the Company\r\nwas sending an expedition along the northern coast of America, and I did\r\nnot wish to miss the departure of Lieutenant Hobson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Black,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cif the Lieutenant had already\r\nstarted, I should have felt it my duty to accompany you myself to the\r\nshores of the Polar Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with fresh assurances of his willingness to serve him, the Captain\r\nagain bade his new guest welcome to Fort Reliance.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. A FACTORY. One of the largest of the lakes beyond the 61st\r\nparallel is that called the Great Slave Lake; it is two hundred and\r\nfifty miles long by fifty across, and is situated exactly at 61\xc2\xb0 25\xe2\x80\x99\r\nN. lat. and 114\xc2\xb0 W. long. The surrounding districts slope down to it,\r\nand it completely fills a vast natural hollow. The position of the lake\r\nin the very centre of the hunting districts. once swarming with game,\r\nearly attracted the attention of the Company. Numerous streams either\r\ntake their rise from it or flow into it-the Mackenzie, the Athabasca,\r\n&c.; and several important forts have been constructed on its\r\nshores\xe2\x80\x94Fort Providence on the north, and Fort Resolution on the south.\r\nFort Reliance is situated on the north-east extremity, and is about\r\nthree hundred miles from the Chesterfield inlet, a long narrow estuary\r\nformed by the waters of Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay.\r\n\r\nThe Great Slave Lake is dotted with little islands, the granite and\r\ngneiss of which they are formed jutting up in several places. Its\r\nnorthern banks are clothed with thick woods, shutting out the barren\r\nfrozen district beyond, not inaptly called the \xe2\x80\x9cCursed Land.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nsouthern regions, on the other band, are flat, without a rise of any\r\nkind, and the soil is mostly calcareous. The large ruminants of the\r\npolar districts\xe2\x80\x94the buffaloes or bisons, the flesh of which forms\r\nalmost the only food of the Canadian and native hunters\xe2\x80\x94seldom go\r\nfurther north than the Great Slave Lake.\r\n\r\nThe trees on the northern shores of the lake form magnificent forests.\r\nWe need not be astonished at meeting with such fine vegetation in this\r\nremote district. The Great Slave Lake is not really in a higher latitude\r\nthan Stockholm or Christiania. We have only to remember that the\r\nisothermal lines, or belts of equal heat, along which heat is\r\ndistributed in equal quantities, do not follow the terrestrial\r\nparallels, and that with the same latitude, America is ever so much\r\ncolder than Europe. In April the streets of New York are still white\r\nwith snow, yet the latitude of New York is nearly the same as that of\r\nthe Azores. The nature of a country, its position with regard to\r\nthe oceans, and even the conformation of its soil, all influence its\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nIn summer Fort Reliance was surrounded with masses of verdure,\r\nrefreshing to the sight after the long dreary winter. Timber was\r\nplentiful in these forests, which consisted almost entirely of poplar,\r\npine, and birch. The islets on the lake produced very fine willows. Game\r\nwas abundant in the underwood, even during the bad season. Further\r\nsouth the hunters from the fort successfully pursued bisons, elks, and\r\nCanadian porcupines, the flesh of which is excellent. The waters of the\r\nSlave Lake were full of fish; trout in them attained to an immense size,\r\ntheir weight often exceeding forty pounds. Pikes, voracious lobes, a\r\nsort of charr or grayling called \xe2\x80\x9c blue fish,\xe2\x80\x9d and countless legions\r\nof tittamegs, the Coregonus of naturalists, disported themselves in the\r\nwater, so that the inhabitants of Fort Reliance were well supplied with\r\nfood. Nature provided for all their wants; and clothed in the skins of\r\nfoxes, martens, bears, and other Arctic animals, they were able to brave\r\nthe rigour of the winter.\r\n\r\nThe fort, properly so called, consisted of a wooden house with a\r\nground-floor and one upper storey. In it lived the commandant and his\r\nofficers. The barracks for the soldiers, the magazines of the Company,\r\nand the offices where exchanges were made, surrounded this house.\r\nA little chapel, which wanted nothing but a clergyman, and a\r\npowder-magazine, completed the buildings of the settlement. The whole\r\nwas surrounded by palisades twenty-five feet high, defended by a\r\nsmall bastion with a pointed roof at each of the four corners of the\r\nparallelogram formed by the enceinte. The fort was thus protected from\r\nsurprise, a necessary precaution in the days when the Indians, instead\r\nof being the purveyors of the Company, fought for the independence\r\nof their native land, and when the agents and soldiers of rival\r\nassociations disputed the possession of the rich fur country.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company employed about a million men on\r\nits territories. It held supreme authority over them, an authority which\r\ncould even inflict death. The governors of the factories could regulate\r\nsalaries, and arbitrarily fix the price of provisions and furs; and as\r\na result of this irresponsible power, they often realised a profit of no\r\nless than three hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nWe shall see from the following table, taken from the \xe2\x80\x9c Voyage of\r\nCaptain Robert Lade,\xe2\x80\x9d on what terms exchanges were formerly made with\r\nthose Indians who have since become the best hunters of the Company.\r\nBeavers\xe2\x80\x99 skins were then the currency employed in buying and selling.\r\n\r\nThe Indians paid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFor one gun,\r\n\r\n10 beavers\xe2\x80\x99 skins\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c half a pound of powder,\r\n\r\n1 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c four pounds of shot,\r\n\r\n1 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c one axe,\r\n\r\n1 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c six knives,\r\n\r\n1 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c one pound of glass beads,\r\n\r\n1 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c one laced coat,\r\n\r\n6 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c one coat not laced,\r\n\r\n5 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c one laced female dress,\r\n\r\n6 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c one pound of tobacco,\r\n\r\n1 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c one box of powder,\r\n\r\n1 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c one comb and one looking glass,\r\n\r\n2 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a few years ago beaver-skins became so scarce that the currency had\r\nto be changed. Bison-furs are now the medium of trade. When an Indian\r\npresents himself at the fort, the agents of the Company give him as many\r\npieces of wood as he brings skins, and he exchanges these pieces of wood\r\nfor manufactured articles on the premises; and as the Company fix the\r\nprice of the articles they buy and sell, they cannot fail to realise\r\nlarge profits.\r\n\r\nSuch was the mode of proceeding in Fort Reliance and other factories;\r\nso that Mrs Paulina Barnett was able to watch the working of the system\r\nduring her stay, which extended until the 16th April. Many a long talk\r\ndid she have with Lieutenant Hobson, many were the projects they formed,\r\nand firmly were they both determined to allow no obstacle to check their\r\nadvance. As for Thomas Black, he never opened his lips except when his\r\nown special mission was discussed. He was wrapped up in the subject of\r\nthe luminous corona and red prominences of the moon; he lived but to\r\nsolve the problem, and in the end made Mrs Paulina Barnett nearly as\r\nenthusiastic as himself. How eager the two were to cross the Arctic\r\nCircle, and how far off the 18th July 1860 appeared to both, but\r\nespecially to the impatient Greenwich astronomer, can easily be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for departure could not be commenced until the middle\r\nof March, and a month passed before they were completed. In fact, it was\r\na formidable undertaking to organise such an expedition for crossing the\r\nPolar regions. Everything had to betaken with them-food, clothes, tools,\r\narms, ammunition, and a nondescript collection of various requisites.\r\n\r\nThe troops, under the command of Lieutenant Jaspar Hobson, were one\r\nchief and two subordinate officers, with ten soldiers, three of whom\r\ntook their wives with them. They were all picked men, chosen by Captain\r\nCraventy on account of their energy and resolution. We append a list of\r\nthe whole party:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n1. Lieutenant Jaspar Hobson.\r\n\r\n11. Sabine, soldier.\r\n\r\n2. Sergeant Long.\r\n\r\n12. Hope, do.\r\n\r\n3. Corporal Joliffe.\r\n\r\n13. Kellet, do.\r\n\r\n4. Petersen, soldier\r\n\r\n14. Mrs Rae\r\n\r\n5. Belcher, do.\r\n\r\n15. Mrs Joliffe.\r\n\r\n6. Rae, do\r\n\r\n16. Mrs Mac-Nab.\r\n\r\n7. Marbre, do\r\n\r\n17. Mrs Paulina Barnett.\r\n\r\n8. Garry, do\r\n\r\n18. Madge.\r\n\r\n9. Pond, do\r\n\r\n19. Thomas Black\r\n\r\n10. Mac-Nab, do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all, nineteen persons to be transported several hundreds of miles\r\nthrough a desert and imperfectly-known country.\r\n\r\nWith this project in view, however, the Company had collected everything\r\nnecessary for the expedition. A dozen sledges, with their teams of dogs,\r\nwere in readiness. These primitive vehicles consisted of strong but\r\nlight planks joined together by transverse bands. A piece of curved\r\nwood, turning up at the end like a skate, was fixed beneath the sledge,\r\nenabling it to cleave the snow without sinking deeply into it. Six swift\r\nand intelligent dogs, yoked two and two, and controlled by the long\r\nthong brandished by the driver, drew the sledges, and could go at a rate\r\nof fifteen miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe wardrobe of the travellers consisted of garments made of\r\nreindeer-skins, lined throughout with thick furs. All wore linen next\r\nthe skin as a protection against the sudden changes of temperature\r\nfrequent in these latitudes. Each one, officer or soldier, male or\r\nfemale, wore seal-skin boots sewn with twine, in the manufacture of\r\nwhich the natives excel. These boots are absolutely impervious, and\r\nare so flexible that they are admirably adapted for walking. Pine-wood\r\nsnow-shoes, two or three feet long, capable of supporting the weight of\r\na man on the most brittle snow, and enabling him to pass over it with\r\nthe rapidity of a skater on ice, can be fastened to the soles of the\r\nseal-skin boots. Fur caps and deer-skin belts completed the costumes.\r\n\r\nFor arms, Lieutenant Hobson had the regulation musketoons provided by\r\nthe Company, pistols, ordnance sabres, and plenty of ammunition;\r\nfor tools : axes, saws, adzes, and other instruments required in\r\ncarpentering. Then there was the collection of all that would be needed\r\nfor setting up a factory in the remote district for which they were\r\nbound : a stove; a smelting furnace, two airpumps for ventilation, an\r\nIndia-rubber boat, only inflated when required, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe party might have relied for provisions on the hunters amongst them.\r\nSome of the soldiers were skilful trackers of game, and there were\r\nplenty of reindeer in the Polar regions. Whole tribes of Indians, or\r\nEsquimaux, deprived of bread and all other nourishment, subsist entirely\r\non this venison, which is both abundant and palatable. But as delays and\r\ndifficulties had to be allowed for, a certain quantity of provisions was\r\ntaken with them. The flesh of the bison, elk, and deer, amassed in the\r\nlarge battues on the south of the lake; corned beef, which will keep for\r\nany length of time; and some Indian preparations, in which the flesh of\r\nanimals, ground to powder, retains its nutritive properties in a very\r\nsmall bulk, requiring no cooking, and forming a very nourishing diet,\r\nwere amongst the stores provided in case of need.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson likewise took several casks of rum and whisky; but\r\nhe was firmly resolved to economise these spirits, so injurious to the\r\nhealth in cold latitudes, as much as possible. The Company had placed\r\nat his disposal a little portable medicine-chest, containing formidable\r\nquantities of lime-juice, lemons, and other simple remedies necessary\r\nto check, or if possible to prevent, the scorbutic affections which take\r\nsuch a terrible form in these regions.\r\n\r\nAll the men had been chosen with great care; none were too stout or\r\ntoo thin, and all had for years been accustomed to the severity of\r\nthe climate, and could therefore more easily endure the fatigues of an\r\nexpedition to the Polar Sea. They were all brave, high-spirited fellows,\r\nwho had taken service of their own accord. Double pay had been promised\r\nthem during their stay at the confines of the American continent, should\r\nthey succeed in making a settlement beyond the seventieth parallel.\r\n\r\nThe sledge provided for Mrs Barnett and her faithful Madge was rather\r\nmore comfortable than the others. She did not wish to be treated better\r\nthan her travelling companions, but yielded to the urgent request of\r\nCaptain Craventy, who was but carrying out the wishes of the Company.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle which brought Thomas Black to Fort Reliance also\r\nconveyed him and his scientific apparatus from it. A few astronomical\r\ninstruments, of which there were not many in those days-a telescope for\r\nhis selenographic observations, a sextant for taking the latitude, a\r\nchronometer for determining the longitudes, a few maps, a few books,\r\nwere all stored away in this sledge, and Thomas Black relied upon his\r\nfaithful dogs to lose nothing by the way.\r\n\r\nOf course the food for the various teams was not forgotten. There were\r\naltogether no less than seventy-two dogs, quite a herd to provide for by\r\nthe way, and it was the business of the hunters to cater for them. These\r\nstrong intelligent animals were bought of the Chippeway Indians, who\r\nknow well how to train them for their arduous calling.\r\n\r\nThe little company was most skilfully organised. The zeal of Lieutenant\r\nJaspar Hobson was beyond all praise. Proud of his mission, and devoted\r\nto his task; he neglected nothing which could insure success. Corporal\r\nJoliffe, always a busybody, exerted himself without producing any very\r\ntangible results; but his wife was most useful and devoted; and Mrs\r\nPaulina Barnett had already struck up a great friendship with the brisk\r\nlittle Canadian woman, whose fair hair and large soft eyes were so\r\npleasant to look at.\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely add that Captain Craventy did all in his power to\r\nfurther the enterprise. The instructions he had received from the\r\nCompany showed what great importance they attached to the success of the\r\nexpedition, and the establishment of a new factory beyond the seventieth\r\nparallel. We may therefore safely affirm that every human effort likely\r\nto insure success which could be made was made; but who could tell what\r\ninsurmountable difficulties nature might place in the path of the brave\r\nLieutenant I who could tell what awaited him and his devoted little\r\nband.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. FROM FORT RELIANCE TO FORT ENTERPRISE. The first fine days\r\ncame at last. The green carpet of the hills began to appear here\r\nand there where the snow had melted. A few migratory birds from the\r\nsouth-such as swans, bald-headed eagles, &c.\xe2\x80\x94passed through the warmer\r\nair. The poplars, birches, and willows began to bud, and the redheaded\r\nducks, of which there are so many species in North America, to skim the\r\nsurface of the numerous pools formed by the melted snow. Guillemots,\r\npuffins, and eider ducks sought colder latitudes; and little shrews\r\nno bigger than a hazel-nut ventured from their holes, tracing strange\r\nfigures on the ground with their tiny-pointed tails. It was intoxicating\r\nonce more to breathe the fresh air of spring, and to bask in the\r\nsunbeams. Nature awoke once more from her heavy sleep in the long winter\r\nnight, and smiled as she opened her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe renovation of creation in spring is perhaps more impressive in the\r\nArctic regions than in any other portion of the globe, on account of the\r\ngreater contrast with what has gone before.\r\n\r\nThe thaw was not, however, complete. The thermometer, it is true, marked\r\n41\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit above zero; but the mean temperature of the nights kept\r\nthe surface of the snowy plains solid\xe2\x80\x94a good thing for the passage of\r\nsledges, of which Jaspar Hobson meant to avail himself before the thaw\r\nbecame complete.\r\n\r\nThe ice of the lake was still unbroken. During the last month several\r\nsuccessful hunting expeditions had been made across the vast smooth\r\nplains, which were already frequented by game. Mrs Barnett was\r\nastonished at the skill with which the men used their snow-shoes,\r\nscudding along at the pace of a horse in full gallop. Following Captain\r\nCraventy\xe2\x80\x99s advice, the lady herself practised walking in these\r\ncontrivances, and she soon became very expert in sliding over the snow.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few days several bands of Indians had arrived at the\r\nfort to exchange the spoils of the winter chase for manufactured goods.\r\nThe season had been bad. There were a good many polecats and sables; but\r\nthe furs of beavers, otters, lynxes, ermines, and foxes were scarce. It\r\nwas therefore a wise step for the Company to endeavour to explore a new\r\ncountry, where the wild animals had hitherto escaped the rapacity of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th April Lieutenant Jaspar Hobson and his party\r\nwere ready to start. The route across the known districts, between the\r\nSlave Lake and that of the Great Bear beyond the Arctic Circle, was\r\nalready determined. Jaspar Hobson was to make for Fort Confidence, on\r\nthe northern extremity of the latter lake; and he was to revictual at\r\nFort Enterprise, a station two hundred miles further to the north-west,\r\non the shores of the Snare Lake, By travelling at the rate of fifteen\r\nmiles a day the Lieutenant hoped to halt there about the beginning of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the expedition was to take the shortest route to Cape\r\nBathurst, on the North American coast. It was agreed that in a year\r\nCaptain Craventy should send a convoy with provisions to Cape Bathurst,\r\nand that a detachment of the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s men was to go to meet this\r\nconvoy, to guide it to the spot where the new fort was to be erected.\r\nThis plan was a guarantee against any adverse circumstances, and left\r\na means of communication with their fellow-creatures open to the\r\nLieutenant and his voluntary companions in exile.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th April dogs and sledges were awaiting the travellers at the\r\npostern gate. Captain Craventy called the men of the party together and\r\nsaid a few kind words to them. He urged them above all things to stand\r\nby one another in the perils they might be called upon to meet; reminded\r\nthem that the enterprise upon which they were about to enter required\r\nself-denial and devotion, and that submission to their officers was\r\nan indispensable condition of success. Cheers greeted the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeech, the adieux were quickly made, and each one took his place in the\r\nsledge assigned to him. Jaspar Hobson and Sergeant Long went first; then\r\nMrs Paulina Barnett and Madge, the latter dexterously wielding the long\r\nEsquimaux whip, terminating in a stiff thong. Thomas Black and one of\r\nthe soldiers, the Canadian, Petersen, occupied the third sledge ;and\r\nthe others followed, Corporal and Mrs Joliffe bringing up the rear.\r\nAccording to the orders of Lieutenant Hobson, each driver kept as nearly\r\nas possible at the same distance from the preceding sledge, so as to\r\navoid all confusion\xe2\x80\x94a necessary precaution, as a collision between two\r\nsledges going at full speed, might have had disastrous results.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Fort Reliance, Jaspar Hobson at once directed his course\r\ntowards the north-west. The first thing to be done was to cross the\r\nlarge river connecting Lakes Slave and Wolmsley, which was, however,\r\nstill frozen so hard as to be undistinguishable from the vast white\r\nplains around. A uniform carpet of snow covered the whole country, and\r\nthe sledges, drawn by their swift teams, sped rapidly over the firm\r\nsmooth surface.\r\n\r\nThe weather was fine, but still very cold. The sun, scarce above the\r\nhorizon, described a lengthened curve; and its rays, reflected on\r\nthe snow, gave more light than heat. Fortunately not a breath of air\r\nstirred, and this lessened the severity of the cold, although the rapid\r\npace of the sledges through the keen atmosphere must have been trying to\r\nany one not inured to the rigour of a Polar climate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jaspar Hobson to the Sergeant, who sat\r\nmotionless beside him as if rooted to his seat; \xe2\x80\x9cthe journey has\r\ncommenced favourably. The sky is cloudless; the temperature propitious,\r\nour equipages shoot along like express trains, and as long as this fine\r\nweather lasts we shall get on capitally. What do you think, Sergeant\r\nLong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant, who never\r\ndiffered from his chief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike myself, Sergeant, you are determined to push on as far north as\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Lieutenant Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have but to command to be obeyed, Lieutenant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, Sergeant; I know that with you to bear is to obey. Would\r\nthat all our men understood as you do the importance of our mission, and\r\nwould devote themselves body and soul to the interests of the Company!\r\nAh, Sergeant Long, I know if I gave you an impossible order\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant, there is no such thing as an impossible order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Suppose now I ordered you to go to the North Pole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant, I should go !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to comeback!\xe2\x80\x9d added Jaspar Hobson with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should come back,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sergeant Long simply.\r\n\r\nDuring this colloquy between Lieutenant Hobson and his Sergeant a slight\r\nascent compelled the sledges to slacken speed, and Mrs Barnett and\r\nMadge also exchanged a few sentences. These two intrepid women, in their\r\notter-skin caps and white bear-skin mantles, gazed in astonishment upon\r\nthe rugged scenery around them, and at the white outlines of the huge\r\nglaciers standing out against the horizon. They had already left behind\r\nthem the hills of the northern banks of the Slave Lake, with their\r\nsummits crowned with the gaunt skeletons of trees. The vast plains\r\nstretched before them in apparently endless succession. The rapid flight\r\nand cries of a few birds of passage alone broke the monotony of the\r\nscene. Now and then a troop of swans, with plumage so white that the\r\nkeenest sight could not distinguish them from the snow when they settled\r\non the ground, rose into view in the clear blue atmosphere and pursued\r\ntheir journey to the north.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an extraordinary country !\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Paulina Barnett.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a difference between these Polar regions and the green prairies\r\nof Australia! You remember, Madge, how we suffered from the heat on the\r\nshores of the Gulf of Carpentaria\xe2\x80\x94you remember the cloudless sky and\r\nthe parching sunbeams?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not the gift of remembering like\r\nyou. You retain your impressions, I forget mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Madge !\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have forgotten the\r\ntropical heat of India arid Australia? You have no recollection of\r\nour agonies when water failed us in the desert, when the pitiless sun\r\nscorched us to the bone, when even the night brought us no relief from\r\nour sufferings !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Paulina,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge, wrapping her furs more closely round\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x9cno, I remember nothing. How could I now recollect the sufferings\r\nto which you allude\xe2\x80\x94the heat, the agonies of thirst\xe2\x80\x94when we are\r\nsurrounded on every side by ice, and I have but to stretch my arm out of\r\nthis sledge to pick up a handful of snow? You talk to me of heat, when\r\nwe are freezing beneath our bearskins; you recall the broiling rays of\r\nthe sun when its April beams cannot melt the icicles on our lips! No,\r\nchild, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to persuade me it\xe2\x80\x99s hot anywhere else; don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell me I ever complained of being too warm, for I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Paulina Barnett could not help smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, poor Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very cold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, child, I am cold; but I rather like this climate. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\ndoubt it\xe2\x80\x99s very healthy, and I think North America will agree with me.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s really a very fine country !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Madge; it is a fine country, and we have as yet seen none of\r\nthe wonders it contains. But wait until we reach the Arctic Ocean;\r\nwait until the winter shuts us in with its gigantic icebergs and thick\r\ncovering of snow; wait till the northern storms break over us, and the\r\nglories of the Aurora Borealis and of the splendid constellations of\r\nthe Polar skies are spread out above our heads; wait till we have lived\r\nthrough the strange long six months\xe2\x80\x99 night, and then indeed you will\r\nunderstand the infinite variety, the infinite beauty, of our Creator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandiwork !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Mrs Paulina Barnett, carried away by her vivid imagination.\r\nShe could see nothing but beauty in these deserted regions, with their\r\nrigorous climate. Her enthusiasm got the better for the time of her\r\njudgment. Her sympathy with nature enabled her to read the touching\r\npoetry of the ice-bound north-the poetry embodied in the Sagas, and sung\r\nby the bards of the time of Ossian. But Madge, more matter of fact\r\nthan her mistress, disguised from herself neither the dangers of an\r\nexpedition to the Arctic Ocean, nor the sufferings involved in wintering\r\nonly thirty degrees at the most from the North Pole.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the most robust had sometimes succumbed to the fatigues,\r\nprivations, and mental and bodily agonies endured in this severe\r\nclimate. Jaspar Hobson had not, it is true, to press on to the very\r\nhighest latitudes of the globe,; he had not to reach the pole itself,\r\nor to follow in the steps of Parry, Ross, Mc\xe2\x80\x99Clure, Kean, Morton,\r\nand others. But after once crossing the Arctic Circle, there is little\r\nvariation in the temperature; it does not increase in coldness in\r\nproportion to the elevation reached. Granted that Jaspar Hobson did not\r\nthink of going beyond the seventieth parallel, we must still remember\r\nthat Franklin and his unfortunate companions died of cold and hunger\r\nbefore they had penetrated beyond 68\xc2\xb0 N. lat.\r\n\r\nVery different was the talk in the sledge occupied by Mr and Mrs\r\nJoliffe. Perhaps the gallant Corporal had too often drunk to the success\r\nof the expedition on starting; for, strange to say, he was disputing\r\nwith his little wife. Yes, he was actually contradicting her, which\r\nnever happened except under extraordinary circumstances!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mrs Joliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cno, you have nothing to fear.\r\nA sledge is not more difficult to guide than a pony-carriage, and the\r\ndevil take me if I can\xe2\x80\x99t manage a team of dogs !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t question your skill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Joliffe; \xe2\x80\x9cI only ask\r\nyou not to go so fast. You are in front of the whole caravan now, and\r\nI hear Lieutenant Hobson calling out to you to resume your proper place\r\nbehind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him call, Mrs Joliffe, let him call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the Corporal, urging on his dogs with a fresh cut of the whip,\r\ndashed along at still greater speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Joliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated his little wife; \xe2\x80\x9cnot so fast, we\r\nare going down hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown hill, Mrs Joliffe; you call that down hill? why, it\xe2\x80\x99s up\r\nhill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you we are going down!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated poor Mrs Joliffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you we are going up; look how the dogs pull !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhoever was right, the dogs became uneasy. The ascent was, in fact,\r\npretty steep; the sledge dashed along at a reckless pace, and was\r\nalready considerably in advance of the rest of the party. Mr and Mrs\r\nJoliffe bumped up and down every instant, the surface of the snow became\r\nmore and more uneven, and the pair, flung first to one side and then to\r\nthe other, knocked against each other and the sledge, and were horribly\r\nbruised and shaken. But the Corporal would listen neither to the advice\r\nof his wife nor to the shouts of Lieutenant Hobson. The latter, seeing\r\nthe danger of this reckless course, urged on his own animals, and the\r\nrest of the caravan followed at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\nBut the Corporal became more and more excited-the speed of his equipage\r\ndelighted him. He shouted, he gesticulated, and flourished his long whip\r\nlike an accomplished sportsman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful things these whips!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Esquimaux wield\r\nthem with unrivalled skill !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not an Esquimaux!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Joliffe, trying in vain to\r\narrest the arm of her imprudent husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard tell,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the Corporal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard tell\r\nthat the Esquimaux can touch any dog they like in any part, that they\r\ncan even cut out a bit of one of their ears with the stiff thong at the\r\nend of the whip. I am going to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try, don\xe2\x80\x99t try, Joliffe !\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the poor little\r\nwoman, frightened out of her wits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, Mrs Joliffe, don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid; I know what I can\r\ndo. The fifth dog on the right is misbehaving himself;. I will correct\r\nhim a little!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Corporal Joliffe was evidently not yet enough of an Esquimaux to be\r\nable to manage the whip with its thong four feet longer than the sledge;\r\nfor it unrolled with an ominous hiss, and rebounding, twisted itself\r\nround Corporal Joliffe\xe2\x80\x99s own neck, sending his fur cap into the air,\r\nperhaps with one of his ears in it.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the dogs flung themselves on one side, the sledge was\r\noverturned, and the pair were flung into the snow. Fortunately it was\r\nthick and soft, so that they escaped unhurt. But what a disgrace for the\r\nCorporal! how reproachfully his little wife looked at him, and how stern\r\nwas the reprimand of Lieutenant Hobson!\r\n\r\nThe sledge was picked up, but it was decided that henceforth the reins\r\nof the dogs, like those of the household, were to be in the hands of\r\nMrs Joliffe. The crest-fallen Corporal was obliged to submit, and the\r\ninterrupted journey was resumed.\r\n\r\nNo incident worth mentioning occurred during the next fifteen days. The\r\nweather continued favourable, the cold was not too severe, and on the\r\n1st May the expedition arrived at Fort Enterprise.\r\n\r\n:\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. A WAPITI DUEL. Two hundred miles had been traversed since\r\nthe expedition left Fort Reliance. The travellers, taking advantage of\r\nthe long twilight, pressed on day and night, and were literally overcome\r\nwith fatigue when they reached Fort Enterprise, near the shores of Lake\r\nSnare.\r\n\r\nThis fort was no more than a dep\xc3\xb4t of provisions, of little importance,\r\nerected a few years before by the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company. It served as a\r\nresting-place for the men taking the convoys of furs from the Great Bear\r\nLake, some three hundred miles further to the north-west. About a dozen\r\nsoldiers formed the garrison. The fort consisted of a wooden house\r\nsurrounded by palisades. But few as were the comforts it offered,\r\nLieutenant Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s companions gladly took refuge in it and rested\r\nthere for two days.\r\n\r\nThe gentle influence of the Arctic spring was beginning to be felt. Here\r\nand there the snow had melted, and the temperature of the nights was no\r\nlonger below freezing point. A few delicate mosses and slender grasses\r\nclothed the rugged ground with their soft verdure; and from between the\r\nstones peeped the moist calices of tiny, almost colourless, flowers.\r\nThese faint signs of reawakening vegetation, after the long night of\r\nwinter, were refreshing to eyes weary of the monotonous whiteness of\r\nthe snow; and the scattered specimens of the Flora of the Arctic regions\r\nwere welcomed with delight.\r\n\r\nMrs Paulina Barnett and Jaspar Hobson availed themselves of this leisure\r\ntime to visit the shores of the little lake. They were both students and\r\nenthusiastic lovers of nature. Together they wandered amongst the ice\r\nmasses, already beginning to break up, and the waterfalls created by\r\nthe action of the rays of the sun. The surface itself of Lake Snare\r\nwas still intact, not a crack denoted the approaching thaw; but it was\r\nstrewn with the ruins of mighty icebergs, which assumed all manner\r\nof picturesque forms, and the beauty of which was heightened when the\r\nlight, diffracted by the sharp edges of the ice, touched them with all\r\nmanner of colours. One might have fancied that a rainbow, crushed in a\r\npowerful hand, bad been flung upon the ground, its fragments crossing\r\neach other as they fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beautiful scene!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Paulina Barnett. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nprismatic effects vary at every change of our position. Does it not seem\r\nas if we were bending over the opening of an immense kaleidoscope, or\r\nare you already weary of a sight so new and interesting to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9calthough I was born and\r\nbred on this continent, its beauties never pall upon me. But if your\r\nenthusiasm is so great when you see this scenery with the sun shining\r\nupon it, what will it be when you are privileged to behold the terrible\r\ngrandeur of the winter? To own the truth, I think the sun, so much\r\nthought of in temperate latitudes, spoils my Arctic home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett, smiling at the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nremark; \xe2\x80\x9cfor my part, I think the sun a capital travelling companion,\r\nand I shall not be disposed to grumble at the warmth it gives even in\r\nthe Polar regions !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jaspar Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cI am one of those who think\r\nit best to visit Russia in the winter, and the Sahara Desert in the\r\nsummer. You then see their peculiar characteristics to advantage. The\r\nsun is a star of the torrid and temperate zones, and is out of place\r\nthirty degrees from the North Pole. The true sky of this country is the\r\npure frigid sky of winter, bright with constellations, and sometimes\r\nflushed with the glory of the Aurora Borealis. This land is the land of\r\nthe night, not of the day; and you have yet to make acquaintance with\r\nthe delights and marvels of the long Polar night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever visited the temperate zones of Europe and America?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam; and I admired them as they deserved. But I returned home\r\nwith fresh love and enthusiasm for my native land. Cold is my element,\r\nand no merit is due to me for braving it. It has no power over me; and,\r\nlike the Esquimaux. I can live for months together in a snow hut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Lieutenant Hobson, it is quite cheering to hear our dreaded\r\nenemy spoken of in such terms. I hope to prove myself worthy to be your\r\ncompanion, and wherever you venture, we will venture together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree, madam, I agree; and may all the women and soldiers\r\naccompanying me show themselves as resolute as you. If so, God helping\r\nus, we shall indeed advance far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing to complain of yet,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a\r\nsingle accident has occurred, the weather has been propitious, the cold\r\nnot too severe-everything has combined to aid us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam; but the sun which you admire so much will soon create\r\ndifficulties for us, and strew obstacles in our path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Lieutenant Hobson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that the heat will soon have changed the aspect of the\r\ncountry; that the melted ice will impede the sliding of the sledges;\r\nthat the ground will become rough and uneven; that our panting dogs will\r\nno longer carry us along with the speed of an arrow; that the rivers and\r\nlakes will resume their liquid state, and that we shall have to ford\r\nor go round them. All these changes, madam, due to the influence of the\r\nsolar rays, will cause delays, fatigue, and dangers, the very least of\r\nwhich will be the breaking of the brittle snow beneath our feet, or the\r\nfalling of the avalanches from the summits of the icebergs. For all this\r\nwe have to thank the gradual rise of the sun higher and higher above\r\nthe horizon. Bear this in mind, madam: of the four elements of the old\r\ncreation, only one is necessary to us here, the air; the other three,\r\nfire, earth, and water, are de trop in the Arctic regions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course the Lieutenant was exaggerating, and Mrs Barnett could easily\r\nhave retorted with counter-arguments; but she liked to hear his raptures\r\nin praise of his beloved country, and she felt that his enthusiasm was a\r\nguarantee that he would shrink from no obstacle.\r\n\r\nYet Jaspar Hobson was right when he said the sun would cause\r\ndifficulties. This was seen when the party set out again on the 4th\r\nMay, three days later. The thermometer, even in the coldest part of the\r\nnight, marked more than 32\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit. A complete thaw set in, the\r\nvast white sheet of snow resolved itself into water. The irregularities\r\nof the rocky soil caused constant jolting of the sledges, and the\r\npassengers were roughly shaken. The roads were so heavy that the dogs\r\nhad to go at a slow trot, and the reins were therefore again entrusted\r\nto the hands of the imprudent Corporal\r\n\r\nJoliffe. Neither shouts nor flourishings of the whip had the slightest\r\neffect on the jaded animals.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the travellers lightened the sledges by walking little\r\nway. This mode of locomotion suited the hunters, who were now gradually\r\napproaching the best districts for game in the whole of English America.\r\nMrs Paulina Barnett and Madge took a great interest in the chase, whilst\r\nThomas Black professed absolute indifference to all athletic exercise.\r\nHe had not come all this distance to hunt the polecat or the ermine, but\r\nmerely to look at the moon at the moment when her disc should cover\r\nthat of the sun. When the queen of the night rose above the horizon, the\r\nimpatient astronomer would gaze at her with eager eyes, and one day the\r\nLieutenant said to him\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a bad look-out for you, Mr Black, if by any unlucky\r\nchance the moon should fail to keep her appointment on the 16th July\r\n1860.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Hobson,\xe2\x80\x9d gravely replied the astronomer, \xe2\x80\x9cif the moon\r\nwere guilty of such a breach of good manners, I should indeed have cause\r\nto complain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chief hunters of the expedition were the soldiers Marbre and Sabine,\r\nboth very expert at their business. Their skill was wonderful; and the\r\ncleverest Indians would not have surpassed them in keenness of sight,\r\nprecision of aim, or manual address. They were alike trappers and\r\nhunters, and were acquainted with all the nets and snares for taking\r\nsables, otters, wolves, foxes, bears, &c. No artifice was unknown to\r\nthem, and Captain Craventy had shown his wisdom in choosing two such\r\nintelligent men to accompany the little troop.\r\n\r\nWhilst on the march however, Marbre and Sabine had no time for setting\r\ntraps. They could not separate from the others for more than an hour or\r\ntwo at a time, and were obliged to be content with the game which passed\r\nwithin range of their rifles. Still they were fortunate enough to kill\r\ntwo of the large American ruminants, seldom met with in such elevated\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th May the hunters asked permission to follow\r\nsome fresh traces they had found, and the Lieutenant not only granted\r\nit, but himself accompanied them with Mrs Paulina Barnett, and they went\r\nseveral miles out of their route towards the east.\r\n\r\nThe impressions were evidently the result of the passage of about\r\nhalf-a-dozen large deer. There could be no mistake about it; Marbre\r\nand Sabine were positive on that point, and could even have named the\r\nspecies to which the animals belonged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem surprised to have met with traces of these animals here,\r\nLieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cthis species is rarely seen beyond\r\n57\xc2\xb0 N. lat. We generally hunt them at the south of the Slave Lake,\r\nwhere they feed upon the shoots of willows and poplars, and certain wild\r\nroses to which they are very partial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose these creatures, like those with valuable furs, have fled\r\nfrom the districts scoured by the hunters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no other explanation of their presence at 65\xc2\xb0 N. lat.,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied the Lieutenant-\xe2\x80\x9dthat is, if the men are not mistaken as to the\r\norigin of the footprints.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sabine; \xe2\x80\x9cMarbre and I are not mistaken. These\r\ntraces were left by deer, the deer we hunters call red deer, and the\r\nnatives wapitis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d added Marbre; \xe2\x80\x9cold trappers like us are\r\nnot to be taken in; besides, don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear that peculiar whistling\r\nsound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party had now reached the foot of a little hill, and as the snow\r\nhad almost disappeared from its sides they were able to climb it,\r\nand hastened to the summit, the peculiar whistling noticed by Marbre\r\nbecoming louder, mingled with cries resembling the braying of an ass,\r\nand proving that the two hunters were not mistaken.\r\n\r\nOnce at the top of the hill, the adventurers looked eagerly towards the\r\neast. The undulating plains were still white with snow, but its dazzling\r\nsurface was here and there relieved with patches of stunted light green\r\nvegetation. A few gaunt shrubs stretched forth their bare and shrivelled\r\nbranches, and huge icebergs with precipitous sides stood out against the\r\ngrey background of the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWapitis! wapitis!-there they are !\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sabine and Marbre at\r\nonce, pointing to a group of animals distinctly visible about a quarter\r\nof a mile to the east.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they doing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are fighting, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cthey always do when\r\nthe heat of the Polar sun inflames their blood-another deplorable result\r\nof the action of the radiant orb of day !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom where they stood the party could easily watch the group of wapitis.\r\nThey were fine specimens of the family of deer known under the various\r\nnames of stags with rounded antlers, American stags, roebucks, grey elks\r\nand red elks, &c. These graceful creatures have slender legs and brown\r\nskins with patches of red hair, the colour of which becomes darker in\r\nthe warmer season. The fierce males are easily distinguished from the\r\nfemales by their fine white antlers, the latter being entirely without\r\nthese ornaments. These wapitis were once very numerous all over North\r\nAmerica, and the United States imported a great many; but clearings\r\nwere begun on every side, the forest trees fell beneath the axe of\r\nthe pioneer of civilisation, and the wapitis took refuge in the more\r\npeaceful districts of Canada; but they were soon again disturbed, and\r\nwandered to the shores of Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay. So that although the wapiti\r\nthrives in a cold country, Lieutenant Hobson was right in saying that it\r\nseldom penetrates beyond 57\xc2\xb0 N. latitude; and the specimens now found\r\nhad doubtless fled before the Chippeway Indians, who hunt them without\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nThe wapitis were so engrossed in their desperate struggle that they were\r\nunconscious of the approach of the hunters; but they would probably\r\nnot have ceased fighting, had they been aware of it. Marbre and Sabine,\r\naware of their peculiarity in this respect, might therefore have\r\nadvanced fearlessly upon them, and have taken aim at leisure.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson suggested that they should do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Marbre; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let us spare our powder\r\nand shot. These beasts are engaged in a war to the death, and we shall\r\narrive in plenty of time to pick up the vanquished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave these wapitis a commercial value?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Paulina Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cand their skin, which is not quite\r\nso thick as that of the elk, properly so called makes very valuable\r\nleather. By rubbing this skin with the fat and brains of the animal\r\nitself, it is rendered flexible, and neither damp nor dryness injures\r\nit. The Indians are therefore always eager to procure the skins of the\r\nwapitis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes not the flesh make admirable venison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty good, madam; only pretty good. It is tough, and does not taste\r\nvery nice; the fat becomes hard directly it is taken from the fire, and\r\nsticks to the teeth. It is certainly inferior as an article of food to\r\nthe flesh of other deer; but when meat is scarce we are glad enough to\r\neat it, and it supports life as well as anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and Lieutenant Hobson had been chatting together for some\r\nminutes, when, with the exception of two, the wapitis suddenly ceased\r\nfighting. Was their rage satiated?- or had they perceived the hunters,\r\nand felt the approach of danger? Whatever the cause, all but two fine\r\ncreatures fled a towards the east With incredible speed; in a few\r\ninstants they were out of sight, and the swiftest horse could not have\r\ncaught them up.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, two magnificent specimens remained on the field\r\nof battle. Heads down, antlers to antlers, hind legs stretched and\r\nquivering, they butted at each other without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause. Like\r\ntwo wrestlers struggling for a prize which neither will yield, they\r\nwould not separate, but whirled round and round together on their front\r\nlegs as if riveted to one another. What implacable rage !\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nMrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cthe wapitis really are most\r\nspiteful beasts. I have no doubt they are fighting out an old\r\nquarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould not this be the time to approach them, when they are blinded\r\nwith rage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sabine; \xe2\x80\x9cthey won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nescape us now. They will not stir from where they are when we are three\r\nsteps from them, the rifles at our shoulders, and our fingers on the\r\ntriggers !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed? Yes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hobson, who had carefully examined the\r\nwapitis after the hunter\xe2\x80\x99s remark; \xe2\x80\x9cand whether at our hands or\r\nfrom the teeth of wolves, those wapitis will meet death where they now\r\nstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you mean, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go nearer, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of\r\nstartling the animals; for, as our hunter says, they are no longer\r\ncapable of flight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four now descended the hill, and in a few minutes gained the theatre\r\nof the struggle. The wapitis had not moved. They were pushing at\r\neach other like a couple of rams, and seemed to be inseparably glued\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in the heat of the combat the antlers of the two creatures had\r\nbecome entangled together to such an extent that they could no longer\r\nseparate without breaking them. This often happens in the hunting\r\ndistricts. It is not at all uncommon to find antlers thus connected\r\nlying on the ground; the poor encumbered animals soon die of hunger, or\r\nthey become an easy prey to wild beasts.\r\n\r\nTwo bullets put an end to the fight between the wapitis; and Marbre\r\nand Sabine taking immediate possession, carried off their skins to be\r\nsubsequently prepared, leaving their bleeding carcasses to be devoured\r\nby wolves and bears.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. The expedition continued to advance\r\ntowards the north-west; but the great inequalities of the ground made it\r\nhard work for the dogs to get along, and the poor creatures, who could\r\nhardly be held in when they started, were now quiet enough. Eight or ten\r\nmiles a day were as much as they could accomplish, although Lieutenant\r\nHobson urged them on to the utmost.\r\n\r\nHe was anxious to get to Fort Confidence, on the further side of the\r\nGreat Bear Lake, where he hoped to obtain some useful information. Had\r\nthe Indians frequenting the northern banks of the lake been able to\r\ncross the districts on the shores of the sea? was the Arctic Ocean open\r\nat this time of year? These were grave questions, the reply to which\r\nwould decide the fate of the new factory.\r\n\r\nThe country through which the little troop was now passing was\r\nintersected by numerous streams, mostly tributaries of the two large\r\nrivers, the Mackenzie and Coppermine, which flow from the south to the\r\nnorth, and empty themselves into the Arctic Ocean. Lakes, lagoons, and\r\nnumerous pools are formed between these two principal arteries; and\r\nas they were no longer frozen over, the sledges could not venture upon\r\nthem, and were compelled to go around them, which caused considerable\r\ndelay. Lieutenant Hobson was certainly right in saying that winter is\r\nthe time to visit the hyperborean regions, for they are then far easier\r\nto traverse. Mrs Paulina Barnett had reason to own the justice of this\r\nassertion than once.\r\n\r\nThis region, included in the \xe2\x80\x9cCursed Land,\xe2\x80\x9d was, besides, completely\r\ndeserted, as are the greater portion of the districts of the extreme\r\nnorth of America. It has been estimated that there is but one inhabitant\r\nto every ten square miles. Besides the scattered natives, there are some\r\nfew thousand agents or soldiers of the different fur-trading companies;\r\nbut they mostly congregate in the southern districts and about the\r\nvarious factories. No human footprints gladdened the eyes of the\r\ntravellers, the only traces on the sandy soil were those of ruminants\r\nand rodents. Now and then a fierce polar bear was seen, and Mrs Paulina\r\nBarnett expressed her surprise at not meeting more of these terrible\r\ncarnivorous beasts, of whose daily attacks on whalers and persons\r\nshipwrecked in Baffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bay and on the coasts of Greenland and\r\nSpitzbergen she had read in the accounts of those who had wintered in\r\nthe Arctic regions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait for the winter, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cwait till\r\nthe cold makes them hungry, and then you will perhaps see as many as you\r\ncare about !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the 23d May, after a long and fatiguing journey, the expedition at\r\nlast reached the Arctic Circle. We know that this latitude 23\xc2\xb0 27\xe2\x80\x99\r\n57\xe2\x80\x9d from the North Pole, forms the mathematical limit beyond which\r\nthe rays of the sun do not penetrate in the winter, when the northern\r\ndistricts of the globe are turned away from the orb of day. Here, then,\r\nthe travellers entered the true Arctic region, the northern Frigid Zone.\r\n\r\nThe latitude had been very carefully obtained by means of most accurate\r\ninstruments, which were handled with equal skill by the astronomer and\r\nby Lieutenant Hobson. Mrs Barnett was present at the operation, and\r\nhad the satisfaction of hearing that she was at last about to cross the\r\nArctic Circle. It was with a feeling of just pride that she received the\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have already passed through the two Torrid Zones in your previous\r\njourneys,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cand now you are on the verge of the\r\nArctic Circle. Few explorers have ventured into such totally different\r\nregions. Some, so to speak, have a specialty for hot countries, and\r\nchoose Africa or Australia as the field for their investigations. Such\r\nwere Barth, Burton, Livingstone Speke, Douglas, Stuart, &c. Others, on\r\nthe contrary, have a passion for the Arctic regions, still so little\r\nknown. Mackenzie, Franklin, Penny, Kane, Parry, Rae, &c., preceded us on\r\nour present journey; but we must congratulate you, Mrs Barnett, on being\r\na more cosmopolitan traveller than all of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see everything or at least try to see everything,\r\nLieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied. Mrs Paulina; \xe2\x80\x9cand I think the dangers and\r\ndifficulties are about equal everywhere. Although we have not to dread\r\nthe fevers of the unhealthy torrid regions, or the attacks of the fierce\r\nblack races, in this Frigid Zone, the cold is a no less formidable\r\nenemy; and I suspect that the white bears we are liable to meet with\r\nhere will give us quite as warm a reception as would the tigers of\r\nThibet or the lions of Africa. In Torrid and Frigid Zones alike there\r\nare vast unexplored tracts which will long defy the efforts of the\r\nboldest adventurers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jaspar Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think the hyperborean\r\nregions will longer resist thorough exploration. The natives are\r\nthe chief obstacle in tropical regions, and I am well aware how many\r\ntravellers have fallen victims to savages. But civilisation will\r\nnecessarily subdue the wild races sooner or later; whereas in the Arctic\r\nand Antarctic Zones it is not the inhabitants who arrest the progress of\r\nthe explorer, but Nature herself who repels those who approach her, and\r\nparalyses their energies with the bitter cold !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think, then, that the secrets of the most remote districts of\r\nAfrica and Australia will have been fathomed before the Frigid Zone has\r\nbeen entirely examined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cand I think my opinion is\r\nfounded on facts. The most intrepid discoverers of the Arctic regions\r\n- Parry, Penny, Franklin, M\xe2\x80\x99Clure, Dane, and Morton \xe2\x80\x94 did not get\r\nbeyond 83\xc2\xb0 north latitude, seven degrees from the pole \xe2\x80\x94 whereas\r\nAustralia has several times been crossed from south to north by the\r\nbold Stuart; and even Africa, with all its terrors, was traversed by\r\nLivingstone from the Bay of Loanga to the mouth of the Zambesi. We are,\r\ntherefore, nearer to geographical knowledge of the equatorial countries\r\nthan of the Polar districts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that the Pole itself will ever be reached by man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired Mrs Paulina Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, adding with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cby man or\r\nwoman. But I think other means must be tried of reaching this point,\r\nwhere all the meridians of the globe cross each other, than those\r\nhitherto adopted by travellers. We hear of the open sea, of which\r\ncertain explorers are said to have caught a glimpse. But if such a sea,\r\nfree from ice, really exist, it is very difficult to get at, and no one\r\ncan say positively whether it extends to the North Pole. For my part, I\r\nthink an open sea would increase rather than lessen the difficulties of\r\nexplorers. As for me, I would rather count upon firm footing, whether on\r\nice or rock, all the way. Then I would organise successive expeditions,\r\nestablishing dep\xc3\xb4ts of provisions and fuel nearer and nearer to the\r\nPole; and so, with plenty of time, plenty of money, and perhaps the\r\nsacrifice of a good many lives, I should in the end solve the great\r\nscientific problem. I should, I think, at last reach the hitherto\r\ninaccessible goal !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are right, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cand if\r\never you try the experiment, I should not be afraid to join you, and\r\nwould gladly go to set up the Union Jack at the North Pole. But that is\r\nnot our present object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot our immediate object, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when once\r\nthe projects of the Company are realised, when the new fort has been\r\nerected on the confines of the American continent, it may become the\r\nnatural starting-point of all expeditions to the north. Besides, should\r\nthe fur-yielding animals, too zealously hunted, take refuge at the Pole,\r\nwe should have to follow them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless costly furs should go out of fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO madam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will always be some pretty\r\nwoman whose wish for a sable muff or an ermine tippet must be gratified\r\n!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cand probably the\r\nfirst discoverer of the Pole will have been led thither in pursuit of a\r\nsable or a silver fox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9c Such is human nature,\r\nand greed of gain will always carry a man further than zeal for\r\nscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! do you utter such sentiments?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madam, what am I but an employ\xc3\xa9 of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company?\r\nand does the Company risk its capital and agents with any other hope\r\nthan an increase of profits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Hobson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I know you well\r\nenough to assert that on occasion you would be ready to devote body and\r\nsoul to science. If a purely geographical question called you to the\r\nPole, I feel sure you would not hesitate to go. But,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with\r\na smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthe solution of this great problem is still far distant. We\r\nhave but just reached the verge of the Arctic Circle, but I hope we may\r\ncross it without any very great difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I fear is doubtful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant, who had been\r\nattentively examining the sky during their conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe weather\r\nhas looked threatening for the last few days. Look at the uniformly grey\r\nhue of the heavens. That mist will presently resolve itself into snow;\r\nand if the wind should rise ever so little, we shall have to battle with\r\na fearful storm. I wish we were at the Great Bear Lake !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not let us lose any time, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, rising;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgive the signal to start at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant needed no urging. Had he been alone, or accompanied by a\r\nfew men as energetic as himself, he would have pressed on day and night;\r\nbut he was obliged to make allowance for the fatigue of others, although\r\nhe never spared himself. He therefore granted a few hours of rest to\r\nhis little party, and it was not until three in the afternoon that they\r\nagain set out.\r\n\r\nJaspar Hobson was not mistaken in prophesying a change in the weather.\r\nIt came very soon. During the afternoon of the same day the mist became\r\nthicker, and assumed a yellowish and threatening hue. The Lieutenant,\r\nalthough very uneasy, allowed none of his anxiety to appear, but had a\r\nlong consultation with Sergeant Long whilst the dogs of his sledge were\r\nlaboriously preparing to start.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the district now to be traversed was very unsuitable\r\nfor sledges. The ground was very uneven; ravines were of frequent\r\noccurrence; and masses of granite or half-thawed icebergs blocked up\r\nthe road, causing constant delay. The poor dogs did their best, but the\r\ndrivers\xe2\x80\x99 whips no longer produced any effect upon them.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Lieutenant and his men were often obliged to walk to rest the\r\nexhausted animals, to push the sledges, or even sometimes to lift them\r\nwhen the roughness of the ground threatened to upset them. The incessant\r\nfatigue was, however, borne by all without a murmur. Thomas Black alone,\r\nabsorbed in his one idea, never got out of his sledge, and indeed be was\r\nso corpulent that all exertion was disagreeable to him.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the soil changed from the moment of entering the Arctic\r\nCircle. Some geological convulsion had evidently upheaved the enormous\r\nblocks strewn upon the surface. The vegetation, too, was of a more\r\ndistinctive character. Wherever they were sheltered from the keen north\r\nwinds, the flanks of the hills were clothed not only with shrubs, but\r\nwith large trees, all of the same species \xe2\x80\x94 pines, willows, and firs\r\n\xe2\x80\x94 proving by their presence that a certain amount of vegetative force\r\nis retained even in the Frigid Zone. Jaspar Hobson hoped to find such\r\nspecimens of the Arctic Flora even on the verge of the Polar Sea; for\r\nthese trees would supply him with wood to build his fort, and fuel to\r\nwarm its inhabitants. The same thought passed through the minds of his\r\ncompanions, and they could not help wondering at the contrast between\r\nthis comparatively fertile region, and the long white plains stretching\r\nbetween the Great Slave Lake and Fort Enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt night the yellow mist became more opaque; the wind rose, the snow\r\nbegan to fall in large flakes, and the ground was soon covered with a\r\nthick white carpet. In less than an hour the snow was a foot deep, and\r\nas it did not freeze but remained in a liquid state, the sledges could\r\nonly advance with extreme difficulty; the curved fronts stuck in the\r\nsoft substance, and the dogs were obliged to stop again and again.\r\n\r\nTowards eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening the wind became very boisterous.\r\nThe snow, driven before it, was flung upon the ground or whirled in the\r\nair, forming one huge whirlpool. The dogs, beaten back by the squall\r\nand blinded with snow, could advance no further. The party was then in\r\na narrow gorge between huge icebergs, over which the storm raged with\r\nfearful fury. Pieces of ice, broken off by the hurricane, were hurled\r\ninto the pass; partial avalanches, any one of which could have crushed\r\nthe sledges and their inmates, added to its dangers, and to press\r\non became impossible. The Lieutenant no longer insisted, and after\r\nconsulting with Sergeant Long, gave the order to halt. It was now\r\nnecessary to find a shelter from the snow-drift; but this was no\r\ndifficult matter to men accustomed to Polar expeditions. Jaspar Hobson\r\nand his men knew well what they had to do under the circumstances. It\r\nwas not the first time they had been surprised by a tempest some hundred\r\nmiles from the forts of the Company, without so much as an Esquimaux hut\r\nor Indian hovel in which to lay their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the icebergs! to the icebergs !\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jaspar Hobson.\r\n\r\nEvery one understood what he meant. Snow houses were to be hollowed\r\nout of the frozen masses, or rather holes were to be dug, in which each\r\nperson could cower until the storm was over. Knives and hatchets were\r\nsoon at work on the brittle masses of ice, and in three-quarters of an\r\nhour some ten dens had been scooped out large enough to contain two or\r\nthree persons each. The dogs were left to themselves, their own instinct\r\nleading them to find sufficient shelter under the snow.\r\n\r\nBefore ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock all the travellers were crouching in the snow\r\nhouses, in groups of two or three, each choosing congenial companions.\r\nMrs Barnett, Madge, and Lieutenant Hobson occupied one hut, Thomas Black\r\nand Sergeant Long another, and so on. These retreats were warm, if not\r\ncomfortable; and the Esquimaux and Indians have no other refuge even in\r\nthe bitterest cold. The adventurers could therefore fearlessly await the\r\nend of the storm as long as they took care not to let the openings of\r\ntheir holes become blocked up with the snow, which they had to shovel\r\naway every half hour. So violent was the storm that even the Lieutenant\r\nand his soldiers could scarcely set foot outside. Fortunately, all were\r\nprovided with sufficient food, and were able to endure their beaver-like\r\nexistence without suffering from cold or hunger\r\n\r\nFor forty-eight hours the fury of the tempest continued to increase. The\r\nwind roared in the narrow pass, and tore off the tops of the icebergs.\r\nLoud reports, repeated twenty times by the echoes, gave notice of the\r\nfall of avalanches, and Jaspar Hobson began to fear that his further\r\nprogress would be barred by the masses of debris accumulated between\r\nthe mountains. Other sounds mingled with these reports, which Lieutenant\r\nHobson knew too well, and he did not disguise from Mrs Barnett that\r\nbears were prowling about the pass. But fortunately these terrible\r\nanimals were too much occupied with their own concerns to discover the\r\nretreat of the travellers; neither the dogs nor the sledges, buried in\r\nthe snow, attracted their attention, and they passed on without doing\r\nany harm.\r\n\r\nThe last night, that of the 25th or 26th May, was even more terrible. So\r\ngreat was the fury of the hurricane that a general overthrow of\r\nicebergs appeared imminent. A fearful death would then have awaited\r\nthe unfortunate travellers beneath the ruins of the broken masses. The\r\nblocks of ice cracked with an awful noise, and certain oscillations gave\r\nwarning that breaches had been made threatening their solidity. However,\r\nno great crash occurred, the huge mountains remained intact, and towards\r\nthe end of the night one of those sudden changes so frequent in the\r\nArctic regions took place; the tempest ceased suddenly beneath the\r\ninfluence of intense cold, and with the first dawn of day peace was\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE GREAT BEAR LAKE. This sudden increase of cold was most\r\nfortunate. Even in temperate climes there are generally three or four\r\nbitter days in May; and they were most serviceable now in consolidating\r\nthe freshly-fallen snow, and making it practicable for sledges.\r\nLieutenant Hobson, therefore, lost no time in resuming his journey,\r\nurging on the dogs to their utmost speed.\r\n\r\nThe route was, however, slightly changed. Instead of bearing due north,\r\nthe expedition advanced towards the west, following, so to speak, the\r\ncurve of the Arctic Circle. The Lieutenant was most anxious to reach\r\nFort Confidence, built on the northern extremity of the Great Bear Lake.\r\nThese few cold days were of the greatest service to him; he advanced\r\nrapidly, no obstacle was encountered, and his little troop arrived at\r\nthe factory on the 30th May.\r\n\r\nAt this time Forts Confidence and Good Hope were the most advanced\r\nposts of the Company in the north. Fort Confidence was a most important\r\nposition, built on the northern extremity of the lake, close to its\r\nwaters, which being frozen over in winter, and navigable in summer,\r\nafforded easy access to Fort Franklin, on the southern shores, and\r\npromoted the coming and going of the Indian hunters with their daily\r\nspoils. Many were the hunting and fishing expeditions which started from\r\nForts Confidence and Good Hope, especially from the former. The Great\r\nBear Lake is quite a Mediterranean Sea, extending over several\r\ndegrees of latitude and longitude. Its shape is very irregular : two\r\npromontories jut into it towards the centre, and the upper portion forms\r\na triangle; its appearance, as a whole, much resembling the extended\r\nskin of a ruminant without the head.\r\n\r\nFort Confidence was built at the end of the \xe2\x80\x9c right paw,\xe2\x80\x9d at least\r\ntwo hundred miles from Coronation Gulf, one of the numerous estuaries\r\nwhich irregularly indent the coast of North America. It was therefore\r\nsituated beyond the Arctic Circle, but three degrees south of the\r\nseventieth parallel, north of which the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company proposed\r\nforming a new settlement.\r\n\r\nFort Confidence, as a whole, much resembled other factories further\r\nsouth. It consisted of a house for the officers, barracks for the\r\nsoldiers, and magazines for the furs - all of wood, surrounded by\r\npalisades. The captain in command was then absent. He had gone towards\r\nthe east on a hunting expedition with a few Indians and soldiers. The\r\nlast season had not been good, costly furs had been scarce; but to make\r\nup for this the lake had supplied plenty of otter-skins. The stock of\r\nthem had, however, just been sent to the central factories in the south,\r\nso that the magazines of Fort Confidence were empty on the arrival of\r\nour party.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the Captain a Sergeant did the honours of the fort to\r\nJaspar Hobson and his companions. This second officer, Felton by name\r\nwas a brother-in-law of Sergeant Long. He showed the greatest readiness\r\nto assist the views of the Lieutenant, who being anxious to rest his\r\nparty, decided on remaining two or three days at Fort Confidence. In the\r\nabsence of the little garrison there was plenty of room, and dogs and\r\nmen were soon comfortably installed. The best room in the largest house\r\nwas of course given to Mrs Paulina Barnett, who was delighted with the\r\npoliteness of Sergeant Felton.\r\n\r\nJaspar Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s first care was to ask Felton if any Indians from the\r\nnorth were then beating the shores of the Great Bear Lake\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have just received\r\nnotice of the encampment of a party of Hare Indians on the other\r\nnorthern extremity of the lake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far from here?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout thirty miles,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sergeant Felton. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to\r\nenter into communication with these Indians?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson; they may be able to give me some valuable\r\ninformation about the districts bordering on the Arctic Ocean, and\r\nbounded by Cape Bathurst. Should the site be favourable, I propose\r\nconstructing our new fort somewhere about there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant, nothing is easier than to go to the Hare\r\nencampment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlong the shores of the lake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, across it; it is now free from ice, and the wind is favourable.\r\nWe will place a cutter and a boatman at your service, and in a few hours\r\nyou will be in the Indian settlement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sergeant; to-morrow, then.\xe2\x80\x9d Whenever you like,\r\nLieutenant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe start was fixed for the next morning; and when Mrs Paulina Barnett\r\nheard of the plan, she begged the Lieutenant to allow her to accompany\r\nhim, which of course he readily did.\r\n\r\nBut now to tell how the rest of this first day was passed. Mrs Barnett,\r\nHobson, two or three soldiers, Madge, Mrs Mac-Nab, and Joliffe explored\r\nthe shores of the lake under the guidance of Felton. The neighbourhood\r\nwas by no means barren of vegetation; the hills, now free from snow,\r\nwere crowned by resinous trees of the Scotch pine species. These trees,\r\nwhich attain a height of some forty feet, supply the inhabitants of the\r\nforts with plenty of fuel through the long winter. Their thick trunks\r\nand dark gloomy branches form a striking feature of the landscape; but\r\nthe regular clumps of equal height, sloping down to the very edge of the\r\nwater, are somewhat monotonous. Between the groups of trees the soil was\r\nclothed with a sort of whitish weed, which perfumed the air with a sweet\r\nthymy odour. Sergeant Felton informed his guests that this plant was\r\ncalled the \xe2\x80\x9c herb of incense \xe2\x80\x9c on account of the fragrance it emits\r\nwhen burnt.\r\n\r\nSome hundred steps from the fort the party came to a little natural\r\nharbour shut in by high granite rocks, which formed an admirable\r\nprotection from the heavy surf. Here was anchored the fleet of Fort\r\nConfidence, consisting of a single fishing-boat\xe2\x80\x94the very one which was\r\nto take Mrs Barnett and Hobson to the Indian encampment the next day.\r\nFrom this harbour an extensive view was obtained of the lake; its waters\r\nslightly agitated by the wind, with its irregular shores broken by\r\njagged capes and intersected by creeks. The wooded heights beyond, with\r\nhere and there the rugged outline of a floating iceberg standing out\r\nagainst the clear blue air, formed the background on the north; whilst\r\non the south a regular sea horizon, a circular line clearly cutting sky\r\nand water, and at this moment glittering in the sunbeams, bounded the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene was rich in animal and vegetable life. The surface of\r\nthe water, the shores strewn with flints and blocks of granite, the\r\nslopes with their tapestry of herbs, the tree-crowned hill-tops, were\r\nall alike frequented by various specimens of the feathered tribe.\r\nSeveral varieties of ducks, uttering their different cries and calls,\r\neider ducks, whistlers spotted redshanks, \xe2\x80\x9cold women,\xe2\x80\x9d those\r\nloquacious birds whose beak is never closed, skimmed the surface of the\r\nlake. Hundreds of puffins and guillemots with outspread wings darted\r\nabout in every direction, and beneath the trees strutted ospreys two\r\nfeet high-a kind of hawk with a grey body, blue beak and claws, and\r\norange-coloured eyes, which build their huge nests of marine plants in\r\nthe forked branches of trees. The hunter Sabine managed to bring down\r\na couple of these gigantic ospreys, which measured nearly six feet from\r\ntip to tip of their wings, and were therefore magnificent specimens of\r\nthese migratory birds, who feed entirely on fish, and take refuge on\r\nthe shores of the Gulf of Mexico when winter sets in, only visiting the\r\nhigher latitudes of North America during the short summer.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting event of the day was the capture of an otter,\r\nthe skin of which was worth several hundred roubles.\r\n\r\nThe furs of these valuable amphibious creatures were once much sought\r\nafter in China; and although the demand for them has considerably\r\ndecreased in the Celestial Empire, they still command very high prices\r\nin the Russian market. Russian traders, ready to buy up sea-otter skins,\r\ntravel all along the coasts of New Cornwall as far as the Arctic Ocean;\r\nand of course, thus hunted, the animal is becoming very rare. It has\r\ntaken refuge further and further north, and the trackers have now to\r\npursue it on the shores of the Kamtchatka Sea, and in the islands of the\r\nBehring Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sergeant Felton, after the preceding explanation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican inland otters are not to be despised, and those which\r\nfrequent the Great Bear Lake are worth from \xc2\xa350 to \xc2\xa360 each.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant was right; magnificent otters are found in these waters,\r\nand he himself skilfully tracked and killed one in the presence of his\r\nvisitors which was scarcely inferior in value to those from Kamtchatka\r\nitself. The creature measured three feet from the muzzle to the end of\r\nits tail; it had webbed feet, short legs, and its fur, darker on the\r\nupper than on the under part of its body, was long and silky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good shot, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lieutenant Hobson, who with Mrs\r\nBarnett had been attentively examining the magnificent fur of the dead\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cand if each day brought us\r\nsuch a skin as that, we should have nothing to complain of. But much\r\ntime is wasted in watching these animals, who swim and dive with\r\nmarvellous rapidity. We generally hunt them at night, as they very\r\nseldom venture from their homes in the trunks of trees or the holes of\r\nrocks in the daytime, and even expert hunters find it very difficult to\r\ndiscover their retreats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are these otters also becoming scarcer and scarcer?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nMrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cand when this species becomes\r\nextinct, the profits of the Company will sensibly decline. All the\r\nhunters try to obtain its fur, and the Americans in particular are\r\nformidable rivals to us. Did you not meet any American agents on your\r\njourney up, Lieutenant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9cDo they ever penetrate as far as\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes !\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cand when you hear of their\r\napproach, I advise you to be on your guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre these agents, then, highway robbers?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Paulina\r\nBarnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they are formidable\r\nrivals, and when game is scarce, hunters often come to blows about it. I\r\ndaresay that if the Company\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to establish a fort on the verge\r\nof the Arctic Ocean be successful, its example will at once be followed\r\nby these Americans, whom Heaven confound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cthe hunting districts are vast,\r\nand there\xe2\x80\x99s room beneath the sun for everybody. As for us, let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmake a start to begin with. Let us press on as long as we have firm\r\nground beneath our feet, and God be with us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a walk of three hours the visitors returned to Fort Confidence,\r\nwhere a good meal of fish and fresh venison awaited them. Sergeant Long\r\ndid the honours of the table, and after a little pleasant conversation,\r\nall retired to rest to forget their fatigues in a healthy and refreshing\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe next day, May 31st, Mrs Barnett and Jaspar Hobson were on foot at\r\nfive A.M. The Lieutenant intended to devote this day to visiting the\r\nIndian encampment, and obtaining as much useful information as possible.\r\nHe asked Thomas Black to go with him, but the astronomer preferred\r\nto remain on terra firma. He wished to make a few astronomical\r\nobservations, and to determine exactly the latitude and longitude of\r\nFort Confidence; so that Mrs Barnett and Jaspar Hobson had to cross the\r\nlake alone, under the guidance of an old boatman named Norman, who had\r\nlong been in the Company\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\n\r\nThe two travellers were accompanied by Sergeant Long as far as the\r\nlittle harbour, where they found old Norman ready to embark. Their\r\nlittle vessel was but an open fishing-boat, six feet long, rigged like\r\na cutter, which one man could easily manage. The weather was beautiful,\r\nand the slight breeze blowing from the north-east was favourable to the\r\ncrossing. Sergeant Felton took leave of his guests with many apologies\r\nfor being unable to accompany them in the absence of his chief. The boat\r\nwas let loose from its moorings, and tacking to starboard, shot across\r\nthe clear waters of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe little trip passed pleasantly enough. The taciturn old sailor sat\r\nsilent in the stern of the boat with the tiller tucked under his arm.\r\nMrs Barnett and Lieutenant Hobson, seated opposite to each other,\r\nexamined with interest the scenery spread out before them. The boat\r\nskirted the northern shores of the lake at about three miles\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndistance, following a rectilinear direction, so that the wooded heights\r\nsloping gradually to the west were distinctly visible. From this side\r\nthe district north of the lake appeared perfectly flat, and the horizon\r\nreceded to a considerable distance. The whole of this coast contrasted\r\nstrongly with the sharp angle, at the extremity of which rose Fort\r\nConfidence, framed in green pines. The flag of the Company was still\r\nvisible floating from the tower of the fort. The oblique rays of the sun\r\nlit up the surface of the water, and striking on the floating icebergs,\r\nseemed to convert them into molten silver of dazzling brightness. No\r\ntrace remained of the solid ice-mountains of the winter but these moving\r\nrelies, which the solar rays could scarcely dissolve, and which seemed,\r\nas it were, to protest against the brilliant but not very powerful Polar\r\nsun, now describing a diurnal arc of considerable length.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and the Lieutenant, as was their custom, communicated to\r\neach other the thoughts suggested by the strange scenes through which\r\nthey were passing. They laid up a store of pleasant recollections for\r\nthe future whilst the beat floated rapidly along upon the peaceful\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nThe party started at six in the morning, and at nine they neared the\r\npoint on the northern bank at which they were to land. The Indian\r\nencampment was situated at the north-west angle of the Great Bear Lake.\r\nBefore ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock old Norman ran the boat aground on a low bank at\r\nthe foot of a cliff of moderate height. Mrs Barnett and the Lieutenant\r\nlanded at once. Two or three Indians, with their chief, wearing gorgeous\r\nplumes, hastened to meet them, and addressed them in fairly intelligible\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThese Hare Indians, like the Copper and Beaver Indians, all belong to\r\nthe Chippeway race, and differ but little in customs and costumes\r\nfrom their fellow-tribes. They are in constant communication with the\r\nfactories, and have become, so to speak, \xe2\x80\x9cBritainised\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 at least\r\nas much so as is possible for savages. They bring the spoils of the\r\nchase to the forts, and there exchange them for the necessaries of life,\r\nwhich they no longer provide for themselves. They are in the pay of the\r\nCompany, they live upon it, and it is not surprising that they have lost\r\nall originality. To find a native race as yet uninfluenced by contact\r\nwith Europeans we must go to still higher latitudes, to the ice-bound\r\nregions frequented by the Esquimaux, who, like the Greenlanders, are the\r\ntrue children of Arctic lands.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and Jaspar Hobson accompanied the Indians to their camp,\r\nabout half a mile from the shore, and found some thirty natives there,\r\nmen, women, and children, who supported themselves by hunting and\r\nfishing on the borders of the lake. These Indians had just come from the\r\nnorthernmost districts of the American continent, and were able to\r\ngive the Lieutenant some valuable, although necessarily incomplete,\r\ninformation on the actual state of the sea-coast near the seventieth\r\nparallel. The Lieutenant heard with considerable satisfaction that a\r\nparty of Americans or Europeans had been seen on the confines of\r\nthe Polar Sea, and that it was open at this time of year. About Cape\r\nBathurst, properly so called, the point for which he intended to make,\r\nthe Hare Indians could tell him nothing. Their chief said, however,\r\nthat the district between the Great Bear Lake and Cape Bathurst was\r\nvery difficult to cross, being hilly and intersected by streams, at this\r\nseason of the year free from ice. He advised the Lieutenant to go down\r\nthe Coppermine river, from the north-east of the lake, which would take\r\nhim to the coast by the shortest route. Once at the Arctic Ocean, it\r\nwould be easy to skirt along its shores and to choose the best spot at\r\nWhich to halt.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson thanked the Indian chief, and took leave after giving\r\nhim a few presents. Then accompanied by Mrs Barnett, he explored the\r\nneighbourhood of the camp, not returning to the boat until nearly three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. A STORM ON THE LAKE. The old sailor was impatiently awaiting\r\nthe return of the travellers; for during the last hour the weather had\r\nchanged, and the appearance of the sky was calculated to render any one\r\naccustomed to read the signs of the clouds uneasy. The sun was obscured\r\nby a thick mist, the wind had fallen, but - an ominous moaning was heard\r\nfrom the south of the lake. These symptoms of an approaching change\r\nof temperature were developed with all the rapidity peculiar to these\r\nelevated latitudes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be off, sir! let us be off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried old Norman, looking\r\nanxiously at the fog above his head. \xe2\x80\x9c Let us start without losing an\r\ninstant. There are terrible signs in the air!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe appearance of the sky is\r\nquite changed, and we never noticed it, Mrs Barnett!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid of a storm?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the lady of old Norman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cand the storms on the Great\r\nBear Lake are often terrible. The hurricane rages as if upon the open\r\nAtlantic Ocean. This sudden fog bodes us no good; but the tempest may\r\nhold back for three or four hours, and by that time we shall be at Fort\r\nConfidence. Let us then start without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay, for the boat\r\nwould not be safe near these rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant, feeling that the old man, accustomed as he was to\r\nnavigate these waters, was better able to judge than himself, decided to\r\nfollow his advice, and embarked at once with Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\nBut just as they were pushing off, old Norman, as if possessed by some\r\nsudden presentiment, murmured \xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it would be better to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson overheard these words, and looked inquiringly at the\r\nold boatman, already seated at the helm. Had he been alone he would not\r\nhave hesitated to start, but as Mrs Barnett was with him caution was\r\nnecessary. The lady at once saw and understood his hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about me, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cact as if I were not\r\npresent. Let us start immediately , as our brave guide suggests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are off, then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Norman, letting go the moorings, \xe2\x80\x9cto the\r\nfort by the shortest route.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor about an hour the bark made little head. The sail, scarcely filled\r\nby the fitful breeze, flapped against the mast. The fog became thicker.\r\nThe waves began to rise and the boat to rock considerably; for the\r\napproaching hurricane affected the water sooner than the atmosphere\r\nitself. The two travellers sat still and silent, whilst the old\r\nsailor peered into the darkness with bloodshot eyes. Prepared for\r\nall contingencies, he awaited the shock of the wind, ready to pay out\r\nrapidly should the attack be very violent. The conflict of the elements\r\nhad not, however, as yet commenced; and all would have been well if they\r\nbad been able to advance, but after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s sail they were still\r\nonly about two hours\xe2\x80\x99 distance from the Indian encampment. A few gusts\r\nof wind from the shore drove them out of their course, and the dense fog\r\nrendered it impossible for them to make out the coast-line. Should the\r\nwind settle in the north it would probably go hard with the light boat,\r\nwhich, unable to hold its own course, would be drifted out into the lake\r\nno one knew where.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are scarcely advancing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant to old\r\nNorman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Norman; \xe2\x80\x9cthe wind is not strong enough to fill\r\nthe sail, and if it were, I fear it comes from the wrong quarter. If\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to the south, \xe2\x80\x9cwe may see Fort Franklin\r\nbefore Fort Confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cour trip will have been all\r\nthe more complete. This is a magnificent lake, well worth exploring from\r\nnorth to south. I suppose, Norman, one might get back even from Fort\r\nFranklin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam, if we ever reach it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\ntempests lasting fifteen days are by no means rare on this lake; and\r\nif our bad luck should drive us to the south, it may be a month before\r\nLieutenant Hobson again sees Fort Confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be careful, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cfor such a delay,\r\nwould hinder our projects very much. Do the best you can under the\r\ncircumstances, and if you think it would be prudent, go back to the\r\nnorth. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose Mrs Barnett would mind a walk of twenty or\r\ntwenty-five miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should be glad enough to go back to the north, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nNorman, \xe2\x80\x9cif it were still possible. But look, the wind seems likely\r\nto settle against us. All I can attempt is to get to the cape on the\r\nnorth-east, and if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t blow too hard, I hope to succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at about half-past four the storm broke. The shrill whistling of the\r\nwind was heard far above their heads, but the state of the atmosphere\r\nprevented it from as yet descending upon the lake; this was, however,\r\nonly delayed for a brief space of time. The cries of frightened birds\r\nflying through the fog mingled with the noise of the wind. Suddenly the\r\nmist was torn open, and revealed low jagged masses of rain-cloud chased\r\ntowards the south. The fears of the old sailor were realised. The wind\r\nblew from the north, and it was not long before the travellers learned\r\nthe meaning of a squall upon the lake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out!\xe2\x80\x9d cried old Norman, tightening sail so as to get his boat\r\nahead of the wind, whilst keeping her under control of the helm.\r\n\r\nThe squall came. It caught the boat upon the flank, and it was turned\r\nover on its side; but recovering itself, it was flung upon the crest\r\nof a wave. The billows surged as if upon an open sea. The waters of the\r\nlake not being very deep, struck against the bottom and rebounded to an\r\nimmense height.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp! help!\xe2\x80\x9d cried old Norman, hurriedly struggling to haul down\r\nhis sail.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and Hobson endeavoured to come to his assistance, but\r\nwithout success, for they knew noticing of the management of a boat.\r\nNorman, unable to leave the helm, and the halliards being entangled at\r\nthe top of the mast, could not take in the sail. Every moment the boat\r\nthreatened to capsize, and heavy seas broke over its sides. The\r\nsky became blacker and blacker, cold rain mingled with snow fell in\r\ntorrents, whilst the squall redoubled its fury, lashing the crests of\r\nthe waves into foam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut it! cut it!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Norman above the roaring of the storm.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant, his cap blown away and his eyes blinded by the spray,\r\nseized Norman\xe2\x80\x99s knife and cut the halliard like a harp-string; but the\r\nwet cordage no longer acted in the grooves of the pulleys, and the yard\r\nremained attached to the top of the mast.\r\n\r\nNorman, totally unable to make head against the wind, now resolved to\r\ntack about for the south, dangerous as it would be to have the boat\r\nbefore the wind, pursued by waves advancing at double its speed. Yes, to\r\ntack, although this course would probably bring them all to the southern\r\nshores of the lake, far away from their destination.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant and his brave companion were well aware of the danger\r\nwhich threatened them. The frail boat could not long resist the blows\r\nof the waves, it would either be crushed or capsized; the lives of those\r\nwithin it were in the hands of God.\r\n\r\nBut neither yielded to despair; clinging to the sides of the boat, wet\r\nto the skin, chilled to the bone by the cutting blast, they strove\r\nto gaze through the thick mist and fog. All trace of the land had\r\ndisappeared, and so great was the obscurity that at a cable\xe2\x80\x99s length\r\nfrom the boat clouds and waves could not be distinguished from each\r\nother. Now and then the two travellers looked inquiringly into old\r\nNorman\xe2\x80\x99s face, who, with teeth set and hands clutching the tiller;\r\ntried to keep his boat as much as possible under wind.\r\n\r\nBut the violence of the squall became such that the boat could not long\r\nmaintain this course. The waves which struck its bow would soon have\r\ninevitably crushed it; the front planks were already beginning to\r\nseparate, and when its whole weight was flung into the hollows of the\r\nwaves it seemed as if it could rise no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must tack, we must tack, whatever happens !\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the old\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\nAnd pushing the tiller and paying out sail, he turned the head of the\r\nboat to the south. The sail, stretched to the utmost, brought the boat\r\nround with giddy rapidity, and the immense waves, chased by the wind,\r\nthreatened to engulf the little bark. This was the great danger of\r\nshifting with the wind right aft. The billows hurled themselves in rapid\r\nsuccession upon the boat, which could not evade them. It filled rapidly,\r\nand the water bad to be baled out without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, or it must\r\nhave foundered. As they got nearer and nearer to the middle of the lake\r\nthe waves became rougher. Nothing there broke the fury of the wind; no\r\nclumps of trees, no hills, checked for a moment the headlong course of\r\nthe hurricane. Now and then momentary glimpses were obtained through the\r\nfog of icebergs dancing like buoys upon the waves, and driven towards\r\nthe south of the lake.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past five. Neither Norman nor the Lieutenant had any idea of\r\nwhere they were, or whither they were going. They had lost all control\r\nover the boat, and were at the mercy of the winds and waves.\r\n\r\nAnd now at about a hundred feet behind the boat a huge wave upreared its\r\nfoam-crowned crest, whilst in front a black whirlpool was formed by the\r\nsudden sinking of the water. All surface agitation, crushed by the\r\nwind, had disappeared around this awful gulf, which, growing deeper and\r\nblacker every moment, drew the devoted little vessel towards its fatal\r\nembrace. Ever nearer came the mighty wave, all lesser billows sinking\r\ninto insignificance before it. It gained upon the boat, another moment\r\nand it would crush it to atoms. Norman, looking round, saw its approach;\r\nand Mrs Barnett and the Lieutenant, with eyes fixed and staring, awaited\r\nin fearful suspense the blow from which there was no escape. The wave\r\nbroke over them with the noise of thunder; it enveloped the stern of the\r\nboat in foam, a fearful crash was heard, and a cry burst from the lips\r\nof the Lieutenant and his companion, smothered beneath the liquid mass.\r\n\r\nThey thought that all was over, and that the boat had sunk; but no, it\r\nrose once more, although more than half filled with water.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant uttered a cry of despair. Where was Norman? The poor old\r\nsailor had disappeared !\r\n\r\nMrs Paulina Barnett looked inquiringly at Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorman!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, pointing to his empty place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy man !\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs Barnett; and at the risk of being flung\r\nfrom the boat rocking on the waves, the two started to their feet and\r\nlooked around them. But they could see and hear nothing. No cry for help\r\nbroke upon their ears. No dead body floated in the white foam. The old\r\nsailor had met his death in the element he loved so well.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and Hobson sank back upon their seats. They were now alone,\r\nand must see to their own safety; but neither of them knew anything of\r\nthe management of a boat, and even an experienced hand could scarcely\r\nhave controlled it now. They were at the mercy of the waves, and the\r\nbark, with distended sail, swept along in mad career. What could the\r\nLieutenant do to check or direct its course?\r\n\r\nWhat a terrible situation for our travellers, to be thus overtaken by a\r\ntempest in a frail bark which they could not manage !\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are lost!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9clet us make another\r\neffort. Heaven helps those who help themselves !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson now for the first time realised with how intrepid a\r\nwoman fate had thrown him.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to get rid of the water which weighed\r\ndown the boat. Another wave shipped would have filled it in a moment,\r\nand it must have sunk at once. The vessel lightened, it would have a\r\nbetter chance of rising on the waves; and the two set to work to bale\r\nout the water. This was no easy task; for fresh waves constantly broke\r\nover them, and the scoop could not be laid aside for an instant. Mrs\r\nBarnett was indefatigable, and the Lieutenant, leaving the baling to\r\nher, took the helm himself, and did the best he could to guide the boat\r\nwith the wind right aft.\r\n\r\nTo add to the danger, night, or rather darkness, for in these latitudes\r\nnight only lasts a few hours at this time of year, fell upon them.\r\nScarce a ray of light penetrated through the heavy clouds and fog. They\r\ncould not see two yards before them, and the boat must have been dashed\r\nto pieces had it struck a floating iceberg. This danger was indeed\r\nimminent, for the loose ice-masses advance with such rapidity that it is\r\nimpossible to get out of their way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no control over the helm?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett in a slight\r\nlull of the storm.\r\n\r\nNo, madam he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand you must prep are for the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the courageous woman simply.\r\n\r\nAs she spoke a loud rippling sound was heard. The sail, torn away by the\r\nwind, disappeared like a white cloud. The boat sped rapidly along for\r\na few instants, and then stopped suddenly, the waves buffeting it about\r\nlike an abandoned wreck. Mrs Barnett and Hobson, flung to the bottom of\r\nthe boat, bruised, shaken, and torn, felt that all was lost. Not a shred\r\nof canvas was left to aid in navigating the craft; and what with the\r\nspray, the snow, and the rain, they could scarcely see each other,\r\nwhilst the uproar drowned their voices. Expecting every moment to\r\nperish, they remained for an hour in painful suspense, commending\r\nthemselves to God, who alone could save them.\r\n\r\nNeither of them could have said how long they waited when they were\r\naroused by a violent shock.\r\n\r\nThe boat had just struck an enormous iceberg, a floating block with\r\nrugged, slippery sides, to which it would be impossible to cling.\r\n\r\nAt this sudden blow, which could not have been parried, the bow of the\r\nboat was split open, and the water poured into it in torrents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are sinking! we are sinking !\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jasper Hobson.\r\n\r\nHe was right. The boat was settling down; the water had already reached\r\nthe seats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, madam, I am here! I will not leave you!\xe2\x80\x9d added the\r\nLieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett : \xe2\x80\x9calone, you may save yourself;\r\ntogether, we should perish. Leave me! leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson.\r\n\r\nBut he had scarcely pronounced this word when the boat, struck by\r\nanother wave, filled and sank.\r\n\r\nBoth were drawn under water by the eddy caused by the sudden settling\r\ndown of the boat, but in a few instants they rose to the surface.\r\nHobson was a strong swimmer, and struck out with one arm, supporting\r\nhis companion with the other. But it was evident that he could not long\r\nsustain a conflict with the furious waves, and that he must perish with\r\nher he wished to save.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a strange sound attracted his attention. It was not the\r\ncry of a frightened bird, but the shout of a human voice! By one supreme\r\neffort Hobson raised himself above the waves and looked around him.\r\n\r\nBut he could distinguish nothing in the thick fog. And yet he again\r\nbeard cries, this time nearer to him. Some bold men were coming to his\r\nsuccour! Alas! if it were so, they would arrive too late. Encumbered by\r\nhis clothes, the Lieutenant felt himself sinking with the unfortunate\r\nlady, whose head he could scarcely keep above the water. With a last\r\ndespairing effort he uttered a heartrending cry and disappeared beneath\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, no mistake-he had heard voices. Three men, wandering\r\nabout by the lake, had seen the boat in danger, and put off to its\r\nrescue. They were Esquimaux, the only men who could have hoped to\r\nweather such a storm, for theirs are the only boats constructed to\r\nescape destruction in these fearful tempests.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux boat or kayak is a long pirogue raised at each end, made\r\nof a light framework of wood, covered with stretched seal-skins strongly\r\nstitched with the sinews of the Walrus. In the upper part of the boat;\r\nalso covered with skins, is an opening in which the Esquimaux takes his\r\nplace, fastening his waterproof jacket to the back of his seat; so\r\nthat he is actually joined to his bark, which not a drop of water can\r\npenetrate. This light, easily-managed kayak, floating as it does, on\r\nthe crests of the waves, can never be submerged; and if it be sometimes\r\ncapsized, a blow of the paddle rights it again directly; so that it\r\nis able to live and make way in seas in which any other boat would\r\ncertainly be dashed to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe three Esquimaux, guided by the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s last despairing\r\ncry, arrived at the scene of the wreck joints in time. Hobson and Mrs\r\nBarnett, already half drowned, felt themselves drawn up by powerful\r\nhands; but in the darkness they were unable to discover who were their\r\ndeliverers. One of the men took the Lieutenant and laid him across his\r\nown boat, another did the sane for Mrs Barnett, and the three kayaks,\r\nskilfully managed with the paddles, six feet long, sped rapidly over the\r\nwhite foam.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards, the shipwrecked travellers were lying on the\r\nsandy beach three miles above Fort Providence.\r\n\r\nThe old sailor alone was missing !\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. A RETROSPECT. It was about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the same night when\r\nMrs Barnett and Lieutenant Hobson knocked at the postern gate of the\r\nfort. Great was the joy on seeing them, for they had been given up for\r\nlost; but this joy was turned to mourning at the news of the death\r\nof Norman. The brave fellow had been beloved by all, and his loss\r\nwas sincerely mourned. The intrepid and devoted Esquimaux received\r\nphlegmatically the earnest expressions of gratitude of those they had\r\nsaved, and coulot be persuaded to come to the fort. What they had done\r\nseemed to them only natural, and these were not the first persons they\r\nhad rescued; so they quietly returned to their wild life of adventure on\r\nthe lake, where they hunted the otters and water-birds day and night.\r\n\r\nFor the next three nights the party rested. Hobson always intended to\r\nset out on June 2d; and on that day, all having recovered from their\r\nfatigues and the storm having abated, the order was given to start.\r\n\r\nSergeant Felton had done all in his power to make his guests comfortable\r\nand to aid their enterprise; some of the jaded dogs were replaced by\r\nfresh animals, and now the Lieutenant found all his sledges drawn up in\r\ngood order at the door of the enceinte, and awaiting the travellers.\r\n\r\nThe adieux were soon over. Each one thanked Sergeant Felton for his\r\nhospitality, and Mrs Paulina Barnett was most profuse in her expressions\r\nof gratitude. A hearty shake of the hand between the Sergeant and his\r\nbrother-in-law, Long, completed the leave-taking,\r\n\r\nEach pair got into the sledge assigned to them; but this time Mrs\r\nBarnett and the Lieutenant shared one vehicle, Madge and Sergeant Long\r\nfollowing them.\r\n\r\nAccording to the advice of the Indian chief, Hobson determined to get to\r\nthe coast by the shortest route, and to take a north-easterly direction.\r\nAfter consulting, his map, which merely gave a rough outline of the\r\nconfiguration of the country, it seemed best to him to descend the\r\nvalley of the Coppermine, a large river which flows into Coronation\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\nThe distance between Fort Confidence and the mouth of this river is only\r\na degree and a half-that is to say, about eighty-five or ninety miles.\r\nThe deep hollow formed by the gulf is bounded on the north by Cape\r\nKrusenstein, and from it the coast juts out towards the north-west,\r\nending in Cape Bathurst, which is above the seventieth parallel.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant, therefore, now changed the route he had hitherto\r\nfollowed, directing his course to the east, so as to reach the river in\r\na few hours.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the next day, June 3d, the river was gained. It was\r\nnow free from ice, and its clear and rapid waters flowed through a vast\r\nvalley, intersected by numerous but easily fordable streams. The\r\nsledges advanced pretty rapidly, and as they went along, Hobson gave his\r\ncompanion some account of the country through which they were passing. A\r\nsincere friendship founded on mutual esteem, had sprung up between these\r\ntwo. Mrs Paulina Barnett was an earnest student with a special gift for\r\ndiscovery, and was therefore always glad to converse with travellers and\r\nexplorers. Hobson, who knew his beloved North America by heart, was able\r\nto answer all her inquiries fully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout ninety years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe territory through which\r\nthe Coppermine flows was unknown, and we are indebted for its discovery\r\nto the agents of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company. But as always happens in\r\nscientific matters, in seeking one thing, another was found. Columbus\r\nwas trying to find Asia, and discovered America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what were the agents of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company seeking? The\r\nfamous North-West Passage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young Lieutenant. \xe2\x80\x9cA century ago the\r\nCompany had no interest in the opening of a new route, which would have\r\nbeen more valuable to its rivals than to it. It is even said that in\r\n1741 a certain Christopher Middleton, sent to explore these latitudes,\r\nwas publicly charged with receiving a bribe of \xc2\xa3500 from the Company\r\nto say that there was not, and could not be, a sea passage between the\r\noceans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not much to the credit of the celebrated Company,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not defend it in the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cand its\r\ninterference was severely censured by Parliament in 1746, when a reward\r\nof \xc2\xa320,000 was offered by the Government for the discovery of the\r\npassage in question. In that year two intrepid explorers, William Moor\r\nand Francis Smith, penetrated as far as Repulse Bay in the hope of\r\ndiscovering the much-longed-for passage. But they were unsuccessful, and\r\nreturned to England after an absence of a year and a half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut did not other captains follow in their steps, resolved to conquer\r\nwhere they had failed?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam; and in spite of the large reward offered by Parliament, no\r\nattempt was made to resume explorations in English America until thirty\r\nyears afterwards, when some agents of the Company took up the unfinished\r\ntask of Captains Moor and Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Company had then relinquished the narrow-minded egotistical\r\nposition it had taken up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam, not yet. Samuel Hearne, the agent, only went to\r\nreconnoitre the position of a copper-mine which native miners had\r\nreported. On November 6, 1769, this agent left Fort Prince of Wales,\r\non the river Churchill, near the western shores of Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay. He\r\npressed boldly on to the north-west; but the excessive cold and\r\nthe exhaustion of his provisions compelled him to return without\r\naccomplishing anything. Fortunately he was not easily discouraged, and\r\non February 23d of the next year he set out again, this time taking some\r\nIndians with him. Great hardships were endured in this second journey.\r\nThe fish and game on which Hearne had relied often failed him; and\r\nhe had once nothing to eat for seven days but wild fruit, bits of old\r\nleather, and burnt bones. He was again compelled to return to the fort\r\na disappointed man. But he did not even yet despair, and started a third\r\ntime, December 7th, 1770; and after a struggle of nineteen months, he\r\ndiscovered the Coppermine river, July 13th, 1772, the course of which\r\nhe followed to its mouth. According to his own account, he saw the open\r\nsea, and in any case he was the first to penetrate to the northern coast\r\nof America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the North-West Passage-that is to say, the direct communication\r\nby sea between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\xe2\x80\x94was not then\r\ndiscovered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cand what countless\r\nadventurous sailors have since gone to seek it! Phipps in 1773, James\r\nCook and Clerke in 1776 to 1779, Kotzebue in 1815 to 1818, Ross, Parry,\r\nFranklin, and others have attempted this difficult task; but it was\r\nreserved to M\xe2\x80\x99Clure in our own day to pass from one ocean to the other\r\nacross the Polar Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant, that was a geographical discovery of which we\r\nEnglish may well be proud. But do tell me if the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company\r\ndid not adopt more generous views, and send out some other explorer\r\nafter the return of Hearne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt did, madam; and it was thanks to it that Captain Franklin was able\r\nto accomplish his voyage of 1819 to 1822 between the river discovered\r\nby Hearne and Cape Turnagain. This expedition endured great fatigue and\r\nhardships; provisions often completely failed, and two Canadians were\r\nassassinated and eaten by their comrades. But in spite of all his\r\nsufferings, Captain Franklin explored no less than five thousand\r\nfive hundred and fifty miles of the hitherto unknown coast of North\r\nAmerica!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was indeed a man of energy,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cand he gave\r\nproof of his great qualities in starting on a fresh Polar expedition\r\nafter all he had gone through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cand he met a terrible death in\r\nthe land his own intrepidity had discovered. It has now been proved,\r\nhowever, that all his companions did not perish with him. Many are\r\ndoubtless still wandering about on the vast ice-fields. I cannot\r\nthink of their awful condition without a shudder. One day,\xe2\x80\x9d be added\r\nearnestly, and with strange emotion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d one day I will search the\r\nunknown lands where the dreadful catastrophe took place, and\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett, pressing his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI will accompany\r\nyou. Yes, this idea has occurred to me more than once, as it has to\r\nyou; and my heart beats high when I think that fellow countrymen of my\r\nown-Englishmen-are awaiting succour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich will come too late for most of them, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nLieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cbut rest assured some will even yet be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it, Lieutenant!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cand it appears\r\nto me that the agents of the Company, living as they do close to the\r\ncoast, are better fitted than any one else to fulfil this duty of\r\nhumanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you, madam; they are, as they have often proved, inured\r\nto the rigours of the Arctic climate. Was it not they who aided Captain\r\nBack in his voyage in 1834, when he discovered King William\xe2\x80\x99s Land,\r\nwhere Franklin met his fate? Was it not two of us, Dease and Simpson,\r\nwho were sent by the Governor of Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay to explore the shores\r\nof the Polar Sea in 1838, and whose courageous efforts first discovered\r\nVictoria Land? It is my opinion that the future reserves for the\r\nHudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company the final conquest of the Arctic regions.\r\nGradually its factories are advancing further and further north,\r\nfollowing the retreat of the fur-yielding animals; and one day a fort\r\nwill be erected on the Pole itself, that mathematical point where meet\r\nall the meridians of the globe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this and the succeeding journeys Jaspar Hobson related his own\r\nadventures since he entered the service of the Company his struggles\r\nwith the agents of rival associations, and his efforts to explore the\r\nunknown districts of the north or west; and Mrs Barnett, on her side,\r\ntold of her travels in the tropics. She spoke of all she had done, and\r\nof all she hoped still to accomplish; so that the long hours, lightened\r\nby pleasant conversation, passed rapidly away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the dogs advanced at full gallop towards the north. The\r\nCoppermine valley widened sensibly as they neared the Arctic Ocean. The\r\nhills on either side sank lower and lower, and only scattered clumps of\r\nresinous trees broke the monotony of the landscape. A few blocks of ice,\r\ndrifted down by the river, still resisted the action of the sun; but\r\neach day their number decreased, and a canoe, or even a good-sized\r\nboat, might easily have descended the stream, the course of which was\r\nunimpeded by any natural barrier or aggregation of rocks. The bed of the\r\nCoppermine was both deep and wide; its waters were very clear, and\r\nbeing fed by the melted snow, flowed on at a considerable pace, never,\r\nhowever, forming dangerous rapids. Its course, at first very sinuous,\r\nbecame gradually less and less winding, and at last stretched along in a\r\nstraight line for several miles. Its banks, composed of fine firm sand,\r\nand clothed in part with short dry herbage, were wide and level, so that\r\nthe long train of sledges sped rapidly over them.\r\n\r\nThe expedition travelled day and night-if we can speak of the night,\r\nwhen the sun, describing an almost horizontal circle, scarcely\r\ndisappeared at all. The true night only lasted two hours, and the dawn\r\nsucceeded the twilight almost immediately. The weather was fine; the sky\r\nclear, although somewhat misty on the horizon; and everything combined\r\nto favour the travellers.\r\n\r\nFor two days they kept along the river-banks without meeting with any\r\ndifficulties. They saw but few fur-bearing animals; but there were\r\nplenty of birds, which might have been counted by thousands. The absence\r\nof otters, sables, beavers, ermines, foxes, &c., did not trouble the\r\nLieutenant much, for he supposed that they had been driven further\r\nnorth by over-zealous tracking; and indeed the marks of encampments,\r\nextinguished fires, &c., told of the more or less recent passage of\r\nnative hunters. Hobson knew that he would have to penetrate a good deal\r\nfurther north, and that part only of his journey would be accomplished\r\nwhen he got to the mouth of the Coppermine river. He was therefore most\r\neager to reach the limit of Hearne\xe2\x80\x99s exploration, and pressed on as\r\nrapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nEvery one shared the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s impatience, and resolutely resisted\r\nfatigue in order to reach the Arctic Ocean with the least possible\r\ndelay. They were drawn onwards by an indefinable attraction; the glory\r\nof the unknown dazzled their sight. Probably real hardships would\r\ncommence when they did arrive at the much-desired coast. But no matter,\r\nthey longed to battle with difficulties, and to press straight onwards\r\nto their aim. The district they were now traversing could have no direct\r\ninterest for them; the real exploration would only commence on the\r\nshores of the Arctic Ocean. Each one, then, would gladly hail the\r\narrival in the elevated western districts for which they were bound, cut\r\nacross though they were by the seventieth parallel of north latitude.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th June, four days after leaving Fort Confidence the river\r\nwidened considerably. The western banks, curving slightly, ran almost\r\ndue north; whilst the eastern rounded off into the coastline, stretching\r\naway as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson paused, and waving his hand to his companions, pointed\r\nto the boundless ocean.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. ALONG THE COAST. Coronation Gulf, the large estuary dotted\r\nwith the islands forming the Duke of York Archipelago, which the party\r\nhad now reached, was a sheet of water with irregular banks, let in, as\r\nit were, into the North American continent. At its western angle opened\r\nthe mouth of the Coppermine; and on the east a long narrow creek called\r\nBathurst Inlet ran into the mainland, from which stretched the jagged\r\nbroken coast with its pointed capes and rugged promontories, ending\r\nin that confusion of straits, sounds, and channels which gives such a\r\nstrange appearance to the maps of North America. On the other side the\r\ncoast turned abruptly to the north beyond the mouth of the Coppermine\r\nRiver, and ended in Cape Krusenstern.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with Sergeant Long, Lieutenant Hobson decided to give\r\nhis party a day\xe2\x80\x99s rest here.\r\n\r\nThe exploration, properly so called, which was to enable the Lieutenant\r\nto fix upon a suitable site for the establishment of a fort, was now\r\nreally about to begin. The Company had advised him to keep as much as\r\npossible above the seventieth parallel, and on the shores of the Arctic\r\nOcean. To obey his orders Hobson was obliged to keep to the west; for on\r\nthe east\xe2\x80\x94with the exception, perhaps, of the land of Boothia, crossed\r\nby the seventieth parallel\xe2\x80\x94the whole country belongs rather to the\r\nArctic Circle, and the geographical conformation of Boothia is as yet\r\nbut imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully ascertaining the latitude and longitude, and verifying\r\nhis position by the map, the Lieutenant found that he was a hundred\r\nmiles below the seventieth degree. But beyond Cape Krusenstern, the\r\ncoast-line, running in a north-easterly direction, abruptly crosses the\r\nseventieth parallel at a sharp angle near the one hundred and thirtieth\r\nmeridian, and at about the same elevation as Cape Bathurst, the spot\r\nnamed as a rendezvous by Captain Craventy. He must therefore make for\r\nthat point, and should the site appear suitable the new fort would be\r\nerected there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant to his subordinate, Long, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall\r\nbe in the position ordered by the Company. There the sea, open for a\r\ngreat part of the year, will allow the vessels from Behring Strait to\r\ncome right up to the fort, bringing us fresh provisions and taking away\r\nour commodities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to mention,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sergeant Long, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our men will be\r\nentitled to double pay all the time they are beyond the seventieth\r\nparallel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course that is understood,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cand I daresay\r\nthey will accept it without a murmur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long simply, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have now only to\r\nstart for Cape Bathurst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as a day of rest had been promised, the start did not actually take\r\nplace until the next day, June 6th.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the journey would naturally be very different from\r\nthe first. The rules with regard to the sledges keeping their rank need\r\nno longer be enforced, and each couple drove as it pleased them. Only\r\nshort distances were traversed at a time; halts were made at every angle\r\nof the coast, and the party often walked. Lieutenant Hobson only urged\r\ntwo things upon his companions not to go further than three miles from\r\nthe coast, and to rally their forces twice a day, at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nand in the evening. At night they all encamped in tents.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued very fine and the temperature moderate,\r\nmaintaining a mean height of 59\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit above zero. Two or three\r\ntimes sudden snowstorms came on; but they did not last long, and\r\nexercised no sensible influence upon the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the American coast between Capes Krusenstern and Parry,\r\ncomprising an extent of more than two hundred and fifty miles, was\r\nexamined with the greatest care between the 6th and 20th of June.\r\nGeographical observations were accurately taken, and Hobson, most\r\neffectively aided by Thomas Black, was able to rectify certain errors\r\nin previous marine surveys; whilst the primary object of the\r\nexpedition\xe2\x80\x94the examination into the quality and quantity of the game\r\nin the surrounding districts-was not neglected.\r\n\r\nWere these lands well stocked with game? Could they count with certainty\r\nnot only on a good supply of furs, but also of meat? Would the resources\r\nof the country provide a fort with provisions in the summer months at\r\nleast? Such were the grave questions which Lieutenant Hobson had to\r\nsolve, and which called for immediate attention. We give a summary of\r\nthe conclusions at which he arrived.\r\n\r\nGame, properly so called, of the kind for which Corporal Joliffe amongst\r\nothers had a special predilection, was not abundant. There were plenty\r\nof birds of the duck tribe; but only a few Polar hares, difficult of\r\napproach, poorly represented the rodents of the north. There seemed,\r\nhowever, to be a good many bears about. Marbre and Sabine had come upon\r\nthe fresh traces of several. Some were even seen and tracked; but, as a\r\nrule, they kept at a respectful distance. In the winter, however, driven\r\nby famine from higher latitudes, there would probably be more than\r\nenough of these ravenous beasts prowling about the shores of the Arctic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is certainly no denying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corporal Joliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nbear\xe2\x80\x99s flesh is very good eating when once it\xe2\x80\x99s in the larder; but\r\nthere is something very problematical about it beforehand, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways just possible that the hunters themselves may meet the fate they\r\nintended for the bears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was true enough. It was no use counting upon the bears to provision\r\ntheir fort. Fortunately traces were presently found of herds of a far\r\nmore useful animal, the flesh of which is the principal food of the\r\nIndians and Esquimaux. We allude to the reindeer; and Corporal Joliffe\r\nannounced with the greatest satisfaction that there were plenty of these\r\nruminants on this coast. The ground was covered with the lichen to which\r\nthey are so partial, and which they cleverly dig out from under the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nThere could be no mistake as to the footprints left by the reindeer, as,\r\nlike the camel, they have a small nail-like hoof with a convex surface.\r\nLarge herds, sometimes numbering several thousand animals, are seen\r\nrunning wild in certain parts of America. Being easily domesticated,\r\nthey are employed to draw sledges; and they also supply the factories\r\nwith excellent milk, more nourishing than that of cows. Their dead\r\nbodies are not less useful. Their thick skin provides clothes, their\r\nhair makes very good thread, and their flesh is palatable; so that they\r\nare really the most valuable animals to be found in these latitudes,\r\nand Hobson, being assured of their presence, was relieved from half his\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced he had also reason to be satisfied with regard to the\r\nfur-bearing animals. By the little streams rose many beaver lodges\r\nand musk-rat tunnels. Badgers, lynxes, ermines, wolverenes, sables,\r\npolecats, &c., frequented these districts, hitherto undisturbed by\r\nhunters. They had thus far come to no trace of the presence of man, and\r\nthe animals had chosen their refuge well. Footprints were also found of\r\nthe fine blue and silver foxes, which are becoming more and more rare,\r\nand the fur of which is worth its weight in gold. Sabine and Mac-Nab\r\nmight many a time have shot a very valuable animal on this excursion,\r\nbut the Lieutenant had wisely forbidden all hunting of the kind. He did\r\nnot wish to alarm the animals before the approaching season-that is to\r\nsay, before the winter months, when their furs become thicker and\r\nmore beautiful. It was also desirable not to overload the sledges. The\r\nhunters saw the force of his reasoning; but for all that, their fingers\r\nitched when they came within shot-range of a sable or some valuable fox.\r\nTheir Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s orders were, however, not to be disobeyed.\r\n\r\nPolar bears and birds were, therefore, all that the hunters had to\r\npractise upon in this second stage of their journey. The former,\r\nhowever, not yet rendered bold by hunger, soon scampered off, and no\r\nserious struggle with them ensued.\r\n\r\nThe poor birds suffered for the enforced immunity of the quadrupeds.\r\nWhite-headed eagles, huge birds with a harsh screeching cry; fishing\r\nhawks, which build their nests in dead trees and migrate to the Arctic\r\nregions in the summer; snow buntings with pure white plumage, wild\r\ngeese, which afford the best food of all the Anseres tribe; ducks with\r\nred heads and black breasts; ash-coloured crows, a kind of mocking jay\r\nof extreme ugliness; eider ducks; scoters or black divers, &c. &c.,\r\nwhose mingled cries awake the echoes of the Arctic regions, fell victims\r\nby hundreds to the unerring aim of Marbre and Sabine. These birds haunt\r\nthe high latitudes by millions, and it would be impossible to form an\r\naccurate estimate of their number on the shores of the Arctic Ocean.\r\nTheir flesh formed a very pleasant addition to the daily rations of\r\nbiscuit and corned beef, and we can understand that the hunters laid up\r\na good stock of them in the fifteen days during which they were debarred\r\nfrom attacking more valuable game.\r\n\r\nThere would then be no lack of animal food; the magazines of the Company\r\nwould be well stocked with game, and its offices filled with furs\r\nand traders; but something more was wanted to insure success to the\r\nundertaking. Would it be possible to obtain a sufficient supply of\r\nfuel to contend with the rigour of an Arctic winter at so elevated a\r\nlatitude?\r\n\r\nMost fortunately the coast, was well wooded; the hills which sloped down\r\ntowards the sea were crowned with green trees, amongst which the pine\r\npredominated. Some of the woods might even be called forests, and would\r\nconstitute an admirable reserve of timber for the fort. Here and there\r\nHobson noticed isolated groups of willows, poplars, dwarf birch-trees,\r\nand numerous thickets of arbutus. At this time of the warm season\r\nall these trees were covered with verdure, and were an unexpected and\r\nrefreshing sight to eyes so long accustomed to the rugged, barren polar\r\nlandscape. The ground at the foot of the hills was carpeted with a short\r\nherbage devoured with avidity by the reindeer, and forming their only\r\nsustenance in winter. On the whole, then, the Lieutenant had reason to\r\ncongratulate himself on having chosen the north-west of the American\r\ncontinent for the foundation of a new settlement.\r\n\r\nWe have said that these territories, so rich in animals, were apparently\r\ndeserted by men. The travellers saw neither Esquimaux, who prefer the\r\ndistricts round Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay, nor Indians, who seldom venture so far\r\nbeyond the Arctic Circle. And indeed in these remote latitudes hunters\r\nmay be overtaken by storms, or be suddenly surprised by winter, and cut\r\noff from all communication with their fellow-creatures. We can easily\r\nimagine that Lieutenant Hobson was by no means sorry not to meet any\r\nrival explorers. What he wanted was an unoccupied country, a deserted\r\nland, suitable as a refuge for the fur-bearing animals; and in this\r\nmatter he had the full sympathy of Mrs Barnett, who, as the guest of the\r\nCompany, naturally took a great interest in the success of its schemes.\r\n\r\nFancy, then, the disappointment of the Lieutenant, when on the morning\r\nof the 20th June he came to an encampment but recently abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt was situated at the end of a narrow creek called Darnley Bay, of\r\nwhich Cape Parry is the westernmost point. There at the foot of a little\r\nhill were the stakes which had served to mark the limits of the camp,\r\nand heaps of cinders, the extinct embers of the fires.\r\n\r\nThe whole party met at this encampment, and all understood how great a\r\ndisappointment it involved for Lieutenant Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather have met a whole\r\nfamily of polar bears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I daresay the men who encamped here are already far off,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cvery likely they have returned to their usual hunting\r\ngrounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is as it may be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant. \xe2\x80\x9cIf these be the\r\ntraces of Esquimaux, they are more likely to have gone on than to have\r\nturned back; and if they be those of Indians, they are probably, like\r\nourselves, seeking a new hunting district; and in either case it will be\r\nvery unfortunate for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot we find out to what race the\r\ntravellers do belong? Can\xe2\x80\x99t we ascertain if they be Esquimaux or\r\nIndians from the south? I should think tribes of such a different\r\norigin, and of such dissimilar customs, would not encamp in the same\r\nmanner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett was right; they might possibly solve the mystery after a\r\nthorough examination of the ground.\r\n\r\nJaspar Hobson and others set to work, carefully examining every trace,\r\nevery object left behind, every mark on the ground; but in vain, there\r\nwas nothing to guide them to a decided opinion. The bones of some\r\nanimals scattered about told them nothing, and the Lieutenant, much\r\nannoyed, was about to abandon the useless search, when he heard an\r\nexclamation from Mrs Joliffe, who had wandered a little way to the left.\r\n\r\nAll hurried towards the young Canadian, who remained fixed to the spot,\r\nlooking attentively at the ground before her.\r\n\r\nAs her companions came up she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are looking for traces, Lieutenant; well, here are some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs Joliffe pointed to a good many footprints clearly visible in the\r\nfirm clay.\r\n\r\nThese might reveal something; for the feet of the Indians and Esquimaux,\r\nas well as their boots, are totally different from each other.\r\n\r\nBut what chiefly struck Lieutenant Hobson was the strange arrangement\r\nof these impressions. They were evidently made by a human foot, a shod\r\nfoot; but, strange to say, the ball alone appeared to have touched the\r\nground! The marks were very numerous, close together, often crossing one\r\nanother, but confined to a very small circle.\r\n\r\nJaspar Hobson called the attention of the rest of the party to this\r\nsingular circumstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese were not made by a person walking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor by a person jumping,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cfor there is no\r\nmark of a heel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Joliffe; \xe2\x80\x9cthese footprints were left by a\r\ndancer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was right, as further examination proved. They were the marks left\r\nby a dancer, and a dancer engaged in some light and graceful exercise,\r\nfor they were neither clumsy nor deep.\r\n\r\nBut who could the light-hearted individual be who had been impelled to\r\ndance in this sprightly fashion some degrees above the Arctic Circle?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was certainly not an Esquimaux,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor an Indian,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Corporal Joliffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was a Frenchman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Long quietly.\r\n\r\nAnd all agreed that none but a Frenchman could have been capable of\r\ndancing on such a spot.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. THE MIDNIGHT SUN. Sergeant Long\xe2\x80\x99s assertion must appear\r\nto have been founded on insufficient evidence. That there had been\r\ndancing no one could deny, but that the dancer was a Frenchman, however\r\nprobable, could not be considered proved.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Lieutenant shared the opinion of his subordinate, which did\r\nnot appear too positive to any of the party, who all agreed in feeling\r\nsure that some travellers, with at least one compatriot of Vestris\r\namongst them, had recently encamped on this spot.\r\n\r\nOf course Lieutenant Hobson was by no means pleased at this he was\r\nafraid of having been preceded by rivals in the north-western districts\r\nof English America; and secret as the Company had kept its scheme, it\r\nhad doubtless been divulged in the commercial centres of Canada and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant resumed his interrupted march; but he was full of care\r\nand anxiety, although he would not now have dreamed of retracing his\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrenchmen are then sometimes met with in these high latitudes?\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nMrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s natural question after this incident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cor if not exactly\r\nFrenchmen, the descendants of the masters of Canada when it belonged to\r\nFrance, which comes to much the same thing. These men are in fact our\r\nmost formidable rivals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat after the absorption\r\nby the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company of the old North-West Company, that it had\r\nno longer any rivals on the American continent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough there is no longer any important association for trading in\r\nfurs except our own, there are a good many perfectly independent private\r\ncompanies, mostly American, which have retained French agents or their\r\ndescendants in their employ.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre these agents then held in such high esteem?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam, and with good reason. During the ninety-four years of\r\nFrench supremacy in Canada, French agents always proved themselves\r\nsuperior to ours. We must be just even to our rivals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially to our rivals,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, especially. . . At that time French hunters, starting from\r\nMontreal, their headquarters, pressed on to the north with greater\r\nhardihood than any others. They lived for years with the Indian\r\ntribes, sometimes intermarrying with them. The natives called them the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Canadian travellers,\xe2\x80\x99 and were on the most intimate terms with\r\nthem. They were bold, clever fellows, expert at navigating streams,\r\nlight-hearted and merry, adapting themselves to circumstances with the\r\neasy flexibility of their race, and always ready to sing or dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you suppose that hunting is the only object of the party whose\r\ntraces we have just discovered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think any other hypotheses at all likely,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nHobson. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are sure to be seeking new hunting grounds. But as\r\nwe cannot possibly stop them, we must make haste to begin our own\r\noperations, and compete boldly with all rivals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson was now prepared for the competition he could not\r\nprevent, and he urged on the march of his party as much as possible,\r\nhoping that his rivals might not follow him beyond the seventieth\r\nparallel.\r\n\r\nThe expedition now descended towards the south for some twenty miles, in\r\norder the more easily to pass round Franklin Bay. The country was still\r\ncovered with verdure, and the quadrupeds and birds already enumerated\r\nwere as plentiful as ever; so that they could reasonably hope that\r\nthe whole of the north-western coasts of the American continent were\r\npopulated in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe ocean which bathed these shores stretched away as far as the eye\r\ncould reach Recent atlases give no land beyond the north American\r\ncoast-line, and it is only the icebergs which impede the free navigation\r\nof the open sea from Behring Strait to the Pole itself.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th July the travellers skirted round another deep bay called\r\nWashburn Bay, and reached the furthest point of a little lake, until\r\nthen imperfectly known, covering but a small extent of territory,\r\nscarcely two square miles-in fact it was rather a lagoon, or large pond\r\nof sweet water, than a lake.\r\n\r\nThe sledges went on easily and rapidly, and the appearance of the\r\ncountry was most encouraging to the explorers. It seemed that the\r\nextremity of Cape Bathurst would be a most favourable site for the new\r\nfort, as with this lagoon behind them, and the sea open for four or five\r\nmonths in the warm season, and giving access to the great highway of\r\nBehring Strait, before them, it would be easy for the exiles to lay in\r\nfresh provisions and to export their commodities.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th June, about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, the party at\r\nlast halted at the extremity of Cape Bathurst. It remained to ascertain\r\nthe exact position of this cape, which the maps place above the\r\nseventieth parallel. It was, however, impossible to rely upon the marine\r\nsurveys of the coast, as they had never yet been made with exactitude.\r\nJaspar Hobson decided to wait and ascertain the latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat prevents us from settling here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Corporal Joliffe.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will own, Lieutenant, that it is a very inviting spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will seem more inviting still if you get double pay here, my\r\nworthy Corporal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joliffe; \xe2\x80\x9cand the orders of the Company must be\r\nobeyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen wait patiently till to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cand if we\r\nfind that Cape Bathurst is really beyond 70\xc2\xb0 north latitude, we will\r\npitch our tent here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe site was indeed admirably suited for the foundation of a new\r\nsettlement. The wooded heights surrounding the lagoon would supply\r\nplenty of pine, birch, and other woods for the construction of the\r\nfort, and for stocking, it with\xe2\x80\x99 fuel. The Lieutenant and some of his\r\ncompanions went to the very edge of the cape, and found that towards the\r\nwest the coast-line formed a lengthened curve, beyond which icebergs\r\nof a considerable height shut out the view. The water of the lagoon,\r\ninstead of being brackish as they expected from its close vicinity to\r\nthe sea, was perfectly sweet; but had it not been so, drinkable water\r\nwould not have failed the little colony, as a fresh and limpid stream\r\nran a few yards to the south-east of Cape Bathurst, and emptied itself\r\ninto the Arctic Ocean through a narrow inlet, which, protected by a\r\nsingular accumulation of sand and earth instead of by rocks, would have\r\nafforded a refuge to several vessels from the winds of the offing, and\r\nmight be turned to account for the anchorage of the ships which it\r\nwas hoped would come to the new settlement from Behring Strait. Out of\r\ncompliment to the lady of the party, and much to her delight, Lieutenant\r\nHobson named the stream Paulina river, and the little harbour Port\r\nBarnett.\r\n\r\nBy building the fort a little behind the actual cape, the principal\r\nhouse and the magazines would be quite sheltered from the coldest\r\nwinds. The elevation of the cape would help to protect them from the\r\nsnow-drifts, which sometimes completely bury large buildings beneath\r\ntheir heavy avalanches in a few hours. There was plenty of room between\r\nthe foot of the promontory and the bank of the lagoon for all the\r\nconstructions necessary to a fort. It could even be surrounded by\r\npalisades, which would break the shock of the icebergs; and the cape\r\nitself might be surrounded with a fortified redoubt, if the vicinity of\r\nrivals should render such a purely defensive erection necessary; and the\r\nLieutenant, although with no idea of commencing anything of the kind\r\nas yet, naturally rejoiced at having met with an easily defensible\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe weather remained fine, and it was quite warm enough. There was not a\r\ncloud upon the sky; but, of course, the clear blue air of temperate\r\nand torrid zones could not be expected here, and the atmosphere was\r\ngenerally charged with a light mist. What would Cape Bathurst be like in\r\nthe long winter night of four months when the ice-mountains became fixed\r\nand rigid, and the hoarse north wind swept down upon the icebergs in\r\nall its fury? None of the party gave a thought to that time now; for\r\nthe weather was beautiful, the verdant landscape smiled, and the waves\r\nsparkled in the sunbeams, whilst the temperature remained warm and\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nA provisional camp, the sledges forming its only material, was arranged\r\nfor the night on the banks of the lagoon; and towards evening Mrs\r\nBarnett, the Lieutenant, Sergeant Long, and even Thomas Black, explored\r\nthe surrounding district in order to ascertain its resources. It\r\nappeared to be in every respect suitable; and Hobson was eager for the\r\nnext day, that he might determine the exact situations, and find out if\r\nit fulfilled the conditions imposed by the Company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said the astronomer when the examination was\r\nover, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is really a charming spot, such as I should not have\r\nimagined could have existed beyond the Arctic Circle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mr Black!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cthe finest countries in the world\r\nare to be found here, and I am impatient to ascertain our latitude and\r\nlongitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially the latitude,\xe2\x80\x9d said the astronomer, whose eclipse was\r\nnever out of his thoughts; \xe2\x80\x9cand I expect your brave companions are as\r\neager as yourself. Double pay beyond the seventieth parallel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr Black,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you not yourself take\r\nan interest a purely scientific interest, in getting beyond that\r\nparallel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, madam, of course I am anxious to get beyond it, but not\r\nso terribly eager. According to our calculations, however, made with\r\nabsolute accuracy, the solar eclipse which I am ordered to watch will\r\nonly be total to an observer placed beyond the seventieth degree, and\r\non this account I share the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s impatience to determine the\r\nposition of Cape Bathurst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I understand, Mr Black,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this solar\r\neclipse will not take place until the 18th July 1860?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam, on the 18th July 1860.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is now only the 15th June 1859! So that the phenomenon will\r\nnot be visible for more than a year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite aware of it, Mrs Barnett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the astronomer;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut if I had not started till next year I should have run a risk of\r\nbeing too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would, Mr Black,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cand you did well to start a\r\nyear beforehand. You are now quite sure not to miss your eclipse. I\r\nown that our journey from Fort Reliance has been accomplished under\r\nexceptionally favourable circumstances. We have had little fatigue and\r\nfew delays. To tell you the truth, I did not expect to get to this part\r\nof the coast until the middle of August; and if the eclipse had been\r\nexpected this year, instead of next; you really might have been too\r\nlate. Moreover, we do not yet know if we are beyond the seventieth\r\nparallel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not in the least regret the journey I have taken in your\r\ncompany, Lieutenant, and I shall patiently wait until next year for my\r\neclipse. The fair Ph\xc5\x93be, I fancy, is a sufficiently grand lady to be\r\nwaited for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 6th, a little after noon, Hobson and the astronomer\r\nmade their preparations for taking the exact bearings of Cape Bathurst.\r\nThe sun shone clearly enough for them to take the outlines exactly. At\r\nthis season of the year, too, it had reached its maximum height above\r\nthe horizon; and consequently its culmination, on its transit across the\r\nmeridian, would facilitate the work of the two observers.\r\n\r\nAlready the night before, and the same morning, by raking different\r\naltitudes, and by means of a calculation of right ascensions, the\r\nLieutenant and the astronomer had ascertained the longitude with great\r\naccuracy. But it was about the latitude that Hobson was most anxious;\r\nfor what would the meridian of Cape Bathurst matter to him should it not\r\nbe situated beyond the seventieth parallel?\r\n\r\nNoon approached. The men of the expedition gathered round the observers\r\nwith their sextants ready in their hands. The brave fellows awaited\r\nthe result of the observation with an impatience which will be readily\r\nunderstood. It was now to be decided whether they had come to the end\r\nof their journey, or whether they must search still further for a spot\r\nfulfilling the conditions imposed by the Company.\r\n\r\nProbably no good result would have followed upon further explorations,\r\nAccording to the maps of North America-imperfect, it is true-the western\r\ncoast beyond Cape Bathurst sloped down below the seventieth parallel,\r\nnot again rising above it until it entered Russian America, where\r\nthe English had as yet no right to settle; so that Hobson had shown\r\nconsiderable judgment in directing his course to Cape Bathurst after\r\na thorough examination of the maps of these northern regions. This\r\npromontory is, in fact, the only one which juts out beyond the\r\nseventieth parallel along the whole of the North American continent,\r\nproperly so called-that is to say, in English America. It remained to be\r\nproved that it really occupied the position assigned to it in maps.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the sun was approaching the culminating-point of its\r\ncourse, and the two observers pointed the telescopes of their sextants\r\nupon it. By means of inclined mirrors attached to the instruments, the\r\nsun ought apparently to go back to the horizon itself; and the moment\r\nwhen it seemed to touch it with the lower side of its disc would be\r\nprecisely that at which it would occupy the highest point of the\r\ndiurnal arc, and consequently the exact moment when it would pass\r\nthe meridian-in other words, it would be noon at the place where the\r\nobservation was taken.\r\n\r\nAll watched in anxious silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoon!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jaspar Hobson and the astronomer at once.\r\n\r\nThe telescopes were immediately lowered. The Lieutenant and Thomas\r\nBlack read on the graduated limbs the value of the angles they had just\r\nobtained, and at once proceeded to note down their observations.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards, Lieutenant Hobson rose and said, addressing\r\nhis companions\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends, from this date, July 6th, I promise you double pay in the\r\nname of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah! hurrah for the Company!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the worthy\r\ncompanions of the Lieutenant with one voice.\r\n\r\nCape Bathurst and its immediate neighbourhood were in very truth above\r\nthe seventieth degree of north latitude.\r\n\r\nWe give the result of these simultaneous observations, which agreed to a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nLongitude, 127\xc2\xb0 36\xe2\x80\x99 12\xe2\x80\x9d west of the meridian of Greenwich.\r\n\r\nLatitude, 70\xc2\xb0 44\xe2\x80\x99 37\xe2\x80\x9d north.\r\n\r\nAnd that very evening these hardy pioneers, encamped so far from the\r\ninhabited world, watched the mighty luminary of day touch the edges of\r\nthe western horizon without dipping beneath it.\r\n\r\nFor the first time they saw the shining of the midnight sun.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. FORT HOPE. The site of the new fort was now finally\r\ndetermined on. It would be impossible to find a better situation than on\r\nthe level ground behind Cape Bathurst, on the eastern bank of the lagoon\r\nHobson determined to commence the construction of the principal house at\r\nonce. Meanwhile all must accommodate themselves as best they could; and\r\nthe sledges were ingeniously utilised to form a provisional encampment.\r\n\r\nHis men being very skilful, the Lieutenant hoped to have the principal\r\nhouse ready in a month. It was to be large enough to accommodate for a\r\ntime the nineteen persons of the party. Later, and before the excessive\r\ncold set in, if there should be time, the barracks for the soldiers and\r\nthe magazines for the furs and skins were to be built. There was not\r\nmuch chance of getting it all done before the end of September; and\r\nafter that date, the winter, with its first bitter frosts and long\r\nnights, would arrest all further progress.\r\n\r\nOf the ten soldiers chosen by Captain Craventy, two-Marbre and\r\nSabine-were skilful hunters; the other eight handled the hatchet with as\r\nmuch address as the musket. Like sailors, they could turn their hands\r\nto anything, and were now to be treated more like workmen than soldiers,\r\nfor they were to build a fort which there was as yet no enemy to attack.\r\nPetersen, Belcher, Rae, Garry, Pond, Hope, and Kellet formed a body of\r\nclever, zealous carpenters, under the able superintendence of Mac-Nab,\r\na Scotchman from Stirling, who had had considerable experience in the\r\nbuilding both of houses and boats. The men were well provided with\r\ntools-hatchets, centre-bits, adzes, planes, hand-saws, mallets, hammers,\r\nchisels, &c. &c. Rae was most skilful at blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s work, and with\r\nthe aid of a little portable forge he was able to make all the pins,\r\ntenons, bolts, nails, screws, nuts, &e., required in carpentry. They had\r\nno mason in the party; but none was wanted, as all the buildings of the\r\nfactories in the north are of wood. Fortunately there were plenty of\r\ntrees about Cape Bathurst, although as Hobson had already remarked\r\nto Mrs Barnett, there was not a rock, a stone, not even a flint or a\r\npebble, to be seen. The shore was strewn with innumerable quantities of\r\nbivalve shells broken by the surf, and with seaweed or zoophytes, mostly\r\nsea-urchins and asteriad\xc3\xa6; but the soil consisted entirely of earth and\r\nsand, without a morsel of silica or broken granite; and the cape itself\r\nwas but an accumulation of soft earth, the particles of which were\r\nscarcely held together by the vegetation with which it was clothed.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the same day, July 6th Hobson and Mac-Nab the\r\ncarpenter went to choose the site of the principal house on the plateau\r\nat the foot of Cape Bathurst. From this point the view embraced the\r\nlagoon and the western districts to a distance of ten or twelve miles.\r\nOn the right, about four miles off, towered icebergs of a considerable\r\nheight. partly draped in mist; whilst on the left stretched apparently\r\nboundless plains, vast steppes which it would be impossible to\r\ndistinguish from the frozen surface of the lagoon or from the sea itself\r\nin the winter.\r\n\r\nThe spot chosen, Hobson and Mac-Nab set out the outer walls of the house\r\nwith the line. This outline formed a rectangle measuring sixty feet on\r\nthe larger side, and thirty on the smaller. The fa\xc3\xa7ade of the house\r\nwould therefore have a length of sixty feet it was to have a door and\r\nthree windows on the side of the promontory, where the inner court was\r\nto be situated, and four windows on the side of the lagoon. The door was\r\nto open at the left corner, instead of in the middle, of the back of\r\nthe house, for the sake of warmth. This arrangement would impede the\r\nentrance of the outer air to the further rooms, and add considerably to\r\nthe comfort of the inmates of the fort.\r\n\r\nAccording to the simple plan agreed upon by the Lieutenant and his\r\nmaster-carpenter, there were to be four compartments in the house: the\r\nfirst to be an antechamber with a double door to keep out the wind;\r\nthe second to serve as a kitchen, that the cooking which would generate\r\ndamp, might be all done quite away from the living-rooms; the third, a\r\nlarge hall, where the daily meals were to be served in common; and the\r\nfourth, to be divided into several cabins, like the state-rooms on board\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were to occupy the dining-hall provisionally, and a kind of\r\ncamp-bed was arranged for them at the end of the room. The Lieutenant,\r\nMrs Barnett, Thomas Black, Madge, Mrs Joliffe, Mrs Mac-Nab, and Mrs\r\nRae were to lodge in the cabins of the fourth compartment. They would\r\ncertainly be packed pretty closely; but it was only a temporary state\r\nof things, and when the barracks were constructed, the principal house\r\nwould be reserved to the officer in command, his sergeant, Thomas Black,\r\nMrs Barnett, and her faithful Madge, who never left her. Then the fourth\r\ncompartment might perhaps be divided into three cabins, instead of four;\r\nfor to avoid corners as much as possible is a rule which should never be\r\nforgotten by those who winter in high latitudes Nooks and corners\r\nare, in fact, so many receptacles of ice. The partitions impede the\r\nventilation; and the moisture, generated in the air, freezes readily,\r\nand makes the atmosphere of the rooms unhealthy causing grave maladies\r\nto those who sleep in them.\r\n\r\nOn this account many navigators who have to winter in the midst of ice\r\nhave one large room in the centre of their vessel, which is shared by\r\nofficers and sailors in common. For obvious reasons, however, Hobson\r\ncould not adopt this plan.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding description we shall have seen that the future house\r\nwas to consist merely of a ground-floor. The roof was to be high, and\r\nits sides to slope considerably, so that water could easily run off\r\nthem. The snow would, however, settle upon them; and when once they were\r\ncovered with it, the house would be, so to speak, hermetically closed,\r\nand the inside temperature would be kept at the same mean height. Snow\r\nis, in fact, a very bad conductor of beat: it prevents it from entering,\r\nit is true; but, what is more important in an Arctic winter, it also\r\nkeeps it from getting out.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter was to build two chimneys-one above the kitchen, the other\r\nin connection with the stove of the large dining-room, which was to heat\r\nit and the compartment containing the cabins. The architectural\r\neffect of the whole would certainly be poor; but the house would be as\r\ncomfortable as possible, and what more could any one desire?\r\n\r\nCertainly an artist who had once seen it would not soon forget this\r\nwinter residence, set down in the gloomy Arctic twilight in the midst\r\nof snow-drifts, half hidden by icicles, draped in white from roof to\r\nfoundation, its walls encrusted with snow, and the smoke from its fires\r\nassuming strangely-contorted forms in the wind.\r\n\r\nBut now to tell of the actual construction of this house, as yet\r\nexisting only in imagination. This, of course, was the business of\r\nMac-Nab and his men; and while the carpenters were at work, the foraging\r\nparty to whom the commissariat was entrusted would not be idle. There\r\nwas plenty for every one to do.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to choose suitable timber, and a species of Scotch\r\nfir was decided on, which grew conveniently upon the neighbouring hills,\r\nand seemed altogether well adapted to the multifarious uses to which it\r\nwould be put. For in the rough and ready style of habitation which they\r\nwere planning, there could be no variety of material; and every part\r\nof the house-outside and inside walls, flooring, ceiling, partitions,\r\nrafters, ridges, framework, and tiling-would have to be contrived\r\nof planks, beams, and timbers. As may readily be supposed, finished\r\nworkmanship was not necessary for such a description of building, and\r\nMac-Nab was able to proceed very rapidly without endangering the\r\nsafety of the building. About a hundred of these firs were chosen and\r\nfelled-they were neither barked nor squared-and formed so many timbers,\r\naveraging some twenty feet in length. The axe and the chisel did not\r\ntouch them except at the ends, in order to form the tenons and mortises\r\nby which they were to be secured to one another. Very few days sufficed\r\nto complete this part of the work, and the timbers were brought down by\r\nthe dogs to the site fixed on for the principal building. To start with,\r\nthe site had been carefully levelled. The soil, a mixture of fine\r\nearth and sand, had been beaten and consolidated with heavy blows. The\r\nbrushwood with which it was originally covered was burnt, and the thick\r\nlayer of ashes thus produced would prevent the damp from penetrating the\r\nfloors. A clean and dry foundation having been thus secured on which\r\nto lay the first joists, upright posts were fixed at each corner of the\r\nsite, and at the extremities of the inside walls, to form the skeleton\r\nof the building. The posts were sunk to a depth of some feet in the\r\nground, after their ends had been hardened in the fire; and were\r\nslightly hollowed at each side to receive the crossbeams of the outer\r\nwall, between which the openings for the doors and windows had been\r\narranged for. These posts were held together at the top by horizontal\r\nbeams well let into the mortises, and consolidating the whole building.\r\nOn these horizontal beams, which represented the architraves of the two\r\nfronts, rested the high trusses of the roof, which overhung the walls\r\nlike the eaves of a chalet. Above this squared architrave were laid the\r\njoists of the ceiling, and those of the floor upon the layer of ashes.\r\n\r\nThe timbers, both in the inside and outside walls, were only laid side\r\nby side. To insure their being properly joined, Rae the blacksmith\r\ndrove strong iron bolts through them at intervals; and when even this\r\ncontrivance proved insufficient to close the interstices as hermetically\r\nas was necessary, Mac-Nab had recourse to calking, a process which\r\nseamen find invaluable in rendering vessels water-tight; only as a\r\nsubstitute for tow he used a sort of dry moss, with which the eastern\r\nside of the cape was covered, driving it into the crevices with\r\ncalking-irons and a hammer, filling up each hollow with layers of hot\r\ntar, obtained without difficulty from the pine-trees, and thus making\r\nthe walls and boarding impervious to the rain and damp of the winter\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe door and windows in the two fronts were roughly but strongly built,\r\nand the small panes of the latter glazed with isinglass, which, though\r\nrough, yellow, and almost opaque, was yet the best substitute for glass\r\nwhich the resources of the country afforded; and its imperfections\r\nreally mattered little, as the windows were sure to be always open in\r\nfine weather; while during, the long night of the Arctic winter they\r\nwould be useless, and have to be kept closed and defended by heavy\r\nshutters with strong bolts against the violence of the gales. Meanwhile\r\nthe house was being quickly fitted up inside. By means of a double door\r\nbetween the outer and inner halls a too sudden change of temperature\r\nwas avoided, and the wind was prevented from blowing with unbroken force\r\ninto the rooms. The air-pumps, brought from Fort Reliance, were so fixed\r\nas to let in fresh air whenever excessive cold prevented the opening of\r\ndoors or windows -one being made to eject the impure air from within,\r\nthe other to renew the supply; for the Lieutenant had given his whole\r\nmind to this important matter.\r\n\r\nThe principal cooking utensil was a large iron furnace, which had been\r\nbrought piecemeal from Fort Reliance, and which the carpenter put up\r\nwithout any difficulty. The chimneys for the kitchen and ball, however,\r\nseemed likely to tax the ingenuity of the workmen to the utmost, as\r\nno material within their reach was strong enough for the purpose, and\r\nstone, as we have said before, was nowhere to be found in the country\r\naround Cape Bathurst.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty appeared insurmountable, when the invincible Lieutenant\r\nsuggested that they should utilise the shells with which the shore was\r\nstrewed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake chimneys of shells!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mac-Nab,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must collect the shells,\r\ngrind them, burn them, and make them into lime, then mould the lime into\r\nbricks, and use them in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try the shells, by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the carpenter; and\r\nso the idea was put in practice at once, and many tons collected of\r\ncalcareous shells identical with those found in the lowest stratum of\r\nthe Tertiary formations.\r\n\r\nA furnace was constructed for the decomposition of the carbonate which\r\nis so large an ingredient of these shells, and thus the lime required\r\nwas obtained in the space of a few hours. It would perhaps be too much\r\nto say that the substance thus made was as entirely satisfactory as\r\nif it had gone through all the usual processes; but it answered its\r\npurpose, and strong conical chimneys soon adorned the roof, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of Mrs Paulina Barnett, who congratulated the originator of\r\nthe scheme warmly on its success, only adding laughingly, that she hoped\r\nthe chimneys would not smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they will smoke, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson coolly; \xe2\x80\x9call\r\nchimneys do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this was finished within a month, and on the 6th of August they were\r\nto take possession of the new house.\r\n\r\nWhile Mac-Nab and his men were working so hard, the foraging party,\r\nwith the Lieutenant at its head, had been exploring the environs of Cape\r\nBathurst, and satisfied themselves that there would be no difficulty in\r\nsupplying the Company\xe2\x80\x99s demands for fur and feathers, so soon as they\r\ncould set about hunting in earnest. In the meantime they prepared the\r\nway for future sport, contenting themselves for the present with the\r\ncapture of a few couples of reindeer, which they intended to domesticate\r\nfor the sake of their milk and their young. They were kept in a paddock\r\nabout fifty yards from the house, and entrusted to the care of Mac-Nabs\r\nwife, an Indian woman, well qualified to take charge of them.\r\n\r\nThe care of the household fell to Mrs Paulina Barnett, and this good\r\nwoman, with Madge\xe2\x80\x99s help, was invaluable in providing for all the\r\nsmall wants, which would inevitably have escaped the notice of the men.\r\n\r\nAfter scouring the country within a radius of several miles, the\r\nLieutenant notified, as the result of his observations, that the\r\nterritory on which they had established themselves, and to which he gave\r\nthe name of Victoria Land, was a large peninsula about one hundred and\r\nfifty square miles in extent, with very clearly-defined boundaries,\r\nconnected with the American continent by an isthmus, extending from\r\nthe lower end of Washburn Bay on the east, as fair as the corresponding\r\nslope on the opposite coast. The Lieutenant next proceeded to ascertain\r\nwhat were the resources of the lake and river, and found great reason to\r\nbe satisfied with the result of his examination. The shallow waters of\r\nthe lake teemed with trout, pike, and other available fresh-water fish;\r\nand the little river was a favourite resort of salmon and shoals of\r\nwhite bait and smelts. The supply of sea-fish was not so good; and\r\nthough many a grampus and whale passed by in the offing, the latter\r\nprobably flying from the harpoons of the Behring Strait fishermen there\r\nwere no means of capturing them unless one by chance happened to get\r\nstranded on the coast; nor would Hobson allow any of the seals\r\nwhich abounded on the western shore to be taken until a satisfactory\r\nconclusion should be arrived at as to how to use them to the best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe colonists now considered themselves fairly installed stalled in\r\ntheir new abode, and after due deliberation unanimously agreed to bestow\r\nupon the settlement the name of Fort Good Hope.\r\n\r\nAlas! the auspicious title was never to be inscribed upon a map. The\r\nundertaking, begun so bravely and with such prospects of success, was\r\ndestined never to be carried out, and another disaster would have to be\r\nadded to the long list of failures in Arctic enterprise.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. SOME EXCURSIONS. It did not take long to furnish the new\r\nabode. A camp-bed was set up in the hall, and the carpenter Mac-Nab\r\nconstructed a most substantial table, around which were ranged fixed\r\nbenches. A few movable seats and two enormous presses completed the\r\nfurniture of this apartment. The inner room, which was also ready, was\r\ndivided by solid partitions into six dormitories, the two end ones\r\nalone being lighted by windows looking to the front and back. The only\r\nfurniture was a bed and a table. Mrs Paulina Barnett and Madge were\r\ninstalled in one which looked immediately out upon the lake. Hobson\r\noffered the other with the window in it to Thomas Black, and the\r\nastronomer took immediate possession of it. The Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s own room\r\nwas a dark cell adjoining the hall, with no window but a bull\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\npierced through the partition. Mrs Joliffe, Mrs Mac-Nab, and Mrs Rae,\r\nwith their husbands, occupied the other dormitories. These good people\r\nagreed so well together that it would have been a pity to separate them.\r\nMoreover, an addition was expected shortly to the little colony; and\r\nMac-Nab had already gone so far as to secure the services of Mrs Barnett\r\nas god-mother, an honour which gave the good woman much satisfaction.\r\nThe sledges had been entirely unloaded, and the bedding carried into\r\nthe different rooms. All utensils, stores, and provisions which were\r\nnot required for immediate use were stowed away in a garret, to which a\r\nladder gave access. The winter clothing-such as boots, overcoats, furs,\r\nand skins-were also taken there, and protected from the damp in large\r\nchests. As soon as these arrangements were completed, the Lieutenant\r\nbegan to provide for the heating of the house.\r\n\r\nKnowing that the most energetic measures were necessary to combat the\r\nseverity of the Arctic winter, and that during the weeks of intensest\r\ncold there would be no possibility of leaving the house to forage for\r\nsupplies, he ordered a quantity of fuel to be brought from the wooded\r\nhills in the neighbourhood, and took care to obtain a plentiful store of\r\noil from the seals which abounded on the shore.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to his orders, and under his directions, the house was\r\nprovided with a condensing apparatus which would receive the internal\r\nmoisture, and was so constructed that the ice which would form in it\r\ncould easily be removed.\r\n\r\nThis question of heating was a very serious one to the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a native of the Polar regions, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he often said to Mrs\r\nBarnett; \xe2\x80\x9cI have some experience in these matters, and I have read\r\nover and over again books written by those who have wintered in these\r\nlatitudes. It is impossible to take too many precautions in preparing to\r\npass a winter in the Arctic regions, and nothing must be left to chance\r\nwhere a single neglect may prove fatal to the enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, Mr Hobson,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cand you have\r\nevidently made up your mind to conquer the cold; but there is the food\r\nto be thought of too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed; I have been thinking of that, and mean to make all\r\npossible use of the produce of the country so as to economise our\r\nstores. As soon as we can, we will make some foraging expeditions. We\r\nneed not think about the furs at present, for there will be plenty of\r\ntime during the winter to stock the Company\xe2\x80\x99s dep\xc3\xb4ts. Besides, the\r\nfurred animals have not got their winter clothing on yet, and the skins\r\nwould lose fifty per cent. of their value if taken now. Let us content\r\nourselves for the present with provisioning Fort Hope. Reindeer, elk,\r\n- and any wapitis that may have ventured so far north are the only game\r\nworth our notice just now; it will be no small undertaking to provide\r\nfood for twenty people and sixty dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant loved order, and determined to do everything in the most\r\nmethodical manner, feeling confident that if his companions would help\r\nhim to the utmost of their power, nothing need be wanting to the success\r\nof the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe weather at this season was almost always fine, and might be expected\r\nto continue so for five weeks longer, when the snow would begin to fall.\r\nIt was very important that the carpenters-should make all possible use\r\nof the interval; and as soon as the principal house was finished, Hobson\r\nset them to work to build an enormous kennel or shed in which to keep\r\nthe teams of dogs. This doghouse was built at the very foot of the\r\npromontory, against the hill, and about forty yards to the right of\r\nthe house. Barracks for the accommodation of the men were to be built\r\nopposite this kennel on the left, while the store and powder magazines\r\nwere to occupy the front of the enclosure.\r\n\r\nHobson determined with almost excessive prudence to have the Factory\r\nenclosed before the winter set in. A strong fence of pointed stakes,\r\nplanted firmly in the ground, was set up as a protection against\r\nthe inroads of wild animals or the hostilities of the natives. The\r\nLieutenant had not forgotten an outrage which had been committed along\r\nthe coast at no great distance from Fort Hope, and he well knew how\r\nessential it was to be safe from a coup de main. The factory was\r\ntherefore entirely encircled, and at each extremity of the lagoon\r\nMac-Nab undertook to erect a wooden sentry-box commanding the\r\ncoast-line, from which a watch could be kept without any danger. The\r\nmen worked indefatigably, and it seemed likely that everything would be\r\nfinished before the cold season set in.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime hunting parties were organised. The capture of seals\r\nbeing put off for a more convenient season, the sportsmen prepared\r\nto supply the fort with game, which might be dried and preserved for\r\nconsumption during the bad season.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Marbre and Sabine, sometimes accompanied by the Lieutenant\r\nand Sergeant Long, whose experience was invaluable, scoured the country\r\ndaily for miles round; and it was no uncommon sight to see Mrs Paulina\r\nBarnett join them and step briskly along shouldering her gun bravely,\r\nand never allowing herself to be outstripped by her companions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of August these expeditions were continued with\r\ngreat success, and the store of provisions increased rapidly. Marbre\r\nand Sabine were skilled in all the artifices which sportsmen employ in\r\nstalking their prey-particularly the reindeer, which are exceedingly\r\nwary. How patiently they would face the wind lest the creature\xe2\x80\x99s keen\r\nsense of smell should warn it of their approach! and how cunningly they\r\nlured it on to its destruction by displaying the magnificent antlers of\r\nsome former victim above the birch-bushes !\r\n\r\nThey found a useful alley (sic) in a certain little traitorous bird to\r\nwhich the Indians have given the name of \xe2\x80\x9cmonitor.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a kind of\r\ndaylight owl, about the size of a pigeon, and has earned its name by its\r\nhabit of calling the attention of hunters to their quarry, by uttering a\r\nsharp note like the cry of a child.\r\n\r\nWhen about fifty reindeer, or, to give them their Indian name,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccaribous,\xe2\x80\x9d had been brought down by the guns, the flesh was cut\r\ninto long strips for food, the skins being kept to be tanned and used\r\nfor shoe-leather.\r\n\r\nBesides the caribous, there were also plenty of Polar hares, which\r\nformed an agreeable addition to the larder. They were much less timorous\r\nthan the European species, and allowed themselves to be caught in great\r\nnumbers. They belong to the rodent family, and have long ears, brown\r\neyes, and a soft fur resembling swan\xe2\x80\x99s down. They weigh from ten to\r\nfifteen pounds each, and their flesh is excellent. Hundreds of them were\r\ncared for winter use, and the remainder converted into excellent pies by\r\nthe skilful hands of Mrs Joliffe.\r\n\r\nWhile making provision for future wants, the daily supplies were not\r\nneglected. In addition to the Polar hares, which underwent every variety\r\nof culinary treatment from Mrs Joliffe, and won for her compliments\r\ninnumerable from hunters and workmen alike, many waterfowl figured in\r\nthe bill of fare. Besides the ducks which abounded on the shores of the\r\nlagoon, large flocks of grouse congregated round the clumps of stunted\r\nwillows. They belong, as their zoological name implies, to the partridge\r\nfamily, and might be aptly described as white partridges with long\r\nblack-spotted feathers in the tail. The Indians call them willow-fowl;\r\nbut to a European sportsman they are neither more nor less than\r\nblackcock (Tetrao tetrix). When roasted slightly before a quick clear\r\nfire they proved delicious.\r\n\r\nThen there were the supplies furnished by lake and stream. Sergeant\r\nLong was a first-rate angler, and nothing could surpass the skill and\r\npatience with which he whipped the water and cast his line. The faithful\r\nMadge, another worthy disciple of Isaak Walton was perhaps his only\r\nequal. Day after day the two sallied forth together rod in hand, to\r\nspend the day in mute companionship by the river-side, whence they were\r\nsure to return in triumph laden with some splendid specimens of the\r\nsalmon tribe.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our sportsmen; they soon found that their hunting\r\nexcursions were not to be free from peril. Hobson perceived with some\r\nalarm that bears were very numerous in the neighbourhood and that\r\nscarcely a day passed without one or more of them being sighted.\r\nSometimes these unwelcome visitors belonged to the family of brown\r\nbears, so common throughout the whole \xe2\x80\x9cCursed Land; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now and\r\nthen a solitary specimen of the formidable Polar bear warned the hunters\r\nwhat dangers they might have to encounter so soon as the first frost\r\nshould drive great numbers of these fearful animals to the neighbourhood\r\nof Cape Bathurst. Every book of Arctic explorations is full of accounts\r\nof the frequent perils to which travellers and whalers are exposed from\r\nthe ferocity of these animals.\r\n\r\nNow and then, too, a distant pack of wolves was seen, which receded like\r\na wave at the approach of the hunters, or the sound of their bark\r\nwas heard as they followed the trail of a reindeer or wapiti. These\r\ncreatures were large grey wolves, about three feet high, with long\r\ntails, whose fur becomes white in the winter. They abounded in this part\r\nof the country, where food was plentiful; and frequented wooded spots,\r\nwhere they lived in holes like foxes. During the temperate season,\r\nwhen they could get as much as they wanted to eat, they were scarcely\r\ndangerous, and fled with the characteristic cowardice of their race at\r\nthe first sign of pursuit; but when impelled by hunger, their numbers\r\nrendered them very formidable; and from the fact of their lairs being\r\nclose at hand, they never left the country even in the depth of winter.\r\n\r\nOne day the sportsmen returned to Fort Hope, bringing with them an\r\nunpleasant-looking animal, which neither Mrs Paulina Barnett nor the\r\nastronomer, Thomas Black, had ever before seen. It was a carnivorous\r\ncreature of the plantigrada family, and greatly resembled the American\r\nglutton, being strongly built, with short legs, and, like all animals of\r\nthe feline tribe, a very supple back; its eyes were small and horny, and\r\nit was armed with curved claws and formidable jaws.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this horrid creature?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Paulina Barnett of\r\nSabine, who replied in his usual sententious manner\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Scotchman would call it a \xe2\x80\x98quick-hatch,\xe2\x80\x99 an Indian an\r\n\xe2\x80\x98okelcoo-haw-gew,\xe2\x80\x99 and a Canadian a \xe2\x80\x98carcajou.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wolverene, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sabine, much delighted with the\r\nelegant way in which he had rounded his sentence.\r\n\r\nThe wolverene, as this strange quadruped is called by zoologists, lives\r\nin hollow trees or rocky caves, whence it issues at night and creates\r\ngreat havoc amongst beavers, musk-rats, and other rodents, sometimes\r\nfighting with a fox or a wolf for its spoils. Its chief characteristics\r\nare great cunning, immense muscular power, and an acute sense of smell.\r\nIt is found in very high latitudes; and the short fur with which it is\r\nclothed becomes almost black in the winter months, and forms a large\r\nitem in the Company\xe2\x80\x99s exports.\r\n\r\nDuring their excursions the settlers paid as much attention to the Flora\r\nof the country as to its Fauna; but in those regions vegetation, has\r\nnecessarily a hard struggle for existence, as it must brave every season\r\nof the year, whereas the animals are able to migrate to a warmer climate\r\nduring the winter.\r\n\r\nThe hills on the eastern side, of the lake were well covered with pine\r\nand fir trees; and Jaspar also noticed the \xe2\x80\x9ctacamahac,\xe2\x80\x9d a species of\r\npoplar which grows to a great height and shoots forth yellowish leaves\r\nwhich turn green in the autumn. These trees and larches were, however,\r\nfew and sickly looking, as if they found the oblique rays of the sun\r\ninsufficient to make them thrive. The black fir, or Norway spruce fir,\r\nthrove better, especially when situated in ravines well sheltered\r\nfrom the north wind. The young shoots of this tree are very\r\nvaluable, yielding a favourite beverage known in North America as \xe2\x80\x9c\r\nspruce-beer.\xe2\x80\x9d A good crop of these branchlets was gathered in and\r\nstored in the cellar of Fort Hope. There were also the dwarf birch,\r\na shrub about two feet high, native to very cold climates, and whole\r\nthickets of cedars, which are so valuable for fuel.\r\n\r\nOf vegetables which could be easily grown and used for food, this barren\r\nland yielded but few; and Mrs Joliffe, who took a great interest in \xe2\x80\x9c\r\neconomic \xe2\x80\x9c botany, only met with .two plants which were available in\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\nOne of these, a bulb, very difficult to classify, because its leaves\r\nfall off just at the flowering season, turned out to be a wild leek, and\r\nyielded a good crop of onions, each about the size of an egg.\r\n\r\nThe other plant was that known throughout North America as \xe2\x80\x9cLabrador\r\ntea;\xe2\x80\x9d it grew abundantly on the shores of the lagoon between the\r\nclumps of willow and arbutus, and formed the principal food of the\r\nPolar hares. Steeped in boiling water, and flavoured with a few drops of\r\nbrandy or gin, it formed an excellent beverage, and served to economise\r\nthe supply of China tea which the party had brought from Fort Reliance.\r\n\r\nKnowing the scarcity of vegetables, Jaspar Hobson had plenty of\r\nseeds with him, chiefly sorrel and scurvy-grass (Cochlearia), the\r\nantiscorbutic properties of which are invaluable in these latitudes. In\r\nchoosing the site of the settlement, such care bad been taken to find\r\na spot sheltered from the keen blasts, which shrivel vegetation like a\r\nfire, that there was every chance of these seeds yielding a good crop in\r\nthe ensuing season.\r\n\r\nThe dispensary of the new fort contained other antiscorbutics, in the\r\nshape of casks of lemon and lime juice, both of which are absolutely\r\nindispensable to an Arctic expedition. Still the greatest economy was\r\nnecessary with regard to the stores, as a long period of bad weather\r\nmight cut off the communication between Fort Hope and the southern\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. FIFTEEN MILES FROM CAPE BATHURST. September had now\r\ncommenced, and as upon the most favourable calculation only three more\r\nweeks would intervene before the bad season set in and interrupted the\r\nlabours of the explorers, the greatest haste was necessary in completing\r\nthe new buildings, and Mac-Nab and his workmen surpassed themselves\r\nin industry. The dog-house was on the eve of being finished, and very\r\nlittle remained to be done to the palisading which was, to encircle the\r\nfort. An inner court had been constructed, in the shape of a half-moon,\r\nfenced with tall pointed stakes, fifteen feet high, to which a postern\r\ngave entrance. Jaspar Hobson favoured the system of an unbroken\r\nenclosure with detached forts (a great improvement upon the tactics of\r\nVauban and Cormontaigne), and knew that to make his defence complete\r\nthe summit of Cape Bathurst, which was the key of the position, must be\r\nfortified; until that could be done, however, he thought the palisading\r\nwould be a sufficient protection, at least against quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to lay in a supply of oil and lights, and accordingly\r\nan expedition was organised to a spot about fifteen miles distant where\r\nseals were plentiful, Mrs Paulina Barnett being invited to accompany\r\nthe sportsmen, not indeed for the sake of watching the poor creatures\r\nslaughtered, but to satisfy her curiosity with regard to the country\r\naround Cape Bathurst, and to see some cliffs on that part of the\r\ncoast which were worthy of notice. The Lieutenant chose as his other\r\ncompanions, Sergeant Long, and the soldiers Petersen, Hope, and Kellet,\r\nand the party set off at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning in two sledges,\r\neach drawn by six dogs, on which the bodies of the seals were to be\r\nbrought back. The weather was fine, but the fog which lay low along the\r\nhorizon veiled the rays of the sun, whose yellow disk was now beginning\r\nto disappear for some hours during the night, a circumstance which\r\nattracted the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s attention, for reasons which we will\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nThat part of the shore to the west of Cape Bathurst rises but a few\r\ninches above the level of the sea, and the tides are-or are said\r\nto be-very high in the Arctic Ocean-many navigators, such as Parry,\r\nFranklin, the two Rosses, M\xe2\x80\x99Clure, and M\xe2\x80\x99Clintock, having observed\r\nthat when the sun and moon were in conjunction the waters were sometimes\r\ntwenty-five feet above the ordinary level. How then was it to be\r\nexplained that the sea did not at high tide inundate Cape Bathurst,\r\nwhich possessed no natural defences such as cliffs or downs? What\r\nwas it, in fact, which prevented the entire submersion of the whole\r\ndistrict, and the meeting of the waters of the lake with those of the\r\nArctic Ocean?\r\n\r\nJaspar Hobson could not refrain from remarking on this peculiarity to\r\nMrs Barnett, who replied somewhat hastily that she supposed that there\r\nwere-in spite of all that had been said to the contrary-no tides in the\r\nArctic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9call navigators agree that\r\nthe ebb and flow of Polar seas are very distinctly marked, and it\r\nis impossible to believe that they can have been mistaken on such a\r\nsubject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it, then,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this land is not\r\nflooded when it is scarcely ten feet above the sea level at low tide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just what puzzles me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have been\r\nattentively watching the tides all through this month, and during that\r\ntime they have not varied more than a foot, and I feel certain, that\r\neven during the September equinox, they will not rise more than a foot\r\nand a half all along the shores of Cape Bathurst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you not explain this phenomenon?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo conclusions are open\r\nto us, either of which I find it difficult to believe; such men as\r\nFranklin, Parry, Ross, and others, are mistaken, and there are no tides\r\non this part of the American coast; or, as in the Mediterranean, to\r\nwhich the waters of the Atlantic have not free ingress, the straits are\r\ntoo narrow to be affected by the ocean currents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe latter would appear to be the more reasonable hypothesis, Mr\r\nHobson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not, however, thoroughly satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I feel sure that if we could but find it, there is some simple\r\nand natural explanation of the phenomenon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a monotonous journey along a flat and sandy shore, the party\r\nreached their destination, and, having unharnessed the teams, they were\r\nleft behind lest they should startle the seals.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance around them, all were equally struck with the\r\ncontrast between the appearance of this district and that of Cape\r\nBathurst.\r\n\r\nHere the coast line was broken and fretted, showing manifest traces\r\nof its igneous origin; whereas the site of the fort was of sedimentary\r\nformation and aqueous origin. Stone, so conspicuously absent at the\r\ncape, was here plentiful; the black sand and porous lava were strewn\r\nwith huge boulders deeply imbedded in the soil, and there were large\r\nquantities of the aluminium, silica, and felspar pebbles peculiar to the\r\ncrystalline strata of one class of igneous rocks. Glittering Labrador\r\nstones, and many other kinds of felspar, red, green, and blue, were\r\nsprinkled on the unfrequented beach, with grey and yellow pummice-stone,\r\nand lustrous variegated obsidian. Tall cliffs, rising some two hundred\r\nfeet above the sea, frowned down upon the bay; and the Lieutenant\r\nresolved to climb them, and obtain a good view of the eastern side\r\nof the country. For this there was plenty of time, as but few of the\r\ncreatures they had come to seek were as yet to be seen, and the proper\r\ntime for the attack would be when they assembled for the afternoon\r\nsiesta in which the. amphibious mammalia always indulge. The Lieutenant,\r\nhowever, quickly discovered that the animals frequenting this coast were\r\nnot, as he had been led to suppose, true seals, although they belonged\r\nto the Phocid\xc3\xa6 family, but morses or walruses, sometimes called\r\nsea-cows. They resemble the seals in general form, but the canine teeth\r\nof the upper jaw curved down-wards are much more largely developed.\r\n\r\nFollowing the coast line, which curved considerably, and to which they\r\ngave the name of \xe2\x80\x9c Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay,\xe2\x80\x9d the party soon reached the foot\r\nof the cliff, and Petersen, Hope, and Kellet, took up their position\r\nas sentinels on the little promontory, whilst Mrs Barnett, Hobson, and\r\nLong, after promising not to lose sight of their comrades, and to be on\r\nthe look-out for their signal, proceeded to climb the cliff, the summit\r\nof which they reached in about a quarter of an hour. From this position\r\nthey were able to survey the whole surrounding country; at their feet\r\nlay the vast sea, stretching northwards as far as the eye .could\r\nreach, its expanse so entirely unbroken by islands or icebergs that\r\nthe travellers came to the conclusion, that this portion of the Arctic\r\nwaters was navigable as far as Behring Straits, and that during the\r\nsummer season the North-West Passage to Cape Bathurst would, be open to\r\nthe Company\xe2\x80\x99s ships. On the west, the aspect of the country explained\r\nthe presence of the volcanic d\xc3\xa9bris on the shore; for at a distance\r\nof about ten miles was a chain of granitic hills, of conical form, with\r\nblunted crests, looking as if their summits had been cut off, and\r\nwith jagged tremulous outlines standing out against the sky. They bad\r\nhitherto escaped the notice of our party, as they were concealed by the\r\ncliffs on the Cape Bathurst side, and Jaspar Hobson examined them in\r\nsilence, but with great attention, before he proceeded to study the\r\neastern side, which consisted of a long strip of perfectly level\r\ncoast-line stretching away to Cape Bathurst. Any one provided with a\r\ngood field-glass would have been able to distinguish the fort of Good\r\nHope, and perhaps even the cloud of blue smoke, which was no doubt at\r\nthat very moment issuing from Mrs Joliffe\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen chimney.\r\n\r\nThe country behind them seemed to possess two entirely distinct\r\ncharacters; to the east and south the cape was bounded by a vast plain,\r\nmany hundreds of square miles in extent, while behind the cliff, from\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay\xe2\x80\x9d to the mountains mentioned above, the country had\r\nundergone terrible convulsions, showing clearly that it owed its origin\r\nto volcanic eruptions. The Lieutenant was much struck with this marked\r\ncontrast, and Sergeant Long asked him whether he thought the mountains\r\non the western horizon were volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9call these pumice-stones and pebbles\r\nhave been discharged by them to this distance, and if we were to go two\r\nor three miles farther, we should find ourselves treading upon nothing\r\nbut lava and ashes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all these volcanoes\r\nare still active?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot tell you yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is no smoke issuing from any of them,\xe2\x80\x9d added the\r\nSergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat proves nothing; your pipe is not always in your mouth, and it is\r\njust the same with volcanoes, they are not always smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is a great puzzle to me how\r\nvolcanoes can exist at all. on Polar continents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there are not many of them !\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jaspar, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they are not so very rare\r\neither; they are to be found in Jan Mayen\xe2\x80\x99s Land, the Aleutian Isles,\r\nKamtchatka, Russian America, and Iceland, as well as in the Antarctic\r\ncircle, in Tierra del Fuego, and Australasia. They are the chimneys of\r\nthe great furnace in the centre of the earth, where Nature makes her\r\nchemical experiments, and it appears to me that the Creator of all\r\nthings has taken care to place these safety-valves wherever they were\r\nmost needed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet it does seem very\r\nstrange to find them in this icy climate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should they not be here as well as anywhere else, Sergeant? I\r\nshould say that ventilation holes are likely to be more numerous at the\r\nPoles than at the Equator !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Sergeant in much surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, if these safety-valves are forced open by the pressure\r\nof subterranean gases, it will most likely be at the spots where the\r\nsurface of the earth is thinest, and as the globe is flattened at the\r\npoles, it would appear natural that-but Kellet is making signs to us,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded the Lieutenant, breaking off abruptly; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you join us, Mrs\r\nBarnett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you. I will stay here until we return to the fort. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care to watch the walrus slaughtered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9conly don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to join us in an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s time, meanwhile you can enjoy the view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beach was soon reached, and some hundred walrus had collected,\r\neither waddling about on their clumsy webbed feet, or sleeping in family\r\ngroups. Some few of the larger males-creatures nearly four feet long,\r\nclothed with very short reddish fur-kept guard over the herd.\r\n\r\nGreat caution was required in approaching these formidable looking\r\nanimals, and the hunters took advantage of every bit of cover afforded\r\nby rocks and inequalities of the ground, so as to get within easy range\r\nof them and cut off their retreat to the sea.\r\n\r\nOn land these creatures are clumsy and awkward, moving in jerks or with\r\ncreeping motions like huge caterpillars, but in water -their native\r\nelement\xe2\x80\x94they are nimble and even graceful; indeed their strength is so\r\ngreat, that they have been known to overturn the whalers in pursuit of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs the hunters drew near the sentinels took alarm, and raising their\r\nheads looked searchingly around them; but before they could warn their\r\ncompanions of danger, Hobson and Kellet rushed upon them from one side,\r\nthe Sergeant, Petersen, and Hope from the other, and after lodging a\r\nball in each of their bodies, despatched them with their spears, whilst\r\nthe rest of the herd plunged into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe victory was an easy one; the five victims were very large and their\r\ntusks, though slightly rough, of the best quality. They were chiefly\r\nvaluable, however, on account of the oil; of which-being in excellent\r\ncondition-they would yield a large quantity. The bodies were packed in\r\nthe sledges, and proved no light weight for the dogs.\r\n\r\nIt was now one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and Mrs Barnett having joined them, the party\r\nset out on foot-the sledges being full-to return to the fort. There were\r\nbut ten miles to be traversed, but ten miles in a straight line is a\r\nweary journey, proving the truth of the adage \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long lane that\r\nhas no turning.\xe2\x80\x9d They beguiled the tediousness of the way by chatting\r\npleasantly, and Mrs Barnett was ready to join in the conversation, or to\r\nlisten with interest to the accounts the worthy soldiers gave of former\r\nadventures; but in spite of the brave struggle against ennui they\r\nadvanced but slowly, and the poor dogs found it hard work to drag the\r\nheavily-laden sledges over the rough ground. Had it been covered with\r\nfrozen snow the distance would have been accomplished in a couple of\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe merciful Lieutenant often ordered a halt to give the teams\r\nbreathing-time, and the Sergeant remarked that it would be much more\r\nconvenient for the inhabitants of the fort, if the morses would settle a\r\nlittle nearer Cape Bathurst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey could not find a suitable spot,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, with\r\na melancholy shake of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett with some surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they only congregate where the slope of the beach is gradual\r\nenough to allow of their creeping up easily from the sea. Now Cape\r\nBathurst rises abruptly, like a perpendicular wall, from water three\r\nhundred fathoms deep. It is probable that ages ago portion of the\r\ncontinent was rent away in some violent volcanic convulsion, and flung\r\ninto the Arctic Ocean. Hence the absence of morses on the beach of our\r\ncape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. TWO SHOTS. The first half of September passed rapidly away.\r\nHad Fort Hope been situated at the Pole itself, that is to say, twenty\r\ndegrees farther north, the polar night would have set in on the 21st of\r\nthat month But under the seventieth parallel the sun would be visible\r\nabove the horizon for another month. Nevertheless, the temperature was\r\nalready decidedly colder, the thermometer fell during the night to 31\xc2\xb0\r\nFahrenheit; and thin coatings of ice appeared here and there, to be\r\ndissolved again in the day-time.\r\n\r\nBut the settlers were able to await the coming of winter without alarm;\r\nthey had a more than sufficient store of provisions, their supply of\r\ndried venison had largely increased, another score of morses had been\r\nkilled, the tame rein-deer were warmly and comfortably housed, and\r\na huge wooden shed behind the house was filled with fuel. In short,\r\neverything was prepared for the Polar night.\r\n\r\nAnd now all the wants of the inhabitants of the fort being provided\r\nfor, it was time to think of the interests of the Company. The Arctic\r\ncreatures had now assumed their winter furs, and were therefore of the\r\ngreatest value, and Hobson organised shooting parties for the remainder\r\nof the fine weather, intending to set traps when the snow should prevent\r\nfurther excursions.\r\n\r\nThey would have plenty to do to satisfy the requirements of the Company,\r\nfor so far north it was of no use to depend on the Indians, who are\r\ngenerally the purveyors of the factories.\r\n\r\nThe first expedition was to the haunt of a family of beavers, long since\r\nnoted by the watchful Lieutenant, on a tributary of the stream already\r\nreferred to. It is true, the fur of the beaver is not now as valuable as\r\nwhen it was used for hats, and fetched \xc2\xa316 per kilogramme (rather\r\nmore than 2 lb.); but it still commands a high price as the animal is\r\nbecoming very scarce, in consequence of the reckless way in which it has\r\nbeen hunted.\r\n\r\nWhen the party reached their destination, the Lieutenant called Mrs\r\nBarnett\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the great ingenuity displayed by beavers in the\r\nconstruction of their submarine city. There were some hundred animals in\r\nthe little colony now to be invaded, and they lived together in pairs in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9choles\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cvaults\xe2\x80\x9d they had hollowed out near the stream.\r\nThey had already commenced their preparations for the winter, and were\r\nhard at work constructing their dams and laying up their piles of wood.\r\nA dam of admirable structure had already been built across the stream,\r\nwhich was deep and rapid enough not to freeze far below the surface,\r\neven in the severest weather. This dam, which was convex towards the\r\ncurrent, consisted of a collection of upright stakes interlaced with\r\nbranches and roots, the whole being cemented together and rendered\r\nwatertight with the clayey mud of the river, previously pounded by the\r\nanimals\xe2\x80\x99 feet. The beavers use their tails-which are large and flat,\r\nwith scales instead of hair at the root-for plastering over their\r\nbuildings and beating the clay into shape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe object of this dam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant to Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nto secure to the beavers a sufficient depth of water at all seasons of\r\nthe year, and to enable the engineers of the tribe to build the round\r\nhuts called houses or lodges, the tops of which you can just see. They\r\nare extremely solid structures, and the walls made of stick, clay,\r\nroots, &c., are two feet thick., They can only be entered from below\r\nthe water, and their owners have therefore to dive when they go home-an\r\nadmirable arrangement for their protection. Each lodge contains two\r\nstories; in the lower the winter stock of branches, bark, and roots,\r\nis laid up, and the upper is the residence of the householder and his\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is, however, not a beaver in sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthis a deserted village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe inhabitants are now all\r\nasleep and resting; they only work in the night, and we mean to surprise\r\nthem in their holes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was, in fact, easily done, and in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time about a hundred\r\nof the ill-fated rodents had been captured, twenty of which were of very\r\ngreat value, their fur being black, and therefore especially esteemed.\r\nThat of the others was also long, glossy, and silky, but of a reddish\r\nhue mixed with chestnut brown. Beneath the long fur, the beavers have a\r\nsecond coat of close short hair of a greyish-white colour.\r\n\r\nThe hunters returned to the fort much delighted with the result of\r\ntheir expedition. The beavers\xe2\x80\x99 skins were warehoused and labelled as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cparchments\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cyoung beavers,\xe2\x80\x9d according to their value.\r\n\r\nExcursions of a similar kind were carried on throughout the month of\r\nSeptember, and during the first half of October, with equally happy\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nA few badgers were taken, the skin being used as an ornament for the\r\ncollars of draught horses, and the hair for making brushes of every\r\nvariety. These carnivorous creatures belong to the bear family, and\r\nthe specimens obtained by Hobson were of the genus peculiar to North\r\nAmerica, sometimes called the Taxel badger.\r\n\r\nAnother animal of the rodent family, nearly as industrious as the\r\nbeaver, largely contributed to the stores of the Company. This was the\r\nmusk-rat or musquash. Its head and body are about a foot long and its\r\ntail ten inches. Its fur is in considerable demand. These creatures,\r\nlike the rest of their family, multiply with extreme rapidity, and a\r\ngreat number were easily unearthed.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of lynxes and wolverines or gluttons, fire-arms had to be\r\nused. The lynx has all the suppleness and agility of the feline tribe\r\nto which it belongs, and is formidable even to the rein-deer; Marbre and\r\nSabine were, however, well up to their work, and succeeded in killing\r\nmore than sixty of them. A few wolverines or gluttons were also\r\ndespatched, their fur is reddish-brown, and that of the lynx, light-red\r\nwith black spots; both are of considerable value.\r\n\r\nVery few ermines or stoats were seen, and Jaspar Hobson ordered his men\r\nto spare any which happened to cross their path until the winter, when\r\nthey should have assumed their beautiful snow-white coats with the\r\none black spot at the tip of the tail. At present the upper fur\r\nwas reddish-brown and the under yellowish white, so that, as Sabine\r\nexpressed it, it was desirable to let them \xe2\x80\x9c ripen,\xe2\x80\x9d or, in other\r\nwords,-to wait for the cold to bleach them.\r\n\r\nTheir cousins, the polecats, however, which emit so disagreeable an\r\nodour, fell victims in great numbers to the hunters, who either tracked\r\nthem to their homes in hollow trees, or shot them as they glided through\r\nthe branches.\r\n\r\nMartens, properly so-called, were hunted with great zeal. Their fur is\r\nin considerable demand, although not so valuable as that of the sable,\r\nwhich becomes a dark lustrous brown in the winter. The latter did not,\r\nhowever, come in the way of our hunters, as it only frequents the north\r\nof Europe and Asia as far as Kamtchatka, and is chiefly hunted by the\r\ninhabitants of Siberia. They had to be content with the polecats and\r\npine-martens, called \xe2\x80\x9c Canada- martens,\xe2\x80\x9d which frequent the shores\r\nof the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nAll the weasels and martens are very difficult to catch; they wriggle\r\ntheir long supple bodies through the smallest apertures with great ease,\r\nand thus elude their pursuers. In the winter, however, they are easily\r\ntaken in traps, and Marbre and Sabine looked forward to make up for lost\r\ntime then, when, said they, \xe2\x80\x9cthere shall be plenty of their furs in\r\nthe Company\xe2\x80\x99s stores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe have now only to mention the Arctic or blue and silver foxes, to\r\ncomplete the list of animals which swelled the profits of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBay Company.\r\n\r\nThe furs of these foxes are esteemed in the Russian and English markets\r\nabove all others, and that of the blue fox is the most valuable of all.\r\nThis pretty creature has a black muzzle, and the fur is not as one would\r\nsuppose blue, but whitish-brown; its great price-six times that of any\r\nother kind-arises from its superior softness, thickness, and length. A\r\ncloak belonging to the Emperor of Russia, composed entirely of fur from\r\nthe neck of the blue fox (the fur from the neck is considered better\r\nthan that from any other part), was shown at the London Exhibition of\r\n1851, and valued at \xc2\xa33400 sterling.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these foxes were sighted at Cape Bathurst, but all escaped\r\nthe hunters; whilst only about a dozen silver foxes fell into their\r\nhands. The fur of the latter-of a lustrous black dotted with white-is\r\nmuch sought after in England and Russia, although it does not command so\r\nhigh a price as that of the foxes mentioned above.\r\n\r\nOne of the silver foxes captured was a splendid creature, with a\r\ncoal-black fur tipped with white at the extreme end of the tail, and\r\nwith a dash of the some on the forehead. The circumstances attending its\r\ndeath deserve relation in detail, as they proved that Hobson was right\r\nin the precautions he had taken\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 24th September, two sledges conveyed Mrs Barnett,\r\nthe Lieutenant, Sergeant Long. Marbre, and Sabine, to Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay.\r\nSome traces of foxes had been noticed the evening before, amongst some\r\nrocks clothed with scanty herbage and the direction taken by the animals\r\nwas very clearly indicated. The hunters followed up the trail of a large\r\nanimal, and were rewarded by bringing down a very fine silver fox.\r\n\r\nSeveral other animals of the same species were sighted, and the hunters\r\ndivided into two parties-Marbre and Sabine going after one foe, and\r\nMrs Barnett, Hobson, and the Sergeant, trying to cut off the retreat of\r\nanother fine animal hiding behind some rocks.\r\n\r\nGreat caution and some artifice was necessary to deal with this crafty\r\nanimal, which took care not to expose itself to a shot. The pursuit\r\nlasted for half-an-hour without success; but at last the poor creature,\r\nwith the sea on one side and its three enemies on the other, had\r\nrecourse in its desperation to a flying leap, thinking thus to escape\r\nwith its life. But Hobson was too quick for it; and as it bounded by\r\nlike a flash of lightning, it was struck by a shot, and to every one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsurprise, the report of the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s gun was succeeded by that of\r\nanother, and a second ball entered the body of the fox, which fell to\r\nthe ground mortally wounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah !\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cit is mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine!\xe2\x80\x9d said another voice, and a stranger stept forward and\r\nplaced his foot upon the fox just as the Lieutenant was about to raise\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHobson drew back in astonishment. He thought the second ball had been\r\nfired by the Sergeant, and found himself face to face with a stranger\r\nwhose gun was still smoking.\r\n\r\nThe rivals gazed at each other in silence.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party now approached, and the stranger was quickly\r\njoined by twelve comrades, four of whom were like himself \xe2\x80\x9c Canadian\r\ntravellers,\xe2\x80\x9d and eight Chippeway Indians.\r\n\r\nThe leader was a tall man-a fine specimen of his class-those Canadian\r\ntrappers described in the romances of Washington Irving, whose\r\ncompetition Hobson had dreaded with such good reason. He wore the\r\ntraditional costume ascribed to his fellow-hunters by the great American\r\nwriter; a blanket loosely arranged about his person, a striped cotton\r\nshirt, wide cloth trousers, leather gaiters, deerskin mocassins, and a\r\nsash of checked woollen stuff round the waist, from which were suspended\r\nhis knife, tobacco-pouch, pipe, and a few useful tools.\r\n\r\nHobson was right. The man before him was a Frenchman, or at least a\r\ndescendant of the French Canadians, perhaps an agent of the American\r\nCompany come to act as a spy on the settlers in the fort. The other four\r\nCanadians wore a costume resembling that of their leader, but of coarser\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman bowed politely to Mrs Barnett, and the Lieutenant was the\r\nfirst to break the silence, during which he had not removed his eyes\r\nfrom his rival\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fox is mine, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is if you killed it !\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other in good English, but\r\nwith a slightly foreign accent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson rather sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cit is mine in\r\nany case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger smiled. scornfully at this lofty reply, so exactly what\r\nbe expected from an agent of the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company, which claims\r\nsupremacy over all the northern districts, from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, gracefully toying with his\r\ngun, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you consider the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company mistress of the\r\nwhole of North America?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cand if, as I imagine, you belong\r\nto an American company\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the St Louis Fur Company,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger with a bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will find it difficult\r\nto show the grants entitling you to any privileges here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrants! privileges !\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Canadian scornfully, \xe2\x80\x9cold world\r\nterms which are out of place in America !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not now on American but on English ground,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nLieutenant proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no time for such a discussion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hunter rather\r\nwarmly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know the old claims made by the English in general,\r\nand the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company in particular, to these hunting grounds;\r\nbut I expect coming events will soon alter this state of things, and\r\nAmerica will be America from the Straits of Magellan to the North Pole\r\n!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, however that may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Canadian, \xe2\x80\x9clet us\r\nsuffer this international question to remain in abeyance for the\r\npresent. Whatever rights the Company may arrogate to itself, it is very\r\nclear that in the extreme north of the continent, and especially on the\r\ncoast, the territory belongs to whoever occupies it. You have founded a\r\nfactory on Cape Bathurst, therefore we will respect your domain, and\r\nyou on your side will avoid ours, when the St Louis fur-traders have\r\nestablished their projected fort at another point on the northern shore\r\nof America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant frowned at this speech, for he well knew what\r\ncomplications would arise in the future when the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company\r\nwould be compelled to struggle for supremacy with powerful rivals, and\r\nthat quarrelling and even bloodshed would ensue; he could not, however,\r\nbut acknowledge that this was not the time to begin the discussion, and\r\nhe was not sorry when the hunter, whose manners, to tell the truth, were\r\nvery polite, placed the dispute on another footing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for this present matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Canadian, \xe2\x80\x9cit is of minor\r\nimportance, and we must settle it according to the rules of the\r\nchase. Our guns are of different calibre, and our balls can be easily\r\ndistinguished; let the fox belong to whichever of us really killed\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proposition was a fair one, and the body of the victim was examined\r\naccordingly. One ball had entered at the side, the other at the heart;\r\nand the latter was from the gun of the Canadian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fox is your property, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jaspar Hobson, vainly\r\nendeavouring to conceal his chagrin at seeing this valuable spoil fall\r\ninto the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian took it, but instead of throwing it over his shoulder and\r\ncarrying it off, he turned to Mrs Barnett, and said \xe2\x80\x9c Ladies are\r\nfond of beautiful furs, and although, perhaps, if they knew better what\r\ndangers and difficulties have to be surmounted in order to obtain them,\r\nthey might not care so much about them, they are not likely to refuse\r\nto wear them on that account, and I hope, madam, you will favour me by\r\naccepting this one in remembrance of our meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett hesitated for a moment, but the gift was offered with\r\nso much courtesy and kindliness of manner, that it would have seemed\r\nchurlish to refuse, and she therefore accepted it with many thanks.\r\n\r\nThis little ceremony over, the stranger again bowed politely, and,\r\nfollowed by his comrades, quickly disappeared behind the rocks, whilst\r\nthe Lieutenant and his party returned to Fort Good Hope. Hobson was very\r\nsilent and thoughtful all the way; for he could not but feel that the\r\nexistence of a rival company would greatly compromise the success of his\r\nundertaking, and lead to many future difficulties.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. THE APPROACH OF WINTER. It was the 21st of September. The\r\nsun was then passing through the autumnal equinox, that is to say, the\r\nday and night were of equal length all over the world. These successive\r\nalternations of light and darkness were hailed with delight by the\r\ninhabitants of the fort. It is easier to sleep in the absence of the\r\nsun, and darkness refreshes and strengthens the eyes, weary with the\r\nunchanging brightness of several months of daylight.\r\n\r\nWe know that during the equinox the tides are generally at their\r\ngreatest height; we have high water or flood, for the sun and moon\r\nbeing in conjunction, their double influence is brought to bear upon the\r\nwaters. It was, therefore, necessary to note carefully the approaching\r\ntide at Cape Bathurst. Jaspar Hobson had made bench marks some days\r\nbefore, so as to estimate exactly the amount of vertical displacement of\r\nthe waters between high and low tide; he found, however, that in spite\r\nof all the reports of previous observers, the combined solar and lunar\r\ninfluence was hardly felt in this part of the Arctic Ocean. There\r\nwas scarcely any tide at all, and the statements of navigators on the\r\nsubject were contradicted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is certainly something unnatural here !\xe2\x80\x9d said Lieutenant\r\nHobson to himself.\r\n\r\nHe did not in fact know what to think, but other cares soon occupied\r\nhis mind, and he did not long endeavour to get to the rights of this\r\nsingular peculiarity.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th September the state of the atmosphere changed considerably.\r\nThe thermometer fell to 41\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit, and the sky became covered with\r\nclouds which were soon converted into heavy rain. The bad season was\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nBefore the ground should be covered with snow, Mrs Joliffe was busy\r\nsowing the seeds of Cochlearia (scurvy grass) and sorrel, in the hope\r\nthat as they were very hardy, and would be well protected from the\r\nrigour of the winter by the snow itself, they would come up in the\r\nspring. Her garden, consisting of several acres hidden behind the cliff\r\nof the cape, had been prepared beforehand, and it was sown during the\r\nlast days of September.\r\n\r\nHobson made his companions assume their winter garments before the\r\ngreat cold set in, and all were soon suitably clothed in the linen under\r\nvests, deerskin cloaks, sealskin pantaloons, fur bonnets, and waterproof\r\nboots with which they were provided. We may also say that the rooms were\r\nsuitably dressed; the wooden walls were hung with skins, in order to\r\nprevent the formation upon them of coats of ice in sudden falls of\r\ntemperature. About this time, Rae set up his condensers for collecting\r\nthe vapour suspended in the air, which were to be emptied twice a week.\r\nThe heat of the stove was regulated according to the variations of the\r\nexternal temperature, so as to keep the thermometer of the rooms at 50\xc2\xb0\r\nFahrenheit. The house would soon be covered with thick snow, which would\r\nprevent any waste of the internal warmth, and by this combination of\r\nnatural and artificial protections they hoped to be able successfully to\r\ncontend with their two most formidable enemies, cold and damp.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd October the thermometer fell still lower, and the first snow\r\nstorm came on; there was but little wind, and there were therefore none\r\nof those violent whirlpools of snow called drifts, but a vast white\r\ncarpet of uniform thickness soon clothed the cape, the enceinte of fort,\r\nand the coast. The waters of the lake and sea, not yet petrified by\r\nthe icy hand of winter, were of a dull, gloomy, greyish hue, and on the\r\nnorthern horizon the first icebergs stood out against the misty sky. The\r\nblockade had not yet commenced, but nature was collecting her materials,\r\nsoon to be cemented by the cold into an impenetrable barrier.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9c young ice \xe2\x80\x9c was rapidly forming on the liquid surfaces of sea\r\nand lake. The lagoon was the first to freeze over; large whitish-grey\r\npatches appeared here and there, signs of a hard frost setting in,\r\nfavoured by the calmness of the atmosphere. and after a night during\r\nwhich the thermometer had remained at 15\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit, the surface\r\nof the lake was smooth and firm enough to satisfy the most fastidious\r\nskaters of the Serpentine. On the verge of the horizon, the sky assumed\r\nthat peculiar appearance which whalers call ice-blink, and which is the\r\nresult of the glare of light reflected obliquely from the surface of\r\nthe ice against the opposite atmosphere. Vast tracts of the ocean became\r\ngradually solidified, the ice-fields, formed by the accumulation of\r\nicicles, became welded to the coast, presenting a surface broken and\r\ndistorted by the action of the waves, and contrasting strongly with the\r\nsmooth mirror of the lake. Here and there floated these long pieces,\r\nscarcely cemented together at the edges, known as \xe2\x80\x9c drift ice,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9c hummocks,\xe2\x80\x9d or protuberances caused by the squeezing of one\r\npiece against another, were also of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the aspect of Cape Bathurst and the surrounding districts\r\nwas completely changed. Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s delight and enthusiasm knew no\r\nbounds; everything was new to her, and she would have thought no fatigue\r\nor suffering too great to be endured for the sake of witnessing such a\r\nspectacle. She could imagine nothing more sublime than this invasion of\r\nwinter with all its mighty forces, this conquest of the northern regions\r\nby the cold. All trace of the distinctive features of the country had\r\ndisappeared; the land was metamorphosed, a new country was springing\r\ninto being before her admiring eyes, a country gifted with a grand and\r\ntouching beauty. Details were lost, only the large outlines were given,\r\nscarcely marked out against the misty sky. One transformation scene\r\nfollowed another with magic rapidity. The ocean, which but lately lifted\r\nup its mighty waves, was hushed and still; the verdant soil of various\r\nhues was replaced by a carpet of dazzling whiteness; the woods of trees\r\nof different kinds were converted into groups of gaunt skeletons draped\r\nin hoar-frost; the radiant orb of day had become a pale disc, languidly\r\nrunning its allotted course in the thick fog, and visible but for a few\r\nhours a day, whilst the sea horizon, no longer clearly cut against the\r\nsky, was hidden by an endless chain of ice-bergs, broken into countless\r\nrugged forms, and building up that impenetrable ice-wall, which Nature\r\nhas set up between the Pole and the bold explorers who endeavour to\r\nreach it.\r\n\r\nWe can well understand to how many discussions and conversations the\r\naltered appearance of the country gave rise. Thomas Black was the only\r\none who remained indifferent to the sublime beauty of the scene. But\r\nwhat could one expect of an astronomer so wrapped up in his one idea,\r\nthat he might be said to be present in the little colony in the body,\r\nbut absent in spirit? He lived in the contemplation of the heavenly\r\nbodies, passing from the examination of one constellation to that of\r\nanother, roving in imagination through the vast realms of space, peopled\r\nby countless radiant orbs, and fuming with rage when fogs or clouds\r\nhid the objects of his devotion from his sight. Hobson consoled him\r\nby promising him fine cold nights admirably suited to astronomical\r\nobservations, when he could watch the beautiful Aurora Borealis, the\r\nlunar halos, and other phenomena of Polar countries worthy even of his\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nThe cold was not at this time too intense; there was no wind, and it\r\nis the wind which makes the cold so sharp and biting. Hunting was\r\nvigorously carried on for some days. The magazines became stocked with\r\nnew furs, and fresh stores of provisions were laid up. Partridges and\r\nptarmigans on their way to the south passed over the fort in great\r\nnumbers, and supplied fresh and wholesome meat. Polar or Arctic hares\r\nwere plentiful, and had already assumed their white winter robes. About\r\na hundred of these rodents formed a valuable addition to the reserves of\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nThere were also large flocks of the whistling swan or hooper, one of the\r\nfinest species of North America. The hunters killed several couples of\r\nthem, handsome birds, four or five feet in entire length, with white\r\nplumage, touched with copper colour on the head and upper part of neck.\r\nThey were on their way to a more hospitable zone, where they could find\r\nthe aquatic plants and insects they required for food, and they sped\r\nthrough the air at a rapid pace, for it is as much their native element\r\nas water. Trumpeter swans, with a cry like the shrill tone of a clarion,\r\nwhich are about the same size as the hoopers, but have black feet and\r\nbeaks, also passed in great numbers, but neither Marbre nor Sabine were\r\nfortunate enough to bring down any of them. However, they shouted out\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cau revoir\xe2\x80\x9d in significant tones, for they knew that they would\r\nreturn with the first breezes of spring and that they could then be\r\neasily caught. Their skin, plumage, and down, are all of great value,\r\nand they are therefore eagerly hunted. In some favourable years tens of\r\nthousands of them have been exported, fetching half a guinea a piece.\r\n\r\nDuring these excursions, which only lasted for a few hours, and were\r\noften interrupted by bad weather, packs of wolves were often met with.\r\nThere was no need to go far to find them, for, rendered bold by hunger,\r\nthey already ventured close to the factory. Their scent is very keen,\r\nand they were attracted by the smell from the kitchen. During the\r\nnight they could be heard howling in a threatening manner. Although\r\nnot dangerous individually, these carnivorous beasts are formidable in\r\npacks, and the hunters therefore took care to be well armed when they\r\nwent beyond the enceinte of the fort.\r\n\r\nThe bears were still more aggressive. Not a day passed without several\r\nof these animals being seen. At night they would come close up to the\r\nenclosure, and sane were even wounded with shot, but got off, staining\r\nthe snow with their blood, so that up to October 10th not one had left\r\nits warm and valuable fur in the hands of the hunters. Hobson would not\r\nhave them molested, rightly judging that with such formidable creatures\r\nit was best to remain on the defensive, and it was not improbable that,\r\nurged on by hunger, they might attack Fort Hope before very long. Then\r\nthe little colony could defend itself, and provision its stores at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nFor a few days the weather continued dry and cold, the surface of the\r\nsnow was firm and suitable for walking, so that a few excursions were\r\nmade without difficulty along the coast on the south of the fort. The\r\nLieutenant was anxious to ascertain if the agents of the St Louis Fur\r\nCompany had left the country. No traces were, however, found of their\r\nreturn march, and it was therefore concluded that they had gone down to\r\nsome southern fort to pass the winter by another route.\r\n\r\nThe few fine days were soon over, and in the first week of November the\r\nwind veered round to the south, making the temperature warmer, it is\r\ntrue, but also bringing heavy snow-storms. The ground was soon covered\r\nwith a soft cushion several feet thick, which had to be cleared away\r\nround the house every day, whilst a lane was made through it to the\r\npostern, the shed, and the stable of the dogs and rein-deer. Excursions\r\nbecame more and more rare, and it was impossible to walk without\r\nsnow-shoes.\r\n\r\nWhen the snow has become hardened by frost, it easily sustains the\r\nweight of a man; but when it is soft and yielding, and the unfortunate\r\npedestrian sinks into it up to his knees, the snow-shoes used by Indians\r\nare invaluable.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson and his companions were quite accustomed to walk in\r\nthem, and could glide about over the snow as rapidly as skaters on ice;\r\nMrs Barnett had early practised wearing them, and was quite as expert in\r\ntheir use as the rest of the party. The frozen lake as well as the coast\r\nwas scoured by these indefatigable explorers, who were even able to\r\nadvance several miles from the shore on the solid surface of the ocean\r\nnow covered with ice several feet thick. It was, however, very tiring\r\nwork, for the ice-fields were rugged and uneven, strewn with piled-up\r\nridges of ice and hummocks which had to be turned. Further out a chain\r\nof icebergs, some five hundred feet high, barred their progress. These\r\nmighty icebergs, broken into fantastic and picturesque forms, were a\r\ntruly magnificent spectacle. Here they looked like the whitened ruins of\r\na town with curtains battered in, and monuments and columns overthrown;\r\nthere like some volcanic land torn and convulsed by earthquakes and\r\neruptions; a confusion of glaciers and glittering ice-peaks with snowy\r\nramparts and buttresses, valleys, and crevasses, mountains and hillocks,\r\ntossed and distorted like the famous Alps of Switzerland. A few\r\nscattered birds, petrels, guillemots, and puffins, lingering behind\r\ntheir fellows, still enlivened the vast solitude with their piercing\r\ncries; huge white bears roamed about amongst the hummocks, their\r\ndazzling coats scarcely distinguishable from the shining ice-truly there\r\nwas enough to interest and excite our adventurous lady traveller, and\r\neven Madge, the faithful Madge, shared the enthusiasm of her mistress.\r\nHow far, how very far, were both from the tropic zones of India or\r\nAustralia!\r\n\r\nThe frozen ocean was firm enough to have allowed of the passage of a\r\npark of artillery, or the erection of a monument, and many were the\r\nexcursions on its surface until the sudden lowering of the temperature\r\nrendered all exertion so exhausting that they had to be discontinued.\r\nThe pedestrians were out of breath after taking a few steps, and the\r\ndazzling whiteness of the glittering snow could not be endured by\r\nthe naked eye; indeed, the reverberation or flickering glare of the\r\nundulatory reflection of the light from the surface of the snow, has\r\nbeen known to cause several cases of blindness amongst the Esquimaux.\r\n\r\nA singular phenomenon due to the refraction of rays of light was now\r\nobserved: distances, depths, and heights lost their true proportions,\r\nfive or six yards of ice looked like two, and many were the falls and\r\nludicrous results of this optical illusion.\r\n\r\nOn October 14th the thermometer marked 3\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit below zero, a\r\nsevere temperature to endure, especially when the north wind blows\r\nstrongly. The air seemed to be made of needles, and those who ventured\r\nout of the house were in great danger of being frost-bitten, when death\r\nor mortification would ensue if the suspended circulation of the blood\r\nwere not restored by immediate friction with snow. Garry, Belcher, Hope,\r\nand other members of the little community were attacked by frost-bite,\r\nbut the parts affected being rubbed in time they escaped without serious\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be understood that all manual labour had now become\r\nimpossible. The days were extremely short, the sun was only above\r\nthe horizon for a few hours and the actual winter, implying entire\r\nconfinement within doors, was about to commence. The last Arctic birds\r\nforsook the gloomy shores of the Polar Sea, only a few pairs of those\r\nspeckled quails remained which the Indians appropriately call \xe2\x80\x9c winter\r\nbirds,\xe2\x80\x9d because they wait in the Arctic regions until the commencement\r\nof the Polar night, but they too were soon to take their departure.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson, therefore, urged on the setting of the traps\r\nand snares which were to remain in different parts of Cape Bathurst\r\nthroughout the winter.\r\n\r\nThese traps consisted merely of rough joists supported on a square,\r\nformed of three pieces of wood so balanced as to fall on the least\r\ntouch--in fact, the same sort of trap as that used for snaring birds\r\nin fields on a large scale. The end of the horizontal piece of wood was\r\nbaited with venison, and every animal of a moderate height, a fox or a\r\nmarten, for instance, which touched it with its paw, could not fail\r\nto be crushed. Such were the traps set in the winter over a space of\r\nseveral miles by the famous hunters whose adventurous life has been so\r\npoetically described by Cooper. Some thirty of these snares were set\r\nround Fort Hope, and were to be visited at pretty frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th November a new member was born to the little colony. Mrs\r\nMac-Nab was safely confined of a fine healthy boy, of whom the head\r\ncarpenter was extremely proud. Mrs Barnett stood god-mother to the\r\nchild, which received the name of Michael Hope. The ceremony of baptism\r\nwas performed with considerable solemnity, and a kind of f\xc3\xaate was held\r\nin honour of the little creature which had just come into the world\r\nbeyond the 70th degree N. Lat.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, on November .20th, the sun sunk below the horizon\r\nnot to appear again for two months. The Polar night had commenced!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE POLAR NIGHT. The long night was ushered in by a\r\nviolent storm. The cold was perhaps a little less severe, but the\r\nair was very damp, and, in spite of every precaution, the humidity\r\npenetrated into the house, and the condensers, which were emptied every\r\nmorning, contained several pounds of ice.\r\n\r\nOutside drifts whirled past like waterspouts-the snow seemed no longer\r\nto fall horizontally but vertically. The Lieutenant was obliged to\r\ninsist upon the door being kept shut, for had it been opened the\r\npassages would immediately have become blocked up. The explorers were\r\nliterally prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe window shutters were hermetically closed, and the lamps were kept\r\nburning through the long hours of the sleepless night.\r\n\r\nBut although darkness reigned without, the noise of the tempest replaced\r\nthe silence usually so complete in these high latitudes. The roaring of\r\nthe wind between the house and the cliff never ceased for a moment, the\r\nhouse trembled to its foundations, and had it not been for the solidity\r\nof its construction, must have succumbed to the violence of the\r\nhurricane. Fortunately the accumulation of snow round the walls broke\r\nthe force of the squall, and Mac-Nabs only fear was for the chimneys,\r\nwhich were liable to be blown over. However, they remained firm,\r\nalthough they had constantly to be freed from the snow which blocked up\r\nthe openings.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the whistling of the wind, loud reports were heard, of\r\nwhich Mrs Barnett could not conjecture the cause. It was the falling\r\nof icebergs in the offing. The echoes caught up the sounds, which were\r\nrolled along like the reverberations of thunder. The ground shook as the\r\nice-fields split open, crushed by the falling of these mighty mountains,\r\nand none but those thoroughly inured to the horrors of these wild\r\nrugged climates could witness these strange phenomena without a shudder.\r\nLieutenant Hobson and his companions were accustomed to all these\r\nthings, and Mrs Barnett and Madge were gradually becoming so, and were,\r\nbesides, not altogether unfamiliar with those terrible winds which move\r\nat the rate of forty miles an hour, and overturn twenty-four pounders.\r\nHere, however, the darkness and the snow aggravated the dread might of\r\nthe storm; that which was not crushed was buried and smothered, and,\r\nprobably twelve hours after the commencement of the tempest, house,\r\nkennel, shed, and enceinte would have disappeared beneath a bed of snow\r\nof uniform thickness.\r\n\r\nThe time was not wasted during this long imprisonment. All these good\r\npeople agreed together perfectly, and neither ill-humour nor ennui\r\nmarred the contentment of the little party shut up in such a narrow\r\nspace. They were used to life under similar conditions at Forts\r\nEnterprise and Reliance, and there was nothing to excite Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsurprise in their ready accommodation of themselves to circumstances.\r\n\r\nPart of the day was occupied with work, part with reading and games.\r\nGarments had to be made and mended, arms to be kept bright and in good\r\nrepair, boots to be manufactured, and the daily journal to be issued in\r\nwhich Lieutenant Hobson recorded the slightest events of this northern\r\nwintering-the weather, the temperature, the direction of the wind, the\r\nappearance of meteors so frequent in the Polar regions, &c., &c. Then\r\nthe house had to be kept in order, the rooms must be swept, and the\r\nstores of furs must be visited every day to see if they were free from\r\ndamp; the fires and stoves, too, required constant superintendence,\r\nand perpetual vigilance was necessary to prevent the accumulation of\r\nparticles of moisture in the corners.\r\n\r\nTo each one was assigned a task, the duty of each one was laid down in\r\nrules fixed up in the large room, so that without being overworked, the\r\noccupants of the fort were never without something to do. Thomas Black\r\nscrewed and unscrewed his instruments, and looked over his astronomical\r\ncalculations, remaining almost always shut up in his cabin, fretting\r\nand fuming at the storm which prevented him from making nocturnal\r\nobservations. The three married women had also plenty to see to : Mrs\r\nMac-Nab busied herself with her baby who got on wonderfully, whilst Mrs\r\nJoliffe, assisted by Mrs Rae, and with the Corporal always at her heels,\r\npresided in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhen work was done the entire party assembled in the large room,\r\nspending the whole of Sunday together. Reading was the chief amusement.\r\nThe Bible and some books of travels were the whole library of the fort;\r\nbut they were all the good folks required. Mrs Barnett generally read\r\naloud, and her audience listened with delight. The Bible and accounts\r\nof adventures received a fresh charm when read out in her clear earnest\r\nvoice; her gestures were so expressive that imaginary persons seemed\r\nto live when she spoke of them, and all were glad when she took up the\r\nbook. She was, in fact, the life and soul of the little community, eager\r\nalike to give and receive instruction; she combined the charm and grace\r\nof a woman with the energy of a man, and she consequently became the\r\nidol of the rough soldiers, who would have willingly laid down their\r\nlives in her service. Mrs Barnett shared everything with her companions,\r\nnever holding herself aloof or remaining shut up in her cabin, but\r\nworking zealously amongst the others, drawing out the most reticent by\r\nher intelligent questions and warm sympathy. Good humour and good health\r\nprevailed throughout the little community, and neither bands nor tongues\r\nwere idle.\r\n\r\nThe storm, however, showed no signs of abating. The party had now been\r\nconfined to the house for three days, and the snow-drifts were as wild\r\nand furious as ever. Lieutenant Hobson began to get anxious. It was\r\nbecoming imperatively necessary to renew the air of the rooms, which\r\nwas too much charged with carbonic acid. The light of the lamps began to\r\npale in the unhealthy atmosphere, and the air-pumps would not act, the\r\npipes being choked up with ice; they were not, in fact, intended to\r\nbe used when the house was buried in snow. It was necessary to take\r\ncounsel; the Lieutenant and Sergeant Long put their heads together, and\r\nit was decided on November 23d that, as the wind beat with rather less\r\nviolence on the front of the house, one of the windows at the end of the\r\npassage on that side should be opened.\r\n\r\nThis was no light matter. It was easy enough to open the window from\r\ninside, but the shutter outside was encrusted over with thick lumps of\r\nice, and resisted every effort to move it. It had to be taken off its\r\nhinges, and the hard mass of snow was then attacked with pickaxe and\r\nshovel; it was at least ten feet thick, and it was not until a kind of\r\nchannel bad been scooped out that the outer air was admitted.\r\n\r\nHobson, the Sergeant, several soldiers, and Mrs Barnett herself ventured\r\nto creep through this tunnel or channel, but not without considerable\r\ndifficulty, for the wind rushed in with fearful fury.\r\n\r\nWhat a scene was presented by Cape Bathurst and the surrounding plain.\r\nIt was mid-day, and but a few faint twilight rays glimmered upon\r\nthe southern horizon. The cold was not so intense as one would have\r\nsupposed, and the thermometer marked only 15\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit above zero;\r\nbut the snow-drifts whirled along with terrific force, and all would\r\ninevitably have been thrown to the ground, had not the snow in which\r\nthey were standing up to their waists helped to sustain them against\r\nthe gusts of wind. Everything around them was white, the walls of the\r\nenceinte, and the whole of the house even to the roof were completely\r\ncovered over, and nothing but a few blue wreaths of smoke would have\r\nbetrayed the existence of a human habitation to a stranger.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances the \xe2\x80\x9c promenade \xe2\x80\x9c was soon over; but Mrs\r\nBarnett bad made good use of her time, and would never forget the awful\r\nbeauty of the Polar regions in a snow-storm, a beauty upon which few\r\nwomen had been privileged to look.\r\n\r\nA few moments sufficed to renew the atmosphere of the house, and all\r\nunhealthy vapours were quickly dispersed by the introduction of a pure\r\nand refreshing current of air.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant and his companions hurried in, and the window was again\r\nclosed; but after that the snow before it was removed every day for the\r\nsake of ventilation.\r\n\r\nThe entire week passed in a similar manner; fortunately the rein-deer\r\nand dogs had plenty of food, so that there was no need to visit them.\r\nThe eight days during which the occupants of the fort were imprisoned so\r\nclosely, could not fail to be somewhat irksome to strong men, soldiers\r\nand hunters, accustomed to plenty of exercise in the open air; and we\r\nmust own that listening to reading aloud gradually lost its charm, and\r\neven cribbage became uninteresting. The last thought at night was a hope\r\nthat the tempest might have ceased in the morning, a hope disappointed\r\nevery day. Fresh snow constantly accumulated upon the windows, the wind\r\nroared, the icebergs burst with a crash like thunder, the smoke was\r\nforced back into the rooms, and there were no signs of a diminution of\r\nthe fury of the storm.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, on the 28th November the Aneroid barometer in the\r\nlarge room gave notice of an approaching change in the state of the\r\natmosphere. It rose rapidly, whilst the thermometer outside fell almost\r\nsuddenly to less than four degrees below zero. These were symptoms which\r\ncould not be mistaken, and on the 29th November the silence all around\r\nthe fort told that the tempest had ceased.\r\n\r\nEvery one was eager to get out, tine confinement had lasted long enough.\r\nThe door could not be opened, and all had to get through the window, and\r\nclear away the fresh accumulation of snow; this time, however, it was no\r\nsoft mass they had to remove, but compact blocks of ice, which required\r\npick-axes to break them up.\r\n\r\nIt took about half-an-hour to clear a passage, and then every one in the\r\nfort, except Mrs Mac-Nab, who was not yet up, hastened into the interior\r\ncourt, glad once more to be able to walk about.\r\n\r\nThe cold was still intense, but the wind having gone down it was\r\npossible to endure it, although great care was necessary to escape\r\nserious consequences on leaving the heated rooms for the open air,\r\nthe difference between the temperature inside and outside being some\r\nfifty-four degrees.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. Myriads of brilliant\r\nconstellations studded the sky, and at the zenith shone the Pole star.\r\nAlthough in both hemispheres there are in reality but 5000 fixed\r\nstars visible to the naked eye, their number appeared to the observers\r\nincalculable. Exclamations of admiration burst involuntarily from the\r\nlips of the delighted astronomer as he gazed into the cloudless heavens,\r\nonce more undimmed by mists or vapours. Never had a more beautiful sky\r\nbeen spread out before the eyes of an astronomer.\r\n\r\nWhilst Thomas Black was raving in ecstasy, dead to all terrestrial\r\nmatters, his companions had wandered as far as the enceinte. The snow\r\nwas as hard as a rock, And so slippery that there were a good many\r\ntumbles, but no serious injuries.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to state that the court of the fort was completely filled\r\nup. The roof of the house alone appeared above the white mass, the\r\nsurface of which had been worn smooth by the action of the wind; of the\r\npalisade nothing was visible but the top of the stakes, and the least\r\nnimble of the wild animals they dreaded could easily have climbed over\r\nthem. But what was to be done? It was no use to think of clearing away a\r\nmass of frozen snow ten feet thick, extending over so large an extent of\r\nground. All they could attempt would be to dig away the ice inside the\r\nenceinte, so as to form a kind of moat, the counterscarp of which would\r\nprotect the palisade. But alas the winter was only beginning, and a\r\nfresh tempest might at any time fill in the ditch a few hours.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Lieutenant was examining the works, which could no more\r\nprotect his fort than a single sunbeam could melt the solid layer of\r\nsnow,-Mrs Joliffe suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our dogs! our reindeer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed time to think about the poor animals. The dog house and\r\nstable being lower than the house were probably entirely covered, and\r\nthe supply of air had perhaps been completely cut off. Some hurried to\r\nthe dog-house, others to the reindeer stable, and all fears were quickly\r\ndispelled. The wall of ice, which connected the northern corner of the\r\nhouse with the cliff, had partly protected the two buildings, and the\r\nsnow round them was not more than four feet thick, so that the apertures\r\nleft in the walls had not been closed up. The animals were all well, and\r\nwhen the door was opened, the dogs rushed out barking with delight.\r\n\r\nThe cold was so intense, that after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s walk every one began to\r\nthink of the glowing stove in the large room at home. There was nothing\r\nleft to be done outside, the traps buried beneath ten feet of snow could\r\nnot be visited, so all returned to the house, the window, was closed,\r\nand the party sat down to the dinner awaiting them with sharpened\r\nappetites.\r\n\r\nWe can readily imagine that the conversation turned on the intensity\r\nof the cold, which had so rapidly converted the soft snow into a solid\r\nmass. It was no light matter, and might to a certain extent compromise\r\nthe safety of the little colony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9ccan we not count upon a few\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 thaw-will not all this snow be rapidly converted into water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9ca thaw at this time of year\r\nis not at all likely. Indeed I expect the thermometer will fall still\r\nlower, and it is very much to be regretted that we were unable to remove\r\nthe snow when it was soft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat, you think the temperature likely to become much colder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do most certainly, madam, 4\xc2\xb0 below zero-what is that at this\r\nlatitude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would it be if we were at the Pole itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pole, madam, is probably not the coldest point of the globe,\r\nfor most navigators agree that the sea is there open. From certain\r\npeculiarities of its geographical position it would appear that a\r\ncertain spot on the shores of North Georgia, 95\xc2\xb0 longitude and 78\xc2\xb0\r\nlatitude, has the coldest mean temperature in the world: 2\xc2\xb0 below zero\r\nall the year round. It is, therefore, called the \xe2\x80\x98pole of cold.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are more than 8\xc2\xb0 further south than\r\nthat famous point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose we shall suffer as much at Cape Bathurst as\r\nwe might have done in North Georgia. I only tell you of the \xe2\x80\x98pole of\r\ncold,\xe2\x80\x99 that you may not confound it with the Pole properly so-called\r\nwhen the lowness of the temperature is discussed. Great cold has besides\r\nbeen experienced on other points of the globe. The difference is, that\r\nthe low temperature is not there maintained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what places do you allude?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cI assure\r\nyou I take the greatest interest in this matter of degrees of cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I can remember, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, Arctic\r\nexplorers state that at Melville Island the temperature fell to 61\xc2\xb0\r\nbelow zero, and at Port Felix to 65\xc2\xb0.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Melville Island and Port Felix are some degrees farther north\r\nlatitude than Cape Bathurst, are they not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam, but in a certain sense we may say that their latitude\r\nproves nothing. A combination of different atmospheric conditions is\r\nrequisite to produce intense cold. Local and other causes largely modify\r\nclimate. If I remember rightly in 1845 . . . Sergeant Long, you were at\r\nFort Reliance at that date?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, was it not in January of that year that the cold was so\r\nexcessive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes it was, I remember only too well that the thermometer marked 70\xc2\xb0\r\nbelow zero.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cat Fort Reliance, on the Great\r\nSlave Lake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cand that was at 65\xc2\xb0 north\r\nlatitude only, which is the same parallel as that of Christiania and St\r\nPetersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we must be prepared for everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, we must when we winter in Arctic countries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the 29th and 30th November, the cold did not decrease, and it\r\nwas necessary to keep up huge fires to prevent the freezing in all the\r\ncorners of the house of the moisture in the atmosphere. Fortunately\r\nthere was plenty of fuel, and it was not spared. A mean temperature of\r\n52\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit was maintained indoors in spite of the intensity of the\r\ncold without.\r\n\r\nThomas Black was so anxious to take stellar observations, now that the\r\nsky was so clear, that he braved the rigour of the outside temperature,\r\nhoping to be able to examine some of the magnificent constellations\r\ntwinkling on the zenith. But he was compelled to desist-his instruments\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cburnt\xe2\x80\x9d his hands! \xe2\x80\x9dBurnt\xe2\x80\x9c is the only word to express the\r\nsensation produced by touching a metallic body subjected to the\r\ninfluence of intense cold. Exactly similar results are produced by\r\nthe sudden introduction of heat into an animate body, and the sudden\r\nwithdrawal of the same from it, as the astronomer found to his cost when\r\nhe left the skin of his fingers on his instruments. He had to give up\r\ntaking observations.\r\n\r\nHowever, the heavens made him the best amends in their power by\r\ndisplaying the most beautiful and indescribable phenomena of a lunar\r\nhalo and an Aurora Borealis.\r\n\r\nThe lunar halo was a white corona with a pale red edge encircling the\r\nmoon. This luminous meteor was about forty-five degrees in diameter, and\r\nwas the result of the diffraction of the lunar rays through the small\r\nprismatic ice-crystals floating in the atmosphere. The queen of the\r\nnight shone with renewed splendour and heightened beauty from the centre\r\nof the luminous ring, the colour and consistency of which resembled the\r\nmilky transparent lunar rainbows which have been so often described by\r\nastronomers.\r\n\r\nFifteen hours later the heavens were lit up by a magnificent Aurora\r\nBorealis, the arch of which extended over more than a hundred\r\ngeographical degrees. The vertex of this arch was situated in the\r\nmagnetic meridian, and, as is often the case, the rays darted by\r\nthe luminous meteor were of all the colours of the rainbow, red\r\npredominating. Here and there. the stars seemed to be floating in blood.\r\nGlowing lines of throbbing colour spread from the dark segment on the\r\nhorizon, some of them passing the zenith and quenching the light of the\r\nmoon in their electric waves, which oscillated and trembled as if swept\r\nby a current of air.\r\n\r\nNo description could give an adequate idea of the glory which flushed\r\nthe northern sky, converting it into a vast dome of fire, but after\r\nthe magnificent spectacle had been enjoyed for about half an hour, it\r\nsuddenly disappeared-not fading gradually away after concentration of\r\nits rays, or a diminution of its splendour, but dying abruptly, as if an\r\ninvisible hand had cut off the supply of electricity which gave it life.\r\n\r\nIt was time it was over, for the sake of Thomas Black, for in another\r\nfive minutes he would have been frozen where he stood !\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. A NEIGHBOURLY VISIT. On the 2nd December; the intensity of\r\nthe cold decreased. The phenomena of the lunar halo and Aurora Borealis\r\nwere symptoms which a meteorologist would have been at no loss to\r\ninterpret. They implied the existence of a certain quantity of watery\r\nvapour in the atmosphere, and the barometer fell slightly, whilst the\r\nthermometer rose to 15\xc2\xb0 above zero.\r\n\r\nAlthough this temperature would have seemed very cold to the inhabitants\r\nof a temperate zone, it was easily endured by the colonists. The absence\r\nof wind made a great difference, and Hobson having noticed that the\r\nupper layers of snow were becoming softer, ordered his men to clear\r\nit away from the outer approaches of the enceinte. Mac-Nab and his\r\nsubordinates set to work zealously, and completed their task in a few\r\ndays. The traps were now uncovered and re-set. A good many footprints\r\nshowed that there were plenty of furred animals about the cape, and as\r\nthey could not get any other food, it was probable that the bait in the\r\nsnares would soon attract them. In accordance with the advice of Marbre\r\nthe hunter, a reindeer trap was constructed in the Esquimaux style. A\r\ntrench was dug twelve feet deep, and of a uniform width of ten feet. A\r\nsee-saw plank, which would rebound when lowered, was laid across it.\r\nA bait of herbs was placed at one end of the plank, and any animal\r\nventuring to take them, was inevitably flung to the bottom of the pit,\r\nand the plank immediately returning to its former position, would allow\r\nof the trapping of another animal in the same manner. Once in, there was\r\nno getting out. The only difficulty Marbre had to contend with in making\r\nhis trap, was the extreme hardness of the ground to be dug out, but both\r\nhe and the Lieutenant were not a little surprised at finding beneath\r\nsome five feet of earth and sand a bed of snow, as hard as a rock, which\r\nappeared to be very thick.\r\n\r\nAfter closely examining the geological structure of the ground, Hobson\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis part of the coast must have been subjected to intense cold for\r\na considerable length of time a great many years ago. Probably the\r\nice rests on a bed of granite, and the earth and sand upon it have\r\naccumulated gradually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, our trap won\xe2\x80\x99t be any the worse for that, the reindeer\r\nwill find a slippery wall, which it will be impossible for them to\r\nclimb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarbre was right, as the event proved.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th September, he and Sabine were on their way to the trench,\r\nwhen they heard loud growls. They stood still and listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no reindeer making that noise, \xe2\x80\x9csaid Marbre, \xe2\x80\x9cI know well\r\nenough what creature has fallen into our pit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bear?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sabine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marbre, whose eyes glistened with delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Sabine, \xe2\x80\x9cwe won\xe2\x80\x99t grumble at that, bears\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsteaks are as good as reindeers\xe2\x80\x99, and we get the fur in! Come\r\nalong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two hunters were armed. They quickly slipped balls into their\r\nguns, which were already loaded with lead, and hurried to the trap.\r\nThe see-saw plank had swung back into its place, but the bait had\r\ndisappeared, having probably been dragged down, into the trench. The\r\ngrowls became louder and fiercer, and looking down the hunters saw that\r\nit was indeed a bear they had taken. A huge mass was huddled together\r\nin one corner of the pit, looking in the gloom like a pile of white fur\r\nwith two glittering eyes. The sides of the trench had been ploughed up\r\nby the creature\xe2\x80\x99s sharp claws, and had they been made of earth instead\r\nof ice, it would certainly have managed to scramble out, but it could\r\nget no hold on the slippery surface, and it had only managed to enlarge\r\nits prison, not to escape from it.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances the capture was easy. Two balls carefully aimed\r\nput an end to the bear\xe2\x80\x99s life, and the next thing to do was to get it\r\nout of the pit. The two hunters returned to the fort for reinforcements,\r\nand ten of the soldiers, provided with ropes, returned with them. It was\r\nnot without considerable difficulty that the body was hauled up. It was\r\na huge creature, six feet long, weighing six hundred pounds, and must\r\nhave possessed immense strength. It belonged to the sub-order of white\r\nbears, and had the flattened head, long neck, short and slightly\r\ncurved claws, narrow muzzle, and smooth white fur characteristic of the\r\nspecies. The edible portions of this valuable animal were confided to\r\nMrs Joliffe, and by her carefully prepared for the table.\r\n\r\nThe next week the traps were in full activity. Some twenty martens were\r\ntaken, in all the beauty of their winter clothing, but only two or three\r\nfoxes. These cunning creatures divined the snare laid for them, and\r\nscratching up the ground near the trap, they often managed to run off\r\nwith the bait without being caught. This made Sabine beside himself\r\nwith rage "for,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a subterfuge was unworthy of a\r\nrespectable fox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout the 10th December, the wind having veered round to the south-west,\r\nthe snow again began to fall, but not in thick flakes, or in large\r\nquantities. The wind being high, however, the cold was severely felt,\r\nand it was necessary to settle in-doors again, and resume domestic\r\noccupations. Hobson distributed lime lozenges and lime juice to every\r\none as a precaution against the scorbutic affections, which damp cold\r\nproduces. No symptoms of scurvy had fortunately as yet appeared amongst\r\nthe occupants of the fort, thanks to the sanitary precautions taken.\r\n\r\nThe winter solstice was now approaching, when the darkness of the Polar\r\nnight would be most profound, as the sun would be at the lowest maximum\r\npoint below the horizon of the northern hemisphere. At midnight the\r\nsouthern edges of the long white plains were touched with a faint\r\nglimmer of twilight, that was all, and it would be impossible to imagine\r\nanything more melancholy than the gloomy stillness and darkness of the\r\nvast expanse.\r\n\r\nHobson felt more secure from the attacks of wild beasts, now that\r\nthe approaches to the enceinte had been cleared of snow, which was a\r\nfortunate circumstance, as ominous growlings were heard, the nature of\r\nwhich no one could mistake.\r\n\r\nThere was no fear of visits from Indian hunters or Canadians at this\r\ntime of year, but an incident occurred proving that these districts were\r\nnot altogether depopulated even in the winter, and which was quite an\r\nepisode in the long dreary dark months. Some human beings still lingered\r\non the coast hunting morses and camping under the snow. They belonged\r\nto the race of Esquimaux, "or eaters of raw flesh,\xe2\x80\x9d which is scattered\r\nover the continent of North America, from Baffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bay to Behring\r\nStrait, seldom, however, advancing farther south than the Great Slave\r\nLake.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th December, or rather nine hours before midday,\r\nSergeant Long, on his return from an excursion along the coast, ended\r\nhis report to the Lieutenant by saying, that if his eyes had not\r\ndeceived him, a tribe of nomads were encamped about four miles from the\r\nfort, near a little cape jutting out from the coast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you suppose these nomads are?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither men or morses,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nmedium!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brave Sergeant would have been considerably surprised if any one had\r\ntold him that some naturalists admit the existence of the \xe2\x80\x9c medium,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe idea of which he scouted; and certain savants have with some humour\r\nclassed the Esquimaux as an \xe2\x80\x9c intermediate species \xe2\x80\x9c between roan\r\nand the sea-cow.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson, Mrs Barnett, Madge, and a few others at once went\r\nto ascertain the truth of the report. Well wrapt up, and on their guard\r\nagainst a sudden chill, their feet cased in furred boots, and guns and\r\nhatchets in their hands, they issued from the postern, and made their\r\nway over the frozen snow along the coast, strewn with masses of ice.\r\n\r\nThe moon, already in the last quarter, shed a few faint rays through the\r\nmists which shrouded the ice-fields. After marching for about an hour,\r\nthe Lieutenant began to think that the Sergeant had been mistaken, and\r\nthat what he had seen were morses, who had returned to their native\r\nelement through the holes in the ice which they always keep open.\r\n\r\nBut Long, pointing to a grey wreath of smoke curling out of a conical\r\nprotuberance on the ice-field some hundred steps off, contented himself\r\nwith observing quietly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe morses are smoking, then !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke some living creatures came out of the but dragging\r\nthemselves along the snow. They were Esquimaux, but whether male or\r\nfemale none but a native could have said, for their costumes were all\r\nexactly alike.\r\n\r\nIndeed, without in the least sharing the opinion of the naturalist\r\nquoted above, any one might have taken the rough shaggy figures for\r\nseals or some other amphibious animals. There were six of them-four\r\nfull-grown, and two children. Although very short, they were\r\nbroad-chested and muscular. They had the flat noses, long eye-lashes,\r\nlarge mouths, thick lips, long black coarse hair, and beardless chins of\r\ntheir race. Their costume consisted of a round coat made of the skin of\r\nthe walrus, a hood, boots, trousers, and mittens of the same material.\r\nThey gazed at the Europeans in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes any one understand Esquimaux?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nNo one was acquainted with that idiom, and every one started when a\r\nvoice immediately exclaimed in English, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome! welcome !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an Esquimaux, and, as they learned later, a woman, who,\r\napproaching Mrs Barnett, held out her hand.\r\n\r\nThe lady, much surprised, replied in a few words, which the native\r\ngirl readily understood, and the whole family was invited to follow the\r\nEuropeans to the fort.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux looked searchingly at the strangers, and after a few\r\nmoments\xe2\x80\x99 hesitation they accompanied the Lieutenant, keeping close\r\ntogether, however:\r\n\r\nArrived at the enceinte, the native woman, seeing the house, of the\r\nexistence of which she had had no idea, exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHouse! snow-house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked if it were made of snow, which was a natural question enough,\r\nfor the house was all but hidden beneath the white mass which covered\r\nthe ground. She was made to understand that it was built of wood; she\r\nthen turned and said a few words to her companions, who made signs of\r\nacquiescence, and they all passed through the postern, and were taken to\r\nthe large room in the chief building.\r\n\r\nThey removed their hoods, and it became possible to distinguish sexes.\r\nThere were two men, about forty or fifty years old, with yellowish-red\r\ncomplexions, sharp teeth, and projecting cheek-bones, which gave them\r\nsomething of the appearance of carnivorous animals; two women, still\r\nyoung whose matted hair was adorned with the teeth and claws of Polar\r\nbears; and two children, about five or six years old, poor little\r\ncreatures with intelligent faces, who looked about them with wide\r\nwondering eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe the Esquimaux are always hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cso I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose our guests would object to a slice of venison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s order, Joliffe brought some\r\nreindeer-venison, which the poor creatures devoured with greedy avidity;\r\nbut the young woman who had answered in English behaved with greater\r\nrefinement, and watched Mrs Barnett and the women of the fort without\r\nonce removing her eyes from them. Presently noticing the baby in Mrs\r\nMac-Nabs arms; she rose and ran up to it, speaking to it in a soft\r\nvoice, and caressing it tenderly.\r\n\r\nIndeed if not exactly superior, the young girl was certainly more\r\ncivilised than her companions, which was especially noticeable when,\r\nbeing attacked by a slight fit of coughing, she put her hand before her\r\nmouth in the manner enjoined by the first rules of civilised society.\r\n\r\nThis significant gesture did not escape any one, and Mrs Barnett, who\r\nchatted for some time with the Esquimaux woman, learned from her in a\r\nfew short sentences that she had been for a year in the service of the\r\nDanish governor of Upper Navik, whose wife was English, and that she had\r\nleft Greenland to follow her family to the hunting grounds. The two men\r\nwere her brothers; the other woman was her sister-in-law, married to one\r\nof the men, and mother of the two children. They were all returning\r\nfrom Melbourne Island, on the eastern coast of English America, and were\r\nmaking for Point Barrow, on the western coast of Russian America, the\r\nhome of their tribe, and- were considerably astonished to find a factory\r\nestablished on Cape Bathurst. Indeed the two men shook their heads when\r\nthey spoke of it. Did they disapprove of the construction of a fort\r\nat this particular point of the coast? Did they think the situation\r\nill-chosen? In spite of all his endeavours, Hobson could get no\r\nsatisfactory reply to these questions, or rather he could not understand\r\nthe answers he received.\r\n\r\nThe name of the young girl was Kalumah, and she seemed to have taken\r\na great fancy to Mrs Barnett. But sociable as she was, she appeared to\r\nfeel no regret at having left the governor of Upper Navik, and to be\r\nsincerely attached to her relations.\r\n\r\nAfter refreshing themselves with the reindeer-venison, and drinking\r\nhalf-a-pint of rum, in which the children had their share, the Esquimaux\r\ntook leave of their hosts; but before saying goodbye, the young girl\r\ninvited Mrs Barnett to visit their snow-hut, and the lady promised to do\r\nso the next day, weather permitting.\r\n\r\nThe next day was fine, and accompanied by Madge, Lieutenant Hobson, and\r\na few soldiers, well armed in case any bears should be prowling about,\r\nMrs Barnett set out for \xe2\x80\x9c Cape Esquimaux,\xe2\x80\x9d as they had named the\r\nspot where the little colony had encamped.\r\n\r\nKalumah hastened forward to meet her friend of yesterday, and pointed\r\nto the but with an, air of pride. It was a large cone of snow, with an\r\nopening in the summit, through which the smoke from the fire inside\r\nmade its way. These snow-houses, called igloos in the language of the\r\nEsquimaux, are constructed with great rapidity, and are admirably suited\r\nto the climate. In them their owners can endure a temperature 40\xc2\xb0\r\nbelow zero, without fires, and without suffering much. In the summer\r\nthe Esquimaux encamp in tents made of seal and reindeer skins, which are\r\ncalled tupics.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to get into this hut. The only opening was a hole\r\nclose to the ground, and it was necessary to creep through a kind of\r\npassage three or four feet long, which is about the thickness of the\r\nwalls of these snow-houses. But a traveller by profession, a laureate of\r\nthe Royal Society, could not hesitate, and Mrs Paulina Barnett did not\r\nhesitate! Followed by Madge, she bravely entered the narrow tunnel in\r\nimitation of her guide. Lieutenant Hobson and his men dispensed with\r\npaying their respects inside.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs Barnett soon discovered that the chief difficulty was not\r\ngetting into the but, but remaining in it when there. The room was\r\nheated by a fire, on which the bones of morses were burning; and the air\r\nwas full of the smell of the fetid oil of a lamp, of greasy garments,\r\nand the flesh of the amphibious animals which form the chief article of\r\nan Esquimaux\xe2\x80\x99s diet. It was suffocating and sickening! Madge could not\r\nstand it, and hurried out at once, but Mrs Barnett, rather than hurt the\r\nfeelings of the young native, showed superhuman courage, and extended\r\nher visit over five long minutes!-five centuries! The two children and\r\ntheir mother were at home, but the men had gone to hunt morses four or\r\nfive miles from their camp.\r\n\r\nOnce out of the hut, Mrs Barnett drew a long sigh of relief, and the\r\ncolour returned to her blanched cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of\r\nEsquimaux houses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ventilation leaves something to be desired !\xe2\x80\x9d she replied\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\nThe interesting native family remained encamped near Cape Esquimaux for\r\neight days. The men passed twelve hours out of every twenty-four hunting\r\nmorses. With a patience which none but sportsmen could understand, they\r\nwould watch for the amphibious animals near the holes through which\r\nthey come up to the surface of the ice-field to breathe. When the morse\r\nappears, a rope with a running noose is flung round its body a little\r\nbelow the head, and it is dragged on to the ice-field, often with\r\nconsiderable difficulty, and killed with hatchets. It is really more\r\nlike fishing than hunting. It is considered a great treat to drink\r\nthe warm blood of the walrus, and the Esquimaux often indulge in it to\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\nKalumah came to the fort every day in spite of the severity of the\r\nweather. She was never tired of going through the different rooms, and\r\nwatching Mrs Joliffe at her cooking or sewing. She asked the English\r\nname of everything, and talked for hours together with Mrs Barnett, if\r\nthe term \xe2\x80\x9ctalking\xe2\x80\x9d can be applied to an exchange of words after\r\nlong deliberation on both sides. When Mrs Barnett read aloud, Kalumah\r\nlistened with great attention, although she probably understood nothing\r\nof what she heard.\r\n\r\nThe young native girl had a sweet voice, and sometimes sang some strange\r\nmelancholy rhythmical songs with a peculiar metre, and, if we may so\r\nexpress it, a frosty ring about them, peculiarly characteristic of their\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett had the patience to translate one of these Greenland sagas,\r\nwhich was sung to a sad air, interspersed with long pauses, and filled\r\nwith strange intervals, which produced an indescribable effect. We give\r\nan English rendering of Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s translation, which may give a\r\nfaint idea of this strange hyperborean poetry.\r\n\r\nGREENLAND SONG Dark Is the sky, The sun sinks wearily; My trembling\r\nheart, with sorrow filled, Aches drearily ! My sweet child at my songs\r\nis smiling still, While at his tender heart the icicles lie chill. Child\r\nof my dreams I Thy love doth cheer me; The cruel biting frost I brave\r\nBut to be near thee! Ah me, Ah me, could these hot tears of mine But\r\nmelt the icicles around that heart of thine! Could we once more Meet\r\nheart to heart, Thy little hands close clasped in mine, No more to part.\r\nThen on thy chill heart rays from heaven above Should fall, and softly\r\nmelt it with the warmth of love! On the 20th December the Esquimaux\r\nfamily came to take leave of the occupants of the fort. Kalumah was\r\nsorry to part with Mrs Barnett, who would gladly have retained her in\r\nher service, but the young native could not be persuaded to leave her\r\nown people; she promised, however, to return to Fort Hope in the summer.\r\n\r\nHer farewell was touching. She presented Mrs Barnett with a copper\r\nring, and received in exchange a necklace of black beads, which\r\nshe immediately put on. Hobson gave the poor people a good stock of\r\nprovisions, which they packed in their sledge; and after a few words of\r\ngrateful acknowledgment from Kalumah, the whole party set out towards\r\nthe west, quickly disappearing in the thick fogs on the shore.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. MERCURY FREEZES. A few days of dry calm weather favoured the\r\noperations of the hunters, but they did not venture far from the fort;\r\nthe abundance of game rendered it unnecessary to do so, and Lieutenant\r\nHobson could justly congratulate himself on having chosen so favourable\r\na situation for the new settlement. A great number of furred animals of\r\nall kinds were taken in the traps, and Sabine and Marbre killed a good\r\nmany Polar hares. Some twenty starving wolves were shot. Hunger rendered\r\nthe latter animals aggressive, and bands of them gathered about the\r\nfort, filling the air with hoarse howls, and amongst the \xe2\x80\x9c hummocks\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c on the ice-fields sometimes prowled huge bears, whose movements were\r\nwatched with great interest.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th December all excursions had again to be given up. The wind\r\nveered suddenly to the north, and the cold became exceedingly severe.\r\nIt was impossible to remain out of doors without being frost-bitten. The\r\nFahrenheit thermometer fell to 18\xc2\xb0 below zero, and the gale roared like\r\na volley of musketry. Hobson took care to provide the animals with food\r\nenough to last several weeks.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day, the day of home-gatherings so dear to the heart of all\r\nEnglishmen, was kept with due solemnity. The colonists returned thanks\r\nto God for preserving them through so many perils; and the workmen,\r\nwho had a holiday in honour of the day, afterwards assembled with their\r\nmasters and the ladies round a well-filled board, on which figured two\r\nhuge Christmas puddings.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a huge bowl of punch flamed in the centre of the table;\r\nthe lamps were put out, and for a time the room was lighted only by\r\nthe livid flames of the spirit, the familiar objects assuming strange\r\nfantastic forms. The spirits of the soldiers rose as they watched the\r\nflickering illumination, and their excitement was not lessened after\r\nimbibing some of the burning liquid.\r\n\r\nBut now the flames began to pale; bluish tongues still fitfully licked\r\nthe plump sides of the national pudding for a few minutes, and then died\r\naway.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, although the lamps had not been relit, the room did\r\nnot become dark on the extinction of the flames. A bright red light was\r\nstreaming through the window, which had passed unnoticed in the previous\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nThe revellers started to their feet, and looked at each other in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fire !\xe2\x80\x9d cried several.\r\n\r\nBut unless the house itself were burning, there could not be a fire\r\nanywhere near Cape Bathurst.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant rushed to the window, and at once understood the cause of\r\nthe phenomenon. It was an eruption.\r\n\r\nIndeed, above the western cliffs beyond Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay the horizon\r\nwas on fire. The summits of the igneous hills, some miles from Cape\r\nBathurst, could not be seen; but the sheaf of flame shot up to a\r\nconsiderable height, lighting up the whole country in a weird, unearthly\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is more beautiful than the Aurora Borealis!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs\r\nBarnett.\r\n\r\nThomas Black indignantly protested against this assertion. A terrestrial\r\nphenomenon more beautiful than a meteor! But no one was disposed to\r\nargue with him about it, for all hurried out, in spite of the bitter\r\ngale and biting cold, to watch the glorious spectacle of the flashing\r\nsheaf of flames standing out against the black background of the night\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nHad not the mouths and ears of the party been cased in furs, they would\r\nhave been able to hear the rumbling noise of the eruption, and to tell\r\neach other of the impressions made upon them by this magnificent sight;\r\nbut, as it was, they could neither speak nor hear. They might well be\r\ncontent, however, with gazing upon such a glorious scene-a scene which\r\nonce looked upon could never be forgotten. The glowing sheets of\r\nflames contrasted alike with the gloomy darkness of the heavens and the\r\ndazzling whiteness of the far-stretching carpet of snow, and produced\r\neffects of light and shade which no pen or pencil could adequately\r\nportray. The throbbing reverberations spread beyond the zenith,\r\ngradually quenching the light of all the stars. The white ground became\r\ndashed with golden tints, the hummocks on the ice-field and the huge\r\nicebergs in the background reflecting the glimmering colours like\r\nso many glowing mirrors. The rays of light, striking on the edges or\r\nsurfaces of the ice, became bent and diffracted; the angles and varying\r\ninclinations on which they fell fretting them into fringes of colour,\r\nand reflecting them back with changed and heightened beauty. It was like\r\na fairy scene in which ice and snow combined to add \xc3\xa9clat to a m\xc3\xaalee\r\nof rays in which luminous waves rushed upon each other, breaking into\r\ncoloured ripples.\r\n\r\nBut the excessive cold soon drove the admiring spectators back to their\r\nwarm dwelling, and many a nose paid dearly for the feast enjoyed by the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nDuring the following days the cold became doubly severe. The mercurial\r\nthermometer was of course no longer of any use for marking degrees, and\r\nan alcohol thermometer had to be used. On the night of the 28th to the\r\n29th December the column fell to 32\xc2\xb0 below zero.\r\n\r\nThe stoves were piled up with fuel, but the temperature in the\r\nhouse could not be maintained above 20\xc2\xb0 degrees. The bedrooms were\r\nexceedingly cold, and ten feet from the stove, in the large room, its\r\nheat could not be felt at all. The little baby had the warmest corner,\r\nand its cradle was rocked in turn by those who came to the fire. Opening\r\ndoors or windows was strictly forbidden, as the vapour in the rooms\r\nwould immediately have been converted into snow, and in the passage the\r\nbreathing of the inmates already produced that result. Every now and\r\nthen dull reports were heard, which startled those unaccustomed to\r\nliving in such high latitudes. They were caused by the cracking of the\r\ntrunks of trees, of which the walls were composed under the influence of\r\nthe intense cold. The stock of rum and gin stowed away in the garret had\r\nto be brought down into the sitting-room, as the alcohol was freezing\r\nand sinking to the bottom of the bottles. The spruce-beer made from a\r\ndecoction of young fir-branchlets burst the barrels in which it was kept\r\nas it froze, whilst all solid bodies resisted the introduction of\r\nheat as if they were petrified. Wood burnt very slowly, and Hobson was\r\nobliged to sacrifice some of the walrus-oil to quicken its combustion.\r\nFortunately the chimneys drew well, so that there was no disagreeable\r\nsmell inside, although for a long distance outside the air was\r\nimpregnated with the fetid odour of the smoke from Fort Hope, which a\r\ncasual observer might therefore have pronounced an unhealthy building.\r\n\r\nOne symptom we must notice was the great thirst from which every one\r\nsuffered. To relieve it, different liquids had to be melted at the fire,\r\nfor it- would have been dangerous to eat ice. Another effect of the cold\r\nwas intense drowsiness, which Hobson earnestly entreated his companions\r\nto resist. Some appeared unable to do so; but Mrs Barnett was invaluable\r\nin setting an example of constant activity: always brave, she kept\r\nherself awake, and encouraged others by her kindness, brightness, and\r\nsympathy. Sometimes she read aloud accounts of travels, or sang some old\r\nfamiliar English song, in the chorus of which all joined. These joyous\r\nstrains roused up the sleepers whether they would or no, and their\r\nvoices soon swelled the chorus. The long days of imprisonment passed\r\nwearily by, and the Lieutenant, consulting the outside thermometer\r\nthrough the windows, announced that the cold was still on the increase.\r\nOn the 31st December, the mercury was all frozen hard in the cistern of\r\nthe instrument, so that the temperature was 44\xc2\xb0 below freezing point.\r\n\r\nThe next day, 1st January 1860, Lieutenant Hobson wished Mrs Barnett a\r\nhappy new year, and complimented her on the courage and good temper with\r\nwhich she endured the miseries of this northern winter. The astronomer\r\nwas not forgotten in the universal interchange of good wishes amongst\r\nthe members of the little colony; but his only thought on entering\r\nanother year was, that it was the beginning of that in which the great\r\neclipse was to take place. Fortunately the general health still remained\r\ngood, and any symptoms of scurvy were promptly checked by the use of\r\nlime-juice and lime-lozenges.\r\n\r\nIt would not do, however, to rejoice too soon. The winter had still to\r\nlast three months. The sun would doubtless reappear above the horizon in\r\ndue time; but there was no reason to think that the cold had reached its\r\nmaximum intensity, especially as in most northern countries February is\r\nthe month during which the temperature falls lowest. However that might\r\nbe, there was no decrease in the severity of the weather during\r\nthe first days of the new year, and on the 8th January the alcohol\r\nthermometer placed outside the window of the passage marked 66\xc2\xb0 below\r\nzero. A few degrees more and the minimum temperature at Fort Reliance in\r\n1835 would be reached!\r\n\r\nJaspar Hobson grew more and more uneasy at the continued severity of the\r\ncold. He began to fear that the furred animals would have to seek a less\r\nrigorous climate further south, which would of course thwart all his\r\nplans for hunting in the early spring. Moreover, he sometimes heard\r\nsubterranean rumblings, which were evidently connected with the volcanic\r\neruption. The western horizon still glowed with the reflection of the\r\nburning lava, and it was evident that some great convulsion was going\r\non in the bowels of the earth. Might not the close vicinity of an active\r\nvolcano be dangerous to the new fort ? Such was the question which the\r\nsubterranean rumblings forced upon the mind of the Lieutenant, but he\r\nkept his vague apprehensions to himself.\r\n\r\nOf course under these circumstances no one dreamt of leaving the house.\r\nThe animals were well provided for, and being accustomed to long fasts\r\nin the winter, required no attention from their masters, so that there\r\nreally was no necessity for any exposure out of doors. It was difficult\r\nenough to endure the inside temperature, even with the help of a\r\nplentiful combustion of wood and oil; for, in spite of every precaution,\r\ndamp crept into the ill-ventilated rooms, and layers of ice, increasing\r\nin thickness every day, were formed upon the beams. The condensers were\r\nchoked up, and one of them burst from the pressure of the ice.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson did not spare his fuel; he was, in fact, rather lavish\r\nof it in his anxiety to raise the temperature, which, when the fires got\r\nlow-as of course sometimes happened-fell to 15\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit. The men on\r\nguard, who relieved each other every hour, had strict orders to keep up\r\nthe fires, and great was the dismay of the Lieutenant when Sergeant Long\r\nsaid to him one day\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be out of wood soon !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of wood !\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean our stock is getting low, and we must lay in fresh stores\r\nsoon. Of course I know, though, that it will be at the risk of his life\r\nthat any one goes out in this cold !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake not to build the wooden\r\nshed close to the house, and to make no direct communication with it. I\r\nsee that now it is too late. I ought not to have forgotten that we\r\nwere going to winter beyond the seventieth parallel. But what\xe2\x80\x99s done\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be undone. How long will the wood last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is enough to feed the furnace and stove for another two or\r\nthree days,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hope by that time that the severity of the cold may have\r\ndecreased, and that we may venture across the court of the fort without\r\ndanger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe atmosphere\r\nis very clear, the wind is still in the north, and I shall not be\r\nsurprised if this temperature is maintained. for another fifteen\r\ndays-until the new moon, in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my brave fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cwe won\xe2\x80\x99t die of\r\ncold if we can help it, and the day we have to brave the outside air \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will brave it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long.\r\n\r\nHobson pressed his subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s hand, well knowing the poor\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s devotion.\r\n\r\nWe might fancy that Hobson and the Sergeant were exaggerating when they\r\nalluded to fatal results from sudden exposure to the open air, but they\r\nspoke from experience, gained from long residence in the rigorous Polar\r\nregions. They had seen strong men fall fainting on the ice under similar\r\ncircumstances; their breath failed them, and they were taken up in a\r\nstate of suffocation. Incredible as such facts may appear, they have\r\nbeen of frequent occurrence amongst those who have wintered in the\r\nextreme north. In their journey along the shores of Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay in\r\n1746, Moor and Smith saw many incidents of this kind,-some of their\r\ncompanions were killed, struck down by the cold, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that sudden death may result from braving a temperature in which\r\nmercury freezes.\r\n\r\nSuch was the distressing state of things at Fort Hope, when a new danger\r\narose to aggravate the sufferings of the colonists.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. THE LARGE POLAR BEARS. The only one of the four windows\r\nthrough which it was possible to look into the court of the fort was\r\nthat opening at the end of the entrance passage. The outside shutters\r\nhad not been closed; but before it could be seen through it had to\r\nbe washed with boiling water, as the panes were covered with a thick\r\ncoating of ice. This was done several times a day by the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norders, when the districts surrounding the fort were carefully examined,\r\nand the state of the sky, and of the alcohol thermometer placed outside,\r\nwere accurately noted.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th January, towards eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, Kellet,\r\nwhose turn it was to look out, suddenly called the Sergeant, and\r\npointed to some moving masses indistinctly visible in the gloom. Long,\r\napproaching the window observed quietly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are bears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact half-a-dozen of these formidable animals had succeeded in\r\ngetting over the palisades, and, attracted by the smoke from the\r\nchimneys, were advancing upon the house.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the approach of the bears, Hobson at once ordered\r\nthe window of the passage to be barricaded inside; it was the only\r\nunprotected opening in the house, and when it was secured it appeared\r\nimpossible for the bears to effect an entrance. The window was,\r\ntherefore, quickly closed up with bars, which the carpenter Mac-Nab\r\nwedged firmly in, leaving a narrow slit through which to watch the\r\nmovements of the unwelcome visitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the head carpenter, \xe2\x80\x9cthese gentlemen can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nin without our permission, and we have time to hold a council of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing has been\r\nwanting to our northern winter! After the cold come the bears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot after,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, which is a serious\r\nmatter, with the cold, and a cold ago intense that we cannot venture\r\noutside! I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we shall get rid .of these tiresome\r\nbrutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they will soon get tired of prowling about,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlady, \xe2\x80\x9cand return as they came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson shook his head as if he had his doubts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know these animals, madam. They are famished with hunger,\r\nand will not go until we make them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you anxious, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes and no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the bears\r\nwill get in; but neither do I see how we can get out, should it become\r\nnecessary for us to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words Hobson turned to the window, and Mrs Barnett joined the\r\nother women, who had gathered round the Sergeant, and were listening to\r\nwhat he had to say about the bears. He spoke like a man well up in\r\nhis subject, for he had had many an encounter with these formidable\r\ncarnivorous creatures, which are often met with even towards the south,\r\nwhere, however, they can be safely attacked, whilst here the siege would\r\nbe a regular blockade, for the cold would quite prevent any attempt at a\r\nsortie.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole day the movements of the bears were attentively\r\nwatched. Every now and then one of them would lay his great head against\r\nthe window-pane and an ominous growl was heard.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant and the Sergeant took counsel together, and it was agreed\r\nthat if their enemies showed no sign of beating a retreat, they would\r\ndrill a few loopholes in the walls of the house, and fire at them. But\r\nit was decided to put off this desperate measure for a day or two, as\r\nit was desirable to avoid giving access to the outer air; the inside\r\ntemperature being already far too low. The walrus oil to be burnt was\r\nfrozen so hard that it had to be broken up with hatchets.\r\n\r\nThe day passed without any incident. The bears went and came, prowling\r\nround the house, but attempting no direct attack. Watch was kept all\r\nnight, and at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning they seemed to have left the\r\ncourt-at any rate, they were nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nBut about seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Marbre went up to the loft to fetch some\r\nprovisions, and on his return announced that the bears were walking\r\nabout on the roof.\r\n\r\nHobson, the Sergeant, Mac-Nab, and two or three soldiers seized their\r\narms, and rushed to the ladder in the passage, which. communicated with\r\nthe loft by a trap-door. The cold was, however, so intense in the loft\r\nthat the men could not hold the barrels of their guns, and their breath\r\nfroze as it left their lips and floated about them as snow.\r\n\r\nMarbre was right; the bears were all on the roof, and the sound of\r\ntheir feet and their growls could be distinctly heard. Their great claws\r\ncaught in the laths of the roof beneath the ice, and there was some\r\ndanger that they might have sufficient strength to tear away the\r\nwoodwork.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant and his men, becoming giddy and faint from the intense\r\ncold, were soon obliged to go down, and Hobson announced the state of\r\naffairs in as hopeful a tone as he could assume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bears,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9care now upon the roof. We ourselves have\r\nnothing to fear, as they can\xe2\x80\x99t get into our rooms; but they may force\r\nan entrance to the loft, and devour the furs stowed away there. Now\r\nthese furs belong to the Company, and it is our duty to preserve them\r\nfrom injury I ask you then, my friends, to aid me in removing them to a\r\nplace of safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eagerly volunteered, and relieving each other in parties of two or\r\nthree, for none could have supported the intense severity of the cold\r\nfor long at a time, they managed to carry all the furs into the large\r\nroom in about an hour.\r\n\r\nWhilst the work was proceeding, the bears continued their efforts to get\r\nin, and tried to lift up the rafters of .the roof. In some places the\r\nlaths became broken by their weight, and poor Mac-Nab was in despair; he\r\nhad not reckoned upon such a contingency when he constructed the roof,\r\nand expected to see it give way every moment.\r\n\r\nThe day passed, however, without any change in the situation. The bears\r\ndid not get in; but a no less formidable enemy, the cold, gradually\r\npenetrated into every room. The fires in the stoves burnt low; the fuel\r\nin reserve was almost exhausted; and before twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the last\r\npiece of wood would be burnt, and the genial warmth of the stove would\r\nno longer cheer the unhappy colonists.\r\n\r\nDeath would then await them-death in its most fearful form, from cold.\r\nThe poor creatures, huddled together round the stove, felt that their\r\nown vital heat must soon become exhausted, but not a word of complaint\r\npassed their lips. The women bore their sufferings with the greatest\r\nheroism, and Mrs Mac-Nab pressed her baby convulsively to her ice-cold\r\nbreast. Some of the soldiers slept, or rather were wrapped in a heavy\r\ntorpor, which could scarcely be called sleep.\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning Hobson consulted the thermometer\r\nhanging in the large room, about ten feet from the stove.\r\n\r\nIt marked 4\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit below zero.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant pressed his hand to his forehead, and looked mournfully\r\nat his silent companions without a word. His half-condensed breath\r\nshrouded his face in a white cloud, and he was standing rooted to the\r\nspot when a hand was laid upon his shoulder. He started, and looked\r\nround to see Mrs Barnett beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething must be done, Lieutenant Hobson !\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nenergetic woman; \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot die like this without an effort to save\r\nourselves !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, feeling revived by the moral courage\r\nof his companion--\xe2\x80\x9d yes, something must be done !\xe2\x80\x9d and he called\r\ntogether Long, Mac-Nab, and Rae the blacksmith, as the bravest men in\r\nhis party. All, together with Mrs Barnett, hastened to the window,\r\nand having washed the panes with boiling water, they consulted the\r\nthermometer outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy-two degrees !\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friends, two courses\r\nonly are open to us, we can risk our lives to get a fresh supply of\r\nfuel, or we can burn the benches, beds, partition walls, and everything\r\nin the house to feed our stoves for a few days longer. A desperate\r\nalternative, for the cold may last for some time yet; there is no sign\r\nof a change in the weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us risk our lives to get fuel !\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Long.\r\n\r\nAll agreed that it would be the best course, and without another word\r\neach one set to work to prepare for the emergency.\r\n\r\nThe following were the precautions taken to save the lives of those who\r\nwere about to risk themselves for the sake of the general good :\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe shed in which the wood was stored was about fifty steps on the left,\r\nbehind, the principal house. It was decided that one of the men should\r\ntry and run to the shed. He was to take one rope wound round his body,\r\nand to carry another in his hand, one end of which was to be held by\r\none of his comrades. Once at the shed, he was to load one of the sledges\r\nthere with fuel, and tie one rope to the front, and the other to the\r\nback of the vehicle, so that it could be dragged backwards and forwards\r\nbetween the house and the shed without much danger. A tug violently\r\nshaking one or the other cord would be the signal that the sledge was\r\nfilled with fuel at the shed, or unloaded at the house.\r\n\r\nA very clever plan, certainly; but two things might defeat it. The\r\ndoor of the shed might be so blocked up with ice that it would be very\r\ndifficult to open it, or the bears might come down from the roof and\r\nprowl about the court. Two risks to be run !\r\n\r\nLong, Mac-Nab, and Rae, all three volunteered for the perilous service;\r\nbut the Sergeant reminded the other two that they were married, and\r\ninsisted upon being the first to venture.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lieutenant expressed a wish to go himself, Mrs Barnett said\r\nearnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are our chief; you have no right to expose yourself.\r\nLet Sergeant Long go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson could not but realise that his office imposed caution, and being\r\ncalled upon to decide which of his companions should go, be chose the\r\nSergeant. Mrs Barnett pressed the brave man\xe2\x80\x99s hand with ill-concealed\r\nemotion; and the rest of the colonists, asleep or stupefied, knew\r\nnothing of the attempt about to be made to save their lives.\r\n\r\nTwo long ropes were got ready. The Sergeant wound one round his body\r\nabove the warm furs, worth some thousand pounds sterling, in which\r\nhe was encased, and tied the other to his belt, on which he hung a\r\ntinder-box and a loaded revolver. Just before starting he swallowed down\r\nhalf a glass of rum, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto insure a good load of wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson, Rae, and Mac-Nab accompanied the brave fellow through the\r\nkitchen, where the fire had just gone out, and into the passage. Rae\r\nclimbed up to the trap-door of the loft, and peeping through it, made\r\nsure that the bears were still on the roof. The moment for action had\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nOne door of the passage was open, and in spite of the thick furs in\r\nwhich they were wrapped, all felt chilled to the very marrow of their\r\nbones; and when the second door was pushed open, they recoiled for an\r\ninstant, panting for breath, whilst the moisture held in suspension in\r\nthe air of the passage covered the walls and the floor with fine snow.\r\n\r\nThe weather outside was extremely dry, and the stars shone with\r\nextraordinary brilliancy. Sergeant Long rushed out without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation, dragging the cord behind him, one end of which was held by\r\nhis companions; the outer door was pushed to, and Hobson, Mae-Nab, and\r\nRae went back to the passage and closed the second door, behind which\r\nthey waited. If Long did not return in a few minutes, they might\r\nconclude that his enterprise had succeeded, and that, safe in the shed,\r\nhe was loading the first train with fuel. Ten minutes at the most ought\r\nto suffice for this operation, if he had been able to get the door open.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sergeant was fairly off, Hobson and Mac-Nab walked together\r\ntowards the end of the passage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Rae had been watching the bears and the loft. It was so dark\r\nthat all hoped Long\xe2\x80\x99s movements would escape the notice of the hungry\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nTen minutes elapsed, and the three watchers went back to the narrow\r\nspace between the two doors, waiting for the signal to be given to drag\r\nin the sledge.\r\n\r\nFive minutes more. The cord remained motionless in their hands! Their\r\nanxiety can be imagined. It was a quarter of an hour since the Sergeant\r\nhad started, plenty of time for all he had to do, and he had given no\r\nsignal.\r\n\r\nHobson waited a few minutes longer, and then tightening his hold of the\r\nend of the rope, he made a sign to his companions to pull with him. If\r\nthe load of wood were not quite ready, the Sergeant could easily stop it\r\nfrom being dragged away.\r\n\r\nThe rope was pulled vigorously. A heavy object seemed to slide along the\r\nsnow. In a few moments it reached the outer door.\r\n\r\nIt was the body of the Sergeant, with the rope round his waist. Poor\r\nLong had never reached the shed. He had fallen fainting to the ground,\r\nand after twenty minutes\xe2\x80\x99 exposure to such a temperature there was\r\nlittle hope that he would revive.\r\n\r\nA cry of grief and despair burst from the lips of Mac-Nab and Rae. They\r\nlifted their unhappy comrade from the ground, and carried him into the\r\npassage; but as the Lieutenant was closing the outer door, something\r\npushed violently against it, and a horrible growl was heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson.\r\n\r\nMac-Nab and Rae rushed to their officer\xe2\x80\x99s assistance; but Mrs Barnett\r\nhad been beforehand with them and was struggling with all her strength\r\nto help Hobson to close the door. In vain; the monstrous brute, throwing\r\nthe whole weight of its body against it, would force its way into the\r\npassage in another moment.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett, whose presence of mind did not forsake her now, seized one\r\nof the pistols in the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s belt, and waiting quietly until\r\nthe animal shoved its head between the door and the wall, discharged the\r\ncontents into its open mouth.\r\n\r\nThe bear fell backwards, mortally wounded no doubt, and the door was\r\nshut and securely fastened.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Sergeant was then carried into the large room. But,\r\nalas! the fire was dying out. How was it possible to restore the vital\r\nheat with no means of obtaining warmth?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go\xe2\x80\x94I will go and fetch some wood !\xe2\x80\x9d cried the blacksmith\r\nRae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Rae, we will go together!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett, whose\r\ncourage was unabated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my friends, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cyou would fall victims to\r\nthe cold, or the bears, or both. Let us burn all there is to burn in the\r\nhouse, and leave the rest to God !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the poor half-frozen settlers rose and laid about them with their\r\nhatchets like madmen. Benches, tables, and partition walls were thrown\r\ndown, broken up, crushed to pieces, and piled up in the stove of the\r\nlarge room and kitchen furnace. Very soon good fires were burning, on\r\nwhich a few drops of walrus-oil were poured, so that the temperature of\r\nthe rooms quickly rose a dozen degrees.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to restore the Sergeant. He was rubbed with warm\r\nrum, and gradually the circulation of his blood was restored. The white\r\nblotches with which parts of his body were covered began to disappear;\r\nbut he had suffered dreadfully, and several hours elapsed before he\r\ncould articulate a word. He was laid in a warm bed, and Mrs Barnett and\r\nMadge watched by him until the next morning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hobson, Mac-Nab, and Rae consulted bow best to escape from\r\ntheir terrible situation. It was impossible to shut their eyes to the\r\nfact that in two days this fresh supply of fuel would be exhausted, and\r\nthen, if the cold continued, what would become of them all? The new moon\r\nhad risen forty-eight hours ago, and there was no sign of a change in\r\nthe weather! The north wind still swept the face of the country with its\r\nicy breath; the barometer remained at \xe2\x80\x9c fine dry weather; \xe2\x80\x9cand there\r\nwas not a vapour to be seen above the endless succession of ice-fields.\r\nThere was reason to fear that the intense cold would last a long time\r\nyet, but what was to be done? Would it do to try once more to get to\r\nthe wood-shed, when the bears had been roused by the shot, and rendered\r\ndoubly dangerous? Would it be possible to attack these dreadful\r\ncreatures in the open air I No, it would be madness, and certain death\r\nfor all!\r\n\r\nFortunately the temperature of the rooms had now become more bearable,\r\nand in the morning Mrs Joliffe served up a breakfast of hot meat and\r\ntea. Hot grog was served out, and the brave Sergeant was able to take\r\nhis share. The heat from the stoves warmed the bodies and reanimated the\r\ndrooping courage of the poor colonists, who were now ready to attack\r\nthe bears at a word from Hobson. But the Lieutenant, thinking the forces\r\nunequally matched, would not risk the attempt; and it appeared likely\r\nthat the day would pass without any incident worthy of note, when at\r\nabout three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon a great noise was heard on the\r\ntop of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are!\xe2\x80\x9d cried two or three soldiers, hastily arming\r\nthemselves with hatchets and pistols.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the bears had torn away one of the rafters of the\r\nroof, and got into the loft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet every one remain where he is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Lieutenant. \xe2\x80\x9cRae,\r\nthe trap !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith rushed into the passage, scaled the ladder, and shut and\r\nsecurely fastened the trap-door.\r\n\r\nA dreadful noise was now heard-growling, stamping of feet, and tearing\r\nof claws. It was doubtful whether the danger of the anxious listeners\r\nwas increased, or the reverse. Some were of opinion that if all the\r\nbears were in the loft, it would be easier to attack them. They would be\r\nless formidable in a narrow space, and there would not be the same\r\nrisk of suffocation from cold. Of course a conflict with such fierce\r\ncreatures must still. be very perilous, but it no longer appeared so\r\ndesperate as before.\r\n\r\nIt was now debated whether it would be better to go and attack the\r\nbesiegers, or to remain on the defensive. Only one soldier could get\r\nthrough the narrow trap-door at a time, and this made Hobson hesitate,\r\nand finally resolve to wait. The Sergeant and others, whose bravery none\r\ncould doubt, agreed that he was in the right, and it might be possible\r\nthat some new incident would occur to modify the situation. It was\r\nalmost impossible for the bears to break through the beams of the\r\nceiling, as they had the rafters of the roof, so that there was little\r\nfear that they would get on to the ground-floor.\r\n\r\nThe day passed by in anxious expectation, and at night no one could\r\nsleep for the uproar made by the furious beasts.\r\n\r\nThe next day, about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, a fresh complication compelled\r\nHobson to take active steps.\r\n\r\nHe knew that the pipes of the stove and kitchen furnace ran all along\r\nthe loft, and being made of lime-bricks but imperfectly cemented\r\ntogether, they could not resist great pressure for any length of time.\r\nNow some of the bears scratched at the masonry, whilst others leant\r\nagainst the pipes for the sake of the warmth from the stove; so that\r\nthe bricks began to give way, and soon the stoves and furnace ceased to\r\ndraw.\r\n\r\nThis really was an irreparable misfortune, which would have disheartened\r\nless energetic men. But things were not yet at their worst. Whilst the\r\nfire became lower and lower, a thick, nauseous, acrid smoke filled the\r\nhouse; the pipes were broken, and the smoke soon became so thick that\r\nthe lamps went out. Hobson now saw that he must leave the house if he\r\nwished to escape suffocation, but to leave the house would be to perish\r\nwith cold. At this fresh misfortune some of the women screamed; and\r\nHobson, seizing a hatchet, shouted in a loud voice\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the bears! to the bears, my friends !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the forlorn-hope. These terrible creatures must be destroyed. All\r\nrushed into the passage and made for the ladder, Hobson leading the\r\nway. The trap-door was opened, and a few shots were fired into the black\r\nwhirlpool of smoke. Mingled howls and screams were heard, and blood\r\nbegan to flow on both sides; but the fearful conflict was waged in\r\nprofound darkness.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e a terrible rumbling sound suddenly drowned\r\nthe tumult, the ground became violently agitated, and the house rocked\r\nas if it were being torn up from its foundations. The beams of the walls\r\nseparated, and through the openings Hobson and his companions saw the\r\nterrified bears rushing away into the darkness, howling with rage and\r\nfright.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. FIVE MONTHS MORE. A violent earthquake had shaken Cape\r\nBathurst. Such convulsions were probably frequent in this volcanic\r\nregion, and the connection between them and eruptions was once more\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nHobson well understood the significance of what had occurred, and waited\r\nin anxious suspense. He knew that the earth might open and swallow up\r\nthe little colony; but only one shock was felt, and that was rather a\r\nrebound than a vertical upheaval, which made the house lean over towards\r\nthe lake, and burst open its walls. Immediately after this one shock,\r\nthe ground again became firm and motionless.\r\n\r\nThe house, although damaged, was still habitable; the breaches in the\r\nwalls were quickly repaired, and the pipes of the chimneys were patched\r\ntogether again somehow\r\n\r\nFortunately the wounds the soldiers had received in their struggle with\r\nthe bears were slight, and merely required dressing.\r\n\r\nTwo miserable days ensued, during which the woodwork of the beds and the\r\nplanks of the partition walls were burnt, and the most pressing repairs\r\nexecuted by Mac-Nab and his men. The piles, well driven into the earth,\r\nhad not yielded; but it was evident that the earthquake had caused a\r\nsinking of the level of the coast on which the fort was built, which\r\nmight seriously compromise the safety of the building. Hobson was most\r\nanxious to ascertain the extent of the alteration of elevation, but the\r\npitiless cold prevented him from venturing outside.\r\n\r\nBut at last there were symptoms of an approaching change in the weather.\r\nThe stars shone with rather less brilliancy, and on the 11th January\r\nthe barometer fell slightly; hazy vapours floated in the air, the\r\ncondensation of which would raise the temperature; and on the 12th\r\nJanuary the wind veered to the south-west, and snow fell at irregular\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer outside suddenly rose to 15\xc2\xb0 above zero, and to the\r\nfrozen colonists it was like the beginning of spring.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the same morning all were out of doors. They were\r\nlike a band of captives unexpectedly set free. They were, however,\r\nabsolutely forbidden to go beyond the enceinte of the fort, in case of\r\nawkward meetings.\r\n\r\nThe sun had not yet reappeared above the horizon, but it approached it\r\nnearly enough to produce a long twilight, during which objects could be\r\ndistinctly seen to a distance of two miles; and Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s first thought\r\nwas to ascertain what difference the earthquake had produced in the\r\nappearance of the surrounding districts.\r\n\r\nCertain changes had been effected. The crest of the promontory of Cape\r\nBathurst had been broken off, and large pieces of the cliff had been\r\nflung upon the beach. The whole mass of the cape seemed to have been\r\nbent towards the lake, altering the elevation of the plateau on\r\nwhich the fort was built. The soil on the west appeared to have been\r\ndepressed, whilst that on the east had been elevated. One of the results\r\nof this change of level would unfortunately be, that when the thaw set\r\nin, the waters of the lake and of Paulina river, in obedience to the\r\nlaw, requiring liquids to maintain their level, would inundate a portion\r\nof the western coast. The stream would probably scoop out another bed,\r\nand the natural harbour at its mouth would be destroyed. The hills on\r\nthe eastern bank seemed to be considerably depressed, but the cliffs on\r\nthe west were too far off for any accurate observations to be made. The\r\nimportant alteration produced by the earthquake may, in fact, be summed\r\nup in a very few words : the horizontal character of the ground was\r\nreplaced by a slope from east to west.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were good\r\nenough to give my name to the port and river, and now there will be\r\nneither Paulina river nor Port Barnett. I must say I have been hardly\r\nused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9calthough the river is gone, the\r\nlake remains, and we will call it Lake Barnett. I hope that it at least\r\nwill remain true to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Joliffe, on leaving the house, had hurried, one to the\r\ndoghouse, the other to the reindeer-stable. The dogs had not suffered\r\nmuch from their lone, confinement, and rushed into the court barking\r\nwith delight. One reindeer had died, but the others, though thin,\r\nappeared to be in good health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have got through our\r\ntroubles better than we could have expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never despaired,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cThe miseries of an Arctic\r\n-winter would not conquer men like you and your companions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo own the truth, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cI never experienced\r\nsuch intense cold before, in all the years I have spent in the north;\r\nand if it had lasted many days longer we should all have been lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe earthquake came in the nick of time then, not only to drive away\r\nthe bears, but also to modify the extremity of the cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so, madam. All natural phenomena influence each other to a\r\ncertain extent. But the volcanic structure of the soil makes me rather\r\nuneasy. I cannot but regret the close vicinity of this active volcano.\r\nIf the lava from it cannot reach us, the earthquakes connected with it\r\ncan. Just look at our house now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all that can be put right when the fine weather comes, and\r\nyou will make it all the stronger for the painful experience you have\r\ngained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we shall, but meanwhile I am afraid you won\xe2\x80\x99t find it\r\nvery comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you speaking to me, Lieutenant? to an old traveller like me? I\r\nshall imagine myself one of the crew of a small vessel, and now that it\r\ndoes not pitch and toss, I shall have no fear of being sea-sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say does not surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cwe all know\r\nyour grandeur of character, your moral courage and imperturbable good\r\ntemper. You have done much to help us all to bear our troubles, and I\r\nthank you in my own name and that of my men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou flatter me, Lieutenant; you flatter me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I only say what every one thinks. But may I ask you one\r\nquestion. You know that next June, Captain Craventy is to send us a\r\nconvoy with provisions, which will take back our furs to Fort Reliance.\r\nI suppose our friend Thomas Black, after having seen his eclipse, will\r\nreturn with the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s men. Do you mean to accompany him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to send me back?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO madam !\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my superior officer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett, extending her\r\nhand to the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall ask you to allow me to spend another\r\nwinter at Fort Hope. Next year one of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s ships will\r\nprobably anchor off Cape Bathurst, and I shall return in it. Having come\r\noverland, I should like to go back by Behring Strait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant was delighted with his companion\xe2\x80\x99s decision. The two\r\nhad become sincerely attached to each other, and had many tastes and\r\nqualities in common. The hour of separation could not fail to be painful\r\nto both; and who could tell what further trials awaited `the colonists,\r\nin which their combine, influence might sustain the courage of the rest?\r\n\r\nOn the 20th January the sun at last reappeared, and the Polar night was\r\nat an end. It only remained above the horizon for a few minutes, and\r\nwas greeted with joyous hurrahs by the settlers. From this date the days\r\ngradually increased in length.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of February, and until the 15th March, there were\r\nabrupt transitions from fine to bad weather. The fine days were so cold\r\nthat the hunters could not go out; and in the bad weather snowstorms\r\nkept them in. It was only between whiles that any outdoor work could\r\nbe done; and long excursions were out of the question. There was no\r\nnecessity for them, however, as the traps were in full activity. In the\r\nlatter end of the winter, martens, foxes, ermines, wolverines, and\r\nother valuable animals were taken in large numbers, and the trappers had\r\nplenty to do.\r\n\r\nIn March an excursion was ventured on as far as Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay and it\r\nwas noticed that the earthquake had considerably altered the form of the\r\ncliffs, which were much depressed; whilst the igneous hills beyond,\r\nwith their summits wrapped in mist, seemed to look larger and more\r\nthreatening than ever.\r\n\r\nAbout the 20th March the hunters sighted the first swans migrating from\r\nthe south, and uttering shrill cries as they flew. A few snow buntings\r\nand winter hawks were also seen. But the ground was still covered with\r\nthick layers of frozen snow, and the sun was powerless to melt the hard\r\nsurface of the lake and sea.\r\n\r\nThe breaking up of the frost did not commence until early in April. The\r\nice burst with a noise like the discharge of artillery.\r\n\r\nSudden changes took place in the appearance of the icebergs broken by\r\ncollisions, undermined by the action of the water once more set free,\r\nhuge masses rolled over with an awful crash, in consequence of the\r\ndisplacement of their centre of gravity, causing fractures and fissures\r\nin the ice-fields which greatly accelerated their breaking up.\r\n\r\nAt this time the mean temperature was 32\xc2\xb0 above zero, so that the\r\nupper layer of ice on the beach rapidly dissolved, whilst the chain of\r\nicebergs, drifted along by the currents of the Polar Sea, gradually drew\r\nback and became lost in the fogs on the horizon. On the 15th April the\r\nsea was open, and a vessel from the Pacific Ocean coming through Behring\r\nStrait, could certainly have skirted along the American coast, and have\r\nanchored off Cape Bathurst.\r\n\r\nWhilst the ice was disappearing from the ocean, Lake Barnett was also\r\nlaying aside its slippery armour, much to the delight of the thousands\r\nof ducks and other water-fowl which began to teem upon its banks. As\r\nHobson had foreseen, however, the level of the lake was affected by the\r\nslope of the soil. That part of the beach which stretched away from the\r\nenceinte of the fort, and was bounded on the east by wooded hills, had\r\nincreased considerably in extent; and Hobson estimated that the waters\r\nof the lake had receded five hundred paces on the eastern bank. As a\r\nnatural consequence, the water on the western side had risen, and if not\r\nheld back by some natural barrier, would inundate the country.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it was fortunate that the slope was from east to west; for\r\nhad it been from west to east, the factory must have been submerged.\r\n\r\nThe little river dried up as soon as the thaw set free its waters. It\r\nmight almost be said to have run back to its source, so abrupt was the\r\nslope of its bed from north to south.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have now to erase a river from the map of the Arctic regions,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Hobson to his Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been embarrassing if\r\nwe had been dependent on the truant for drinkable water. Fortunately\r\nwe have still Lake Barnett, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose our thirsty men will\r\ndrain it quite dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the lake,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do you\r\nthink its waters have remained sweet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson started and looked at his subordinate with knitted brows. It had\r\nnot occurred to him that a fissure in the ground might have established\r\na communication between the lake and the sea! Should it be so, ruin must\r\nensue, and the factory would inevitably have to be abandoned after all.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant and Hobson rushed to the lake and found their fears\r\ngroundless. Its waters were still sweet.\r\n\r\nEarly in May the snow had disappeared in several places, and a scanty\r\nvegetation clothed the soil. Tiny mosses and slender grasses timidly\r\npushed up their stems above the ground, and the sorrel and cochlearia\r\nseeds which Mrs Joliffe had planted began to sprout. The carpet of snow\r\nhad protected them through the bitter winter; but they had still to be\r\nsaved from the beaks of birds and the teeth of rodents. This arduous\r\nand important task was confided to the worthy Corporal, who acquitted\r\nhimself of it with the zeal and devotion of a scarecrow in a kitchen\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThe long days had now returned, and hunting was resumed.\r\n\r\nHobson was anxious to have a good stock of furs for the agents from Fort\r\nReliance to take charge of when they arrived, as they would do in a\r\nfew weeks. Marbre, Sabine, and the others, therefore, commenced the\r\ncampaign. Their excursions were neither long nor fatiguing : they never\r\nwent further than two miles from Cape Bathurst, for they had never\r\nbefore been in a district so well stocked with game; and they were both\r\nsurprised and delighted. Martens, reindeer, hares, caribous, foxes, and\r\nermines passed close to their guns.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, excited some regret in the minds of the colonists,\r\nnot a trace was to be seen of their old enemies the bears; and it\r\nseemed as if they had taken all their relations with them. Perhaps\r\nthe earthquake had frightened them away, for they have a very delicate\r\nnervous organisation, if such an expression can be applied to a mere\r\nquadruped. It was a pity they were gone, for vengeance could not be\r\nwreaked upon them.\r\n\r\nThe month of May was very wet. Rain and snow succeeded each other.\r\nThe mean temperature was only 41\xc2\xb0 above zero. Fogs were of frequent\r\noccurrence, and so thick that it would often have been imprudent to\r\ngo any distance from the fort. Petersen and Kellet once caused their\r\ncompanions grave anxiety by disappearing for forty-eight hours. They had\r\nlost their way, and turned to the south when they thought they were near\r\nto Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay. They came back exhausted and half dead with hunger.\r\n\r\nJune came at last, and with it really fine warm weather. The colonists\r\nwere able to leave off their winter clothing. They worked zealously at\r\nrepairing the house, the foundations of which had to be propped up; and\r\nHobson also ordered the construction of a large magazine at the southern\r\ncorner of the court. The quantity of game justified the expenditure\r\nof time and labour involved : the number of furs collected was already\r\nconsiderable, and it was necessary to have some place set aside in which\r\nto keep them.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant now expected every day the arrival of the detachment to\r\nbe sent by Captain Craventy. A good many things were still required for\r\nthe new settlement. The stores were getting low; and if the party had\r\nleft the fort in the beginning of May, they ought to reach Cape Bathurst\r\ntowards the middle of June. It will be remembered that the Captain and\r\nhis Lieutenant had fixed upon the cape as the spot of rendezvous, and\r\nHobson having constructed his fort on it, there was no fear of the\r\nreinforcements failing to find him.\r\n\r\nFrom the 15th June the districts surrounding the cape were carefully\r\nwatched. The British flag waved from the summit of the cliff, and could\r\nbe seen at a considerable distance. It was probable that the convoy\r\nwould follow the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s example, and skirt along the coast from\r\nCoronation Gulf. If not exactly the shortest, it was the surest route,\r\nat a time when, the sea being free from ice, the coast-line could be\r\neasily followed.\r\n\r\nWhen the month of June passed without the arrival of the expected party,\r\nHobson began to feel rather uneasy, especially as the country again\r\nbecame wrapped in fogs. He began to fear that the agents might lose\r\ntheir way, and often talked the matter over with Mrs Barnett, Mac-Nab,\r\nand Rae.\r\n\r\nThomas Black made no attempt to conceal his uneasiness, for he was\r\nanxious to return with the party from Fort Reliance as soon as he had\r\nseen his eclipse; and should anything keep them back from coming, he\r\nwould have to resign himself to another winter, a prospect which did not\r\nplease him at all; and in reply to his eager questions, Hobson could say\r\nlittle to reassure him.\r\n\r\nThe 4th July dawned. No news! Some men sent to the southeast to\r\nreconnoitre, returned, bringing no tidings.\r\n\r\nEither the agents had never started, or they had lost their way. The\r\nlatter hypothesis was unfortunately the more probable. Hobson knew\r\nCaptain Craventy, and felt confident that he had sent off the convoy at\r\nthe time named.\r\n\r\nHis increasing anxiety will therefore be readily understood. The fine\r\nseason was rapidly passing away. Another two months and the Arctic\r\nwinter, with its bitter winds, its whirlpools of snow, and its long\r\nnights, would again set in.\r\n\r\nHobson, as we well know, was not a man to yield to misfortune without a\r\nstruggle. Something must be done, and with the ready concurrence of the\r\nastronomer the following plan was decided on.\r\n\r\nIt was now the 5th July. In another fortnight-July 18th-the solar\r\neclipse was to take place, and after that Thomas Black would be free to\r\nleave Fort Hope. It was therefore agreed that if by that time the agents\r\nhad not arrived, a convoy of a few men and four or five sledges should\r\nleave the factory, and make for the Great Slave Lake, taking with them\r\nsome of the most valuable furs; and if no accident befell them, they\r\nmight hope to arrive at Fort Reliance in six weeks at the latest-that is\r\nto say, towards the end of August.\r\n\r\nThis matter settled, Thomas Black shrank back into his shell, and\r\nbecame once more the man of one idea, awaiting the moment when the moon,\r\npassing between the orb of day and \xe2\x80\x9chimself,\xe2\x80\x9d should totally eclipse\r\nthe disc of the sun.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE ECLIPSE OF THE 18TH JULY 1860. The mists did not\r\ndisperse. The sun shone feebly through thick curtains of fog, and the\r\nastronomer began to have a great dread lest the eclipse should not be\r\nvisible after all. Sometimes the fog was so dense that the summit of the\r\ncape could not be seen from the court of the fort.\r\n\r\nHobson got more and more uneasy. He had no longer any doubt that\r\nthe convoy had gone astray in the strange land; moreover, vague\r\napprehensions and sad forebodings increased his depression. He could not\r\nlook into the future with any confidence\xe2\x80\x94why, he would have found it\r\nimpossible to explain. Everything apparently combined to reassure him.\r\nIn spite of the great rigour of the winter, his little colony was in\r\nexcellent health. No quarrels had arisen amongst the colonists, and\r\ntheir zeal and enthusiasm was still unabated. The surrounding districts\r\nwere well stocked with game, the harvest of furs had surpassed his\r\nexpectations, and the Company might well be satisfied with the result\r\nof the enterprise. Even if no fresh supply of provisions arrived, the\r\nresources of the country were such that the prospect of a second winter\r\nneed awake no misgivings. Why, then, was Lieutenant Hobson losing hope\r\nand confidence?\r\n\r\nHe and Mrs Barnett had many a talk on the subject; and the latter did\r\nall she could to raise the drooping spirits of the commanding officer,\r\nurging upon him all the considerations enumerated above; and one day\r\nwalking with him along the beach, she pleaded the cause of Cape Bathurst\r\nand the factory, built at the cost of-so much suffering, with more than\r\nusual eloquence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, madam, you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help our presentiments. I am no visionary. Twenty times in my\r\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s life I have been in critical circumstances, and have never\r\nlost presence of mind for one instant; and now for the first time in my\r\nlife I am uneasy about the future. If I had to face a positive danger, I\r\nshould have no fear; but a vague uncertain peril of which I have only a\r\npresentiment \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat danger do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9ca danger from\r\nmen, from animals, or the elements?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf animals I have no dread whatever, madam; it is for them to tremble\r\nbefore the hunters of Cape Bathurst, nor do I fear men; these districts\r\nare frequented by none but Esquimaux, and the Indians seldom venture so\r\nfar north.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Canadians, whose\r\narrival you so much feared in the fine season, have never appeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry for it, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you regret the absence of the rivals who are so evidently\r\nhostile to your Company?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, I am both glad and sorry that they have not come; that will\r\nof course puzzle you. But observe that the expected convoy from Fort\r\nReliance has not arrived. It is the same with. the agents of the St\r\nLouis Fur Company; they might have come, and they have not done so. Not\r\na single Esquimaux has visited this part of the coast during the summer\r\neither\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you conclude from all this?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conclude that it is not so easy to get to Cape Bathurst or to Fort\r\nHope as we could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady looked into the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s anxious face, struck with the\r\nmelancholy and significant intonation of the word easy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Hobson,\xe2\x80\x9d she said earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you fear neither\r\nmen nor animals, I must conclude that your anxiety has reference to the\r\nelements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know if my spirit be broken, or if\r\nmy presentiments blind me, but there seems to me to be something uncanny\r\nabout this district. If I had known it better I should not have\r\nsettled down in it. I have already called your attention to certain\r\npeculiarities, which to me appear inexplicable; the total absence of\r\nstones everywhere, and the clear-cut line of the coast. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nout about the primitive formation of this end of the continent. I\r\nknow that the vicinity of a volcano may cause some phenomena; but you\r\nremember what I said to you on the subject of the tides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the sea ought according to the observations of explorers in\r\nthese latitudes, to have risen fifteen or twenty feet, it has scarcely\r\nrisen one !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but that you accounted for by the irregular distribution of land\r\nand the narrowness of the straits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to account for it, that is all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nday before yesterday I noticed a still more extraordinary phenomenon,\r\nwhich I cannot even try to explain, and I doubt if the greatest savants\r\ncould do so either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett looked inquiringly at Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the day before yesterday, madam, when the moon was full, and\r\naccording to the almanac the tide ought to have been very high, the sea\r\ndid not even rise one foot, as it did before-it did not rise at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you may be mistaken observed Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not mistaken. I saw it with my own eyes. The day before\r\nyesterday, July 4th, there was positively no tide on the coast of Cape\r\nBathurst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you conclude from that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conclude madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9ceither that the laws\r\nof nature are changed, or that this district is very peculiarly situated\r\n. . . or rather . . . I conclude nothing . . . I explain nothing . . . I\r\nam puzzled. . . I do not understand it; and therefore . . . therefore I\r\nam anxious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett asked no more questions. Evidently the total absence of\r\ntides was as unnatural and inexplicable as would be the absence of the\r\nsun from the meridian at noon. Unless the earthquake had so modified the\r\nconformation of the coast of the Arctic regions as to account for it-but\r\nno, such an idea could not be entertained by any one accustomed to note\r\nterrestrial phenomena.\r\n\r\nAs for supposing that the Lieutenant could be mistaken in his\r\nobservations, that was impossible; and that very day he and Mrs Barnett,\r\nby means of beach-marks made on the beach, ascertained beyond all doubt\r\nthat whereas a year before the sea rose a foot, there was now no tide\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe matter was kept a profound secret, as Hobson was unwilling to render\r\nhis companions anxious. But he might often be seen standing motionless\r\nand silent upon the summit of the cape, gazing across the sea, which was\r\nnow open, and stretched away as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of July hunting the furred animals was discontinued, as\r\nthe martens, foxes, and others had already lost their winter beauty.\r\nNo game was brought down but that required for food, such as caribous,\r\nPolar hares, &c., which, strange to say, instead of being scared away by\r\nthe guns, continued to multiply near the fort. Mrs Barnett did not fail\r\nto note this peculiar, and, as the event proved, significant fact.\r\n\r\nNo change had taken place in the situation on the 15th July. No news\r\nfrom Fort Reliance. The expected convoy did not arrive, and Hobson\r\nresolved to execute his project of sending to Captain Craventy, as\r\nCaptain Craventy did not come to him.\r\n\r\nOf course none but Sergeant Long could be appointed to the command of\r\nthe little troop, although the faithful fellow would rather not have\r\nbeen separated from his Lieutenant. A considerable time must necessarily\r\nelapse before he could get back to Fort Hope. He would have to pass the\r\nwinter at Fort Reliance, and return the next summer. Eight months\r\nat least! It is true either Mac-Nab or Rae could have taken the\r\nSergeant\xe2\x80\x99s place; but then they were married, and the one being a\r\nmaster carpenter, and the other the only blacksmith, the colonists could\r\nnot well have dispensed with their services.\r\n\r\nSuch were the grounds on which the Lieutenant chose Long, and the\r\nSergeant submitted with military obedience. The four soldiers elected\r\nto accompany him were Belcher, Pond, Petersen, and Kellet, who declared\r\ntheir readiness to start.\r\n\r\nFour sledges and their teams of dogs were told off for the service. They\r\nwere to take a good stock of provisions, and the most valuable of the\r\nfurs. Foxes, ermines, martens, swans, lynxes, musk-rats, gluttons, &c.,\r\nall contributed to the precious convoy. The start was fixed for the\r\nmorning of the 19th July, the day after the eclipse. Of course Thomas\r\nBlack was to accompany the Sergeant, and one sledge was to convoy his\r\nprecious person and instruments.\r\n\r\nThe worthy savant endured agonies of suspense in the few days preceding\r\nthe phenomenon which he awaited with so much impatience. He might well\r\nbe anxious; for one day it was fine and another wet, now mists obscured\r\nthe sun, or thick fogs hid it all together; and the wind veered to every\r\npoint of the horizon with provoking fickleness and uncertainty. What\r\nif during the few moments of the eclipse the queen of the night and the\r\ngreat orb of day should be wrapped in an opaque cloud at the critical\r\nmoment, so that he, the astronomer, Thomas Black, come so far to watch\r\nthe phenomenon, should be unable to see the luminous corona or the red\r\nprominences! How terrible would be the disappointment! How many dangers,\r\nhow much suffering, how much fatigue, would have been gone through in\r\nvain !\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have come so far to see the moon, and not to see it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried\r\nin a comically piteous tone.\r\n\r\nNo, he could not face the thought and early of an evening he would climb\r\nto the summit of the cape and gaze into the heavens. The fair Phoebe\r\nwas nowhere to be seen; for it being three days before new moon, she was\r\naccompanying the sun in his daily course, and her light was quenched in\r\nhis beams.\r\n\r\nMany a time did Thomas Black relieve his over-burdened heart by pouring\r\nout his troubles to Mrs Barnett. The good lady felt sincerely sorry\r\nfor him, and one day, anxious to reassure him, she told him that the\r\nbarometer showed a certain tendency to rise, and reminded him that they\r\nwere in the fine season.\r\n\r\nThe fine season !\xe2\x80\x9d cried the poor astronomer\xe2\x80\x9d shrugging his\r\nshoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cWho can speak of a fine season in such a country as\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but, Mr Black,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose, for the sake\r\nof argument, that you miss this eclipse by any unlucky chance, I suppose\r\nthere will be another some day. The eclipse of July 18th will not be the\r\nlast of this century.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam, no,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Black; \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be five more total\r\neclipses of the sun before 1900. One on the 31st December 1861, which\r\nwill be total for the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Sahara\r\nDesert; a second on the 22d December 1870, total for the Azores, the\r\nsouth of Spain, Algeria, Sicily, and Turkey; a third on the 19th August\r\n1887, total for the north-east of Germany, the south of Russia, and\r\nCentral Asia; a fourth on the 9th April 1896, visible in Greenland,\r\nLapland, and Siberia; and lastly, a fifth on the 28th May 1900, which\r\nwill be total for the United States, Spain, Algeria, and\r\n\r\nEgypt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr Black,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cif you lose the eclipse of\r\nthe 18th July 1860, you can console yourself by looking forward to that\r\nof the 31st December 1861. It will only be seventeen months !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can console myself, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the astronomer gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nlooking forward to that of 1896. I shall have to wait not seventeen\r\nmonths but thirty-six years !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of all the eclipses, it alone-that of 9th August 1896-will\r\nbe total for places in high latitudes, such as Lapland, Siberia, or\r\nGreenland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the special interest of an observation taken in these\r\nelevated latitudes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat special interest?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Thomas Black; why, a scientific\r\ninterest of the highest importance. Eclipses have very rarely been\r\nwatched near the Pole, where the sun, being very little above the\r\nhorizon, is considerably increased in size. The disc of the moon which\r\nis to intervene between us and the sun is subject to a similar apparent\r\nextension, and therefore it may be that the red prominences and the\r\nluminous corona can be more thoroughly examined This, madam, is why\r\nI have travelled all this distance to watch the eclipse above the\r\nseventieth parallel. A similar opportunity will not occur until 1896,\r\nand who can tell if I shall be alive then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this burst of enthusiasm there was no reply to be made; and the\r\nastronomer\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety and depression increased, for the inconstant\r\nweather seemed more and more disposed to play him some ill-natured\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\nIt was very fine on the 16th July, but the next day it was cloudy and\r\nmisty and Thomas Black became really ill. The feverish state he had been\r\nin for so long seemed likely to result in a serious illness. Mrs Barnett\r\nand Hobson tried in vain to soothe him, and Sergeant Long and the others\r\ncould not understand how it was possible to be so unhappy for love of\r\nthe moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last the great day-the 18th July-dawned. According to the\r\ncalculations of astronomers, the total eclipse was to last four minutes\r\nthirty-seven seconds-that is to say, from forty-three minutes fifteen\r\nseconds past eleven to forty-seven minutes fifty-seven seconds past\r\neleven A.M.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I ask? what do I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d moaned the astronomer, tearing his\r\nhair. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly one little corner of the sky free from clouds! only the\r\nsmall space in which the eclipse is to take place ! And for how long?\r\nFor four short minutes! After that, let it snow, let it thunder, let the\r\nelements break loose in fury, I should care no more for it all than a\r\nsnail for a chronometer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied that Thomas Black had some grounds for his\r\nfears. It really seemed likely that observations would be impossible. At\r\ndaybreak the horizon was shrouded in mists Heavy clouds were coming up\r\nfrom the south, and covering the very portion of the sky in which the\r\neclipse was to take place. But doubtless the patron saint of astronomers\r\nhad pity on poor Black, for towards eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock a slight wind arose\r\nand swept the mists and clouds from the sky, leaving it bright and\r\nclear!\r\n\r\nA cry of gratitude burst from the lips of the astronomer, and his heart\r\nbeat high with newly-awakened hope. The sun shone brightly, and the\r\nmoon, so soon to darken it, was as yet invisible in its glorious beams.\r\n\r\nThomas Black\xe2\x80\x99s instruments were already carefully placed on the\r\npromontory, and having pointed them towards the southern horizon, he\r\nawaited the event with calmness restored, and the coolness necessary for\r\ntaking his observation. What was there left to fear?\r\n\r\nNothing, unless it was that the sky might fall upon his head! At nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock there was not a cloud, not a vapour left upon the sky from the\r\nzenith to the horizon. Never were circumstances more favourable to an\r\nastronomical observation.\r\n\r\nThe whole party were anxious to take part in the observation, and all\r\ngathered round the astronomer on Cape Bathurst. Gradually the sun rose\r\nabove the horizon, describing an extended arc above the vast plain\r\nstretching away to the south. No one spoke, but awaited the eclipse in\r\nsolemn silence.\r\n\r\nTowards half-past nine the eclipse commenced The disc of the moon\r\nseemed to graze that of the sun. But the moon\xe2\x80\x99s shadow was not to\r\nfall completely on the earth, hiding the sun, until between forty three\r\nminutes past eleven and forty-seven minutes fifty-seven seconds past\r\neleven. That was the time fixed in the almanacs, and every one knows\r\nthat no error can creep into them, established, verified, and controlled\r\nas they are by the scientific men of all the observatories in the world.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer had brought a good many glasses with him, and he\r\ndistributed them amongst his companions, that all might watch the\r\nprogress of the phenomenon without injury to the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe brown disc of the moon gradually advanced, and terrestrial objects\r\nbegan to assume a peculiar orange hue, whilst the atmosphere on tire\r\nzenith completely changed colour. At a quarter-past ten half the disc\r\nof the sun was darkened, and a few dogs which happened to be at liberty\r\nshowed signs of uneasiness and howled piteously. The wild ducks,\r\nthinking night had come, began to utter sleepy calls -and to seek their\r\nnests, and the mothers gathered their little ones under their wings. The\r\nhush of eventide fell upon all animated nature.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock two-thirds of the sun were covered, and all\r\nterrestrial objects became a kind of vinous red. A gloomy twilight set\r\nin, to be succeeded during the four minutes of totality by absolute\r\ndarkness. A few planets, amongst t others Mercury and Venus, began\r\nto appear, and some constellations\xe2\x80\x94Caplet, [symbol] and [symbol] of\r\nTaurus, and [symbol] of Orion. The darkness deepened every moment.\r\n\r\nThomas Black remained motionless with his eye glued to the glass of\r\nhis instrument, eagerly watching the progress of the phenomenon. At\r\nforty-three minutes past eleven the discs of the two luminaries ought\r\nto be exactly opposite to each other, that of the moon completely hiding\r\nthat of the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForty-three minutes past eleven,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Hobson, who was\r\nattentively watching the minute hand of his chronometer.\r\n\r\nThomas Black remained motionless, stooping over his instrument. Half a\r\nminute passed, and then the astronomer [astonomer] drew himself up,\r\nwith eyes distended and eager. Once more he bent over the telescope, and\r\ncried in a choked voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is going! she is going! The moon, the moon is going! She is\r\ndisappearing, running away !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrue enough the disc of the moon was gliding away from that of the sun\r\nwithout having completely covered it !\r\n\r\nThe astronomer had fallen backwards, completely overcome. The four\r\nminutes were past. The luminous corona had not appeared !\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter is,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the poor astronomer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the eclipse\r\nwas not total-not total for this portion of the globe! Do you hear? It\r\nwas not to-t-a-1! I say not to-t-a-l! !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your almanacs are incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIncorrect! Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell that to me, if you please, Lieutenant Hobson\r\n!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, suddenly changing countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Black, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not after all on the seventieth\r\nparallel !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly fancy !\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can soon prove it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the astronomer whose eyes flashed with\r\nrage and disappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sun will pass the meridian in a few\r\nminutes. . . . My sextant-quick . . . make haste !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the soldiers rushed to the house and fetched the instrument\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer pointed it upon the sun; he watched the orb of day pass\r\nthe meridian, and rapidly noted down a few calculations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the situation of Cape Bathurst a year ago when we took the\r\nlatitude?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy degrees, forty-four minutes, and thirty-seven seconds,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, it is now seventy-three degrees, seven minutes, and twenty\r\nseconds! You see we are not under the seventieth parallel !\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr rather we are no longer there !\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Hobson.\r\n\r\nA sudden light had broken in upon his mind, all the phenomena hitherto\r\nso inexplicable were now explained.\r\n\r\nCape Bathurst had drifted three degrees farther north since the arrival\r\nof the Lieutenant and his companions !\r\n\r\nEnd of Part I PART II CONTENTS.

A FLOATING FORT. And so Fort Hope, founded by Lieutenant\r\nHobson on the borders of the Polar Sea, had drifted! Was the courageous\r\nagent of the Company to blame for this? No; any one might have been\r\ndeceived as he had been. No human prevision could have foreseen such a\r\ncalamity. He meant to build upon a rock, and he had not even built upon\r\nsand. The peninsula of Victoria, which the best maps of English America\r\njoin to the American continent, had been torn suddenly away from it.\r\nThis peninsula was in fact nothing but an immense piece of ice, five\r\nhundred square miles in extent, converted by successive deposits of sand\r\nand earth into apparently solid ground well clothed with vegetation.\r\nConnected with the mainland for thousands of centuries, the earthquake\r\nof the 8th of January had dragged it away from its moorings, and it was\r\nnow a floating island, at the mercy of the winds and waves, and had been\r\ncarried along the Arctic Ocean by powerful currents for the last three\r\nmonths!\r\n\r\nYes, Fort Hope was built upon ice! Hobson at once understood the\r\nmysterious change in their latitude. The isthmus\xe2\x80\x94that is to say,\r\nthe neck of land which connected the peninsula of Victoria with\r\nthe mainland\xe2\x80\x94had been snapped in two by a subterranean convulsion\r\nconnected with the eruption of the volcano some months before. As long\r\nas the northern winter continued, the frozen sea maintained things as\r\nthey were; but when the thaw came, when the ice fields, melted beneath\r\nthe rays of the sun, and the huge icebergs, driven out into the offing,\r\ndrew back to the farthest limits of the horizon\xe2\x80\x94when the sea at last\r\nbecame open, the whole peninsula drifted away, with its woods, its\r\ncliffs, its promontories, its inland lagoon, and its coast-line, under\r\nthe influence of a current about which nothing was known. For months\r\nthis drifting had been going on unnoticed by the colonists, who even\r\nwhen hunting did not go far from Fort Hope. Beach-marks, if they had\r\nbeen made, would have been useless; for heavy mists obscured everything\r\nat a short distance, the ground remained apparently firm and motionless,\r\nand there was, in short, nothing to hint to the Lieutenant and his men\r\nthat they had become islanders. The position of the new island with\r\nregard to the rising and setting of the sun was the same as before. Had\r\nthe cardinal points changed their position, had the island turned round,\r\nthe Lieutenant, the astronomer, or Mrs Barnett, would certainly have\r\nnoticed and understood the change; but in its course the island had thus\r\nfar followed a parallel of latitude, and its motion, though rapid, had\r\nbeen imperceptible.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hobson had no doubt of the moral and physical courage and\r\ndetermination of his companions, he determined not to acquaint them\r\nwith the truth. It would be time enough to tell them of their altered\r\nposition when it had been thoroughly studied. Fortunately the good\r\nfellows, soldiers or workmen, took little notice of the astronomical\r\nobservations, and not being able to see the consequences involved, they\r\ndid not trouble themselves about the change of latitude just announced.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant determined to conceal his anxiety, and seeing no remedy\r\nfor the misfortune, mastered his emotion by a strong effort, and tried\r\nto console Thomas Black, who was lamenting his disappointment and\r\ntearing his hair.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer had no doubt about the misfortune of which he was the\r\nvictim. Not having, like the Lieutenant, noticed the peculiarities\r\nof the district, he did not look beyond the one fact in which he was\r\ninterested: on the day fixed, at the time named, the moon had not\r\ncompletely eclipsed the sun. And what could he conclude but that, to the\r\ndisgrace of observatories, the almanacs were false, and that the long\r\ndesired eclipse, his own eclipse, Thomas Black\xe2\x80\x99s, which he had come\r\nso far and through so many dangers to see, had not been \xe2\x80\x9ctotal\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nthis particular district under the seventieth parallel! No, no, it was\r\nimpossible to believe it; he could not face the terrible certainty, and\r\nhe was overwhelmed with disappointment. He was soon to learn the truth,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hobson let his men imagine that the failure of the eclipse\r\ncould only interest himself and the astronomer, and they returned to\r\ntheir ordinary occupations; but as they were leaving, Corporal Joliffe\r\nstopped suddenly and said, touching his cap\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask you one question, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, Corporal; say on,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, who wondered\r\nwhat was coming.\r\n\r\nBut Joliffe hesitated, and his little wife nudged his elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the Corporal, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s just about\r\nthe seventieth degree of latitude\xe2\x80\x94if we are not where we thought we\r\nwere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant frowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied evasively, \xe2\x80\x9cwe made a mistake in our reckoning,\r\n... our first observation was wrong; ... but what does that concern\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the pay,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joliffe with\r\na scowl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know well enough that the Company promised us double\r\npay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson drew a sigh of relief. It will be remembered that the men had\r\nbeen promised higher pay if they succeeded in settling on or above the\r\nseventieth degree north latitude, and Joliffe, who always had an eye to\r\nthe main chance, had looked upon the whole matter from a monetary point\r\nof view, and was afraid the bounty would be withheld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson with a smile; \xe2\x80\x9cand you can\r\ntell your brave comrades that our mistake, which is really inexplicable,\r\nwill not in the least prejudice your interests. We are not below, but\r\nabove the seventieth parallel, and so you will get your double pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joliffe with a beaming face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t that we think much about money, but that the money sticks\r\nto us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this sage remark the men drew off, little dreaming what a\r\nstrange and fearful change had taken place in the position of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSergeant Long was about to follow the others when Hobson stopped him\r\nwith the words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemain here, Sergeant Long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe subordinate officer turned on his heel and waited for the Lieutenant\r\nto address him.\r\n\r\nAll had now left the cape except Mrs Barnett, Madge, Thomas Black, and\r\nthe two officers.\r\n\r\nSince the eclipse Mrs Barnett had not uttered a word. She looked\r\ninquiringly at Hobson, who tried to avoid meeting her eyes.\r\n\r\nFor some time not another word was spoken. All involuntarily turned\r\ntowards the south, where the broken isthmus was situated; but from their\r\nposition they could only see the sea horizon on the north. Had Cape\r\nBathurst been situated a few hundred feet more above the level of the\r\nocean, they would have been able at a glance to ascertain the limits of\r\ntheir island home.\r\n\r\nAll were deeply moved at the sight of Fort Hope and all its occupants\r\nborne away from all solid ground, and floating at the mercy of winds and\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett at last, \xe2\x80\x9call the strange\r\nphenomena you observed are now explained!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is explained. The peninsula\r\nof Victoria, now an island, which we thought firm ground with an\r\nimmovable foundation, is nothing more than a vast sheet of ice welded\r\nfor centuries to the American continent. Gradually the wind has strewn\r\nit with earth and sand, and scattered over them the seeds from which\r\nhave sprung the trees and mosses with which it is clothed. Rain-water\r\nfilled the lagoon, and produced the little river; vegetation transformed\r\nthe appearance of the ground; but beneath the lake, beneath the soil\r\nof earth and sand\xe2\x80\x94in a word, beneath our feet is a foundation of ice,\r\nwhich floats upon the water by reason of its being specifically lighter\r\nthan it. Yes, it is a sheet of ice which bears us up, and is carrying us\r\naway, and this is why we have not found a single flint or stone upon its\r\nsurface. This is why its shores are perpendicular, this is why we found\r\nice ten feet below the surface when we dug the reindeer pit\xe2\x80\x94this, in\r\nshort, is why the tide was not noticeable on the peninsula, which rose\r\nand sank with the ebb and flow of the waves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is indeed explained,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cand your\r\npresentiments did not deceive you; but can you explain why the tides,\r\nwhich do not affect us at all now, were to a slight extent perceptible\r\non our arrival?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply because, madam, on our arrival the peninsula was still\r\nconnected by means of its flexible isthmus with the American continent.\r\nIt offered a certain resistance to the current, and on its northern\r\nshores the tide rose two feet beyond low-water mark, instead of the\r\ntwenty we reasonably expected. But from the moment when the earthquake\r\nbroke the connecting link, from the moment when the peninsula became an\r\nisland free from all control, it rose and sank with the ebb and flow of\r\nthe tide; and, as we noticed together at full moon a few days ago, no\r\nsensible difference was produced on our shores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of his despair, Thomas Black listened attentively to\r\nHobson\xe2\x80\x99s explanations, and could not but see the reasonableness of his\r\ndeductions, but he was furious at such a rare, unexpected, and, as he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cridiculous\xe2\x80\x9d phenomenon occurring just so as to make him\r\nmiss the eclipse, and he said not a word, but maintained a gloomy, even\r\nhaughty silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mr Black,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cit must be owned that an\r\nastronomer was never more hardly used than you since the world began!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn any case, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, turning to her, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have\r\nneither of us anything to reproach ourselves with. No one can find\r\nfault with us. Nature alone is to blame. The earthquake cut off our\r\ncommunication with the mainland, and converted our peninsula into a\r\nfloating island, and this explains why the furred and other animals\r\nimprisoned like ourselves, have become so numerous round the fort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, too, is why the rivals you so much dreaded have not visited us,\r\nLieutenant!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9caccounts for the non-arrival of\r\nthe convoy sent to Cape Bathurst by Captain Craventy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is why,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Barnett, looking at the Lieutenant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must give up all hope of returning to Europe this year at least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of voice in which the lady made this last remark showed that\r\nshe resigned herself to her fate more readily than could have been\r\nexpected. She seemed suddenly to have made up her mind to make the best\r\nof the situation, which would no doubt give her an opportunity of making\r\na great many interesting observations. And after all, what good would\r\ngrumbling have done? Recriminations were worse than useless. They could\r\nnot have altered their position, or have checked the course of the\r\nwandering island, and there was no means of reuniting it to a continent.\r\nNo; God alone could decide the future of Fort Hope. They must bow to His\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. WHERE ARE WE? It was necessary carefully to study the\r\nunexpected and novel situation in which the agents of the Company now\r\nfound themselves, and Hobson did so with his chart before him.\r\n\r\nHe could not ascertain the longitude of Victoria Island\xe2\x80\x94the original\r\nname being retained\xe2\x80\x94until the next day, and the latitude had\r\nalready been taken. For the longitude, the altitude of the sun must be\r\nascertained before and after noon, and two hour angles must be measured.\r\n\r\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M. Hobson and Black took the height of the sun above\r\nthe horizon with the sextant, and they hoped to recommence the same\r\noperation the next morning towards ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock A.M., so as to be able\r\nto infer from the two altitudes obtained the exact point of the Arctic\r\nOcean then occupied by their island.\r\n\r\nThe party did not, however, at once return to the fort, but remained\r\ntalking together for some little time on the promontory. Madge declared\r\nshe was quite resigned, and evidently thought only of her mistress, at\r\nwhom she could not look without emotion; she could not bear to think of\r\nthe sufferings and trials her \xe2\x80\x9cdear girl\xe2\x80\x9d might have to go through\r\nin the future. She was ready to lay down her life for \xe2\x80\x9cPaulina,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nwhat good could that do now. She knew, however, that Mrs Barnett was not\r\na woman to sink under her misfortunes, and indeed at present there was\r\nreally no need for any one to despair.\r\n\r\nThere was no immediate danger to be dreaded, and a catastrophe might\r\neven yet be avoided. This Hobson carefully explained to his companions.\r\n\r\nTwo dangers threatened the island floating along the coast of North\r\nAmerica, only two.\r\n\r\nIt would be drawn by the currents of the open sea to the high Polar\r\nlatitudes, from which there is no return.\r\n\r\nOr the current would take it to the south, perhaps through the Behring\r\nStrait into the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn the former contingency, the colonists, shut in by ice and surrounded\r\nby impassable icebergs, would have no means of communication with their\r\nfellow-creatures, and would die of cold and hunger in the solitudes of\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nIn the latter contingency, Victoria Island, driven by the currents to\r\nthe western waters of the Pacific, would gradually melt and go to pieces\r\nbeneath the feet of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn either case death would await the Lieutenant and his companions, and\r\nthe fort, erected at the cost of so much labour and suffering, would be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nBut it was scarcely probable that either of these events would happen.\r\nThe season was already considerably advanced, and in less than three\r\nmonths the sea would again be rendered motion less by the icy hand of\r\nthe Polar winter. The ocean would again be converted into an ice-field,\r\nand by means of sledges they might get to the nearest land\xe2\x80\x94the coast\r\nof Russian America if the island remained in the east, or the coast of\r\nAsia if it were driven to the west.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have absolutely no control over our\r\nfloating island. Having no sail to hoist, as in a boat, we cannot guide\r\nit in the least. Where it takes us we must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll that Hobson said was clear, concise, and to the point. There could\r\nbe no doubt that the bitter cold of winter would solder Victoria Island\r\nto the vast ice-field, and it was highly probable that it would drift\r\nneither too far north nor too far eouth. To have to cross a few hundred\r\nmiles of ice was no such terrible prospect for brave and resolute\r\nmen accustomed to long excursions in the Arctic regions. It would be\r\nnecessary, it was true, to abandon Fort Hope\xe2\x80\x94the object of so many\r\nhopes, and to lose the benefit of all their exertions, but what of that?\r\nThe factory, built upon a shifting soil, could be of no further use to\r\nthe Company. Sooner or later it would be swallowed up by the ocean, and\r\nwhat was the good of useless regrets? It must, therefore, be deserted as\r\nsoon as circumstances should permit.\r\n\r\nThe only thing against the safety of the colonists was\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nLieutenant dwelt long on this point\xe2\x80\x94that during the eight or nine\r\nweeks which must elapse before the solidification of the Arctic Ocean,\r\nVictoria Island might be dragged too far north or south.\r\n\r\nArctic explorers had often told of pieces of ice being drifted an\r\nimmense distance without any possibility of stopping them.\r\n\r\nEverything then depended on the force and direction of the currents from\r\nthe opening of Behring Strait; and it would be necessary carefully to\r\nascertain all that a chart of the Arctic Ocean could tell. Hobson had\r\nsuch a chart, and invited all who were with him on the cape to come to\r\nhis room and look at it; but before going down to the fort he once more\r\nurged upon them the necessity of keeping their situation a secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not yet desperate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is therefore quite\r\nunnecessary to damp the spirits of our comrades, who will perhaps not be\r\nable to understand, as we do, all the chances in our favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it not be prudent to build a boat large enough to hold us\r\nall, and strong enough to carry us a few hundred miles over the sea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be prudent certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will do it.\r\nI must think of some pretext for beginning the work at once, and give\r\nthe necessary orders to the head carpenter. But taking to a boat can\r\nonly be a forlorn hope when everything else has failed. We must try all\r\nwe can to avoid being on the island when the ice breaks up, and we must\r\nmake for the mainland as soon as ever the sea is frozen over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson was right. It would take about three months to build a thirty\r\nor thirty-five ton vessel, and the sea would not be open when it was\r\nfinished. It would be very dangerous to embark the whole party when\r\nthe ice was breaking up all round, and he would be well out of his\r\ndifficulties if he could get across the ice to firm ground before the\r\nnext thaw set in. This was why Hobson thought a boat a forlorn hope, a\r\ndesperate makeshift, and every one agreed with him.\r\n\r\nSecrecy was once more promised, for it was felt that Hobson was the best\r\njudge of the matter, and a few minutes later the five conspirators were\r\nseated together in the large room of Fort Hope, which was then deserted,\r\neagerly examining an excellent map of the oceanic and atmospheric\r\ncurrents of the Arctic Ocean, special attention being naturally given to\r\nthat part of the Polar Sea between Cape Bathurst and Behring Strait.\r\n\r\nTwo principal currents divide the dangerous latitudes comprehended\r\nbetween the Polar Circle and the imperfectly known zone, called the\r\nNorth-West Passage since McClure\xe2\x80\x99s daring discovery\xe2\x80\x94at least only\r\ntwo have been hitherto noticed by marine surveyors.\r\n\r\nOne is called the Kamtchatka Current. It takes its rise in the offing\r\noutside the peninsula of that name, follows the coast of Asia, and\r\npasses through Behring Strait, touching Cape East, a promontory of\r\nSiberia. After running due north for about six hundred miles from the\r\nstrait, it turns suddenly to the east, pretty nearly following the same\r\nparallel as McClure\xe2\x80\x99s Passage, and probably doing much to keep that\r\ncommunication open for a few mouths in the warm season.\r\n\r\nThe other current, called Behring Current, flows just the other way.\r\nAfter running from east to west at about a hundred miles at the\r\nmost from the coast, it comes into collision, so to speak, with the\r\nKamtchatka Current at the opening of the strait, and turning to the\r\nsouth approaches the shores of Russian America, crosses Behring Sea,\r\nand finally breaks on the kind of circular dam formed by the Aleutian\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nHobson\xe2\x80\x99s map gave a very exact summary of the most recent nautical\r\nobservations, so that it could be relied on.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant examined it carefully before speaking, and then pressing\r\nhis hand to his head, as if oppressed by some sad presentiment, he\r\nobserved\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hope that fate will not take us to remote northern latitudes.\r\nOur wandering island would run a risk of never returning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Lieutenant?\xe2\x80\x9d broke in Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, madam?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9clook well at this part of the\r\nArctic Ocean, and you will readily understand why. Two currents, both\r\ndangerous for us, run opposite ways. When they meet, the island must\r\nnecessarily become stationary, and that at a great distance from any\r\nland. At that point it will have to remain for the winter, and when the\r\nnext thaw sets in, it will either follow the Kamtchatka Current to\r\nthe deserted regions of the north-west, or it will float down with the\r\nBehring Current to be swallowed up by the Pacific Ocean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will not happen, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge in a tone of earnest\r\nconviction; \xe2\x80\x9cGod would never permit that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cwhereabouts in the Polar\r\nSea we are at this moment; for I see but one current from the offing of\r\nCape Bathurst which bears directly to the north-west, and that is the\r\ndangerous Kamtchatka Current. Are you not afraid that it has us in\r\nits fatal embrace, and is carrying us with it to the shores of North\r\nGeorgia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is a very rapid current, madam; and if we had been\r\nfollowing it for three months, we should have had some land in sight by\r\nthis time, and there is none, absolutely none!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, then, do you suppose we are?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely between the Kamtchatka Current and the coast, perhaps in\r\nsome vast eddy unmarked upon the map.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cannot be, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, madam, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if Victoria Island were in an eddy, it would have veered\r\nround to a certain extent, and our position with regard to the cardinal\r\npoints would have changed in the last three months, which is certainly\r\nnot the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, madam, you are quite right. The only explanation I can\r\nthink of is, that there is some other current, not marked on our map.\r\nOh, that to morrow were here that I might find out our longitude; really\r\nthis uncertainty is terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow will come,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Madge.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but to wait. The party therefore separated,\r\nall returning to their ordinary occupations. Sergeant Long informed his\r\ncomrades that the departure for Fort Reliance, fixed for the next day,\r\nwas put off. He gave as reasons that the season was too far advanced\r\nto get to the southern factory before the great cold set in, that the\r\nastronomer was anxious to complete his meteorological observations, and\r\nwould therefore submit to another winter in the north, that game was so\r\nplentiful provisions from Fort Reliance were not needed. &c., &c. But\r\nabout all these matters the brave fellows cared little.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson ordered his men to spare the furred animals in future,\r\nand only to kill edible game, so as to lay up fresh stores for the\r\ncoming winter; he also forbade them to go more than two miles from the\r\nfort, not wishing Marbre and Sabine to come suddenly upon a sea-horizon,\r\nwhere the isthmus connecting the peninsula of Victoria with the mainland\r\nwas visible a few months before. The disappearance of the neck of land\r\nwould inevitably have betrayed everything.\r\n\r\nThe day appeared endless to Lieutenant Hobson. Again and again he\r\nreturned to Cape Bathurst either alone, or accompanied by Mrs Barnett.\r\nThe latter, inured to danger, showed no fear; she even joked the\r\nLieutenant about his floating island being perhaps, after all, the\r\nproper conveyance for going to the North Pole. \xe2\x80\x9cWith a favourable\r\ncurrent might they not reach that hitherto inaccessible point of the\r\nglobe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson shook his head as he listened to his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfancy, and kept his eyes fixed upon the horizon, hoping to catch a\r\nglimpse of some land, no matter what, in the distance. But no, sea and\r\nsky met in an absolutely unbroken circular line, confirming Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion that Victoria Island was drifting to the west rather than in any\r\nother direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d at last said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you mean to make\r\na tour of our island as soon as possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam, of course; as soon as I have taken our bearings, I mean\r\nto ascertain the form and extent of our dominions. It seems, however,\r\nthat the fracture was made at the isthmus itself, so that the whole\r\npeninsula has become an island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange destiny is ours, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett. \xe2\x80\x9cOthers\r\nreturn from their travels to add new districts to geographical maps, but\r\nwe shall have to efface the supposed peninsula of Victoria!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 18th, the sky was very clear, and at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nin the morning Hobson obtained a satisfactory altitude of the sun,\r\nand, comparing it with that of the observation of the day before, he\r\nascertained exactly the longitude in which they were.\r\n\r\nThe island was then in 157\xc2\xb0 37\xe2\x80\x99 longitude west from Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThe latitude obtained the day before at noon almost immediately after\r\nthe eclipse was, as we know, 73\xc2\xb0 7\xe2\x80\x99 20\xe2\x80\x9d north.\r\n\r\nThe spot was looked out on the map in the presence of Mrs Barnett and\r\nSergeant Long.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a most anxious moment, and the following result was\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nThe wandering island was moving in a westerly direction, borne along by\r\na current unmarked on the chart, and unknown to hydrographers, which was\r\nevidently carrying it towards Behring Strait. All the dangers foreseen\r\nby Hobson were then imminent, if Victoria Island did not again touch the\r\nmainland before the winter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how far are we from the American continent? that is the most\r\nimportant point just at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\nHobson took his compasses, and carefully measured the narrowest part of\r\nthe sea between the coast and the seventieth parallel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are actually more than two hundred and fifty miles from Point\r\nBarrow, the northernmost extremity of Russian America,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to know, then, how many miles the island has drifted since\r\nit left the mainland,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven hundred miles at least,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, after having again\r\nconsulted the chart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at about what time do you suppose the drifting commenced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely towards the end of April; the ice-field broke up then,\r\nand the icebergs which escaped melting drew back to the north. We may,\r\ntherefore, conclude that Victoria Island has been moving along with\r\nthe current parallel with the coast at an average rate of ten miles a\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo very rapid pace after all!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo fast, madam, when you think where we may be taken during the\r\ntwo months in which the sea will remain open in this part of the Arctic\r\nOcean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three friends remained silent, and looked fixedly at the chart of\r\nthe fearful Polar regions, towards which they were being irresistibly\r\ndrawn, and which have hitherto successfully resisted all attempts to\r\nexplore them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is, then, nothing to be done? Nothing to try?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs\r\nBarnett after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cnothing whatever. We must wait;\r\nwe must all pray for the speedy arrival of the Arctic winter generally\r\nso much dreaded by sailors, but which alone can save us now. The winter\r\nwill bring ice, our only anchor of salvation, the only power which can\r\narrest the course of this wandering island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. A TOUR OF THE ISLAND. From that day, July 18th, it was\r\ndecided that the bearings should be taken as on board a vessel whenever\r\nthe state of the atmosphere rendered the operation possible. Was not the\r\nisland, in fact, a disabled ship, tossed about without sails or helm.\r\n\r\nThe next day after taking the bearings, Hobson announced that without\r\nchange of latitude the island had advanced several miles farther west.\r\nMac-Nab was ordered to commence the construction of a huge boat, Hobson\r\ntelling him, in explanation, that he proposed making a reconnaissance of\r\nthe coast as far as Russian America next summer. The carpenter asked no\r\nfurther questions, but proceeded to choose his wood, and fixed upon the\r\nbeach at the foot of Cape Bathurst as his dockyard, so that he might\r\neasily be able to launch his vessel.\r\n\r\nHobson intended to set out the same day on his excursion round the\r\nisland in which he and his comrades were imprisoned. Many changes might\r\ntake place in the configuration of this sheet of ice, subject as it was\r\nto the influence of the variable temperature of the waves, and it was\r\nimportant to determine its actual form at the present time, its area,\r\nand its thickness in different parts. The point of rupture, which was\r\nmost likely at the isthmus itself, ought to be examined with special\r\ncare; the fracture being still fresh, it might be possible to ascertain\r\nthe exact arrangement of the stratified layers of ice and earth of which\r\nthe soil of the island was composed.\r\n\r\nBut in the afternoon the sky clouded over suddenly, and a violent\r\nsquall, accompanied with thick mists, swept down upon the fort.\r\nPresently torrents of rain fell, and large hailstones rattled on the\r\nroof, whilst a few distant claps of thunder were heard, a phenomenon of\r\nexceedingly rare occurrence in such elevated latitudes.\r\n\r\nHobson was obliged to put off his trip, and wait until the fury of the\r\nelements abated, but during the 20th, 2lst, and 22d July, no change\r\noccurred. The storm raged, the floods of heaven were let loose, and the\r\nwaves broke upon the beach with a deafening roar. Liquid avalanches were\r\nflung with such force upon Cape Bathurst, that there was reason to\r\ndread that it might give way; its stability was, in fact, somewhat\r\nproblematical, as it consisted merely of an aggregation of sand and\r\nearth, without any firm foundation. Vessels at sea might well be pitied\r\nin this fearful gale, but the floating island was of too vast a bulk to\r\nbe affected by the agitation of the waves, and remained indifferent to\r\ntheir fury.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 22d July the tempest suddenly ceased. A strong\r\nbreeze from the north-east dispelled the last mists upon the horizon.\r\nThe barometer rose a few degrees, and the weather appeared likely to\r\nfavour Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s expedition.\r\n\r\nHe was to be accompanied by Mrs Barnett and Sergeant Long, and expected\r\nto be absent a day or two. The little party took some salt meat,\r\nbiscuits, and a few flasks of rum with them, and there was nothing in\r\ntheir excursion to surprise the rest of the colonists. The days were\r\njust then very long, the sun only disappearing below the horizon for a\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\nThere were no wild animals to be feared now. The bears seemed to have\r\nfled by instinct from the peninsula whilst it was still connected with\r\nthe mainland, but to neglect no precaution each of the three explorers\r\nwas provided with a gun. The Lieutenant and his subordinate also carried\r\nhatchets and ice-chisels, which a traveller in the Polar regions should\r\nnever be without.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the Lieutenant and the Sergeant, the command of\r\nthe fort fell to Corporal Joliffe, or rather to his little wife, and\r\nHobson knew that he could trust her. Thomas Black could not be depended\r\non; he would not even join the exploring party; he promised, however,\r\nto watch the northern latitudes very carefully, and to note any change\r\nwhich should take place in the sea or the position of the cape during\r\nthe absence of the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett had endeavoured to reason with the unfortunate astronomer,\r\nbut he would listen to nothing. He felt that Nature had deceived him,\r\nand that he could never forgive her.\r\n\r\nAfter many a hearty farewell, the Lieutenant and his two companions left\r\nthe fort by the postern gate, and, turning to the west, followed the\r\nlengthened curve of the coast between Capes Bathurst and Esquimaux.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning; the oblique rays of the sun\r\nstruck upon the beach, and touched it with many a brilliant tint,\r\nthe angry billows of the sea were sinking to rest, and the birds,\r\nptarmigans, guillemots, puffins, and petrels, driven away by the storm,\r\nwere returning by thousands. Troops of ducks were hastening back to Lake\r\nBarnett, flying close, although they knew it not, to Mrs Joliffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaucepan. Polar hares, martens, musk rats, and ermines rose before the\r\ntravellers and fled at their approach, but not with any great appearance\r\nof haste or terror. The animals evidently felt drawn towards their old\r\nenemies by a common danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey know well enough that they are hemmed in by the sea and cannot\r\nquit the island,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all in the habit of seeking warmer climates in the south in\r\nthe winter, are they not?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam, but unless they are presently able to cross the\r\nice-field, they will have to remain prisoners like ourselves, and I am\r\nafraid the greater number will die of cold or hunger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope they will be good enough to supply us with food for a long\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d and I think it is very fortunate that\r\nthey had not the sense to run away before the rupture of the isthmus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe birds will, however, leave us?\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, madam, everything with wings will go, they can traverse long\r\ndistances without fatigue, and, more fortunate than ourselves, they will\r\nregain terra firma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould we not use them as messengers?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good idea, madam, a capital idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9cWe might\r\neasily catch some hundreds of these birds, and tie a paper round their\r\nnecks with our exact situation written upon it. John Ross in 1848 tried\r\nsimilar means to acquaint the survivors of the Franklin expedition with\r\nthe presence of his ships, the Enterprise and the Investigator in the\r\nPolar seas. He caught some hundreds of white foxes in traps, rivetted a\r\ncopper collar round the neck of each with all the necessary information\r\nengraved upon it, and then set them free in every direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps some of the messengers may have fallen into the hands of the\r\nshipwrecked wanderers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cI know that an old fox was taken by\r\nCaptain Hatteras during his voyage of discovery, wearing a collar half\r\nworn away and hidden beneath his thick white fur. What we cannot do with\r\nthe quadrupeds, we will do with the birds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChatting thus and laying plans for the future, the three explorers\r\ncontinued to follow the coast. They noticed no change; the abrupt cliffs\r\ncovered with earth and sand showed no signs of a recent alteration in\r\nthe extent of the island. It was, however, to be feared that the vast\r\nsheet of ice would be worn away at the base by the action of the warm\r\ncurrents, and on this point Hobson was naturally anxious.\r\n\r\nBy eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the eight miles between Capes\r\nBathurst and Esquimaux had been traversed. A few traces of the\r\nencampment of Kalumah\xe2\x80\x99s party still remained; of course the snow huts\r\nhad entirely disappeared, but some cinders and walrus bones marked the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe three explorers halted here for a short time, they intended to pass\r\nthe few short hours of the night at Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay, which they hoped\r\nto reach In a few hours. They breakfasted seated on a slightly rising\r\nground covered with a scanty and stunted herbage. Before their eyes lay\r\nthe ocean bounded by a clearly-defined sea-horizon, without a sail or an\r\niceberg to break the monotony of the vast expanse of water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you be very much surprised if some vessel came In sight now,\r\nLieutenant?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be very agreeably surprised, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not at all uncommon for whalers to come as far north as\r\nthis, especially now that the Arctic Ocean is frequented by whales and\r\nchacholots, but you must remember that it is the 23rd July, and the\r\nsummer is far advanced. The whole fleet of whaling vessels is probably\r\nnow in Gulf Kotzebue, at the entrance to the strait. Whalers shun the\r\nsudden changes in the Arctic Ocean, and with good reason. They dread\r\nbeing shut in the ice; and the icebergs, avalanches, and, ice-fields\r\nthey avoid, are the very things for which we earnestly pray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will come, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long; \xe2\x80\x9chave patience, in\r\nanother two months the waves will no longer break upon the shores of\r\nCape Esquimaux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCape Esquimaux!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Barnett with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThat name,\r\nlike those we gave to the other parts of the peninsula, may turn out\r\nunfortunate too. We have lost Port Barnett and Paulina River; who can\r\ntell whether Cape Esquimaux and Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay may not also disappear\r\nin time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey too will disappear, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cand after\r\nthem the whole of Victoria Island, for nothing now connects it with a\r\ncontinent, and it is doomed to destruction. This result is inevitable,\r\nand our choice of geographical names will be thrown away; but\r\nfortunately the Royal Society has not yet adopted them, and Sir Roderick\r\nMurchison will have nothing to efface on his maps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne name he will,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCape Bathurst,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, you are right. Cape Bathurst must now be removed from maps\r\nof the Polar regions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo hours\xe2\x80\x99 rest were all the explorers cared for, and at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nthey prepared to resume their journey.\r\n\r\nBefore starting Hobson once more looked round him from the summit of\r\nCape Esquimaux; but seeing nothing worthy of notice, he rejoined Mrs\r\nBarnett and Sergeant Long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have not forgotten the\r\nfamily of natives we met here last winter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I have always held dear little Kalumah in friendly\r\nremembrance. She promised to come and see us again at Fort Hope, but\r\nshe will not be able to do so. But why do you ask me about the natives\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I remember something to which, much to my regret, I did not\r\nat the time attach sufficient importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember the uneasy surprise the men manifested at finding a big\r\na factory at the foot of Cape Bathurst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember that I tried to make out what the natives meant, and\r\nthat I could not do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hobsou, \xe2\x80\x9cI know now why they shook their heads.\r\nFrom tradition, experience, or something, the Esquimaux knew what the\r\npeninsula really was, they knew we had not built on firm ground. But as\r\nthings had probably remained as they were for centuries, they thought\r\nthere was no immediate danger, and that it was not worth while to\r\nexplain themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I feel sure\r\nthat Kalumah had no suspicion of her companion\xe2\x80\x99s fears, or she would\r\nhave warned us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson quite agreed with Mrs Barnett, and Sergeant Long observed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt really seems to have been by a kind of fatality that we settled\r\nourselves upon this peninsula just before it was torn away from the\r\nmainland. I suppose, Lieutenant, that it had been connected for a very\r\nlong time, perhaps for centuries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might say for thousands and thousands of years, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember that the soil on which we are treading\r\nhas been brought here by the wind, little by little, that the sand has\r\naccumulated grain by grain! Think of the time it must have taken for the\r\nseeds of firs, willows, and arbutus to become shrubs and trees! Perhaps\r\nthe sheet of ice on which we float was welded to the continent before\r\nthe creation of man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Long, \xe2\x80\x9cit really might have waited a few centuries\r\nlonger before it drifted. How much anxiety and how many dangers we might\r\nthen have been spared!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Long\xe2\x80\x99s most sensible remark closed the conversation, and the\r\njourney was resumed.\r\n\r\nFrom Cape Esquimaux to Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay the coast ran almost due south,\r\nfollowing the one hundred and twenty-seventh meridian. Looking behind\r\nthem they could see one corner of the lagoon, its waters sparkling in\r\nthe sunbeams, and a little beyond the wooded heights in which it was\r\nframed. Large eagles soared above their heads, their cries and the loud\r\nflapping of their wings breaking the stillness, and furred animals\r\nof many kinds, martens, polecats, ermines, &c., crouching behind some\r\nrising ground, or hiding amongst the stunted bushes and willows, gazed\r\ninquiringly at the intruders. They seemed to understand that they had\r\nnothing to fear. Hobson caught a glimpse of a few beavers wandering\r\nabout, evidently ill at ease, and puzzled at the disappearance of the\r\nlittle river. With no ledges to shelter them, and no stream by which to\r\nbuild a new home, they were doomed to die of cold when the severe frost\r\nset in. Sergeant Long also saw a troop of wolves crossing the plain.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that specimens of the whole Arctic Fauna were imprisoned\r\non the island, and there was every reason to fear that, when famished\r\nwith hunger, all the carnivorous beasts would be formidable enemies to\r\nthe occupants of Fort Hope.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, one race of animals appeared to be quite\r\nunrepresented. Not a single white bear was seen! Once the Sergeant\r\nthought he saw an enormous white mass moving about on the other side\r\nof a clump of willows, but on close examination decided that he was\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nThe coast near Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay was, on the whole, only slightly elevated\r\nabove the sea-level, and in the distance the waves broke into running\r\nfoam as they do upon a sloping beach. It was to be feared that the\r\nsoil had little stability, but there was no means of judging of the\r\nmodifications which had taken place since their last visit, and Hobson\r\nmuch regretted that he had not made bench marks about Cape Bathurst\r\nbefore he left, that he might judge of the amount of sinking or\r\ndepression which took place. He determined, however, to take this\r\nprecaution on his return.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that, under the circumstances, the party did not\r\nadvance very rapidly. A pause was often made to examine the soil, or to\r\nsee if there were any sign of an approaching fracture on the coast, and\r\nsometimes the explorers wandered inland for half a mile. Here and there\r\nthe Sergeant planted branches of willow or birch to serve as landmarks\r\nfor the future, especially wherever undermining seemed to be going on\r\nrapidly and the solidity of the ground was doubtful. By this means it\r\nwould be easy to ascertain the changes which might take place.\r\n\r\nThey did advance, however, and at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon\r\nthey were only three miles from Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay, and Hobson called Mrs\r\nBarnett\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the important changes which had been effected\r\nby the rupture of the isthmus.\r\n\r\nFormerly the south-western horizon was shut in by a long slightly\r\ncurved coast-line, formed by the shores of Liverpool Bay. Now a sea-line\r\nbounded the view, the continent having disappeared. Victoria Island\r\nended in an abrupt angle where it had broken off, and all felt sure that\r\non turning round that angle the ocean would be spread out before them,\r\nand that its waves would bathe the whole of the southern side of the\r\nisland, which was once the connecting-link between Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay and\r\nWashburn Bay.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett could not look at the changed aspect of the scene without\r\nemotion. She had expected it, and yet her heart beat almost audibly.\r\nShe gazed across the sea for the missing continent, which was now left\r\nseveral hundred miles behind, and it rushed upon her mind with a fresh\r\nshock that she would never set foot on America again. Her agitation was\r\nindeed excusable, and it was shared by the Lieutenant and the Sergeant.\r\n\r\nAll quickened their steps, eager to reach the abrupt angle in the south.\r\nThe ground rose slightly as they advanced, and the layers of earth\r\nand sand became thicker; this of course was explained by the former\r\nproximity of this part of the coast to the true continent. The thickness\r\nof the crust of ice and of the layer of earth at the point of junction\r\nincreasing, as it probably did, every century, explained the long\r\nresistance of the isthmus, which nothing but some extraordinary\r\nconvulsion could have overcome. Such a convulsion was the earthquake of\r\nthe 8th January, which, although it had only affected the continent of\r\nNorth America, had sufficed to break the connecting-link, and to launch\r\nVictoria Island upon the wide ocean.\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M., the angle was reached. Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay, formed\r\nby an indentation of the firm ground, had disappeared! It had remained\r\nbehind with the continent\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith, madam!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for\r\nyou we didn\xe2\x80\x99t call it Paulina Barnett Bay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to think I am an unlucky\r\ngodmother for newly-discovered places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. A NIGHT ENCAMPMENT. And so Hobson had not been mistaken\r\nabout the point of rupture. It was the isthmus which had yielded in\r\nthe shock of the earthquake. Not a trace was to be seen of the American\r\ncontinent, not a single cliff, even the volcano on the west had\r\ndisappeared. Nothing but the sea everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe island on this side ended in a cape, coming to an almost sharp\r\npoint, and it was evident that the substratum of ice, fretted by\r\nthe warmer waters of the current and exposed to all the fury of the\r\nelements, must rapidly dissolve.\r\n\r\nThe explorers resumed their march, following the course of the fracture,\r\nwhich ran from west to east in an almost straight line. Its edges were\r\nnot jagged or broken, but clear cut, as if the division had been made\r\nwith a sharp instrument, and here and there the conformation of the soil\r\ncould be easily examined. The banks- half ice, half sand and earth-rose\r\nsome ten feet from the water. They were perfectly perpendicular, without\r\nthe slightest slope, and in some places there were traces of recent\r\nlandslips. Sergeant Long pointed to several small blocks of ice floating\r\nin the offing, and rapidly melting, which had evidently been broken off\r\nfrom their island. The action of the warm surf would, of course, soon\r\neat away the new coast-line, which time had not yet clothed with a kind\r\nof cement of snow and sand, such as covered the rest of the beach, and\r\naltogether the state of things was very far from reassuring.\r\n\r\nBefore taking any rest, Mrs Barnett, Hobson, and Long, were anxious to\r\nfinish their examination of the southern edge of the island. There would\r\nbe plenty of daylight, for the sun would not set until eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nP.M. The briliant orb of day was slowly advancing along the western\r\nhorizon, and its oblique rays cast long shadows of themselves before the\r\nexplorers, who conversed at intervals after long silent pauses, during\r\nwhich they gazed at the sea and thought of the dark future before them.\r\n\r\nHobson intended to encamp for the night at Washburn Bay. When there\r\neighteen miles would have been traversed, and, if he were not mistaken,\r\nhalf his circular journey would be accomplished. After a few hours\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrepose he meant to return to Fort Hope along the western coast.\r\n\r\nNo fresh incident marked the exploration of the short distance between\r\nWalruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay and Washburn Bay, and at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening\r\nthe spot chosen for the encampment was reached. A similar change had\r\ntaken place here. Of Washburn Bay, nothing remained but the curve\r\nformed by the coast-line of the island, and which was once its northern\r\nboundary. It stretched away without a break for seven miles to the cape\r\nthey had named Cape Michael. This side of the island did not appear to\r\nhave suffered at all in consequence of the rupture. The thickets of pine\r\nand birch, massed a little behind the cape, were in their fullest beauty\r\nat this time of year, and a good many furred animals were disporting\r\nthemselves on the plain.\r\n\r\nA halt was made at Washburn Bay, and the explorers were able to enjoy\r\nan extended view on the south, although they could not see any great\r\ndistance on the north. The sun was so low on the horizon, that its rays\r\nwere intercepted by the rising ground on the west, and did not reach\r\nthe little bay. It was not, however, yet night, nor could it be called\r\ntwilight, as the sun had not set.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long, \xe2\x80\x9cif by some miracle a bell were now to\r\nring, what do you suppose it would mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it was supper-time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you agree with\r\nme, Mrs Barnett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady addressed, \xe2\x80\x9cand as our cloth is\r\nspread for us, let us sit down. This moss, although slightly worn, will\r\nsuit us admirably, and was evidently intended for us by Providence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bag of provisions was opened; some salt meat, a hare pat\xc3\xa9 from Mrs\r\nJoliffe\xe2\x80\x99s larder, with a few biscuits, formed their frugal supper.\r\n\r\nThe meal was quickly over, and Hobson returned to the southwest angle of\r\nthe island, whilst Mrs Barnett rested at the foot of a low fir tree, and\r\nSergeant Long made ready the night quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant was anxious to examine the piece of ice which formed the\r\nisland, to ascertain, if possible, something of its structure. A little\r\nbank, produced by a landslip, enabled him to step down to the level of\r\nthe sea, and from there he was able to look closely at the steep wall\r\nwhich formed the coast. Where he stood the soil rose scarcely three feet\r\nabove the water. The upper part consisted of a thin layer of earth and\r\nsand mixed with crushed shells; and the lower of hard, compact, and, if\r\nwe may so express it, \xe2\x80\x9cmetallic\xe2\x80\x9d ice, strong enough to support the\r\nupper soil of the island.\r\n\r\nThis layer of ice was not more than one foot above the sea-level. In\r\nconsequence of the recent fracture, it was easy to see the regular\r\ndisposition of the sheets of ice piled up horizontally, and which had\r\nevidently been produced by successive frosts in comparatively quieter\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nWe know that freezing commences on the surface of liquids, and as\r\nthe cold increases, the thickness of the crust becomes greater, the\r\nsolidification proceeding from the top downwards. That at least is the\r\ncase in waters that are at rest; it has, however, been observed that\r\nthe very reverse is the case in running waters-the ice forming at the\r\nbottom, and subsequently rising to the surface.\r\n\r\nIt was evident, then, that the floe which formed the foundation of\r\nVictoria Island had been formed in calm waters on the shores of the\r\nNorth American continent. The freezing had evidently commenced on\r\nthe surface, and the thaw would begin at the bottom, according to a\r\nwell-known law; so that the ice-field would gradually decrease in weight\r\nas it became thawed by the warmer waters through which it was passing,\r\nand the general level of the island would sink in proportion.\r\n\r\nThis was the great danger.\r\n\r\nAs we have just stated, Hobson noticed that the solid ice, the ice-field\r\nproperly so called, was only about one foot above the sea-level! We know\r\nthat four-fifths of a floating mass of ice are always submerged. For one\r\nfoot of an iceberg or ice-field above the water, there are four below\r\nit. It must, however, be remarked that the density, or rather specific\r\nweight of floating ice, varies considerably according to its mode\r\nof formation or origin. The ice-masses which proceed from sea water,\r\nporous, opaque, and tinged with blue or green, according as they are\r\nstruck by the rays of the sun, are lighter than ice formed from fresh\r\nwater. All things considered, and making due allowance for the weight of\r\nthe mineral and vegetable layer above the ice. Hobson concluded it to\r\nbe about four or five feet thick below the sea-level. The different\r\ndeclivities of the island, the little hills and rising ground, would of\r\ncourse only affect the upper soil, and it might reasonably be supposed\r\nthat the wandering island was not immersed more than five feet.\r\n\r\nThis made Hobson very anxious. Only five feet! Setting aside the causes\r\nof dissolution to which the ice-field might be subjected, would not the\r\nslightest shock cause a rupture of the surface? Might not a rough sea or\r\na gale of wind cause a dislocation of the ice-field, which would lead to\r\nits breaking up into small portions, and to its final decomposition? Oh\r\nfor the speedy arrival of the winter, with its bitter cold! Would that\r\nthe column of mercury were frozen in its cistern! Nothing but the rigour\r\nof an Arctic winter could consolidate and thicken the foundation of\r\ntheir island, and establish a means of communication between it and the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nHobson returned to the halting-place little cheered by his discoveries,\r\nand found Long busy making arrangements for the night; for he had no\r\nidea of sleeping beneath the open sky, although Mrs Barnett declared\r\nherself quite ready to do so. He told the Lieutenant that he intended to\r\ndig a hole in the ice big enough to hold three persons\xe2\x80\x94in fact to make\r\na kind of snow-hut, in which they would be protected from the cold night\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the land of the Esquimaux,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing is wiser than to\r\ndo as the Esquimaux do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson approved, but advised the Sergeant not to dig too deeply, as the\r\nice was not more than five feet thick.\r\n\r\nLong set to work. With the aid of his hatchet and ice-chisel he had\r\nsoon cleared away the earth, and hollowed out a kind of passage sloping\r\ngently down to the crust of ice.\r\n\r\nHe next attacked the brittle mass, which had been covered over with sand\r\nand earth for so many centuries. It would not take more than an hour to\r\nhollow out a subterranean retreat, or rather a burrow with walls of\r\nice, which would keep in the heat, and therefore serve well for a\r\nresting-place during the short night.\r\n\r\nWhilst Long was working away like a white ant, Hobson communicated the\r\nresult of his observations to Mrs Barnett. He did not disguise from her\r\nthat the construction of Victoria Island rendered him very uneasy. He\r\nfelt sure that the thinness of the ice would lead to the opening of\r\nravines on the surface before long; where, it would be impossible to\r\nforesee, and of course it would be equally impossible to prevent them.\r\nThe wandering Island might at any moment settle down in consequence of\r\na change in its specific gravity, or break up into more or less numerous\r\nislets, the duration of which must necessarily be ephemeral. He judged,\r\ntherefore, that it would be best for the members of the colony to keep\r\ntogether as much as possible, and not to leave the fort, that they might\r\nall share the same chances.\r\n\r\nHobson was proceeding further to unfold his views when cries for help\r\nwere heard.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett started to her feet, and both looked round in every\r\ndirection, but nothing was to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe cries were now redoubled, and Hobson exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sergeant! the Sergeant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd followed by Mrs Barnett, he rushed towards the burrow, and he had\r\nscarcely reached the opening of the snow-house before he saw Sergeant\r\nLong clutching with both hands at his knife, which he had stuck in the\r\nwall of ice, and calling out loudly, although with the most perfect\r\nself-possession.\r\n\r\nHis head and arms alone were visible. Whilst he was digging, the ice had\r\ngiven way suddenly beneath him, and he was plunged into water up to his\r\nwaist.\r\n\r\nHobson merely said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep hold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd creeping through the passage, he was soon at the edge of the hole.\r\nThe poor Sergeant seized his hand, and he was soon rescued from his\r\nperilous position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! Sergeant!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long, shaking himself like a wet spaniel,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexcept that the ice gave way under me, and I took a compulsory\r\nbath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forgot what I told you about not digging too deeply, then,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg pardon, sir; I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t cut through fifteen inches of the ice,\r\nand I expect there was a kind of cavern where I was working-the ice\r\ndid not touch the water. It was just like going through a ceiling. If I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to hang on by my knife, I should have slipped under\r\nthe island like a fool, and that would have been a pity, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nmadam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very great pity, my brave fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, pressing his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nLong\xe2\x80\x99s explanation was correct; for some reason or another\xe2\x80\x94most\r\nlikely from an accumulation of air-the ice had formed a kind of vault\r\nabove the water, and of course it soon gave way under the weight of the\r\nSergeant and the blows of his chisel.\r\n\r\nThe same thing might happen in other parts of the island, which was\r\nanything but reassuring. Where could they be certain of treading on firm\r\nground? Might not the earth give way beneath their feet at any minute?\r\nWhat heart, however brave, would not have sunk at the thought of the\r\nthin partition between them and the awful gulf of the ocean?\r\n\r\nSergeant Long, however, thought but little of his bath, and was ready\r\nto begin mining in some other place. This Mrs Barnett would not allow.\r\nA night in the open air would do her no harm; the shelter of the coppice\r\nnear would be protection enough for them all; and Sergeant Long was\r\nobliged to submit.\r\n\r\nThe camp was, therefore, moved back some thirty yards from the beach,\r\nto a rising ground on which grew a few clumps of pines and willows which\r\ncould scarcely be called a wood. Towards ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the disc of the\r\nsun began to dip below the horizon, and before it disappeared for the\r\nfew hours of the night a crackling fire of dead branches was blazing at\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nLong had now a fine opportunity of drying his legs, of which he gladly\r\navailed himself. He and Hobson talked together earnestly until twilight\r\nset in, and Mrs Barnett occasionally joined in the conversation, doing\r\nthe best she could to cheer the disheartened Lieutenant. The sky was\r\nbright with stars, and the holy influence of the night could not fail\r\nto calm his troubled spirit. The wind murmured softly amongst the pines;\r\neven the sea appeared to be wrapt in slumber, its bosom slightly heaving\r\nwith the swell, which died away upon the beach with a faint rippling\r\nsound. All creation was hushed, not even the wail of a sea bird broke\r\nupon the ear, the crisp crackling of the dead branches was exchanged for\r\na steady flame, and nothing but the voices of the wanderers broke the\r\nsublime, the awful silence of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho would imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we were floating on\r\nthe surface of the ocean! It really requires an effort to realise it,\r\nfor the sea which is carrying us along in its fatal grasp appears to be\r\nabsolutely motionless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson;\xe2\x80\x9d and if the floor of our carriage\r\nwere solid, if I did not know that sooner or later the keel of our boat\r\nwill be missing, that some day its hull will burst open, and finally, if\r\nI knew where we are going, I should rather enjoy floating on the ocean\r\nlike this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9ccould there be a\r\npleasanter mode of travelling than ours? We feel no motion. Our island\r\nhas exactly the same speed as the current which is bearing it away. Is\r\nit not like a balloon voyage in the air? What could be more delightful\r\nthan advancing with one\xe2\x80\x99s house, garden, park, &c.? A wandering\r\nisland, with a solid insubmersible foundation, would really be the most\r\ncomfortable and wonderful conveyance that could possibly be imagined. I\r\nhave heard of hanging gardens. Perhaps some day floating parks will be\r\ninvented which will carry us all over the globe! Their size will render\r\nthem insensible to the action of the waves, they will have nothing\r\nto fear from storms, and perhaps with a favourable wind they might be\r\nguided by means of immense sails! What marvels of vegetation would be\r\nspread before the eyes of the passengers when they passed from temperate\r\nto torrid zones! With skilful pilots, well acquainted with the currents,\r\nit might be possible to remain in one latitude, and enjoy a perpetual\r\nspring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson could not help smiling at Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s fancies. The brave\r\nwoman ran on with such an easy flow of words, she talked with as little\r\neffort as Victoria Island moved. And was she not right? It would have\r\nbeen a very pleasant mode of travelling if there had been no danger of\r\ntheir conveyance melting and being swallowed up by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe night passed on, and the explorers slept a few hours. At daybreak\r\nthey breakfasted, and thoroughly enjoyed their meal. The warmth and\r\nrest had refreshed them, and they resumed their journey at about six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock A.M.\r\n\r\nFrom Cape Michael to the former Port Barnett the coast ran in an almost\r\nstraight line from south to north for about eleven miles. There was\r\nnothing worthy of note about it; the shores were low and pretty even all\r\nthe way, and seemed to have suffered no alteration since the breaking\r\nof the isthmus. Long, in obedience to the Lieutenant, made bench marks\r\nalong the beach, that any future change might be easily noted.\r\n\r\nHobson was naturally anxious to get back to Fort Hope the same day, and\r\nMrs Barnett was also eager to return to her friends. It was of course\r\ndesirable under the circumstances that the commanding officer should not\r\nbe long absent from the fort\r\n\r\nAll haste was therefore made, and by taking a short cut they arrived at\r\nnoon at the little promontory which formerly protected Port Barnett from\r\nthe east winds.\r\n\r\nIt was not more than eight miles from this point to Fort Hope, and\r\nbefore four o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M the shouts of Corporal Joliffe welcomed their\r\nreturn to the factory.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. FROM JULY 25TH TO AUGUST 20TH. Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s first care on his\r\nreturn to the fort, was to make inquiries of Thomas Black as to the\r\nsituation of the little colony. No change had taken place for the last\r\ntwenty-four hours, but, as subsequently appeared, the island had floated\r\none degree of latitude further south, whilst still retaining its motion\r\ntowards the west. It was now at the same distance from the equator as\r\nIcy Cape, a little promontory of western Alaska, and two hundred miles\r\nfrom the American coast. The speed of the current seemed to be less here\r\nthan in the eastern part of the Arctic Ocean, but the island continued\r\nto advance, and, much to Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance, towards the dreaded\r\nBehring Strait. It was now only the 24th July, and a current of average\r\nspeed would carry it in another month through the strait and into the\r\nheated waves of the Pacific, where it would melt \xe2\x80\x9clike a lump of sugar\r\nin a glass of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett acquainted Madge with the result of the exploration of the\r\nisland. She explained to her the arrangement of the layers of earth and\r\nice at the part where the isthmus had been broken off; told her that\r\nthe thickness of the ice below the sea level was estimated at five feet;\r\nrelated the accident to Sergeant Long\xe2\x80\x94in short, she made her fully\r\nunderstand the reasons there were to fear the breaking up or sinking of\r\nthe ice field.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the colony had, however, no suspicion of the truth; a\r\nfeeling of perfect security prevailed. It never occurred to any of the\r\nbrave fellows that Fort Hope was floating above an awful abyss, and\r\nthat the lives of all its inhabitants were in danger. All were in good\r\nhealth, the weather was fine, and the climate pleasant and bracing.\r\nThe baby Michael got on wonderfully; he was beginning to toddle about\r\nbetween the house and the palisade; and Corporal Joliffe, who was\r\nextremely fond of him, was already beginning to teach him to hold a\r\ngun, and to understand the first duties of a soldier. Oh, if Mrs Joliffe\r\nwould but present him with such a son! but, alas! the blessing of\r\nchildren, for which he and his wife prayed every day, was as yet denied\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the soldiers had plenty to do.\r\n\r\nMac-Nab and his men\xe2\x80\x94Petersen, Belcher, Garry, Pond, and Hope\xe2\x80\x94worked\r\nzealously at the construction of a boat, a difficult task, likely to\r\noccupy them for several months. But as their vessel would be of no use\r\nuntil next year after the thaw, they neglected none of their duties at\r\nthe factory on its account. Hobson let things go on as if the future of\r\nthe factory were not compromised, and persevered in keeping the men in\r\nignorance. This serious question was often discussed by the officer and\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cstaff,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs Barnett and Madge differed from their chief on\r\nthe subject. They thought it would be better to tell the whole truth;\r\nthe men were brave and energetic, not likely to yield to despair, and\r\nthe shock would not be great if they heard of it now, instead of only\r\nwhen their situation was so hopeless that it could not be concealed. But\r\nin spite of the justice of these remarks, Hobson would not yield, and\r\nhe was supported by Sergeant Long. Perhaps, after all, they were right;\r\nthey were both men of long experience, and knew the temper of their men.\r\n\r\nAnd so the work of provisioning and strengthening the fort proceeded.\r\nThe palisaded enceinte was repaired with new stakes, and made higher\r\nin many places, so that it really formed a very strong fortification.\r\nMac-Nab also put into execution, with his chief\xe2\x80\x99s approval, a plan he\r\nhad long had at heart. At the corners abutting on the lake he built two\r\nlittle pointed sentry-boxes, which completed the defences; and Corporal\r\nJoliffe anticipated with delight the time when he should be sent to\r\nrelieve guard: he felt that they gave a military look to the buildings,\r\nand made them really imposing.\r\n\r\nThe palisade was now completely finished, and Mac-Nab, remembering the\r\nsufferings of the last winter, built a new wood shed close up against\r\nthe house itself, with a door of communication inside, so that there\r\nwould be no need to go outside at all. By this contrivance the fuel\r\nwould always be ready to hand. On the left side of the house, opposite\r\nthe shed, Mac-Nab constructed a large sleeping-room for the soldiers, so\r\nthat the camp-bed could be removed from the common room. This room\r\nwas also to be used for meals, and work. The three married couples had\r\nprivate rooms walled off, so that the large house was relieved of them\r\nas well as of all the other soldiers. A magazine for furs only was also\r\nerected behind the house near the powder-magazine, leaving the loft free\r\nfor stores; and the rafters and ribs of the latter were bound with iron\r\ncramps, that they might be able to resist all attacks. Mac-Nab also\r\nintended to build a little wooden chapel, which had been included in\r\nHobson\xe2\x80\x99s original plan of the factory; but its erection was put off\r\nuntil the next summer.\r\n\r\nWith what eager interest would the Lieutenant have once watched the\r\nprogress of his establishment! Had he been building on firm ground,\r\nwith what delight would he have watched the houses, sheds, and magazines\r\nrising around him! He remembered the scheme of crowning Cape Bathurst\r\nwith a redoubt for the protection of Fort Hope with a sigh. The very\r\nname of the factory, \xe2\x80\x9cFort Hope,\xe2\x80\x9d made his heart sink within him;\r\nfor should it not more truly be called \xe2\x80\x9cFort Despair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese various works took up the whole summer, and there was no time for\r\nennui. The construction of the boat proceeded rapidly. Mac-Nab meant it\r\nto be of about thirty tons measurement, which would make it large\r\nenough to carry some twenty passengers several hundred miles in the fine\r\nseason. The carpenter had been fortunate enough to find some bent pieces\r\nof wood, so that he was able quickly to form the first ribs of the\r\nvessel, and soon the stern and sternpost, fixed to the keel, were upon\r\nthe dockyard at the foot of Cape Bathurst.\r\n\r\nWhilst the carpenters were busy with hatchets, saws, and adzes, the\r\nhunters were eagerly hunting the reindeer and Polar hares, which\r\nabounded near the fort. The Lieutenant, however, told Marbre and Sabine\r\nnot to go far away, stating as a reason, that until the buildings were\r\ncompleted he did not wish to attract the notice of rivals. The truth\r\nwas, he did not wish the changes which had taken place to be noticed.\r\n\r\nOne day Marbre inquired if it was not now time to go to Walruses\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBay, and get a fresh supply of morse-oil for burning, and Hobson replied\r\nrather hastily\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Marbre; it would be useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant knew only too well that Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay was two hundred\r\nmiles away, and that there were no morses to be hunted on the island.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Hobson considered the situation desperate\r\neven now. He often assured Mrs Barnett, Madge, and Long that he was\r\nconvinced the island would hold together until the bitter cold of winter\r\nshould thicken its foundation and arrest its course at one and the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAfter his journey of discovery, Hobson estimated exactly the area of\r\nhis new dominions. The island measured more than forty miles round, from\r\nwhich its superficial area[r] would appear to be about one hundred and\r\nforty miles at the least. By way of comparison, we may say that Victoria\r\nIsland was rather larger than St Helena, and its area was about the same\r\nas that of Paris within the line of fortifications. If then it should\r\nbreak up into fragments, the separate parts might still be of sufficient\r\nsize to be habitable for some time.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Barnett expressed her surprise that a floating ice-field could\r\nbe so large, Hobson replied by reminding her of the observations of\r\nArctic navigators. Parry, Penny, and Franklin had met with ice-fields\r\nin the Polar seas one hundred miles long and fifty broad. Captain Kellet\r\nabandoned his boat on an ice-field measuring at least three hundred\r\nsquare miles, and what was Victoria Island compared to it?\r\n\r\nIts size was, however, sufficient to justify a hope that it would resist\r\nthe action of the warm currents until the cold weather set in. Hobson\r\nwould not allow himself to doubt; his despair arose rather from the\r\nknowledge that the fruit of all his cares, anxieties, and dangers must\r\neventually be swallowed up by the deep, and it was no wonder that he\r\ncould take no interest in the works that were going on.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett kept up a good heart through it all; she encouraged her\r\ncomrades in their work, and took her share in it, as if she had still a\r\nfuture to look forward to. Seeing what an interest Mrs Joliffe took in\r\nher plants, she joined her every day in the garden. There was now a fine\r\ncrop of sorrel and scurvy-grass\xe2\x80\x94thanks to the Corporal\xe2\x80\x99s unwearying\r\nexertions to keep off the birds of every kind, which congregated by\r\nhundreds.\r\n\r\nThe taming of the reindeer had been quite successful; there were now a\r\ngood many young, and little Michael had been partly brought up on the\r\nmilk of the mothers. There were now some thirty head in the herd which\r\ngrazed near the fort, and a supply of the herbage on which they feed was\r\ndried and laid up for the winter. These useful animals, which are easily\r\ndomesticated, were already quite familiar with all the colonists, and\r\ndid not go far from the enceinte. Some of them were used in sledges to\r\ncarry timber backwards and forwards. A good many reindeer, still wild,\r\nnow fell into the trap half way between the fort and Port Barnett. It\r\nwill be remembered that a large bear was once taken in it; but nothing\r\nof the kind occurred this season\xe2\x80\x94none fell victims but the reindeer,\r\nwhose flesh was salted and laid by for future use. Twenty at least were\r\ntaken, which in the ordinary course of things would have gone down to\r\nthe south in the winter.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, the reindeer-trap suddenly became useless in\r\nconsequence of the conformation of the soil. After visiting it as usual,\r\nthe hunter Marbre approached Hobson, and said to him in a significant\r\ntone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just paid my daily visit to the reindeer-trap, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Marbre, I hope you have been as successful to-day as yesterday,\r\nand have caught a couple of reindeer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Marbre, with some embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour trap has not yielded its ordinary contingent then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; and if any animal had fallen in, it would certainly have\r\nbeen drowned!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrowned!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Lieutenant, looking at the hunter with an\r\nanxious expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Marbre, looking attentively at his superior,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe pit is full of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, in the tone of a man who attached no importance\r\nto that, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know your pit was partly hollowed out of ice; its walls\r\nhave melted with the heat of the sun, and then \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg pardon for interrupting you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marbre; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nwater cannot have been produced by the melting of ice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, Marbre?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBecause if it came from ice it would be sweet,\r\nas you explained to me once before. Now the water in our pit is salt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster of himself as he was, Hobson could not help changing countenance\r\nslightly, and he had not a word to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d added Marbre, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to sound the trench, to see how\r\ndeep the water was, and to my great surprise, I can tell you, I could\r\nnot find the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Marbre,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing\r\nso wonderful in that. Some fracture of the soil has established a\r\ncommunication between the sea and the trap. So don\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy about\r\nit, my brave fellow, but leave the trap alone for the present, and be\r\ncontent with setting snares near the fort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarbre touched his cap respectfully, and turned on his heel, but not\r\nbefore he had given his chief a searching glance.\r\n\r\nHobson remained very thoughtful for a few moments. Marbre\xe2\x80\x99s tidings\r\nwere of grave importance. It was evident that the bottom of the trench,\r\ngradually melted by the warm waters of the sea, had given way.\r\n\r\nHobson at once called the Sergeant, and having acquainted him with the\r\nincident, they went together, unnoticed by their companions, to the\r\nbeach at the foot of Cape Bathurst, where they had made the bench-marks.\r\n\r\nThey examined them carefully, and found that since they last did so, the\r\nfloating island had sunk six inches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are sinking gradually,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Sergeant Long. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ice is\r\nwearing away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for the winter! the winter!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson, stamping his foot\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\nBut as yet, alas! there was no sign of the approach of the cold season.\r\nThe thermometer maintained a mean height of 59\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit, and during\r\nthe few hours of the night the column of mercury scarcely went down\r\nthree degrees.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the approaching winter went on apace, and there\r\nwas really nothing wanting to Fort Hope, although it had not been\r\nrevictualled by Captain Craventy\xe2\x80\x99s detachment. The long hours of the\r\nArctic night might be awaited in perfect security. The stores were of\r\ncourse carefully husbanded. There still remained plenty of spirits, only\r\nsmall quantities having been consumed; and there was a good stock of\r\nbiscuits, which, once gone, could not be replaced. Fresh venison and\r\nsalt meat were to be had in abundance, and with some antiscorbutic\r\nvegetables, the diet was most healthy; and all the members of the little\r\ncolony were well.\r\n\r\nA good deal of timber was cut in the woods clothing the eastern slopes\r\nof Lake Barnett. Many were the birch-trees, pines, and firs which fell\r\nbeneath the axe of Mac-Nab, and were dragged to the house by the tamed\r\nreindeer. The carpenter did not spare the little forest, although he cut\r\nhis wood judiciously; for he never dreamt that timber might fail him,\r\nimagining, as he did, Victoria Island to be a peninsula, and knowing the\r\ndistricts near Cape Michael to be rich in different species of trees.\r\n\r\nMany a time did the unconscious carpenter congratulate his Lieutenant on\r\nhaving chosen a spot so favoured by Heaven. Woods, game, furred animals,\r\na lagoon teeming with fish, plenty of herbs for the animals, and, as\r\nCorporal Joliffe would have added, double pay for the men. Was not Cape\r\nBathurst a corner of a privileged land, the like of which was not to\r\nbe found in the whole Arctic regions? Truly Hobson was a favourite\r\nof Heaven, and ought to return thanks to Providence every day for the\r\ndiscovery of this unique spot.\r\n\r\nAh, Mac-Nab, you little knew how you wrung the heart of your master when\r\nyou talked in that strain!\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of winter garments was not neglected in the factory. Mrs\r\nBarnett, Madge, Mrs Mac-Nab, Mrs Rae, and Mrs Joliffe\xe2\x80\x94when she could\r\nleave her fires\xe2\x80\x94were alike indefatigable. Mrs Barnett knew that\r\nthey would all have to leave the fort in the depth of winter, and was\r\ndetermined that every one should be warmly clothed. They would have to\r\nface the bitterest cold for a good many days during the Polar night, if\r\nVictoria Island should halt far from the continent. Boots and clothes\r\nought indeed to be strong and well made, for crossing some hundreds of\r\nmiles under such circumstances. Mrs Barnett and Madge devoted all their\r\nenergies to the matter in hand, and the furs, which they knew it would\r\nbe impossible to save, were turned to good account. They were used\r\ndouble, so that the soft hair was both inside and outside of the\r\nclothes; and when wearing them, the whole party would be as richly\r\nattired as the grandest princesses, or the most wealthy ladies. Those\r\nnot in the secret were rather surprised at the free use made of the\r\nCompany\xe2\x80\x99s property; but Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s authority was not to be questioned,\r\nand really martens, polecats, musk-rats, beavers, and foxes multiplied\r\nwith such rapidity near the fort, that all the furs used could easily\r\nbe replaced by a few shots, or the setting of a few traps; and when Mrs\r\nMac-Nab saw the beautiful ermine coat which had been made for her baby,\r\nher delight was unbounded, and she no longer wondered at anything.\r\n\r\nSo passed the days until the middle of the month of August. The weather\r\ncontinued fine, and any mists which gathered on the horizon were quickly\r\ndispersed by the sunbeams.\r\n\r\nEvery day Hobson took the bearings, taking care, however, to go some\r\ndistance from the fort, that suspicions might not be aroused, and he\r\nalso visited different parts of the island, and was reassured by finding\r\nthat no important changes appeared to be taking place.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th August Victoria Island was situated in 167\xc2\xb0 27\xe2\x80\x99 west\r\nlongitude, and 70\xc2\xb0 49\xe2\x80\x99 north latitude. It had, therefore, drifted\r\nslightly to the south, but without getting any nearer to the American\r\ncoast, which curved considerably.\r\n\r\nThe distance traversed by the island since the fracture of the isthmus,\r\nor rather since the last thaw, could not be less than eleven or twelve\r\nhundred miles to the west.\r\n\r\nBut what was this distance compared to the vast extent of the ocean?\r\nHad not boats been known to be drifted several thousands of miles by\r\ncurrents? Was not this the case with the English ship Resolute, the\r\nAmerican brig Advance, and with the Fox, all of which were carried along\r\nupon ice-fields until the winter arrested their advance?\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. TEN DAYS OF TEMPEST From the 17th to the 20th August the\r\nweather continued fine, and the temperature moderate. The mists on the\r\nhorizon were not resolved into clouds, and altogether the weather\r\nwas exceptionally beautiful for such an elevated position. It will be\r\nreadily understood, however, that Hobson could take no pleasure in the\r\nfineness of the climate.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st August, however, the barometer gave notice of an approaching\r\nchange. The column of mercury suddenly fell considerably, the sun was\r\ncompletely hidden at the moment of culmination, and Hobson was unable to\r\ntake his bearings.\r\n\r\nThe next day the wind changed and blew strongly from the north-west,\r\ntorrents of rain falling at intervals. Meanwhile, however, the\r\ntemperature did not change to any sensible extent, the thermometer\r\nremaining at 54\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nFortunately the proposed works were now all finished, and MacNab had\r\ncompleted the carcass of his boat, which was planked and ribbed. Hunting\r\nmight now be neglected a little, as the stores were complete, which was\r\nfortunate, for the weather became very bad. The wind was high, the\r\nrain incessant, and thick fogs rendered it impossible to go beyond the\r\nenceinte of the fort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of this change in the weather, Lieutenant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired Mrs Barnett on the morning of the 27th August; \xe2\x80\x9cmight it not\r\nbe in our favour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not like to be sure of it, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nanything is better for us than the magnificent weather we have lately\r\nhad, during which the sun made the waters warmer and warmer. Then, too,\r\nthe wind from the north-west is so very strong that it may perhaps drive\r\nus nearer to the American continent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Long, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can\xe2\x80\x99t take our bearings\r\nevery day now. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to see either sun, moon, or stars in\r\nthis fog. Fancy attempting to take an altitude now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see well enough to recognise America, if we get anywhere\r\nnear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever land we approach will be\r\nwelcome. It will most likely be some part of Russian America\xe2\x80\x94probably\r\nWestern Alaska.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, unfortunately, in the\r\nwhole Arctic Ocean there is not an island, an islet, or even a rock to\r\nwhich we could fasten our vessel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should not our conveyance take\r\nus straight to the coasts of Asia? Might not the currents carry us past\r\nthe opening of Bearing Strait and land us on the shores of Siberia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9cour ice-field would soon meet\r\nthe Kamtchatka current, and be carried by it to the northwest. It is\r\nmore likely, however, that this wind will drive us towards the shores of\r\nRussian America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must keep watch, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cand ascertain our\r\nposition as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall indeed keep watch,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9calthough this fog\r\nis very much against us If we should be driven on to the coast, the\r\nshock will be felt even if we cannot see. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope the island will\r\nnot fall to pieces in this storm! That is at present our principal\r\ndanger. Well, when it comes we shall see what there is to be done, and\r\nmeanwhile we must wait patiently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course this conversation was not held in the public room, where the\r\nsoldiers and women worked together. It was in her own room, with the\r\nwindow looking out on the court, that Mrs Barnett received visitors. It\r\nwas almost impossible to see indoors even in the daytime, and the wind\r\ncould be heard rushing by outside like an avalanche. Fortunately, Cape\r\nBathurst protected the house from the north-east winds, but the sand and\r\nearth from its summit were hurled down upon the roof with a noise like\r\nthe pattering of hail. Mac-Nab began to feel fresh uneasiness about his\r\nchimneys, which it was absolutely necessary to keep in good order. With\r\nthe roaring of the wind was mingled that of the sea, as its huge waves\r\nbroke upon the beach. The storm had become a hurricane.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fury of the gale, Hobson determined on the morning of\r\nthe 28th of August to climb to the summit of Cape Bathurst, in order\r\nto examine the state of the horizon, the sea, and the sky. He therefore\r\nwrapped himself up, taking care to have nothing about him likely to give\r\nhold the wind, and set out.\r\n\r\nHe got to the foot of the cape without much difficulty. The sand and\r\nearth blinded him, it is true, but protected by the cliff he had not\r\nas yet actually faced the wind. The fatigue began when he attempted to\r\nclimb the almost perpendicular sides of the promontory; but by clutching\r\nat the tufts of herbs with which they were covered, he managed to get to\r\nthe top, but there the fury of the gale was such that he could neither\r\nremain standing nor seated; he was therefore forced to fling himself\r\nupon his face behind the little coppice and cling to some shrubs, only\r\nraising his head and shoulders above the ground.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of sea and sky was indeed terrible. The spray dashed over\r\nthe Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s head, and half-a-mile from the cape water and clouds\r\nwere confounded together in a thick mist. Low jagged rain-clouds were\r\nchased along the heavens with giddy rapidity, and heavy masses of vapour\r\nwere piled upon the zenith. Every now and then an awful stillness fell\r\nupon the land, and the only sounds were the breaking of the surf upon\r\nthe beach and the roaring of the angry billows; but then the tempest\r\nrecommenced with redoubled fury, and Hobson felt the cape tremble to its\r\nfoundations. Sometimes the rain poured down with such violence that it\r\nresembled grape-shot.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a terrible hurricane from the very worst quarter of the\r\nheavens. This north-east wind might blow for a long time and cause all\r\nmanner of havoc. Yet Hobson, who would generally have grieved over\r\nthe destruction around him, did not complain,\xe2\x80\x94on the contrary, he\r\nrejoiced; for if, as he hoped, the island held together, it must be\r\ndriven to the south-west by this wind, so much more powerful than the\r\ncurrents. And the south-west meant land\xe2\x80\x94hope\xe2\x80\x94safety! Yes, for his\r\nown sake, and for that of all with him, he hoped that the hurricane\r\nwould last until it had flung them upon the laud, no matter where. That\r\nwhich would have been fatal to a ship was the best thing that could\r\nhappen to the floating island.\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of an hour Hobson remained crouching upon the ground,\r\nclutching at the shrubs like a drowning man at a spar, lashed by the\r\nwind, drenched by the rain and the spray, struggling to estimate all the\r\nchances of safety the storm might afford him. At the end of that time he\r\nlet himself slide down the cape, and fought his way to Fort Hope.\r\n\r\nHobson\xe2\x80\x99s first care was to tell his comrades that the hurricane was\r\nnot yet at its height, and that it would probably last a long time yet.\r\nHe announced these tidings with the manner of one bringing good news,\r\nand every one looked at him in astonishment. Their chief officer really\r\nseemed to take a delight in the fury of the elements.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th Hobson again braved the tempest, not this time climbing the\r\ncape, but going down to the beach. What was his joy at noticing some\r\nlong weeds floating on the top of the waves, of a kind which did not\r\ngrow on Victoria Island. Christopher Columbus\xe2\x80\x99 delight was not greater\r\nwhen he saw the sea-weed which told him of the proximity of land.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant hurried back to the fort, and told Mrs Barnett and\r\nSergeant Long of his discovery. He had a good mind to tell every one the\r\nwhole truth now, but a strange presentiment kept him silent.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the fort had plenty to amuse them in the long days of\r\ncompulsory confinement. They went on improving the inside of the various\r\nbuildings, and dug trenches in the court to carry away the rain-water.\r\nMac-Nab, a hammer in one hand and a nail in the other, was always busy\r\nat a job in some corner or another, and nobody took much note of the\r\ntempest outside in the daytime; but at night it was impossible to sleep,\r\nthe wind beat upon the buildings like a battering-ram; between the\r\nhouse and the cape sometimes whirled a huge waterspout of extraordinary\r\ndimensions; the planks cracked, the beams seemed about to separate, and\r\nthere was danger of the whole structure tumbling down. Mac-Nab and his\r\nmen lived in a state of perpetual dread, and had to be continually on\r\nthe watch.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hobson was uneasy about the stability of the island itself,\r\nrather than that of the house upon it. The tempest became so violent,\r\nand the sea so rough, that there was really a danger of the dislocation\r\nof the ice-field. It seemed impossible for it to resist much longer,\r\ndiminished as it was in thickness and subject to the perpetual action of\r\nthe waves. It is true that its inhabitants did not feel any motion, on\r\naccount of its vast extent, but it suffered from it none the less. The\r\npoint at issue was simply:\xe2\x80\x94Would the island last until it was flung\r\nupon the coast, or would it fall to pieces before it touched firm\r\nground?\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt that thus far it had resisted. As the Lieutenant\r\nexplained to Mrs Barnett, had it already been broken, had the ice-field\r\nalready divided into a number of islets, the occupants of the fort must\r\nhave noticed it, for the different pieces would have been small enough\r\nto be affected by the motion of the sea, and the people on any one of\r\nthem would have been pitched about like passengers on a boat. This\r\nwas not the case, and in his daily observations Lieutenant Hobson had\r\nnoticed no movement whatever, not so much as a trembling of the island,\r\nwhich appeared as firm and motionless as when it was still connected by\r\nits isthmus with the mainland.\r\n\r\nBut the breaking up, which had not yet taken place, might happen at any\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nHobson was most anxious to ascertain whether Victoria Island, driven by\r\nthe north-west wind out of the current, had approached the continent.\r\nEverything, in fact, depended upon this, which was their last chance\r\nof safety. But without sun, moon, or stars, instruments were of course\r\nuseless, as no observations could be taken, and the exact position of\r\nthe island could not be determined. If, then, they were approaching\r\nthe land, they would only know it when the land came in sight, and\r\nHobson\xe2\x80\x99s only means of ascertaining anything in time to be of any\r\nservice, was to get to the south of his dangerous dominions. The\r\nposition of Victoria Island with regard to the cardinal points had not\r\nsensibly altered all the time. Cape Bathurst still pointed to the\r\nnorth, as it did when it was the advanced post of North America. It was,\r\ntherefore, evident that if Victoria Island should come alongside of the\r\ncontinent, it would touch it with its southern side,\xe2\x80\x94the communication\r\nwould, in a word, be re-established by means of the broken isthmus;\r\nit was, therefore, imperative to ascertain what was going on in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHobson determined to go to Cape Michael, however terrible the storm\r\nmight be, but he meant to keep the real motive of his reconnaissance a\r\nsecret from his companions. Sergeant Long was to accompany him.\r\n\r\nAbout four o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M., on the 31st August, Hobson sent for the\r\nSergeant in his own room, that they might arrange together for all\r\neventualities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Long,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cit is necessary that we should,\r\nwithout delay, ascertain the position of Victoria Island, and above\r\nall whether this wind has, as I hope, driven it near to the American\r\ncontinent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree with you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long, \xe2\x80\x9cand the sooner we\r\nfind out the better\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it will necessitate our going down to the south of the island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, Sergeant, that you are always ready to do your duty, but you\r\nwill not go alone. Two of us ought to go, that we may be able to let our\r\ncomrades know if any land is in sight; and besides I must see for myself\r\n... we will go together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you like, Lieutenant, just when you think best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will start this evening at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when everybody else has\r\ngone to bed\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they would all want to come with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\r\nmust not know why we go so far from the factory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they must not know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cand if I can, I will\r\nkeep the knowledge of our awful situation from them until the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is agreed then, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You will take a tinder-box and some touchwood [Footnote: A\r\nfungus used as tinder (Polyporous igniarius).] with you, so that we\r\ncan make a signal if necessary\xe2\x80\x94if land is in sight in the south, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have a rough journey, Sergeant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter, sir, but by the way\xe2\x80\x94the lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall tell her. She would want to go with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she could not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9ca woman could not battle\r\nwith such a gale. Just see how its fury is increasing at this moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed the house was rocking to such an extent that it seemed likely to\r\nbe torn from its foundations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9ccourageous as she is, she could not, she ought\r\nnot to accompany us. But on second thought, it will be best to tell her\r\nof our project. She ought to know in case any accident should befall\r\nus\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long, \xe2\x80\x9cwe ought not to keep anything from her, and\r\nif we do not come back\xe2\x80\x9d....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock then, Sergeant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with a military salute Sergeant Long retired.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Hobson was telling Mrs Barnett of his scheme. As\r\nhe expected the brave woman insisted on accompanying him, and was quite\r\nready to face the tempest. Hobson did not dissuade her by dwelling on\r\nthe dangers of the expedition, he merely said that her presence was\r\nnecessary at the fort during his absence, and that her remaining would\r\nset his mind at ease. If any accident happened to him it would be a\r\ncomfort to know that she would take his place.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett understood and said no more about going; but only urged\r\nHobson not to risk himself unnecessarily. To remember that he was the\r\nchief officer, that his life was not his own, but necessary to the\r\nsafety of all. The Lieutenant promised to be as prudent as possible; but\r\nadded that the examination of the south of the island must be made at\r\nonce, and he would make it. The next day Mrs Barnett merely told her\r\ncompanions that the Lieutenant and the Sergeant had gone to make a final\r\nreconnaissance before the winter set in.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. A FIRE AND A CRY. The Lieutenant and the Sergeant spent the\r\nevening in the large room of the fort, where all were assembled except\r\nthe astronomer, who still remained shut up in his cabin. The men were\r\nbusy over their various occupations, some cleaning their arms, others\r\nmending or sharpening their tools. The women were stitching away\r\nindustriously, and Mrs Paulina Barnett was reading aloud; but she was\r\noften interrupted not only by the noise of the wind, which shook the\r\nwalls of the house like a battering-ram, but by the cries of the baby.\r\nCorporal Joliffe, who had undertaken to amuse him, had enough to do. The\r\nyoung gentleman had ridden upon his playmate\xe2\x80\x99s knees until they were\r\nworn out, and the Corporal at last put the indefatigable little cavalier\r\non the large table, where he rolled about to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content until\r\nhe fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock prayers were read as usual, the lamps were\r\nextinguished, and all retired to rest.\r\n\r\nWhen every one was asleep, Hobson and Long crept cautiously across the\r\nlarge room and gained the passage, where they found Mrs Barnett, who\r\nwished to press their hands once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow, madam, without fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you are delayed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must wait patiently for us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nif in examining the southern horizon we should see a fire, which is not\r\nunlikely this dark night, we should know that we were near the coasts\r\nof New Georgia, and then it would be desirable for me to ascertain our\r\nposition by daylight. In fact, we may be away forty eight hours. If,\r\nhowever, we can get to Cape Michael before midnight, we shall be back at\r\nthe fort to-morrow evening. So wait patiently, madam, and believe that\r\nwe shall incur no unnecessary risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d added the lady, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t get back to morrow,\r\nsuppose you are away more than two days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we shall not return at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson simply.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened, Mrs Barnett closed it behind the Lieutenant and\r\nhis companion and went back to her own room, where Madge awaited her,\r\nfeeling anxious and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nHobson and Long made their way across the inner court through a\r\nwhirlwind which nearly knocked them down; but clinging to each other,\r\nand leaning on their iron-bound staffs, they reached the postern gates,\r\nand set out [beween] between the hills and the eastern bank of the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nA faint twilight enabled them to see their way. The moon, which was\r\nnew the night before, would not appear above the horizon, and there was\r\nnothing to lessen the gloom of the darkness, which would, however, last\r\nbut a few hours longer.\r\n\r\nThe wind and rain were as violent as ever. The Lieutenant and his\r\ncompanion wore impervious boots and water-proof cloaks well pulled in at\r\nthe waist, and the hood completely covering their heads. Thus protected\r\nthey got along at a rapid pace, for the wind was behind them, and\r\nsometimes drove them on rather faster than they cared to go. Talking was\r\nquite out of the question, and they did not attempt it, for they were\r\ndeafened by the hurricane, and out of breath with the buffeting they\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nHobson did not mean to follow the coast, the windings of which would\r\nhave taken him a long way round, and have brought him face to face with\r\nthe wind, which swept over the sea with nothing to break its fury. His\r\nidea was to cut across in a straight line from Cape Bathurst to Cape\r\nMichael, and he was provided with a pocket compass with which to\r\nascertain his bearings. He hoped by this means to cross the ten or\r\neleven miles between him and his goal, just before the twilight faded\r\nand gave place to the two hours of real darkness.\r\n\r\nBent almost double, with rounded shoulders and stooping heads, the two\r\npressed on. As long as they kept near the lake they did not meet the\r\ngale full face, the little hills crowned with trees afforded them some\r\nprotection, the wind howled fearfully as it bent and distorted the\r\nbranches, almost tearing the trunks up by the roots; but it partly\r\nexhausted its strength, and even the rain when it reached the explorers\r\nwas converted into impalpable mist, so that for about four miles they\r\ndid not suffer half as much as they expected to.\r\n\r\nBut when they reached the southern skirts of the wood, where the hills\r\ndisappeared, and there were neither trees nor rising ground, the wind\r\nswept along with awful force, and involuntarily they paused for a\r\nmoment. They were still six miles from Cape Michael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have a bad time of it,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Lieutenant Hobson\r\nin the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the wind and rain will conspire to give us a good beating,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that now and then we shall have hail as well,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nHobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be as deadly as grape-shot,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwe have both been through that, and so forwards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForwards, my brave comrade!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The twilight was fading away, dying as if\r\ndrowned in the mists or quenched by the wind and the rain. There was\r\nstill, however, some light, and the Lieutenant struck his flint, and\r\nconsulted his compass, passing a piece of burning touchwood over it, and\r\nthen, drawing his cloak more closely around him, he plunged after the\r\nSergeant across the unprotected plain.\r\n\r\nAt the first step, both were flung violently to the ground, but they\r\nmanaged to scramble up, and clinging to each other with their backs bent\r\nlike two old crippled peasants, they struck into a kind of ambling trot.\r\n\r\nThere was a kind of awful grandeur in the storm to which neither was\r\ninsensible. Jagged masses of mist and ragged rain-clouds swept along\r\nthe ground. The loose earth and sand were whirled into the air and flung\r\ndown again like grape-shot, and the lips of Hobson and his companion\r\nwere wet with salt spray, although the sea was two or three miles\r\ndistant at least.\r\n\r\nDuring the rare brief pauses in the gale, they stopped and took breath,\r\nwhilst the Lieutenant ascertained their position as accurately as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe tempest increased as the night advanced, the air and water seemed\r\nto be absolutely confounded together, and low down on the horizon was\r\nformed one of those fearful waterspouts which can overthrow houses, tear\r\nup forests, and which the vessels whose safety they threaten attack with\r\nartillery. It really seemed as if the ocean itself was being torn from\r\nits bed and flung over the devoted little island.\r\n\r\nHobson could not help wondering how it was that the ice-field which\r\nsupported it was not broken in a hundred places in this violent\r\nconvulsion of the sea, the roaring of which could be distinctly heard\r\nwhere he stood. Presently Long, who was a few steps in advance, stopped\r\nsuddenly, and turning round managed to make the Lieutenant hear the\r\nbroken words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, the sea! We cannot possibly have got to the southeast coast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, look, Lieutenant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was true, a vast sheet of water was indistinctly visible before them,\r\nand large waves were rolling up and breaking at the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nHobson again had recourse to his flint, and with the aid of some lighted\r\ntouchwood consulted the needle of his compass very carefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sea is farther to the left, we have not yet\r\npassed the wood between us and Cape Michael.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fracture of the island!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson, as both were\r\ncompelled to fling themselves to the ground before the wind, \xe2\x80\x9ceither\r\na large portion of our land has been broken off and drifted away, or a\r\ngulf has been made, which we can go round. Forwards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey struggled to their feet and turned to the right towards the\r\ncentre of the island. For about ten minutes they pressed on in silence,\r\nfearing, not without reason, that all communication with the south of\r\nthe island would be found to be cut off. Presently, however, they no\r\nlonger heard the noise of the breakers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only a gulf.\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Hobson in the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s ear. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nus turn round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they resumed their original direction towards the south, but both\r\nknew only too well that they had a fearful danger to face, for that\r\nportion of the island on which they were was evidently cracked for a\r\nlong distance, and might at any moment separate entirely; should it do\r\nso under the influence of the waves, they would inevitably be drifted\r\naway, whither they knew not. Yet they did not hesitate, but plunged into\r\nthe mist, not even pausing to wonder if they should ever get back.\r\n\r\nWhat anxious forebodings must, however, have pressed upon the heart of\r\nthe Lieutenant. Could he now hope that the island would hold together\r\nuntil the winter? had not the inevitable breaking up already commenced?\r\nIf the wind should not drive them on to the coast, were they not doomed\r\nto perish very soon, to be swallowed up by the deep, leaving no trace\r\nbehind them? What a fearful prospect for all the unconscious inhabitants\r\nof the fort!\r\n\r\nBut through it all the two men, upheld by the consciousness of a duty to\r\nperform, bravely struggled on against the gale, which nearly tore them\r\nto pieces, along the new beach, the foam sometimes bathing their feet,\r\nand presently gained the large wood which shut in Cape Michael. This\r\nthey would have to cross to get to the coast by the shortest route,\r\nand they entered it in complete darkness, the wind thundering among the\r\nbranches over their heads. Everything seemed to be breaking to pieces\r\naround them, the dislocated branches intercepted their passage, and\r\nevery moment they ran a risk of being crushed beneath a falling tree, or\r\nthey stumbled over a stump they had not been able to see in the gloom.\r\nThe noise of the waves on the other side of the wood was a sufficient\r\nguide to their steps, and sometimes the furious breakers shook the\r\nweakened ground beneath their feet. Holding each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands lest\r\nthey should lose each other, supporting each other, and the one helping\r\nthe other up when he fell over some obstacle, they at last reached the\r\npoint for which they were bound.\r\n\r\nBut the instant they quitted the shelter of the wood a perfect whirlwind\r\ntore them asunder, and flung them upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant, Sergeant! Where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson with all the\r\nstrength of his lungs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, here!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Long in reply.\r\n\r\nAnd creeping on the ground they struggled to reach each other; but it\r\nseemed as if a powerful hand rivetted them to the spot on which they had\r\nfallen, and it was only after many futile efforts that they managed\r\nto reach each other. Having done so, they tied their belts together to\r\nprevent another separation, and crept along the sand to a little rising\r\nground crowned by a small clump of pines. Once there they were a little\r\nmore protected, and they proceeded to dig themselves a hole, in which\r\nthey crouched in a state of absolute exhaustion and prostration.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes neither spoke. With eyes half closed they lay in a kind\r\nof torpor, whilst the trees above them bent beneath the wind, and their\r\nbranches rattled like the bones of a skeleton. But yet again they roused\r\nthemselves from this fatal lethargy, and a few mouthfuls of rum from the\r\nSergeant\xe2\x80\x99s flask revived them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hope these trees will hold,\xe2\x80\x9d at last observed Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that our hole will not blow away with them,\xe2\x80\x9d added the\r\nSergeant, crouching in the soft sand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9chere we are at last, a few feet from Cape\r\nMichael, and as we came to make observations, let us make them. I have\r\na presentiment, Sergeant, only a presentiment, remember, that we are not\r\nfar from firm ground!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad the southern horizon been visible the two adventurers would have\r\nbeen able to see two-thirds of it from their position; but it was too\r\ndark to make out anything, and if the hurricane had indeed driven them\r\nwithin sight of land, they would not be able to see it until daylight,\r\nunless a fire should be lighted on the continent.\r\n\r\nAs the Lieutenant had told Mrs Barnett, fishermen often visited that\r\npart of North America, which is called New Georgia, and there are a good\r\nmany small native colonies, the members of which collect the teeth of\r\nmammoths, these fossil elephants being very numerous in these\r\nlatitudes. A few degrees farther south, on the island of Sitka, rises\r\nNew-Archangel, the principal settlement in Russian America, and the\r\nhead-quarters of the Russian Fur Company, whose jurisdiction once\r\nextended over the whole of the Aleutian Islands. The shores of the\r\nArctic Ocean are, however, the favourite resort of hunters, especially\r\nsince the Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company took a lease of the districts formerly\r\nin the hands of the Russians; and Hobson, although he knew nothing\r\nof the country, was well acquainted with the habits of those who were\r\nlikely to visit it at this time of the year, and was justified in\r\nthinking that he might meet fellow-countrymen, perhaps even members of\r\nhis own Company, or, failing them, some native Indians, scouring the\r\ncoasts.\r\n\r\nBut could the Lieutenant reasonably hope that Victoria Island had been\r\ndriven towards the coast?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a hundred times yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to the Sergeant again\r\nand again. \xe2\x80\x9cFor seven days a hurricane has been blowing from the\r\nnortheast, and although I know that the island is very flat, and there\r\nis not much for the wind to take hold of, still all these little hills\r\nand woods spread out like sails must have felt the influence of the wind\r\nto a certain extent. Moreover, the sea which bears us along feels its\r\npower, and large waves are certainly running in shore. It is impossible\r\nfor us to have remained in the current which was dragging us to the\r\nwest, we must have been driven out of it, and towards the south. Last\r\ntime we took our bearings we were two hundred miles from the coast, and\r\nin seven days \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour reasonings are very just, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Sergeant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I feel that whether the wind helps us or not, God will not\r\nforsake us. It cannot be His will that so many unfortunate creatures\r\nshould perish, and I put my trust in Him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two talked on in broken sentences, making each other hear above the\r\nroaring of the storm, and struggling to pierce the gloom which closed\r\nthem in on every side; but they could see nothing, not a ray of light\r\nbroke the thick darkness.\r\n\r\nAbout half past one A.M. the hurricane ceased for a few minutes, whilst\r\nthe fury of the sea seemed to be redoubled, and the large waves, lashed\r\ninto foam, broke over each other with a roar like thunder.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Hobson seizing his companion\xe2\x80\x99s arm shouted\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe noise of the sea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long, listening more attentively,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the sound of the breakers seems to me not\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly the same... isn\xe2\x80\x99t it Sergeant; listen, listen, it\r\nis like the sound of surf!... it seems as if the waves were breaking\r\nagainst rocks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson and the Sergeant now listened intently, the monotonous sound\r\nof the waves dashing against each other in the offing was certainly\r\nexchanged for the regular rolling sound produced by the breaking of\r\nwater against a hard body; they heard the reverberating echoes which\r\ntold of the neighbourhood of rocks, and they knew that along the whole\r\nof the coast of their island there was not a single stone, and nothing\r\nmore sonorous than the earth and sand of which it was composed!\r\n\r\nCould they have been deceived? The Sergeant tried to rise to listen\r\nbetter, but he was immediately flung down by the hurricane, which\r\nrecommenced with renewed violence. The lull was over, and again the\r\nnoise of the waves was drowned in the shrill whistling of the wind, and\r\nthe peculiar echo could no longer be made out.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of the two explorers will readily be imagined. They again\r\ncrouched down in their hole, doubting whether it would not perhaps be\r\nprudent to leave even this shelter, for they felt the sand giving\r\nway beneath them, and the pines cracking at their very roots. They\r\npersevered, however, in gazing towards the south, every nerve strained\r\nto the utmost, in the effort to distinguish objects through the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe first grey twilight of the dawn might soon be expected to appear,\r\nand a little before half-past two A.M. Long suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there\xe2\x80\x94over there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed to the south-west. Was he mistaken? No, for Hobson also\r\nmade out a faint glimmer in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, Sergeant, a fire; there is land there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless it is a fire on board ship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ship at sea in this weather!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible!\r\nNo, no, there is land there, land I tell you, a few miles from us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us make a signal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sergeant, we will reply to the fire on the mainland by a fire on\r\nour island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course neither Hobson nor Long had a torch, but above their heads\r\nrose resinous pines distorted by the hurricane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour flint, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson.\r\n\r\nLong at once struck his flint, lighted the touchwood, and creeping along\r\nthe sand climbed to the foot of the thicket of firs, where he was soon\r\njoined by the Lieutenant. There was plenty of deadwood about, and they\r\npiled it up at the stems of the trees, set fire to it, and soon, the\r\nwind helping them, they had the satisfaction of seeing the whole thicket\r\nin a blaze\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cas we saw their fire, they will see ours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe firs burnt with a lurid glare like a large torch. The dried resin in\r\nthe old trunks aided the conflagration, and they were rapidly consumed.\r\nAt last the crackling ceased, the flames died away, and all was\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nHobson and Long looked in vain for an answering fire\xe2\x80\x94nothing was to be\r\nseen. For ten minutes they watched, hoping against hope, and were just\r\nbeginning to despair, when suddenly a cry was heard, a distinct cry for\r\nhelp. It was a human voice, and it came from the sea.\r\n\r\nHobson and Long, wild with eager anxiety, let themselves slide down to\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nThe cry was not, however, repeated.\r\n\r\nThe daylight was now gradually beginning to appear, and the violence of\r\nthe tempest seemed to be decreasing. Soon it was light enough for the\r\nhorizon to be examined.\r\n\r\nBut there was no land in sight, sea and sky were still blended in one\r\nunbroken circle.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. MRS. PAULINA BARNETT\xe2\x80\x99S EXCURSION. The whole morning\r\nHobson and Sergeant Long wandered about the coast. The weather was much\r\nimproved, the rain had ceased, and the wind had veered round to\r\nthe south-east with extraordinary suddenness, without unfortunately\r\ndecreasing in violence, causing fresh anxiety to the Lieutenant, who\r\ncould no longer hope to reach the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe south-east wind would drive the wandering island farther from the\r\ncontinent, and fling it into the dangerous currents, which must drift it\r\nto the north of the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nHow could they even be sure that they had really approached the coast\r\nduring the awful night just over. Might it not have been merely a fancy\r\nof the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s? The air was now clear, and they could look round\r\na radius of several miles; yet there was nothing in the least resembling\r\nland within sight. Might they not adopt the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion,\r\nthat a ship had passed the island during the night, that the fire and\r\ncry were alike signals of sailors in distress? And if it had been a\r\nvessel, must it not have foundered in such a storm?\r\n\r\nWhatever the explanation there was no sign of a wreck to be seen either\r\nin the offing or on the beach, and the waves, now driven along by the\r\nwind from the land, were large enough to have overwhelmed any vessel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Long, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must remain upon our island,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, pressing\r\nhis hand to his brow; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must remain on our island and wait for\r\nwinter; it alone can save us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now mid-day, and Hobson, anxious to get back to Fort Hope before\r\nthe evening, at once turned towards Cape Bathurst.\r\n\r\nThe wind, being now on their backs, helped them along as it had done\r\nbefore. They could not help feeling very uneasy, as they were naturally\r\nafraid that the island might have separated into two parts in the storm.\r\nThe gulf observed the night before might have spread farther, and if so\r\nthey would be cut off from their friends.\r\n\r\nThey soon reached the wood they had crossed the night before. Numbers of\r\ntrees were lying on the ground, some with broken stems, others torn up\r\nby the roots from the soft soil, which had not afforded them sufficient\r\nsupport. The few which remained erect were stripped of their leaves,\r\nand their naked branches creaked and moaned as the south-east wind swept\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nTwo miles beyond this desolated forest the wanderers arrived at the edge\r\nof the gulf they had seen the night before without being able to judge\r\nof its extent. They examined it carefully, and found that it was about\r\nfifty feet wide, cutting the coast line straight across near Cape\r\nMichael and what was formerly Fort Barnett, forming a kind of estuary\r\nrunning more than a mile and a half inland. If the sea should again\r\nbecome rough in a fresh storm, this gulf would widen more and more.\r\n\r\nJust as Hobson approached the beach, he saw a large piece of ice\r\nseparate from the island and float away!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Long, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the danger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth then turned hurriedly to the west, and walked as fast as they could\r\nround the huge gulf, making direct for Fort Hope.\r\n\r\nThey noticed no other changes by the way, and towards four o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nthey crossed the court and found all their comrades at their usual\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nHobson told his men that he had wished once more before the winter to\r\nsee if there were any signs of the approach of Captain Craventy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconvoy, and that his expedition had been fruitless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Marbre, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we must give up all idea\r\nof seeing our comrades from Fort Reliance for this year at least?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you must,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson simply, re-entering the public\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and Madge were told of the two chief events of the\r\nexploration: the fire and the cry. Hobson was quite sure that neither he\r\nnor the Sergeant were mistaken. The fire had really been seen, the cry\r\nhad really been heard; and after a long consultation every one came to\r\nthe conclusion that a ship in distress had passed within sight during\r\nthe night, and that the island had not approached the American coast.\r\n\r\nThe south-east wind quickly chased away the clouds and mists, so that\r\nHobson hoped to be able to take his bearings the next day. The night\r\nwas colder and a fine snow fell, which quickly covered the ground. This\r\nfirst sign of winter was hailed with delight by all who knew of the\r\nperil of their situation.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd September the sky gradually became free from vapours of all\r\nkinds, and the sun again appeared. Patiently the Lieutenant awaited\r\nits culmination; at noon he took the latitude, and two hours later a\r\ncalculation of hour-angles gave him the longitude.\r\n\r\nThe following were the results obtained: Latitude, 70\xc2\xb0 57\xe2\x80\x99;\r\nlongitude, 170\xc2\xb0 30\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nSo that, in spite of the violence of the hurricane, the island had\r\nremained in much the same latitude, although it had been drifted\r\nsomewhat farther west. They were now abreast of Behring Strait, but four\r\nhundred miles at least north of Capes East and Prince of Wales, which\r\njut out on either side at the narrowest part of the passage.\r\n\r\nThe situation was, therefore, more dangerous than ever, as the island\r\nwas daily getting nearer to the dangerous Kamtchatka Current, which, if\r\nit once seized it in its rapid waters, might carry it far away to the\r\nnorth. Its fate would now soon be decided. It would either stop where\r\nthe two currents met, and there be shut in by the ice of the approaching\r\nwinter, or it would be drifted away and lost in the solitudes of the\r\nremote hyperborean regions.\r\n\r\nHobson was painfully moved on ascertaining the true state of things, and\r\nbeing anxious to conceal his emotion, he shut himself up in his own room\r\nand did not appear again that day. With his chart before him, he racked\r\nhis brains to find some way out of the difficulties with which be was\r\nbeset.\r\n\r\nThe temperature fell some degrees farther the same day, and the mists,\r\nwhich had collected above the south-eastern horizon the day before,\r\nresolved themselves into snow during the night, so that the next day the\r\nwhite carpet was two inches thick. Winter was coming at last.\r\n\r\nOn September 3rd Mrs Barnett resolved to go a few miles along the coast\r\ntowards Cape Esquimaux. She wished to see for herself the changes lately\r\nproduced. If she had mentioned her project to the Lieutenant, he would\r\ncertainly have offered to accompany her; but she did not wish to disturb\r\nhim, and decided to go without him, taking Madge with her. There was\r\nreally nothing to fear, the only formidable animals, the bears, seemed\r\nto have quite deserted the island after the earthquake; and two women\r\nmight, without danger, venture on a walk of a few hours without an\r\nescort.\r\n\r\nMadge agreed at once to Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, and without a word\r\nto any one they set out at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock A.M., provided with an\r\nice-chisel, a flask of spirits, and a wallet of provisions.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Cape Bathurst they turned to the west. The sun was already\r\ndragging its slow course along the horizon, for at this time of year it\r\nwould only be a few degrees above it at its culmination. But its oblique\r\nrays were clear and powerful, and the snow was already melting here and\r\nthere beneath their influence.\r\n\r\nThe coast was alive with flocks of birds of many kinds; ptarmigans,\r\nguillemots, puffins, wild geese, and ducks of every variety fluttered\r\nabout, uttering their various cries, skimming the surface of the sea\r\nor of the lagoon, according as their tastes led them to prefer salt or\r\nfresh water.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett had now a capital opportunity of seeing how many furred\r\nanimals haunted the neighbourhood of Fort Hope. Martens, ermines,\r\nmusk-rats, and foxes were numerous, and the magazines of the factory\r\nmight easily have been filled with their skins, but what good would that\r\nbe now? The inoffensive creatures, knowing that hunting was suspended,\r\nwent and came fearlessly, venturing close up to the palisade, and\r\nbecoming tamer every day. Their instinct doubtless told them that they\r\nand their old enemies were alike prisoners on the island, and a common\r\ndanger bound them together. It struck Mrs Barnett as strange that\r\nthe two enthusiastic hunters\xe2\x80\x94Marbre and Sabine\xe2\x80\x94should obey the\r\nLieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s orders to spare the furred animals without remonstrance\r\nor complaint, and appeared not even to wish to shoot the valuable game\r\naround them. It was true the foxes and others had not yet assumed\r\ntheir winter robes, but this was not enough to explain the strange\r\nindifference of the two hunters.\r\n\r\nWhilst walking at a good pace and talking over their strange situation,\r\nMrs Barnett and Madge carefully noted the peculiarities of the sandy\r\ncoast. The ravages recently made by the sea were distinctly visible.\r\nFresh landslips enabled them to see new fractures in the ice distinctly.\r\nThe strand, fretted away in many places, had sunk to an enormous extent,\r\nand the waves washed along a level beach when the perpendicular shores\r\nhad once checked their advance. It was evident that parts of the island\r\nwere now only on a level with the ocean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Madge!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett, pointing to the long smooth tracts\r\non which the curling waves broke in rapid succession, \xe2\x80\x9cour situation\r\nhas indeed become aggravated by the awful storm! It is evident that the\r\nlevel of the whole island is gradually becoming lower. It is now only\r\na question of time. Will the winter come soon enough to save us?\r\nEverything depends upon that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe winter will come, my dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge with her usual\r\nunshaken confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have already had two falls of snow. Ice is\r\n[begininng] beginning to accumulate, and God will send it us in time, I\r\nfeel sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right. Madge, we must have faith!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nwomen who do not trouble ourselves about the scientific reasons for\r\nphysical phenomena can hope, when men who are better informed,\r\nperhaps, despair. That is one of our blessings, which our Lieutenant\r\nunfortunately does not share. He sees the significance of facts, he\r\nreflects, he calculates, he reckons up the time still remaining to us,\r\nand I see that he is beginning to lose all hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a brave, energetic man, for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cand if it be in the power of man to\r\nsave us, he will do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the two women had walked four miles. They were often\r\nobliged to go inland for some little distance, to avoid parts of\r\nthe coast already invaded by the sea. Here and there the waves had\r\nencroached half-a-mile beyond the former high-water line, and the\r\nthickness of the ice-field had been considerably reduced. There was\r\ndanger that it would soon yield in many places, and that new bays would\r\nbe formed all along the coast.\r\n\r\nAs they got farther from the fort Mrs Barnett noticed that the number of\r\nfurred animals decreased considerably. The poor creatures evidently felt\r\nmore secure near a human habitation. The only formidable animals which\r\nhad not been led by instinct to escape in time from the dangerous island\r\nwere a few wolves, savage beasts which even a common danger did not\r\nconciliate. Mrs Barnett and Madge saw several wandering about on the\r\nplains, but they did not approach, and soon disappeared behind the hills\r\non the south of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will become of all these imprisoned animals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen all food fails them, and they are famished with hunger in the\r\nwinter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not be famished in a hurry, Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand we shall have nothing to fear from them; all the martens,\r\nermines, and Polar hares, which we spare will fall an easy prey to them.\r\nThat is not our danger; the brittle ground beneath our feet, which may\r\nat any moment give way, is our real peril. Only look how the sea is\r\nadvancing here. It already covers half the plain, and the waves, still\r\ncomparatively warm, are eating away our island above and below at the\r\nsame time! If the cold does not stop it very soon, the sea will shortly\r\njoin the lake, and we shall lose our lagoon as we lost our river and our\r\nport!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that should happen it will indeed be an irreparable\r\nmisfortune!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Barnett, looking inquiringly at her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we shall have no more fresh water,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we shall not want for fresh water, Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe rain, the snow, the ice, the icebergs of the ocean, the very\r\nice-field on which we float, will supply us with that; no, no, that is\r\nnot our danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Mrs Barnett and Madge had readied the rising ground\r\nabove Cape Esquimaux, but at least two miles inland, for they had found\r\nit impossible to follow the coast, worn away as it was by the sea. Being\r\nrather tired with the many d\xc3\xa9tours they had had to make, they decided\r\nto rest a few minutes before setting off on their return to Fort Hope. A\r\nlittle hill crowned by a clump of birch trees and a few shrubs afforded\r\na pleasant shelter, and a bank covered with yellow moss, from which the\r\nsnow had melted, served them as a seat. The little wallet was opened,\r\nand they shared their simple repast like sisters.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, Mrs Barnett proposed that they should climb\r\nalong the promontory to the sea, and find out the exact state of Cape\r\nEsquimaux. She was anxious to know if the point of it had resisted the\r\nstorm, and Madge declared herself ready to follow \xe2\x80\x9cher dear girl\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwherever she went, but at the same time reminded her that they were\r\neight or nine miles from Cape Bathurst already, and that they must not\r\nmake Lieutenant Hobson uneasy by too long an absence.\r\n\r\nBut some presentiment made Mrs Barnett insist upon doing as she\r\nproposed, and she was right, as the event proved. It would only delay\r\nthem half an hour after all.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone a quarter of a mile before Mrs Barnett stopped\r\nsuddenly, and pointed to some clear and regular impressions upon the\r\nsnow. These marks must have been made within the last nine or ten hours,\r\nor the last fall of snow would have covered them over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat animal has passed along here, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not an animal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, bending down to examine\r\nthe marks more closely, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a quadruped certainly, for its four feet\r\nwould have left impressions very different from these. Look, Madge, they\r\nare the footprints of a human person!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who could have been here?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Madge; \xe2\x80\x9cnone of the\r\nsoldiers or women have left the fort, and we are on an island, remember.\r\nYou must be mistaken, my dear; but we will follow the marks, and see\r\nwhere they lead us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did so, and fifty paces farther on both again paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Madge, look!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett, seizing her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm, \xe2\x80\x9cand then say if I am mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNear the footprints there were marks of a heavy body having been dragged\r\nalong the snow, and the impression of a hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the hand of a woman or a child!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9ca woman or a child has fallen here\r\nexhausted, and risen again to stumble farther on; look, the footprints\r\nagain, and father on more falls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, who could it have been?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett. \xe2\x80\x9cSome unfortunate creature\r\nimprisoned like ourselves for three or four months perhaps. Or some\r\nshipwrecked wretch flung upon the coast in the storm. You remember the\r\nfire and the cry of which Sergeant Long and Lieutenant Hobson spoke.\r\nCome, come, Madge, there may be some one in danger for us to save!\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs Barnett, dragging Madge with her, ran along following the\r\ntraces, and further on found that they were stained with blood.\r\n\r\nThe brave, tender-hearted woman, had spoken of saving some one in\r\ndanger; had she then forgotten that there was no safety for any upon the\r\nisland, doomed sooner or later to be swallowed up by the ocean?\r\n\r\nThe impressions on the ground led towards Cape Esquimaux. And the two\r\ncarefully traced them, but the footprints presently disappeared, whilst\r\nthe blood-stains increased, making an irregular pathway along the snow.\r\nIt was evident the poor wretch had been unable to walk farther, and had\r\ncrept along on hands and knees; here and there fragments of torn clothes\r\nwere scattered about, bits of sealskin and fur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett, whose heart beat violently.\r\n\r\nMadge followed her, they were only a few yards from Cape Esquimaux,\r\nwhich now rose only a few feet upon the sea-level against the background\r\nof the sky, and was quite deserted.\r\n\r\nThe impressions now led them to the right of the cape, and running along\r\nthey soon climbed to the top, but there was still nothing, absolutely\r\nnothing, to be seen. At the foot of the cape, where the slight ascent\r\nbegan, the traces turned to the right, and led straight to the sea.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett was turning to the right also, but just as she was stepping\r\non to the beach, Madge, who had been following her and looking about\r\nuneasily, caught hold of her hand, and exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! stop!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Madge, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett, who was drawn\r\nalong by a kind of instinct in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop, and look!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madge, tightening her hold on her\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nOn the beach, about fifty paces from Cape Esquimaux, a large white mass\r\nwas moving about and growling angrily.\r\n\r\nIt was an immense Polar bear, and the two women watched it with beating\r\nhearts. It was pacing round and round a bundle of fur on the ground,\r\nwhich it smelt at every now and then, lifting it up and letting it fall\r\nagain. The bundle of fur looked like the dead body of a walrus.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and Madge did not know what to think, whether to advance\r\nor to retreat, but presently as the body was moved about a kind of hood\r\nfell back from the head, and some long locks of brown hair were thrown\r\nover the snow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a woman! a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett, eager to rush to her\r\nassistance and find out if she were dead or alive!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Madge, holding her back; \xe2\x80\x9cthe bear won\xe2\x80\x99t harm\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the formidable creature merely turned the body over, and\r\nshowed no inclination of tearing it with its dreadful claws. It went\r\naway and came back apparently uncertain what to do. It had not yet\r\nperceived the two women who were so anxiously watching it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a loud crack was heard. The earth shook, and it seemed as if\r\nthe whole of Cape Esquimaux were about to be plunged into the sea.\r\n\r\nA large piece of the island had broken away, and a huge piece of ice,\r\nthe centre of gravity of which had been displaced by the alteration in\r\nits specific weight, drifted away, carrying with it the bear and the\r\nbody of the woman.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett screamed, and would have flung herself upon the broken\r\nice before it floated away, if Madge had not clutched her hand firmly,\r\nsaying quietly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! stop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the noise produced by the breaking off of the piece of ice, the bear\r\nstarted back with a fearful growl, and, leaving the body, rushed to the\r\nside where the fracture had taken place; but he was already some forty\r\nfeet from the coast, and in his terror he ran round and round the islet,\r\ntearing up the ground with his claws, and stamping the sand and snow\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nPresently he returned to the motionless body, and, to the horror of the\r\ntwo women, seized it by the clothes with his teeth, and carrying it to\r\nthe edge of the ice, plunged with it into the sea.\r\n\r\nBeing a powerful swimmer, like the whole race of Arctic bears, he soon\r\ngained the shores of the island. With a great exertion of strength\r\nhe managed to climb up the ice, and having reached the surface of the\r\nisland he quietly laid down the body he had brought with him.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett could no longer be held back, and, shaking off Madge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhold, she rushed to the beach, never thinking of the danger she ran in\r\nfacing a formidable carnivorous creature.\r\n\r\nThe bear, seeing her approach, reared upon his hind legs, and came\r\ntowards her, but at about ten paces off he paused, shook his great head,\r\nand turning round with a low growl, quietly walked away towards the\r\ncentre of the island, without once looking behind him. He, too, was\r\nevidently affected by the mysterious fear which had tamed all the wild\r\nanimals on the island.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett was soon bending over the body stretched about the snow.\r\n\r\nA cry of astonishment burst from her lips:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadge, Madge, come!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMadge approached and looked long and fixedly at the inanimate body. It\r\nwas the young Esquimaux girl Kalumah!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. KALUMAH\xe2\x80\x99S ADVENTURES. Kalumah on the floating island, two\r\nhundred miles from the American coast. It was almost incredible!\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be ascertained was whether the poor creature still\r\nbreathed. Was it possible to restore her to life? Mrs Barnett loosened\r\nher clothes, and found that her body was not yet quite cold. Her heart\r\nbeat very feebly, but it did beat. The blood they had seen came from a\r\nslight wound in her hand; Madge bound it up with her handkerchief, and\r\nthe bleeding soon ceased.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Mrs Barnett raised the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s head, and managed\r\nto pour a few drops of rum between her parted lips. She then bathed her\r\nforehead and temples with cold water, and waited.\r\n\r\nA few minutes passed by, and neither of the watchers were able to utter\r\na word, so anxious were they lest the faint spark of life remaining to\r\nthe young Esquimaux should be quenched.\r\n\r\nBut at last Kalumah\xe2\x80\x99s breast heaved with a faint sigh, her hands moved\r\nfeebly, and presently she opened her eyes, and recognising her preserver\r\nshe murmured\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Barnett! Mrs Barnett!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady was not a little surprised at hearing her own name. Had Kalumah\r\nvoluntarily sought the floating island, and did she expect to find her\r\nold European friends on it? If so, how had she come to know it, and\r\nhow had she managed to reach the island, two hundred miles from the\r\nmainland? How could she have guessed that the ice-field as bearing Mrs\r\nBarnett and all the occupants of Fort Hope away from the American coast?\r\nReally it all seemed quite inexplicable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lives\xe2\x80\x94she will recover!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madge, who felt the vital\r\nheat and pulsation returning to the poor bruised body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child, poor child\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9c said Mrs Barnett, much affected; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\nmurmured my name when she was at the point of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut now Kalumah again half opened her eyes, and looked about her with a\r\ndreamy unsatisfied expression, presently, however, seeing Mrs Barnett,\r\nher face brightened, the same name again burst from her lips, and\r\npainfully raising her hand she let it fall on that of her friend.\r\n\r\nThe anxious care of the two women soon revived Kalumah, whose extreme\r\nexhaustion arose not only from fatigue but also from hunger. She had\r\neaten nothing for forty-eight hours. Some pieces of cold venison and\r\na little rum refreshed her, and she soon felt able to accompany her\r\nnewly-found friends to the fort.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, however, Kalumah, seated on the sand between Mrs\r\nBarnett and Madge, overwhelmed them with thanks and expressions of\r\nattachment. Then she told her story: she had not forgotten the Europeans\r\nof Fort Hope, and the thought of Mrs Paulina Barnett had been ever\r\npresent with her. It was not by chance, as we shall see, that she had\r\ncome to Victoria Island.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief summary of what Kalumah related to Mrs\r\nBarnett:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOur readers will remember the young Esquimaux\xe2\x80\x99s promise to come and\r\nsee her friends at Fort Hope again in the fine season of the next year.\r\nThe long Polar night being over, and the month of May having come round,\r\nKalumah set out to fulfil her pledge. She left Russian America, where\r\nshe had wintered, and accompanied by one of her brothers-in-law, started\r\nfor the peninsula of Victoria.\r\n\r\nSix weeks later, towards the middle of June, she got to that part of\r\nBritish America which is near Cape Bathurst. She at once recognised the\r\nvolcanic mountains shutting in Liverpool Bay, and twenty miles farther\r\neast she came to Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay, where her people had so often hunted\r\nmorses and seals.\r\n\r\nBut beyond the bay on the north, there was nothing to be seen. The\r\ncoast suddenly sank to the south-east in an almost straight line. Cape\r\nEsquimaux and Cape Bathurst had alike disappeared.\r\n\r\nKalumah understood what had happened. Either the whole of the peninsula\r\nhad been swallowed up by the waves, or it was floating away as an\r\nisland, no one knew whither!\r\n\r\nKalumah\xe2\x80\x99s tears flowed fast at the loss of those whom she had come so\r\nfar to see.\r\n\r\nHer brother-in-law, however, had not appeared surprised at the\r\ncatastrophe. A kind of legend or tradition had been handed down amongst\r\nthe nomad tribes of North America, that Cape Bathurst did not form part\r\nof the mainland, but had been joined on to it thousands of years before,\r\nand would sooner or later be torn away in some convulsion of nature.\r\nHence the surprise at finding the factory founded by Hobson at the foot\r\nof the cape. But with the unfortunate reserve characteristic of their\r\nrace, and perhaps also under the influence of that enmity which all\r\nnatives feel for those who settle in their country, they said nothing to\r\nthe Lieutenant, whose fort was already finished. Kalumah knew nothing of\r\nthis tradition, which after all rested on no trustworthy evidence, and\r\nprobably belonged to the many northern legends relating to the creation.\r\nThis was how it was that the colonists of Fort Hope were not warned of\r\nthe danger they ran in settling on such a spot.\r\n\r\nHad a word in season been spoken to Hobson he would certainly have gone\r\nfarther in search of some firmer foundation for his fort than this soil,\r\ncertain peculiarities of which he had noticed at the first.\r\n\r\nWhen Kalumah had made quite sure that all trace of Cape Bathurst was\r\ngone, she explored the coast as far as the further side of Washburn Bay,\r\nbut without finding any sign of those she sought, and at last there was\r\nnothing left for her to do but to return to the fisheries of Russian\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nShe and her brother-in-law left Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay at the end of June, and\r\nfollowing the coast got back to New Georgia towards the end of July,\r\nafter an absolutely fruitless journey.\r\n\r\nKalumah now gave up all hope of again seeing Mrs Barnett and the other\r\ncolonists of Fort Hope. She concluded that they had all been swallowed\r\nup by the ocean long ago.\r\n\r\nAt this part of her tale the young Esquimaux looked at Mrs Barnett with\r\neyes full of tears, and pressed her hand [affectionaly] affectionately,\r\nand then she murmured her thanks to God for her own preservation through\r\nthe means of her friend.\r\n\r\nKalumah on her return home resumed her customary occupations, and worked\r\nwith the rest of her tribe at the fisheries near Icy Cape, a point a\r\nlittle above the seventieth parallel, and more than six hundred miles\r\nfrom Cape Bathurst.\r\n\r\nNothing worthy of note happened during the first half of the month of\r\nApril; but towards the end the storm began which had caused Hobson so\r\nmuch uneasiness, and which had apparently extended its ravages over\r\nthe whole of the Arctic Ocean and beyond Behring Strait. It was equally\r\nviolent at Icy Cape and on Victoria Island, and, as the Lieutenant\r\nascertained in taking his bearings, the latter was then not more than\r\ntwo hundred miles from the coast.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs Barnett listened to Kalumah, her previous information enabled her\r\nrapidly to find the key to the strange events which had taken place, and\r\nto account for the arrival of the young native on the island.\r\n\r\nDuring the first days of the storm the Esquimaux of Icy Cape were\r\nconfined to their huts. They could neither get out nor fish. But during\r\nthe night of the 31st August a kind of presentiment led Kalumah to\r\nventure down to the beach, and, braving the wind and rain in all their\r\nfury, she peered anxiously through the darkness at the waves rising\r\nmountains high.\r\n\r\nPresently she thought she saw a huge mass driven along by the hurricane\r\nparallel with the coast. Gifted with extremely keen sight\xe2\x80\x94as are all\r\nthese wandering tribes accustomed to the long dark Polar nights\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nfelt sure that she was not mistaken.\r\n\r\nSomething of vast bulk was passing two miles from the coast, and that\r\nsomething could be neither a whale, a boat, nor, at this time of the\r\nyear, even an iceberg.\r\n\r\nBut Kalumah did not stop to reason. The truth flashed upon her like\r\na revelation. Before her excited imagination rose the images of her\r\nfriends. She saw them all once more, Mrs Barnett, Madge, Lieutenant\r\nHobson, the baby she had covered with kisses at Fort Hope. Yes, they\r\nwere passing, borne along in the storm on a floating ice-field!\r\n\r\nKalumah did not doubt or hesitate a moment. She felt that she must tell\r\nthe poor shipwrecked people, which she was sure they were, of the close\r\nvicinity of the land. She ran to her hut, seized a torch of tow and\r\nresin, such as the Esquimaux use when fishing at night, lit it and waved\r\nit on the beach at the summit of Icy Cape.\r\n\r\nThis was the fire which Hobson and Long had seen when crouching on Cape\r\nMichael on the night of the 31st August.\r\n\r\nImagine the delight and excitement of the young Esquimaux when a signal\r\nreplied to hers, when she saw the huge fire lit by Lieutenant Hobson,\r\nthe reflection of which reached the American coast, although he did not\r\ndream that he was so near it.\r\n\r\nBut it quickly went out, the lull in the storm only lasted a few\r\nminutes, and the fearful gale, veering round to the south-east, swept\r\nalong with redoubled violence.\r\n\r\nKalumah feared that her \xe2\x80\x9cprey,\xe2\x80\x9d so she called the floating island,\r\nwas about to escape her, and that it would not be driven on to the\r\nshore. She saw it fading away, and knew that it would soon disappear in\r\nthe darkness and be lost to her on the boundless ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a terrible moment for the young native, and she determined\r\nat all hazards to let her friends know of their situation. There might\r\nyet be time for them to take some steps for their deliverance, although\r\nevery hour took them farther from the continent.\r\n\r\nShe did not hesitate a moment, her kayak was at hand, the frail bark in\r\nwhich she had more than once braved the storms of the Arctic Ocean, she\r\npushed it down to the sea, hastily laced on the sealskin jacket fastened\r\nto the canoe, and, the long paddle in her hand, she plunged into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett here pressed the brave child to her heart, and Madge shed\r\ntears of sympathy.\r\n\r\nWhen launched upon the roaring ocean, Kalumah found the change of wind\r\nin her favour. The waves dashed over her kayak, it is true, but they\r\nwere powerless to harm the light boat, which floated on their crests\r\nlike a straw. It was capsized several times, but a stroke of the paddle\r\nrighted it at once.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour\xe2\x80\x99s hard work, Kalumah could see the wandering\r\nisland more distinctly, and had no longer any doubt of effecting her\r\npurpose, as she was but a quarter of a mile from the beach.\r\n\r\nIt was then that she uttered the cry which Hobson and Long had heard.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! Kalumah now felt herself being carried away towards the west\r\nby a powerful current, which could take firmer hold of her kayak than of\r\nthe floating island!\r\n\r\nIn vain she struggled to beat back with her paddle, the light boat\r\nshot along like an arrow. She uttered scream after scream, but she was\r\nunheard, for she was already far away, and when the day broke the coasts\r\nof Alaska and the island she had wished to reach, were but two distant\r\nmasses on the horizon.\r\n\r\nDid she despair? Not yet. It was impossible to get back to the American\r\ncontinent in the teeth of the terrible wind which was driving the island\r\nbefore it at a rapid pace, taking it out two hundred miles in thirty-six\r\nhours, and assisted by the current from the coast.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing left to do. To get to the island by keeping in\r\nthe same current which was drifting it away.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s strength was not equal to her courage, she\r\nwas faint from want of food, and, exhausted as she was, she could no\r\nlonger wield her paddle.\r\n\r\nFor some hours she struggled on, and seemed to be approaching the\r\nisland, although those on it could not see her, as she was but a speck\r\nupon the ocean. She struggled on until her stiffened arms and bleeding\r\nhands fell powerless, and, losing consciousness, she was floated along\r\nin her frail kayak at the mercy of winds and waves.\r\n\r\nShe did not know how long this lasted, she remembered nothing more,\r\nuntil a sudden shock roused her, her kayak had struck against something,\r\nit opened beneath her, and she was plunged into cold water, the\r\nfreshness of which revived her. A few moments later, she was flung upon\r\nthe sand in a dying state by a large wave.\r\n\r\nThis had taken place the night before, just before dawn\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, about two or three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. Kalumah had then been\r\nseventy hours at sea since she embarked!\r\n\r\nThe young native had no idea where she had been thrown, whether on the\r\ncontinent or on the floating island, which she had so bravely sought,\r\nbut she hoped the latter. Yes, hoped that she had reached her friends,\r\nalthough she knew that the wind and current had driven them into the\r\nopen sea, and not towards the coast!\r\n\r\nThe thought revived her, and, shattered as she was, she struggled to her\r\nfeet, and tried to follow the coast.\r\n\r\nShe had, in fact, been providentially thrown on that portion of Victoria\r\nIsland which was formerly the upper corner of Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay. But, worn\r\naway as it was by the waves, she did not recognise the land with which\r\nshe had once been familiar.\r\n\r\nShe tottered on, stopped, and again struggled to advance; the beach\r\nbefore her appeared endless, she had so often to go round where the sea\r\nhad encroached upon the sand. And so dragging herself along, stumbling\r\nand scrambling up again, she at last approached the little wood where\r\nMrs. Barnett and Madge had halted that very morning. We know that the\r\ntwo women found the footprints left by Kalumah in the snow not far from\r\nthis very spot, and it was at a short distance farther on that the poor\r\ngirl fell for the last time. Exhausted by fatigue and hunger, she still\r\nmanaged to creep along on hands and knees for a few minutes longer.\r\n\r\nA great hope kept her from despair, for she had at last recognised Cape\r\nEsquimaux, at the foot of which she and her people had encamped the year\r\nbefore. She knew now that she was but eight miles from the factory, and\r\nthat she had only to follow the path she had so often traversed when she\r\nwent to visit her friends at Fort Hope.\r\n\r\nYes, this hope sustained her, but she had scarcely reached the\r\nbeach when her forces entirely failed her, and she again lost all\r\nconsciousness. But for Mrs Barnett she would have died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that you would come to my\r\nrescue, and that God would save me by your means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe know the rest. We know the providential instinct which led Mrs\r\nBarnett and Madge to explore this part of the coast on this very day,\r\nand the presentiment which made them visit Cape Esquimaux after they had\r\nrested, and before returning to Fort Hope. We know too\xe2\x80\x94as Mrs Barnett\r\nrelated to Kalumah\xe2\x80\x94 how the piece of ice had floated away, and how the\r\nbear had acted under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after all,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Barnett with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cit was not I who\r\nsaved you, but the good creature without whose aid you would never have\r\ncome back to us, and if ever we see him again we will treat him with the\r\nrespect due to your preserver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this long conversation Kalumah was rested and refreshed, and Mrs\r\nBarnett proposed that they should return to the fort at once, as she\r\nhad already been too long away. The young girl immediately rose ready to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett was indeed most anxious to tell the Lieutenant of all that\r\nhad happened during the night of the storm, when the wandering island\r\nhad neared the American continent, but she urged Kalumah to keep her\r\nadventures secret, and to say nothing about the situation of the\r\nisland. She would naturally be supposed to have come along the coast, in\r\nfulfilment of the promise she had made to visit her friends in the fine\r\nseason. Her arrival would tend only to strengthen the belief of the\r\ncolonists that no changes had taken place in the country around\r\nCape Bathurst, and to set at rest the doubts any of them might have\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nIt was about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Madge and Mrs Barnett, with Kalumah\r\nhanging on her arm, set out towards the east, and before five o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nin the afternoon they all arrived at the postern of the fort.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE KAMTCHATKA CURRENT. We can readily imagine the reception\r\ngiven to Kalumah by all at the fort. It seemed to them that the\r\ncommunication with the outer world was reopened. Mrs Mac-Nab, Mrs Rae\r\nand Mrs Joliffe overwhelmed her with caresses, but Kalumah\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nthought was for the little child, she caught sight of him immediately,\r\nand running to him covered him with kisses.\r\n\r\nThe young native was charmed and touched with the hospitality of her\r\nEuropean hosts. A positive f\xc3\xaate was held in her honour and every one\r\nwas delighted that she would have to remain at the fort for the winter,\r\nthe season being too far advanced for her to get back to the settlements\r\nof Russian America before the cold set in.\r\n\r\nBut if all the settlers were agreeably surprised at the appearance\r\nof Kalumah, what must Lieutenant Hobson have thought when he saw her\r\nleaning on Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s arm. A sudden hope flashed across his mind\r\nlike lightning, and as quickly died away: perhaps in spite of the\r\nevidence of his daily observations Victoria Island had run aground\r\nsomewhere on the continent unnoticed by any of them.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett read the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts in his face, and shook her\r\nhead sadly.\r\n\r\nHe saw that no change had taken place in their situation, and waited\r\nuntil Mrs Barnett was able to explain Kalumah\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he was walking along the beach with the lady,\r\nlistening with great interest to her account of Kalumah\xe2\x80\x99s adventures.\r\n\r\nSo he had been right in all his conjectures. The north-east hurricane\r\nhad driven the island out of the current. The ice-field had approached\r\nwithin a mile at least of the American continent. It had not been a fire\r\non board ship which they had seen, or the cry of a shipwrecked mariner\r\nwhich they had heard. The mainland had been close at hand, and had the\r\nnorth-east wind blown hard for another hour Victoria Island would have\r\nstruck against the coast of Russian America. And then at this critical\r\nmoment a fatal, a terrible wind had driven the island away from the\r\nmainland back to the open sea, and it was again in the grasp of the\r\nirresistible current, and was being carried along with a speed which\r\nnothing could check, the mighty south-east wind aiding its headlong\r\ncourse, to that terribly dangerous spot where it would be exposed to\r\ncontrary attractions, either of which might lead to its destruction and\r\nthat of all the unfortunate people dragged along with it.\r\n\r\nFor the hundredth time the Lieutenant and Mrs Barnett discussed all the\r\nbearings of the case, and then Hobson inquired if any important changes\r\nhad taken place in the appearance of the districts between Cape Bathurst\r\nand Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay?\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett replied that in some places the level of the coast appeared\r\nto be lowered, and that the waves now covered tracts of sand which\r\nwere formerly out of their reach. She related what had happened at Cape\r\nEsquimaux, and the important fracture which had taken place at that part\r\nof the coast.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been less satisfactory. It was evident that the\r\nice-field forming the foundation of the island was breaking up. What\r\nhad happened at Cape Esquimaux might at any moment be reproduced at\r\nCape Bathurst. At any hour of the day or night the houses of the factory\r\nmight be swallowed up by the deep, and the only thing which could save\r\nthem was the winter, the bitter winter which was fortunately rapidly\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nThe next day, September 4th, when Hobson took his bearings, he found\r\nthat the position of Victoria Island had not sensibly changed since\r\nthe day before. It had remained motionless between the two contrary\r\ncurrents, which was on the whole the very best thing that could have\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only the cold would fix us where we are, if the ice wall would\r\nshut us in, and the sea become petrified around us,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hobson,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should feel that our safety was assured. We are but two hundred\r\nmiles from the coast at this moment, and by venturing across the frozen\r\nice fields we might perhaps reach either Russian America or Kamtchatka.\r\nWinter, winter at any price, let the winter set in, no matter how\r\nrapidly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, according to the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s orders, the preparations for\r\nthe winter were completed. Enough forage to last the dogs the whole of\r\nthe Polar night was stored up. They were all in good health, but getting\r\nrather fat with having nothing to do. They could not be taken too much\r\ncare of, as they would have to work terribly hard in the journey across\r\nthe ice after the abandonment of Fort Hope. It was most important to\r\nkeep up their strength, and they were fed on raw reindeer venison,\r\nplenty of which was easily attainable.\r\n\r\nThe tame reindeer also prospered, their stable was comfortable, and a\r\ngood supply of moss was laid by for them in the magazines of the fort.\r\nThe females provided Mrs Joliffe with plenty of milk for her daily\r\nculinary needs.\r\n\r\nThe Corporal and his little wife had also sown fresh seeds, encouraged\r\nby the success of the last in the warm season. The ground had been\r\nprepared beforehand for the planting of scurvy-grass and Labrador\r\nTea. It was important that there should be no lack of these valuable\r\nanti-scorbutics.\r\n\r\nThe sheds were filled with wood up to the very roof. Winter might come\r\nas soon as it liked now, and freeze the mercury in the cistern of the\r\nthermometer, there was no fear that they would again be reduced to burn\r\ntheir furniture as they had the year before. Mac-Nab and his men had\r\nbecome wise by experience, and the chips left from the boat-building\r\nadded considerably to their stock of fuel.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a few animals were taken which had already assumed their\r\nwinter furs, such as martens, polecats, blue foxes, and ermines. Marbre\r\nand Sabine had obtained leave from the Lieutenant to set some traps\r\noutside the enceinte. He did not like to refuse them this permission,\r\nlest they should become discontented, as he had really no reason to\r\nassign for putting a stop to the collecting of furs, although he knew\r\nfull well that the destination of these harmless creatures could do\r\nnobody any good. Their flesh was, however, useful for feeding the dogs,\r\nand enabled them to economise the reindeer venison.\r\n\r\nAll was now prepared for the winter, and the soldiers worked with an\r\nenergy which they would certainly not have shown if they had been told\r\nthe secret of their situation.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days the bearings were taken with the greatest care,\r\nbut no change was noticeable in the situation of Victoria Island;\r\nand Hobson, finding that it was motionless, began to have fresh hope.\r\nAlthough there were as yet no symptoms of winter in inorganic nature,\r\nthe temperature maintaining a mean height of 49\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit, some swans\r\nflying to the south in search of a warmer climate was a good omen. Other\r\nbirds capable of a long-sustained flight over vast tracts of the ocean\r\nbegan to desert the island. They knew full well that the continent of\r\nAmerica and of Asia, with their less severe climates and their plentiful\r\nresources of every kind, were not far off, and that their wings were\r\nstrong enough to carry them there. A good many of these birds were\r\ncaught; and by Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s advice the Lieutenant tied round their\r\nnecks a stiff cloth ticket, on which was inscribed the position of the\r\nwandering island, and the names of its inhabitants. The birds were then\r\nset free, and their captors watched them wing their way to the south\r\nwith envious eyes.\r\n\r\nOf course none were in the secret of the sending forth of these\r\nmessengers, except Mrs Barnett, Madge, Kalumah, Hobson, and Long.\r\n\r\nThe poor quadrupeds were unable to seek their usual winter refuges in\r\nthe south. Under ordinary circumstances the reindeer, Polar hares, and\r\neven the wolves would have left early in September for the shores of the\r\nGreat Bear and Slave Lakes, a good many degrees farther south; but now\r\nthe sea was an insurmountable barrier, and they, too, would have to wait\r\nuntil the winter should render it passable. Led by instinct they had\r\ndoubtless tried to leave the island, but, turned back by the water, the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation had brought them to the neighbourhood\r\nof Fort Hope, to be near the men who were once their hunters and\r\nmost formidable enemies, but were now, like themselves, rendered\r\ncomparatively inoffensive by their imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe observations of the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th September, revealed\r\nno alteration in the position of Victoria Island. The large eddy between\r\nthe two currents kept it stationary. Another fifteen days, another three\r\nweeks of this state of things, and Hobson felt that they might be saved.\r\n\r\nBut they were not yet out of danger, and many terrible, almost\r\nsupernatural, trials still awaited the inhabitants of Fort Hope.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of September observations showed a displacement of Victoria\r\nIsland. Only a slight displacement, but in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nHobson was in dismay; the island was finally in the grasp of the\r\nKamtchatka Current, and was drifting towards the unknown latitudes\r\nwhere the large icebergs come into being; it was on its way to the vast\r\nsolitudes of the Arctic Ocean, interdicted to the human race, from which\r\nthere is no return.\r\n\r\nHobson did not hide this new danger from those who were in the secret of\r\nthe situation. Mrs Barnett, Madge, Kalumah, and Sergeant Long received\r\nthis fresh blow with courage and resignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cthe island may stop even yet.\r\nPerhaps it will move slowly. Let us hope on ... and wait! The winter is\r\nnot far off, and we are going to meet it. In any case God\xe2\x80\x99s will be\r\ndone!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you not think I\r\nought now to tell our comrades. You see in what a terrible position\r\nwe are and all that may await us! Is it not taking too great a\r\nresponsibility to keep them in ignorance of the peril they are in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should wait a little longer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett without\r\nhesitation; \xe2\x80\x9cI would not give them all over to despair until the last\r\nchance is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my opinion also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long.\r\n\r\nHobson had thought the same, and was glad to find that his companions\r\nagreed with him in the matter.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th and 12th September, the motion towards the north was more\r\nnoticeable. Victoria Island was drifting at a rate of from twelve to\r\nthirteen miles a day, so that each day took them the same distance\r\nfarther from the land and nearer to the north. They were, in short,\r\nfollowing the decided course made by the Kamtchatka Current, and would\r\nquickly pass that seventieth degree which once cut across the extremity\r\nof Cape Bathurst, and beyond which no land of any kind was to be met\r\nwith in this part of the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nEvery day Hobson looked out their position on the map, and saw only too\r\nclearly to what awful solitudes the wandering island was drifting.\r\n\r\nThe only hope left consisted, as Mrs Barnett had said, in the fact that\r\nthey were going to meet the winter. In thus drifting towards the north\r\nthey would soon encounter those ice-cold waters, which would consolidate\r\nand strengthen the foundations of the island. But if the danger of\r\nbeing swallowed up by the waves was decreased, would not the unfortunate\r\ncolonists have an immense distance to traverse to get back from these\r\nremote northern regions? Had the boat been finished, Lieutenant Hobson\r\nwould not have hesitated to embark the whole party in it, but in spite\r\nof the zealous efforts of the carpenter it was not nearly ready, and\r\nindeed it taxed Mac-Nab\xe2\x80\x99s powers to the uttermost to construct a\r\nvessel on which to trust the lives of twenty persons in such a dangerous\r\nsea\r\n\r\nBy the 16th September Victoria Island was between seventy-three and\r\neighty miles north of the spot where its course had been arrested for\r\na few days between the Behring and Kamtchatka Cur rents There were now,\r\nhowever, many signs of the approach of winter Snow fell frequently\r\nand in large flakes The column of mercury fell gradually The mean\r\ntemperature was still 44\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit during the day, but at night it\r\nfell to 32\xc2\xb0. The sun described an extremely lengthened curve above\r\nthe horizon, not rising more than a few degrees even at noon, and\r\ndisappearing for eleven hours out of every twenty four.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the night of the 16th September, the first signs of ice\r\nappeared upon the sea in the shape of small isolated crystals like\r\nsnow, which stained the clear surface of the water As was noticed by the\r\nfamous explorer Scoresby, these crystals immediately calmed the waves,\r\nlike the oil which sailors pour upon the sea to produce a momentary\r\ncessation of its agitation These crystals showed a tendency to weld\r\nthemselves together, but they were broken and separated by the motion of\r\nthe water as soon as they had combined to any extent.\r\n\r\nHobson watched the appearance of the \xe2\x80\x9cyoung ice\xe2\x80\x9d with extreme\r\nattention. He knew that twenty four hours would suffice to make the\r\nice-crust two or three inches thick, strong enough in fact to bear the\r\nweight of a man He therefore expected that Victoria Island would shortly\r\nbe arrested in its course to the north.\r\n\r\nBut the day ended the work of the night, and if the speed of the island\r\nslackened during the darkness in consequence of the obstacles in its\r\npath, they were removed in the next twelve hours, and the island was\r\ncarried rapidly along again by the powerful current.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the northern regions became daily less, and nothing\r\ncould be done to lessen the evil.\r\n\r\nAt the autumnal equinox on the 21st of September, the day and night were\r\nof equal length, and from that date the night gradually became longer\r\nand longer. The winter was coming at last, but it did not set in rapidly\r\nor with any rigour Victoria Island was now nearly a degree farther north\r\nthan the seventieth parallel, and on this 21st September, a rotating\r\nmotion was for the first time noticed, a motion estimated by Hobson at\r\nabout a quarter of the circumference.\r\n\r\nImagine the anxiety of the unfortunate Lieutenant. The secret he had so\r\nlong carefully kept was now about to be betrayed by nature to the least\r\nclear sighted. Of course the rotation altered the cardinal points of the\r\nisland. Cape Bathurst no longer pointed to the north, but to the east.\r\nThe sun, moon, and stars rose and set on a different horizon, and it was\r\nimpossible that men like Mac-Nab, Rae, Marbre and others, accustomed to\r\nnote the signs of the heavens, could fail to be struck by the change,\r\nand understand its meaning.\r\n\r\nTo Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s great satisfaction, however, the brave soldiers appeared\r\nto notice nothing, the displacement with regard to the cardinal points\r\nwas not, it was true, very considerable, and it was often too foggy for\r\nthe rising and setting of the heavenly bodies to be accurately observed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the rotation appeared to be accompanied by an increase of\r\nspeed. From that date Victoria Island drifted at the rate of a mile an\r\nhour. It advanced farther and farther north, farther and farther away\r\nfrom all land. Hobson did not even yet despair, for it was not in his\r\nnature to do so, but he felt confused and astray, and longed for the\r\nwinter with all his heart.\r\n\r\nAt last the temperature began to fall still lower. Snow fell plentifully\r\non the 23d and 24th September, and increased the thickness of the\r\ncoating of ice on the sea. Gradually the vast ice-field was formed on\r\nevery side, the island in its advance continually broke it up, but each\r\nday it became firmer and better able to resist. The sea succumbed to\r\nthe petrifying hand of winter, and became frozen as far as the eye could\r\nreach, and on September 27th, when the bearings were taken, it was\r\nfound that Victoria Island had not moved since the day before. It was\r\nimprisoned in a vast ice-field, it was motionless in longitude 177\xc2\xb0\r\n22\xe2\x80\x99, and latitude 77\xc2\xb0 57\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94more than six hundred miles from any\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI A COMMUNICATION FROM LIEUTENANT HOBSON. Such was the\r\nsituation. To use Sergeant Long\xe2\x80\x99s expression, the island had \xe2\x80\x9ccast\r\nanchor,\xe2\x80\x9d and was as stationary as when the isthmus connected it with\r\nthe mainland. But six hundred miles now separated it from inhabited\r\ncountries, six hundred miles which would have to be traversed in sledges\r\nacross the solidified surface of the sea, amongst the icebergs which the\r\ncold would build up, in the bitterest months of the Arctic winter.\r\n\r\nIt would be a fearful undertaking, but hesitation was impossible. The\r\nwinter, for which Lieutenant Hobson had so ardently longed, had come at\r\nlast, and arrested the fatal march of the island to the north. It would\r\nthrow a bridge six hundred miles long from their desolate home to the\r\ncontinents on the south, and the new chances of safety must not be\r\nneglected, every effort must be made to restore the colonists, so long\r\nlost in the hyperborean regions, to their friends.\r\n\r\nAs Hobson explained to his companions, it would be madness to linger\r\ntill the spring should again thaw the ice, which would be to abandon\r\nthemselves once more to the capricious Behring currents. They must wait\r\nuntil the sea was quite firmly frozen over, which at the most would be\r\nin another three or four weeks. Meanwhile the Lieutenant proposed making\r\nfrequent excursions on the ice-field encircling the island, in order to\r\nascertain its thickness, its suitability for the passage of sledges, and\r\nthe best route to take across it so as to reach the shores of Asia or\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Hobson to Mrs Barnett and Sergeant Long, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nwould all rather make for Russian America than Asia, if a choice is open\r\nto us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKalumah will be very useful to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cfor as a\r\nnative she will be thoroughly acquainted with the whole of Alaska.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cher arrival was most fortunate for\r\nus. Thanks to her, we shall be easily able to get to the settlement of\r\nFort Michael on Norton Sound, perhaps even to New Archangel, a good deal\r\nfarther south, where we can pass the rest of the winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Fort Hope!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cit goes to my heart to\r\nthink of abandoning it on this island. It has been built at the cost of\r\nso much trouble and fatigue, everything about it has been so admirably\r\narranged by you, Lieutenant! I feel as if my heart would break when we\r\nleave it finally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not suffer more than I shall, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand perhaps not so much. It is the chief work of my life; I have\r\ndevoted all my powers to the foundation of Fort Hope, so unfortunately\r\nnamed, and I shall never cease to regret having to leave it. And what\r\nwill the Company say which confided this task to me, for after all I am`\r\nbut its humble agent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett with enthusiasm, \xe2\x80\x9cit will say\r\nthat you have done your duty, that you are not responsible for the\r\ncaprices of nature, which is ever more powerful than man. It will\r\nunderstand that you could not foresee what has happened, for it was\r\nbeyond the penetration of the most far-sighted man, and it will know\r\nthat it owes the preservation of the whole party to your prudence and\r\nmoral courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, pressing Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, \xe2\x80\x9cthank you for your warm-hearted words. But I have had some\r\nexperience of men, and I know that success is always admired and failure\r\ncondemned. But the will of Heaven be done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Long, anxious to turn the Lieutenant from his melancholy\r\nthoughts, now began to talk about the preparations for the approaching\r\ndeparture, and asked if it was not time to tell his comrades the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us wait a little longer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have saved the\r\npoor fellows much anxiety and worry already, let us keep silent until\r\nthe day is fixed for the start, and then we will reveal the whole\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis point being decided, the ordinary occupations of the factory went\r\non for a few weeks longer.\r\n\r\nHow different was the situation of the colonists a year ago, when they\r\nwere all looking forward to the future in happy unconsciousness!\r\n\r\nA year ago the first symptoms of the cold season were appearing, even\r\nas they were now. The \xe2\x80\x9cyoung ice\xe2\x80\x9d was gradually forming along the\r\ncoast. The lagoon, its waters being quieter than those of the sea, was\r\nthe first to freeze over. The temperature remained about one or two\r\ndegrees above freezing point in the day, and fell to three or four\r\ndegrees below in the night. Hobson again made his men assume their\r\nwinter garments, the linen vests and furs before described. The\r\ncondensers were again set up inside the house, the air vessel and\r\nair-pumps were cleaned, the traps were set round the palisades on\r\ndifferent parts of Cape Bathurst, and Marbre and Sabine got plenty of\r\ngame, and finally the last touches were given to the inner rooms of the\r\nprincipal house.\r\n\r\nAlthough Fort Hope was now about two degrees farther north than at the\r\nsame time the year before, there was no sensible difference in the state\r\nof the temperature. The fact is, the distance between the seventieth and\r\nseventy-second parallels is not great enough to affect the mean height\r\nof the thermometer, on the contrary, it really seemed to be less cold\r\nthan at the beginning of the winter before. Perhaps, however, that was\r\nbecause the colonists were now, to a certain extent, acclimatised.\r\n\r\nCertainly the winter did not set in so abruptly as last time. The\r\nweather was very damp, and the atmosphere was always charged with\r\nvapour, which fell now as rain now as snow. In Lieutenant Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion, at least, it was not nearly cold enough.\r\n\r\nThe sea froze all round the island, it is true, but not in a regular or\r\ncontinuous sheet of ice. Large blackish patches here and there showed\r\nthat the icicles were not thoroughly cemented together. Loud resonant\r\nnoises were constantly heard, produced by the breaking of the ice\r\nfield when the rain melted the imperfectly welded edges of the blocks\r\ncomposing it. There was no rapid accumulation of lump upon lump such as\r\nis generally seen in intense cold. Icebergs and hummocks were few and\r\nscattered, and no ice-wall as yet shut in the horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis season would have been just the thing for the explorers of\r\nthe North West Passage, or the seekers of the North Pole,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated\r\nSergeant Long again and again, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is most unfavourable for us,\r\nand very much against our ever getting back to our own land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis went on throughout October, and Hobson announced that the mean\r\ntemperature was no lower than 32\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit, and it is well known that\r\nseveral days of cold, 7\xc2\xb0 or 8\xc2\xb0 below zero, are required for the sea to\r\nfreeze hard.\r\n\r\nHad proof been needed that the ice-field was impassable, a fact noticed\r\nby Mrs Barnett and Hobson would have sufficed.\r\n\r\nThe animals imprisoned in the island, the furred animals, reindeer,\r\nwolves, &c., would have left the island had it been possible to cross\r\nthe sea, but they continued to gather in large numbers round the\r\nfactory, and to seek the vicinity of man. The wolves came actually\r\nwithin musket-range of the enceinte to devour the martens and Polar\r\nhares, which were their only food. The famished reindeer having neither\r\nmoss nor herbs on which to browse, roved about Cape Bathurst in herds.\r\nA solitary bear, no doubt the one to which Mrs Barnett and Kalumah felt\r\nthey owed a debt of gratitude, often passed to and fro amongst the trees\r\nof the woods, on the banks of the lagoon, and the presence of all these\r\nanimals, especially of the ruminants, which require an exclusively\r\nvegetable diet, proved that flight was impossible.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the thermometer remained at freezing point, and Hobson\r\nfound on consulting his journal that at the same time the year before,\r\nit had already marked 20\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit below zero, proving how unequally\r\ncold is distributed in the capricious Polar regions.\r\n\r\nThe colonists therefore did not suffer much, and were not confined to\r\nthe house at all. It was, however, very damp indeed, rain mixed with\r\nsnow fell constantly, and the falling of the barometer proved that the\r\natmosphere was charged with vapour.\r\n\r\nThroughout October the Lieutenant and Long made many excursions to\r\nascertain the state of the ice-field in the offing; one day they went to\r\nCape Michael, another to the edge of the former Walruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay, anxious\r\nto see if it would be possible to cross to the continent of America or\r\nAsia, or if the start would have to be put off.\r\n\r\nBut the surface of the ice-field was covered with puddles of water,\r\nand in some parts riddled with holes, which would certainly have been\r\nimpassable for sledges. It seemed as if it would be scarcely safe for a\r\nsingle traveller to venture across the half-liquid, half-solid masses.\r\nIt was easy to see that the cold had been neither severe nor equally\r\nmaintained, for the ice consisted of an accumulation of sharp points,\r\ncrystals, prisms, polyhedrons, and figures of every variety, like\r\nan aggregation of stalactites. It was more like a glacier than a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfield,\xe2\x80\x9d and even if it had been practicable, walking on it would\r\nhave been very tiring.\r\n\r\nHobson and Long managed with great difficulty to scramble over a mile or\r\ntwo towards the south, but at the expense of a vast amount of time, so\r\nthat they were compelled to admit that they must wait some time yet, and\r\nthey returned to Fort Hope disappointed and disheartened.\r\n\r\nThe first days of November came, and the temperature fell a little, but\r\nonly a very few degrees, which was not nearly enough. Victoria Island\r\nwas wrapped in damp fogs, and the lamps had to be lit during the day. It\r\nwas necessary, however, to economise the oil as much as possible, as the\r\nsupply was running short. No fresh stores had been brought by Captain\r\nCraventy\xe2\x80\x99s promised convoy, and there were no more walruses to be\r\nhunted. Should the dark winter be prolonged, the colonists would be\r\ncompelled to have recourse to the fat of animals, perhaps even to the\r\nresin of the firs, to get a little light. The days were already very\r\nshort, and the pale disc of the sun, yielding no warmth, and deprived of\r\nall its brightness, only appeared above the horizon for a few hours at\r\na time. Yes, winter had come with its mists, its rain, and its snow, but\r\nwithout the long desired cold.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th November something of a f\xc3\xaate was held at Fort Hope. Mrs\r\nJoliffe served up a few extras at dinner, for it was the anniversary of\r\nthe birth of little Michael Mac-Nab. He was now a year old, and was the\r\ndelight of everybody. He had large blue eyes and fair curly hair, like\r\nhis father, the head carpenter, who was very proud of the resemblance.\r\nAt dessert the baby was solemnly weighed. It was worth something to\r\nsee him struggling in the scales, and to hear his astonished cries! He\r\nactually weighed thirty-four pounds! The announcement of this wonderful\r\nweight was greeted with loud cheers, and Mrs Mac-Nab was congratulated\r\nby everybody on her fine boy. Why Corporal Joliffe felt that he ought\r\nto share the compliments it is difficult to imagine, unless it was as\r\na kind of foster-father or nurse to the baby. He had carried the child\r\nabout, dandled and rocked him so often, that he felt he had something to\r\ndo with his specific weight!\r\n\r\nThe next day, November 12th, the sun did not appear above the horizon.\r\nThe long Polar night was beginning nine days sooner than it had done\r\nthe year before, in consequence of the difference in the latitude of\r\nVictoria Island then and now.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the sun did not, however, produce any change in the\r\nstate of the atmosphere. The temperature was as changeable as ever. The\r\nthermometer fell one day and rose the next. Rain and snow succeeded each\r\nother. The wind was soft, and did not settle in any quarter, but often\r\nveered round to every point of the compass in the course of a single\r\nday. The constant damp was very unhealthy, and likely to lead to\r\nscorbutic affections amongst the colonists, but fortunately, although\r\nthe lime juice and lime lozenges were running short, and no fresh stock\r\nhad been obtained, the scurvy-grass and sorrel had yielded a very good\r\ncrop, and, by the advice of Lieutenant Hobson, a portion of them was\r\neaten daily.\r\n\r\nEvery effort must, however, be made to get away from Fort Hope. Under\r\nthe circumstances, three months would scarcely be long enough for them\r\nall to get to the nearest continent. It was impossible to risk being\r\novertaken by the thaw on the ice-field, and therefore if they started at\r\nall it must be at the end of November.\r\n\r\nThe journey would have been difficult enough, even if the ice had been\r\nrendered solid everywhere by a severe winter, and in this uncertain\r\nweather it was a most serious matter.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th November, Hobson, Mrs Barnett, and the Sergeant met to\r\ndecide on the day of departure. The Sergeant was of opinion that they\r\nought to leave the island as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must make allowance for all the possible\r\ndelays during a march of six hundred miles. We ought to reach the\r\ncontinent before March, or we may be surprised by the thaw, and then we\r\nshall be in a worse predicament than we are on our island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cis the sea firm enough for us to cross\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long, \xe2\x80\x9cand the ice gets thicker every\r\nday. The barometer, too, is gradually rising, and by the time our\r\npreparations are completed, which will be in about another week, I\r\nthink, I hope that the really cold weather will have set in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe winter has begun very badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cin fact\r\neverything seems to combine against us. Strange seasons have often\r\nbeen experienced on these seas, I have heard of whalers being able to\r\nnavigate in places where, even in the summer at another time they would\r\nnot have had an inch of water beneath their keels. In my opinion there\r\nis not a day to be lost, and I cannot sufficiently regret that the\r\nordinary temperature of these regions does not assist us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will later,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cand we must be ready to take\r\nadvantage of every chance in our favour. When do you propose starting,\r\nLieutenant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of November at the latest,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if\r\nin a week hence our preparations are finished, and the route appears\r\npracticable, we will start then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will get ready without losing an\r\ninstant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will now tell our companions of the\r\nsituation in which they are placed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam, the moment to speak and the time for action have alike\r\narrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when do you propose enlightening them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once. Sergeant Long,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to his subordinate, who\r\nat once drew himself up in a military attitude, \xe2\x80\x9ccall all your men\r\ntogether in the large room to receive a communication.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Long touched his cap, and turning on his heel left the room\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes Mrs Barnett and Hobson were left alone, but neither of\r\nthem spoke.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant quickly returned, and told Hobson that his orders were\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant and the lady at once went into the large room. All\r\nthe members of the colony, men and women, were assembled in the dimly\r\nlighted room.\r\n\r\nHobson came forward, and standing in the centre of the group said very\r\ngravely\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends, until to-day I have felt it my duty, in order to spare\r\nyou useless anxiety, to conceal from you the situation of our fort. An\r\nearthquake separated us from the continent. Cape Bathurst has broken\r\naway from the mainland. Our peninsula is but an island of ice, a\r\nwandering island\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAt this moment Marbre stepped forward, and said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe knew it, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. A CHANCE TO BE TRIED. The brave fellows knew it then! And\r\nthat they might not add to the cares of their chief, they had pretended\r\nto know nothing, and had worked away at the preparations for the winter\r\nwith the same zeal as the year before.\r\n\r\nTears of emotion stood in Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and he made no attempt to\r\nconceal them, but seizing Marbre\xe2\x80\x99s outstretched hand, he pressed it in\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nYes, the soldiers all knew it, for Marbre had guessed it long ago. The\r\nfilling of the reindeer trap with salt water, the non-arrival of\r\nthe detachment from Fort Reliance, the observations of latitude and\r\nlongitude taken every day, which would have been useless on firm ground,\r\nthe precautions observed by Hobson to prevent any one seeing him take\r\nthe bearings, the fact of the animals remaining on the island after\r\nwinter had set in, and the change in the position of the cardinal points\r\nduring the last few days, which they had noticed at once, had all been\r\ntokens easily interpreted by the inhabitants of Fort Hope. The arrival\r\nof Kalumah had puzzled them, but they had concluded that she had been\r\nthrown upon the island in the storm, and they were right, as we are\r\naware.\r\n\r\nMarbre, upon whom the truth had first dawned, confided his suspicions\r\nto Mac-Nab the carpenter and Rae the blacksmith. All three faced the\r\nsituation calmly enough, and agreed that they ought to tell their\r\ncomrades and wives, but decided to let the Lieutenant think they knew\r\nnothing, and to obey him without question as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are indeed brave fellows, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett,\r\nwho was much touched by this delicate feeling, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are true\r\nsoldiers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Lieutenant may depend upon us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mac-Nab, \xe2\x80\x9che has done\r\nhis duty, and we will do ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you will, dear comrades,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cand if only Heaven\r\nwill help and not forsake us, we will help ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant then related all that had happened since the time when\r\nthe earthquake broke the isthmus, and converted the districts round Cape\r\nBathurst into an island. He told how, when the sea became free from ice\r\nin the spring, the new island had been drifted more than two hundred\r\nmiles away from the coast by an unknown current, how the hurricane had\r\ndriven it back within sight of land, how it had again been carried away\r\nin the night of the 31st August, and, lastly, how Kalumah had bravely\r\nrisked her life to come to the aid of her European friends. Then he\r\nenumerated the changes the island had undergone, explaining how the\r\nwarmer waters had worn it away, and his fear that it might be carried\r\nto the Pacific, or seized by the Kamtchatka Current, concluding his\r\nnarrative by stating that the wandering island had finally stopped on\r\nthe 27th of last September.\r\n\r\nThe chart of the Arctic seas was then brought, and Hobson pointed out\r\nthe position occupied by the island\xe2\x80\x94six hundred miles from all land.\r\n\r\nHe ended by saying that the situation was extremely dangerous, that\r\nthe island would inevitably be crushed when the ice broke up, and that,\r\nbefore having recourse to the boat\xe2\x80\x94which could not be used until the\r\nnext summer\xe2\x80\x94they must try to get back to the American continent by\r\ncrossing the ice-field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have six hundred miles to go in the cold and darkness of the\r\nPolar night. It will be hard work, my friends, but you know as well as I\r\ndo that there can be no shrinking from the task.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you give the signal to start, Lieutenant, we will follow you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mac-Nab.\r\n\r\nAll being of one mind, the preparations for departure were from that\r\ndate rapidly pushed forward. The men bravely faced the fact that they\r\nwould have six hundred miles to travel under very trying circumstances.\r\nSergeant Long superintended the works, whilst Hobson, the two hunters,\r\nand Mrs Barnett, often went to test the firmness of the ice-field.\r\nKalumah frequently accompanied them, and her remarks, founded on\r\nexperience, might possibly be of great use to the Lieutenant. Unless\r\nthey were prevented they were to start on the 20th November, and there\r\nwas not a moment to lose.\r\n\r\nAs Hobson had foreseen, the wind having risen, the temperature fell\r\nslightly, and the column of mercury marked 24\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nSnow, which soon became hardened, replaced the rain of the preceding\r\ndays. A few more days of such cold and sledges could be used. The little\r\nbay hollowed out of the cliffs of Cape Michael was partly filled with\r\nice and snow; but it must not be forgotten that its calmer waters\r\nfroze more quickly than those of the open sea, which were not yet in a\r\nsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nThe wind continued to blow almost incessantly, and with considerable\r\nviolence, but the motion of waves interfered with the regular formation\r\nand consolidation of the ice. Large pools of water occurred here and\r\nthere between the pieces of ice, and it was impossible to attempt to\r\ncross it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe weather is certainly getting colder,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Barnett\r\nto Lieutenant Hobson, as they were exploring the south of the island\r\ntogether on the 10th November, \xe2\x80\x9cthe temperature is becoming lower and\r\nlower, and these liquid spaces will soon freeze over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are right, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the way in\r\nwhich they will freeze over will not be very favourable to our plans.\r\nThe pieces of ice are small, and their jagged edges will stick up all\r\nover the surface, making it very rough, so that if our sledges get over\r\nit at all, it will only be with very great difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cif I am not mistaken, a heavy fall of\r\nsnow, lasting a few days or even a few hours, would suffice to level the\r\nentire surface!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if snow should fall, it will be\r\nbecause the temperature has risen; and if it rises, the ice-field will\r\nbreak up again, so that either contingency will be against us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt really would be a strange freak of fortune if we should experience\r\na temperate instead of an Arctic winter in the midst of the Polar\r\nSea!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has happened before, madam, it has happened before. Let me remind\r\nyou of the great severity of last cold season; now it has been noticed\r\nthat two long bitter winters seldom succeed each other, and the whalers\r\nof the northern seas know it well. A bitter winter when we should have\r\nbeen glad of a mild one, and a mild one when we so sorely need the\r\nreverse. It must be owned, we have been strangely unfortunate thus\r\nfar! And when I think of six hundred miles to cross with women and a\r\nchild!\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nAnd Hobson pointed to the vast white plain, with strange irregular\r\nmarkings like guipure work, stretching away into the infinite\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you will, dear comrades,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cand if only Heaven\r\nwill help and not forsake us, we will help ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant then related all that had happened since the time when\r\nthe earthquake broke the isthmus, and converted the districts round Cape\r\nBathurst into an island.

And when I think of six hundred miles to cross with women and a\r\nchild!\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nAnd Hobson pointed to the vast white plain, with strange irregular\r\nmarkings like guipure work, stretching away into the infinite distance.\r\nSad and desolate enough it looked, the imperfectly frozen surface\r\ncracking every now and then with an ominous sound. A pale moon, its\r\nlight half quenched in the damp mists, rose but a few degrees above the\r\ngloomy horizon and shot a few faint beams upon the melancholy scene.\r\nThe half-darkness and the refraction combined doubled the size of every\r\nobject. Icebergs of moderate height assumed gigantic proportions, and\r\nwere in some cases distorted into the forms of fabulous monsters. Birds\r\npassed overhead with loud flapping of wings, and in consequence of this\r\noptical illusion the smallest of them appeared as large as a condor or\r\na vulture. In the midst of the icebergs yawned apparently huge black\r\ntunnels, into which the boldest man would scarcely dare to venture, and\r\nnow and then sudden convulsions took place, as the icebergs, worn away\r\nat the base, heeled over with a crash, the sonorous echoes taking up\r\nthe sounds and carrying them along. The rapid changes resembled the\r\ntransformation scenes of fairyland, and terrible indeed must all those\r\nphenomena have appeared to the luckless colonists who were about to\r\nventure across the ice-field!\r\n\r\nIn spite of her moral and physical courage Mrs Barnett could not control\r\nan involuntary shudder. Soul and body alike shrunk from the awful\r\nprospect, and she was tempted to shut her eyes and stop her ears that\r\nshe might see and hear no more. When the moon was for a moment veiled\r\nbehind a heavy cloud, the gloom of the Polar landscape became still more\r\nawe-inspiring, and before her mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye rose a vision of the caravan\r\nof men and women struggling across these vast solitudes in the midst of\r\nhurricanes, snow-storms, avalanches, and in the thick darkness of the\r\nArctic night!\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett, however, forced herself to look; she wished to accustom\r\nher eyes to these scenes, and to teach herself not to shrink from facing\r\ntheir terrors. But as she gazed a cry suddenly burst from her lips, and\r\nseizing Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s hand, she pointed to a huge object, of ill-defined\r\ndimensions, moving about in the uncertain light, scarcely a hundred\r\npaces from where they stood.\r\n\r\nIt was a white monster of immense size, more than a hundred feet high.\r\nIt was pacing slowly along over the broken ice, bounding from one piece\r\nto another, and beating the air with its huge feet, between which it\r\ncould have held ten large dogs at least. It, too, seemed to be seeking\r\na practicable path across the ice\xe2\x80\x94it, too, seemed anxious to fly from\r\nthe doomed island. The ice gave way beneath its weight, and it had often\r\nconsiderable difficulty in regaining its feet.\r\n\r\nThe monster made its way thus for about a quarter of a mile across the\r\nice, and then, its farther progress being barred, it turned round and\r\nadvanced towards the spot where Mrs Barnett and the Lieutenant stood.\r\n\r\nHobson seized the gun which was slung over his shoulder and presented\r\nit at the animal, but almost immediately lowering the weapon, he said to\r\nMrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bear, madam, only a bear, the size of which has been greatly\r\nmagnified by refraction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, a Polar bear, and Mrs Barnett drew a long breath of\r\nrelief as she understood the optical illusion of which she had been the\r\nvictim. Then an idea struck her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my bear!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe bear with the devotion of a\r\nNewfoundland dog! Probably the only one still on the island. But what is\r\nhe doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is trying to get away,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis trying to escape from this doomed island, and he cannot do so! He is\r\nproving to us that we cannot pass where he has had to turn back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson was right, the imprisoned animal had tried to leave the island\r\nand to get to the continent, and having failed it was returning to the\r\ncoast. Shaking its head and growling, it passed some twenty paces from\r\nthe two watchers, and, either not seeing them or disdaining to take\r\nany notice of them, it walked heavily on towards Cape Michael, and soon\r\ndisappeared behind the rising ground.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson and Mrs Barnett returned sadly and silently to the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for departure went on as rapidly, however, as if it\r\nwere possible to leave the island. Nothing was neglected to promote the\r\nsuccess of the undertaking, every possible danger had to be foreseen,\r\nand not only had the ordinary difficulties and dangers of a journey\r\nacross the ice to be allowed for, but also the sudden changes of weather\r\npeculiar to the Polar regions, which so obstinately resist every attempt\r\nto explore them.\r\n\r\nThe teams of dogs required special attention. They were allowed to run\r\nabout near the fort, that they might regain the activity of which too\r\nlong a rest had, to some extent, deprived them, and they were soon in a\r\ncondition to make a long march.\r\n\r\nThe sledges were carefully examined and repaired. The rough surface\r\nof the ice-field would give them many violent shocks, and they were\r\ntherefore thoroughly overhauled by Mac-Nab and his men, the inner\r\nframework and the curved fronts being carefully repaired and\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nTwo large waggon sledges were built, one for the transport of\r\nprovisions, the other for the peltries. These were to be drawn by\r\nthe tamed reindeer, which had been well trained for the service. The\r\npeltries or furs were articles of luxury with which it was not perhaps\r\nquite prudent to burden the travellers, but Hobson was anxious to\r\nconsider the interests of the Company as much as possible, although he\r\nwas resolved to abandon them, en route, if they harassed or impeded his\r\nmarch. No fresh risk was run of injury of the furs, for of course they\r\nwould have been lost if left at the factory.\r\n\r\nIt was of course quite another matter with the provisions, of which a\r\ngood and plentiful supply was absolutely necessary. It was of no use to\r\ncount on the product of the chase this time. As soon as the passage of\r\nthe ice-field became practicable, all the edible game would get on\r\nahead and reach the mainland before the caravan. One waggon sledge was\r\ntherefore packed with salt meat, corned beef, hare pat\xc3\xa8s, dried fish,\r\nbiscuits\xe2\x80\x94the stock of which was unfortunately getting low\xe2\x80\x94and an\r\nample reserve of sorrel, scurvy-grass, rum, spirits of wine, for making\r\nwarm drinks, &c. &c. Hobson would have been glad to take some fuel\r\nwith him, as he would not meet with a tree, a shrub, or a bit of moss\r\nthroughout the march of six hundred miles, nor could he hope for pieces\r\nof wreck or timber cast up by the sea, but he did not dare to overload\r\nhis sledges with wood. Fortunately there was no lack of warm comfortable\r\ngarments, and in case of need they could draw upon the reserve of\r\npeltries in the waggon.\r\n\r\nThomas Black, who since his misfortune had altogether retired from\r\nthe world, shunning his companions, taking part in none of the\r\nconsultations, and remaining shut up in his own room, reappeared as soon\r\nas the day of departure was definitely fixed. But even then he\r\nattended to nothing but the sledge which was to carry his person,\r\nhis instruments, and his registers. Always very silent, it was now\r\nimpossible to get a word out of him. He had forgotten everything, even\r\nthat he was a scientific man, and since he had been deceived about the\r\neclipse, since the solution of the problem of the red prominences of\r\nthe moon had escaped him, he had taken no notice of any of the peculiar\r\nphenomena of the high latitudes, such as the Aurora Borealis, halos,\r\nparhelia, &c.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few days every one worked so hard that all was ready for\r\nthe start on the morning of the 18th November.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the ice-field was still impassable. Although the thermometer\r\nhad fallen slightly, the cold had not been severe enough to freeze the\r\nsurface of the sea, with any uniformity, and the snow which fell was\r\nfine and intermittent. Hobson, Marbre, and Sabine went along the coast\r\nevery day from Cape Michael to what was once the corner of the old\r\nWalruses\xe2\x80\x99 Bay. They even ventured out about a mile and a half upon\r\nthe ice-field, but were compelled to admit that it was broken by\r\nrents, crevasses, and fissures in every direction. Not only would it be\r\nimpossible for sledges to cross it, it was dangerous for unencumbered\r\npedestrians. Hobson and his two men underwent the greatest fatigue in\r\nthese short excursions, and more than once they ran a risk of being\r\nunable to get back to Victoria Island across the ever-changing,\r\never-moving blocks of ice.\r\n\r\nReally all nature seemed to be in league against the luckless colonists.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th and 19th November, the thermometer rose, whilst the\r\nbarometer fell. Fatal results were to be feared from this change in\r\nthe state of the atmosphere. Whilst the cold decreased the sky became\r\ncovered with clouds, which presently resolved themselves into heavy rain\r\ninstead of the sadly-needed snow, the column of mercury standing at 34\xc2\xb0\r\nFahrenheit. These showers of comparatively warm water melted the snow\r\nand ice in many places, and the result can easily be imagined. It\r\nreally seemed as if a thaw were setting in, and there were symptoms of a\r\ngeneral breaking up of the ice-field. In spite of the dreadful weather,\r\nhowever, Hobson went to the south of the island every day, and every day\r\nreturned more disheartened than before.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, a tempest resembling in violence that of the month before,\r\nbroke upon the gloomy Arctic solitudes, compelling the colonists to give\r\nup going out, and to remain shut up in Fort Hope for two days.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. ACROSS THE ICE-FIELD. At last, on the 22d of November, the\r\nweather moderated. In a few hours the storm suddenly ceased. The wind\r\nveered round to the north, and the thermometer fell several degrees. A\r\nfew birds capable of a long-sustained flight took wing and disappeared.\r\nThere really seemed to be a likelihood that the temperature was at last\r\ngoing to become what it ought to be at this time of the year in such an\r\nelevated latitude. The colonists might well regret that it was not now\r\nwhat it had been during the last cold season, when the column of mercury\r\nfell to 72\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit below zero.\r\n\r\nHobson determined no longer to delay leaving Victoria Island, and on the\r\nmorning of the 22d the whole of the little colony was ready to leave the\r\nisland, which was now firmly welded to the ice-field, and by its means\r\nconnected with the American continent, six hundred miles away.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven A.M., Hobson gave the signal of departure. The sky\r\nwas grey but clear, and lighted up from the horizon to the zenith by a\r\nmagnificent Aurora Borealis. The dogs were harnessed to the sledges,\r\nand three couple of reindeer to the waggon sledges. Silently they\r\nwended their way towards Cape Michael, where they would quit the island,\r\nproperly so called, for the ice-field.\r\n\r\nThe caravan at first skirted along the wooded hill on the east of Lake\r\nBarnett, but as they were rounding the coiner all paused to look round\r\nfor the last time at Cape Bathurst, which they were leaving never to\r\nreturn. A few snow-encrusted rafters stood out in the light of the\r\nAurora Borealis, a few white lines marked the boundaries of the enceinte\r\nof the factory, a\xe2\x80\x94white mass here and there, a few blue wreaths of\r\nsmoke from the expiring fire never to be rekindled; this was all that\r\ncould be seen of Fort Hope, now useless and deserted, but erected at the\r\ncost of so much labour and so much anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, farewell, to our poor Arctic home!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs.\r\nBarnett, waving her hand for the last time; and all sadly and silently\r\nresumed their journey.\r\n\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock the detachment arrived at Cape Michael, after having\r\nrounded the gulf which the cold had imperfectly frozen over. Thus far\r\nthe difficulties of the journey had not been very great, for the ground\r\nof the island was smooth compared to the ice-field, which was strewn\r\nwith icebergs, hummocks, and packs, between which, practicable passes\r\nhad to be found at the cost of an immense amount of fatigue.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening of the same day the party had advanced several miles\r\non the ice-field, and a halt for the night was ordered; the encampment\r\nwas to be formed by hollowing out snow-houses in the Esquimaux style.\r\nThe work was quickly accomplished with the ice-chisels, and at eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, after a salt meat supper, every one had crept into the holes,\r\nwhich are much warmer than anybody would imagine.\r\n\r\nBefore retiring, however, Mrs. Barnett asked the Lieutenant how far he\r\nthought they had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more than ten miles, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen from six hundred!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this rate, it\r\nwill take us three months to get to the American continent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps more, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we shall not be able\r\nto get on faster than this. We are not travelling as we were last year\r\nover the frozen plains between Fort Reliance and Cape Bathurst; but on a\r\ndistorted ice-field crushed by the pressure of the icebergs across which\r\nthere is no easy route. I expect to meet with almost insurmountable\r\ndifficulties on the way; may we be able to conquer them! It is not of\r\nso much importance, however, to march quickly as to preserve our health,\r\nand I shall indeed think myself fortunate if all my comrades answer to\r\ntheir names in the roll-call on our arrival at Fort Reliance. Heaven\r\ngrant we may have all landed at some point, no matter where, of the\r\nAmerican continent in three months\xe2\x80\x99 time; if so, we shall never be\r\nable to return thanks enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe night passed without incident; but during the long vigil which he\r\nkept, Hobson fancied he noticed certain ill-omened tremblings on the\r\nspot he had chosen for his encampment, and could not but fear that the\r\nvast ice-field was insufficiently cemented, and that there would be\r\nnumerous rents in the surface which would greatly impede his progress,\r\nand render communication with firm ground very uncertain. Moreover,\r\nbefore he started, he had observed that none of the animals had left\r\nthe vicinity of the fort, and they would certainly have sought a warmer\r\nclimate had not their instinct warned them of obstacles in their way.\r\nYet the Lieutenant felt that he had only done his duty in making this\r\nattempt to restore his little colony to an inhabited land, before the\r\nsetting in of the thaw, and whether he succeeded or had to turn back he\r\nwould have no reason to reproach himself.\r\n\r\nThe next day, November 23d, the detachment could not even advance ten\r\nmiles towards the east, so great were the difficulties met with. The\r\nice-field was fearfully distorted, and here and there many layers of ice\r\nwere piled one upon another, doubtless driven along by the irresistible\r\nforce of the ice-wall into the vast funnel of the Arctic Ocean. Hence\r\na confusion of masses of ice, which looked as if they had been suddenly\r\ndropped by a hand incapable of holding them, and strewn about in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that a caravan of sledges, drawn by dogs and reindeer,\r\ncould not possibly get over these blocks; and it was equally clear that\r\na path could not be cut through them with the hatchet or ice-chisel.\r\nSome of the icebergs assumed extraordinary forms, and there were groups\r\nwhich looked like towns falling into ruins. Some towered three or four\r\nhundred feet above the level of the ice-field, and were capped with\r\ntottering masses of debris, which the slightest shake or shock or gust\r\nof wind would bring down in avalanches.\r\n\r\nThe greatest precautions were, therefore, necessary in rounding these\r\nice-mountains, and orders were given not to speak above a whisper, and\r\nnot to excite the dogs by cracking the whips in these dangerous passes.\r\n\r\nBut an immense amount of time was lost in looking for practicable\r\npassages, and the travellers were worn out with fatigue, often going\r\nten miles round before they could advance one in the required direction\r\ntowards the east. The only comfort was that the ground still remained\r\nfirm beneath their feet.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th November, however, fresh obstacles arose, which Hobson\r\nreally feared, with considerable reason, would be insurmountable.\r\n\r\nAfter getting over one wall of ice which rose some twenty miles from\r\nVictoria Island, the party found themselves on a much less undulating\r\nice-field, the different portions of which had evidently not been\r\nsubjected to any great pressure. It was clear that in consequence of the\r\ndirection of the currents the influence of the masses of permanent ice\r\nin the north had not here been felt, and Hobson and his comrades soon\r\nfound that this ice-field was intersected with wide and deep crevasses\r\nnot yet frozen over. The temperature here was comparatively warm, and\r\nthe thermometer maintained a mean height of more than 34\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit.\r\nSalt water, as is well known, does not freeze so readily as fresh, but\r\nrequires several degrees of cold below freezing point before it becomes\r\nsolidified, and the sea was therefore still liquid. All the icebergs\r\nand floes here had come from latitudes farther north, and, if we may so\r\nexpress it, lived upon the cold they had brought with them. The whole\r\nof the southern portion of the Arctic Ocean was most imperfectly frozen,\r\nand a warm rain was falling, which hastened the dissolution of what ice\r\nthere was.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th November the advance of the travellers was absolutely\r\narrested by a crevasse full of rough water strewn with small icicles\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncrevasse not more than a hundred feet wide, it is true, but probably\r\nmany miles long.\r\n\r\nFor two whole hours the party skirted along the western edge of this\r\ngap, in the hope of coming to the end of it and getting to the other\r\nside, so as to resume their march to the east, but it was all in vain,\r\nthey were obliged to give it up and encamp on the wrong side.\r\n\r\nHobson and Long, however, proceeded for another quarter of a mile along\r\nthe interminable crevasse, mentally cursing the mildness of the winter\r\nwhich had brought them into such a strait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must pass somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we can\xe2\x80\x99t stay where we\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cand we shall pass it, either\r\nby going up to the north, or down to the south, it must end somewhere.\r\nBut after we have got round this we shall come to others, and so it will\r\ngo on perhaps for hundred of miles, as long as this uncertain and most\r\nunfortunate weather continues!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant, we must ascertain the truth once for all before we\r\nresume our journey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must indeed, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cor we shall\r\nrun a risk of not having crossed half the distance between us and\r\nAmerica after travelling five or six hundred miles out of our way.\r\nYes, before going farther, I must make quite sure of the state of the\r\nice-field, and that is what I am about to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without another word Hobson stripped himself, plunged into the\r\nhalf-frozen water, and being a powerful swimmer a few strokes soon\r\nbrought him to the other side of the crevasse, when he disappeared\r\namongst the icebergs.\r\n\r\nA few hours later the Lieutenant reached the encampment, to which Long\r\nhad already returned, in an exhausted condition. He took Mrs Barnett and\r\nthe Sergeant aside, and told them that the ice-field was impracticable,\r\nadding\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps one man on foot without a sledge or any encumbrances might\r\nget across, but for a caravan it is impossible. The crevasses increase\r\ntowards the east, and a boat would really be of more use than a sledge\r\nif we wish to reach the American coast\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Long, \xe2\x80\x9cif one man could cross, ought not one of us to\r\nattempt it, and go and seek assistance for the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of trying it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Lieutenant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett and Long in one breath.\r\n\r\nThese two exclamations showed Hobson how unexpected and inopportune his\r\nproposal appeared. How could he, the chief of the expedition, think of\r\ndeserting those confided to him, even although it was in their\r\ninterests and at great risk to himself. It was quite impossible, and the\r\nLieutenant did not insist upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand how it appears to you, my friends,\r\nand I will not abandon you. It would, indeed, be quite useless for any\r\none to attempt the passage; he would not succeed, he would fall by the\r\nway, and find a watery grave when the thaw sets in. And even suppose he\r\nreached New Archangel, how could he come to our rescue? Would he charter\r\na vessel to seek for us? Suppose he did, it could not start until after\r\nthe thaw. And who can tell where the currents will then have taken\r\nVictoria Island, either yet farther north or to the Behring Sea!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lieutenant, you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long; \xe2\x80\x9clet us remain\r\ntogether, and if we are to be saved in a boat, there is Mac-Nab\xe2\x80\x99s on\r\nVictoria Island, and for it at least we shall not have to wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett had listened without saying a word, but she understood that\r\nthe ice-field being impassible. they had now nothing to depend on but\r\nthe carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s boat, and that they would have to wait bravely for the\r\nthaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn to Victoria Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us return then, and God be with us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the travellers had now gathered round the Lieutenant, and he\r\nlaid his plans before them.\r\n\r\nAt first all were disposed to rebel, the poor creatures had been\r\ncounting on getting back to their homes, and felt absolutely crushed at\r\nthe disappointment, but they soon recovered their dejection and declared\r\nthemselves ready to obey.\r\n\r\nHobson then told them the results of the examination he had just made.\r\nThey learnt that the obstacles in their way on the east were so numerous\r\nthat it would be absolutely impossible to pass with the sledges and\r\ntheir contents, and as the journey would last several months, the\r\nprovisions, &c., could not be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are now,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9ccut off from all\r\ncommunication with the mainland, and by going farther towards the east\r\nwe run a risk, after enduring great fatigues, of finding it impossible\r\nto get back to the island, now our only refuge. If the thaw should\r\novertake us on the ice-field, we are lost. I have not disguised nor have\r\nI exaggerated the truth, and I know, my friends, that I am speaking to\r\nmen who have found that I am not a man to turn back from difficulties.\r\nBut I repeat, the task we have set ourselves is impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men trusted their chief implicitly. They knew his courage and\r\nenergy, and felt as they listened to his words that it was indeed\r\nimpossible to cross the ice. It was decided to start on the return\r\njourney to Fort Hope the next day, and it was accomplished under most\r\ndistressing circumstances. The weather was dreadful, squalls swept down\r\nupon the ice-field, and rain fell in torrents. The difficulty of finding\r\nthe way in the darkness through the labyrinth of icebergs can well be\r\nimagined!\r\n\r\nIt took no less than four days and four nights to get back to the\r\nisland. Several teams of dogs with their sledges fell into the\r\ncrevasses, but thanks to Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s skill, prudence, and devotion, he\r\nlost not one of his party. But what terrible dangers and fatigues they\r\nhad to go through, and how awful was the prospect of another winter on\r\nthe wandering island to the unfortunate colonists!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. THE WINTER MONTHS. The party did not arrive at Fort Hope\r\nuntil the 28th, after a most arduous journey. They had now nothing to\r\ndepend on but the boat, and that they could not use until the sea was\r\nopen, which would not be for six months.\r\n\r\nPreparations for another winter were therefore made. The sledges were\r\nunloaded, the provisions put back in the pantry, and the clothes, arms,\r\nfurs, &c., in the magazines. The dogs returned to their dog-house, and\r\nthe reindeer to their stable.\r\n\r\nGreat was the despair of Thomas Black at this return to seclusion. The\r\npoor astronomer carried his instruments, his books, and his MSS. back to\r\nhis room, and more angry than ever with \xe2\x80\x9cthe evil fate which pursued\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d he held himself aloof from everything which went on in the\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nAll were again settled at their usual winter avocations the day after\r\ntheir arrival, and the monotonous winter life once more commenced.\r\nNeedlework, mending the clothes, taking care of the furs, some of which\r\nmight yet be saved, the observation of the weather, the examination\r\nof the ice-field, and reading aloud, were the daily occupations. Mrs\r\nBarnett was, as before, the leader in everything, and her influence was\r\neverywhere felt. If, as sometimes happened, now that all were uneasy\r\nabout the future, a slight disagreement occurred between any of the\r\nsoldiers, a few words from Mrs Barnett soon set matters straight, for\r\nshe had acquired wonderful power over the little world in which she\r\nmoved, and she always used it for the good of the community.\r\n\r\nKalumah had become a great favourite with everybody, for she was always\r\npleasant and obliging. Mrs Barnett had undertaken her education, and\r\nshe got on quickly, for she was both intelligent and eager to learn. She\r\nimproved her English speaking, and also taught her to read and write\r\nin that language. There were, however, twelve masters for Kalumah, all\r\neager to assist in this branch of her education, as the soldiers had\r\nall been taught reading, writing, and arithmetic either in England or in\r\nEnglish colonies.\r\n\r\nThe building of the boat proceeded rapidly, and it was to be planked and\r\ndecked before the end of the month. Mac-Nab and some of his men worked\r\nhard in the darkness outside, with no light but the flames of burning\r\nresin, whilst others were busy making the rigging in the magazines of\r\nthe factory. Although the season was now far advanced, the weather still\r\nremained very undecided. The cold was sometimes intense, but owing to\r\nthe prevalence of west winds it never lasted long.\r\n\r\nThus passed the whole of December, rain and intermittent falls of snow\r\nsucceeded each other, the temperature meanwhile varying from 26\xc2\xb0 to\r\n34\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit. The consumption of fuel was moderate, although there\r\nwas no need to economise it, the reserves being considerable. It was\r\notherwise with the oil, upon which they depended for light, for the\r\nstock was getting so low that the Lieutenant could at last only allow\r\nthe lamps to be lit for a few hours every day. He tried using reindeer\r\nfat for lighting the house, but the smell of it was so unbearable that\r\nevery one preferred being in the dark. All work had of course to be\r\ngiven up for the time, and very tedious did the long dark hours appear.\r\n\r\nSome Auror\xc3\xa6 Borealis and two or three lunar halos appeared at full\r\nmoon, and Thomas Black might now have minutely observed all these\r\nphenomenon, and have made precise calculations on their intensity, their\r\ncoloration, connection with the electric state of the atmosphere, and\r\ntheir influence upon the magnetic needle, &c. But the astronomer did not\r\neven leave his room. His spirit was completely crushed.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th December the light of the moon revealed a long circular line\r\nof icebergs shutting in the horizon on the north and east of Victoria\r\nIsland. This was the ice-wall, the frozen masses of which were piled up\r\nto a height of some three or four hundred feet. Two-thirds of the island\r\nwere hemmed in by this mighty barrier, and it seemed probable that the\r\nblockade would become yet more complete.\r\n\r\nThe sky was clear for the first week of January. The new year, 1861,\r\nopened with very cold weather, and the column of mercury fell to 8\xc2\xb0\r\nFahrenheit. It was the lowest temperature that had yet been experienced\r\nin this singular winter, although it was anything but low for such a\r\nhigh latitude.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant felt it his duty once more to take the latitude and\r\nlongitude of the island by means of stellar observations, and found that\r\nits position had not changed at all.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, in spite of all their economy, the oil seemed likely to\r\nfail altogether. The sun would not appear above the horizon before early\r\nin February, so that there was a month to wait, during which there was a\r\ndanger of the colonists having to remain in complete darkness. Thanks\r\nto the young Esquimaux, however, a fresh supply of oil for the lamps was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd January Kalumah walked to Cape Bathurst to examine the state\r\nof the ice. All along the south of the island the ice-field was very\r\ncompact, the icicles of which it was composed were more firmly welded\r\ntogether, there were no liquid spaces between them, and the surface of\r\nthe floe, though rough, was perfectly firm everywhere. This was no doubt\r\ncaused by the pressure of the chain of icebergs on the horizon, which\r\ndrove the ice towards the north, and squeezed it against the island.\r\n\r\nAlthough she saw no crevasses or rents, the young native noticed\r\nmany circular holes neatly cut in the ice, the use of which she knew\r\nperfectly well. They were the holes kept open by seals imprisoned\r\nbeneath the solid crust of ice, and by which they came to the surface to\r\nbreathe and look for mosses under the snow on the coast.\r\n\r\nKalumah knew that in the winter bears will crouch patiently near these\r\nholes, and watching for the moment when the seal comes out of the water,\r\nthey rush upon it, hug it to death in their paws, and carry it off. She\r\nknew, too, that the Esquimaux, not less patient than the bears, also\r\nwatch for the appearance of these animals, and throwing a running noose\r\nover their heads when they push them up, drag them to the surface.\r\n\r\nWhat bears and Esquimaux could do might certainly also be done by\r\nskilful hunters, and Kalumah hastened back to the fort to tell the\r\nLieutenant of what she had seen, feeling sure that where these holes\r\nwere seals were not far off.\r\n\r\nHobson sent for the hunters, and the young native described to them\r\nthe way in which the Esquimaux capture these animals in the winter, and\r\nbegged them to try.\r\n\r\nShe had not finished speaking before Sabine had a strong rope with a\r\nrunning noose ready in his hand and accompanied by Hobson, Mrs Barnett,\r\nKalumah, and two or three soldiers, the hunters hurried to Cape\r\nBathurst, and whilst the women remained on the beach, the men made their\r\nway to the holes pointed out by Kalumah. Each one was provided with a\r\nrope, and stationed himself at a different hole.\r\n\r\nA long time of waiting ensued\xe2\x80\x94no sign of the seals, but at last the\r\nwater in the hole Marbre had chosen began to bubble, and a head with\r\nlong tusks appeared. It was that of a walrus. Marbre flung his running\r\nnoose skilfully over its neck and pulled it tightly. His comrades rushed\r\nto his assistance, and with some difficulty the huge beast was dragged\r\nupon the ice, and despatched with hatchets.\r\n\r\nIt was a great success, and the colonists were delighted with this novel\r\nfishing. Other walruses were taken in the same way, and furnished plenty\r\nof oil, which, though not strictly of the right sort, did very well for\r\nthe lamps, and there was no longer any lack of light in any of the rooms\r\nof Fort Hope.\r\n\r\nThe cold was even now not very severe, and had the colonists been on the\r\nAmerican mainland they could only have rejoiced in the mildness of the\r\nwinter. They were sheltered by the chain of icebergs from the north\r\nand west winds, and the month of January passed on with the thermometer\r\nnever many degrees below freezing point, so that the sea round Victoria\r\nIsland was never frozen hard. Fissures of more or less extent broke the\r\nregularity of the surface in the offing, as was proved by the continued\r\npresence of the ruminants and furred animals near the factory, all of\r\nwhich had become strangely tame, forming in fact part of the menagerie\r\nof the colony.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s orders, all these creatures were unmolested.\r\nIt would have been useless to kill them, and a reindeer was only\r\noccasionally slaughtered to obtain a fresh supply of venison. Some of\r\nthe furred animals even ventured into the enceinte, and they were not\r\ndriven away. The martens and foxes were in all the splendour of their\r\nwinter clothing, and under ordinary circumstances would have been of\r\nimmense value. These rodents found plenty of moss under the snow, thanks\r\nto the mildness of the season, and did not therefore live upon the\r\nreserves of the factory.\r\n\r\nIt was with some apprehensions for the future that the end of the\r\nwinter was awaited, but Mrs Barnett did all in her power to brighten the\r\nmonotonous existence of her companions in exile.\r\n\r\nOnly one incident occurred in the month of January, and that one was\r\ndistressing enough. On the 7th, Michael Mac-Nab was taken ill\xe2\x80\x94severe\r\nheadache, great thirst and alternations of shivering and fever, soon\r\nreduced the poor little fellow to a sad state. His mother and father,\r\nand indeed all his friends, were in very great trouble. No one knew what\r\nto do, as it was impossible to say what his illness was, but Madge, who\r\nretained her senses about her, advised cooling drinks and poultices.\r\nKalumah was indefatigable, remaining day and night by her favourite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedside, and refusing to take any rest.\r\n\r\nAbout the third day there was no longer any doubt as to the nature of\r\nthe malady. A rash came out all over the child\xe2\x80\x99s body, and it was\r\nevident that he had malignant scarlatina, which would certainly produce\r\ninternal inflammation.\r\n\r\nChildren of a year old are rarely attacked with this terrible disease,\r\nbut cases do occasionally occur. The medicine-chest of the factory was\r\nnecessarily insufficiently stocked, but Madge, who had nursed several\r\npatients through scarlet lever, remembered that tincture of belladonna\r\nwas recommended, and administered one or two drops to the little invalid\r\nevery day. The greatest care was taken lest he should catch cold; he\r\nwas at once removed to his parents\xe2\x80\x99 room, and the rash soon came out\r\nfreely. Tiny red points appeared on his tongue, his lips, and even on\r\nthe globes of his eyes. Two days later his skin assumed a violet hue,\r\nthen it became white and fell off in scales.\r\n\r\nIt was now that double care was required to combat the great internal\r\ninflammation, which proved the severity of the attack, Nothing was\r\nneglected, the boy was, in fact, admirably nursed, and on the 20th\r\nJanuary, twelve days after he was taken ill, he was pronounced out of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nGreat was the joy in the factory. The baby was the child of the fort,\r\nof the regiment! He was born in the terrible northern latitudes, in the\r\ncolony itself, he had been named Michael Hope, and he had come to be\r\nregarded as a kind of talisman in the dangers and difficulties around,\r\nand all felt sure that God would not take him from them.\r\n\r\nPoor Kalumah would certainly not have survived him had he died, but\r\nhe gradually recovered, and fresh hope seemed to come back when he was\r\nrestored to the little circle.\r\n\r\nThe 23d of January was now reached, after all these distressing\r\nalternations of hope and fear. The situation of Victoria Island had\r\nnot changed in the least, and it was still wrapped in the gloom of the\r\napparently interminable Polar night. Snow fell abundantly for some days,\r\nand was piled up on the ground to the height of two feet.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th a somewhat alarming visit was received at the fort. The\r\nsoldiers Belcher and Pond, when on guard in front of the enceinte in\r\nthe morning, saw a huge bear quietly advancing towards the fort. They\r\nhurried into the large room, and told Mrs Barnett of the approach of the\r\nformidable carnivorous beast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is only our bear again,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Barnett to Hobson,\r\nand accompanied by him, and followed by the Sergeant, Sabine, and some\r\nsoldiers provided with guns,\xe2\x80\x94he fearlessly walked to the postern.\r\n\r\nThe bear was now about two hundred paces off, and was walking along\r\nwithout hesitation, as if he had some settled plan in view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cit is your bear, Kalumah, your\r\npreserver!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t kill my bear!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young Esquimaux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall not be killed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t injure\r\nhim, my good fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to the men, \xe2\x80\x9che will probably return\r\nas he came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose he intends coming into the enceinte?\xe2\x80\x9d said Long, who\r\nhad his doubts as to the friendly propensities of Polar bears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him come, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9che is a prisoner like\r\nourselves, and you know prisoners\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t eat each other,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hobson. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue, but only when they\r\nbelong to the same species For your sake, however, we will spare this\r\nfellow-sufferer, and only defend ourselves if he attack us. I think,\r\nhowever, it will be as prudent to go back to the House. We must not put\r\ntoo strong a temptation in the way of our carnivorous friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was certainly good advice, and all returned to the large room, the\r\nwindows were closed, but not the shutters.\r\n\r\nThrough the panes the movements of the visitor were watched. The bear,\r\nfinding the postern unfastened, quietly pushed open the door, looked\r\nin, carefully examined the premises, and finally entered the enceinte.\r\nHaving reached the centre, he examined the buildings around him, went\r\ntowards the reindeer stable and dog-house, listened for a moment to the\r\nhowlings of the dogs and the uneasy noises made by the reindeer, then\r\ncontinued his walk round the palisade, and at last came and leant his\r\ngreat head against one of the windows of the large room.\r\n\r\nTo own the truth everybody started back, several of the soldiers seized\r\ntheir guns, and Sergeant Long began to fear he had let the joke go too\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nBut Kalumah came forward, and looked through the thin partition with her\r\nsweet eyes. The bear seemed to recognise her, at least so she thought,\r\nand doubtless satisfied with his inspection, he gave a hearty growl, and\r\nturning away left the enceinte, as Hobson had prophesied, as he entered\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis was the bear\xe2\x80\x99s first and last visit to the fort, and on his\r\ndeparture everything went on as quietly as before.\r\n\r\nThe little boy\xe2\x80\x99s recovery progressed favourably, and at the end of the\r\nmonth he was as rosy and as bright as ever.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the 3rd of February, the northern horizon was touched with\r\na faint glimmer of light which did not fade away for an hour, and the\r\nyellow disc of the sun appeared for an instant for the first time since\r\nthe commencement of the long Polar night.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. THE LAST EXPLORING EXPEDITION. From this date, February\r\n3rd, the sun rose each day higher above the horizon, the nights were,\r\nhowever, still very long, and, as is often the case in February, the\r\ncold increased, the thermometer marking only 1\xc2\xba Fahrenheit, the lowest\r\ntemperature experienced throughout this extraordinary winter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen does the thaw commence in these northern seas?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs\r\nBarnett of the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn ordinary seasons,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ice does not break up\r\nuntil early in May; but the winter has been so mild that unless a very\r\nhard frost should now set in, the thaw may commence at the beginning of\r\nApril. At least that is my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall still have two months\r\nto wait then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, two months, for it would not be prudent to launch our boat too\r\nsoon amongst the floating ice; and I think our best plan will be to wait\r\nuntil our island has reached the narrowest part of Behring Strait, which\r\nis not more than two hundred miles wide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett, considerably surprised\r\nat the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s reply. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you forgotten that it was the\r\nKamtchatka Current which brought us where we now are, and which may\r\nseize us again when the thaw sets in and carry us yet farther north?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think it will, madam; indeed I feel quite sure that that\r\nwill not happen. The thaw always takes place in from north to south, and\r\nalthough the Kamtchatka Current runs the other way, the ice always goes\r\ndown the Behring Current. Other reasons there are for my opinion which\r\nI cannot now enumerate. But the icebergs invariably drift towards the\r\nPacific, and are there melted by its warmer waters. Ask Kalumah if I am\r\nnot right. She knows these latitudes well, and will tell you that the\r\nthaw always proceeds from the north to the south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKalumah when questioned confirmed all that the Lieutenant had said, so\r\nthat it appeared probable that the island would be drifted to the south\r\nlike a huge ice-floe, that is to say, to the narrowest part of Behring\r\nStrait, which is much frequented in the summer by the fishermen of New\r\nArchangel, who are the most experienced mariners of those waters.\r\nMaking allowance for all delays they might then hope to set foot on the\r\ncontinent before May, and although the cold had not been very intense\r\nthere was every reason to believe that the foundations of Victoria\r\nIsland had been thickened and strengthened by a fresh accumulation of\r\nice at the base, and that it would hold together for several months to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThere was then nothing for the colonists to do but to wait\r\npatiently,\xe2\x80\x94still to wait!\r\n\r\nThe convalescence of little Michael continued to progress favourably. On\r\nthe 20th of February he went out for the first time, forty days after\r\nhe was taken ill. By this we mean that he went from his bedroom into the\r\nlarge room, where he was petted and made much of. His mother, acting by\r\nMadge\xe2\x80\x99s advice, put off weaning him for some little time, and he soon\r\ngot back his strength. The soldiers had made many little toys for him\r\nduring his illness, and he was now as happy as any child in the wide\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe last week of February was very wet, rain and snow falling\r\nalternately. A strong wind blew from the north-west, and the temperature\r\nwas low enough for large quantities of snow to fall; the gale, however,\r\nincreased in violence, and on the side of Cape Bathurst and the chain\r\nof icebergs the noise of the tempest was deafening. The huge ice-masses\r\nwere flung against each other, and fell with a roar like that of\r\nthunder. The ice on the north was compressed and piled up on the\r\nshores of the island. There really seemed to be a danger that the cape\r\nitself-which was but a kind of iceberg capped with earth and sand-would\r\nbe flung down.\r\n\r\nSome large pieces of ice, in spite of their weight, were driven to the\r\nvery foot of the palisaded enceinte; but fortunately for the factory\r\nthe cape retained its position; had it given way all the buildings must\r\ninevitably have been crushed beneath it.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily understood that the position of Victoria Island, at\r\nthe opening of a narrow strait about which the ice accumulated in large\r\nquantities, was extremely perilous, for it might at any time be swept by\r\na horizontal avalanche, or crushed beneath the huge blocks of ice driven\r\ninland from the offing, and so become engulfed before the thaw. This\r\nwas a new danger to be added to all the others already threatening the\r\nlittle band. Mrs Barnett, seeing the awful power of the pressure in the\r\noffing, and the violence with which the moving masses of ice crushed\r\nupon each other, realised the full magnitude of the peril they would\r\nall be in when the thaw commenced. She often mentioned her fears to the\r\nLieutenant, and he shook his head like a man who had no reply to make.\r\n\r\nEarly in March the squall ceased, and the full extent of the\r\ntransformation of the ice-field was revealed. It seemed as if by a kind\r\nof glissade the chain of icebergs had drawn nearer to the island. In\r\nsome parts it was not two miles distant, and it advanced like a glacier\r\non the move, with the difference that the latter has a descending\r\nand the ice-wall a horizontal motion. Between the lofty chain of\r\nice-mountains the ice-field was fearfully distorted: strewn with\r\nhummocks, broken obelisks, shattered blocks, overturned pyramids, it\r\nresembled a tempest-tossed sea or a ruined town, in which not a building\r\nor a monument had remained standing, and above it all the mighty\r\nicebergs reared their snowy crests, standing out against the sky with\r\ntheir pointed peaks, their rugged cones, and solid buttresses, forming a\r\nfitting frame for the weird fantastic landscape at their feet.\r\n\r\nAt this date the little vessel was quite finished. This boat was rather\r\nheavy in shape, as might have been expected, but she did credit to\r\nMac-Nab, and shaped as she was like a barge at the bows, she ought the\r\nbetter to withstand the shocks of the floating ice. She might have\r\nbeen taken for one of those Dutch boats which venture upon the northern\r\nwaters. Her rig, which was completed, consisted, like that of a cutter,\r\nof a mainsail and a jib carried on a single mast. The tent canvass of\r\nthe factory had been made use of for sailcloth.\r\n\r\nThis boat would carry the whole colony, and if, as the Lieutenant hoped,\r\nthe island were drifted to Behring Strait, the vessel would easily make\r\nher way to land, even from the widest part of the passage. There was\r\nthen nothing to be done but wait for the thaw.\r\n\r\nHobson now decided to make a long excursion to the south to ascertain\r\nthe state of the ice-field, to see whether there were any signs of its\r\nbreaking up, to examine the chain of icebergs by which it was hemmed in,\r\nto make sure, in short, whether it would really be useless to attempt to\r\ncross to the American continent. Many incidents might occur, many fresh\r\ndangers might arise before the thaw, and it would therefore be but\r\nprudent to make a reconnaissance on the ice-field.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was organised and the start fixed for March 7th. Hobson,\r\nMrs Barnett, Kalumah, Marbre, and Sabine were to go, and, if the route\r\nshould be practicable, they would try and find a passage across the\r\nchain of icebergs. In any case, however, they were not to be absent for\r\nmore than forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nA good stock of provisions was prepared, and, well provided for every\r\ncontingency, the little party left Fort Hope on the morning of the 7th\r\nMarch aid turned towards Cape Michael.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer then marked 32\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit. The atmosphere was misty,\r\nbut the weather was perfectly calm. The sun was now above the horizon\r\nfor seven or eight hours a day, and its oblique rays afforded plenty of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, after a short halt, the party descended the slope of\r\nCape Michael and made their way across the ice-fields in a southeasterly\r\ndirection. On this side the ice wall rose not three miles from the cape.\r\n\r\nThe march was of course very slow. Every minute a crevasse had to be\r\nturned, or a hummock too high to be climbed. It was evident that a\r\nsledge could not have got over the rough distorted surface, which\r\nconsisted of an accumulation of blocks of ice of every shape and size,\r\nsome of which really seemed to retain their equilibrium by a miracle.\r\nOthers had been but recently overturned, as could be seen from the\r\nclearly cut fractures and sharp corners. Not a sign was to be seen of\r\nany living creature, no footprints told of the passage of man or beast,\r\nand the very birds had deserted these awful solitudes.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett was astonished at the scene before her, and asked the\r\nLieutenant how they could possibly have crossed the ice-fields if they\r\nhad started in December, and he replied by reminding her that it\r\nwas then in a very different condition; the enormous pressure of the\r\nadvancing icebergs had not then commenced, the surface of the sea\r\nwas comparatively even, and the only danger was from its insufficient\r\nsolidification. The irregularities which now barred their passage did\r\nnot exist early in the winter.\r\n\r\nThey managed, however, to advance towards the mighty ice-wall, Kalumah\r\ngenerally leading the way. Like a chamois on the Alpine rocks, the\r\nyoung girl firmly treaded the ice-masses with a swiftness of foot and an\r\nabsence of hesitation which was really marvellous. She knew by instinct\r\nthe best way through the labyrinth of icebergs, and was an unerring\r\nguide to her companions.\r\n\r\nAbout noon the base of the ice-wall was reached, but it had taken three\r\nhours to get over three miles.\r\n\r\nThe icy barrier presented a truly imposing appearance, rising as it did\r\nmore than four hundred feet above the ice-field. The various strata of\r\nwhich it was formed were clearly defined, and the glistening surface was\r\ntinged with many a delicately-shaded hue. Jasper-like ribbons of green\r\nand blue alternated with streaks and dashes of all the colours of the\r\nrainbow, strewn with enamelled arabesques, sparkling crystals, and\r\ndelicate ice-flowers. No cliff, however strangely distorted, could give\r\nany idea of this marvellous half opaque, half transparent ice-wall,\r\nand no description could do justice to the wonderful effects of\r\nchiara-oscuro produced upon it.\r\n\r\nIt would not do, however, to approach too near to these beetling cliffs,\r\nthe solidity of which was very doubtful. Internal fractures and rents\r\nwere already commencing, the work of destruction and decomposition\r\nwas proceeding rapidly, aided by the imprisoned air-bubbles; and the\r\nfragility of the huge structure, built up by the cold, was manifest to\r\nevery eye. It could not survive the Arctic winter, it was doomed to melt\r\nbeneath the sunbeams, and it contained material enough to feed large\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson had warned his companions of the danger of the\r\navalanches which constantly fall from the summits of the icebergs, and\r\nthey did not therefore go far along their base. That this prudence was\r\nnecessary was proved by the falling of a huge block, at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nat the entrance to a kind of valley which they were about to cross. It\r\nmust have weighed more than a hundred tons, and it was dashed upon the\r\nice-field with a fearful crash, bursting like a bomb-shell. Fortunately\r\nno one was hurt by the splinters.\r\n\r\nFrom two to five o\xe2\x80\x99clock the explorers followed a narrow winding path\r\nleading down amongst the icebergs; they were anxious to know if it led\r\nright through them, but could not at once ascertain. In this valley, as\r\nit might be called, they were able to examine the internal structure of\r\nthe icy barrier. The blocks of which it was built up were here arranged\r\nwith greater symmetry than outside. In some places trunks of trees were\r\nseen embedded in the ice, all, however, of Tropical not Polar species,\r\nwhich had evidently been brought to Arctic regions by the Gulf Stream,\r\nand would be taken back to the ocean when the thaw should have converted\r\ninto water the ice which now held them in its chill embrace.\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock it became too dark to go any further. The travellers\r\nhad not gone more than about two miles in the valley, but it was\r\nso sinuous, that it was impossible to estimate exactly the distance\r\ntraversed.\r\n\r\nThe signal to halt was given by the Lieutenant, and Marbre and Sabine\r\nquickly dug out a grotto in the ice with their chisels, into which the\r\nwhole party crept, and after a good supper all were soon asleep.\r\n\r\nEvery one was up at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning, and Hobson decided\r\nto follow the valley for another mile, in the hope of finding out\r\nwhether it went right through the ice-wall. The direction of the pass,\r\njudging from the position of the sun, had now changed from north to\r\nsouth east, and as early as eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the party came out on the\r\nopposite side of the chain of icebergs. The passage was therefore proved\r\nto run completely through the barrier.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the ice-field on the eastern side was exactly similar\r\nto that on the west. The same confusion of ice-masses, the same\r\naccumulation of hummocks and icebergs, as far as the eye could reach,\r\nwith occasional alternations of smooth surfaces of small extent,\r\nintersected by numerous crevasses, the edges of which were already\r\nmelting fast. The same complete solitude, the same desertion, not a\r\nbird, not an animal to be seen.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett climbed to the top of the hummock, and there remained for an\r\nhour, gazing upon the sad and desolate Polar landscape before her. Her\r\nthoughts involuntarily flew back to the miserable attempt to escape that\r\nhad been made five months before. Once more she saw the men and women of\r\nthe hapless caravan encamped in the darkness of these frozen solitudes,\r\nor struggling against insurmountable difficulties to reach the mainland.\r\n\r\nAt last the Lieutenant broke in upon her reverie, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, it is more than twenty-four hours since we left the fort. We\r\nnow know the thickness of the ice-wall, and as we promised not to be\r\naway longer than forty-eight hours, I think it is time to retrace our\r\nsteps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett saw the justice of the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s remark. They had\r\nascertained that the barrier of ice was of moderate thickness, that it\r\nwould melt away quickly enough to allow of the passage of Mac-Nab\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboat after the thaw, and it would therefore be well to hasten back lest\r\na snow-storm or change in the weather of any kind should render return\r\nthrough the winding valley difficult.\r\n\r\nThe party breakfasted and set out on the return journey about one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M.\r\n\r\nThe night was passed as before in an ice-cavern, and the route resumed\r\nat eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning, March 9th.\r\n\r\nThe travellers now turned their backs upon the sun, as they were making\r\nfor the west, but the weather was fine, and the orb of day, already high\r\nin the heavens, flung some of its rays across the valley and lit up the\r\nglittering ice-walls on either side.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and Kalumah were a little behind the rest of the party\r\nchatting together, and looking about them as they wound through the\r\nnarrow passages pointed out by Marbre and Sabine. They expected to get\r\nout of the valley quickly, and be back at the fort before sunset, as\r\nthey had only two or three miles of the island to cross after leaving\r\nthe ice. This would be a few hours after the time fixed, but not long\r\nenough to cause any serious anxiety to their friends at home.\r\n\r\nThey made their calculation without allowing for an incident which no\r\nhuman perspicacity could possibly have foreseen.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Marbre and Sabine, who were some twenty\r\npaces in advance of the rest, suddenly stopped and appeared to be\r\ndebating some point. When the others came up, Sabine was holding out\r\nhis compass to Marbre, who was staring at it with an expression of the\r\nutmost astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an extraordinary thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, and added, turning to\r\nthe Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me, sir, the position of the island with regard to the\r\nice-wall, is it on the east or west?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the west,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, not a little surprised at the\r\nquestion, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that well enough, Marbre\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it well enough! I know it well enough!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Marbre,\r\nshaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cand if it is on the west, we are going wrong, and\r\naway from the inland!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, away from the island!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Lieutenant, struck with\r\nthe hunter\xe2\x80\x99s air of conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marbre; \xe2\x80\x9clook at the compass; my name\r\nis not Marbre if it does not show that we are walking towards the east\r\nnot the west!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sabine.\r\n\r\nIt was true. The needle pointed in exactly the opposite direction to\r\nthat expected. Hobson looked thoughtful and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have made a mistake when we left the ice cavern this\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sabine, \xe2\x80\x9cwe ought to have turned to the left\r\ninstead of to the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure we did not make a\r\nmistake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94said Marbre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9clook at the sun. Does it no\r\nlonger rise in the east? Now as we turned our backs on it this morning,\r\nand it is still behind us, we must be walking towards the west, so\r\nthat when we get out of the valley on the western side of the chain of\r\nicebergs, we must come to the island we left there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarbre, struck dumb by this irrefutable argument, crossed his arms and\r\nsaid no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sabine, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sun and the compass are in\r\ncomplete contradiction of each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cand the reason is simple\r\nenough; in these high northern latitudes, and in latitudes in the\r\nneighbourhood of the magnetic pole, the compasses are sometimes\r\ndisturbed, and the deviation of their needles is so great as entirely to\r\nmislead travellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marbre, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have only to go on keeping our\r\nbacks to the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lieutenant Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cthere can be no\r\nhesitation which to choose, the sun or our compass, nothing disturbs the\r\nsun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe march was resumed, the sun was still behind them, and there was\r\nreally no objection to be made to Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s theory, founded, as it was,\r\nupon the position then occupied by the radiant orb of day.\r\n\r\nThe little troop marched on, but they did not get out of the valley as\r\nsoon as they expected. Hobson had counted on leaving the ice-wall before\r\nnoon, and it was past two when they reached the opening of the narrow\r\npass.\r\n\r\nStrange as was this delay, it had not made any one uneasy, and the\r\nastonishment of all can readily be imagined when, on stepping on to the\r\nice field, at the base of the chain of icebergs, no sign was to be seen\r\nof Victoria Island, which ought to have been opposite to them.\r\n\r\nYes!\xe2\x80\x94The island, which on this side had been such a conspicuous\r\nobject, owing to the height of Cape Michael crowned with trees, had\r\ndisappeared. In its place stretched a vast ice-field lit up by the\r\nsunbeams.\r\n\r\nAll looked around them, and then at each other in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe island ought to be there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sabine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marbre. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir\xe2\x80\x94Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nis it? what has become of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Hobson had not a word to say in reply, and Mrs Barnett was equally\r\ndumfounded.\r\n\r\nKalumah now approached Lieutenant Hobson, and touching his arm, she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went wrong in the valley, we went up it instead of down it, we\r\nshall only get back to where we were yesterday by crossing the chain of\r\nicebergs. Come, come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson and the others mechanically followed Kalumah, and trusting in\r\nthe young native\xe2\x80\x99s sagacity, retraced their steps. Appearances were,\r\nhowever, certainly against her, for they were now walking towards the\r\nsun in an easterly direction.\r\n\r\nKalumah did not explain her motives, but muttered as she went along\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us make haste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll were quite exhausted, and could scarcely get along, when they found\r\nthemselves on the other side of the ice-wall, after a walk of three\r\nhours. The night had now fallen, and it was too dark to see if the\r\nisland was there, but they were not long left in doubt.\r\n\r\nAt about a hundred paces off, burning torches were moving about, whilst\r\nreports of guns and shouts were heard.\r\n\r\nThe explorers replied, and were soon joined by Sergeant Long and others,\r\namongst them Thomas Black, whose anxiety as to the fate of his friends\r\nhad at last roused him from his torpor. The poor fellows left on the\r\nisland had been in a terrible state of uneasiness, thinking that Hobson\r\nand his party had lost their way. They were right, but what was it that\r\nhad made them think so?\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours before, the immense ice-field and the island had\r\nturned half round, and in consequence of this displacement they were no\r\nlonger on the west, but on the east of the ice-wall!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI THE BREAK-UP OF THE ICE Two hours later all had returned to\r\nFort Hope, and the next day the sun for the first time shone upon that\r\npart of the coast which was formerly on the west of the island. Kalumah,\r\nto whom this phenomenon was familiar, had been right, and if the sun had\r\nnot been the guilty party neither had the compass!\r\n\r\nThe position of Victoria Island with regard to the cardinal points was\r\nagain completely changed. Since it had broken loose from the mainland\r\nthe island\xe2\x80\x94and not only the island, but the vast ice field in which it\r\nwas enclosed\xe2\x80\x94had turned half round. This displacement proved that the\r\nice-field was not connected with the continent, and that the thaw would\r\nsoon set in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cthis change of front is\r\ncertainly in our favour. Cape Bathurst and Fort Hope are now turned\r\ntowards the north-east, in other words towards the point nearest to the\r\ncontinent, and the ice-wall, through which our boat could only have made\r\nits way by a difficult and dangerous passage, is no longer between\r\nus and America. And so all is for the best, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs.\r\nBarnett with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, who fully realised all that was\r\ninvolved in this change of the position of Victoria Island.\r\n\r\nNo incident occurred between the 10th and 21st March, but there were\r\nindications of the approaching change of season. The temperature varied\r\nfrom 43\xc2\xb0 to 50\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit, and it appeared likely that the breaking\r\nup of the ice would commence suddenly. Fresh crevasses opened, and the\r\nunfrozen water flooded the surface of the ice. As the whalers poetically\r\nexpress it, the \xe2\x80\x9cwounds of the ice-field bled copiously,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nopening of these \xe2\x80\x9cwounds\xe2\x80\x9d was accompanied by a sound like the roar\r\nof artillery. A warm rain fell for several hours, and accelerated the\r\ndissolution of the solid coating of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe birds, ptarmigans, puffins, ducks, &c., which had deserted the\r\nisland in the beginning of the winter, now returned in large numbers.\r\nMarbre and Sabine killed a few of them, and on some were found the\r\ntickets tied round their necks by the Lieutenant several months before.\r\nFlocks of white trumpeter swans also reappeared, and filled the air with\r\ntheir loud clarion tones; whilst the quadrupeds, rodents, and carnivora\r\nalike continued to frequent the vicinity of the fort like tame domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nWhenever the state of the sky permitted, which was almost every day,\r\nHobson took the altitude of the sun. Sometimes Mrs Barnett, who had\r\nbecome quite expert in handling the sextant, assisted him, or took the\r\nobservation in his stead. It was now most important to note the very\r\nslightest changes in the latitude and longitude of the island. It was\r\nstill doubtful to which current it would be subject after the thaw, and\r\nthe question whether it would be drifted north or south was the chief\r\nsubject of the discussions between the Lieutenant and Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\nThe brave lady had always given proof of an energy superior to that of\r\nmost of her sex, and now she was to be seen every day braving fatigue,\r\nand venturing on to the half decomposed, or \xe2\x80\x9cpancake\xe2\x80\x9d ice, in all\r\nweathers, through snow or rain, and on her return to the factory ready\r\nto cheer and help everybody, and to superintend all that was going on.\r\nWe must add that her efforts were ably seconded by the faithful Madge.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett had compelled herself to look the future firmly in the face,\r\nand although she could not fail to fear for the safety of all, and\r\nsad presentiments haunted her, she never allowed herself to betray any\r\nuneasiness. Her courage and confidence never seemed to waver, she was\r\nas ever the kind encouraging friend of each and all, and none could have\r\ndreamt of the conflict of spirit going on beneath her quiet exterior\r\ndemeanour. Lieutenant Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s admiration of her character was\r\nunbounded, and he had also entire confidence in Kalumah, often trusting\r\nto her natural instinct as implicitly as a hunter to that of his dog.\r\n\r\nThe young Esquimaux was, in fact, very intelligent, and familiar from\r\nbabyhood with the phenomena of the Polar regions. On board a whaler she\r\nmight have advantageously replaced many an ice-master or pilot whose\r\nbusiness it is to guide a boat amongst the ice.\r\n\r\nEvery day Kalumah went to examine the state of the ice-field.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the noise produced by the breaking of the icebergs in the\r\ndistance was enough to tell her how far the decomposition had advanced.\r\nNo foot was surer than hers upon the ice, no one could spring more\r\nlightly forwards than she when her instinct told her that the smooth\r\nsurface was rotten underneath, and she would scud across an ice-field\r\nriddled with fissures without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\nFrom the 20th to the 30th March, the thaw made rapid progress. Rain\r\nfell abundantly and accelerated the dissolution of the ice. It was to be\r\nhoped that the ice-field would soon open right across, and that in about\r\nfifteen days Hobson would be able to steer his boat into the open sea.\r\nHe was determined to lose no time, as he did not know but that the\r\nKamtchatka Current might sweep the island to the north before it could\r\ncome under the influence of the Behring Current.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d Kalumah repeated again and again, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no fear of\r\nthat, the breaking up of the ice does not proceed upwards but downwards.\r\nThe danger is there!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, pointing to the south in the\r\ndirection of the vast Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe young girl\xe2\x80\x99s confidence on this point reassured Hobson, for he had\r\nno reason now to dread the falling to pieces of the island in the warm\r\nwaters of the Pacific. He meant everybody to be on board the boat before\r\nthat could happen, and they would not have far to go to get to one\r\nor the other continent, as the strait is in reality a kind of funnel\r\nthrough which the waters flow between Cape East on the Asiatic side and\r\nCape Prince of Wales on the American.\r\n\r\nThis will explain the eager attention with which the slightest change\r\nin the position of the island was noticed. The bearings were taken every\r\nday, and everything was prepared for an approaching and perhaps sudden\r\nand hurried embarkation.\r\n\r\nOf course all the ordinary avocations of the factory were now\r\ndiscontinued. There was no hunting or setting of traps. The magazines\r\nwere already piled up with furs, most of which would be lost. The\r\nhunters and trappers had literally nothing to do; but Mac-Nab and\r\nhis men, having finished their boat, employed their leisure time in\r\nstrengthening the principal house of the fort, which would probably be\r\nsubjected to considerable pressure from the accumulation of ice on\r\nthe coast during the further progress of the thaw, unless indeed Cape\r\nBathurst should prove a sufficient protection. Strong struts were fixed\r\nagainst the outside walls, vertical props were placed inside the rooms\r\nto afford additional support to the beams of the ceiling, and the roof\r\nwas strengthened so that it could bear a considerable weight. These\r\nvarious works were completed early in April, and their utility, or\r\nrather their vital importance, was very soon manifested.\r\n\r\nEach day brought fresh symptoms of returning spring, which seemed likely\r\nto set in early after this strangely mild Polar winter. A few tender\r\nshoots appeared upon the trees, and the newly-thawed sap swelled the\r\nbark of beeches, willows, and arbutus. Tiny mosses tinged with pale\r\ngreen the slopes under the direct influence of the sunbeams; but they\r\nwere not likely to spread much, as the greedy rodents collected about\r\nthe fort pounced upon and devoured them almost before they were above\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nGreat were the sufferings of Corporal Joliffe at this time. We know that\r\nhe had undertaken to protect the plot of ground cultivated by his wife.\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances he would merely have had to drive away\r\nfeathered pilferers, such as guillemots or puffins, from his sorrel and\r\nscurvy grass. A scarecrow would have been enough to get rid of them,\r\nstill more the Corporal in person. But now all the rodents and ruminants\r\nof the Arctic fauna combined to lay siege to his territory; reindeer,\r\nPolar hares, musk-rats, shrews, martens, &c., braved all the threatening\r\ngestures of the Corporal, and the poor man was in despair, for whilst he\r\nwas defending one end of his field the enemy was preying upon the other.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly have been wiser to let the poor creatures enjoy\r\nunmolested the crops which could be of no use to the colonists, as the\r\nfort was to be so soon abandoned, and Mrs Barnett tried to persuade the\r\nangry Corporal to do so, when he came to her twenty times a day with the\r\nsame wearisome tale, but he would not listen to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo lose the fruit of all our trouble!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated; \xe2\x80\x9cto leave an\r\nestablishment which was prospering so well! To give up the plants Mrs\r\nJoliffe and I sowed so carefully!... O madam, sometimes I feel disposed\r\nto let you all go, and stay here with my wife! I am sure the Company\r\nwould give up all claim on the island to us\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett could not help laughing at this absurd speech, and sent the\r\nCorporal to his little wife, who had long ago resigned herself to the\r\nloss of her sorrel, scurvy grass, and other medicinal herbs.\r\n\r\nWe must here remark, that the health of all the colonists remained good,\r\nthey had at least escaped illness; the baby, too, was now quite well\r\nagain, and throve admirably in the mild weather of the early spring.\r\n\r\nThe thaw continued to proceed rapidly from the 2nd to the 5th April. The\r\nweather was warm but cloudy, and rain fell frequently in large drops.\r\nThe wind blew from the south west, and was laden with the heated dust\r\nof the continent. Unfortunately the sky was so hazy, that it was quite\r\nimpossible to take observations, neither sun, moon, nor stars could be\r\nseen through the heavy mists, and this was the more provoking, as it\r\nwas of the greatest importance to note the slightest movements of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIt was on the night of the 7th April that the actual breaking up of the\r\nice commenced. In the morning the Lieutenant, Mrs Barnett, Kalumah, and\r\nSergeant Long, had climbed to the summit of Cape Bathurst, and saw\r\nthat a great change had taken place in the chain of icebergs. The huge\r\nbarrier had parted nearly in the middle, and now formed two separate\r\nmasses, the larger of which seemed to be moving northwards.\r\n\r\nWas it the Kamtchatka Current which produced this motion? Would the\r\nfloating island take the same direction? The intense anxiety of the\r\nLieutenant and his companions can easily be imagined. Their fate might\r\nnow be decided in a few hours, and if they should be drifted some\r\nhundred miles to the north, it would be very difficult to reach the\r\ncontinent in a vessel so small as theirs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it was impossible to ascertain the nature or extent of the\r\ndisplacement which was going on. One thing was, however, evident, the\r\nisland was not yet moving, at least not in the same direction as the\r\nice-wall. It therefore seemed probable that whilst part of the ice field\r\nwas floating to the north, that portion immediately surrounding the\r\nisland still remained stationary.\r\n\r\nThis displacement of the icebergs did not in the least alter the opinion\r\nof the young Esquimaux. Kalumah still maintained that the thaw would\r\nproceed from north to south, and that the ice wall would shortly feel\r\nthe influence of the Behring Current. To make herself more easily\r\nunderstood, she traced the direction of the current on the sand with\r\na little piece of wood, and made signs that in following it the island\r\nmust approach the American continent. No argument could shake her\r\nconviction on this point, and it was almost impossible not to feel\r\nreassured when listening to the confident expressions of the intelligent\r\nnative girl.\r\n\r\nThe events of the 8th, 9th, and 10th April, seemed, however, to prove\r\nKalumah to be in the wrong. The northern portion of the chain of\r\nicebergs drifted farther and farther north. The breaking up of the ice\r\nproceeded rapidly and with a great noise, and the ice field opened all\r\nround the island with a deafening crash. Out of doors it was impossible\r\nto hear one\xe2\x80\x99s self speak, a ceaseless roar like that of artillery\r\ndrowned every other sound.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile from the coast on that part of the island overlooked\r\nby Cape Bathurst, the blocks of ice were already beginning to crowd\r\ntogether, and to pile themselves upon each other. The ice-wall had\r\nbroken up into numerous separate icebergs, which were drifting towards\r\nthe north. At least it seemed as if they were moving in that direction.\r\nHobson became more and more uneasy, and nothing that Kalumah could say\r\nreassured him. He replied by counter-arguments, which could not shake\r\nher faith in her own belief.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the morning of the 11th April, Hobson showed Kalumah the\r\nlast icebergs disappearing in the north, and again endeavoured to prove\r\nto her that facts were against her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kalumah, with an air of greater conviction than\r\never, \xe2\x80\x9cno, the icebergs are not going to the north, but our island is\r\ngoing to the south!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe might perhaps be right after all, and Hobson was much struck by\r\nthis last reply. It was really possible that the motion of the icebergs\r\ntowards the north was only apparent, and that Victoria Island, dragged\r\nalong with the ice-field, was drifting towards the strait. But it was\r\nimpossible to ascertain whether this were really the case, as neither\r\nthe latitude nor longitude could be taken.\r\n\r\nThe situation was aggravated by a phenomenon peculiar to the Polar\r\nregions, which rendered it still darker and more impossible to take\r\nobservations of any kind.\r\n\r\nAt the very time of the breaking up of the ice, the temperature fell\r\nseveral degrees. A dense mist presently enveloped the Arctic latitudes,\r\nbut not an ordinary mist. The soil was covered with a white crust,\r\ntotally distinct from hoar-frost\xe2\x80\x94it was, in fact, a watery vapour\r\nwhich congeals on its precipitation. The minute particles of which this\r\nmist was composed formed a thick layer on trees, shrubs, the walls of\r\nthe fort, and any projecting surface which bristled with pyramidal or\r\nprismatic crystals, the apexes of which pointed to the wind.\r\n\r\nHobson at once understood the nature of this atmospheric phenomenon,\r\nwhich whalers and explorers have often noticed in the spring in the\r\nPolar regions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a mist or fog,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his companions, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98frost-rime\xe2\x80\x99, a dense vapour which remains in a state of complete\r\ncongelation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut whether a fog or a frozen mist this phenomenon was none the less to\r\nbe regretted, for it rose a hundred feet at least above the level of the\r\nsea, and it was so opaque that the colonists could not see each other\r\nwhen only two or three paces apart.\r\n\r\nEvery one\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment was very great. Nature really seemed\r\ndetermined to try them to the uttermost. When the break up of the ice\r\nhad come at last, when the wandering island was to leave the spot in\r\nwhich it had so long been imprisoned, and its movements ought to be\r\nwatched with the greatest care, this fog prevented all observations.\r\n\r\nThis state of things continued for four days. The frost-rime did not\r\ndisappear until the 15th April, but on the morning of that date a strong\r\nwind from the south rent it open and dispersed it.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone brightly once more, and Hobson eagerly seized his\r\ninstruments. He took the altitude, and found that the exact position of\r\nVictoria Island was then: Latitude, 69\xc2\xb0 57\xe2\x80\x99; longitude, 179\xc2\xb0 33\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nKalumah was right, Victoria Island, in the grasp of the Behring Current,\r\nwas drifting towards the south.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. THE AVALANCHE. The colonists were then at last approaching\r\nthe more frequented latitudes of Behring Sea. There was no longer any\r\ndanger that they would be drifted to the north, and all they had to do\r\nwas to watch the displacement of the island, and to estimate the speed\r\nof its motion, which would probably be very unequal, on account of\r\nthe obstacles in its path. Hobson most carefully noted every incident,\r\ntaking alternately solar and stellar altitudes, and the next day, April\r\n16th, after ascertaining the bearings, he calculated that if its present\r\nspeed were maintained, Victoria Island would reach the Arctic Circle,\r\nfrom which it was now separated at the most by four degrees of latitude,\r\ntowards the beginning of May.\r\n\r\nIt was probable that, when the island reached the narrowest portion of\r\nthe strait, it would remain stationary until the thaw broke it up, the\r\nboat would then be launched, and the colonists would set sail for the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready for an immediate embarkation, and the inhabitants\r\nof the island waited with greater patience and confidence than ever.\r\nThey felt, poor things, that the end of their trials was surely near at\r\nlast, and that nothing could prevent their landing on one side or the\r\nother of the strait in a few days.\r\n\r\nThis prospect cheered them up wonderfully, and the gaiety natural to\r\nthem all, which they had lost in the terrible anxiety they had so long\r\nendured, was restored. The common meals were quite festal, as there\r\nwas no need for economising the stores under present circumstances. The\r\ninfluence of the spring became more and more sensibly felt, and every\r\none enjoyed the balmy air, and breathed more freely than before.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days, several excursions were made to the interior\r\nof the island and along the coast. Everywhere the furred animals, &c.,\r\nstill abounded, for even now they could not cross to the continent,\r\nthe connection between it and the ice-field being broken, and their\r\ncontinued presence was a fresh proof that the island was no longer\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nNo change had taken place on the island at Cape Esquimaux, Cape Michael,\r\nalong the coast, or on the wooded heights of the interior, and the banks\r\nof the lagoon. The large gulf which had opened near Cape Michael during\r\nthe storm had closed in the winter, and there was no other fissure on\r\nthe surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nDuring these excursions, bands of wolves were seen scudding across parts\r\nof the island. Of all the animals these fierce carnivorous beasts were\r\nthe only ones which the feeling of a common danger had not tamed.\r\n\r\nKalumah\xe2\x80\x99s preserver was seen several times. This worthy bear paced to\r\nand fro on the deserted plains in melancholy mood, pausing in his walk\r\nas the explorers passed, and sometimes following them to the fort,\r\nknowing well that he had nothing to fear from them.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th April Lieutenant Hobson ascertained that the wandering\r\nisland was still drifting to the south. All that remained of the\r\nice-wall, that is to say, the southern portion of the icebergs, followed\r\nit, but as there were no bench marks, the changes of position could only\r\nbe estimated by astronomical observations.\r\n\r\nHobson took several soundings in different parts of the ground,\r\nespecially at the foot of Cape Bathurst, and on the shores of the\r\nlagoon. He was anxious to ascertain the thickness of the layer of ice\r\nsupporting the earth and sand, and found that it had not increased\r\nduring the winter, and that the general level of the island did not\r\nappear to have risen higher above that of the sea. The conclusion he\r\ndrew from these facts was, that no time should be lost in getting away\r\nfrom the fragile island, which would rapidly break up and dissolve in\r\nthe warmer waters of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAbout the 25th April the bearing of the island was again changed, the\r\nwhole ice-field had moved round from east to west twelve points, so\r\nthat Cape Bathurst pointed to the north-west. The last remains of the\r\nice-wall now shut in the northern horizon, so that there could be no\r\ndoubt that the ice-field was moving freely in the strait, and that it\r\nnowhere touched any land.\r\n\r\nThe fatal moment was approaching. Diurnal or nocturnal observations gave\r\nthe exact position of the island, and consequently of the ice-field. On\r\nthe 30th of April, both were together drifting across Kotzebue Sound,\r\na large triangular gulf running some distance inland on the American\r\ncoast, and bounded on the south by Cape Prince of Wales, which might,\r\nperhaps, arrest the course of the island if it should deviate in the\r\nvery least from the middle of the narrow pass.\r\n\r\nThe weather was now pretty fine, and the column of mercury often marked\r\n50\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit. The colonists had left off their winter garments some\r\nweeks before, and held themselves in constant readiness to leave the\r\nisland. Thomas Black had already transported his instruments and books\r\ninto the boat, which was waiting on the beach. A good many provisions\r\nhad also been embarked and some of the most valuable furs.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of May a very carefully taken observation showed that Victoria\r\nIsland had a tendency to drift towards the east, and consequently to\r\nreach the American continent. This was fortunate, as they were now out\r\nof danger of being taken any farther by the Kamtchatka Current, which,\r\nas is well known, runs along the coast of Asia. At last the tide was\r\nturning in favour of the colonists!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think our bad fortune is at last at an end,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sergeant\r\nLong to Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cand that our misfortunes are really over; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose there are any more dangers to be feared now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is very\r\nfortunate that we had to give up our journey across the ice-field a few\r\nmonths ago; we ought to be very thankful that it was impassible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett was certainly justified in speaking as she did, for what\r\nfearful fatigues and sufferings they would all have had to undergo in\r\ncrossing five hundred miles of ice in the darkness of the Polar night!\r\n\r\nOn the 5th May, Hobson announced that Victoria Island had just\r\ncrossed the Arctic Circle. It had at last re-entered that zone of the\r\nterrestrial sphere in which at one period of the year the sun does not\r\nset. The poor people all felt that they were returning to the inhabited\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe event of crossing the Arctic Circle was celebrated in much the same\r\nway as crossing the Equator for the first time would be on board ship,\r\nand many a glass of spirits was drank in honour of the event.\r\n\r\nThere was now nothing left to do but to wait till the broken and\r\nhalf-melted ice should allow of the passage of the boat, which was to\r\nbear the whole colony to the land.\r\n\r\nDuring the 7th May the island turned round to the extent of another\r\nquarter of its circumference. Cape Bathurst now pointed due north, and\r\nthose masses of the old chain of icebergs which still remained standing\r\nwere now above it, so that it occupied much the same position as that\r\nassigned to it in maps when it was united to the American continent.\r\nThe island had gradually turned completely round, and the sun had risen\r\nsuccessively on every point of its shores.\r\n\r\nThe observations of the 8th May showed that the island had become\r\nstationary near the middle of the passage, at least forty miles from\r\nCape Prince of Wales, so that land was now at a comparatively short\r\ndistance from it, and the safety of all seemed to be secured.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a good supper was served in the large room, and the\r\nhealths of Mrs Barnett and of Lieutenant Hobson were proposed.\r\n\r\nThe same night the Lieutenant determined to go and see if any changes\r\nhad taken place in the ice-field on the south, hoping that a practicable\r\npassage might have been opened.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett was anxious to accompany him, but he persuaded her to rest a\r\nlittle instead, and started off, accompanied only by Sergeant Long.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett, Madge, and Kalumah returned to the principal house after\r\nseeing them off, and the soldiers and women had already gone to bed in\r\nthe different apartments assigned to them.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine night, there was no moon, but the stars shone very\r\nbrightly, and as the ice-field vividly reflected their light, it was\r\npossible to see for a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when the two explorers left the fort and turned\r\ntowards that part of the coast between Port Barnett and Cape Michael.\r\nThey followed the beach for about two miles, and found the ice-field in\r\na state of positive chaos. The sea was one vast aggregation of crystals\r\nof every size, it looked as if it had been petrified suddenly when\r\ntossing in a tempest, and, alas, there was even now no free passage\r\nbetween the ice-masses\xe2\x80\x94it would be impossible for a boat to pass yet.\r\n\r\nHobson and Long remained on the ice-field talking and looking about them\r\nuntil midnight, and then seeing that there was still nothing to do but\r\nto wait, they decided to go back to Fort Hope and rest for a few hours.\r\n\r\nThey had gone some hundred paces, and had reached the dried-up bed of\r\nPaulina River, when an unexpected noise arrested them. It was a distant\r\nrumbling from the northern part of the ice-field, and it became louder\r\nand louder until it was almost deafening. Something dreadful was going\r\non in the quarter from which it came, and Hobson fancied he felt the ice\r\nbeneath his feet trembling, which was certainly far from reassuring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe noise comes from the chain of icebergs,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Long,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat can be going on there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson did not answer, but feeling dreadfully anxious he rushed towards\r\nthe fort dragging his companion after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the fort! to the fort.\xe2\x80\x9d he cried at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ice may have\r\nopened, we may be able to launch our boat on the sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the two ran as fast as ever they could towards Fort Hope by the\r\nshortest way.\r\n\r\nA thousand conjectures crowded upon them. From what new phenomenon did\r\nthe unexpected noise proceed? Did the sleeping inhabitants of the fort\r\nknow what was going on? They must certainly have heard the noise, for,\r\nin vulgar language, it was loud enough to wake the dead.\r\n\r\nHobson and Long crossed the two miles between them and Fort Hope in\r\ntwenty minutes, but before they reached the enceinte they saw the men\r\nand women they had left asleep hurrying away in terrified disorder,\r\nuttering cries of despair.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter Mac-Nab, seeing the Lieutenant, ran towards him with his\r\nlittle boy in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, sir, look!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, drawing his master towards a little\r\nhill which rose a few yards behind the fort.\r\n\r\nHobson obeyed, and saw that part of the ice-wall, which, when he left,\r\nwas two or three miles off in the offing, had fallen upon the coast of\r\nthe island. Cape Bathurst no longer existed, the mass of earth and\r\nsand of which it was composed had been swept away by the icebergs and\r\nscattered over the palisades. The principal house and all the buildings\r\nconnected with it on the north were buried beneath the avalanche. Masses\r\nof ice were crowding upon each other and tumbling over with an awful\r\ncrash, crushing everything beneath them. It was like an army of icebergs\r\ntaking possession of the island.\r\n\r\nThe boat which had been built at the foot of the cape was completely\r\ndestroyed. The last hope of the unfortunate colonists was gone!\r\n\r\nAs they stood watching the awful scene, the buildings, formerly occupied\r\nby the soldiers and women, and from which they had escaped in time,\r\ngave way beneath an immense block of ice which fell upon them. A cry of\r\ndespair burst from the lips of the houseless outcasts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the others, where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Lieutenant in\r\nheart-rending tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mac-Nab, pointing to the heap of sand, earth, and\r\nice, beneath which the principal house had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nYes, the illustrious lady traveller, Madge, Kalumah, and Thomas Black,\r\nwere buried beneath the avalanche which had surprised them in their\r\nsleep!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. ALL AT WORK. Fearful catastrophe had occurred. The\r\nice-wall had been flung upon the wandering island, the volume below the\r\nwater being five times that of the projecting part, it had come under\r\nthe influence of the submarine currents, and, opening a way for itself\r\nbetween the broken ice-masses, it had fallen bodily upon Victoria\r\nIsland, which, driven along by this mighty propelling force, was\r\ndrifting rapidly to the south.\r\n\r\nMac-Nab and his companions, aroused by the noise of the avalanche\r\ndashing down upon the dog-house, stable, and principal house, had been\r\nable to escape in time, but now the work of destruction was complete.\r\nNot a trace remained of the buildings in which they had slept, and\r\nthe island was bearing all its inhabitants with it to the unfathomable\r\ndepths of the ocean! Perhaps, however, Mrs Barnett, Madge, Kalumah, and\r\nthe astronomer, were still living! Dead or alive they must be dug out.\r\n\r\nAt this thought Hobson recovered his composure and shouted\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet shovels and pickaxes! The house is strong! it may have held\r\ntogether! Let us set to work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of tools and pickaxes, but it was really impossible\r\nto approach the enceinte. The masses of ice were rolling down from the\r\nsummits of the icebergs, and some parts of the ice-wall still towered\r\namongst the ruins two hundred feet above the island. The force with\r\nwhich the tossing masses, which seemed to be surging all along the\r\nnorthern horizon, were overthrown can be imagined; the whole coast\r\nbetween the former Cape Bathurst and Cape Esquimaux was not only hemmed\r\nin, but literally invaded by these moving mountains, which, impelled by\r\na force they could not resist, had already advanced more than a quarter\r\nof a mile inland.\r\n\r\nEvery moment the trembling of the ground and a loud report gave notice\r\nthat another of these masses had rolled over, and there was a danger\r\nthat the island would sink beneath the weight thrown upon it. A very\r\napparent lowering of the level had taken place all along that part of\r\nthe coast near Cape Bathurst, it was evidently gradually sinking down,\r\nand the sea had already encroached nearly as far as the lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the colonists was truly terrible, unable as they were\r\nto attempt to save their companions, and driven from the enceinte by the\r\ncrashing avalanches, over which they had no power whatever. They could\r\nonly wait, a prey to the most awful forebodings.\r\n\r\nDay dawned at last, and how fearful a scene was presented by the\r\ndistricts around Cape Bathurst! The horizon was shut in on every side by\r\nice-masses, but their advance appeared to be checked for the moment at\r\nleast. The ruins of the ice-wall were at rest, and it was only now and\r\nthen that a few blocks rolled down from the still tottering crests of\r\nthe remaining icebergs. But the whole mass\xe2\x80\x94a great part of its volume\r\nbeing sunk beneath the surface of the sea\xe2\x80\x94was in the grasp of a\r\npowerful current, and was driving the island along with it to the south,\r\nthat is to say, to the ocean, in the depths of which they would alike be\r\nengulfed.\r\n\r\nThose who were thus borne along upon the island were not fully conscious\r\nof the peril in which they stood. They had their comrades to save, and\r\namongst them the brave woman who had so won all their hearts, and for\r\nwhom they would gladly have laid down their lives. The time for action\r\nhad come, they could again approach the palisades, and there was not a\r\nmoment to lose, as the poor creatures had already been buried beneath\r\nthe avalanche for six hours.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that Cape Bathurst no longer existed. Struck by a\r\nhuge iceberg it had fallen bodily upon the factory, breaking the boat\r\nand crushing the dog-house and stable with the poor creatures in them.\r\nThe principal house next disappeared beneath the masses of earth and\r\nsand, upon which rolled blocks of ice to a height of fifty or sixty\r\nfeet. The court of the fort was filled up, of the palisade not a post\r\nwas to be seen, and it was from beneath this accumulation of earth,\r\nsand, and ice, that the victims were to be dug out.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning to work Hobson called the head carpenter to him, and\r\nasked if he thought the house could bear the weight of the avalanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mac-Nab; \xe2\x80\x9cin fact, I may almost say\r\nI am sure of it. You remember how we strengthened it, it has been\r\n\xe2\x80\x98casemated,\xe2\x80\x99 and the vertical beams between the ceilings and floors\r\nmust have offered great resistance; moreover, the layer of earth and\r\nsand with which the roof was first covered must have broken the shock of\r\nthe fall of the blocks of ice from the icebergs.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGod grant you may\r\nbe right, Mac-Nab,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cand that we may be spared the\r\ngreat grief of losing our friends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant then sent for Mrs Joliffe, and asked her if plenty of\r\nprovisions had been left in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Joliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was plenty to eat in the\r\npantry and kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd any water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, water and rum too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will not be starved\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nhow about air?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this question Mac-Nab could make no reply, and if, as he hoped, the\r\nhouse had not given way, the want of air would be the chief danger of\r\nthe four victims. By prompt measures, however, they might yet be saved,\r\nand the first thing to be done was to open a communication with the\r\nouter air.\r\n\r\nAll set to work zealously, men and women alike seizing shovels and\r\npickaxes. The masses of ice, sand, and earth, were vigorously attacked\r\nat the risk of provoking fresh downfalls; but the proceedings were ably\r\ndirected by Mac-Nab.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to him best to begin at the top of the accumulated masses,\r\nso as to roll down loose blocks on the side of the lagoon. The smaller\r\npieces were easily dealt with, with pick and crowbar, but the large\r\nblocks had to be broken up. Some of great size were melted with the aid\r\nof a large fire of resinous wood, and every means was tried to destroy\r\nor get rid of the ice in the shortest possible time.\r\n\r\nBut so great was the accumulation, that although all worked without\r\npause, except when they snatched a little food, there was no sensible\r\ndiminution in its amount when the sun disappeared below the horizon. It\r\nwas not, however, really of quite so great a height as before, and it\r\nwas determined to go on working from above through the night, and when\r\nthere was no longer any danger of fresh falls Mac-Nab hoped to be able\r\nto sink a vertical shaft in the compact mass, so as to admit the outer\r\nair to the house as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAll night long the party worked at the excavation, attacking the masses\r\nwith iron and heat, as the one or the other seemed more likely to be\r\neffective. The men wielded the pickaxe whilst the women kept up the\r\nfires; but all were animated by one purpose\xe2\x80\x94the saving of the lives of\r\nMrs Barnett, Madge, Kalumah, and the astronomer.\r\n\r\nWhen morning dawned the poor creatures had been buried for thirty hours\r\nin air necessarily very impure under so thick a cover.\r\n\r\nThe progress made in the night had been so great that Mac-Nab prepared\r\nto sink his shaft, which he meant to go straight down to the top of the\r\nhouse; and which, according to his calculation, would not have to be\r\nmore than fifty feet deep. It would be easy enough to sink this\r\nshaft through the twenty feet of ice; but great difficulty would\r\nbe experienced when the earth and sand were reached, as, being very\r\nbrittle, they would of course constantly fill in the shaft, and its\r\nsides would therefore have to be lined. Long pieces of wood were\r\nprepared for this purpose, and the boring proceeded. Only three\r\nmen could work at it together, and the soldiers relieved each other\r\nconstantly, so that the excavation seemed likely to proceed rapidly.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed the poor fellows alternated between hope and fear\r\nwhen some obstacle delayed them. When a sudden fall undid their work\r\nthey felt discouraged, and nothing but Mac-Nab\xe2\x80\x99s steady voice could\r\nhave rallied them. As the men toiled in turn at their weary task the\r\nwomen stood watching them from the foot of a hill, saying little, but\r\noften praying silently. They had now nothing to do but to prepare the\r\nfood, which the men devoured in their short intervals of repose.\r\n\r\nThe boring proceeded without any very great difficulty, but the ice was\r\nso hard that the progress was but slow. At the end of the second day\r\nMac-Nab had nearly reached the layer of earth and sand, and could not\r\nhope to get to the top of the house before the end of the next day.\r\n\r\nNight fell, but the work was continued by the light of torches. A\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csnow-house\xe2\x80\x9d was hastily dug out in one of the hummocks on the shore\r\nas a temporary shelter for the women and the little boy. The wind had\r\nveered to the south-west, and a cold rain began to fall, accompanied\r\nwith occasional squalls; but neither the Lieutenant nor his men dreamt\r\nof leaving off work.\r\n\r\nNow began the worst part of the task. It was really impossible to bore\r\nin the shifting masses of sand and earth, and it became necessary to\r\nprop up the sides of the shaft with wood, the loose earth being drawn\r\nto the surface in a bucket hung on a rope. Of course under the\r\ncircumstances the work could not proceed rapidly, falls might occur at\r\nany moment, and the miners were in danger of being buried in their turn.\r\n\r\nMac-Nab was generally the one to remain at the bottom of the narrow\r\nshaft, directing the excavation, and frequently sounding with a long\r\npick, but as it met with no resistance, it was evident that it did not\r\nreach the roof of the house.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning once more dawned, only ten feet had been excavated in\r\nthe mass of earth and sand, so that twenty remained to be bored through\r\nbefore the roof of the house could be reached, that is to say, if it had\r\nnot given way, and still occupied the position it did before the fall of\r\nthe avalanche.\r\n\r\nIt was now fifty-four hours since Mrs Barnett and her companions were\r\nburied!\r\n\r\nMac-Nab and the Lieutenant often wondered if they on their side had made\r\nany effort to open a communication with the outer air. They felt sure\r\nthat with her usual courage, Mrs Barnett would have tried to find some\r\nway out if her movements were free. Some tools had been left in the\r\nhouse, and Kellet, one of the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s men, remembered leaving his\r\npickaxe in the kitchen. The prisoners might have broken open one of the\r\ndoors and begun to pierce a gallery across the layer of earth. But such\r\na gallery could only be driven in a horizontal direction, and would be\r\na much longer business than the sinking of a shaft from above, for\r\nthe masses flung down by the avalanche, although only sixty feet deep,\r\ncovered a space more than five hundred feet in diameter. Of course the\r\nprisoners could not be aware of this fact, and if they should succeed in\r\nboring their horizontal gallery, it would be eight days at least before\r\nthey could cut through the last layer of ice, and by that time they\r\nwould be totally deprived of air, if not of food.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the Lieutenant carefully went over every portion of\r\nthe accumulation himself, and listened intently for any sounds of\r\nsubterranean digging, but he heard nothing.\r\n\r\nOn the return of day the men toiled with fresh energy, bucket after\r\nbucket was drawn to the surface of the shaft loaded with earth. The\r\nclumsy wooden props answered admirably in keeping the earth from filling\r\nin the pit, a few falls occurred, but they were rapidly checked, and no\r\nfresh misfortunes occurred throughout the day, except that the soldier\r\nGarry received a blow on the head from a falling block of ice. The wound\r\nwas not however severe, and he would not leave his work.\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the shaft was fifty feet deep altogether, having been\r\nsunk through twenty feet of ice and thirty of sand and earth.\r\n\r\nIt was at this depth that Mac-Nab had expected to reach the roof of the\r\nhouse, if it had resisted the pressure of the avalanche.\r\n\r\nHe was then at the bottom of the shaft, and his disappointment and\r\ndismay can be imagined when, on driving his pickaxe into the ground as\r\nfar as it would go, it met with no resistance whatever.\r\n\r\nSabine was with him, and for a few moments he remained with his arms\r\ncrossed, silently looking at his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo roof then?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the hunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the carpenter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut let us work on,\r\nthe roof has bent of course, but the floor of the loft cannot have given\r\nway. Another ten feet and we shall come to that floor, or else\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMac-Nab did not finish his sentence, and the two resumed their work with\r\nthe strength of despair.\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, another ten or twelve feet had been dug\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMac-Nab sounded again, nothing yet, his pick still sunk in the shifting\r\nearth, and flinging it from him, he buried his face in his hands and\r\nmuttered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor things, poor things!\xe2\x80\x9d He then climbed to the opening of the\r\nshaft by means of the wood-work.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant and the Sergeant were together in greater anxiety than\r\never, and taking them aside, the carpenter told them of his dreadful\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cthe house must have been crushed by the\r\navalanche, and the poor people in it\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the head-carpenter with earnest conviction, \xe2\x80\x9cno, it\r\ncannot have been crushed, it must have resisted, strengthened as it was.\r\nIt cannot\xe2\x80\x94it cannot have been crushed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant in a broken\r\nvoice, his eyes filling with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply this,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mac-Nab, \xe2\x80\x9cthe house itself has remained\r\nintact, but the ground on which it was built must have sunk. The house\r\nhas gone through the crust of ice which forms the foundation of the\r\nisland. It has not been crushed, but engulfed, and the poor creatures in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre drowned!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sergeant, drowned without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice\xe2\x80\x94drowned like\r\npassengers on a foundered vessel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some minutes the three men remained silent. Mac-Nab\xe2\x80\x99s idea was\r\nprobably correct. Nothing was more likely than that the ice forming the\r\nfoundation of the island had given way under such enormous pressure. The\r\nvertical props which supported the beams of the ceiling, and rested on\r\nthose of the floor, had evidently aided the catastrophe by their weight,\r\nand the whole house had been engulfed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mac-Nab,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hobson at last, \xe2\x80\x9cif we cannot find them\r\nalive\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must recover their bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d added the head carpenter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with these words Mac-Nab, accompanied by the Lieutenant, went\r\nback to his work at the bottom of the shaft without a word to any of his\r\ncomrades of the terrible form his anxiety had now assumed.\r\n\r\nThe excavation continued throughout the night, the men relieving each\r\nother every hour, and Hobson and Mac-Nab watched them at work without a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s rest.\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning Kellet\xe2\x80\x99s pickaxe struck against\r\nsomething hard, which gave out a ringing sound. The head carpenter felt\r\nit almost before he heard it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have reached them!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the soldier, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, and go on working,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Lieutenant in a\r\nchoked voice.\r\n\r\nIt was now seventy-six hours since the avalanche fell upon the house!\r\n\r\nKellet and his companion Pond resumed their work. The shaft must have\r\nnearly reached the level of the sea, and Mac-Nab therefore felt that all\r\nhope was gone.\r\n\r\nIn less than twenty minutes the hard body which Kellet had struck\r\nwas uncovered, and proved to be one of the rafters of the roof. The\r\ncarpenter flung himself to the bottom of the shaft, and seizing a\r\npickaxe sent the laths of the roof flying on every side. In a few\r\nmoments a large aperture was made, and a figure appeared at it which it\r\nwas difficult to recognise in the darkness.\r\n\r\nIt was Kalumah!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp! help!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured feebly.\r\n\r\nHobson let himself down through the opening, and found himself up to the\r\nwaist in ice-cold water. Strange to say, the roof had not given way, but\r\nas Mac-Nab had supposed, the house had sunk, and was full of water. The\r\nwater did not, however, yet fill the loft, and was not more than a foot\r\nabove the floor. There was still a faint hope!\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant, feeling his way in the darkness, came across a\r\nmotionless body, and dragging it to the opening he consigned it to Pond\r\nand Kellet. It was Thomas Black.\r\n\r\nMadge, also senseless, was next found; and she and the astronomer were\r\ndrawn up to the surface of the ground with ropes, where the open air\r\ngradually restored them to consciousness.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett was still missing, but Kalumah led Hobson to the very end of\r\nthe loft, and there he found the unhappy lady motionless and insensible,\r\nwith her head scarcely out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant lifted her in his arms and carried her to the opening,\r\nand a few moments later he had reached the outer air with his burden,\r\nfollowed by Mac-Nab with Kalumah.\r\n\r\nEvery one gathered round Mrs Barnett in silent anxiety, and poor\r\nKalumah, exhausted as she was, flung herself across her friend\xe2\x80\x99s body.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett still breathed, her heart still beat feebly, and revived by\r\nthe pure fresh air she at last opened her eyes.\r\n\r\nA cry of joy burst from every lip, a cry of gratitude to Heaven for the\r\ngreat mercy vouchsafed, which was doubtless heard above.\r\n\r\nDay was now breaking in the east, the sun was rising above the horizon,\r\nlighting up the ocean with its brilliant beams, and Mrs Barnett\r\npainfully staggered to her feet. Looking round her from the summit of\r\nthe new mountain formed by the avalanche, which overlooked the whole\r\nisland, she murmured in a changed and hollow voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sea! the sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, the ocean now encircled the wandering island, the sea was open at\r\nlast, and a true sea-horizon shut in the view from east to west.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. BEHRING SEA. The island, driven by the ice-wall, had then\r\ndrifted at a great speed into Behring Sea, after crossing the strait\r\nwithout running aground on its shores! It was still hurrying on before\r\nthe icy barrier, which was in the grasp of a powerful submarine current,\r\nhastening onwards on to its inevitable dissolution in the warmer waters\r\nof the Pacific, and the boat on which all had depended was useless!\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mrs Barnett had entirely recovered consciousness, she related\r\nin a few words the history of the seventy-four hours spent in the house\r\nnow in the water. Thomas Black, Madge, and Kalumah had been aroused\r\nby the crash of the avalanche, and had rushed to the doors or windows.\r\nThere was no longer any possibility of getting out, the mass of earth\r\nand sand, which was but a moment before Cape Bathurst, completely\r\ncovered the house, and almost immediately afterwards the prisoners heard\r\nthe crash of the huge ice-masses which were flung upon the factory.\r\n\r\nIn another quarter of an hour all felt that the house, whilst resisting\r\nthe enormous pressure, was sinking through the soil of the island. They\r\nknew that the crust of the ice must have given way, and that the house\r\nwould fill with water!\r\n\r\nTo seize a few provisions remaining in the pantry, and to take refuge in\r\nthe loft, was the work of a moment. This the poor creatures did from a\r\ndim instinct of self-preservation, but what hope could they really\r\nhave of being saved! However, the loft seemed likely to resist, and two\r\nblocks of ice abutting from the roof saved it from being immediately\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus imprisoned the poor creatures could hear the constant falls\r\nfrom the icebergs, whilst the sea was gradually rising through the lower\r\nrooms. They must either be crushed or drowned!\r\n\r\nBut by little short of a miracle, the roof of the house, with its strong\r\nframework, resisted the pressure, and after sinking a certain depth the\r\nhouse remained stationary, with the water rather above the floor of the\r\nloft. The prisoners were obliged to take refuge amongst the rafters\r\nof the roof, and there they remained for many hours. Kalumah devoted\r\nherself to the service of the others, and carried food to them through\r\nthe water. They could make no attempt to save themselves, succour could\r\nonly come from without.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible situation, for breathing was difficult in the vitiated\r\nair deficient as it was in oxygen, and charged with a great excess of\r\ncarbonic acid.... A few hours later Hobson would only have found the\r\ncorpses of his friends!\r\n\r\nThe horror of the position was increased by the gushing of the water\r\nthrough the lower rooms, which convinced Mrs Barnett that the island was\r\ndrifting to the south. She had, in fact, guessed the whole truth; she\r\nknew that the ice-wall had heeled over and fallen upon the island, and\r\nconcluded that the boat was destroyed. It was this last fact which gave\r\nsuch terrible significance to her first words when she looked around her\r\nafter her swoon\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sea! the sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose about her, however, could think of nothing yet but the fact, that\r\nthey had saved her for whom they would have died, and with her Madge,\r\nKalumah, and Thomas Black. Thus far not one of those who had joined\r\nthe Lieutenant in his disastrous expedition had succumbed to any of the\r\nfearful dangers through which they had passed.\r\n\r\nBut matters were not yet at their worst, and fresh troubles were soon to\r\nhasten the final catastrophe.\r\n\r\nHobson\xe2\x80\x99s first care after Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s recovery was to take the\r\nbearings of the inland. It was listless now to think of quitting it, as\r\nthe sea was open and their boat destroyed. A few ruins alone remained\r\nof the mighty ice-wall, the upper portion of which had crushed Cape\r\nBathurst whilst the submerged base was driving the island to the south.\r\n\r\nThe instruments and maps belonging to the astronomer were found in the\r\nruins of the house, and were fortunately uninjured. The weather was\r\ncloudy, but Hobson succeeded in taking the altitude of the sun with\r\nsufficient accuracy for his purpose.\r\n\r\nWe give the result obtained at noon on the 12th May. Victoria Island was\r\nthen situated in longitude 168\xc2\xb012\xe2\x80\x99 west of Greenwich, and in latitude\r\n63\xc2\xb037\xe2\x80\x99 N. The exact spot was looked out on the chart, and proved\r\nto be in Norton Sound, between Cape Tchaplin on the Asiatic and Cape\r\nStephens on the American coast, but a hundred miles from either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must give up all hope of making the land of the continent then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hobson; \xe2\x80\x9call hope of that is at an end; the\r\ncurrent is carrying us with great rapidity out into the offing, and our\r\nonly chance is, that we may pass within sight of a whaler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cif we cannot make the land\r\nof either continent, might not the current drive us on to one of the\r\nislands of Behring Sea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was, in fact, a slight possibility that such a thing might happen,\r\nand all eagerly clutched at the hope, like a drowning man at a plank.\r\nThere are plenty of islands in Behring Sea, St Lawrence, St Matthew,\r\nNunivak, St Paul, George island, &c. The wandering island was in fact at\r\nthat moment not far from St Lawrence, which is of a considerable size,\r\nand surrounded with islets; and should it pass it without stopping,\r\nthere was yet a hope that the cluster of the Aleutian Islands, bounding\r\nBehring Sea on the south, might arrest its course.\r\n\r\nYes! St Lawrence might be a harbour of refuge for the colonists, and if\r\nit failed them, St Matthew, and the group of islets of which it is the\r\ncentre, would still be left. It would not do, however, to count upon\r\nthe Aleutian Islands, which were more than eight hundred miles away,\r\nand which they might never reach. Long, long before they got so far,\r\nVictoria Island, worn away by the warm sea-waves, and melted by the rays\r\nof the sun, which was already in the sign of Gemini, would most likely\r\nhave sunk to the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no fixed point beyond which floating ice does not\r\nadvance. It approaches nearer to the equator in the southern than in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. Icebergs have been seen off the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nat about thirty-six degrees south latitude, but those which come down\r\nfrom the Arctic Ocean have never passed forty degrees north latitude.\r\nThe weather conditions, which are of course variable, determine the\r\nexact locality where ice will melt; in severe and prolonged winters it\r\nremains solid in comparatively low latitudes, and vice versa in early\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nNow the warm season of 1861 had set in very early, and this would\r\nhasten the dissolution of Victoria Island. The waters of Behring Sea\r\nhad already changed from blue to green, as the great navigator\r\nHudson observed they always do on the approach of icebergs, so that a\r\ncatastrophe might be expected at any moment.\r\n\r\nHobson determined to do his best to avert the coming misfortune, and\r\nordered a raft to be constructed which would carry the whole colony,\r\nand might be guided to the continent somehow or other. There was every\r\nchance of meeting vessels now that the whaling season had commenced, and\r\nMac-Nab was commissioned to make a large solid raft which would float\r\nwhen Victoria Island was engulfed.\r\n\r\nBut first of all, it was necessary to construct some shelter for the\r\nhomeless inhabitants of the island. The simple plan appeared to be\r\nto dig out the old barracks, which had been built on to the principal\r\nhouse, and the walls of which were still standing. Every one set to work\r\nwith a hearty good-will, and in a few days a shelter was provided from\r\nthe inclemencies of the fickle weather.\r\n\r\nSearch was also made in the ruins of the large house, and a good\r\nmany articles of more or less value were saved from the submerged\r\nrooms\xe2\x80\x94tools, arms, furniture, the air pumps, and the air vessel, &c.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th May all hope of drifting on to the island of St Lawrence had\r\nto be abandoned. When the bearings were taken, it was found that they\r\nwere passing at a considerable distance to the east of that island; and,\r\nas Hobson was well aware, currents do not run against natural obstacles,\r\nbut turn them, so that little hope could be entertained of thus\r\nmaking the land. It is true the network of islands in the Catherine\r\nArchipelago, scattered over several degrees of latitude, might stop the\r\nisland if it ever got so far. But, as we have before stated, that was\r\nnot probable, although it was advancing at great speed; for this speed\r\nmust decrease considerably when the ice-wall which was driving it along\r\nshould be broken away or dissolved, unprotected as it was from the heat\r\nof the sun by any covering of earth or sand.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson, Mrs Barnett, Sergeant Long, and the head carpenter\r\noften discussed these matters, and came to the conclusion that the\r\nisland could certainly never reach the Aleutian group with so many\r\nchances against it.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th May, Mac-Nab and his men commenced the construction of a\r\nhuge raft. It had to be as high as possible above the water, to prevent\r\nthe waves from breaking over it, so that it was really a formidable\r\nundertaking. The blacksmith, Rae, had fortunately found a large number\r\nof the iron bolts which had been brought from Fort Reliance, and they\r\nwere invaluable for firmly fastening together the different portions of\r\nthe framework of the raft.\r\n\r\nWe must describe the novel site for the building of the raft suggested\r\nby Lieutenant Hobson. Instead of joining the timbers and planks\r\ntogether on the ground, they were joined on the surface of the lake.\r\nThe different pieces of wood were prepared on the banks, and launched\r\nseparately. They were then easily fitted together on the water. This\r\nmode of proceeding had two advantages:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n1. The carpenter would be able at once to judge of the point of\r\nflotation, and the stability which should be given to the raft. 2. When\r\nVictoria Island melted, the raft would already be floating, and would\r\nnot be liable to the shocks it would receive if on land when the\r\ninevitable break-up came.\r\n\r\nWhilst these works were going on, Hobson would wander about on the\r\nbeach, either alone or with Mrs Barnett, examining the state of the sea,\r\nand the ever-changing windings of the coast-line, worn by the constant\r\naction of the waves. He would gaze upon the vast deserted ocean, from\r\nwhich the very icebergs had now disappeared, watching, ever watching,\r\nlike a shipwrecked mariner, for the vessel which never came. The ocean\r\nsolitudes were only frequented by cetacea, which came to feed upon the\r\nmicroscopic anima[l]culae which form their principal food, and abound in\r\nthe green waters. Now and then floating trees of different kinds, which\r\nhad been brought by the great ocean currents from warm latitudes, passed\r\nthe island on their way to the north.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th May, Mrs Barnett and Madge were walking together on that\r\npart of the island between the former Cape Bathurst and Port Barnett. It\r\nwas a fine warm day, and there had been no traces of snow on the ground\r\nfor some time; all that recalled the bitter cold of the Polar regions\r\nwere the relics left by the ice-wall on the northern part of the island;\r\nbut even these were rapidly melting, and every day fresh waterfalls\r\npoured from their summits and bathed their sides. Very soon the sun\r\nwould have completely dissolved every atom of ice.\r\n\r\nStrange indeed was the aspect of Victoria Island. But for their terrible\r\nanxiety, the colonists must have gazed at it with eager interest. The\r\nground was more prolific than it could have been in any former spring,\r\ntransferred as it was to milder latitudes. The little mosses and\r\ntender flowers grew rapidly, and Mrs Joliffe\xe2\x80\x99s garden was wonderfully\r\nsuccessful. The vegetation of every kind, hitherto checked by the rigour\r\nof the Arctic winter, was not only more abundant, but more brilliantly\r\ncoloured. The hues of leaves and flowers were no longer pale and watery,\r\nbut warm and glowing, like the sunbeams which called them forth. The\r\narbutus, willow, birch, fir, and pine trees were clothed with\r\ndark verdure; the sap\xe2\x80\x94sometimes heated in a temperature of 68\xc2\xb0\r\nFahrenheit\xe2\x80\x94burst open the young buds; in a word, the Arctic landscape\r\nwas completely transformed, for the island was now beneath the same\r\nparallel of latitude as Christiania or Stockholm, that is to say, in one\r\nof the finest districts of the temperate zones.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs Barnett had now no eyes for these wonderful phenomena of nature.\r\nThe shadow of the coming doom clouded her spirit. She shared the feeling\r\nof depression manifested by the hundreds of animals now collected round\r\nthe factory. The foxes, martens, ermines, lynxes, beavers, musk-rats,\r\ngluttons, and even the wolves, rendered less savage by their instinctive\r\nknowledge of a common danger, approached nearer and nearer to their\r\nold enemy man, as if man could save them. It was a tacit, a touching\r\nacknowledgment of human superiority, under circumstances in which that\r\nsuperiority could be of absolutely no avail.\r\n\r\nNo! Mrs Barnett cared no longer for the beauties of nature, and gazed\r\nwithout ceasing upon the boundless, pitiless, infinite ocean with its\r\nunbroken horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Madge!\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last to her faithful companion; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwas I who brought you to this terrible pass\xe2\x80\x94you who have followed me\r\neverywhere, and whose fidelity deserved a far different recompense! Can\r\nyou forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is but one thing I could never have forgiven you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMadge,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9da death I did not share!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Madge!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cif my death could save the lives\r\nof all these poor people, how gladly would I die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge, \xe2\x80\x9chave you lost all hope at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs Barnett, hiding her face on Madge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe strong masculine nature had given way at last, and Mrs Barnett was\r\nfor a moment a feeble woman. Was not her emotion excusable in so awful a\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett sobbed aloud, and large tears rolled down her cheeks.\r\n\r\nMadge kissed and caressed her, and tried all she could to reassure her;\r\nand presently, raising her head, her poor mistress said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not tell them, Madge, how I have given way\xe2\x80\x94do not betray that I\r\nhave wept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, \xe2\x80\x9cand they would not believe me if I\r\ndid. It was but a moment\xe2\x80\x99s weakness. Be yourself, dear girl; cheer up,\r\nand take fresh courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you still hope yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Barnett,\r\nlooking anxiously into her companion\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still hope!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge simply.\r\n\r\nBut a few days afterwards, every chance of safety seemed to be indeed\r\ngone, when the wandering island passed outside the St Matthew group, and\r\ndrifted away from the last land in Behring Sea!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. IN THE OFFING. Victoria Island was now floating in the\r\nwidest part of Behring Sea, six hundred miles from the nearest of the\r\nAleutian Islands, and two hundred miles from the nearest land, which was\r\non the east. Supposing no accident happened, it would be three weeks at\r\nleast before this southern boundary of Behring Sea could be reached.\r\n\r\nCould the island last so long? Might it not burst open at any moment,\r\nsubject as it was even now to the constant action of tepid water, the\r\nmean temperature of which was more than 50\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit?\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson pressed on the construction of the raft as rapidly as\r\npossible, and the lower framework was already floating on the lagoon.\r\nMac-Nab wished to make it as strong as possible, for it would have a\r\nconsiderable distance to go to reach the Aleutian Islands, unless they\r\nwere fortunate enough to meet with a whaler.\r\n\r\nNo important alteration had lately taken place in the general\r\nconfiguration of the island. Reconaissances were taken everyday, but\r\ngreat caution was necessary, as a fracture of the ground might at any\r\nmoment cut off the explorers from the rest of the party.\r\n\r\nThe wide gulf near Cape Michael, which the winter had closed, had\r\nreopened gradually, and now ran a mile inland, as far as the dried-up\r\nbed of the little river. It was probable that it was soon to extend to\r\nthe bed itself, which was of course of little thickness, having been\r\nhollowed out by the stream. Should it do so, the whole district between\r\nCape Michael and Port Barnett, bounded on the west by the river bed,\r\nwould disappear\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, the colonists would lose a good many\r\nsquare miles of their domain. On this account Hobson warned every one\r\nnot to wander far, as a rough sea would be enough to bring about the\r\ndreaded catastrophe.\r\n\r\nSoundings were, however, taken, in several places with a view to\r\nascertaining where the ice was thickest, and it was found that, near\r\nCape Bathurst, not only was the layer of earth and sand of greater\r\nextent\xe2\x80\x94which was of little importance\xe2\x80\x94but the crust of ice was\r\nthicker than anywhere else. This was a most fortunate circumstance,\r\nand the holes made in sounding were kept open, so that the amount of\r\ndiminution in the base of the island could be estimated every day. This\r\ndiminution was slow but sure, and, making allowance for the unfortunate\r\nfact that the island was drifting into warmer waters, it was decided\r\nthat it was impossible for it to last another three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe next week, from the 19th to the 25th May, the weather was very bad.\r\nA fearful storm broke over the island, accompanied by flash after\r\nflash of lightning and peals of thunder. The sea rose high, lashed by\r\na powerful north-west wind, and its waves broke over the doomed island,\r\nmaking it tremble ominously. The little colony were on the watch, ready\r\non an emergency to embark in the raft, the scaffolding of which was\r\nnearly finished, and some provisions and fresh water were taken on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nRain heavy enough to penetrate to the ice-crust fell in large quantities\r\nduring this storm, and melted it in many places. On the slopes of some\r\nof the hills the earth was washed away, leaving the white foundations\r\nbare. These ravines were hastily filled up with soil to protect the ice\r\nfrom the action of the warm air and rain, and but for this precaution\r\nthe soil would have been everywhere perforated.\r\n\r\nGreat havoc was caused amongst the woods by this storm; the earth and\r\nsand were washed away from the roots of the trees, which fell in large\r\nnumbers. In a single night the aspect of the country between the lake\r\nand the former Port Barnett was completely changed. A few groups of\r\nbirch trees and thickets of firs alone remained\xe2\x80\x94a fact significant of\r\napproaching decomposition, which no human skill could prevent! Every one\r\nknew and felt that the ephemeral inland was gradually succumbing\xe2\x80\x94every\r\none, except perhaps Thomas Black, who was still gloomily indifferent to\r\nall that was going on.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of May, during the storm, the hunter Sabine left the house in\r\nthe thick fog, and was nearly drowned in a large hole which had opened\r\nduring the night on the site formerly occupied by the principal house of\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\nHitherto, as we are aware, the house, three quarters submerged, and\r\nburied beneath a mass of earth and sand, had remained fixed in the\r\nice-crust beneath the island; but now the sea had evidently enlarged the\r\ncrevasse, and the house with all it contained had sunk to rise no more.\r\nEarth and sand were pouring through this fissure, at the bottom of which\r\nsurged the tempest-tossed waves\r\n\r\nSabine\xe2\x80\x99s comrades, hearing his cries, rushed to his assistance, and\r\nwere just in time to save him as he was still clinging to the slippery\r\nwalls of the abyss. He escaped with a ducking which might have had\r\ntragic consequences.\r\n\r\nA little later the beams and planks of the house, which had slid under\r\nthe island, were seen floating about in the offing like the spars of a\r\nwrecked vessel. This was the worst evil the storm had wrought, and would\r\ncompromise the solidity of the island yet more, as the waves would now\r\neat away the ice all round the crevasse.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the 25th May, the wind veered to the north-east,\r\nand although it blew strongly, it was no longer a hurricane; the rain\r\nceased, and the sea became calmer. After a quiet night the sun rose\r\nupon the desolate scene, the Lieutenant was able to take the bearings\r\naccurately, and obtained the following result:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAt noon on the 25th May, Victoria Island was in latitude 56\xc2\xb0 13\xe2\x80\x99, and\r\nlongitude 170\xc2\xb0 23\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nIt had therefore advanced at great speed, having drifted nearly eight\r\nhundred miles since the breaking up of the ice set it free in Behring\r\nStrait two months before.\r\n\r\nThis great speed made the Lieutenant once more entertain a slight hope.\r\nHe pointed out the Aleutian Islands on the map to his comrades, and\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at these islands; they are not now two hundred miles from us,\r\nand we may reach them in eight days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight days!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Long, shaking his head; \xe2\x80\x9ceight days is a\r\nlong time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must add,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if our island had followed\r\nthe hundred and sixty-eighth meridian, it would already have reached\r\nthe parallel of these islands, but in consequence of a deviation of the\r\nBehring current, it is bearing in a south-westerly direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant was right, the current seemed likely to drag the island\r\naway from all land, even out of sight of the Aleutian Islands, which\r\nonly extend as far as the hundred and seventieth meridian.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett examined the map in silence. She saw the pencil-mark which\r\ndenoted the exact spot then occupied by the island.\r\n\r\nThe map was made on a large scale, and the point representing the island\r\nlooked but a speck upon the vast expanse of the Behring Sea. She traced\r\nback the route by which the island had come to its present position,\r\nmarvelling at the fatality, or rather the immutable law, by which the\r\ncurrents which had borne it along had avoided all land, sheering\r\nclear of islands, and never touching either continent; and she saw\r\nthe boundless Pacific Ocean, towards which she and all with her were\r\nhurrying.\r\n\r\nShe mused long upon this melancholy subject, and at last exclaimed\r\nsuddenly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould not the course of the island be controlled? Eight days at this\r\npace would bring us to the last island of the Aleutian group.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose eight days are in the hands of God,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lieutenant\r\nHobson gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cwe can exercise no control upon them. Help can only\r\ncome to us from above; there is nothing left for us to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Heaven helps those who\r\nhelp themselves. Is there really nothing we can do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson shook his head doubtfully. His only hope was in the raft, and he\r\nwas undecided whether to embark every one on it at once, contrive some\r\nsort of a sail with clothes, &c., and try to reach the nearest land, or\r\nto wait yet a little longer.\r\n\r\nHe consulted Sergeant Long, Mac-Nab, Rae, Marbre, and Sabine, in whom he\r\nhad great confidence, and all agreed that it would be unwise to abandon\r\nthe island before they were obliged. The raft, constantly swept as it\r\nwould be by the waves, could only be a last resource, and would not move\r\nat half the pace of the island, still driven towards the south by the\r\nremains of the ice-wall. The wind generally blew from the east, and\r\nwould be likely to drift the raft out into the offing away from all\r\nland. They must still wait then, always wait; for the island was\r\ndrifting rapidly towards the Aleutians. When they really approached the\r\ngroup they would be able to see what it would be best to do.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly the wisest course to take. In eight days, if the\r\npresent speed were maintained, the island would either stop at the\r\nsouthern boundary of Behring Sea, or be dragged to the south west to the\r\nwaters of the Pacific Ocean, where certain destruction awaited it.\r\n\r\nBut the adverse fate which seemed all along to have followed the hapless\r\ncolonists had yet another blow in store for them: the speed on which\r\nthey counted was now to fail them, as everything else had done.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 26th May, the orientation of the island changed\r\nonce more; and this time the results of the displacement were extremely\r\nserious. The island turned half round, and the icebergs still remaining\r\nof the huge ice-wall, which had shut in the northern horizon, were now\r\non the south.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the shipwrecked travellers\xe2\x80\x94what name could be more\r\nappropriate?\xe2\x80\x94saw the sun rise above Cape Esquimaux instead of above\r\nPort Barnett.\r\n\r\nHardly a hundred yards off rose the icebergs, rapidly melting, but still\r\nof a considerable size, which till then had driven the island before\r\nthem. The southern horizon was now partly shut in by them.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the consequences of this fresh change of position? Would\r\nnot the icebergs now float away from the island, with which they were no\r\nlonger connected?\r\n\r\nAll were oppressed with a presentiment of some new misfortune, and\r\nunderstood only too well what Kellet meant when he exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening we shall have lost our screw!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\nBy this Kellet meant that the icebergs, being before instead of behind\r\nthe island, would soon leave it, and as it was they which imparted to\r\nit its rapid motion, in consequence of their very great draught of\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x94their volume being six or seven feet below the sea level for\r\nevery one above\xe2\x80\x94they would now go on without it, impelled by the\r\nsubmarine current, whilst Victoria Island, not deep enough in the water\r\nto come under the influence of the current, would be left floating\r\nhelplessly on the waves.\r\n\r\nYes! Kellet was right; the island would then be like a vessel with\r\ndisabled masts and a broken screw.\r\n\r\nNo one answered the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s remark, and a quarter of an hour had\r\nnot elapsed before a loud cracking sound was heard. The summits of\r\nthe icebergs trembled, large masses broke away, and the icebergs,\r\nirresistibly drawn along by the submarine current, drifted rapidly to\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. THE ISLAND BECOMES AN ISLET. Three hours later the last\r\nrelics of the ice-wall had disappeared, proving that the island now\r\nremained stationary, and that all the force of the current was deep down\r\nbelow the waves, not on the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe bearings were taken at noon with the greatest care and twenty-four\r\nhours later it was found that Victoria Island had not advanced one mile.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining hope was that some vessel should sight the poor\r\nshipwrecked creatures, either whilst still on the island, or after they\r\nhad taken to their raft.\r\n\r\nThe island was now in 54\xc2\xb0 33\xe2\x80\x99 latitude, and 177\xc2\xb0 19\xe2\x80\x99 longitude,\r\nseveral hundred miles from the nearest land, namely, the Aleutian\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nHobson once more called his comrades together, and asked them what they\r\nthought it would be best to do.\r\n\r\nAll agreed that they should remain on the island until it broke up, as\r\nit was too large to be affected by the state of the sea, and only take\r\nto the raft when the dissolution actually commenced. Once on the frail\r\nvessel, they must wait.\r\n\r\nStill wait!\r\n\r\nThe raft was now finished. Mac-Nab had made one large shed or cabin big\r\nenough to hold every one, and to afford some little shelter from the\r\nweather. A mast had been prepared, which could be put up if necessary,\r\nand the sails intended for the boat had long been ready. The whole\r\nstructure was strong, although clumsy; and if the wind were favourable,\r\nand the sea not too rough, this rude assortment of planks and timbers\r\nmight save the lives of the whole party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Barnett,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9dnothing is impossible to Him\r\nwho rules the winds and waves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson carefully looked over the stores of provisions. The reserves had\r\nbeen much damaged by the avalanche, but there were plenty of animals\r\nstill on the island, and the abundant shrubs and mosses supplied them\r\nwith food. A few reindeer and hares were slaughtered by the hunters, and\r\ntheir flesh salted for future needs.\r\n\r\nThe health of the colonists was on the whole good. They had suffered\r\nlittle in the preceding mild winter, and all the mental trials they\r\nhad gone through had not affected their physical well-being. They were,\r\nhowever, looking forward with something of a shrinking horror to the\r\nmoment when they would have to abandon their island home, or, to speak\r\nmore correctly, when it abandoned them. It was no wonder that they did\r\nnot like the thought of floating on the ocean in a rude structure of\r\nwood subject to all the caprices of winds and waves. Even in tolerably\r\nfine weather seas would be shipped and every one constantly drenched\r\nwith saltwater. Moreover, it must be remembered that the men were none\r\nof them sailors, accustomed to navigation, and ready to risk their lives\r\non a few planks, but soldiers, trained for service on land. Their island\r\nwas fragile, it is true, and rested on a thin crust of ice; but then it\r\nwas covered with a productive soil, trees and shrubs flourished upon it,\r\nits huge bulk rendered it insensible to the motion of the waves, and\r\nit might have been supposed to be stationary. They had, in fact, become\r\nattached to Victoria Island, on which they had lived nearly two years;\r\nevery inch of the ground had become familiar to them; they had tilled\r\nthe soil, and had come safely through so many perils in their wandering\r\nhome, that in leaving it they felt as if they were parting from an old\r\nand sorely-tried friend.\r\n\r\nHobson fully sympathised with the feelings of his men, and understood\r\ntheir repugnance to embarking on the raft; but then he also knew that\r\nthe catastrophe could not now be deferred much longer, and ominous\r\nsymptoms already gave warning of its rapid approach.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe this raft. It was thirty feet square, and its deck\r\nrose two feet above the water. Its bulwarks would therefore keep out the\r\nsmall but not the large waves. In the centre the carpenter had built a\r\nregular deck-house, which would hold some twenty people. Round it were\r\nlarge lockers for the provisions and water-casks, all firmly fixed to\r\nthe deck with iron bolts. The mast, thirty feet high, was fastened to\r\nthe deck-house, and strengthened with stays attached to the corners\r\nof the raft. This mast was to have a square sail, which would only be\r\nuseful when the wind was aft. A sort of rudder was fixed to this rough\r\nstructure, the fittings of which were necessarily incomplete.\r\n\r\nSuch was the raft constructed by the head carpenter, on which twenty-one\r\npersons were to embark. It was floating peacefully on the little lake,\r\nstrongly moored to the shore.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly constructed with more care than if it had been put\r\ntogether in haste on a vessel at sea doomed to immediate destruction. It\r\nwas stronger and better fitted up; but, after all, it was but a raft.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st June a new incident occurred. Hope, one of the soldiers, went\r\nto fetch some water from the lake for culinary purposes, and when Mrs\r\nJoliffe tasted it, she found that it was salt. She called Hope, and said\r\nshe wanted fresh, not salt water.\r\n\r\nThe man replied that he had brought it from the lake as usual, and as he\r\nand Mrs Joliffe were disputing about it, the Lieutenant happened to come\r\nin. Hearing Hope\xe2\x80\x99s repeated [asertions] assertions that he had fetched\r\nthe water from the lake, he turned pale and hurried to the lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe waters were quite salt; the bottom of the lake had evidently given\r\nway, and the sea had flowed in.\r\n\r\nThe fact quickly became known, and every one was seized with a terrible\r\ndread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more fresh water!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed all the poor creatures together.\r\n\r\nLake Barnett had in fact disappeared, as Paulina River had done before.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hobson hastened to reassure his comrades about drinkable\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be plenty of ice, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can always\r\nmelt a piece of our island, and,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a ghastly attempt at\r\na smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose we shall drink it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, well known that salt separates from sea-water\r\nin freezing and evaporation. A few blocks of ice were therefore\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdisinterred,\xe2\x80\x9d if we may so express it, and melted for daily use,\r\nand to fill the casks on board the raft.\r\n\r\nIt would not do, however, to neglect this fresh warning given by nature.\r\nThe invasion of the lake by the sea proved that the base of the island\r\nwas rapidly melting. At any moment the ground might give way, and Hobson\r\nforbade his men to leave the factory, as they might be drifted away\r\nbefore they were aware of it.\r\n\r\nThe animals seemed more keenly alive than ever to approaching danger;\r\nthey gathered yet more closely round the firmer part, and after the\r\ndisappearance of the fresh water lake, they came to lick the blocks of\r\nice. They were all uneasy, and some seemed to be seized with madness,\r\nespecially the wolves, who rushed wildly towards the factory, and\r\ndashed away again howling piteously. The furred animals remained huddled\r\ntogether round the large well where the principal house had formerly\r\nstood. There were several hundreds of them, of different species,\r\nand the solitary bear roamed backwards and forwards, showing no more\r\nhostility to the quadrupeds than to men.\r\n\r\nThe number of birds, which had hitherto been considerable, now\r\ndecreased. During the last few days all those capable of long-sustained\r\nflight\xe2\x80\x94such as swans, &c, migrated towards the Aleutian Islands in the\r\nsouth, where they would find a sure refuge. This significant and ominous\r\nfact was noticed by Mrs Barnett and Madge, who were walking together on\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is plenty of food for these birds on the island,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nMrs Barnett, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet they leave it\xe2\x80\x94they have a good reason, no\r\ndoubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge; \xe2\x80\x9ctheir instinct of self-preservation makes\r\nthem take flight, and they give us a warning by which we ought to\r\nprofit. The animals also appear more uneasy than usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHobson now decided to take the greater part of the provisions and all\r\nthe camping apparatus on board the raft, and when that was done, to\r\nembark with the whole party.\r\n\r\nThe sea was, however, very rough, and the waters of the former\r\nlake\xe2\x80\x94now a kind of Mediterranean in miniature\xe2\x80\x94were greatly agitated.\r\nThe waves, confined in the narrow space, dashed mountains high, and\r\nbroke violently upon the steep banks. The raft tossed up and down, and\r\nshipped sea after sea. The embarkation of provisions, &c., had to be put\r\noff.\r\n\r\nEvery one wished to pass one more quiet night on land, and Hobson\r\nyielded against his better judgment, determined, if it were calmer the\r\nnext day, to proceed with the embarkation.\r\n\r\nThe night was more peaceful than had been expected; the wind went down,\r\nand the sea became calmer; it had but been swept by one of those sudden\r\nand brief hurricanes peculiar to these latitudes.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening the tumult ceased, and a slight\r\nsurface agitation of the waters of lake and sea alone remained.\r\n\r\nIt was some slight comfort that the island would not now be broken up\r\nsuddenly, as it must have done had the storm continued. Its dissolution\r\nwas, of course, still close at hand, but would not, it was hoped, be\r\nsudden and abrupt.\r\n\r\nThe storm was succeeded by a slight fog, which seemed likely to thicken\r\nduring the night. It came from the north, and owing to the changed\r\nposition of the island, would probably cover the greater part of it.\r\n\r\nBefore going to bed, Hobson went down and examined the moorings of the\r\nraft, which were fastened to some strong birch-trees. To make security\r\ndoubly sure, he tightened them, and the worst that could now happen\r\nwould be, that the raft would drift out on to the lagoon, which was not\r\nlarge enough to be lost upon it.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. THE FOUR FOLLOWING DAYS. The night was calm, and in the\r\nmorning the Lieutenant resolved to order the embarkation of everything\r\nand everybody that very day. He, therefore, went down to the lake to\r\nlook at the raft.\r\n\r\nThe fog was still thick, but the sunbeams were beginning to struggle\r\nthrough it. The clouds had been swept away by the hurricane of the\r\npreceding day, and it seemed likely to be hot.\r\n\r\nWhen Hobson reached the banks of the lake, the fog was still too dense\r\nfor him to make out anything on its surface, and he was waiting for it\r\nto clear away, when he was joined by Mrs Barnett, Madge, and several\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe fog gradually cleared off, drawing back to the end of the lake, but\r\nthe raft was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nPresently a gust of wind completely swept away the fog.\r\n\r\nThe raft was gone! There was no longer a lake! The boundless ocean\r\nstretched away before the astonished colonists!\r\n\r\nHobson could not check a cry of despair; and when he and his companions\r\nturned round and saw the sea on every side, they realised with a shock\r\nof horror that their island was now nothing more than an islet!\r\n\r\nDuring the night six-sevenths of the district once belonging to Cape\r\nBathurst had silently floated away, without producing a shock of any\r\nkind, so completely had the ice been worn away by the constant action\r\nof the waves, the raft had drifted out into the offing, and those whose\r\nlast hope it had been could not see a sign of it on the desolate sea.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate colonists were now overwhelmed with despair; their last\r\nhope gone, they were hanging above an awful abyss ready to swallow them\r\nup; and some of the soldiers in a fit of madness were about to throw\r\nthemselves into the sea, when Mrs Barnett flung herself before them,\r\nentreating them to desist. They yielded, some of them weeping like\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe awful situation of the colonists was indeed manifest enough, and\r\nwe may well pity the Lieutenant surrounded by the miserable despairing\r\ncreatures. Twenty-one persons on an islet of ice which must quickly melt\r\nbeneath their feet! The wooded hills had disappeared with the mass\r\nof the island now engulfed; not a tree was left. There was no wood\r\nremaining but the planks of the rough lodging, which would not be nearly\r\nenough to build a raft to hold so many. A few days of life were all\r\nthe colonists could now hope for; June had set in, the mean temperature\r\nexceeded 68\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit, and the islet must rapidly melt.\r\n\r\nAs a forlorn hope, Hobson thought he would make a reconaissance of his\r\nlimited domain, and see if any part of it was thicker than where they\r\nwere all now encamped. In this excursion he was accompanied by Mrs\r\nBarnett and Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you still hope!\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the lady of her faithful companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope ever!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett did not answer, but walked rapidly along the coast at the\r\nLieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s side. No alteration had taken place between Cape Bathurst\r\nand Cape Esquimaux, that is to say, for a distance of eight miles. It\r\nwas at Cape Esquimaux that the fracture had taken place, and running\r\ninland, it followed a curved line as far as the beginning of the lagoon,\r\nfrom which point the shores of the lake, now bathed by the waves of the\r\nsea, formed the new coast-line. Towards the upper part of the lagoon\r\nthere was another fracture, running as far as the coast, between Cape\r\nBathurst and what was once Port Barnett, so that the islet was merely an\r\noblong strip, not more than a mile wide anywhere.\r\n\r\nOf the hundred and forty square miles which once formed the total\r\nsuperficial area of the island, only twenty remained.\r\n\r\nHobson most carefully examined the new conformation of the islet,\r\nand found that its thickest part was still at the site of the former\r\nfactory. He decided, therefore, to retain the encampment where it was,\r\nand, strange to say, the instinct of the quadrupeds still led them to\r\ncongregate about it.\r\n\r\nA great many of the animals had, however, disappeared with the rest of\r\nthe island, amongst them many of the dogs which had escaped the former\r\ncatastrophe. Most of the quadrupeds remaining were rodents; and the\r\nbear, which seemed terribly puzzled, paced round and round the islet\r\nlike a caged animal.\r\n\r\nAbout five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening the three explorers returned to the\r\ncamp. The men and women were gathered together in gloomy silence in the\r\nrough shelter still remaining to them, and Mrs Joliffe was preparing\r\nsome food. Sabine, who was less overcome than his comrades, was\r\nwandering about in the hope of getting some fresh venison, and the\r\nastronomer was sitting apart from every one, gazing at the sea in an\r\nabsent indifferent manner, as if nothing could ever rouse or astonish\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant imparted the results of his excursion to the whole party.\r\nHe told them that they were safer where they were than they would be\r\non any other spot, and he urged them not to wander about, as there were\r\nsigns of another approaching fracture half way between the camp and Cape\r\nEsquimaux. The superficial area of the islet would soon be yet further\r\nreduced, and they could do nothing, absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nThe day was really quite hot. The ice which had been \xe2\x80\x9cdisinterred\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor drinkable water melted before it was brought near the fire. Thin\r\npieces of the ice crust of the steep beach fell off into the sea, and it\r\nwas evident that the general level of the islet was being lowered by the\r\nconstant wearing away of its base in the tepid waters.\r\n\r\nNo one slept the next night. Who could have closed his eyes with the\r\nknowledge that the abyss beneath might open at any moment?\xe2\x80\x94who but the\r\nlittle unconscious child who still smiled in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and\r\nwas never for one instant out of them?\r\n\r\nThe next morning, June 4th, the sun rose in a cloudless sky. No change\r\nhad taken place in the conformation of the islet during the night.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this day a terrified blue fox rushed into the shed,\r\nand could not be induced to leave it. The martens, ermines, polar hares,\r\nmusk-rats, and beavers literally swarmed upon the site of the former\r\nfactory. The wolves alone were unrepresented, and had probably all been\r\nswallowed up with the rest of the island. The bear no longer wandered\r\nfrom Cape Bathurst, and the furred animals seemed quite unconscious of\r\nits presence; nor did the colonists notice it much, absorbed as they\r\nwere in the contemplation of the approaching doom, which had broken down\r\nall the ordinary distinctions of race.\r\n\r\nA little before noon a sudden hope\xe2\x80\x94too soon to end in\r\ndisappointment\xe2\x80\x94revived the drooping spirits of the colonists.\r\n\r\nSabine, who had been standing for some time on the highest part of the\r\nislet looking at the sea, suddenly cried\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boat! a boat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if an electric shock had suddenly ran through the group, for\r\nall started up and rushed towards the hunter.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant looked at him inquiringly, and the man pointed to a\r\nwhite vapour on the horizon. Not a word was spoken, but all watched in\r\nbreathless silence as the form of a vessel gradually rose against the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a ship, and most likely a whaler. There was no doubt about\r\nit, and at the end of an hour even the keel was visible.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this vessel appeared on the east of the islet, that is to\r\nsay, on the opposite side to that from which the raft had drifted, so\r\nthat there could be no hope that it was coming to their rescue\r\nafter meeting with the raft, which would have suggested the fact of\r\nfellow-creatures being in danger.\r\n\r\nThe question now was, would those in this vessel perceive the islet?\r\nWould they be able to make out signals on it? Alas! in broad daylight,\r\nwith a bright sun shining, it was not likely they would. Had it been\r\nnight some of the planks of the remaining shed might have made a fire\r\nlarge enough to be seen at a considerable distance, but the boat would\r\nprobably have disappeared before the darkness set in; and, although it\r\nseemed of little use, signals were made, and guns fired on the islet.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was certainly approaching, and seemed to be a large\r\nthree-master, evidently a whaler from New Archangel, which was on its\r\nway to Behring Strait after having doubled the peninsula of Alaska.\r\nIt was to the windward of the islet, and tacking to starboard with its\r\nlower sails, top sails, and top-gallant sails all set. It was steadily\r\nadvancing to the north. A sailor would have seen at a glance that it was\r\nnot bearing towards the islet, but it might even yet perceive it, and\r\nalter its course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it does see us,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Hobson in Long\xe2\x80\x99s ear, \xe2\x80\x9cit is more\r\nlikely to avoid us than to come nearer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant was right, for there is nothing vessels dread more in\r\nthese latitudes than the approach of icebergs and ice-floes; they\r\nlook upon them as floating rocks, against which there is a danger of\r\nstriking, especially in the night, and they therefore hasten to change\r\ntheir course when ice is sighted; and this vessel would most likely do\r\nthe same, if it noticed the islet at all.\r\n\r\nThe alternations of hope and despair through which the anxious watchers\r\npassed may be imagined, but cannot be described. Until two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\nthe afternoon they were able to believe that Heaven had at last taken\r\npity on them\xe2\x80\x94that help was coming\xe2\x80\x94that their safety was assured. The\r\nvessel continued to approach in an oblique direction, and was presently\r\nnot more than six miles from the islet. Signal after signal was tried,\r\ngun after gun fired, and some of the planks of the shed were burnt.\r\n\r\nAll in vain\xe2\x80\x94either they were not seen, or the vessel was anxious to\r\navoid the islet.\r\n\r\nAt half-past two it luffed slightly, and bore away to the northeast.\r\n\r\nIn another hour a white vapour was all that was visible, and that soon\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nOn this the soldier Kellet burst into a roar of hysterical laughter, and\r\nflinging himself on the ground, rolled over and over like a madman.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett turned and looked Madge full in the face, as if to ask her\r\nif she still hoped, and Madge turned away her head.\r\n\r\nOn this same ill-fated day a crackling noise was heard, and the greater\r\npart of the islet broke off, and plunged into the sea. The cries of the\r\ndrowning animals rent the air, and the islet was reduced to the narrow\r\nstrip between the site of the engulfed house and Cape Bathurst. It was\r\nnow merely a piece of ice.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. ON A PIECE OF ICE. A piece of ice, a jagged triangular\r\nstrip of ice, measuring one hundred feet at its base, and scarcely five\r\nhundred in its greatest extent; and on it twenty-one human beings, some\r\nhundred furred animals, a few dogs, and a large bear, which was at this\r\nmoment crouching at the very edge!\r\n\r\nYes! all the luckless colonists were there. Not one had yet been\r\nswallowed up. The last rupture had occurred when they were all in the\r\nshed. Thus far fate had spared them, probably that they might all perish\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nA silent sleepless night ensued. No one spoke or moved, for the\r\nslightest shake or blow might suffice to break the ice.\r\n\r\nNo one would touch the salt-meat served round by Mrs Joliffe. What would\r\nbe the good of eating?\r\n\r\nNearly every one remained in the open air, feeling that it would be\r\nbetter to be drowned in the open sea than in a narrow wooden shed.\r\n\r\nThe next day, June 5th, the sun shone brightly down upon the heads of\r\nthe doomed band of wanderers. All were still silent, and seemed anxious\r\nto avoid each other. Many gazed with troubled anxious eyes at the\r\nperfect circle of the horizon, of which the miserable little strip of\r\nice formed the centre. But the sea was absolutely deserted\xe2\x80\x94not a sail,\r\nnot an ice-floe, not an islet! Their own piece of ice was probably the\r\nvery last floating on the Behring Sea.\r\n\r\nThe temperature continued to rise. The wind had gone down, and a\r\nterrible calm had set in, a gentle swell heaved the surface of the sea,\r\nand the morsel of earth and ice, which was all that was left of Victoria\r\nIsland, rose and sank without change of position, like a wreck\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhat was it but a wreck?\r\n\r\nBut a wreck, a piece of woodwork, a broken mast, or a few planks, remain\r\nfloating; they offer some resistance to the waves, they will not melt;\r\nbut this bit of ice, this solidified water, must dissolve with the heat\r\nof the sun!\r\n\r\nThis piece of ice had formed the thickest part of the island, and this\r\nwill explain its having lasted so long. A layer of earth and plenty\r\nof vegetation covered it, and the base of ice must have been of\r\nconsiderable thickness. The long bitter Polar winters must have \xe2\x80\x9cfed\r\nit with fresh ice,\xe2\x80\x9d in the countless centuries during which it was\r\nconnected with the mainland. Even now its mean height was five or six\r\nfeet above the sea level, and its base was probably of about the same\r\nthickness. Although in these quiet waters it was not likely to be\r\nbroken, it could not fail gradually to melt, and the rapid dissolution\r\ncould actually be watched at the edges, for as the long waves licked\r\nthe sides, piece after piece of ground with its verdant covering sank to\r\nrise no more.\r\n\r\nOn this 5th June a fall of this nature occurred at about one o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nP.M., on the site of the shed itself, which was very near the edge of\r\nthe ice. There was fortunately no one in it at the time, and all that\r\nwas saved was a few planks, and two or three of the timbers of the\r\nroofs. Most of the cooking utensils and all the astronomical instruments\r\nwere lost. The colonists were now obliged to take refuge on the highest\r\npart of the islet, where nothing protected them from the weather, but\r\nfortunately a few tools had been left there, with the air pumps and\r\nthe air-vessel, which Hobson had employed for catching a little of the\r\nrain-water for drinking purposes, as he no longer dared to draw for a\r\nsupply upon the ice, every atom of which was of value.\r\n\r\nAt about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M., the soldier Kellet, the same who had\r\nalready given signs of insanity, came to Mrs Barnett and said quietly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to drown myself, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Kellet?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I am going to drown myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave thought the matter well over: there is no escape for us, and I\r\nprefer dying at once to waiting to be killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKellet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett, taking the man\xe2\x80\x99s hand and looking into\r\nhis face, which was strangely composed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will not do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; and as you have always been very good to us\r\nall, I wanted to wish you good-bye. Good-bye, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Kellet turned towards the sea. Mrs Barnett, terrified at his manner,\r\nthrew herself upon him and held him back. Her cries brought Hobson and\r\nLong to her assistance, and they did all in their power to dissuade the\r\nunhappy man from carrying out his purpose, but he was not to be moved,\r\nand merely shook his head.\r\n\r\nHis mind was evidently disordered, and it was useless to reason with\r\nhim. It was a terrible moment, as his example might lead some of his\r\ncomrades to commit suicide also. At all hazards he must be prevented\r\nfrom doing as he threatened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKellet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Barnett gently, with a half smile, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have\r\nalways been very good friends, have we not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kellet calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Kellet, if you like we will die together, but not to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my brave fellow, I am not ready; but to-morrow, to-morrow if you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier looked more fixedly than ever at the courageous woman, and\r\nseemed to hesitate an instant; then he cast a glance of fierce longing\r\nat the sea, and passing his hand over his eyes, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without another word he quietly turned away and went back to his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs Barnett; \xe2\x80\x9cI have asked him to wait\r\ntill to-morrow, and who can say whether we shall not all be drowned by\r\nthat time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThroughout that night Hobson remained motionless upon the beach,\r\npondering whether there might not yet be some means to check the\r\ndissolution of the islet\xe2\x80\x94if it might not yet be possible to preserve\r\nit until they came in sight of land of some sort.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett and Madge did not leave each other for an instant. Kalumah\r\ncrouched like a dog at the feet of her mistress, and tried to keep her\r\nwarm. Mrs Mac-Nab, wrapped in a few furs, the remains of the rich stores\r\nof Fort Hope, had fallen into a kind of torpor, with her baby clasped in\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\nThe stars shone with extraordinary brilliancy, and no sounds broke the\r\nstillness of the night but the rippling of the waves and the splash of\r\npieces of ice as they fell into the sea. The colonists, stretched upon\r\nthe ground in scattered groups, were as motionless as corpses on an\r\nabandoned wreck.\r\n\r\nSometimes Sergeant Long rose and peered into the night-mists, bat seeing\r\nnothing, he resumed his horizontal position. The bear, looking like a\r\ngreat white snowball, cowered motionless at the very edge of the strip\r\nof ice.\r\n\r\nThis night also passed away without any incident to modify the\r\nsituation. The grey morning dawned in the east, and the sun rose and\r\ndispersed the shadows of the night.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s first care, as soon as it was light, was to examine\r\nthe piece of ice. Its perimeter was still more reduced, and, alas! its\r\nmean height above the sea level had sensibly diminished. The waves,\r\nquiet as they were, washed over the greater part of it; the summit of\r\nthe little hill alone was still beyond their reach.\r\n\r\nLong, too, saw the changes which had taken place during the night, and\r\nfelt that all hope was gone.\r\n\r\nMrs Barnett joined Lieutenant Hobson, and said to him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be to-day then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam, and you will keep your promise to Kellet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Hobson,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9chave we done all in\r\nour power!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen God\xe2\x80\x99s will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne last attempt was, however, made during the day. A strong breeze set\r\nin from the offing, that is to say, a wind bearing to the south-east,\r\nthe direction in which were situated the nearest of the Aleutian\r\nIslands. How far off no one could say, as without instruments the\r\nbearings of the island could not be taken. It was not likely to have\r\ndrifted far, however, unless under the influence of the current, as it\r\ngave no hold to the wind.\r\n\r\nStill it was just possible that they might be nearer land than they\r\nthought. If only a current, the direction of which it was impossible\r\nto ascertain, had taken them nearer to the much-longed-for Aleutian\r\nIslands, then, as the wind was bearing down upon those very islands, it\r\nmight drive the strip of ice before it if a sail of some kind could\r\nbe concocted. The ice had still several hours to float, and in several\r\nhours the land might come in sight, or, if not the land, some coasting\r\nor fishing vessel.\r\n\r\nA forlorn hope truly, but it suggested an idea to the Lieutenant which\r\nhe resolved to carry out. Could not a sail be contrived on the islet\r\nas on an ordinary raft? There could be no difficulty in that; and when\r\nHobson suggested it to Mac-Nab, he exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, sir;\xe2\x80\x9d adding to his men, \xe2\x80\x9cbring out all the\r\ncanvas there is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery one was quite revived by this plan, slight as was the chance it\r\nafforded, and all lent a helping hand, even Kellet, who had not yet\r\nreminded Mrs Barnett of her promise.\r\n\r\nA beam, which had once formed part of the roof of the barracks, was sunk\r\ndeep into the earth and sand of which the little hill was composed, and\r\nfirmly fixed with ropes arranged like shrouds and a stay. A sail made\r\nof all the clothes and coverlets still remaining fastened on to a strong\r\npole for a yard, was hoisted on the mast This sail, or rather collection\r\nof sails, suitably set, swelled in the breeze, and by the wake it left,\r\nit was evident that the strip of ice was rapidly moving towards the\r\nsouth-east.\r\n\r\nIt was a success, and every one was cheered with newly-awakened hope.\r\nThey were no longer stationary; they were advancing slowly, it was true,\r\nbut still they were advancing. The carpenter was particularly elated;\r\nall eagerly scanned the horizon, and had they been told that no land\r\ncould be sighted, they would have refused to believe it.\r\n\r\nSo it appeared, however; for the strip of ice floated along on the waves\r\nfor three hours in the centre of an absolutely circular and unbroken\r\nhorizon. The poor colonists still hoped on.\r\n\r\nTowards three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the Lieutenant took the Sergeant aside, and\r\nsaid to him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are advancing at the cost of the solidity and duration of our\r\nislet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that the ice is being rapidly fretted away as it moves along.\r\nIts speed is hastening its dissolution, and since we set sail it has\r\ndiminished one-third.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely certain. The ice is longer and flatter. Look, the sea la\r\nnot more than ten feet from the hill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was true, and the result was what might naturally have been expected\r\nfrom the motion of the ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think we ought to take down\r\nour sail?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Long, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we\r\nshould consult our comrades. We ought all to share the responsibility of\r\na decision now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant bent his head in assent, and the two returned to their\r\nold position on the little hill.\r\n\r\nHobson put the case before the whole party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe speed we have given to the ice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis causing it to\r\nwear away rapidly, and will perhaps hasten the inevitable catastrophe\r\nby a few hours. My friends, you must decide whether we shall still go\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForwards!\xe2\x80\x9d cried all with one voice.\r\n\r\nSo it was decided, and, as it turned out, the decision was fraught with\r\nconsequences of incalculable importance.\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M. Madge rose, and pointing to a point on the\r\nsouth-east, cried\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery one started up as if struck by lightning. Land there was indeed,\r\non the south-east, twelve miles from the island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore sail! more sail!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Hobson.\r\n\r\nHe was understood, and fresh materials were hastily brought. On\r\nthe shrouds a sort of studding sail was rigged up of clothes, furs,\r\neverything, in short, that could give hold to the wind.\r\n\r\nThe speed increased as the wind freshened, but the ice was melting\r\neverywhere; it trembled beneath the feet of the anxious watchers, and\r\nmight open at any moment. But they would not think of that; they were\r\nbuoyed up with hope; safety was at hand, on the land they were rapidly\r\nnearing. They shouted\xe2\x80\x94they made signals\xe2\x80\x94they were in a delirium of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven the ice was much nearer the land, but it was visibly\r\nmelting, and sinking rapidly; water was gushing from it, and the waves\r\nwere washing over it, sweeping off the terrified quadrupeds before the\r\neyes of the colonists. Every instant they expected the whole mass to\r\nbe engulfed, and it was necessary to lighten it like a sinking vessel.\r\nEvery means was tried to check the dissolution; the earth and sand were\r\ncarefully spread about, especially at the edges of the ice, to protect\r\nit from the direct influence of the sunbeams; and furs were laid here\r\nand there, as being bad conductors of heat. But it was all of no avail;\r\nthe lower portion of the ice began to crack, and several fissures opened\r\nin the surface. It was now but a question of moments!\r\n\r\nNight set in, and there was nothing left for the poor colonists to do\r\nto quicken the speed of the islet. Some of them tried to paddle about on\r\nplanks. The coast was still four miles to windward.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark gloomy night, without any moon, and Hobson, whose heroic\r\ncourage did not even now fail him, shouted\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA signal, my friends! a signal!\xe2\x80\x9d A pile was made of all the\r\nremaining combustibles\xe2\x80\x94two or three planks and a beam. It was set fire\r\nto, and bright flames soon shot up, but the strip of ice continued to\r\nmelt and sink. Presently the little hill alone remained above water, and\r\non it the despairing wretches, with the few animals left alive, huddled\r\ntogether, the bear growling fiercely.\r\n\r\nThe water was still rising, and there was no sign that any one on land\r\nhad seen the signal. In less than a quarter of an hour they must all be\r\nswallowed up.\r\n\r\nCould nothing be done to make the ice last longer? In three hours, three\r\nshort hours, they might reach the land, which was now but three miles to\r\nwindward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cif only I could stop the ice from melting! I\r\nwould give my life to know how! Yes, I would give my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one way,\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly replied a voice.\r\n\r\nIt was Thomas Black who spoke, the astronomer, who had not opened his\r\nlips for so long, and who had long since appeared dead to all that was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is one way of checking the dissolution\r\nof the ice\xe2\x80\x94there is one way of saving us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll gathered eagerly round the speaker, and looked at him inquiringly.\r\nThey thought they must have misheard what he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hobson, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat way do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the pumps!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Black simply.\r\n\r\nWas he mad? Did he take the ice for a sinking vessel, with ten feet of\r\nwater in the hold?\r\n\r\nThe air pumps were at hand, together with the air vessel, which Hobson\r\nhad been using as a reservoir for drinking water, but of what use could\r\nthey be? Could they harden the ice, which was melting all over?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is mad!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the pumps!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the astronomer; \xe2\x80\x9cfill the reservoir with\r\nair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as he tells you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Barnett.\r\n\r\nThe pumps were attached to the reservoir, the cover of which was closed\r\nand bolted. The pumps were then at once set to work, and the air was\r\ncondensed under the pressure of several atmospheres. Then Black, taking\r\none of the leather pipes connected with the reservoir, and opening the\r\ncock, let the condensed air escape, walking round the ice wherever it\r\nwas melting.\r\n\r\nEvery one was astonished at the effect produced. Wherever the air was\r\nprojected by the astronomer, the fissures filled up, and the surface\r\nre-froze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted all with one voice.\r\n\r\nIt was tiring enough to work the pumps, but there were plenty of\r\nvolunteers. The edges of the ice were again solidified, as if under the\r\ninfluence of intense cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have saved us, Mr Black,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lieutenant Hobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing could be more natural,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the astronomer quietly.\r\n\r\nNothing, in fact, could have been more natural; and the physical effect\r\nproduced may be described as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons for the relegation:\xe2\x80\x94First, under the pressure\r\nof the air, the water vaporised on the surface of the ice produced\r\nintense cold, and the compressed air in expanding abstracted the heat\r\nfrom the thawed surface, which immediately re-froze. Wherever the ice\r\nwas opening the cold cemented the edges, so that it gradually regained\r\nits original solidity.\r\n\r\nThis went on for several hours, and the colonists, buoyed up by hope,\r\ntoiled on with unwearying zeal.\r\n\r\nThey were nearing the coast, and when they were about a quarter of a\r\nmile from it, the bear plunged into the sea, and swimming to the shore,\r\nsoon disappeared.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards the ice ran aground upon a beach, and the\r\nfew animals still upon it hurried away in the darkness. The colonists\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdisembarked,\xe2\x80\x9d and falling on their knees, returned thanks to God\r\nfor their miraculous deliverance.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV CONCLUSION. It was on the island of Blejinie, the last of\r\nthe Aleutian group, at the extreme south of Behring Sea, that all the\r\ncolonists of Fort Hope at last landed, after having traversed eighteen\r\nhundred miles since the breaking-up of the ice. They were hospitably\r\nreceived by some Aleutian fishermen who had hurried to their assistance,\r\nand were soon able to communicate with some English agents of the\r\nHudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company.\r\n\r\nAfter all the details we have given, it is needless to dwell on the\r\ncourage and energy of the brave little band, which had proved itself\r\nworthy of its noble leader. We know how all struggled with their\r\nmisfortunes, and how patiently they had submitted to the will of God.\r\nWe have seen Mrs Barnett cheering every one by her example and sympathy;\r\nand we know that neither she nor those with her yielded to despair when\r\nthe peninsula on which Fort Hope had been built was converted into a\r\nwandering island, when that island became an islet, and the islet a\r\nstrip of ice, nor even when that strip of ice was melting beneath the\r\ncombined influence of sun and waves. If the scheme of the Company was\r\na failure, if the new fort had perished, no one could possibly blame\r\nHobson or his companions, who had gone through such extraordinary and\r\nunexpected trials. Of the nineteen persons under the Lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharge, not one was missing, and he had even two new members in his\r\nlittle colony, Kalumah and Mrs Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s godson, Michael Mac-Nab.\r\n\r\nSix days after their rescue the shipwrecked mariners arrived at New\r\nArchangel, the capital of Russian America.\r\n\r\nHere the friends, bound together by so many dangers shared, must part,\r\nprobably for ever! Hobson and his men were to return to Fort Reliance\r\nacross English America, whilst Mrs Barnett, accompanied by Kalumah, who\r\nwould not leave her, Madge, and Thomas Black, intended to go back to\r\nEurope via San Francisco and the United States.\r\n\r\nBut whilst they were still altogether, the Lieutenant, addressing Mrs\r\nBarnett, said with considerable emotion\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, madam, for all you have been to us. You have been our\r\ncomforter, our consoler, the very soul of our little world; and I thank\r\nyou in the name of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree cheers for Mrs Barnett greeted this speech, and each soldier\r\nbegged to shake her by the hand, whilst the women embraced her\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant himself had conceived so warm an affection for the lady\r\nwho had so long been his friend and counsellor, that he could not bid\r\nher good-bye without great emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be that we shall never meet again?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs Barnett;\xe2\x80\x9d we must, we shall meet\r\nagain. If you do not come and see me in Europe, I will come back to you\r\nat Fort Reliance, or to the new factory you will found some day yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Thomas Black, who had regained the use of his tongue\r\nsince he had landed on terra firma, came forward and said, with an air\r\nof the greatest conviction\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we shall meet again in thirty-six years. My friends, I missed\r\nthe eclipse of 1860, but I will not miss that which will take place\r\nunder exactly similar conditions in the same latitudes in 1896. And\r\ntherefore I appoint a meeting with you, Lieutenant, and with you,\r\nmy dear madam, on the confines of the Arctic Ocean thirty six years\r\nhence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEnd of Part II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Fur Country, by Jules Verne\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FUR COUNTRY ***\r\n\r\nThis file should be named 8991-0.txt or 8991-0.zip\r\n\r\nProduced by N.
