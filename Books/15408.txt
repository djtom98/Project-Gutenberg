It was a funny\r\nlittle house, one of a whole row of all the same kind that made a\r\nclose pile like a row of dominoes that a child knocks over, for they\r\nwere built along a street which at this point came down a steep hill.\r\nThey were funny little houses, two stories high, with red brick fronts\r\nand long white steps.\r\n\r\nThis one little house was always very full with Miss Mathilda, an\r\nunder servant, stray dogs and cats and Anna\'s voice that scolded,\r\nmanaged, grumbled all day long.\r\n\r\n"Sallie! can\'t I leave you alone a minute but you must run to the door\r\nto see the butcher boy come down the street and there is Miss Mathilda\r\ncalling for her shoes. Can I do everything while you go around always\r\nthinking about nothing at all? If I ain\'t after you every minute you\r\nwould be forgetting all, the time, and I take all this pains, and when\r\nyou come to me you was as ragged as a buzzard and as dirty as a dog.\r\nGo and find Miss Mathilda her shoes where you put them this morning."\r\n\r\n"Peter!",--her voice rose higher,--"Peter!",--Peter was the youngest\r\nand the favorite dog,--"Peter, if you don\'t leave Baby alone,"--Baby\r\nwas an old, blind terrier that Anna had loved for many years,--"Peter\r\nif you don\'t leave Baby alone, I take a rawhide to you, you bad dog."\r\n\r\nThe good Anna had high ideals for canine chastity and discipline. The\r\nthree regular dogs, the three that always lived with Anna, Peter and\r\nold Baby, and the fluffy little Rags, who was always jumping up into\r\nthe air just to show that he was happy, together with the transients,\r\nthe many stray ones that Anna always kept until she found them homes,\r\nwere all under strict orders never to be bad one with the other.\r\n\r\nA sad disgrace did once happen in the family. A little transient\r\nterrier for whom Anna had found a home suddenly produced a crop of\r\npups. The new owners were certain that this Foxy had known no dog\r\nsince she was in their care. The good Anna held to it stoutly that her\r\nPeter and her Rags were guiltless, and she made her statement with so\r\nmuch heat that Foxy\'s owners were at last convinced that these results\r\nwere due to their neglect.\r\n\r\n"You bad dog," Anna said to Peter that night, "you bad dog."\r\n\r\n"Peter was the father of those pups," the good Anna explained to Miss\r\nMathilda, "and they look just like him too, and poor little Foxy,\r\nthey were so big that she could hardly have them, but Miss Mathilda, I\r\nwould never let those people know that Peter was so bad."\r\n\r\nPeriods of evil thinking came very regularly to Peter and to Rags and\r\nto the visitors within their gates. At such times Anna would be\r\nvery busy and scold hard, and then too she always took great care to\r\nseclude the bad dogs from each other whenever she had to leave the\r\nhouse. Sometimes just to see how good it was that she had made them,\r\nAnna would leave the room a little while and leave them all together,\r\nand then she would suddenly come back. Back would slink all the\r\nwicked-minded dogs at the sound of her hand upon the knob, and then\r\nthey would sit desolate in their corners like a lot of disappointed\r\nchildren whose stolen sugar has been taken from them.\r\n\r\nInnocent blind old Baby was the only one who preserved the dignity\r\nbecoming in a dog.\r\n\r\nYou see that Anna led an arduous and troubled life.\r\n\r\nThe good Anna was a small, spare, german woman, at this time about\r\nforty years of age. Her face was worn, her cheeks were thin, her mouth\r\ndrawn and firm, and her light blue eyes were very bright. Sometimes\r\nthey were full of lightning and sometimes full of humor, but they were\r\nalways sharp and clear.\r\n\r\nHer voice was a pleasant one, when she told the histories of bad Peter\r\nand of Baby and of little Rags. Her voice was a high and piercing one\r\nwhen she called to the teamsters and to the other wicked men, what\r\nshe wanted that should come to them, when she saw them beat a horse or\r\nkick a dog. She did not belong to any society that could stop them\r\nand she told them so most frankly, but her strained voice and her\r\nglittering eyes, and her queer piercing german english first made them\r\nafraid and then ashamed. They all knew too, that all the policemen\r\non the beat were her friends. These always respected and obeyed\r\nMiss Annie, as they called her, and promptly attended to all of her\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nFor five years Anna managed the little house for Miss Mathilda. In\r\nthese five years there were four different under servants.\r\n\r\nThe one that came first was a pretty, cheerful irish girl. Anna took\r\nher with a doubting mind. Lizzie was an obedient, happy servant, and\r\nAnna began to have a little faith. This was not for long. The pretty,\r\ncheerful Lizzie disappeared one day without her notice and with all\r\nher baggage and returned no more.\r\n\r\nThis pretty, cheerful Lizzie was succeeded by a melancholy Molly.\r\n\r\nMolly was born in America, of german parents. All her people had been\r\nlong dead or gone away. Molly had always been alone. She was a tall,\r\ndark, sallow, thin-haired creature, and she was always troubled with\r\na cough, and she had a bad temper, and always said ugly dreadful swear\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAnna found all this very hard to bear, but she kept Molly a long time\r\nout of kindness. The kitchen was constantly a battle-ground. Anna\r\nscolded and Molly swore strange oaths, and then Miss Mathilda would\r\nshut her door hard to show that she could hear it all.\r\n\r\nAt last Anna had to give it up. "Please Miss Mathilda won\'t you speak\r\nto Molly," Anna said, "I can\'t do a thing with her. I scold her, and\r\nshe don\'t seem to hear and then she swears so that she scares me. She\r\nloves you Miss Mathilda, and you scold her please once."\r\n\r\n"But Anna," cried poor Miss Mathilda, "I don\'t want to," and that\r\nlarge, cheerful, but faint hearted woman looked all aghast at such a\r\nprospect. "But you must, please Miss Mathilda!" Anna said.\r\n\r\nMiss Mathilda never wanted to do any scolding. "But you must please\r\nMiss Mathilda," Anna said.\r\n\r\nMiss Mathilda every day put off the scolding, hoping always that Anna\r\nwould learn to manage Molly better. It never did get better and at\r\nlast Miss Mathilda saw that the scolding simply had to be.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed between the good Anna and her Miss Mathilda that Anna\r\nshould be away when Molly would be scolded. The next evening that it\r\nwas Anna\'s evening out, Miss Mathilda faced her task and went down\r\ninto the kitchen.\r\n\r\nMolly was sitting in the little kitchen leaning her elbows on the\r\ntable. She was a tall, thin, sallow girl, aged twenty-three, by nature\r\nslatternly and careless but trained by Anna into superficial neatness.\r\nHer drab striped cotton dress and gray black checked apron increased\r\nthe length and sadness of her melancholy figure. "Oh, Lord!" groaned\r\nMiss Mathilda to herself as she approached her.\r\n\r\n"Molly, I want to speak to you about your behaviour to Anna!", here\r\nMolly dropped her head still lower on her arms and began to cry.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Oh!" groaned Miss Mathilda.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all Miss Annie\'s fault, all of it," Molly said at last, in a\r\ntrembling voice, "I do my best."\r\n\r\n"I know Anna is often hard to please," began Miss Mathilda, with a\r\ntwinge of mischief, and then she sobered herself to her task, "but\r\nyou must remember, Molly, she means it for your good and she is really\r\nvery kind to you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want her kindness," Molly cried, "I wish you would tell me\r\nwhat to do, Miss Mathilda, and then I would be all right. I hate Miss\r\nAnnie."\r\n\r\n"This will never do Molly," Miss Mathilda said sternly, in her\r\ndeepest, firmest tones, "Anna is the head of the kitchen and you must\r\neither obey her or leave."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to leave you," whimpered melancholy Molly. "Well Molly\r\nthen try and do better," answered Miss Mathilda, keeping a good stern\r\nfront, and backing quickly from the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Oh!" groaned Miss Mathilda, as she went back up the stairs.\r\n\r\nMiss Mathilda\'s attempt to make peace between the constantly\r\ncontending women in the kitchen had no real effect. They were very\r\nsoon as bitter as before.\r\n\r\nAt last it was decided that Molly was to go away. Molly went away to\r\nwork in a factory in the town, and she went to live with an old woman\r\nin the slums, a very bad old woman Anna said.\r\n\r\nAnna was never easy in her mind about the fate of Molly. Sometimes she\r\nwould see or hear of her. Molly was not well, her cough was worse, and\r\nthe old woman really was a bad one.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of this unwholesome life, Molly was completely broken\r\ndown. Anna then again took her in charge. She brought her from her\r\nwork and from the woman where she lived, and put her in a hospital to\r\nstay till she was well. She found a place for her as nursemaid to a\r\nlittle girl out in the country, and Molly was at last established and\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nMolly had had, at first, no regular successor. In a few months it was\r\ngoing to be the summer and Miss Mathilda would be gone away, and old\r\nKatie would do very well to come in every day and help Anna with her\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOld Katy was a heavy, ugly, short and rough old german woman, with a\r\nstrange distorted german-english all her own. Anna was worn out now\r\nwith her attempt to make the younger generation do all that it should\r\nand rough old Katy never answered back, and never wanted her own\r\nway. No scolding or abuse could make its mark on her uncouth and aged\r\npeasant hide. She said her "Yes, Miss Annie," when an answer had to\r\ncome, and that was always all that she could say.\r\n\r\n"Old Katy is just a rough old woman, Miss Mathilda," Anna said, "but\r\nI think I keep her here with me. She can work and she don\'t give me\r\ntrouble like I had with Molly all the time."\r\n\r\nAnna always had a humorous sense from this old Katy\'s twisted peasant\r\nenglish, from the roughness on her tongue of buzzing s\'s and from the\r\nqueer ways of her brutish servile humor. Anna could not let old Katy\r\nserve at table--old Katy was too coarsely made from natural earth for\r\nthat--and so Anna had all this to do herself and that she never liked,\r\nbut even then this simple rough old creature was pleasanter to her\r\nthan any of the upstart young.\r\n\r\nLife went on very smoothly now in these few months before the summer\r\ncame. Miss Mathilda every summer went away across the ocean to be gone\r\nfor several months. When she went away this summer old Katy was so\r\nsorry, and on the day that Miss Mathilda went, old Katy cried hard\r\nfor many hours. An earthy, uncouth, servile peasant creature old Katy\r\nsurely was. She stood there on the white stone steps of the little red\r\nbrick house, with her bony, square dull head with its thin, tanned,\r\ntoughened skin and its sparse and kinky grizzled hair, and her strong,\r\nsquat figure a little overmade on the right side, clothed in her blue\r\nstriped cotton dress, all clean and always washed but rough and harsh\r\nto see--and she stayed there on the steps till Anna brought her in,\r\nblubbering, her apron to her face, and making queer guttural broken\r\nmoans.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Mathilda early in the fall came to her house again old Katy\r\nwas not there.\r\n\r\n"I never thought old Katy would act so Miss Mathilda," Anna said,\r\n"when she was so sorry when you went away, and I gave her full wages\r\nall the summer, but they are all alike Miss Mathilda, there isn\'t one\r\nof them that\'s fit to trust. You know how Katy said she liked you,\r\nMiss Mathilda, and went on about it when you went away and then she\r\nwas so good and worked all right until the middle of the summer, when\r\nI got sick, and then she went away and left me all alone and took a\r\nplace out in the country, where they gave her some more money. She\r\ndidn\'t say a word, Miss Mathilda, she just went off and left me there\r\nalone when I was sick after that awful hot summer that we had, and\r\nafter all we done for her when she had no place to go, and all summer\r\nI gave her better things to eat than I had for myself. Miss Mathilda,\r\nthere isn\'t one of them has any sense of what\'s the right way for a\r\ngirl to do, not one of them."\r\n\r\nOld Katy was never heard from any more.\r\n\r\nNo under servant was decided upon now for several months. Many came\r\nand many went, and none of them would do. At last Anna heard of\r\nSallie.\r\n\r\nSallie was the oldest girl in a family of eleven and Sallie was just\r\nsixteen years old. From Sallie down they came always littler and\r\nlittler in her family, and all of them were always out at work\r\nexcepting only the few littlest of them all.\r\n\r\nSallie was a pretty blonde and smiling german girl, and stupid and a\r\nlittle silly. The littler they came in her family the brighter they\r\nall were. The brightest of them all was a little girl of ten. She did\r\na good day\'s work washing dishes for a man and wife in a saloon, and\r\nshe earned a fair day\'s wage, and then there was one littler still.\r\nShe only worked for half the day. She did the house work for a\r\nbachelor doctor. She did it all, all of the housework and received\r\neach week her eight cents for her wage. Anna was always indignant when\r\nshe told that story.\r\n\r\n"I think he ought to give her ten cents Miss Mathilda any way. Eight\r\ncents is so mean when she does all his work and she is such a bright\r\nlittle thing too, not stupid like our Sallie. Sallie would never learn\r\nto do a thing if I didn\'t scold her all the time, but Sallie is a good\r\ngirl, and I take care and she will do all right."\r\n\r\nSallie was a good, obedient german child. She never answered Anna\r\nback, no more did Peter, old Baby and little Rags and so though\r\nalways Anna\'s voice was sharply raised in strong rebuke and worn\r\nexpostulation, they were a happy family all there together in the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nAnna was a mother now to Sallie, a good incessant german mother who\r\nwatched and scolded hard to keep the girl from any evil step. Sallie\'s\r\ntemptations and transgressions were much like those of naughty Peter\r\nand jolly little Rags, and Anna took the same way to keep all three\r\nfrom doing what was bad.\r\n\r\nSallie\'s chief badness besides forgetting all the time and never\r\nwashing her hands clean to serve at table, was the butcher boy.\r\n\r\nHe was an unattractive youth enough, that butcher boy. Suspicion began\r\nto close in around Sallie that she spent the evenings when Anna was\r\naway, in company with this bad boy.\r\n\r\n"Sallie is such a pretty girl, Miss Mathilda," Anna said, "and she is\r\nso dumb and silly, and she puts on that red waist, and she crinkles\r\nup her hair with irons so I have to laugh, and then I tell her if she\r\nonly washed her hands clean it would be better than all that fixing\r\nall the time, but you can\'t do a thing with the young girls nowadays\r\nMiss Mathilda. Sallie is a good girl but I got to watch her all the\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nSuspicion closed in around Sallie more and more, that she spent Anna\'s\r\nevenings out with this boy sitting in the kitchen. One early morning\r\nAnna\'s voice was sharply raised.\r\n\r\n"Sallie this ain\'t the same banana that I brought home yesterday, for\r\nMiss Mathilda, for her breakfast, and you was out early in the street\r\nthis morning, what was you doing there?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Miss Annie, I just went out to see, that\'s all and that\'s\r\nthe same banana, \'deed it is Miss Annie."\r\n\r\n"Sallie, how can you say so and after all I do for you, and Miss\r\nMathilda is so good to you. I never brought home no bananas yesterday\r\nwith specks on it like that. I know better, it was that boy was here\r\nlast night and ate it while I was away, and you was out to get another\r\nthis morning. I don\'t want no lying Sallie."\r\n\r\nSallie was stout in her defence but then she gave it up and she said\r\nit was the boy who snatched it as he ran away at the sound of Anna\'s\r\nkey opening the outside door. "But I will never let him in again, Miss\r\nAnnie, \'deed I won\'t," said Sallie.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was all peaceful for some weeks and then Sallie with\r\nfatuous simplicity began on certain evenings to resume her bright red\r\nwaist, her bits of jewels and her crinkly hair.\r\n\r\nOne pleasant evening in the early spring, Miss Mathilda was standing\r\non the steps beside the open door, feeling cheerful in the pleasant,\r\ngentle night. Anna came down the street, returning from her evening\r\nout. "Don\'t shut the door, please, Miss Mathilda," Anna said in a low\r\nvoice, "I don\'t want Sallie to know I\'m home."\r\n\r\nAnna went softly through the house and reached the kitchen door. At\r\nthe sound of her hand upon the knob there was a wild scramble and\r\na bang, and then Sallie sitting there alone when Anna came into the\r\nroom, but, alas, the butcher boy forgot his overcoat in his escape.\r\n\r\nYou see that Anna led an arduous and troubled life.\r\n\r\nAnna had her troubles, too, with Miss Mathilda. "And I slave and slave\r\nto save the money and you go out and spend it all on foolishness,"\r\nthe good Anna would complain when her mistress, a large and careless\r\nwoman, would come home with a bit of porcelain, a new etching and\r\nsometimes even an oil painting on her arm.\r\n\r\n"But Anna," argued Miss Mathilda, "if you didn\'t save this money,\r\ndon\'t you see I could not buy these things," and then Anna would\r\nsoften and look pleased until she learned the price, and then wringing\r\nher hands, "Oh, Miss Mathilda, Miss Mathilda," she would cry, "and you\r\ngave all that money out for that, when you need a dress to go out in\r\nso bad." "Well, perhaps I will get one for myself next year, Anna,"\r\nMiss Mathilda would cheerfully concede. "If we live till then Miss\r\nMathilda, I see that you do," Anna would then answer darkly.\r\n\r\nAnna had great pride in the knowledge and possessions of her cherished\r\nMiss Mathilda, but she did not like her careless way of wearing always\r\nher old clothes. "You can\'t go out to dinner in that dress, Miss\r\nMathilda," she would say, standing firmly before the outside door,\r\n"You got to go and put on your new dress you always look so nice in."\r\n"But Anna, there isn\'t time." "Yes there is, I go up and help you fix\r\nit, please Miss Mathilda you can\'t go out to dinner in that dress and\r\nnext year if we live till then, I make you get a new hat, too. It\'s a\r\nshame Miss Mathilda to go out like that."\r\n\r\nThe poor mistress sighed and had to yield. It suited her cheerful,\r\nlazy temper to be always without care but sometimes it was a burden\r\nto endure, for so often she had it all to do again unless she made a\r\nrapid dash out of the door before Anna had a chance to see.\r\n\r\nLife was very easy always for this large and lazy Miss Mathilda, with\r\nthe good Anna to watch and care for her and all her clothes and goods.\r\nBut, alas, this world of ours is after all much what it should be and\r\ncheerful Miss Mathilda had her troubles too with Anna.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant that everything for one was done, but annoying often\r\nthat what one wanted most just then, one could not have when one\r\nhad foolishly demanded and not suggested one\'s desire. And then Miss\r\nMathilda loved to go out on joyous, country tramps when, stretching\r\nfree and far with cheerful comrades, over rolling hills and\r\ncornfields, glorious in the setting sun, and dogwood white and shining\r\nunderneath the moon and clear stars over head, and brilliant air and\r\ntingling blood, it was hard to have to think of Anna\'s anger at the\r\nlate return, though Miss Mathilda had begged that there might be no\r\nhot supper cooked that night. And then when all the happy crew of\r\nMiss Mathilda and her friends, tired with fullness of good health and\r\nburning winds and glowing sunshine in the eyes, stiffened and justly\r\nworn and wholly ripe for pleasant food and gentle content, were all\r\ncome together to the little house--it was hard for all that tired crew\r\nwho loved the good things Anna made to eat, to come to the closed\r\ndoor and wonder there if it was Anna\'s evening in or out, and then the\r\nothers must wait shivering on their tired feet, while Miss Mathilda\r\nsoftened Anna\'s heart, or if Anna was well out, boldly ordered\r\nyouthful Sallie to feed all the hungry lot.\r\n\r\nSuch things were sometimes hard to bear and often grievously did\r\nMiss Mathilda feel herself a rebel with the cheerful Lizzies, the\r\nmelancholy Mollies, the rough old Katies and the stupid Sallies.\r\n\r\nMiss Mathilda had other troubles too, with the good Anna. Miss\r\nMathilda had to save her Anna from the many friends, who in the kindly\r\nfashion of the poor, used up her savings and then gave her promises in\r\nplace of payments.\r\n\r\nThe good Anna had many curious friends that she had found in the\r\ntwenty years that she had lived in Bridgepoint, and Miss Mathilda\r\nwould often have to save her from them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE GOOD ANNA\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Federner, this good Anna, was of solid lower middle-class south\r\ngerman stock.\r\n\r\nWhen she was seventeen years old she went to service in a bourgeois\r\nfamily, in the large city near her native town, but she did not stay\r\nthere long. One day her mistress offered her maid--that was Anna--to\r\na friend, to see her home. Anna felt herself to be a servant, not a\r\nmaid, and so she promptly left the place.\r\n\r\nAnna had always a firm old world sense of what was the right way for a\r\ngirl to do.\r\n\r\nNo argument could bring her to sit an evening in the empty parlour,\r\nalthough the smell of paint when they were fixing up the kitchen made\r\nher very sick, and tired as she always was, she never would sit down\r\nduring the long talks she held with Miss Mathilda. A girl was a girl\r\nand should act always like a girl, both as to giving all respect and\r\nas to what she had to eat.\r\n\r\nA little time after she left this service, Anna and her mother made\r\nthe voyage to America. They came second-class, but it was for them a\r\nlong and dreary journey. The mother was already ill with consumption.\r\n\r\nThey landed in a pleasant town in the far South and there the mother\r\nslowly died.\r\n\r\nAnna was now alone and she made her way to Bridgepoint where an older\r\nhalf brother was already settled. This brother was a heavy, lumbering,\r\ngood natured german man, full of the infirmity that comes of excess of\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nHe was a baker and married and fairly well to do.\r\n\r\nAnna liked her brother well enough but was never in any way dependent\r\non him.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived in Bridgepoint, she took service with Miss Mary\r\nWadsmith.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Wadsmith was a large, fair, helpless woman, burdened with\r\nthe care of two young children. They had been left her by her brother\r\nand his wife who had died within a few months of each other.\r\n\r\nAnna soon had the household altogether in her charge.\r\n\r\nAnna found her place with large, abundant women, for such were always\r\nlazy, careless or all helpless, and so the burden of their lives could\r\nfall on Anna, and give her just content. Anna\'s superiors must be\r\nalways these large helpless women, or be men, for none others could\r\ngive themselves to be made so comfortable and free.\r\n\r\nAnna had no strong natural feeling to love children, as she had to\r\nlove cats and dogs, and a large mistress. She never became deeply fond\r\nof Edgar and Jane Wadsmith. She naturally preferred the boy, for boys\r\nlove always better to be done for and made comfortable and full of\r\neating, while in the little girl she had to meet the feminine, the\r\nsubtle opposition, showing so early always in a young girl\'s nature.\r\n\r\nFor the summer, the Wadsmiths had a pleasant house out in the country,\r\nand the winter months they spent in hotel apartments in the city.\r\n\r\nGradually it came to Anna to take the whole direction of their\r\nmovements, to make all the decisions as to their journeyings to and\r\nfro, and for the arranging of the places where they were to live.\r\n\r\nAnna had been with Miss Mary for three years, when little Jane began\r\nto raise her strength in opposition. Jane was a neat, pleasant little\r\ngirl, pretty and sweet with a young girl\'s charm, and with two blonde\r\nbraids carefully plaited down her back.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary, like her Anna, had no strong natural feeling to love\r\nchildren, but she was fond of these two young ones of her blood, and\r\nyielded docilely to the stronger power in the really pleasing little\r\ngirl. Anna always preferred the rougher handling of the boy, while\r\nMiss Mary found the gentle force and the sweet domination of the girl\r\nto please her better.\r\n\r\nIn a spring when all the preparations for the moving had been made,\r\nMiss Mary and Jane went together to the country home, and Anna, after\r\nfinishing up the city matters was to follow them in a few days with\r\nEdgar, whose vacation had not yet begun.\r\n\r\nMany times during the preparations for this summer, Jane had met Anna\r\nwith sharp resistance, in opposition to her ways. It was simple for\r\nlittle Jane to give unpleasant orders, not from herself but from Miss\r\nMary, large, docile, helpless Miss Mary Wadsmith who could never think\r\nout any orders to give Anna from herself.\r\n\r\nAnna\'s eyes grew slowly sharper, harder, and her lower teeth thrust a\r\nlittle forward and pressing strongly up, framed always more slowly the\r\n"Yes, Miss Jane," to the quick, "Oh Anna! Miss Mary says she wants you\r\nto do it so!"\r\n\r\nOn the day of their migration, Miss Mary had been already put into the\r\ncarriage. "Oh, Anna!" cried little Jane running back into the house,\r\n"Miss Mary says that you are to bring along the blue dressings out of\r\nher room and mine." Anna\'s body stiffened, "We never use them in the\r\nsummer, Miss Jane," she said thickly. "Yes Anna, but Miss Mary thinks\r\nit would be nice, and she told me to tell you not to forget, good-by!"\r\nand the little girl skipped lightly down the steps into the carriage\r\nand they drove away.\r\n\r\nAnna stood still on the steps, her eyes hard and sharp and shining,\r\nand her body and her face stiff with resentment. And then she went\r\ninto the house, giving the door a shattering slam.\r\n\r\nAnna was very hard to live with in those next three days. Even Baby,\r\nthe new puppy, the pride of Anna\'s heart, a present from her friend\r\nthe widow, Mrs. Lehntman--even this pretty little black and tan felt\r\nthe heat of Anna\'s scorching flame. And Edgar, who had looked forward\r\nto these days, to be for him filled full of freedom and of things to\r\neat--he could not rest a moment in Anna\'s bitter sight.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, Anna and Edgar went to the Wadsmith country home.\r\nThe blue dressings out of the two rooms remained behind.\r\n\r\nAll the way, Edgar sat in front with the colored man and drove. It was\r\nan early spring day in the South. The fields and woods were heavy from\r\nthe soaking rains. The horses dragged the carriage slowly over the\r\nlong road, sticky with brown clay and rough with masses of stones\r\nthrown here and there to be broken and trodden into place by passing\r\nteams. Over and through the soaking earth was the feathery new spring\r\ngrowth of little flowers, of young leaves and of ferns. The tree tops\r\nwere all bright with reds and yellows, with brilliant gleaming whites\r\nand gorgeous greens. All the lower air was full of the damp haze\r\nrising from heavy soaking water on the earth, mingled with a warm and\r\npleasant smell from the blue smoke of the spring fires in all the open\r\nfields. And above all this was the clear, upper air, and the songs of\r\nbirds and the joy of sunshine and of lengthening days.\r\n\r\nThe languor and the stir, the warmth and weight and the strong feel\r\nof life from the deep centres of the earth that comes always with the\r\nearly, soaking spring, when it is not answered with an active fervent\r\njoy, gives always anger, irritation and unrest.\r\n\r\nTo Anna alone there in the carriage, drawing always nearer to the\r\nstruggle with her mistress, the warmth, the slowness, the jolting over\r\nstones, the steaming from the horses, the cries of men and animals and\r\nbirds, and the new life all round about were simply maddening. "Baby!\r\nif you don\'t lie still, I think I kill you. I can\'t stand it any more\r\nlike this."\r\n\r\nAt this time Anna, about twenty-seven years of age, was not yet all\r\nthin and worn. The sharp bony edges and corners of her head and face\r\nwere still rounded out with flesh, but already the temper and the\r\nhumor showed sharply in her clean blue eyes, and the thinning was\r\nbegun about the lower jaw, that was so often strained with the upward\r\npressure of resolve.\r\n\r\nTo-day, alone there in the carriage, she was all stiff and yet all\r\ntrembling with the sore effort of decision and revolt.\r\n\r\nAs the carriage turned into the Wadsmith gate, little Jane ran out to\r\nsee. She just looked at Anna\'s face; she did not say a word about blue\r\ndressings.\r\n\r\nAnna got down from the carriage with little Baby in her arms. She took\r\nout all the goods that she had brought and the carriage drove away.\r\nAnna left everything on the porch, and went in to where Miss Mary\r\nWadsmith was sitting by the fire.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary was sitting in a large armchair by the fire. All the nooks\r\nand crannies of the chair were filled full of her soft and spreading\r\nbody. She was dressed in a black satin morning gown, the sleeves,\r\ngreat monster things, were heavy with the mass of her soft flesh.\r\nShe sat there always, large, helpless, gentle. She had a fair, soft,\r\nregular, good-looking face, with pleasant, empty, grey-blue eyes, and\r\nheavy sleepy lids.\r\n\r\nBehind Miss Mary was the little Jane, nervous and jerky with\r\nexcitement as she saw Anna come into the room.\r\n\r\n"Miss Mary," Anna began. She had stopped just within the door, her\r\nbody and her face stiff with repression, her teeth closed hard and the\r\nwhite lights flashing sharply in the pale, clean blue of her eyes.\r\nHer bearing was full of the strange coquetry of anger and of fear,\r\nthe stiffness, the bridling, the suggestive movement underneath the\r\nrigidness of forced control, all the queer ways the passions have to\r\nshow themselves all one.\r\n\r\n"Miss Mary," the words came slowly with thick utterance and with\r\njerks, but always firm and strong. "Miss Mary, I can\'t stand it\r\nany more like this. When you tell me anything to do, I do it. I do\r\neverything I can and you know I work myself sick for you. The blue\r\ndressings in your room makes too much work to have for summer. Miss\r\nJane don\'t know what work is. If you want to do things like that I go\r\naway."\r\n\r\nAnna stopped still. Her words had not the strength of meaning\r\nthey were meant to have, but the power in the mood of Anna\'s soul\r\nfrightened and awed Miss Mary through and through.\r\n\r\nLike in all large and helpless women, Miss Mary\'s heart beat weakly in\r\nthe soft and helpless mass it had to govern. Little Jane\'s excitements\r\nhad already tried her strength. Now she grew pale and fainted quite\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Miss Mary!" cried Anna running to her mistress and supporting all her\r\nhelpless weight back in the chair. Little Jane, distracted, flew about\r\nas Anna ordered, bringing smelling salts and brandy and vinegar and\r\nwater and chafing poor Miss Mary\'s wrists.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary slowly opened her mild eyes. Anna sent the weeping little\r\nJane out of the room. She herself managed to get Miss Mary quiet on\r\nthe couch.\r\n\r\nThere was never a word more said about blue dressings.\r\n\r\nAnna had conquered, and a few days later little Jane gave her a green\r\nparrot to make peace.\r\n\r\nFor six more years little Jane and Anna lived in the same house. They\r\nwere careful and respectful to each other to the end.\r\n\r\nAnna liked the parrot very well. She was fond of cats too and of\r\nhorses, but best of all animals she loved the dog and best of all\r\ndogs, little Baby, the first gift from her friend, the widow Mrs.\r\nLehntman.\r\n\r\nThe widow Mrs. Lehntman was the romance in Anna\'s life.\r\n\r\nAnna met her first at the house of her half brother, the baker, who\r\nhad known the late Mr. Lehntman, a small grocer, very well.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman had been for many years a midwife. Since her husband\'s\r\ndeath she had herself and two young children to support.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman was a good looking woman. She had a plump well rounded\r\nbody, clear olive skin, bright dark eyes and crisp black curling\r\nhair. She was pleasant, magnetic, efficient and good. She was very\r\nattractive, very generous and very amiable.\r\n\r\nShe was a few years older than our good Anna, who was soon entirely\r\nsubdued by her magnetic, sympathetic charm.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman in her work loved best to deliver young girls who were\r\nin trouble. She would take these into her own house and care for them\r\nin secret, till they could guiltlessly go home or back to work, and\r\nthen slowly pay her the money for their care. And so through this new\r\nfriend Anna led a wider and more entertaining life, and often she used\r\nup her savings in helping Mrs. Lehntman through those times when she\r\nwas giving very much more than she got.\r\n\r\nIt was through Mrs. Lehntman that Anna met Dr. Shonjen who employed\r\nher when at last it had to be that she must go away from her Miss Mary\r\nWadsmith.\r\n\r\nDuring the last years with her Miss Mary, Anna\'s health was very bad,\r\nas indeed it always was from that time on until the end of her strong\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAnna was a medium sized, thin, hard working, worrying woman.\r\n\r\nShe had always had bad headaches and now they came more often and more\r\nwearing.\r\n\r\nHer face grew thin, more bony and more worn, her skin stained itself\r\npale yellow, as it does with working sickly women, and the clear blue\r\nof her eyes went pale.\r\n\r\nHer back troubled her a good deal, too. She was always tired at her\r\nwork and her temper grew more difficult and fretful.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Wadsmith often tried to make Anna see a little to herself,\r\nand get a doctor, and the little Jane, now blossoming into a pretty,\r\nsweet young woman, did her best to make Anna do things for her good.\r\nAnna was stubborn always to Miss Jane, and fearful of interference\r\nin her ways. Miss Mary Wadsmith\'s mild advice she easily could always\r\nturn aside.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman was the only one who had any power over Anna. She\r\ninduced her to let Dr. Shonjen take her in his care.\r\n\r\nNo one but a Dr. Shonjen could have brought a good and german Anna\r\nfirst to stop her work and then submit herself to operation, but he\r\nknew so well how to deal with german and poor people. Cheery, jovial,\r\nhearty, full of jokes that made much fun and yet were full of simple\r\ncommon sense and reasoning courage, he could persuade even a good Anna\r\nto do things that were for her own good.\r\n\r\nEdgar had now been for some years away from home, first at a school\r\nand then at work to prepare himself to be a civil engineer. Miss Mary\r\nand Jane promised to take a trip for all the time that Anna was away,\r\nand so there would be no need for Anna\'s work, nor for a new girl to\r\ntake Anna\'s place.\r\n\r\nAnna\'s mind was thus a little set at rest. She gave herself to Mrs.\r\nLehntman and the doctor to do what they thought best to make her well\r\nand strong.\r\n\r\nAnna endured the operation very well, and was patient, almost docile,\r\nin the slow recovery of her working strength. But when she was once\r\nmore at work for her Miss Mary Wadsmith, all the good effect of these\r\nseveral months of rest were soon worked and worried well away.\r\n\r\nFor all the rest of her strong working life Anna was never really\r\nwell. She had bad headaches all the time and she was always thin and\r\nworn.\r\n\r\nShe worked away her appetite, her health and strength, and always for\r\nthe sake of those who begged her not to work so hard. To her thinking,\r\nin her stubborn, faithful, german soul, this was the right way for a\r\ngirl to do.\r\n\r\nAnna\'s life with Miss Mary Wadsmith was now drawing to an end.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane, now altogether a young lady, had come out into the world.\r\nSoon she would become engaged and then be married, and then perhaps\r\nMiss Mary Wadsmith would make her home with her.\r\n\r\nIn such a household Anna was certain that she would never take a\r\nplace. Miss Jane was always careful and respectful and very good to\r\nAnna, but never could Anna be a girl in a household where Miss Jane\r\nwould be the head. This much was very certain in her mind, and so\r\nthese last two years with her Miss Mary were not as happy as before.\r\n\r\nThe change came very soon.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane became engaged and in a few months was to marry a man from\r\nout of town, from Curden, an hour\'s railway ride from Bridgepoint.\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Mary Wadsmith did not know the strong resolve Anna had made\r\nto live apart from her when this new household should be formed. Anna\r\nfound it very hard to speak to her Miss Mary of this change.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the wedding went on day and night.\r\n\r\nAnna worked and sewed hard to make it all go well.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary was much fluttered, but content and happy with Anna to make\r\neverything so easy for them all.\r\n\r\nAnna worked so all the time to drown her sorrow and her conscience\r\ntoo, for somehow it was not right to leave Miss Mary so. But what else\r\ncould she do? She could not live as her Miss Mary\'s girl, in a house\r\nwhere Miss Jane would be the head.\r\n\r\nThe wedding day grew always nearer. At last it came and passed.\r\n\r\nThe young people went on their wedding trip, and Anna and Miss Mary\r\nwere left behind to pack up all the things.\r\n\r\nEven yet poor Anna had not had the strength to tell Miss Mary her\r\nresolve, but now it had to be.\r\n\r\nAnna every spare minute ran to her friend Mrs. Lehntman for comfort\r\nand advice. She begged her friend to be with her when she told the\r\nnews to Miss Mary.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if Mrs. Lehntman had not been in Bridgepoint, Anna would have\r\ntried to live in the new house. Mrs. Lehntman did not urge her to this\r\nthing nor even give her this advice, but feeling for Mrs. Lehntman as\r\nshe did made even faithful Anna not quite so strong in her dependence\r\non Miss Mary\'s need as she would otherwise have been.\r\n\r\nRemember, Mrs. Lehntman was the romance in Anna\'s life.\r\n\r\nAll the packing was now done and in a few days Miss Mary was to go to\r\nthe new house, where the young people were ready for her coming.\r\n\r\nAt last Anna had to speak.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman agreed to go with her and help to make the matter clear\r\nto poor Miss Mary.\r\n\r\nThe two women came together to Miss Mary Wadsmith sitting placid by\r\nthe fire in the empty living room. Miss Mary had seen Mrs. Lehntman\r\nmany times before, and so her coming in with Anna raised no suspicion\r\nin her mind.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard for the two women to begin.\r\n\r\nIt must be very gently done, this telling to Miss Mary of the change.\r\nShe must not be shocked by suddenness or with excitement.\r\n\r\nAnna was all stiff, and inside all a quiver with shame, anxiety\r\nand grief. Even courageous Mrs. Lehntman, efficient, impulsive and\r\ncomplacent as she was and not deeply concerned in the event, felt\r\nawkward, abashed and almost guilty in that large, mild, helpless\r\npresence. And at her side to make her feel the power of it all, was\r\nthe intense conviction of poor Anna, struggling to be unfeeling, self\r\nrighteous and suppressed.\r\n\r\n"Miss Mary"--with Anna when things had to come they came always sharp\r\nand short--"Miss Mary, Mrs. Lehntman has come here with me, so I can\r\ntell you about not staying with you there in Curden. Of course I go\r\nhelp you to get settled and then I think I come back and stay right\r\nhere in Bridgepoint. You know my brother he is here and all his\r\nfamily, and I think it would be not right to go away from them so far,\r\nand you know you don\'t want me now so much Miss Mary when you are all\r\ntogether there in Curden."\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Wadsmith was puzzled. She did not understand what Anna meant\r\nby what she said.\r\n\r\n"Why Anna of course you can come to see your brother whenever you\r\nlike to, and I will always pay your fare. I thought you understood all\r\nabout that, and we will be very glad to have your nieces come to stay\r\nwith you as often as they like. There will always be room enough in a\r\nbig house like Mr. Goldthwaite\'s."\r\n\r\nIt was now for Mrs. Lehntman to begin her work.\r\n\r\n"Miss Wadsmith does not understand just what you mean Anna," she\r\nbegan. "Miss Wadsmith, Anna feels how good and kind you are, and she\r\ntalks about it all the time, and what you do for her in every way you\r\ncan, and she is very grateful and never would want to go away from\r\nyou, only she thinks it would be better now that Mrs. Goldthwaite\r\nhas this big new house and will want to manage it in her own way,\r\nshe thinks perhaps it would be better if Mrs. Goldthwaite had all new\r\nservants with her to begin with, and not a girl like Anna who knew her\r\nwhen she was a little girl. That is what Anna feels about it now, and\r\nshe asked me and I said to her that I thought it would be better for\r\nyou all and you knew she liked you so much and that you were so good\r\nto her, and you would understand how she thought it would be better\r\nin the new house if she stayed on here in Bridgepoint, anyway for a\r\nlittle while until Mrs. Goldthwaite was used to her new house. Isn\'t\r\nthat it Anna that you wanted Miss Wadsmith to know?"\r\n\r\n"Oh Anna," Miss Mary Wadsmith said it slowly and in a grieved tone of\r\nsurprise that was very hard for the good Anna to endure, "Oh Anna,\r\nI didn\'t think that you would ever want to leave me after all these\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"Miss Mary!" it came in one tense jerky burst, "Miss Mary it\'s only\r\nworking under Miss Jane now would make me leave you so. I know how\r\ngood you are and I work myself sick for you and for Mr. Edgar and for\r\nMiss Jane too, only Miss Jane she will want everything different from\r\nlike the way we always did, and you know Miss Mary I can\'t have Miss\r\nJane watching at me all the time, and every minute something new. Miss\r\nMary, it would be very bad and Miss Jane don\'t really want me to come\r\nwith you to the new house, I know that all the time. Please Miss Mary\r\ndon\'t feel bad about it or think I ever want to go away from you if I\r\ncould do things right for you the way they ought to be."\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Mary. Struggling was not a thing for her to do. Anna would\r\nsurely yield if she would struggle, but struggling was too much work\r\nand too much worry for peaceful Miss Mary to endure. If Anna would do\r\nso she must. Poor Miss Mary Wadsmith sighed, looked wistfully at Anna\r\nand then gave it up.\r\n\r\n"You must do as you think best Anna," she said at last letting all of\r\nher soft self sink back into the chair. "I am very sorry and so I am\r\nsure will be Miss Jane when she hears what you have thought it best to\r\ndo. It was very good of Mrs. Lehntman to come with you and I am sure\r\nshe does it for your good. I suppose you want to go out a little now.\r\nCome back in an hour Anna and help me go to bed." Miss Mary closed her\r\neyes and rested still and placid by the fire.\r\n\r\nThe two women went away.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of Anna\'s service with Miss Mary Wadsmith, and soon\r\nher new life taking care of Dr. Shonjen was begun.\r\n\r\nKeeping house for a jovial bachelor doctor gave new elements of\r\nunderstanding to Anna\'s maiden german mind. Her habits were as firm\r\nfixed as before, but it always was with Anna that things that had been\r\ndone once with her enjoyment and consent could always happen any\r\ntime again, such as her getting up at any hour of the night to make\r\na supper and cook hot chops and chicken fry for Dr. Shonjen and his\r\nbachelor friends.\r\n\r\nAnna loved to work for men, for they could eat so much and with such\r\njoy. And when they were warm and full, they were content, and let her\r\ndo whatever she thought best. Not that Anna\'s conscience ever slept,\r\nfor neither with interference or without would she strain less to keep\r\non saving every cent and working every hour of the day. But truly she\r\nloved it best when she could scold. Now it was not only other girls\r\nand the colored man, and dogs, and cats, and horses and her parrot,\r\nbut her cheery master, jolly Dr. Shonjen, whom she could guide and\r\nconstantly rebuke to his own good.\r\n\r\nThe doctor really loved her scoldings as she loved his wickednesses\r\nand his merry joking ways.\r\n\r\nThese days were happy days with Anna.\r\n\r\nHer freakish humor now first showed itself, her sense of fun in\r\nthe queer ways that people had, that made her later find delight in\r\nbrutish servile Katy, in Sally\'s silly ways and in the badness of\r\nPeter and of Rags. She loved to make sport with the skeletons the\r\ndoctor had, to make them move and make strange noises till the negro\r\nboy shook in his shoes and his eyes rolled white in his agony of fear.\r\n\r\nThen Anna would tell these histories to her doctor. Her worn, thin,\r\nlined, determined face would form for itself new and humorous creases,\r\nand her pale blue eyes would kindle with humour and with joy as her\r\ndoctor burst into his hearty laugh. And the good Anna full of the\r\ncoquetry of pleasing would bridle with her angular, thin, spinster\r\nbody, straining her stories and herself to please.\r\n\r\nThese early days with jovial Dr. Shonjen were very happy days with the\r\ngood Anna.\r\n\r\nAll of Anna\'s spare hours in these early days she spent with her\r\nfriend, the widow Mrs. Lehntman. Mrs. Lehntman lived with her two\r\nchildren in a small house in the same part of the town as Dr. Shonjen.\r\nThe older of these two children was a girl named Julia and was now\r\nabout thirteen years of age. This Julia Lehntman was an unattractive\r\ngirl enough, harsh featured, dull and stubborn as had been her heavy\r\ngerman father. Mrs. Lehntman did not trouble much with her, but gave\r\nher always all she wanted that she had, and let the girl do as she\r\nliked. This was not from indifference or dislike on the part of Mrs.\r\nLehntman, it was just her usual way.\r\n\r\nHer second child was a boy, two years younger than his sister, a\r\nbright, pleasant, cheery fellow, who too, did what he liked with his\r\nmoney and his time. All this was so with Mrs. Lehntman because she\r\nhad so much in her head and in her house that clamoured for her\r\nconcentration and her time.\r\n\r\nThis slackness and neglect in the running of the house, and the\r\nindifference in this mother for the training of her young was very\r\nhard for our good Anna to endure. Of course she did her best to scold,\r\nto save for Mrs. Lehntman, and to put things in their place the way\r\nthey ought to be.\r\n\r\nEven in the early days when Anna was first won by the glamour of\r\nMrs. Lehntman\'s brilliancy and charm, she had been uneasy in Mrs.\r\nLehntman\'s house with a need of putting things to rights. Now that the\r\ntwo children growing up were of more importance in the house, and now\r\nthat long acquaintance had brushed the dazzle out of Anna\'s eyes, she\r\nbegan to struggle to make things go here as she thought was right.\r\n\r\nShe watched and scolded hard these days to make young Julia do the way\r\nshe should. Not that Julia Lehntman was pleasant in the good Anna\'s\r\nsight, but it must never be that a young girl growing up should have\r\nno one to make her learn to do things right.\r\n\r\nThe boy was easier to scold, for scoldings never sank in very deep,\r\nand indeed he liked them very well for they brought with them new\r\nthings to eat, and lively teasing, and good jokes.\r\n\r\nJulia, the girl, grew very sullen with it all, and very often won her\r\npoint, for after all Miss Annie was no relative of hers and had no\r\nbusiness coming there and making trouble all the time. Appealing to\r\nthe mother was no use. It was wonderful how Mrs. Lehntman could listen\r\nand not hear, could answer and yet not decide, could say and do what\r\nshe was asked and yet leave things as they were before.\r\n\r\nOne day it got almost too bad for even Anna\'s friendship to bear out.\r\n\r\n"Well, Julia, is your mamma out?" Anna asked, one Sunday summer\r\nafternoon, as she came into the Lehntman house.\r\n\r\nAnna looked very well this day. She was always careful in her dress\r\nand sparing of new clothes. She made herself always fulfill her own\r\nideal of how a girl should look when she took her Sundays out. Anna\r\nknew so well the kind of ugliness appropriate to each rank in life.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to see how when she bought things for Miss Wadsmith\r\nand later for her cherished Miss Mathilda and always entirely from her\r\nown taste and often as cheaply as she bought things for her friends\r\nor for herself, that on the one hand she chose the things having the\r\nright air for a member of the upper class, and for the others always\r\nthe things having the awkward ugliness that we call Dutch. She knew\r\nthe best thing in each kind, and she never in the course of her strong\r\nlife compromised her sense of what was the right thing for a girl to\r\nwear.\r\n\r\nOn this bright summer Sunday afternoon she came to the Lehntmans\',\r\nmuch dressed up in her new, brick red, silk waist trimmed with broad\r\nblack beaded braid, a dark cloth skirt and a new stiff, shiny, black\r\nstraw hat, trimmed with colored ribbons and a bird. She had on new\r\ngloves, and a feather boa about her neck.\r\n\r\nHer spare, thin, awkward body and her worn, pale yellow face though\r\nlit up now with the pleasant summer sun made a queer discord with the\r\nbrightness of her clothes.\r\n\r\nShe came to the Lehntman house, where she had not been for several\r\ndays, and opening the door that is always left unlatched in the houses\r\nof the lower middle class in the pleasant cities of the South, she\r\nfound Julia in the family sitting-room alone.\r\n\r\n"Well, Julia, where is your mamma?" Anna asked. "Ma is out but come\r\nin, Miss Annie, and look at our new brother." "What you talk so\r\nfoolish for Julia," said Anna sitting down. "I ain\'t talkin\' foolish,\r\nMiss Annie. Didn\'t you know mamma has just adopted a cute, nice little\r\nbaby boy?" "You talk so crazy, Julia, you ought to know better than\r\nto say such things." Julia turned sullen. "All right Miss Annie,\r\nyou don\'t need to believe what I say, but the little baby is in the\r\nkitchen and ma will tell you herself when she comes in."\r\n\r\nIt sounded most fantastic, but Julia had an air of truth and Mrs.\r\nLehntman was capable of doing stranger things. Anna was disturbed.\r\n"What you mean Julia," she said. "I don\'t mean nothin\' Miss Annie,\r\nyou don\'t believe the baby is in there, well you can go and see it for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nAnna went into the kitchen. A baby was there all right enough, and a\r\nlusty little boy he seemed. He was very tight asleep in a basket that\r\nstood in the corner by the open door.\r\n\r\n"You mean your mamma is just letting him stay here a little while,"\r\nAnna said to Julia who had followed her into the kitchen to see Miss\r\nAnnie get real mad. "No that ain\'t it Miss Annie. The mother was that\r\ngirl, Lily that came from Bishop\'s place out in the country, and she\r\ndon\'t want no children, and ma liked the little boy so much, she said\r\nshe\'d keep him here and adopt him for her own child."\r\n\r\nAnna, for once, was fairly dumb with astonishment and rage. The front\r\ndoor slammed.\r\n\r\n"There\'s ma now," cried Julia in an uneasy triumph, for she was not\r\nquite certain in her mind which side of the question she was on.\r\n"There\'s ma now, and you can ask her for yourself if I ain\'t told you\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman came into the kitchen where they were. She was bland,\r\nimpersonal and pleasant, as it was her wont to be. Still to-day,\r\nthrough this her usual manner that gave her such success in her\r\npractice as a midwife, there shone an uneasy consciousness of guilt,\r\nfor like all who had to do with the good Anna, Mrs. Lehntman dreaded\r\nher firm character, her vigorous judgments and the bitter fervour of\r\nher tongue.\r\n\r\nIt had been plain to see in the six years these women were together,\r\nhow Anna gradually had come to lead. Not really lead, of course, for\r\nMrs. Lehntman never could be led, she was so very devious in her ways;\r\nbut Anna had come to have direction whenever she could learn what Mrs.\r\nLehntman meant to do before the deed was done. Now it was hard to\r\ntell which would win out. Mrs. Lehntman had her unhearing mind and her\r\nhappy way of giving a pleasant well diffused attention, and then she\r\nhad it on her side that, after all, this thing was already done.\r\n\r\nAnna was, as usual, determined for the right. She was stiff and pale\r\nwith her anger and her fear, and nervous, and all a tremble as was her\r\nusual way when a bitter fight was near.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman was easy and pleasant as she came into the room. Anna\r\nwas stiff and silent and very white.\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t seen you for a long time, Anna," Mrs. Lehntman cordially\r\nbegan. "I was just gettin\' worried thinking you was sick. My! but it\'s\r\na hot day to-day. Come into the sittin\'-room, Anna, and Julia will\r\nmake us some ice tea."\r\n\r\nAnna followed Mrs. Lehntman into the other room in a stiff silence,\r\nand when there she did not, as invited, take a chair.\r\n\r\nAs always with Anna when a thing had to come it came very short and\r\nsharp. She found it hard to breathe just now, and every word came with\r\na jerk.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lehntman, it ain\'t true what Julia said about your taking that\r\nLily\'s boy to keep. I told Julia when she told me she was crazy to\r\ntalk so."\r\n\r\nAnna\'s real excitements stopped her breath, and made her words come\r\nsharp and with a jerk. Mrs. Lehntman\'s feelings spread her breath, and\r\nmade her words come slow, but more pleasant and more easy even than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Why Anna," she began, "don\'t you see Lily couldn\'t keep her boy for\r\nshe is working at the Bishops\' now, and he is such a cute dear little\r\nchap, and you know how fond I am of little fellers, and I thought it\r\nwould be nice for Julia and for Willie to have a little brother. You\r\nknow Julia always loves to play with babies, and I have to be away\r\nso much, and Willie he is running in the streets every minute all the\r\ntime, and you see a baby would be sort of nice company for Julia,\r\nand you know you are always saying Anna, Julia should not be on the\r\nstreets so much and the baby will be so good to keep her in."\r\n\r\nAnna was every minute paler with indignation and with heat.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lehntman, I don\'t see what business it is for you to take\r\nanother baby for your own, when you can\'t do what\'s right by Julia and\r\nWillie you got here already. There\'s Julia, nobody tells her a thing\r\nwhen I ain\'t here, and who is going to tell her now how to do things\r\nfor that baby? She ain\'t got no sense what\'s the right way to do with\r\nchildren, and you out all the time, and you ain\'t got no time for your\r\nown neither, and now you want to be takin\' up with strangers. I know\r\nyou was careless, Mrs. Lehntman, but I didn\'t think that you could\r\ndo this so. No, Mrs. Lehntman, it ain\'t your duty to take up with no\r\nothers, when you got two children of your own, that got to get along\r\njust any way they can, and you know you ain\'t got any too much money\r\nall the time, and you are all so careless here and spend it all the\r\ntime, and Julia and Willie growin\' big. It ain\'t right, Mrs. Lehntman,\r\nto do so."\r\n\r\nThis was as bad as it could be. Anna had never spoken her mind so to\r\nher friend before. Now it was too harsh for Mrs. Lehntman to allow\r\nherself to really hear. If she really took the meaning in these words\r\nshe could never ask Anna to come into her house again, and she\r\nliked Anna very well, and was used to depend on her savings and her\r\nstrength. And then too Mrs. Lehntman could not really take in harsh\r\nideas. She was too well diffused to catch the feel of any sharp firm\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nNow she managed to understand all this in a way that made it easy for\r\nher to say, "Why, Anna, I think you feel too bad about seeing what the\r\nchildren are doing every minute in the day. Julia and Willie are real\r\ngood, and they play with all the nicest children in the square. If\r\nyou had some, all your own, Anna, you\'d see it don\'t do no harm to let\r\nthem do a little as they like, and Julia likes this baby so, and sweet\r\ndear little boy, it would be so kind of bad to send him to a \'sylum\r\nnow, you know it would Anna, when you like children so yourself,\r\nand are so good to my Willie all the time. No indeed Anna, it\'s easy\r\nenough to say I should send this poor, cute little boy to a \'sylum\r\nwhen I could keep him here so nice, but you know Anna, you wouldn\'t\r\nlike to do it yourself, now you really know you wouldn\'t, Anna, though\r\nyou talk to me so hard.--My, it\'s hot to-day, what you doin\' with that\r\nice tea in there Julia, when Miss Annie is waiting all this time for\r\nher drink?"\r\n\r\nJulia brought in the ice tea. She was so excited with the talk she had\r\nbeen hearing from the kitchen, that she slopped it on the plate out of\r\nthe glasses a good deal. But she was safe, for Anna felt this trouble\r\nso deep down that she did not even see those awkward, bony hands,\r\nadorned today with a new ring, those stupid, foolish hands that always\r\ndid things the wrong way.\r\n\r\n"Here Miss Annie," Julia said, "Here, Miss Annie, is your glass of\r\ntea, I know you like it good and strong."\r\n\r\n"No, Julia, I don\'t want no ice tea here. Your mamma ain\'t able to\r\nafford now using her money upon ice tea for her friends. It ain\'t\r\nright she should now any more. I go out now to see Mrs. Drehten. She\r\ndoes all she can, and she is sick now working so hard taking care of\r\nher own children. I go there now. Good by Mrs. Lehntman, I hope you\r\ndon\'t get no bad luck doin\' what it ain\'t right for you to do."\r\n\r\n"My, Miss Annie is real mad now," Julia said, as the house shook, as\r\nthe good Anna shut the outside door with a concentrated shattering\r\nslam.\r\n\r\nIt was some months now that Anna had been intimate with Mrs. Drehten.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drehten had had a tumor and had come to Dr. Shonjen to be\r\ntreated. During the course of her visits there, she and Anna had\r\nlearned to like each other very well. There was no fever in this\r\nfriendship, it was just the interchange of two hard working, worrying\r\nwomen, the one large and motherly, with the pleasant, patient, soft,\r\nworn, tolerant face, that comes with a german husband to obey, and\r\nseven solid girls and boys to bear and rear, and the other was our\r\ngood Anna with her spinster body, her firm jaw, her humorous, light,\r\nclean eyes and her lined, worn, thin, pale yellow face.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drehten lived a patient, homely, hard-working life. Her husband\r\nan honest, decent man enough, was a brewer, and somewhat given to over\r\ndrinking, and so he was often surly and stingy and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThe family of seven children was made up of four stalwart, cheery,\r\nfilial sons, and three hard working obedient simple daughters.\r\n\r\nIt was a family life the good Anna very much approved and also she\r\nwas much liked by them all. With a german woman\'s feeling for the\r\nmasterhood in men, she was docile to the surly father and rarely\r\nrubbed him the wrong way. To the large, worn, patient, sickly mother\r\nshe was a sympathetic listener, wise in council and most efficient in\r\nher help. The young ones too, liked her very well. The sons teased her\r\nall the time and roared with boisterous pleasure when she gave them\r\nback sharp hits. The girls were all so good that her scoldings here\r\nwere only in the shape of good advice, sweetened with new trimmings\r\nfor their hats, and ribbons, and sometimes on their birthdays, bits of\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Anna came for comfort after her grievous stroke at\r\nher friend the widow, Mrs. Lehntman. Not that Anna would tell Mrs.\r\nDrehten of this trouble. She could never lay bare the wound that came\r\nto her through this idealised affection. Her affair with Mrs. Lehntman\r\nwas too sacred and too grievous ever to be told. But here in this\r\nlarge household, in busy movement and variety in strife, she could\r\nsilence the uneasiness and pain of her own wound.\r\n\r\nThe Drehtens lived out in the country in one of the wooden, ugly\r\nhouses that lie in groups outside of our large cities.\r\n\r\nThe father and the sons all had their work here making beer, and the\r\nmother and her girls scoured and sewed and cooked.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays they were all washed very clean, and smelling of kitchen\r\nsoap. The sons, in their Sunday clothes, loafed around the house or in\r\nthe village, and on special days went on picnics with their girls. The\r\ndaughters in their awkward, colored finery went to church most of the\r\nday and then walking with their friends.\r\n\r\nThey always came together for their supper, where Anna always was most\r\nwelcome, the jolly Sunday evening supper that german people love.\r\nHere Anna and the boys gave it to each other in sharp hits and hearty\r\nboisterous laughter, the girls made things for them to eat, and waited\r\non them all, the mother loved all her children all the time, and\r\nthe father joined in with his occasional unpleasant word that made a\r\nbitter feeling but which they had all learned to pass as if it were\r\nnot said.\r\n\r\nIt was to the comfort of this house that Anna came that Sunday summer\r\nafternoon, after she had left Mrs. Lehntman and her careless ways.\r\n\r\nThe Drehten house was open all about. No one was there but Mrs.\r\nDrehten resting in her rocking chair, out in the pleasant, scented,\r\nsummer air.\r\n\r\nAnna had had a hot walk from the cars.\r\n\r\nShe went into the kitchen for a cooling drink, and then came out and\r\nsat down on the steps near Mrs. Drehten.\r\n\r\nAnna\'s anger had changed. A sadness had come to her. Now with the\r\npatient, friendly, gentle mother talk of Mrs. Drehten, this sadness\r\nchanged to resignation and to rest.\r\n\r\nAs the evening came on the young ones dropped in one by one. Soon the\r\nmerry Sunday evening supper was begun.\r\n\r\nIt had not been all comfort for our Anna, these months of knowing\r\nMrs. Drehten. It had made trouble for her with the family of her half\r\nbrother, the fat baker.\r\n\r\nHer half brother, the fat baker, was a queer kind of a man. He was a\r\nhuge, unwieldy creature, all puffed out all over, and no longer able\r\nto walk much, with his enormous body and the big, swollen, bursted\r\nveins in his great legs. He did not try to walk much now. He sat\r\naround his place, leaning on his great thick stick, and watching his\r\nworkmen at their work.\r\n\r\nOn holidays, and sometimes of a Sunday, he went out in his bakery\r\nwagon. He went then to each customer he had and gave them each a\r\nlarge, sweet, raisined loaf of caky bread. At every house with many\r\ngroans and gasps he would descend his heavy weight out of the wagon,\r\nhis good featured, black haired, flat, good natured face shining with\r\noily perspiration, with pride in labor and with generous kindness.\r\nUp each stoop he hobbled with the help of his big stick, and into the\r\nnearest chair in the kitchen or in the parlour, as the fashion of the\r\nhouse demanded, and there he sat and puffed, and then presented to the\r\nmistress or the cook the raisined german loaf his boy supplied him.\r\n\r\nAnna had never been a customer of his. She had always lived in another\r\npart of the town, but he never left her out in these bakery progresses\r\nof his, and always with his own hand he gave her her festive loaf.\r\n\r\nAnna liked her half brother well enough. She never knew him really\r\nwell, for he rarely talked at all and least of all to women, but\r\nhe seemed to her, honest, and good and kind, and he never tried to\r\ninterfere in Anna\'s ways. And then Anna liked the loaves of raisined\r\nbread, for in the summer she and the second girl could live on them,\r\nand not be buying bread with the household money all the time.\r\n\r\nBut things were not so simple with our Anna, with the other members of\r\nher half brother\'s house.\r\n\r\nHer half brother\'s family was made up of himself, his wife, and their\r\ntwo daughters.\r\n\r\nAnna never liked her brother\'s wife.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the two daughters was named after her aunt Anna.\r\n\r\nAnna never liked her half brother\'s wife. This woman had been very\r\ngood to Anna, never interfering in her ways, always glad to see her\r\nand to make her visits pleasant, but she had not found favour in our\r\ngood Anna\'s sight.\r\n\r\nAnna had too, no real affection for her nieces. She never scolded\r\nthem or tried to guide them for their good. Anna never criticised or\r\ninterfered in the running of her half brother\'s house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Federner was a good looking, prosperous woman, a little harsh and\r\ncold within her soul perhaps, but trying always to be pleasant, good\r\nand kind. Her daughters were well trained, quiet, obedient, well\r\ndressed girls, and yet our good Anna loved them not, nor their mother,\r\nnor any of their ways.\r\n\r\nIt was in this house that Anna had first met her friend, the widow,\r\nMrs. Lehntman.\r\n\r\nThe Federners had never seemed to feel it wrong in Anna, her devotion\r\nto this friend and her care of her and of her children. Mrs. Lehntman\r\nand Anna and her feelings were all somehow too big for their attack.\r\nBut Mrs. Federner had the mind and tongue that blacken things. Not\r\nreally to blacken black, of course, but just to roughen and to rub on\r\na little smut. She could somehow make even the face of the Almighty\r\nseem pimply and a little coarse, and so she always did this with her\r\nfriends, though not with the intent to interfere.\r\n\r\nThis was really true with Mrs. Lehntman that Mrs. Federner did not\r\nmean to interfere, but Anna\'s friendship with the Drehtens was a very\r\ndifferent matter.\r\n\r\nWhy should Mrs. Drehten, that poor common working wife of a man who\r\nworked for others in a brewery and who always drank too much, and was\r\nnot like a thrifty, decent german man, why should that Mrs. Drehten\r\nand her ugly, awkward daughters be getting presents from her husband\'s\r\nsister all the time, and her husband always so good to Anna, and one\r\nof the girls having her name too, and those Drehtens all strangers to\r\nher and never going to come to any good? It was not right for Anna to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nMrs. Federner knew better than to say such things straight out to her\r\nhusband\'s fiery, stubborn sister, but she lost no chance to let Anna\r\nfeel and see what they all thought.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to blacken all the Drehtens, their poverty, the husband\'s\r\ndrinking, the four big sons carrying on and always lazy, the awkward,\r\nugly daughters dressing up with Anna\'s help and trying to look so\r\nfine, and the poor, weak, hard-working sickly mother, so easy to\r\ndegrade with large dosings of contemptuous pity.\r\n\r\nAnna could not do much with these attacks for Mrs. Federner always\r\nended with, "And you so good to them Anna all the time. I don\'t see\r\nhow they could get along at all if you didn\'t help them all the time,\r\nbut you are so good Anna, and got such a feeling heart, just like your\r\nbrother, that you give anything away you got to anybody that will ask\r\nyou for it, and that\'s shameless enough to take it when they ain\'t no\r\nrelatives of yours. Poor Mrs. Drehten, she is a good woman. Poor thing\r\nit must be awful hard for her to have to take things from strangers\r\nall the time, and her husband spending it on drink. I was saying to\r\nMrs. Lehntman, Anna, only yesterday, how I never was so sorry for any\r\none as Mrs. Drehten, and how good it was for you to help them all the\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nAll this meant a gold watch and chain to her god daughter for her\r\nbirthday, the next month, and a new silk umbrella for the elder\r\nsister. Poor Anna, and she did not love them very much, these\r\nrelatives of hers, and they were the only kin she had.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman never joined in, in these attacks. Mrs. Lehntman was\r\ndiffuse and careless in her ways, but she never worked such things for\r\nher own ends, and she was too sure of Anna to be jealous of her other\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAll this time Anna was leading her happy life with Dr. Shonjen.\r\nShe had every day her busy time. She cooked and saved and sewed and\r\nscrubbed and scolded. And every night she had her happy time, in\r\nseeing her Doctor like the fine things she bought so cheap and cooked\r\nso good for him to eat. And then he would listen and laugh so loud, as\r\nshe told him stories of what had happened on that day.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, too, liked it better all the time and several times in\r\nthese five years he had of his own motion raised her wages.\r\n\r\nAnna was content with what she had and grateful for all her doctor did\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nSo Anna\'s serving and her giving life went on, each with its varied\r\npleasures and its pains.\r\n\r\nThe adopting of the little boy did not put an end to Anna\'s friendship\r\nfor the widow Mrs. Lehntman. Neither the good Anna nor the careless\r\nMrs. Lehntman would give each other up excepting for the gravest\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman was the only romance Anna ever knew. A certain magnetic\r\nbrilliancy in person and in manner made Mrs. Lehntman a woman other\r\nwomen loved. Then, too, she was generous and good and honest, though\r\nshe was so careless always in her ways. And then she trusted Anna and\r\nliked her better than any of her other friends, and Anna always felt\r\nthis very much.\r\n\r\nNo, Anna could not give up Mrs. Lehntman, and soon she was busier than\r\nbefore making Julia do things right for little Johnny.\r\n\r\nAnd now new schemes were working strong in Mrs. Lehntman\'s head, and\r\nAnna must listen to her plans and help her make them work.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman always loved best in her work to deliver young girls who\r\nwere in trouble. She would keep these in her house until they could go\r\nto their homes or to their work, and slowly pay her back the money for\r\ntheir care.\r\n\r\nAnna had always helped her friend to do this thing, for like all the\r\ngood women of the decent poor, she felt it hard that girls should\r\nnot be helped, not girls that were really bad of course, these she\r\ncondemned and hated in her heart and with her tongue, but honest,\r\ndecent, good, hard working, foolish girls who were in trouble.\r\n\r\nFor such as these Anna always liked to give her money and her\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nNow Mrs. Lehntman thought that it would pay to take a big house for\r\nherself to take in girls and to do everything in a big way.\r\n\r\nAnna did not like this plan.\r\n\r\nAnna was never daring in her ways. Save and you will have the money\r\nyou have saved, was all that she could know.\r\n\r\nNot that the good Anna had it so.\r\n\r\nShe saved and saved and always saved, and then here and there, to this\r\nfriend and to that, to one in her trouble and to the other in her joy,\r\nin sickness, death, and weddings, or to make young people happy, it\r\nalways went, the hard earned money she had saved.\r\n\r\nAnna could not clearly see how Mrs. Lehntman could make a big house\r\npay. In the small house where she had these girls, it did not pay, and\r\nin a big house there was so much more that she would spend.\r\n\r\nSuch things were hard for the good Anna to very clearly see. One day\r\nshe came into the Lehntman house. "Anna," Mrs. Lehntman said, "you\r\nknow that nice big house on the next corner that we saw to rent. I\r\ntook it for a year just yesterday. I paid a little down you know so I\r\ncould have it sure all right and now you fix it up just like you want.\r\nI let you do just what you like with it."\r\n\r\nAnna knew that it was now too late. However, "But Mrs. Lehntman you\r\nsaid you would not take another house, you said so just last week. Oh,\r\nMrs. Lehntman I didn\'t think that you would do this so!"\r\n\r\nAnna knew so well it was too late.\r\n\r\n"I know, Anna, but it was such a good house, just right you know and\r\nsomeone else was there to see, and you know you said it suited very\r\nwell, and if I didn\'t take it the others said they would, and I wanted\r\nto ask you only there wasn\'t time, and really Anna, I don\'t need much\r\nhelp, it will go so well I know. I just need a little to begin and\r\nto fix up with and that\'s all Anna that I need, and I know it will go\r\nawful well. You wait Anna and you\'ll see, and I let you fix it up just\r\nlike you want, and you will make it look so nice, you got such sense\r\nin all these things. It will be a good place. You see Anna if I ain\'t\r\nright in what I say."\r\n\r\nOf course Anna gave the money for this thing though she could not\r\nbelieve that it was best. No, it was very bad. Mrs. Lehntman could\r\nnever make it pay and it would cost so much to keep. But what could\r\nour poor Anna do? Remember Mrs. Lehntman was the only romance Anna\r\never knew.\r\n\r\nAnna\'s strength in her control of what was done in Mrs. Lehntman\'s\r\nhouse, was not now what it had been before that Lily\'s little Johnny\r\ncame. That thing had been for Anna a defeat. There had been no\r\nfighting to a finish but Mrs. Lehntman had very surely won.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman needed Anna just as much as Anna needed Mrs. Lehntman,\r\nbut Mrs. Lehntman was more ready to risk Anna\'s loss, and so the good\r\nAnna grew always weaker in her power to control.\r\n\r\nIn friendship, power always has its downward curve. One\'s strength to\r\nmanage rises always higher until there comes a time one does not win,\r\nand though one may not really lose, still from the time that victory\r\nis not sure, one\'s power slowly ceases to be strong. It is only in a\r\nclose tie such as marriage, that influence can mount and grow always\r\nstronger with the years and never meet with a decline. It can only\r\nhappen so when there is no way to escape.\r\n\r\nFriendship goes by favour. There is always danger of a break or of a\r\nstronger power coming in between. Influence can only be a steady march\r\nwhen one can surely never break away.\r\n\r\nAnna wanted Mrs. Lehntman very much and Mrs. Lehntman needed Anna, but\r\nthere were always other ways to do and if Anna had once given up she\r\nmight do so again, so why should Mrs. Lehntman have real fear?\r\n\r\nNo, while the good Anna did not come to open fight she had been\r\nstronger. Now Mrs. Lehntman could always hold out longer. She knew\r\ntoo, that Anna had a feeling heart. Anna could never stop doing all\r\nshe could for any one that really needed help. Poor Anna had no power\r\nto say no.\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, Mrs. Lehntman was the only romance Anna ever knew.\r\nRomance is the ideal in one\'s life and it is very lonely living with\r\nit lost.\r\n\r\nSo the good Anna gave all her savings for this place, although she\r\nknew that this was not the right way for her friend to do.\r\n\r\nFor some time now they were all very busy fixing up the house. It\r\nswallowed all Anna\'s savings fixing up this house, for when Anna once\r\nbegan to make it nice, she could not leave it be until it was as good\r\nas for the purpose it should be.\r\n\r\nSomehow it was Anna now that really took the interest in the house.\r\nMrs. Lehntman, now the thing was done seemed very lifeless, without\r\ninterest in the house, uneasy in her mind and restless in her ways,\r\nand more diffuse even than before in her attention. She was good and\r\nkind to all the people in her house, and let them do whatever they\r\nthought best.\r\n\r\nAnna did not fail to see that Mrs. Lehntman had something on her mind\r\nthat was all new. What was it that disturbed Mrs. Lehntman so? She\r\nkept on saying it was all in Anna\'s head. She had no trouble now at\r\nall. Everybody was so good and it was all so nice in the new house.\r\nBut surely there was something here that was all wrong.\r\n\r\nAnna heard a good deal of all this from her half brother\'s wife, the\r\nhard speaking Mrs. Federner.\r\n\r\nThrough the fog of dust and work and furnishing in the new house, and\r\nthrough the disturbed mind of Mrs. Lehntman, and with the dark hints\r\nof Mrs. Federner, there loomed up to Anna\'s sight a man, a new doctor\r\nthat Mrs. Lehntman knew.\r\n\r\nAnna had never met the man but she heard of him very often now. Not\r\nfrom her friend, the widow Mrs. Lehntman. Anna knew that Mrs. Lehntman\r\nmade of him a mystery that Anna had not the strength just then to\r\nvigorously break down.\r\n\r\nMrs. Federner gave always dark suggestions and unpleasant hints. Even\r\ngood Mrs. Drehten talked of it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman never spoke of the new doctor more than she could help.\r\nThis was most mysterious and unpleasant and very hard for our good\r\nAnna to endure.\r\n\r\nAnna\'s troubles came all of them at once.\r\n\r\nHere in Mrs. Lehntman\'s house loomed up dismal and forbidding, a\r\nmysterious, perhaps an evil man. In Dr. Shonjen\'s house were beginning\r\nsigns of interest in the doctor in a woman.\r\n\r\nThis, too, Mrs. Federner often told to the poor Anna. The doctor\r\nsurely would be married soon, he liked so much now to go to Mr.\r\nWeingartner\'s house where there was a daughter who loved Doctor,\r\neverybody knew.\r\n\r\nIn these days the living room in her half brother\'s house was Anna\'s\r\ntorture chamber. And worst of all there was so much reason for her\r\nhalf sister\'s words. The Doctor certainly did look like marriage and\r\nMrs. Lehntman acted very queer.\r\n\r\nPoor Anna. Dark were these days and much she had to suffer.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor\'s trouble came to a head the first. It was true Doctor was\r\nengaged and to be married soon. He told Anna so himself.\r\n\r\nWhat was the good Anna now to do? Dr. Shonjen wanted her of course to\r\nstay. Anna was so sad with all these troubles. She knew here in the\r\nDoctor\'s house it would be bad when he was married, but she had not\r\nthe strength now to be firm and go away. She said at last that she\r\nwould try and stay.\r\n\r\nDoctor got married now very soon. Anna made the house all beautiful\r\nand clean and she really hoped that she might stay. But this was not\r\nfor long.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shonjen was a proud, unpleasant woman. She wanted constant\r\nservice and attention and never even a thank you to a servant. Soon\r\nall Doctor\'s old people went away. Anna went to Doctor and explained.\r\nShe told him what all the servants thought of his new wife. Anna bade\r\nhim a sad farewell and went away.\r\n\r\nAnna was now most uncertain what to do. She could go to Curden to her\r\nMiss Mary Wadsmith who always wrote how much she needed Anna, but Anna\r\nstill dreaded Miss Jane\'s interfering ways. Then too, she could not\r\nyet go away from Bridgepoint and from Mrs. Lehntman, unpleasant as it\r\nalways was now over there.\r\n\r\nThrough one of Doctor\'s friends Anna heard of Miss Mathilda. Anna was\r\nvery doubtful about working for a Miss Mathilda. She did not think it\r\nwould be good working for a woman anymore. She had found it very good\r\nwith Miss Mary but she did not think that many women would be so.\r\n\r\nMost women were interfering in their ways.\r\n\r\nAnna heard that Miss Mathilda was a great big woman, not so big\r\nperhaps as her Miss Mary, still she was big, and the good Anna liked\r\nthem better so. She did not like them thin and small and active and\r\nalways looking in and always prying.\r\n\r\nAnna could not make up her mind what was the best thing now for her\r\nto do. She could sew and this way make a living, but she did not like\r\nsuch business very well.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman urged the place with Miss Mathilda. She was sure Anna\r\nwould find it better so. The good Anna did not know.\r\n\r\n"Well Anna," Mrs. Lehntman said, "I tell you what we do. I go with you\r\nto that woman that tells fortunes, perhaps she tell us something that\r\nwill show us what is the best way for you now to do."\r\n\r\nIt was very bad to go to a woman who tells fortunes. Anna was of\r\nstrong South German Catholic religion and the german priests in the\r\nchurches always said that it was very bad to do things so. But what\r\nelse now could the good Anna do? She was so mixed and bothered in her\r\nmind, and troubled with this life that was all wrong, though she did\r\ntry so hard to do the best she knew. "All right, Mrs. Lehntman," Anna\r\nsaid at last, "I think I go there now with you."\r\n\r\nThis woman who told fortunes was a medium. She had a house in the\r\nlower quarter of the town. Mrs. Lehntman and the good Anna went to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe medium opened the door for them herself. She was a loose made,\r\ndusty, dowdy woman with a persuading, conscious and embracing manner\r\nand very greasy hair.\r\n\r\nThe woman let them come into the house.\r\n\r\nThe street door opened straight into the parlor, as is the way in the\r\nsmall houses of the south. The parlor had a thick and flowered carpet\r\non the floor. The room was full of dirty things all made by hand. Some\r\nhung upon the wall, some were on the seats and over backs of chairs\r\nand some on tables and on those what-nots that poor people love. And\r\neverywhere were little things that break. Many of these little things\r\nwere broken and the place was stuffy and not clean.\r\n\r\nNo medium uses her parlor for her work. It is always in her eating\r\nroom that she has her trances.\r\n\r\nThe eating room in all these houses is the living room in winter. It\r\nhas a round table in the centre covered with a decorated woolen cloth,\r\nthat has soaked in the grease of many dinners, for though it should be\r\nalways taken off, it is easier to spread the cloth upon it than change\r\nit for the blanket deadener that one owns. The upholstered chairs are\r\ndark and worn, and dirty. The carpet has grown dingy with the food\r\nthat\'s fallen from the table, the dirt that\'s scraped from off the\r\nshoes, and the dust that settles with the ages. The sombre greenish\r\ncolored paper on the walls has been smoked a dismal dirty grey, and\r\nall pervading is the smell of soup made out of onions and fat chunks\r\nof meat.\r\n\r\nThe medium brought Mrs. Lehntman and our Anna into this eating room,\r\nafter she had found out what it was they wanted. They all three sat\r\naround the table and then the medium went into her trance.\r\n\r\nThe medium first closed her eyes and then they opened very wide and\r\nlifeless. She took a number of deep breaths, choked several times and\r\nswallowed very hard. She waved her hand back every now and then, and\r\nshe began to speak in a monotonous slow, even tone.\r\n\r\n"I see--I see--don\'t crowd so on me,--I see--I see--too many\r\nforms--don\'t crowd so on me--I see--I see--you are thinking of\r\nsomething--you don\'t know whether you want to do it now. I see--I\r\nsee--don\'t crowd so on me--I see--I see--you are not sure,--I see--I\r\nsee--a house with trees around it,--it is dark--it is evening--I\r\nsee--I see--you go in the house--I see--I see you come out--it will\r\nbe all right--you go and do it--do what you are not certain about--it\r\nwill come out all right--it is best and you should do it now."\r\n\r\nShe stopped, she made deep gulps, her eyes rolled back into her head,\r\nshe swallowed hard and then she was her former dingy and bland self\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Did you get what you wanted that the spirit should tell you?" the\r\nwoman asked. Mrs. Lehntman answered yes, it was just what her\r\nfriend had wanted so bad to know. Anna was uneasy in this house with\r\nsuperstition, with fear of her good priest, and with disgust at all\r\nthe dirt and grease, but she was most content for now she knew what it\r\nwas best for her to do.\r\n\r\nAnna paid the woman for her work and then they came away.\r\n\r\n"There Anna didn\'t I tell you how it would all be? You see the spirit\r\nsays so too. You must take the place with Miss Mathilda, that is what\r\nI told you was the best thing for you to do. We go out and see her\r\nwhere she lives to-night. Ain\'t you glad, Anna, that I took you to\r\nthis place, so you know now what you will do?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman and Anna went that evening to see Miss Mathilda. Miss\r\nMathilda was staying with a friend who lived in a house that did have\r\ntrees about. Miss Mathilda was not there herself to talk with Anna.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been that it was evening, and so dark, and that this\r\nhouse had trees all round about, and that Anna found herself going in\r\nand coming out just as the woman that day said that she would do, had\r\nit not all been just as the medium said, the good Anna would never\r\nhave taken the place with Miss Mathilda.\r\n\r\nAnna did not see Miss Mathilda and she did not like the friend who\r\nacted in her place.\r\n\r\nThis friend was a dark, sweet, gentle little mother woman, very easy\r\nto be pleased in her own work and very good to servants, but she felt\r\nthat acting for her young friend, the careless Miss Mathilda, she must\r\nbe very careful to examine well and see that all was right and that\r\nAnna would surely do the best she knew. She asked Anna all about her\r\nways and her intentions and how much she would spend, and how often\r\nshe went out and whether she could wash and cook and sew.\r\n\r\nThe good Anna set her teeth fast to endure and would hardly answer\r\nanything at all. Mrs. Lehntman made it all go fairly well.\r\n\r\nThe good Anna was all worked up with her resentment, and Miss\r\nMathilda\'s friend did not think that she would do.\r\n\r\nHowever, Miss Mathilda was willing to begin and as for Anna, she knew\r\nthat the medium said it must be so. Mrs. Lehntman, too, was sure, and\r\nsaid she knew that this was the best thing for Anna now to do. So Anna\r\nsent word at last to Miss Mathilda, that if she wanted her, she would\r\ntry if it would do.\r\n\r\nSo Anna began a new life taking care of Miss Mathilda.\r\n\r\nAnna fixed up the little red brick house where Miss Mathilda was going\r\nto live and made it very pleasant, clean and nice. She brought over\r\nher dog, Baby, and her parrot. She hired Lizzie for a second girl to\r\nbe with her and soon they were all content. All except the parrot, for\r\nMiss Mathilda did not like its scream. Baby was all right but not the\r\nparrot. But then Anna never really loved the parrot, and so she gave\r\nit to the Drehten girls to keep.\r\n\r\nBefore Anna could really rest content with Miss Mathilda, she had to\r\ntell her good german priest what it was that she had done, and how\r\nvery bad it was that she had been and how she would never do so again.\r\n\r\nAnna really did believe with all her might. It was her fortune never\r\nto live with people who had any faith, but then that never worried\r\nAnna. She prayed for them always as she should, and she was very sure\r\nthat they were good. The doctor loved to tease her with his doubts and\r\nMiss Mathilda liked to do so too, but with the tolerant spirit of her\r\nchurch, Anna never thought that such things were bad for them to do.\r\n\r\nAnna found it hard to always know just why it was that things went\r\nwrong. Sometimes her glasses broke and then she knew that she had not\r\ndone her duty by the church, just in the way that she should do.\r\n\r\nSometimes she was so hard at work that she would not go to mass.\r\nSomething always happened then. Anna\'s temper grew irritable and her\r\nways uncertain and distraught. Everybody suffered and then her glasses\r\nbroke. That was always very bad because they cost so much to fix.\r\nStill in a way it always ended Anna\'s troubles, because she knew then\r\nthat all this was because she had been bad. As long as she could scold\r\nit might be just the bad ways of all the thoughtless careless world,\r\nbut when her glasses broke that made it clear. That meant that it was\r\nshe herself who had been bad.\r\n\r\nNo, it was no use for Anna not to do the way she should, for things\r\nalways then went wrong and finally cost money to make whole, and this\r\nwas the hardest thing for the good Anna to endure.\r\n\r\nAnna almost always did her duty. She made confession and her mission\r\nwhenever it was right. Of course she did not tell the father when\r\nshe deceived people for their good, or when she wanted them to give\r\nsomething for a little less.\r\n\r\nWhen Anna told such histories to her doctor and later to her cherished\r\nMiss Mathilda, her eyes were always full of humor and enjoyment as she\r\nexplained that she had said it so, and now she would not have to tell\r\nthe father for she had not really made a sin.\r\n\r\nBut going to a fortune teller Anna knew was really bad. That had to be\r\ntold to the father just as it was and penance had then to be done.\r\n\r\nAnna did this and now her new life was well begun, making Miss\r\nMathilda and the rest do just the way they should.\r\n\r\nYes, taking care of Miss Mathilda were the happiest days of all the\r\ngood Anna\'s strong hard working life.\r\n\r\nWith Miss Mathilda Anna did it all. The clothes, the house, the hats,\r\nwhat she should wear and when and what was always best for her to do.\r\nThere was nothing Miss Mathilda would not let Anna manage, and only be\r\ntoo glad if she would do.\r\n\r\nAnna scolded and cooked and sewed and saved so well, that Miss\r\nMathilda had so much to spend, that it kept Anna still busier scolding\r\nall the time about the things she bought, that made so much work for\r\nAnna and the other girl to do. But for all the scolding, Anna was\r\nproud almost to bursting of her cherished Miss Mathilda with all her\r\nknowledge and her great possessions, and the good Anna was always\r\ntelling of it all to everybody that she knew.\r\n\r\nYes these were the happiest days of all her life with Anna, even\r\nthough with her friends there were great sorrows. But these sorrows\r\ndid not hurt the good Anna now, as they had done in the years that\r\nwent before.\r\n\r\nMiss Mathilda was not a romance in the good Anna\'s life, but Anna gave\r\nher so much strong affection that it almost filled her life as full.\r\n\r\nIt was well for the good Anna that her life with Miss Mathilda was so\r\nhappy, for now in these days, Mrs. Lehntman went altogether bad. The\r\ndoctor she had learned to know, was too certainly an evil as well as\r\na mysterious man, and he had power over the widow and midwife, Mrs.\r\nLehntman.\r\n\r\nAnna never saw Mrs. Lehntman at all now any more.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman had borrowed some more money and had given Anna a note\r\nthen for it all, and after that Anna never saw her any more. Anna now\r\nstopped altogether going to the Lehntmans\'. Julia, the tall, gawky,\r\ngood, blonde, stupid daughter, came often to see Anna, but she could\r\ntell little of her mother.\r\n\r\nIt certainly did look very much as if Mrs. Lehntman had now gone\r\naltogether bad. This was a great grief to the good Anna, but not so\r\ngreat a grief as it would have been had not Miss Mathilda meant so\r\nmuch to her now.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman went from bad to worse. The doctor, the mysterious and\r\nevil man, got into trouble doing things that were not right to do.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman was mixed up in this affair.\r\n\r\nIt was just as bad as it could be, but they managed, both the doctor\r\nand Mrs. Lehntman, finally to come out safe.\r\n\r\nEverybody was so sorry about Mrs. Lehntman. She had been really a good\r\nwoman before she met this doctor, and even now she certainly had not\r\nbeen really bad.\r\n\r\nFor several years now Anna never even saw her friend.\r\n\r\nBut Anna always found new people to befriend, people who, in the\r\nkindly fashion of the poor, used up her savings and then gave promises\r\nin place of payments. Anna never really thought that these people\r\nwould be good, but when they did not do the way they should, and when\r\nthey did not pay her back the money she had loaned, and never seemed\r\nthe better for her care, then Anna would grow bitter with the world.\r\n\r\nNo, none of them had any sense of what was the right way for them to\r\ndo. So Anna would repeat in her despair.\r\n\r\nThe poor are generous with their things. They give always what they\r\nhave, but with them to give or to receive brings with it no feeling\r\nthat they owe the giver for the gift.\r\n\r\nEven a thrifty german Anna was ready to give all that she had saved,\r\nand so not be sure that she would have enough to take care of herself\r\nif she fell sick, or for old age, when she could not work. Save and\r\nyou will have the money you have saved was true only for the day of\r\nsaving, even for a thrifty german Anna. There was no certain way to\r\nhave it for old age, for the taking care of what is saved can never be\r\nrelied on, for it must always be in strangers\' hands in a bank or in\r\ninvestments by a friend.\r\n\r\nAnd so when any day one might need life and help from others of the\r\nworking poor, there was no way a woman who had a little saved could\r\nsay them no.\r\n\r\nSo the good Anna gave her all to friends and strangers, to children,\r\ndogs and cats, to anything that asked or seemed to need her care.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that Anna came to help the barber and his wife who\r\nlived around the corner, and who somehow could never make ends meet.\r\nThey worked hard, were thrifty, had no vices, but the barber was one\r\nof them who never can make money. Whoever owed him money did not pay.\r\nWhenever he had a chance at a good job he fell sick and could not\r\ntake it. It was never his own fault that he had trouble, but he never\r\nseemed to make things come out right.\r\n\r\nHis wife was a blonde, thin, pale, german little woman, who bore her\r\nchildren very hard, and worked too soon, and then till she was sick.\r\nShe too, always had things that went wrong.\r\n\r\nThey both needed constant help and patience, and the good Anna gave\r\nboth to them all the time.\r\n\r\nAnother woman who needed help from the good Anna, was one who was in\r\ntrouble from being good to others.\r\n\r\nThis woman\'s husband\'s brother, who was very good, worked in a shop\r\nwhere there was a Bohemian, who was getting sick with consumption.\r\nThis man got so much worse he could not do his work, but he was not\r\nso sick that he could stay in a hospital. So this woman had him living\r\nthere with her. He was not a nice man, nor was he thankful for all the\r\nwoman did for him. He was cross to her two children and made a great\r\nmess always in her house. The doctor said he must have many things to\r\neat, and the woman and the brother of the husband got them for him.\r\n\r\nThere was no friendship, no affection, no liking even for the man\r\nthis woman cared for, no claim of common country or of kin, but in the\r\nkindly fashion of the poor this woman gave her all and made her house\r\na nasty place, and for a man who was not even grateful for the gift.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, the woman herself got into trouble. Her husband\'s\r\nbrother was now married. Her husband lost his job. She did not have\r\nthe money for the rent. It was the good Anna\'s savings that were\r\nhandy.\r\n\r\nSo it went on. Sometimes a little girl, sometimes a big one was in\r\ntrouble and Anna heard of them and helped them to find places.\r\n\r\nStray dogs and cats Anna always kept until she found them homes. She\r\nwas always careful to learn whether these people would be good to\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nOut of the whole collection of stray creatures, it was the young Peter\r\nand the jolly little Rags, Anna could not find it in her heart to\r\npart with. These became part of the household of the good Anna\'s Miss\r\nMathilda.\r\n\r\nPeter was a very useless creature, a foolish, silly, cherished,\r\ncoward male. It was wild to see him rush up and down in the back yard,\r\nbarking and bouncing at the wall, when there was some dog out beyond,\r\nbut when the very littlest one there was got inside of the fence and\r\nonly looked at Peter, Peter would retire to his Anna and blot himself\r\nout between her skirts.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter was left downstairs alone, he howled. "I am all alone," he\r\nwailed, and then the good Anna would have to come and fetch him up.\r\nOnce when Anna stayed a few nights in a house not far away, she had to\r\ncarry Peter all the way, for Peter was afraid when he found himself on\r\nthe street outside his house. Peter was a good sized creature and he\r\nsat there and he howled, and the good Anna carried him all the way\r\nin her own arms. He was a coward was this Peter, but he had kindly,\r\ngentle eyes and a pretty collie head, and his fur was very thick and\r\nwhite and nice when he was washed. And then Peter never strayed away,\r\nand he looked out of his nice eyes and he liked it when you rubbed\r\nhim down, and he forgot you when you went away, and he barked whenever\r\nthere was any noise.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a little pup he had one night been put into the yard and\r\nthat was all of his origin she knew. The good Anna loved him well and\r\nspoiled him as a good german mother always does her son.\r\n\r\nLittle Rags was very different in his nature. He was a lively creature\r\nmade out of ends of things, all fluffy and dust color, and he was\r\nalways bounding up into the air and darting all about over and then\r\nunder silly Peter and often straight into solemn fat, blind, sleepy\r\nBaby, and then in a wild rush after some stray cat.\r\n\r\nRags was a pleasant, jolly little fellow. The good Anna liked him\r\nvery well, but never with her strength as she loved her good looking\r\ncoward, foolish young man, Peter.\r\n\r\nBaby was the dog of her past life and she held Anna with old ties of\r\npast affection. Peter was the spoiled, good looking young man, of her\r\nmiddle age, and Rags was always something of a toy. She liked him but\r\nhe never struck in very deep. Rags had strayed in somehow one day and\r\nthen when no home for him was quickly found, he had just stayed right\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIt was a very happy family there all together in the kitchen, the good\r\nAnna and Sally and old Baby and young Peter and the jolly little Rags.\r\n\r\nThe parrot had passed out of Anna\'s life. She had really never loved\r\nthe parrot and now she hardly thought to ask for him, even when she\r\nvisited the Drehtens.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drehten was the friend Anna always went to, for her Sundays. She\r\ndid not get advice from Mrs. Drehten as she used to from the widow,\r\nMrs. Lehntman, for Mrs. Drehten was a mild, worn, unaggressive\r\nnature that never cared to influence or to lead. But they could mourn\r\ntogether for the world these two worn, working german women, for its\r\nsadness and its wicked ways of doing. Mrs. Drehten knew so well what\r\none could suffer.\r\n\r\nThings did not go well in these days with the Drehtens. The children\r\nwere all good, but the father with his temper and his spending kept\r\neverything from being what it should.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Drehten still had trouble with her tumor. She could hardly\r\ndo any work now any more. Mrs. Drehten was a large, worn, patient\r\ngerman woman, with a soft face, lined, yellow brown in color and the\r\nlook that comes from a german husband to obey, and many solid girls\r\nand boys to bear and rear, and from being always on one\'s feet and\r\nnever having any troubles cured.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drehten was always getting worse, and now the doctor thought it\r\nwould be best to take the tumor out.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer Dr. Shonjen who treated Mrs. Drehten. They all went\r\nnow to a good old german doctor they all knew.\r\n\r\n"You see, Miss Mathilda," Anna said, "All the old german patients\r\ndon\'t go no more now to Doctor. I stayed with him just so long as\r\nI could stand it, but now he is moved away up town too far for poor\r\npeople, and his wife, she holds her head up so and always is spending\r\nso much money just for show, and so he can\'t take right care of us\r\npoor people any more. Poor man, he has got always to be thinking about\r\nmaking money now. I am awful sorry about Doctor, Miss Mathilda, but\r\nhe neglected Mrs. Drehten shameful when she had her trouble, so now I\r\nnever see him any more. Doctor Herman is a good, plain, german doctor\r\nand he would never do things so, and Miss Mathilda, Mrs. Drehten is\r\ncoming in to-morrow to see you before she goes to the hospital for her\r\noperation. She could not go comfortable till she had seen you first to\r\nsee what you would say."\r\n\r\nAll Anna\'s friends reverenced the good Anna\'s cherished Miss Mathilda.\r\nHow could they not do so and still remain friends with the good Anna?\r\nMiss Mathilda rarely really saw them but they were always sending\r\nflowers and words of admiration through her Anna. Every now and then\r\nAnna would bring one of them to Miss Mathilda for advice.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how poor people love to take advice from people who\r\nare friendly and above them, from people who read in books and who are\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nMiss Mathilda saw Mrs. Drehten and told her she was glad that she was\r\ngoing to the hospital for operation for that surely would be best, and\r\nso good Mrs. Drehten\'s mind was set at rest.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drehten\'s tumor came out very well. Mrs. Drehten was afterwards\r\nnever really well, but she could do her work a little better, and be\r\non her feet and yet not get so tired.\r\n\r\nAnd so Anna\'s life went on, taking care of Miss Mathilda and all her\r\nclothes and goods, and being good to every one that asked or seemed to\r\nneed her help.\r\n\r\nNow, slowly, Anna began to make it up with Mrs. Lehntman. They could\r\nnever be as they had been before. Mrs, Lehntman could never be again\r\nthe romance in the good Anna\'s life, but they could be friends again,\r\nand Anna could help all the Lehntmans in their need. This slowly came\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman had now left the evil and mysterious man who had been\r\nthe cause of all her trouble. She had given up, too, the new big\r\nhouse that she had taken. Since her trouble her practice had been\r\nvery quiet. Still she managed to do fairly well. She began to talk of\r\npaying the good Anna. This, however, had not gotten very far.\r\n\r\nAnna saw Mrs. Lehntman a good deal now. Mrs. Lehntman\'s crisp, black,\r\ncurly hair had gotten streaked with gray. Her dark, full, good looking\r\nface had lost its firm outline, gone flabby and a little worn. She had\r\ngrown stouter and her clothes did not look very nice. She was as bland\r\nas ever in her ways, and as diffuse as always in her attention, but\r\nthrough it all there was uneasiness and fear and uncertainty lest some\r\ndanger might be near.\r\n\r\nShe never said a word of her past life to the good Anna, but it was\r\nvery plain to see that her experience had not left her easy, nor yet\r\naltogether free.\r\n\r\nIt had been hard for this good woman, for Mrs. Lehntman was really a\r\ngood woman, it had been a very hard thing for this german woman to do\r\nwhat everybody knew and thought was wrong. Mrs. Lehntman was strong\r\nand she had courage, but it had been very hard to bear. Even the\r\ngood Anna did not speak to her with freedom. There always remained a\r\nmystery and a depression in Mrs. Lehntman\'s affair.\r\n\r\nAnd now the blonde, foolish, awkward daughter, Julia was in trouble.\r\nDuring the years the mother gave her no attention, Julia kept company\r\nwith a young fellow who was a clerk somewhere in a store down in the\r\ncity. He was a decent, dull young fellow, who did not make much money\r\nand could never save it for he had an old mother he supported. He\r\nand Julia had been keeping company for several years and now it was\r\nneedful that they should be married. But then how could they marry?\r\nHe did not make enough to start them and to keep on supporting his old\r\nmother too. Julia was not used to working much and she said, and she\r\nwas stubborn, that she would not live with Charley\'s dirty, cross, old\r\nmother. Mrs. Lehntman had no money. She was just beginning to get on\r\nher feet. It was of course, the good Anna\'s savings that were handy.\r\n\r\nHowever it paid Anna to bring about this marriage, paid her in\r\nscoldings and in managing the dull, long, awkward Julia, and her good,\r\npatient, stupid Charley. Anna loved to buy things cheap, and fix up a\r\nnew place.\r\n\r\nJulia and Charley were soon married and things went pretty well with\r\nthem. Anna did not approve their slack, expensive ways of doing.\r\n\r\n"No Miss Mathilda," she would say, "The young people nowadays have no\r\nsense for saving and putting money by so they will have something to\r\nuse when they need it. There\'s Julia and her Charley. I went in there\r\nthe other day, Miss Mathilda, and they had a new table with a marble\r\ntop and on it they had a grand new plush album. \'Where you get that\r\nalbum?\' I asked Julia. \'Oh, Charley he gave it to me for my birthday,\'\r\nshe said, and I asked her if it was paid for and she said not all\r\nyet but it would be soon. Now I ask you what business have they Miss\r\nMathilda, when they ain\'t paid for anything they got already, what\r\nbusiness have they to be buying new things for her birthdays. Julia\r\nshe don\'t do no work, she just sits around and thinks how she can\r\nspend the money, and Charley he never puts one cent by. I never see\r\nanything like the people nowadays Miss Mathilda, they don\'t seem to\r\nhave any sense of being careful about money. Julia and Charley when\r\nthey have any children they won\'t have nothing to bring them up with\r\nright. I said that to Julia, Miss Mathilda, when she showed me those\r\nsilly things that Charley bought her, and she just said in her silly,\r\ngiggling way, perhaps they won\'t have any children. I told her she\r\nought to be ashamed of talking so, but I don\'t know, Miss Mathilda,\r\nthe young people nowadays have no sense at all of what\'s the right\r\nway for them to do, and perhaps its better if they don\'t have any\r\nchildren, and then Miss Mathilda you know there is Mrs. Lehntman. You\r\nknow she regular adopted little Johnny just so she could pay out some\r\nmore money just as if she didn\'t have trouble enough taking care of\r\nher own children. No Miss Mathilda, I never see how people can do\r\nthings so. People don\'t seem to have no sense of right or wrong or\r\nanything these days Miss Mathilda, they are just careless and thinking\r\nalways of themselves and how they can always have a happy time. No,\r\nMiss Mathilda I don\'t see how people can go on and do things so."\r\n\r\nThe good Anna could not understand the careless and bad ways of all\r\nthe world and always she grew bitter with it all. No, not one of them\r\nhad any sense of what was the right way for them to do.\r\n\r\nAnna\'s past life was now drawing to an end. Her old blind dog, Baby,\r\nwas sick and like to die. Baby had been the first gift from her friend\r\nthe widow, Mrs. Lehntman in the old days when Anna had been with Miss\r\nMary Wadsmith, and when these two women had first come together.\r\n\r\nThrough all the years of change, Baby had stayed with the good Anna,\r\ngrowing old and fat and blind and lazy. Baby had been active and a\r\nratter when she was young, but that was so long ago it was forgotten,\r\nand for many years now Baby had wanted only her warm basket and her\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nAnna in her active life found need of others, of Peter and the funny\r\nlittle Rags, but always Baby was the eldest and held her with the ties\r\nof old affection. Anna was harsh when the young ones tried to keep\r\npoor Baby out and use her basket. Baby had been blind now for some\r\nyears as dogs get, when they are no longer active. She got weak and\r\nfat and breathless and she could not even stand long any more. Anna\r\nhad always to see that she got her dinner and that the young active\r\nones did not deprive her.\r\n\r\nBaby did not die with a real sickness. She just got older and more\r\nblind and coughed and then more quiet, and then slowly one bright\r\nsummer\'s day she died.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more dreary than old age in animals. Somehow it is\r\nall wrong that they should have grey hair and withered skin, and blind\r\nold eyes, and decayed and useless teeth. An old man or an old woman\r\nalmost always has some tie that seems to bind them to the younger,\r\nrealer life. They have children or the remembrance of old duties, but\r\na dog that\'s old and so cut off from all its world of struggle, is\r\nlike a dreary, deathless Struldbrug, the dreary dragger on of death\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\nAnd so one day old Baby died. It was dreary, more than sad, for the\r\ngood Anna. She did not want the poor old beast to linger with its\r\nweary age, and blind old eyes and dismal shaking cough, but this death\r\nleft Anna very empty. She had the foolish young man Peter, and the\r\njolly little Rags for comfort, but Baby had been the only one that\r\ncould remember.\r\n\r\nThe good Anna wanted a real graveyard for her Baby, but this could not\r\nbe in a Christian country, and so Anna all alone took her old friend\r\ndone up in decent wrappings and put her into the ground in some quiet\r\nplace that Anna knew of.\r\n\r\nThe good Anna did not weep for poor old Baby. Nay, she had not time\r\neven to feel lonely, for with the good Anna it was sorrow upon sorrow.\r\nShe was now no longer to keep house for Miss Mathilda.\r\n\r\nWhen Anna had first come to Miss Mathilda she had known that it might\r\nonly be for a few years, for Miss Mathilda was given to much wandering\r\nand often changed her home, and found new places where she went to\r\nlive. The good Anna did not then think much about this, for when she\r\nfirst went to Miss Mathilda she had not thought that she would like\r\nit and so she had not worried about staying. Then in those happy years\r\nthat they had been together, Anna had made herself forget it. This\r\nlast year when she knew that it was coming she had tried hard to think\r\nit would not happen.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t talk about it now Miss Mathilda, perhaps we all be dead by\r\nthen," she would say when Miss Mathilda tried to talk it over. Or, "If\r\nwe live till then Miss Mathilda, perhaps you will be staying on right\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nNo, the good Anna could not talk as if this thing were real, it was\r\ntoo weary to be once more left with strangers.\r\n\r\nBoth the good Anna and her cherished Miss Mathilda tried hard to think\r\nthat this would not really happen. Anna made missions and all kinds of\r\nthings to keep her Miss Mathilda and Miss Mathilda thought out all the\r\nways to see if the good Anna could not go with her, but neither the\r\nmissions nor the plans had much success. Miss Mathilda would go, and\r\nshe was going far away to a new country where Anna could not live, for\r\nshe would be too lonesome.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing that these two could do but part. Perhaps we all be\r\ndead by then, the good Anna would repeat, but even that did not really\r\nhappen. If we all live till then Miss Mathilda, came out truer. They\r\nall did live till then, all except poor old blind Baby, and they\r\nsimply had to part.\r\n\r\nPoor Anna and poor Miss Mathilda. They could not look at each other\r\nthat last day. Anna could not keep herself busy working. She just went\r\nin and out and sometimes scolded.\r\n\r\nAnna could not make up her mind what she should do now for her future.\r\nShe said that she would for a while keep this little red brick house\r\nthat they had lived in. Perhaps she might just take in a few boarders.\r\nShe did not know, she would write about it later and tell it all to\r\nMiss Mathilda.\r\n\r\nThe dreary day dragged out and then all was ready and Miss Mathilda\r\nleft to take her train. Anna stood strained and pale and dry eyed\r\non the white stone steps of the little red brick house that they had\r\nlived in. The last thing Miss Mathilda heard was the good Anna bidding\r\nfoolish Peter say good bye and be sure to remember Miss Mathilda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF THE GOOD ANNA\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one who had known of Miss Mathilda wanted the good Anna now to\r\ntake a place with them, for they all knew how well Anna could take\r\ncare of people and all their clothes and goods. Anna too could always\r\ngo to Curden to Miss Mary Wadsmith, but none of all these ways seemed\r\nvery good to Anna.\r\n\r\nIt was not now any longer that she wanted to stay near Mrs. Lehntman.\r\nThere was no one now that made anything important, but Anna was\r\ncertain that she did not want to take a place where she would be\r\nunder some new people. No one could ever be for Anna as had been her\r\ncherished Miss Mathilda. No one could ever again so freely let her do\r\nit all. It would be better Anna thought in her strong strained weary\r\nbody, it would be better just to keep on there in the little red\r\nbrick house that was all furnished, and make a living taking in some\r\nboarders. Miss Mathilda had let her have the things, so it would not\r\ncost any money to begin. She could perhaps manage to live on so. She\r\ncould do all the work and do everything as she thought best, and she\r\nwas too weary with the changes to do more than she just had to, to\r\nkeep living. So she stayed on in the house where they had lived, and\r\nshe found some men, she would not take in women, who took her rooms\r\nand who were her boarders.\r\n\r\nThings soon with Anna began to be less dreary. She was very popular\r\nwith her few boarders. They loved her scoldings and the good things\r\nshe made for them to eat. They made good jokes and laughed loud and\r\nalways did whatever Anna wanted, and soon the good Anna got so that\r\nshe liked it very well. Not that she did not always long for Miss\r\nMathilda. She hoped and waited and was very certain that sometime,\r\nin one year or in another Miss Mathilda would come back, and then of\r\ncourse would want her, and then she could take all good care of her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnna kept all Miss Mathilda\'s things in the best order. The boarders\r\nwere well scolded if they ever made a scratch on Miss Mathilda\'s\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nSome of the boarders were hearty good south german fellows and Anna\r\nalways made them go to mass. One boarder was a lusty german student\r\nwho was studying in Bridgepoint to be a doctor. He was Anna\'s special\r\nfavourite and she scolded him as she used to her old doctor so that he\r\nalways would be good. Then, too, this cheery fellow always sang when\r\nhe was washing, and that was what Miss Mathilda always used to do.\r\nAnna\'s heart grew warm again with this young fellow who seemed to\r\nbring back to her everything she needed.\r\n\r\nAnd so Anna\'s life in these days was not all unhappy. She worked and\r\nscolded, she had her stray dogs and cats and people, who all asked and\r\nseemed to need her care, and she had hearty german fellows who loved\r\nher scoldings and ate so much of the good things that she knew so well\r\nthe way to make.\r\n\r\nNo, the good Anna\'s life in these days was not all unhappy. She did\r\nnot see her old friends much, she was too busy, but once in a great\r\nwhile she took a Sunday afternoon and went to see good Mrs. Drehten.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble was that Anna hardly made a living. She charged so\r\nlittle for her board and gave her people such good things to eat, that\r\nshe could only just make both ends meet. The good german priest to\r\nwhom she always told her troubles tried to make her have the boarders\r\npay a little higher, and Miss Mathilda always in her letters urged her\r\nto this thing, but the good Anna somehow could not do it. Her boarders\r\nwere nice men but she knew they did not have much money, and then she\r\ncould not raise on those who had been with her and she could not ask\r\nthe new ones to pay higher, when those who were already there were\r\npaying just what they had paid before. So Anna let it go just as she\r\nhad begun it. She worked and worked all day and thought all night how\r\nshe could save, and with all the work she just managed to keep living.\r\nShe could not make enough to lay any money by.\r\n\r\nAnna got so little money that she had all the work to do herself. She\r\ncould not pay even the little Sally enough to keep her with her.\r\n\r\nNot having little Sally nor having any one else working with her, made\r\nit very hard for Anna ever to go out, for she never thought that\r\nit was right to leave a house all empty. Once in a great while of a\r\nSunday, Sally who was now working in a factory would come and stay\r\nin the house for the good Anna, who would then go out and spend the\r\nafternoon with Mrs. Drehten.\r\n\r\nNo, Anna did not see her old friends much any more. She went sometimes\r\nto see her half brother and his wife and her nieces, and they always\r\ncame to her on her birthdays to give presents, and her half brother\r\nnever left her out of his festive raisined bread giving progresses.\r\nBut these relatives of hers had never meant very much to the good\r\nAnna. Anna always did her duty by them all, and she liked her half\r\nbrother very well and the loaves of raisined bread that he supplied\r\nher were most welcome now, and Anna always gave her god daughter and\r\nher sister handsome presents, but no one in this family had ever made\r\na way inside to Anna\'s feelings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lehntman she saw very rarely. It is hard to build up new on\r\nan old friendship when in that friendship there has been bitter\r\ndisillusion. They did their best, both these women to be friends, but\r\nthey were never able to again touch one another nearly. There were too\r\nmany things between them that they could not speak of, things that\r\nhad never been explained nor yet forgiven. The good Anna still did her\r\nbest for foolish Julia and still every now and then saw Mrs. Lehntman,\r\nbut this family had now lost all its real hold on Anna.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drehten was now the best friend that Anna knew. Here there was\r\nnever any more than the mingling of their sorrows. They talked over\r\nall the time the best way for Mrs. Drehten now to do; poor Mrs.\r\nDrehten who with her chief trouble, her bad husband, had really now no\r\nway that she could do. She just had to work and to be patient and to\r\nlove her children and be very quiet. She always had a soothing mother\r\ninfluence on the good Anna who with her irritable, strained, worn-out\r\nbody would come and sit by Mrs. Drehten and talk all her troubles\r\nover.\r\n\r\nOf all the friends that the good Anna had had in these twenty years\r\nin Bridgepoint, the good father and patient Mrs. Drehten were the\r\nonly ones that were now near to Anna and with whom she could talk her\r\ntroubles over.\r\n\r\nAnna worked, and thought, and saved, and scolded, and took care of all\r\nthe boarders, and of Peter and of Rags, and all the others. There was\r\nnever any end to Anna\'s effort and she grew always more tired, more\r\npale yellow, and in her face more thin and worn and worried. Sometimes\r\nshe went farther in not being well, and then she went to see Dr.\r\nHerman who had operated on good Mrs. Drehten.\r\n\r\nThe things that Anna really needed were to rest sometimes and eat more\r\nso that she could get stronger, but these were the last things that\r\nAnna could bring herself to do. Anna could never take a rest. She must\r\nwork hard through the summer as well as through the winter, else she\r\ncould never make both ends meet. The doctor gave her medicines to make\r\nher stronger but these did not seem to do much good.\r\n\r\nAnna grew always more tired, her headaches came oftener and harder,\r\nand she was now almost always feeling very sick. She could not sleep\r\nmuch in the night. The dogs with their noises disturbed her and\r\neverything in her body seemed to pain her.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the good father tried often to make her give herself\r\nmore care. Mrs. Drehten told her that she surely would not get well\r\nunless for a little while she would stop working. Anna would then\r\npromise to take care, to rest in bed a little longer and to eat more\r\nso that she would get stronger, but really how could Anna eat when she\r\nalways did the cooking and was so tired of it all, before it was half\r\nready for the table?\r\n\r\nAnna\'s only friendship now was with good Mrs. Drehten who was too\r\ngentle and too patient to make a stubborn faithful german Anna ever do\r\nthe way she should, in the things that were for her own good.\r\n\r\nAnna grew worse all through this second winter. When the summer came\r\nthe doctor said that she simply could not live on so. He said she must\r\ngo to his hospital and there he would operate upon her. She would then\r\nbe well and strong and able to work hard all next winter.\r\n\r\nAnna for some time would not listen. She could not do this so, for\r\nshe had her house all furnished and she simply could not let it go. At\r\nlast a woman came and said she would take care of Anna\'s boarders and\r\nthen Anna said that she was prepared to go.\r\n\r\nAnna went to the hospital for her operation. Mrs. Drehten was herself\r\nnot well but she came into the city, so that some friend would be\r\nwith the good Anna. Together, then, they went to this place where the\r\ndoctor had done so well by Mrs. Drehten.\r\n\r\nIn a few days they had Anna ready. Then they did the operation, and\r\nthen the good Anna with her strong, strained, worn-out body died.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drehten sent word of her death to Miss Mathilda.\r\n\r\n"Dear Miss Mathilda," wrote Mrs. Drehten, "Miss Annie died in the\r\nhospital yesterday after a hard operation. She was talking about you\r\nand Doctor and Miss Mary Wadsmith all the time. She said she hoped\r\nyou would take Peter and the little Rags to keep when you came back\r\nto America to live. I will keep them for you here Miss Mathilda. Miss\r\nAnnie died easy, Miss Mathilda, and sent you her love."\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCTHA\r\n\r\nEACH ONE AS SHE MAY\r\n\r\n\r\nRose Johnson made it very hard to bring her baby to its birth.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert who was Rose Johnson\'s friend, did everything that\r\nany woman could. She tended Rose, and she was patient, submissive,\r\nsoothing, and untiring, while the sullen, childish, cowardly, black\r\nRosie grumbled and fussed and howled and made herself to be an\r\nabomination and like a simple beast.\r\n\r\nThe child though it was healthy after it was born, did not live\r\nlong. Rose Johnson was careless and negligent and selfish, and when\r\nMelanctha had to leave for a few days, the baby died. Rose Johnson had\r\nliked the baby well enough and perhaps she just forgot it for awhile,\r\nanyway the child was dead and Rose and Sam her husband were very sorry\r\nbut then these things came so often in the negro world in Bridgepoint,\r\nthat they neither of them thought about it very long.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson and Melanctha Herbert had been friends now for some\r\nyears. Rose had lately married Sam Johnson a decent honest kindly\r\nfellow, a deck hand on a coasting steamer.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert had not yet been really married.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson was a real black, tall, well built, sullen, stupid,\r\nchildlike, good looking negress. She laughed when she was happy and\r\ngrumbled and was sullen with everything that troubled.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson was a real black negress but she had been brought up\r\nquite like their own child by white folks.\r\n\r\nRose laughed when she was happy but she had not the wide, abandoned\r\nlaughter that makes the warm broad glow of negro sunshine. Rose was\r\nnever joyous with the earth-born, boundless joy of negroes. Hers was\r\njust ordinary, any sort of woman laughter.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson was careless and was lazy, but she had been brought up by\r\nwhite folks and she needed decent comfort. Her white training had\r\nonly made for habits, not for nature. Rose had the simple, promiscuous\r\nimmorality of the black people.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson and Melanctha Herbert like many of the twos with women\r\nwere a curious pair to be such friends.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert was a graceful, pale yellow, intelligent, attractive\r\nnegress. She had not been raised like Rose by white folks but then she\r\nhad been half made with real white blood.\r\n\r\nShe and Rose Johnson were both of the better sort of negroes, there,\r\nin Bridgepoint.\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t no common nigger," said Rose Johnson, "for I was raised\r\nby white folks, and Melanctha she is so bright and learned so much\r\nin school, she ain\'t no common nigger either, though she ain\'t got no\r\nhusband to be married to like I am to Sam Johnson."\r\n\r\nWhy did the subtle, intelligent, attractive, half white girl Melanctha\r\nHerbert love and do for and demean herself in service to this coarse,\r\ndecent, sullen, ordinary, black childish Rose, and why was this\r\nunmoral, promiscuous, shiftless Rose married, and that\'s not so common\r\neither, to a good man of the negroes, while Melanctha with her white\r\nblood and attraction and her desire for a right position had not yet\r\nbeen really married.\r\n\r\nSometimes the thought of how all her world was made, filled the\r\ncomplex, desiring Melanctha with despair. She wondered, often, how she\r\ncould go on living when she was so blue.\r\n\r\nMelanctha told Rose one day how a woman whom she knew had killed\r\nherself because she was so blue. Melanctha said, sometimes, she\r\nthought this was the best thing for her herself to do.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson did not see it the least bit that way.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see Melanctha why you should talk like you would kill\r\nyourself just because you\'re blue. I\'d never kill myself Melanctha\r\njust \'cause I was blue. I\'d maybe kill somebody else Melanctha\r\n\'cause I was blue, but I\'d never kill myself. If I ever killed myself\r\nMelanctha it\'d be by accident, and if I ever killed myself by accident\r\nMelanctha, I\'d be awful sorry."\r\n\r\nRose Johnson and Melanctha Herbert had first met, one night, at\r\nchurch. Rose Johnson did not care much for religion. She had not\r\nenough emotion to be really roused by a revival. Melanctha Herbert had\r\nnot come yet to know how to use religion. She was still too complex\r\nwith desire. However, the two of them in negro fashion went very often\r\nto the negro church, along with all their friends, and they slowly\r\ncame to know each other very well.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson had been raised not as a servant but quite like their own\r\nchild by white folks. Her mother who had died when Rose was still\r\na baby, had been a trusted servant in the family. Rose was a cute,\r\nattractive, good looking little black girl and these people had no\r\nchildren of their own and so they kept Rose in their house.\r\n\r\nAs Rose grew older she drifted from her white folks back to the\r\ncolored people, and she gradually no longer lived in the old house.\r\nThen it happened that these people went away to some other town to\r\nlive, and somehow Rose stayed behind in Bridgepoint. Her white folks\r\nleft a little money to take care of Rose, and this money she got every\r\nlittle while.\r\n\r\nRose now in the easy fashion of the poor lived with one woman in her\r\nhouse, and then for no reason went and lived with some other woman\r\nin her house. All this time, too, Rose kept company, and was engaged,\r\nfirst to this colored man and then to that, and always she made sure\r\nshe was engaged, for Rose had strong the sense of proper conduct.\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t no common nigger just to go around with any man, nor you\r\nMelanctha shouldn\'t neither," she said one day when she was telling\r\nthe complex and less sure Melanctha what was the right way for her to\r\ndo. "No Melanctha, I ain\'t no common nigger to do so, for I was raised\r\nby white folks. You know very well Melanctha that I\'se always been\r\nengaged to them."\r\n\r\nAnd so Rose lived on, always comfortable and rather decent and very\r\nlazy and very well content.\r\n\r\nAfter she had lived some time this way, Rose thought it would be nice\r\nand very good in her position to get regularly really married. She had\r\nlately met Sam Johnson somewhere, and she liked him and she knew he\r\nwas a good man, and then he had a place where he worked every day\r\nand got good wages. Sam Johnson liked Rose very well and he was quite\r\nready to be married. One day they had a grand real wedding and were\r\nmarried. Then with Melanctha Herbert\'s help to do the sewing and the\r\nnicer work, they furnished comfortably a little red brick house. Sam\r\nthen went back to his work as deck hand on a coasting steamer, and\r\nRose stayed home in her house and sat and bragged to all her friends\r\nhow nice it was to be married really to a husband.\r\n\r\nLife went on very smoothly with them all the year. Rose was lazy\r\nbut not dirty and Sam was careful but not fussy, and then there was\r\nMelanctha to come in every day and help to keep things neat.\r\n\r\nWhen Rose\'s baby was coming to be born, Rose came to stay in the\r\nhouse where Melanctha Herbert lived just then, with a big good natured\r\ncolored woman who did washing.\r\n\r\nRose went there to stay, so that she might have the doctor from the\r\nhospital near by to help her have the baby, and then, too, Melanctha\r\ncould attend to her while she was sick.\r\n\r\nHere the baby was born, and here it died, and then Rose went back to\r\nher house again with Sam.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert had not made her life all simple like Rose Johnson.\r\nMelanctha had not found it easy with herself to make her wants and\r\nwhat she had, agree.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert was always losing what she had in wanting all the\r\nthings she saw. Melanctha was always being left when she was not\r\nleaving others.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert always loved too hard and much too often. She was\r\nalways full with mystery and subtle movements and denials and vague\r\ndistrusts and complicated disillusions. Then Melanctha would be sudden\r\nand impulsive and unbounded in some faith, and then she would suffer\r\nand be strong in her repression.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert was always seeking rest and quiet, and always she\r\ncould only find new ways to be in trouble.\r\n\r\nMelanctha wondered often how it was she did not kill herself when she\r\nwas so blue. Often she thought this would be really the best way for\r\nher to do.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert had been raised to be religious, by her mother.\r\nMelanctha had not liked her mother very well. This mother, \'Mis\'\r\nHerbert, as her neighbors called her, had been a sweet appearing and\r\ndignified and pleasant, pale yellow, colored woman. \'Mis\' Herbert had\r\nalways been a little wandering and mysterious and uncertain in her\r\nways.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was pale yellow and mysterious and a little pleasant like\r\nher mother, but the real power in Melanctha\'s nature came through her\r\nrobust and unpleasant and very unendurable black father.\r\n\r\nMelanctha\'s father only used to come to where Melanctha and her mother\r\nlived, once in a while.\r\n\r\nIt was many years now that Melanctha had not heard or seen or known of\r\nanything her father did.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert almost always hated her black father, but she loved\r\nvery well the power in herself that came through him. And so her\r\nfeeling was really closer to her black coarse father, than her feeling\r\nhad ever been toward her pale yellow, sweet-appearing mother. The\r\nthings she had in her of her mother never made her feel respect.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert had not loved herself in childhood. All of her youth\r\nwas bitter to remember.\r\n\r\nMelanctha had not loved her father and her mother and they had found\r\nit very troublesome to have her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha\'s mother and her father had been regularly married.\r\nMelanctha\'s father was a big black virile negro. He only came once\r\nin a while to where Melanctha and her mother lived, but always that\r\npleasant, sweet-appearing, pale yellow woman, mysterious and uncertain\r\nand wandering in her ways, was close in sympathy and thinking to her\r\nbig black virile husband.\r\n\r\nJames Herbert was a common, decent enough, colored workman, brutal and\r\nrough to his one daughter, but then she was a most disturbing child to\r\nmanage.\r\n\r\nThe young Melanctha did not love her father and her mother, and she\r\nhad a break neck courage, and a tongue that could be very nasty. Then,\r\ntoo, Melanctha went to school and was very quick in all the learning,\r\nand she knew very well how to use this knowledge to annoy her parents\r\nwho knew nothing.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert had always had a break neck courage. Melanctha\r\nalways loved to be with horses; she loved to do wild things, to ride\r\nthe horses and to break and tame them.\r\n\r\nMelanctha, when she was a little girl, had had a good chance to live\r\nwith horses. Near where Melanctha and her mother lived was the stable\r\nof the Bishops, a rich family who always had fine horses.\r\n\r\nJohn, the Bishops\' coachman, liked Melanctha very well and he always\r\nlet her do anything she wanted with the horses. John was a decent,\r\nvigorous mulatto with a prosperous house and wife and children.\r\nMelanctha Herbert was older than any of his children. She was now a\r\nwell grown girl of twelve and just beginning as a woman.\r\n\r\nJames Herbert, Melanctha\'s father, knew this John, the Bishops\'\r\ncoachman very well.\r\n\r\nOne day James Herbert came to where his wife and daughter lived, and\r\nhe was furious.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s that Melanctha girl of yours," he said fiercely, "if she is\r\nto the Bishops\' stables again, with that man John, I swear I kill her.\r\nWhy don\'t you see to that girl better you, you\'re her mother."\r\n\r\nJames Herbert was a powerful, loose built, hard handed, black, angry\r\nnegro. Herbert never was a joyous negro. Even when he drank with other\r\nmen, and he did that very, often, he was never really joyous. In the\r\ndays when he had been most young and free and open, he had never\r\nhad the wide abandoned laughter that gives the broad glow to negro\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nHis daughter, Melanctha Herbert, later always made a hard forced\r\nlaughter. She was only strong and sweet and in her nature when she was\r\nreally deep in trouble, when she was fighting so with all she really\r\nhad, that she did not use her laughter. This was always true of poor\r\nMelanctha who was always so certain that she hated trouble. Melanctha\r\nHerbert was always seeking peace and quiet, and she could always only\r\nfind new ways to get excited.\r\n\r\nJames Herbert was often a very angry negro. He was fierce and serious,\r\nand he was very certain that he often had good reason to be angry with\r\nMelanctha, who knew so well how to be nasty, and to use her learning\r\nwith a father who knew nothing.\r\n\r\nJames Herbert often drank with John, the Bishops\' coachman. John in\r\nhis good nature sometimes tried to soften Herbert\'s feeling toward\r\nMelanctha. Not that Melanctha ever complained to John of her home life\r\nor her father. It was never Melanctha\'s way, even in the midst of\r\nher worst trouble to complain to any one of what happened to her, but\r\nnevertheless somehow every one who knew Melanctha always knew how much\r\nshe suffered. It was only while one really loved Melanctha that one\r\nunderstood how to forgive her, that she never once complained nor\r\nlooked unhappy, and was always handsome and in spirits, and yet one\r\nalways knew how much she suffered.\r\n\r\nThe father, James Herbert, never told his troubles either, and he was\r\nso fierce and serious that no one ever thought of asking.\r\n\r\n\'Mis\' Herbert as her neighbors called her was never heard even\r\nto speak of her husband or her daughter. She was always pleasant,\r\nsweet-appearing, mysterious and uncertain, and a little wandering in\r\nher ways.\r\n\r\nThe Herberts were a silent family with their troubles, but somehow\r\nevery one who knew them always knew everything that happened.\r\n\r\nThe morning of one day when in the evening Herbert and the coachman\r\nJohn were to meet to drink together, Melanctha had to come to the\r\nstable joyous and in the very best of humors. Her good friend John on\r\nthis morning felt very firmly how good and sweet she was and how very\r\nmuch she suffered.\r\n\r\nJohn was a very decent colored coachman. When he thought about\r\nMelanctha it was as if she were the eldest of his children. Really\r\nhe felt very strongly the power in her of a woman. John\'s wife always\r\nliked Melanctha and she always did all she could to make things\r\npleasant. And Melanctha all her life loved and respected kind and good\r\nand considerate people. Melanctha always loved and wanted peace and\r\ngentleness and goodness and all her life for herself poor Melanctha\r\ncould only find new ways to be in trouble.\r\n\r\nThis evening after John and Herbert had drunk awhile together, the\r\ngood John began to tell the father what a fine girl he had for a\r\ndaughter. Perhaps the good John had been drinking a good deal of\r\nliquor, perhaps there was a gleam of something softer than the feeling\r\nof a friendly elder in the way John then spoke of Melanctha. There had\r\nbeen a good deal of drinking and John certainly that very morning had\r\nfelt strongly Melanctha\'s power as a woman. James Herbert was always\r\na fierce, suspicious, serious negro, and drinking never made him feel\r\nmore open. He looked very black and evil as he sat and listened while\r\nJohn grew more and more admiring as he talked half to himself, half to\r\nthe father, of the virtues and the sweetness of Melanctha.\r\n\r\nSuddenly between them there came a moment filled full with strong\r\nblack curses, and then sharp razors flashed in the black hands, that\r\nheld them flung backward in the negro fashion, and then for some\r\nminutes there was fierce slashing.\r\n\r\nJohn was a decent, pleasant, good natured, light brown negro, but he\r\nknew how to use a razor to do bloody slashing.\r\n\r\nWhen the two men were pulled apart by the other negroes who were in\r\nthe room drinking, John had not been much wounded but James Herbert\r\nhad gotten one good strong cut that went from-his right shoulder down\r\nacross the front of his whole body. Razor fighting does not wound very\r\ndeeply, but it makes a cut that looks most nasty, for it is so very\r\nbloody.\r\n\r\nHerbert was held by the other negroes until he was cleaned and\r\nplastered, and then he was put to bed to sleep off his drink and\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nThe next day he came to where his wife and daughter lived and he was\r\nfurious.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s that Melanctha, of yours?" he said to his wife, when he saw\r\nher. "If she is to the Bishops\' stables now with that yellow John, I\r\nswear I kill her. A nice way she is going for a decent daughter. Why\r\ndon\'t you see to that girl better you, ain\'t you her mother!"\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert had always been old in all her ways and she knew\r\nvery early how to use her power as a woman, and yet Melanctha with all\r\nher inborn intense wisdom was really very ignorant of evil. Melanctha\r\nhad not yet come to understand what they meant, the things she so\r\noften heard around her, and which were just beginning to stir strongly\r\nin her.\r\n\r\nNow when her father began fiercely to assail her, she did not really\r\nknow what it was that he was so furious to force from her. In every\r\nway that he could think of in his anger, he tried to make her say\r\na thing she did not really know. She held out and never answered\r\nanything he asked her, for Melanctha had a breakneck courage and she\r\njust then badly hated her black father.\r\n\r\nWhen the excitement was all over, Melanctha began to know her power,\r\nthe power she had so often felt stirring within her and which she now\r\nknew she could use to make her stronger.\r\n\r\nJames Herbert did not win this fight with his daughter. After awhile\r\nhe forgot it as he soon forgot John and the cut of his sharp razor.\r\nMelanctha almost forgot to hate her father, in her strong interest in\r\nthe power she now knew she had within her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha did not care much now, any longer, to see John or his wife\r\nor even the fine horses. This life was too quiet and accustomed and no\r\nlonger stirred her to any interest or excitement.\r\n\r\nMelanctha now really was beginning as a woman. She was ready, and she\r\nbegan to search in the streets and in dark corners to discover men and\r\nto learn their natures and their various ways of working.\r\n\r\nIn these next years Melanctha learned many ways that lead to wisdom.\r\nShe learned the ways, and dimly in the distance she saw wisdom. These\r\nyears of learning led very straight to trouble for Melanctha, though\r\nin these years Melanctha never did or meant anything that was really\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nGirls who are brought up with care and watching can always find\r\nmoments to escape into the world, where they may learn the ways that\r\nlead to wisdom. For a girl raised like Melanctha Herbert, such escape\r\nwas always very simple. Often she was alone, sometimes she was with a\r\nfellow seeker, and she strayed and stood, sometimes by railroad yards,\r\nsometimes on the docks or around new buildings where many men were\r\nworking. Then when the darkness covered everything all over, she would\r\nbegin to learn to know this man or that. She would advance, they would\r\nrespond, and then she would withdraw a little, dimly, and always she\r\ndid not know what it was that really held her. Sometimes she would\r\nalmost go over, and then the strength in her of not really knowing,\r\nwould stop the average man in his endeavor. It was a strange\r\nexperience of ignorance and power and desire. Melanctha did not know\r\nwhat it was that she so badly wanted. She was afraid, and yet she did\r\nnot understand that here she really was a coward.\r\n\r\nBoys had never meant much to Melanctha. They had always been too\r\nyoung to content her. Melanctha had a strong respect for any kind of\r\nsuccessful power. It was this that always kept Melanctha nearer, in\r\nher feeling toward her virile and unendurable black father, than she\r\never was in her feeling for her pale yellow, sweet-appearing mother.\r\nThe things she had in her of her mother, never made her feel respect.\r\n\r\nIn these young days, it was only men that for Melanctha held anything\r\nthere was of knowledge and power. It was not from men however that\r\nMelanctha learned to really understand this power.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Melanctha was twelve until she was sixteen she\r\nwandered, always seeking but never more than very dimly seeing wisdom.\r\nAll this time Melanctha went on with her school learning; she went to\r\nschool rather longer than do most of the colored children.\r\n\r\nMelanctha\'s wanderings after wisdom she always had to do in secret and\r\nby snatches, for her mother was then still living and \'Mis\' Herbert\r\nalways did some watching, and Melanctha with all her hard courage\r\ndreaded that there should be much telling to her father, who came now\r\nquite often to where Melanctha lived with her mother.\r\n\r\nIn these days Melanctha talked and stood and walked with many kinds of\r\nmen, but she did not learn to know any of them very deeply. They all\r\nsupposed her to have world knowledge and experience. They, believing\r\nthat she knew all, told her nothing, and thinking that she was\r\ndeciding with them, asked for nothing, and so though Melanctha\r\nwandered widely, she was really very safe with all the wandering.\r\n\r\nIt was a very wonderful experience this safety of Melanctha in these\r\ndays of her attempted learning. Melanctha herself did not feel the\r\nwonder, she only knew that for her it all had no real value.\r\n\r\nMelanctha all her life was very keen in her sense for real experience.\r\nShe knew she was not getting what she so badly wanted, but with all\r\nher break neck courage Melanctha here was a coward, and so she could\r\nnot learn to really understand.\r\n\r\nMelanctha liked to wander, and to stand by the railroad yard, and\r\nwatch the men and the engines and the switches and everything that was\r\nbusy there, working. Railroad yards are a ceaseless fascination. They\r\nsatisfy every kind of nature. For the lazy man whose blood flows very\r\nslowly, it is a steady soothing world of motion which supplies him\r\nwith the sense of a strong moving power. He need not work and yet he\r\nhas it very deeply; he has it even better than the man who works in\r\nit or owns it. Then for natures that like to feel emotion without the\r\ntrouble of having any suffering, it is very nice to get the swelling\r\nin the throat, and the fullness, and the heart beats, and all the\r\nflutter of excitement that comes as one watches the people come and\r\ngo, and hears the engine pound and give a long drawn whistle. For a\r\nchild watching through a hole in the fence above the yard, it is a\r\nwonder world of mystery and movement. The child loves all the noise,\r\nand then it loves the silence of the wind that comes before the full\r\nrush of the pounding train, that bursts out from the tunnel where it\r\nlost itself and all its noise in darkness, and the child loves all the\r\nsmoke, that sometimes comes in rings, and always puffs with fire and\r\nblue color.\r\n\r\nFor Melanctha the yard was full of the excitement of many men, and\r\nperhaps a free and whirling future.\r\n\r\nMelanctha came here very often and watched the men and all the things\r\nthat were so busy working. The men always had time for, "Hullo sis,\r\ndo you want to sit on my engine," and, "Hullo, that\'s a pretty lookin\'\r\nyaller girl, do you want to come and see him cookin."\r\n\r\nAll the colored porters liked Melanctha. They often told her exciting\r\nthings that had happened; how in the West they went through big\r\ntunnels where there was no air to breathe, and then out and winding\r\naround edges of great canyons on thin high spindling trestles, and\r\nsometimes cars, and sometimes whole trains fell from the narrow\r\nbridges, and always up from the dark places death and all kinds of\r\nqueer devils looked up and laughed in their faces. And then they would\r\ntell how sometimes when the train went pounding down steep slippery\r\nmountains, great rocks would racket and roll down around them, and\r\nsometimes would smash in the car and kill men; and as the porters told\r\nthese stories their round, black, shining faces would grow solemn,\r\nand their color would go grey beneath the greasy black, and their eyes\r\nwould roll white in the fear and wonder of the things they could scare\r\nthemselves by telling.\r\n\r\nThere was one, big, serious, melancholy, light brown porter who often\r\ntold Melanctha stories, for he liked the way she had of listening with\r\nintelligence and sympathetic feeling, when he told how the white men\r\nin the far South tried to kill him because he made one of them who was\r\ndrunk and called him a damned nigger, and who refused to pay money for\r\nhis chair to a nigger, get off the train between stations. And then\r\nthis porter had to give up going to that part of the Southern country,\r\nfor all the white men swore that if he ever came there again they\r\nwould surely kill him.\r\n\r\nMelanctha liked this serious, melancholy light brown negro very\r\nwell, and all her life Melanctha wanted and respected gentleness\r\nand goodness, and this man always gave her good advice and serious\r\nkindness, and Melanctha felt such things very deeply, but she could\r\nnever let them help her or affect her to change the ways that always\r\nmade her keep herself in trouble.\r\n\r\nMelanctha spent many of the last hours of the daylight with the\r\nporters and with other men who worked hard, but when darkness came it\r\nwas always different. Then Melanctha would find herself with the,\r\nfor her, gentlemanly classes. A clerk, or a young express agent would\r\nbegin to know her, and they would stand, or perhaps, walk a little\r\nwhile together.\r\n\r\nMelanctha always made herself escape but often it was with an effort.\r\nShe did not know what it was that she so badly wanted, but with all\r\nher courage Melanctha here was a coward, and so she could not learn to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nMelanctha and some man would stand in the evening and would talk\r\ntogether. Sometimes Melanctha would be with another girl and then it\r\nwas much easier to stay or to escape, for then they could make way for\r\nthemselves together, and by throwing words and laughter to each other,\r\ncould keep a man from getting too strong in his attention.\r\n\r\nBut when Melanctha was alone, and she was so, very often, she would\r\nsometimes come very near to making a long step on the road that leads\r\nto wisdom. Some man would learn a good deal about her in the talk,\r\nnever altogether truly, for Melanctha all her life did not know how to\r\ntell a story wholly. She always, and yet not with intention, managed\r\nto leave out big pieces which make a story very different, for when it\r\ncame to what had happened and what she had said and what it was that\r\nshe had really done, Melanctha never could remember right. The man\r\nwould sometimes come a little nearer, would detain her, would hold\r\nher arm or make his jokes a little clearer, and then Melanctha would\r\nalways make herself escape. The man thinking that she really had world\r\nwisdom would not make his meaning clear, and believing that she was\r\ndeciding with him he never went so fast that he could stop her when at\r\nlast she made herself escape.\r\n\r\nAnd so Melanctha wandered on the edge of wisdom. "Say, Sis, why don\'t\r\nyou when you come here stay a little longer?" they would all ask\r\nher, and they would hold her for an answer, and she would laugh,\r\nand sometimes she did stay longer, but always just in time she made\r\nherself escape.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert wanted very much to know and yet she feared the\r\nknowledge. As she grew older she often stayed a good deal longer,\r\nand sometimes it was almost a balanced struggle, but she always made\r\nherself escape.\r\n\r\nNext to the railroad yard it was the shipping docks that Melanctha\r\nloved best when she wandered. Often she was alone, sometimes she was\r\nwith some better kind of black girl, and she would stand a long time\r\nand watch the men working at unloading, and see the steamers do their\r\ncoaling, and she would listen with full feeling to the yowling of the\r\nfree swinging negroes, as they ran, with their powerful loose jointed\r\nbodies and their childish savage yelling, pushing, carrying, pulling\r\ngreat loads from the ships to the warehouses.\r\n\r\nThe men would call out, "Say, Sis, look out or we\'ll come and catch\r\nyer," or "Hi, there, you yaller girl, come here and we\'ll take you\r\nsailin\'." And then, too, Melanctha would learn to know some of the\r\nserious foreign sailors who told her all sorts of wonders, and a cook\r\nwould sometimes take her and her friends over a ship and show where he\r\nmade his messes and where the men slept, and where the shops were, and\r\nhow everything was made by themselves, right there, on ship board.\r\n\r\nMelanctha loved to see these dark and smelly places. She always loved\r\nto watch and talk and listen with men who worked hard. But it was\r\nnever from these rougher people that Melanctha tried to learn the ways\r\nthat lead to wisdom. In the daylight she always liked to talk with\r\nrough men and to listen to their lives and about their work and their\r\nvarious ways of doing, but when the darkness covered everything all\r\nover, Melanctha would meet, and stand, and talk with a clerk or a\r\nyoung shipping agent who had seen her watching, and so it was that she\r\nwould try to learn to understand.\r\n\r\nAnd then Melanctha was fond of watching men work on new buildings. She\r\nloved to see them hoisting, digging, sawing and stone cutting. Here,\r\ntoo, in the daylight, she always learned to know the common workmen.\r\n"Heh, Sis, look out or that rock will fall on you and smash you all\r\nup into little pieces. Do you think you would make a nice jelly?" And\r\nthen they would all laugh and feel that their jokes were very funny.\r\nAnd "Say, you pretty yaller girl, would it scare you bad to stand up\r\nhere on top where I be? See if you\'ve got grit and come up here where\r\nI can hold you. All you got to do is to sit still on that there rock\r\nthat they\'re just hoistin\', and then when you get here I\'ll hold you\r\ntight, don\'t you be scared Sis."\r\n\r\nSometimes Melanctha would do some of these things that had much\r\ndanger, and always with such men, she showed her power and her break\r\nneck courage. Once she slipped and fell from a high place. A workman\r\ncaught her and so she was not killed, but her left arm was badly\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nAll the men crowded around her. They admired her boldness in doing and\r\nin bearing pain when her arm was broken. They all went along with\r\nher with great respect to the doctor, and then they took her home in\r\ntriumph and all of them were bragging about her not squealing.\r\n\r\nJames Herbert was home where his wife lived, that day. He was furious\r\nwhen he saw the workmen and Melanctha. He drove the men away with\r\ncurses so that they were all very nearly fighting, and he would not\r\nlet a doctor come in to attend Melanctha. "Why don\'t you see to that\r\ngirl better, you, you\'re her mother."\r\n\r\nJames Herbert did not fight things out now any more with his daughter.\r\nHe feared her tongue, and her school learning, and the way she had\r\nof saying things that were very nasty to a brutal black man who\r\nknew nothing. And Melanctha just then hated him very badly in her\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nAnd so this was the way Melanctha lived the four years of her\r\nbeginning as a woman. And many things happened to Melanctha, but she\r\nknew very well that none of them had led her on to the right way, that\r\ncertain way that was to lead her to world wisdom.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert was sixteen when she first met Jane Harden. Jane was\r\na negress, but she was so white that hardly any one could guess it.\r\nJane had had a good deal of education. She had been two years at a\r\ncolored college. She had had to leave because of her bad conduct. She\r\ntaught Melanctha many things. She taught her how to go the ways that\r\nlead to wisdom.\r\n\r\nJane Harden was at this time twenty-three years old and she had\r\nhad much experience. She was very much attracted by Melanctha, and\r\nMelanctha was very proud that this Jane would let her know her.\r\n\r\nJane Harden was not afraid to understand. Melanctha who had strong the\r\nsense for real experience, knew that here was a woman who had learned\r\nto understand.\r\n\r\nJane Harden had many bad habits. She drank a great deal, and she\r\nwandered widely. She was safe though now, when she wanted to be safe,\r\nin this wandering.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert soon always wandered with her. Melanctha tried the\r\ndrinking and some of the other habits, but she did not find that she\r\ncared very much to do them. But every day she grew stronger in her\r\ndesire to really understand.\r\n\r\nIt was now no longer, even in the daylight, the rougher men that these\r\ntwo learned to know in their wanderings, and for Melanctha the better\r\nclasses were now a little higher. It was no longer express agents\r\nand clerks that she learned to know, but men in business, commercial\r\ntravelers, and even men above these, and Jane and she would talk and\r\nwalk and laugh and escape from them all very often. It was still the\r\nsame, the knowing of them and the always just escaping, only now for\r\nMelanctha somehow it was different, for though it was always the same\r\nthing that happened it had a different flavor, for now Melanctha was\r\nwith a woman who had wisdom, and dimly she began to see what it was\r\nthat she should understand.\r\n\r\nIt was not from the men that Melanctha learned her wisdom. It\r\nwas always Jane Harden herself who was making Melanctha begin to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nJane was a roughened woman. She had power and she liked to use it, she\r\nhad much white blood and that made her see clear, she liked drinking\r\nand that made her reckless. Her white blood was strong in her and\r\nshe had grit and endurance and a vital courage. She was always game,\r\nhowever much she was in trouble. She liked Melanctha Herbert for the\r\nthings that she had like her, and then Melanctha was young, and\r\nshe had sweetness, and a way of listening with intelligence and\r\nsympathetic interest, to the stories that Jane Harden often told out\r\nof her experience.\r\n\r\nJane grew always fonder of Melanctha. Soon they began to wander,\r\nmore to be together than to see men and learn their various ways of\r\nworking. Then they began not to wander, and Melanctha would spend long\r\nhours with Jane in her room, sitting at her feet and listening to her\r\nstories, and feeling her strength and the power of her affection, and\r\nslowly she began to see clear before her one certain way that would be\r\nsure to lead to wisdom.\r\n\r\nBefore the end came, the end of the two years in which Melanctha spent\r\nall her time when she was not at school or in her home, with Jane\r\nHarden, before these two years were finished, Melanctha had come to\r\nsee very clear, and she had come to be very certain, what it is that\r\ngives the world its wisdom.\r\n\r\nJane Harden always had a little money and she had a room in the lower\r\npart of the town. Jane had once taught in a colored school. She\r\nhad had to leave that too on account of her bad conduct. It was her\r\ndrinking that always made all the trouble for her, for that can never\r\nbe really covered over.\r\n\r\nJane\'s drinking was always growing worse upon her. Melanctha had tried\r\nto do the drinking but it had no real attraction for her.\r\n\r\nIn the first year, between Jane Harden and Melanctha Herbert, Jane had\r\nbeen much the stronger. Jane loved Melanctha and she found her always\r\nintelligent and brave and sweet and docile, and Jane meant to, and\r\nbefore the year was over she had taught Melanctha what it is that\r\ngives many people in the world their wisdom.\r\n\r\nJane had many ways in which to do this teaching. She told Melanctha\r\nmany things. She loved Melanctha hard and made Melanctha feel it\r\nvery deeply. She would be with other people and with men and with\r\nMelanctha, and she would make Melanctha understand what everybody\r\nwanted, and what one did with power when one had it.\r\n\r\nMelanctha sat at Jane\'s feet for many hours in these days and felt\r\nJane\'s wisdom. She learned to love Jane and to have this feeling very\r\ndeeply. She learned a little in these days to know joy, and she was\r\ntaught too how very keenly she could suffer. It was very different\r\nthis suffering from that Melanctha sometimes had from her mother and\r\nfrom her very unendurable black father. Then she was fighting and\r\nshe could be strong and valiant in her suffering, but here with Jane\r\nHarden she was longing and she bent and pleaded with her suffering.\r\n\r\nIt was a very tumultuous, very mingled year, this time for Melanctha,\r\nbut she certainly did begin to really understand.\r\n\r\nIn every way she got it from Jane Harden. There was nothing good or\r\nbad in doing, feeling, thinking or in talking, that Jane spared her.\r\nSometimes the lesson came almost too strong for Melanctha, but\r\nsomehow she always managed to endure it and so slowly, but always with\r\nincreasing strength and feeling, Melanctha began to really understand.\r\n\r\nThen slowly, between them, it began to be all different. Slowly now\r\nbetween them, it was Melanctha Herbert, who was stronger. Slowly now\r\nthey began to drift apart from one another.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert never really lost her sense that it was Jane Harden\r\nwho had taught her, but Jane did many things that Melanctha now no\r\nlonger needed. And then, too, Melanctha never could remember right\r\nwhen it came to what she had done and what had happened. Melanctha now\r\nsometimes quarreled with Jane, and they no longer went about together,\r\nand sometimes Melanctha really forgot how much she owed to Jane\r\nHarden\'s teaching.\r\n\r\nMelanctha began now to feel that she had always had world wisdom. She\r\nreally knew of course, that it was Jane who had taught her, but all\r\nthat began to be covered over by the trouble between them, that was\r\nnow always getting stronger.\r\n\r\nJane Harden was a roughened woman. Once she had been very strong, but\r\nnow she was weakened in all her kinds of strength by her drinking.\r\nMelanctha had tried the drinking but it had had no real attraction for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nJane\'s strong and roughened nature and her drinking made it always\r\nharder for her to forgive Melanctha, that now Melanctha did not really\r\nneed her any longer. Now it was Melanctha who was stronger and it was\r\nJane who was dependent on her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was now come to be about eighteen years old. She was a\r\ngraceful, pale yellow, good looking, intelligent, attractive negress,\r\na little mysterious sometimes in her ways, and always good and\r\npleasant, and always ready to do things for people.\r\n\r\nMelanctha from now on saw very little of Jane Harden. Jane did not\r\nlike that very well and sometimes she abused Melanctha, but her\r\ndrinking soon covered everything all over.\r\n\r\nIt was not in Melanctha\'s nature to really lose her sense for Jane\r\nHarden. Melanctha all her life was ready to help Jane out in any of\r\nher trouble, and later, when Jane really went to pieces, Melanctha\r\nalways did all that she could to help her.\r\n\r\nBut Melanctha Herbert was ready now herself to do teaching. Melanctha\r\ncould do anything now that she wanted. Melanctha knew now what\r\neverybody wanted.\r\n\r\nMelanctha had learned how she might stay a little longer; she had\r\nlearned that she must decide when she wanted really to stay longer,\r\nand she had learned how when she wanted to, she could escape.\r\n\r\nAnd so Melanctha began once more to wander. It was all now for her\r\nvery different. It was never rougher men now that she talked to, and\r\nshe did not care much now to know white men of the, for her, very\r\nbetter classes. It was now something realler that Melanctha wanted,\r\nsomething that would move her very deeply, something that would fill\r\nher fully with the wisdom that was planted now within her, and that\r\nshe wanted badly, should really wholly fill her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha these days wandered very widely. She was always alone now\r\nwhen she wandered. Melanctha did not need help now to know, or to stay\r\nlonger, or when she wanted, to escape.\r\n\r\nMelanctha tried a great many men, in these days before she was really\r\nsuited. It was almost a year that she wandered and then she met with\r\na young mulatto. He was a doctor who had just begun to practice. He\r\nwould most likely do well in the future, but it was not this that\r\nconcerned Melanctha. She found him good and strong and gentle and very\r\nintellectual, and all her life Melanctha liked and wanted good and\r\nconsiderate people, and then too he did not at first believe in\r\nMelanctha. He held off and did not know what it was that Melanctha\r\nwanted. Melanctha came to want him very badly. They began to know each\r\nother better. Things began to be very strong between them. Melanctha\r\nwanted him so badly that now she never wandered. She just gave herself\r\nto this experience.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert was now, all alone, in Bridgepoint. She lived now\r\nwith this colored woman and now with that one, and she sewed, and\r\nsometimes she taught a little in a colored school as substitute for\r\nsome teacher. Melanctha had now no home nor any regular employment.\r\nLife was just commencing for Melanctha. She had youth and had learned\r\nwisdom, and she was graceful and pale yellow and very pleasant, and\r\nalways ready to do things for people, and she was mysterious in her\r\nways and that only made belief in her more fervent.\r\n\r\nDuring the year before she met Jefferson Campbell, Melanctha had tried\r\nmany kinds of men but they had none of them interested Melanctha very\r\ndeeply. She met them, she was much with them, she left them, she would\r\nthink perhaps this next time it would be more exciting, and always\r\nshe found that for her it all had no real meaning. She could now do\r\neverything she wanted, she knew now everything that everybody wanted,\r\nand yet it all had no excitement for her. With these men, she knew\r\nshe could learn nothing. She wanted some one that could teach her very\r\ndeeply and now at last she was sure that she had found him, yes she\r\nreally had it, before she had thought to look if in this man she would\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\nDuring this year \'Mis\' Herbert as her neighbors called her,\r\nMelanctha\'s pale yellow mother was very sick, and in this year she\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nMelanctha\'s father during these last years did not come very often to\r\nthe house where his wife lived and Melanctha. Melanctha was not\r\nsure that her father was now any longer here in Bridgepoint. It\r\nwas Melanctha who was very good now to her mother. It was always\r\nMelanctha\'s way to be good to any one in trouble.\r\n\r\nMelanctha took good care of her mother. She did everything that any\r\nwoman could, she tended and soothed and helped her pale yellow mother,\r\nand she worked hard in every way to take care of her, and make her\r\ndying easy. But Melanctha did not in these days like her mother any\r\nbetter, and her mother never cared much for this daughter who was\r\nalways a hard child to manage, and who had a tongue that always could\r\nbe very nasty.\r\n\r\nMelanctha did everything that any woman could, and at last her mother\r\ndied, and Melanctha had her buried. Melanctha\'s father was not heard\r\nfrom, and Melanctha in all her life after, never saw or heard or knew\r\nof anything that her father did.\r\n\r\nIt was the young doctor, Jefferson Campbell, who helped Melanctha\r\ntoward the end, to take care of her sick mother. Jefferson Campbell\r\nhad often before seen Melanctha Herbert, but he had never liked her\r\nvery well, and he had never believed that she was any good. He had\r\nheard something about how she wandered. He knew a little too of Jane\r\nHarden, and he was sure that this Melanctha Herbert, who was her\r\nfriend and who wandered, would never come to any good.\r\n\r\nDr. Jefferson Campbell was a serious, earnest, good young joyous\r\ndoctor. He liked to take care of everybody and he loved his own\r\ncolored people. He always found life very easy did Jeff Campbell, and\r\neverybody liked to have him with them. He was so good and sympathetic,\r\nand he was so earnest and so joyous. He sang when he was happy, and he\r\nlaughed, and his was the free abandoned laughter that gives the warm\r\nbroad glow to negro sunshine.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell had never yet in his life had real trouble. Jefferson\'s\r\nfather was a good, kind, serious, religious man. He was a very steady,\r\nvery intelligent, and very dignified, light brown, grey haired negro.\r\nHe was a butler and he had worked for the Campbell family many years,\r\nand his father and his mother before him had been in the service of\r\nthis family as free people.\r\n\r\nJefferson Campbell\'s father and his mother had of course been\r\nregularly married. Jefferson\'s mother was a sweet, little, pale brown,\r\ngentle woman who reverenced and obeyed her good husband, and who\r\nworshipped and admired and loved hard her-good, earnest, cheery, hard\r\nworking doctor boy who was her only child.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell had been raised religious by his people but religion had\r\nnever interested Jeff very much. Jefferson was very good. He loved\r\nhis people and he never hurt them, and he always did everything they\r\nwanted and that he could to please them, but he really loved best\r\nscience and experimenting and to learn things, and he early wanted\r\nto be a doctor, and he was always very interested in the life of the\r\ncolored people.\r\n\r\nThe Campbell family had been very good to him and had helped him\r\non with his ambition. Jefferson studied hard, he went to a colored\r\ncollege, and then he learnt to be a doctor.\r\n\r\nIt was now two or three years, that he had started in to practice.\r\nEverybody liked Jeff Campbell, he was so strong and kindly and\r\ncheerful and understanding, and he laughed so with pure joy, and he\r\nalways liked to help all his own colored people.\r\n\r\nDr. Jeff knew all about Jane Harden. He had taken care of her in some\r\nof her bad trouble. He knew about Melanctha too, though until her\r\nmother was taken sick he had never met her. Then he was called in to\r\nhelp Melanctha to take care of her sick mother. Dr. Campbell did not\r\nlike Melanctha\'s ways and he did not think that she would ever come to\r\nany good.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell had taken care of Jane Harden in some of her bad trouble.\r\nJane sometimes had abused Melanctha to him. What right had that\r\nMelanctha Herbert who owed everything to her, Jane Harden, what\r\nright had a girl like that to go away to other men and leave her,\r\nbut Melanctha Herbert never had any sense of how to act to anybody.\r\nMelanctha had a good mind, Jane never denied her that, but she never\r\nused it to do anything decent with it. But what could you expect when\r\nMelanctha had such a brute of a black nigger father, and Melanctha was\r\nalways abusing her father and yet she was just like him, and really\r\nshe admired him so much and he never had any sense of what he owed to\r\nanybody, and Melanctha was just like him and she was proud of it too,\r\nand it made Jane so tired to hear Melanctha talk all the time as if\r\nshe wasn\'t. Jane Harden hated people who had good minds and didn\'t use\r\nthem, and Melanctha always had that weakness, and wanting to keep in\r\nwith people, and never really saying that she wanted to be like her\r\nfather, and it was so silly of Melanctha to abuse her father, when she\r\nwas so much like him and she really liked it. No, Jane Harden had no\r\nuse for Melanctha. Oh yes, Melanctha always came around to be good to\r\nher. Melanctha was always sure to do that. She never really went away\r\nand left one. She didn\'t use her mind enough to do things straight out\r\nlike that. Melanctha Herbert had a good mind, Jane never denied that\r\nto her, but she never wanted to see or hear about Melanctha Herbert\r\nany more, and she wished Melanctha wouldn\'t come in any more to see\r\nher. She didn\'t hate her, but she didn\'t want to hear about her father\r\nand all that talk Melanctha always made, and that just meant nothing\r\nto her. Jane Harden was very tired of all that now. She didn\'t have\r\nany use now any more for Melanctha, and if Dr. Campbell saw her he\r\nbetter tell her Jane didn\'t want to see her, and she could take her\r\ntalk to somebody else, who was ready to believe her. And then Jane\r\nHarden would drop away and forget Melanctha and all her life before,\r\nand then she would begin to drink and so she would cover everything\r\nall over.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell heard all this very often, but it did not interest him\r\nvery deeply. He felt no desire to know more of this Melanctha. He\r\nheard her, once, talking to another girl outside of the house, when\r\nhe was paying a visit to Jane Harden. He did not see much in the talk\r\nthat he heard her do. He did not see much in the things Jane Harden\r\nsaid when she abused Melanctha to him. He was more interested in Jane\r\nherself than in anything he heard about Melanctha. He knew Jane Harden\r\nhad a good mind, and she had had power, and she could really have\r\ndone things, and now this drinking covered everything all over. Jeff\r\nCampbell was always very sorry when he had to see it. Jane Harden was\r\na roughened woman, and yet Jeff found a great many strong good things\r\nin her, that still made him like her.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell did everything he could for Jane Harden. He did not care\r\nmuch to hear about Melanctha. He had no feeling, much, about her. He\r\ndid not find that he took any interest in her. Jane Harden was so much\r\na stronger woman, and Jane really had had a good mind, and she had\r\nused it to do things with it, before this drinking business had taken\r\nsuch a hold upon her.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell was helping Melanctha Herbert to take care of her sick\r\nmother. He saw Melanctha now for long times and very often, and\r\nthey sometimes talked a good deal together, but Melanctha never said\r\nanything to him about Jane Harden. She never talked to him about\r\nanything that was not just general matters, or about medicine, or\r\nto tell him funny stories. She asked him many questions and always\r\nlistened very well to all he told her, and she always remembered\r\neverything she heard him say about doctoring, and she always\r\nremembered everything that she had learned from all the others.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell never found that all this talk interested him very\r\ndeeply. He did not find that he liked Melanctha when he saw her so\r\nmuch, any better. He never found that he thought much about Melanctha.\r\nHe never found that he believed much in her having a good mind, like\r\nJane Harden. He found he liked Jane Harden always better, and that he\r\nwished very much that she had never begun that bad drinking.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert\'s mother was now always getting sicker. Melanctha\r\nreally did everything that any woman could. Melanctha\'s mother never\r\nliked her daughter any better. She never said much, did \'Mis\' Herbert,\r\nbut anybody could see that she did not think much of this daughter.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell now often had to stay a long time to take care of \'Mis\'\r\nHerbert. One day \'Mis\' Herbert was much sicker and Dr. Campbell\r\nthought that this night, she would surely die. He came back late to\r\nthe house, as he had said he would, to sit up and watch \'Mis\' Herbert,\r\nand to help Melanctha, if she should need anybody to be with her.\r\nMelanctha Herbert and Jeff Campbell sat up all that night together.\r\n\'Mis\' Herbert did not die. The next day she was a little better.\r\n\r\nThis house where Melanctha had always lived with her mother was a\r\nlittle red brick, two story house. They had not much furniture to fill\r\nit and some of the windows were broken and not mended. Melanctha did\r\nnot have much money to use now on the house, but with a colored woman,\r\nwho was their neighbor and good natured and who had always helped\r\nthem, Melanctha managed to take care of her mother and to keep the\r\nhouse fairly clean and neat.\r\n\r\nMelanctha\'s mother was in bed in a room upstairs, and the steps from\r\nbelow led right up into it. There were just two rooms on this upstairs\r\nfloor. Melanctha and Dr. Campbell sat down on the steps, that night\r\nthey watched together, so that they could hear and see Melanctha\'s\r\nmother and yet the light would be shaded, and they could sit and\r\nread, if they wanted to, and talk low some, and yet not disturb \'Mis\'\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell was always very fond of reading. Dr. Campbell had not\r\nbrought a book with him that night. He had just forgotten it. He had\r\nmeant to put something in his pocket to read, so that he could amuse\r\nhimself, while he was sitting there and watching. When he was through\r\nwith taking care of \'Mis\' Herbert, he came and sat down on the steps\r\njust above where Melanctha was sitting. He spoke about how he had\r\nforgotten to bring his book with him. Melanctha said there were some\r\nold papers in the house, perhaps Dr. Campbell could find something in\r\nthem that would help pass the time for a while for him. All right,\r\nDr. Campbell said, that would be better than just sitting there\r\nwith nothing. Dr. Campbell began to read through the old papers that\r\nMelanctha gave him. When anything amused him in them, he read it out\r\nto Melanctha. Melanctha was now pretty silent, with him. Dr. Campbell\r\nbegan to feel a little, about how she responded to him. Dr. Campbell\r\nbegan to see a little that perhaps Melanctha had a good mind. Dr.\r\nCampbell was not sure yet that she had a good mind, but he began to\r\nthink a little that perhaps she might have one.\r\n\r\nJefferson Campbell always liked to talk to everybody about the things\r\nhe worked at and about his thinking about what he could do for the\r\ncolored people. Melanctha Herbert never thought about these things the\r\nway that he did. Melanctha had never said much to Dr. Campbell about\r\nwhat she thought about them. Melanctha did not feel the same as he did\r\nabout being good and regular in life, and not having excitements\r\nall the time, which was the way that Jefferson Campbell wanted that\r\neverybody should be, so that everybody would be wise and yet be happy.\r\nMelanctha always had strong the sense for real experience. Melanctha\r\nHerbert did not think much of this way of coming to real wisdom.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell soon got through with his reading, in the old newspapers,\r\nand then somehow he began to talk along about the things he was\r\nalways thinking. Dr. Campbell said he wanted to work so that he could\r\nunderstand what troubled people, and not to just have excitements, and\r\nhe believed you ought to love your father and your mother and to be\r\nregular in all your life, and not to be always wanting new things and\r\nexcitements, and to always know where you were, and what you wanted,\r\nand to always tell everything just as you meant it. That\'s the only\r\nkind of life he knew or believed in, Jeff Campbell repeated. "No I\r\nain\'t got any use for all the time being in excitements and wanting to\r\nhave all kinds of experience all the time. I got plenty of experience\r\njust living regular and quiet and with my family, and doing my work,\r\nand taking care of people, and trying to understand it. I don\'t\r\nbelieve much in this running around business and I don\'t want to see\r\nthe colored people do it. I am a colored man and I ain\'t sorry, and I\r\nwant to see the colored people like what is good and what I want\r\nthem to have, and that\'s to live regular and work hard and understand\r\nthings, and that\'s enough to keep any decent man excited." Jeff\r\nCampbell spoke now with some anger. Not to Melanctha, he did not think\r\nof her at all when he was talking. It was the life he wanted that he\r\nspoke to, and the way he wanted things to be with the colored people.\r\n\r\nBut Melanctha Herbert had listened to him say all this. She knew he\r\nmeant it, but it did not mean much to her, and she was sure some day\r\nhe would find out, that it was not all, of real wisdom. Melanctha\r\nknew very well what it was to have real wisdom. "But how about Jane\r\nHarden?" said Melanctha to Jeff Campbell, "seems to me Dr. Campbell\r\nyou find her to have something in her, and you go there very often,\r\nand you talk to her much more than you do to the nice girls that stay\r\nat home with their people, the kind you say you are really wanting. It\r\ndon\'t seem to me Dr. Campbell, that what you say and what you do seem\r\nto have much to do with each other. And about your being so good Dr.\r\nCampbell," went on Melanctha, "You don\'t care about going to church\r\nmuch yourself, and yet you always are saying you believe so much in\r\nthings like that, for people. It seems to me, Dr. Campbell you want\r\nto have a good time just like all us others, and then you just keep\r\non saying that it\'s right to be good and you ought not to have\r\nexcitements, and yet you really don\'t want to do it Dr. Campbell, no\r\nmore than me or Jane Harden. No, Dr. Campbell, it certainly does seem\r\nto me you don\'t know very well yourself, what you mean, when you are\r\ntalking."\r\n\r\nJefferson had been talking right along, the way he always did when he\r\ngot started, and now Melanctha\'s answer only made him talk a little\r\nharder. He laughed a little, too, but very low, so as not to disturb\r\n\'Mis\' Herbert who was sleeping very nicely, and he looked brightly at\r\nMelanctha to enjoy her, and then he settled himself down to answer.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he began, "it certainly does sound a little like I didn\'t\r\nknow very well what I do mean, when you put it like that to me, Miss\r\nMelanctha, but that\'s just because you don\'t understand enough about\r\nwhat I meant, by what I was just saying to you. I don\'t say, never,\r\nI don\'t want to know all kinds of people, Miss Melanctha, and I don\'t\r\nsay there ain\'t many kinds of people, and I don\'t say ever, that I\r\ndon\'t find some like Jane Harden very good to know and talk to, but\r\nit\'s the strong things I like in Jane Harden, not all her excitements.\r\nI don\'t admire the bad things she does, Miss Melanctha, but Jane\r\nHarden is a strong woman and I always respect that in her. No I know\r\nyou don\'t believe what I say, Miss Melanctha, but I mean it, and it\'s\r\nall just because you don\'t understand it when I say it. And as for\r\nreligion, that just ain\'t my way of being good, Miss Melanctha, but\r\nit\'s a good way for many people to be good and regular in their way\r\nof living, and if they believe it, it helps them to be good, and if\r\nthey\'re honest in it, I like to see them have it. No, what I don\'t\r\nlike, Miss Melanctha, is this what I see so much with the colored\r\npeople, their always wanting new things just to get excited."\r\n\r\nJefferson Campbell here stopped himself in this talking. Melanctha\r\nHerbert did not make any answer. They both sat there very quiet.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell then began again on the old papers. He sat there on the\r\nsteps just above where Melanctha was sitting, and he went on with his\r\nreading, and his head went moving up and down, and sometimes he was\r\nreading, and sometimes he was thinking about all the things he wanted\r\nto be doing, and then he would rub the back of his dark hand over\r\nhis mouth, and in between he would be frowning with his thinking, and\r\nsometimes he would be rubbing his head hard to help his thinking. And\r\nMelanctha just sat still and watched the lamp burning, and sometimes\r\nshe turned it down a little, when the wind caught it and it would\r\nbegin to get to smoking.\r\n\r\nAnd so Jeff Campbell and Melanctha Herbert sat there on the steps,\r\nvery quiet, a long time, and they didn\'t seem to think much, that they\r\nwere together. They sat there so, for about an hour, and then it came\r\nto Jefferson very slowly and as a strong feeling that he was sitting\r\nthere on the steps, alone, with Melanctha. He did not know if\r\nMelanctha Herbert was feeling very much about their being there alone\r\ntogether. Jefferson began to wonder about it a little. Slowly he felt\r\nthat surely they must both have this feeling. It was so important that\r\nhe knew that she must have it. They both sat there, very quiet, a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAt last Jefferson began to talk about how the lamp was smelling.\r\nJefferson began to explain what it is that makes a lamp get to\r\nsmelling. Melanctha let him talk. She did not answer, and then he\r\nstopped in his talking. Soon Melanctha began to sit up straighter and\r\nthen she started in to question.\r\n\r\n"About what you was just saying Dr. Campbell about living regular and\r\nall that, I certainly don\'t understand what you meant by what you was\r\njust saying. You ain\'t a bit like good people Dr. Campbell, like\r\nthe good people you are always saying are just like you. I know good\r\npeople Dr. Campbell, and you ain\'t a bit like men who are good and\r\ngot religion. You are just as free and easy as any man can be Dr.\r\nCampbell, and you always like to be with Jane Harden, and she is a\r\npretty bad one and you don\'t look down on her and you never tell her\r\nshe is a bad one. I know you like her just like a friend Dr. Campbell,\r\nand so I certainly don\'t understand just what it is you mean by all\r\nthat you was just saying to me. I know you mean honest Dr. Campbell,\r\nand I am always trying to believe you, but I can\'t say as I see just\r\nwhat you mean when you say you want to be good and real pious, because\r\nI am very certain Dr. Campbell that you ain\'t that kind of a man at\r\nall, and you ain\'t never ashamed to be with queer folks Dr. Campbell,\r\nand you seem to be thinking what you are doing is just like what you\r\nare always saying, and Dr. Campbell, I certainly don\'t just see what\r\nyou mean by what you say."\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell almost laughed loud enough to wake \'Mis\' Herbert. He did\r\nenjoy the way Melanctha said these things to him. He began to feel\r\nvery strongly about it that perhaps Melanctha really had a good mind.\r\nHe was very free now in his laughing, but not so as to make Melanctha\r\nangry. He was very friendly with her in his laughing, and then he\r\nmade his face get serious, and he rubbed his head to help him in his\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n"I know Miss Melanctha" he began, "It ain\'t very easy for you to\r\nunderstand what I was meaning by what I was just saying to you, and\r\nperhaps some of the good people I like so wouldn\'t think very much,\r\nany more than you do, Miss Melanctha, about the ways I have to be\r\ngood. But that\'s no matter Miss Melanctha. What I mean Miss Melanctha\r\nby what I was just saying to you is, that I don\'t, no, never, believe\r\nin doing things just to get excited. You see Miss Melanctha I mean the\r\nway so many of the colored people do it. Instead of just working hard\r\nand caring about their working and living regular with their families\r\nand saving up all their money, so they will have some to bring up\r\ntheir children better, instead of living regular and doing like that\r\nand getting all their new ways from just decent living, the colored\r\npeople just keep running around and perhaps drinking and doing\r\neverything bad they can ever think of, and not just because they like\r\nall those bad things that they are always doing, but only just because\r\nthey want to get excited. No Miss Melanctha, you see I am a colored\r\nman myself and I ain\'t sorry, and I want to see the colored people\r\nbeing good and careful and always honest and living always just\r\nas regular as can be, and I am sure Miss Melanctha, that that way\r\neverybody can have a good time, and be happy and keep right and be\r\nbusy, and not always have to be doing bad things for new ways to get\r\nexcited. Yes Miss Melanctha, I certainly do like everything to be\r\ngood, and quiet, and I certainly do think that is the best way for all\r\nus colored people. No, Miss Melanctha too, I don\'t mean this except\r\nonly just the way I say it. I ain\'t got any other meaning Miss\r\nMelanctha, and it\'s that what I mean when I am saying about being\r\nreally good. It ain\'t Miss Melanctha to be pious and not liking every\r\nkind of people, and I don\'t say ever Miss Melanctha that when other\r\nkind of people come regular into your life you shouldn\'t want to know\r\nthem always. What I mean Miss Melanctha by what I am always saying\r\nis, you shouldn\'t try to know everybody just to run around and get\r\nexcited. It\'s that kind of way of doing that I hate so always Miss\r\nMelanctha, and that is so bad for all us colored people. I don\'t know\r\nas you understand now any better what I mean by what I was just saying\r\nto you. But you certainly do know now Miss Melanctha, that I always\r\nmean it what I say when I am talking."\r\n\r\n"Yes I certainly do understand you when you talk so Dr. Campbell.\r\nI certainly do understand now what you mean by what you was always\r\nsaying to me. I certainly do understand Dr. Campbell that you mean you\r\ndon\'t believe it\'s right to love anybody." "Why sure no, yes I do Miss\r\nMelanctha, I certainly do believe strong in loving, and in being good\r\nto everybody, and trying to understand what they all need, to help\r\nthem." "Oh I know all about that way of doing Dr. Campbell, but that\r\ncertainly ain\'t the kind of love I mean when I am talking. I mean\r\nreal, strong, hot love Dr. Campbell, that makes you do anything for\r\nsomebody that loves you." "I don\'t know much about that kind of\r\nlove yet Miss Melanctha. You see it\'s this way with me always Miss\r\nMelanctha. I am always so busy with my thinking about my work I am\r\ndoing and so I don\'t have time for just fooling, and then too, you see\r\nMiss Melanctha, I really certainly don\'t ever like to get excited, and\r\nthat kind of loving hard does seem always to mean just getting all the\r\ntime excited. That certainly is what I always think from what I see of\r\nthem that have it bad Miss Melanctha, and that certainly would never\r\nsuit a man like me. You see Miss Melanctha I am a very quiet kind of\r\nfellow, and I believe in a quiet life for all the colored people. No\r\nMiss Melanctha I certainly never have mixed myself up in that kind of\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"Yes I certainly do see that very clear Dr. Campbell," said Melanctha,\r\n"I see that\'s certainly what it is always made me not know right about\r\nyou and that\'s certainly what it is that makes you really mean what\r\nyou was always saying. You certainly are just too scared Dr. Campbell\r\nto really feel things way down in you. All you are always wanting Dr.\r\nCampbell, is just to talk about being good, and to play with people\r\njust to have a good time, and yet always to certainly keep yourself\r\nout of trouble. It don\'t seem to me Dr. Campbell that I admire that\r\nway to do things very much. It certainly ain\'t really to me being very\r\ngood. It certainly ain\'t any more to me Dr. Campbell, but that you\r\ncertainly are awful scared about really feeling things way down in\r\nyou, and that\'s certainly the only way Dr. Campbell I can see that you\r\ncan mean, by what it is that you are always saying to me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that Miss Melanctha, I certainly don\'t think I\r\ncan\'t feel things very deep in me, though I do say I certainly do like\r\nto have things nice and quiet, but I don\'t see harm in keeping out of\r\ndanger Miss Melanctha, when a man knows he certainly don\'t want to get\r\nkilled in it, and I don\'t know anything that\'s more awful dangerous\r\nMiss Melanctha than being strong in love with somebody. I don\'t\r\nmind sickness or real trouble Miss Melanctha, and I don\'t want to be\r\ntalking about what I can do in real trouble, but you know something\r\nabout that Miss Melanctha, but I certainly don\'t see much in mixing up\r\njust to get excited, in that awful kind of danger. No Miss Melanctha\r\nI certainly do only know just two kinds of ways of loving. One kind of\r\nloving seems to me, is like one has a good quiet feeling in a family\r\nwhen one does his work, and is always living good and being regular,\r\nand then the other way of loving is just like having it like any\r\nanimal that\'s low in the streets together, and that don\'t seem to me\r\nvery good Miss Melanctha, though I don\'t say ever that it\'s not all\r\nright when anybody likes it, and that\'s all the kinds of love I know\r\nMiss Melanctha, and I certainly don\'t care very much to get mixed up\r\nin that kind of a way just to be in trouble."\r\n\r\nJefferson stopped and Melanctha thought a little.\r\n\r\n"That certainly does explain to me Dr. Campbell what I been thinking\r\nabout you this long time. I certainly did wonder how you could be so\r\nlive, and knowing everything, and everybody, and talking so big always\r\nabout everything, and everybody always liking you so much, and you\r\nalways looking as if you was thinking, and yet you really was\r\nnever knowing about anybody and certainly not being really very\r\nunderstanding. It certainly is all Dr. Campbell because you is so\r\nafraid you will be losing being good so easy, and it certainly do seem\r\nto me Dr. Campbell that it certainly don\'t amount to very much that\r\nkind of goodness."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you are right Miss Melanctha," Jefferson answered. "I don\'t\r\nsay never, perhaps you ain\'t right Miss Melanctha. Perhaps I ought\r\nto know more about such ways Miss Melanctha. Perhaps it would help me\r\nsome, taking care of the colored people, Miss Melanctha. I don\'t say,\r\nno, never, but perhaps I could learn a whole lot about women the right\r\nway, if I had a real good teacher."\r\n\r\n\'Mis\' Herbert just then stirred a little in her sleep. Melanctha went\r\nup the steps to the bed to attend her. Dr. Campbell got up too and\r\nwent to help her. \'Mis\' Herbert woke up and was a little better. Now\r\nit was morning and Dr. Campbell gave his directions to Melanctha, and\r\nthen left her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert all her life long, loved and wanted good, kind\r\nand considerate people. Jefferson Campbell was all the things that\r\nMelanctha had ever wanted. Jefferson was a strong, well built, good\r\nlooking, cheery, intelligent and good mulatto. And then at first he\r\nhad not cared to know Melanctha, and when he did begin to know her\r\nhe had not liked her very well, and he had not thought that she would\r\never come to any good. And then Jefferson Campbell was so very gentle.\r\nJefferson never did some things like other men, things that now were\r\nbeginning to be ugly, for Melanctha. And then too Jefferson Campbell\r\ndid not seem to know very well what it was that Melanctha really\r\nwanted, and all this was making Melanctha feel his power with her\r\nalways getting stronger.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell came in every day to see \'Mis\' Herbert. \'Mis\' Herbert,\r\nafter that night they watched together, did get a little better, but\r\n\'Mis\' Herbert was really very sick, and soon it was pretty sure that\r\nshe would have to die. Melanctha certainly did everything, all the\r\ntime, that any woman could. Jefferson never thought much better of\r\nMelanctha while she did it. It was not her being good, he wanted to\r\nfind in her. He knew very well Jane Harden was right, when she said\r\nMelanctha was always being good to everybody but that that did not\r\nmake Melanctha any better for her. Then too, \'Mis\' Herbert never\r\nliked Melanctha any better, even on the last day of her living, and so\r\nJefferson really never thought much of Melanctha\'s always being good\r\nto her mother.\r\n\r\nJefferson and Melanctha now saw each other, very often. They now\r\nalways liked to be with each other, and they always now had a good\r\ntime when they talked to one another. They, mostly in their talking to\r\neach other, still just talked about outside things and what they were\r\nthinking. Except just in little moments, and not those very often,\r\nthey never said anything about their feeling. Sometimes Melanctha\r\nwould tease Jefferson a little just to show she had not forgotten, but\r\nmostly she listened to his talking, for Jefferson still always liked\r\nto talk along about the things he believed in. Melanctha was liking\r\nJefferson Campbell better every day, and Jefferson was beginning to\r\nknow that Melanctha certainly had a good mind, and he was beginning\r\nto feel a little her real sweetness. Not in her being good to \'Mis\'\r\nHerbert, that never seemed to Jefferson to mean much in her, but there\r\nwas a strong kind of sweetness in Melanctha\'s nature that Jefferson\r\nbegan now to feel when he was with her.\r\n\r\n\'Mis\' Herbert was now always getting sicker. One night again Dr.\r\nCampbell felt very certain that before it was morning she would surely\r\ndie. Dr. Campbell said he would come back to help Melanctha watch her,\r\nand to do anything he could to make \'Mis\' Herbert\'s dying more easy\r\nfor her. Dr. Campbell came back that evening, after he was through\r\nwith his other patients, and then he made \'Mis\' Herbert easy, and\r\nthen he came and sat down on the steps just above where Melanctha was\r\nsitting with the lamp, and looking very tired. Dr. Campbell was pretty\r\ntired too, and they both sat there very quiet.\r\n\r\n"You look awful tired to-night, Dr. Campbell," Melanctha said at last,\r\nwith her voice low and very gentle, "Don\'t you want to go lie down and\r\nsleep a little? You\'re always being much too good to everybody, Dr.\r\nCampbell. I like to have you stay here watching to-night with me, but\r\nit don\'t seem right you ought to stay here when you got so much always\r\nto do for everybody. You are certainly very kind to come back, Dr.\r\nCampbell, but I can certainly get along to-night without you. I can\r\nget help next door sure if I need it. You just go \'long home to bed,\r\nDr. Campbell. You certainly do look as if you need it."\r\n\r\nJefferson was silent for some time, and always he was looking very\r\ngently at Melanctha.\r\n\r\n"I certainly never did think, Miss Melanctha, I would find you to be\r\nso sweet and thinking, with me." "Dr. Campbell" said Melanctha, still\r\nmore gentle, "I certainly never did think that you would ever feel it\r\ngood to like me. I certainly never did think you would want to see for\r\nyourself if I had sweet ways in me."\r\n\r\nThey both sat there very tired, very gentle, very quiet, a long time.\r\nAt last Melanctha in a low, even tone began to talk to Jefferson\r\nCampbell.\r\n\r\n"You are certainly a very good man, Dr. Campbell, I certainly do feel\r\nthat more every day I see you. Dr. Campbell, I sure do want to be\r\nfriends with a good man like you, now I know you. You certainly, Dr.\r\nCampbell, never do things like other men, that\'s always ugly for me.\r\nTell me true, Dr. Campbell, how you feel about being always friends\r\nwith me. I certainly do know, Dr. Campbell, you are a good man, and if\r\nyou say you will be friends with me, you certainly never will go back\r\non me, the way so many kinds of them do to every girl they ever get\r\nto like them. Tell me for true, Dr. Campbell, will you be friends with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Why, Miss Melanctha," said Campbell slowly, "why you see I just can\'t\r\nsay that right out that way to you. Why sure you know Miss Melanctha,\r\nI will be very glad if it comes by and by that we are always\r\nfriends together, but you see, Miss Melanctha, I certainly am a very\r\nslow-minded quiet kind of fellow though I do say quick things all the\r\ntime to everybody, and when I certainly do want to mean it what I am\r\nsaying to you, I can\'t say things like that right out to everybody\r\ntill I know really more for certain all about you, and how I like you,\r\nand what I really mean to do better for you. You certainly do see what\r\nI mean, Miss Melanctha." "I certainly do admire you for talking honest\r\nto me, Jeff Campbell," said Melanctha. "Oh, I am always honest,\r\nMiss Melanctha. It\'s easy enough for me always to be honest, Miss\r\nMelanctha. All I got to do is always just to say right out what I am\r\nthinking. I certainly never have got any real reason for not saying it\r\nright out like that to anybody."\r\n\r\nThey sat together, very silent. "I certainly do wonder, Miss\r\nMelanctha," at last began Jeff Campbell, "I certainly do wonder, if\r\nwe know very right, you and me, what each other is really thinking.\r\nI certainly do wonder, Miss Melanctha, if we know at all really what\r\neach other means by what we are always saying." "That certainly do\r\nmean, by what you say, that you think I am a bad one, Jeff Campbell,"\r\nflashed out Melanctha. "Why no, Miss Melanctha, why sure I don\'t mean\r\nany thing like that at all, by what I am saying to you. You know well\r\nas I do, Miss Melanctha, I think better of you every day I see you,\r\nand I like to talk with you all the time now, Miss Melanctha, and I\r\ncertainly do think we both like it very well when we are together,\r\nand it seems to me always more, you are very good and sweet always\r\nto everybody. It only is, I am really so slow-minded in my ways, Miss\r\nMelanctha, for all I talk so quick to everybody, and I don\'t like to\r\nsay to you what I don\'t know for very sure, and I certainly don\'t know\r\nfor sure I know just all what you mean by what you are always saying\r\nto me. And you see, Miss Melanctha, that\'s what makes me say what I\r\nwas just saying to you when you asked me."\r\n\r\n"I certainly do thank you again for being honest to me, Dr. Campbell,"\r\nsaid Melanctha. "I guess I leave you now, Dr. Campbell. I think I go\r\nin the other room and rest a little. I leave you here, so perhaps if I\r\nain\'t here you will maybe sleep and rest yourself a little. Good night\r\nnow, Dr. Campbell, I call you if I need you later to help me, Dr.\r\nCampbell, I hope you rest well, Dr. Campbell."\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell, when Melanctha left him, sat there and he was very\r\nquiet and just wondered. He did not know very well just what Melanctha\r\nmeant by what she was always saying to him. He did not know very well\r\nhow much he really knew about Melanctha Herbert. He wondered if he\r\nshould go on being so much all the time with her. He began to think\r\nabout what he should do now with her. Jefferson Campbell was a man who\r\nliked everybody and many people liked very much to be with him.\r\nWomen liked him, he was so strong, and good, and understanding, and\r\ninnocent, and firm, and gentle. Sometimes they seemed to want very\r\nmuch he should be with them. When they got so, they always had made\r\nCampbell very tired. Sometimes he would play a little with them,\r\nbut he never had had any strong feeling for them. Now with Melanctha\r\nHerbert everything seemed different. Jefferson was not sure that he\r\nknew here just what he wanted. He was not sure he knew just what\r\nit was that Melanctha wanted. He knew if it was only play, with\r\nMelanctha, that he did not want to do it. But he remembered always\r\nhow she had told him he never knew how to feel things very deeply.\r\nHe remembered how she told him he was afraid to let himself ever know\r\nreal feeling, and then too, most of all to him, she had told him\r\nhe was not very understanding. That always troubled Jefferson very\r\nkeenly, he wanted very badly to be really understanding. If Jefferson\r\nonly knew better just what Melanctha meant by what she said. Jefferson\r\nalways had thought he knew something about women. Now he found that\r\nreally he knew nothing. He did not know the least bit about Melanctha.\r\nHe did not know what it was right that he should do about it. He\r\nwondered if it was just a little play that they were doing. If it was\r\na play he did not want to go on playing, but if it was really that he\r\nwas not very understanding, and that with Melanctha Herbert he could\r\nlearn to really understand, then he was very certain he did not want\r\nto be a coward. It was very hard for him to know what he wanted. He\r\nthought and thought, and always he did not seem to know any better\r\nwhat he wanted. At last he gave up this thinking. He felt sure it was\r\nonly play with Melanctha. "No, I certainly won\'t go on fooling with\r\nher any more this way," he said at last out loud to himself, when he\r\nwas through with this thinking. "I certainly will stop fooling, and\r\nbegin to go on with my thinking about my work and what\'s the matter\r\nwith people like \'Mis\' Herbert," and Jefferson took out his book\r\nfrom his pocket, and drew near to the lamp, and began with some hard\r\nscientific reading.\r\n\r\nJefferson sat there for about an hour reading, and he had really\r\nforgotten all about his trouble with Melanctha\'s meaning. Then \'Mis\'\r\nHerbert had some trouble with her breathing. She woke up and was\r\ngasping. Dr. Campbell went to her and gave her something that would\r\nhelp her. Melanctha came out from the other room and did things as he\r\ntold her. They together made \'Mis\' Herbert more comfortable and easy,\r\nand soon she was again in her deep sleep.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell went back to the steps where he had been sitting.\r\nMelanctha came and stood a little while beside him, and then she sat\r\ndown and watched him reading. By and by they began with their talking.\r\nJeff Campbell began to feel that perhaps it was all different. Perhaps\r\nit was not just play, with Melanctha. Anyway he liked it very well\r\nthat she was with him. He began to tell her about the book he was just\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was very intelligent always in her questions. Jefferson knew\r\nnow very well that she had a good mind. They were having a very good\r\ntime, talking there together. And then they began again to get quiet.\r\n\r\n"It certainly was very good in you to come back and talk to me Miss\r\nMelanctha," Jefferson said at last to her, for now he was almost\r\ncertain, it was no game she was playing. Melanctha really was a good\r\nwoman, and she had a good mind, and she had a real, strong sweetness,\r\nand she could surely really teach him. "Oh I always like to talk to\r\nyou Dr. Campbell" said Melanctha, "And then you was only just honest\r\nto me, and I always like it when a man is really honest to me." Then\r\nthey were again very silent, sitting there together, with the lamp\r\nbetween them, that was always smoking. Melanctha began to lean a\r\nlittle more toward Dr. Campbell, where he was sitting, and then\r\nshe took his hand between her two and pressed it hard, but she said\r\nnothing to him. She let it go then and leaned a little nearer to him.\r\nJefferson moved a little but did not do anything in answer. At last,\r\n"Well," said Melanctha sharply to him. "I was just thinking" began Dr.\r\nCampbell slowly, "I was just wondering," he was beginning to get ready\r\nto go on with his talking. "Don\'t you ever stop with your thinking\r\nlong enough ever to have any feeling Jeff Campbell," said Melanctha a\r\nlittle sadly. "I don\'t know," said Jeff Campbell slowly, "I don\'t know\r\nMiss Melanctha much about that. No, I don\'t stop thinking much Miss\r\nMelanctha and if I can\'t ever feel without stopping thinking, I\r\ncertainly am very much afraid Miss Melanctha that I never will do\r\nmuch with that kind of feeling. Sure you ain\'t worried Miss Melanctha,\r\nabout my really not feeling very much all the time. I certainly do\r\nthink I feel some, Miss Melanctha, even though I always do it without\r\never knowing how to stop with my thinking." "I am certainly afraid I\r\ndon\'t think much of your kind of feeling Dr. Campbell." "Why I think\r\nyou certainly are wrong Miss Melanctha I certainly do think I feel as\r\nmuch for you Miss Melanctha, as you ever feel about me, sure I do. I\r\ndon\'t think you know me right when you talk like that to me. Tell\r\nme just straight out how much do you care about me, Miss Melanctha."\r\n"Care about you Jeff Campbell," said Melanctha slowly. "I certainly do\r\ncare for you Jeff Campbell less than you are always thinking and much\r\nmore than you are ever knowing."\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell paused on this, and he was silent with the power of\r\nMelanctha\'s meaning. They sat there together very silent, a long time.\r\n"Well Jeff Campbell," said Melanctha. "Oh," said Dr. Campbell and he\r\nmoved himself a little, and then they were very silent a long time.\r\n"Haven\'t you got nothing to say to me Jeff Campbell?" said Melanctha.\r\n"Why yes, what was it we were just saying about to one another. You\r\nsee Miss Melanctha I am a very quiet, slow minded kind of fellow, and\r\nI am never sure I know just exactly what you mean by all that you are\r\nalways saying to me. But I do like you very much Miss Melanctha and I\r\nam very sure you got very good things in you all the time. You sure\r\ndo believe what I am saying to you Miss Melanctha." "Yes I believe it\r\nwhen you say it to me, Jeff Campbell," said Melanctha, and then she\r\nwas silent and there was much sadness in it. "I guess I go in and\r\nlie down again Dr. Campbell," said Melanctha. "Don\'t go leave me Miss\r\nMelanctha," said Jeff Campbell quickly. "Why not, what you want of me\r\nJeff Campbell?" said Melanctha. "Why," said Jeff Campbell slowly, "I\r\njust want to go on talking with you. I certainly do like talking about\r\nall kinds of things with you. You certainly know that all right, Miss\r\nMelanctha." "I guess I go lie down again and leave you here with your\r\nthinking," said Melanctha gently. "I certainly am very tired to night\r\nDr. Campbell. Good night I hope you rest well Dr. Campbell." Melanctha\r\nstooped over him, where he was sitting, to say this good night, and\r\nthen, very quick and sudden, she kissed him and then, very quick\r\nagain, she went away and left him.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell sat there very quiet, with only a little thinking and\r\nsometimes a beginning feeling, and he was alone until it began to be\r\nmorning, and then he went, and Melanctha helped him, and he made \'Mis\'\r\nHerbert more easy in her dying. \'Mis\' Herbert lingered on till about\r\nten o\'clock the next morning, and then slowly and without much\r\npain she died away. Jeff Campbell staid till the last moment, with\r\nMelanctha, to make her mother\'s dying easy for her. When it was over\r\nhe sent in the colored woman from next door to help Melanctha fix\r\nthings, and then he went away to take care of his other patients. He\r\ncame back very soon to Melanctha. He helped her to have a funeral for\r\nher mother. Melanctha then went to live with the good natured woman,\r\nwho had been her neighbor. Melanctha still saw Jeff Campbell very\r\noften. Things began to be very strong between them.\r\n\r\nMelanctha now never wandered, unless she was with Jeff Campbell.\r\nSometimes she and he wandered a good deal together. Jeff Campbell\r\nhad not got over his way of talking to her all the time about all the\r\nthings he was always thinking. Melanctha never talked much, now, when\r\nthey were together. Sometimes Jeff Campbell teased her about her\r\nnot talking to him. "I certainly did think Melanctha you was a great\r\ntalker from the way Jane Harden and everybody said things to me, and\r\nfrom the way I heard you talk so much when I first met you. Tell me\r\ntrue Melanctha, why don\'t you talk more now to me, perhaps it is\r\nI talk so much I don\'t give you any chance to say things to me, or\r\nperhaps it is you hear me talk so much you don\'t think so much now of\r\na whole lot of talking. Tell me honest Melanctha, why don\'t you talk\r\nmore to me." "You know very well Jeff Campbell," said Melanctha "You\r\ncertainly do know very well Jeff, you don\'t think really much, of my\r\ntalking. You think a whole lot more about everything than I do Jeff,\r\nand you don\'t care much what I got to say about it. You know that\'s\r\ntrue what I am saying Jeff, if you want to be real honest, the way you\r\nalways are when I like you so much." Jeff laughed and looked fondly\r\nat her. "I don\'t say ever I know, you ain\'t right, when you say things\r\nlike that to me, Melanctha. You see you always like to be talking just\r\nwhat you think everybody wants to be hearing from you, and when you\r\nare like that, Melanctha, honest, I certainly don\'t care very much to\r\nhear you, but sometimes you say something that is what you are really\r\nthinking, and then I like a whole lot to hear you talking." Melanctha\r\nsmiled, with her strong sweetness, on him, and she felt her power\r\nvery deeply. "I certainly never do talk very much when I like anybody\r\nreally, Jeff. You see, Jeff, it ain\'t much use to talk about what a\r\nwoman is really feeling in her. You see all that, Jeff, better, by and\r\nby, when you get to really feeling. You won\'t be so ready then always\r\nwith your talking. You see, Jeff, if it don\'t come true what I am\r\nsaying." "I don\'t ever say you ain\'t always right, Melanctha," said\r\nJeff Campbell. "Perhaps what I call my thinking ain\'t really so very\r\nunderstanding. I don\'t say, no never now any more, you ain\'t right,\r\nMelanctha, when you really say things to me. Perhaps I see it all to\r\nbe very different when I come to really see what you mean by what you\r\nare always saying to me." "You is very sweet and good to me always,\r\nJeff Campbell," said Melanctha. "\'Deed I certainly am not good to\r\nyou, Melanctha. Don\'t I bother you all the time with my talking, but\r\nI really do like you a whole lot, Melanctha." "And I like you, Jeff\r\nCampbell, and you certainly are mother, and father, and brother, and\r\nsister, and child and everything, always to me. I can\'t say much about\r\nhow good you been to me, Jeff Campbell, I never knew any man who was\r\ngood and didn\'t do things ugly, before I met you to take care of me,\r\nJeff Campbell. Good-by, Jeff, come see me to-morrow, when you get\r\nthrough with your working." "Sure Melanctha, you know that already,"\r\nsaid Jeff Campbell, and then he went away and left her.\r\n\r\nThese months had been an uncertain time for Jeff Campbell. He never\r\nknew how much he really knew about Melanctha. He saw her now for long\r\ntimes and very often. He was beginning always more and more to like\r\nher. But he did not seem to himself to know very much about her. He\r\nwas beginning to feel he could almost trust the goodness in her. But\r\nthen, always, really, he was not very sure about her. Melanctha always\r\nhad ways that made him feel uncertain with her, and yet he was so\r\nnear, in his feeling for her. He now never thought about all this in\r\nreal words any more. He was always letting it fight itself out in\r\nhim. He was now never taking any part in this fighting that was always\r\ngoing on inside him.\r\n\r\nJeff always loved now to be with Melanctha and yet he always hated to\r\ngo to her. Somehow he was always afraid when he was to go to her,\r\nand yet he had made himself very certain that here he would not be a\r\ncoward. He never felt any of this being afraid, when he was with her.\r\nThen they always were very true, and near to one another. But always\r\nwhen he was going to her, Jeff would like anything that could happen\r\nthat would keep him a little longer from her.\r\n\r\nIt was a very uncertain time, all these months, for Jeff Campbell. He\r\ndid not know very well what it was that he really wanted. He was very\r\ncertain that he did not know very well what it was that Melanctha\r\nwanted. Jeff Campbell had always all his life loved to be with people,\r\nand he had loved all his life always to be thinking, but he was still\r\nonly a great boy, was Jeff Campbell, and he had never before had any\r\nof this funny kind of feeling. Now, this evening, when he was free\r\nto go and see Melanctha, he talked to anybody he could find who would\r\ndetain him, and so it was very late when at last he came to the house\r\nwhere Melanctha was waiting to receive him.\r\n\r\nJeff came in to where Melanctha was waiting for him, and he took off\r\nhis hat and heavy coat, and then drew up a chair and sat down by the\r\nfire. It was very cold that night, and Jeff sat there, and rubbed\r\nhis hands and tried to warm them. He had only said "How do you do" to\r\nMelanctha, he had not yet begun to talk to her. Melanctha sat there,\r\nby the fire, very quiet. The heat gave a pretty pink glow to her pale\r\nyellow and attractive face. Melanctha sat in a low chair, her hands,\r\nwith their long, fluttering fingers, always ready to show her strong\r\nfeeling, were lying quiet in her lap. Melanctha was very tired with\r\nher waiting for Jeff Campbell. She sat there very quiet and just\r\nwatching. Jeff was a robust, dark, healthy, cheery negro. His hands\r\nwere firm and kindly and unimpassioned. He touched women always with\r\nhis big hands, like a brother. He always had a warm broad glow, like\r\nsouthern sunshine. He never had anything mysterious in him. He\r\nwas open, he was pleasant, he was cheery, and always he wanted,\r\nas Melanctha once had wanted, always now he too wanted really to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nJeff sat there this evening in his chair and was silent a long time,\r\nwarming himself with the pleasant fire. He did not look at Melanctha\r\nwho was watching. He sat there and just looked into the fire. At first\r\nhis dark, open face was smiling, and he was rubbing the back of his\r\nblack-brown hand over his mouth to help him in his smiling. Then he\r\nwas thinking, and he frowned and rubbed his head hard, to help him in\r\nhis thinking. Then he smiled again, but now his smiling was not very\r\npleasant. His smile was now wavering on the edge of scorning. His\r\nsmile changed more and more, and then he had a look as if he were\r\ndeeply down, all disgusted. Now his face was darker, and he was bitter\r\nin his smiling, and he began, without looking from the fire, to talk\r\nto Melanctha, who was now very tense with her watching.\r\n\r\n"Melanctha Herbert", began Jeff Campbell, "I certainly after all this\r\ntime I know you, I certainly do know little, real about you. You see,\r\nMelanctha, it\'s like this way with me"; Jeff was frowning, with his\r\nthinking and looking very hard into the fire, "You see it\'s just this\r\nway, with me now, Melanctha. Sometimes you seem like one kind of a\r\ngirl to me, and sometimes you are like a girl that is all different\r\nto me, and the two kinds of girls is certainly very different to each\r\nother, and I can\'t see any way they seem to have much to do, to be\r\ntogether in you. They certainly don\'t seem to be made much like as if\r\nthey could have anything really to do with each other. Sometimes you\r\nare a girl to me I certainly never would be trusting, and you got a\r\nlaugh then so hard, it just rattles, and you got ways so bad, I can\'t\r\nbelieve you mean them hardly, and yet all that I just been saying is\r\ncertainly you one way I often see you, and it\'s what your mother and\r\nJane Harden always found you, and it\'s what makes me hate so, to come\r\nnear you. And then certainly sometimes, Melanctha, you certainly is\r\nall a different creature, and sometimes then there comes out in you\r\nwhat is certainly a thing, like a real beauty. I certainly, Melanctha,\r\nnever can tell just how it is that it comes so lovely. Seems to me\r\nwhen it comes it\'s got a real sweetness, that is more wonderful than a\r\npure flower, and a gentleness, that is more tender than the sunshine,\r\nand a kindness, that makes one feel like summer, and then a way\r\nto know, that makes everything all over, and all that, and it does\r\ncertainly seem to be real for the little while it\'s lasting, for the\r\nlittle while that I can surely see it, and it gives me to feel like I\r\ncertainly had got real religion. And then when I got rich with such\r\na feeling, comes all that other girl, and then that seems more likely\r\nthat that is really you what\'s honest, and then I certainly do get\r\nawful afraid to come to you, and I certainly never do feel I could be\r\nvery trusting with you. And then I certainly don\'t know anything at\r\nall about you, and I certainly don\'t know which is a real Melanctha\r\nHerbert, and I certainly don\'t feel no longer, I ever want to talk to\r\nyou. Tell me honest, Melanctha, which is the way that is you really,\r\nwhen you are alone, and real, and all honest. Tell me, Melanctha, for\r\nI certainly do want to know it."\r\n\r\nMelanctha did not make him any answer, and Jeff, without looking\r\nat her, after a little while, went on with his talking. "And then,\r\nMelanctha, sometimes you certainly do seem sort of cruel, and not to\r\ncare about people being hurt or in trouble, something so hard about\r\nyou it makes me sometimes real nervous, sometimes somehow like\r\nyou always, like your being, with \'Mis\' Herbert. You sure did do\r\neverything that any woman could, Melanctha, I certainly never did see\r\nanybody do things any better, and yet, I don\'t know how to say just\r\nwhat I mean, Melanctha, but there was something awful hard about your\r\nfeeling, so different from the way I\'m always used to see good people\r\nfeeling, and so it was the way Jane Harden and \'Mis\' Herbert talked\r\nwhen they felt strong to talk about you, and yet, Melanctha, somehow\r\nI feel so really near to you, and you certainly have got an awful\r\nwonderful, strong kind of sweetness. I certainly would like to know\r\nfor sure, Melanctha, whether I got really anything to be afraid for. I\r\ncertainly did think once, Melanctha, I knew something about all kinds\r\nof women. I certainly know now really, how I don\'t know anything sure\r\nat all about you, Melanctha, though I been with you so long, and so\r\nmany times for whole hours with you, and I like so awful much to\r\nbe with you, and I can always say anything I am thinking to you. I\r\ncertainly do awful wish, Melanctha, I really was more understanding. I\r\ncertainly do that same, Melanctha."\r\n\r\nJeff stopped now and looked harder than before into the fire. His face\r\nchanged from his thinking back into that look that was so like as if\r\nhe was all through and through him, disgusted with what he had been\r\nthinking. He sat there a long time, very quiet, and then slowly,\r\nsomehow, it came strongly to him that Melanctha Herbert, there\r\nbeside him, was trembling and feeling it all to be very bitter. "Why,\r\nMelanctha," cried Jeff Campbell, and he got up and put his arm around\r\nher like a brother. "I stood it just so long as I could bear it,\r\nJeff," sobbed Melanctha, and then she gave herself away, to her\r\nmisery, "I was awful ready, Jeff, to let you say anything you liked\r\nthat gave you any pleasure. You could say all about me what you\r\nwanted, Jeff, and I would try to stand it, so as you would be sure to\r\nbe liking it, Jeff, but you was too cruel to me. When you do that kind\r\nof seeing how much you can make a woman suffer, you ought to give her\r\na little rest, once sometimes, Jeff. They can\'t any of us stand it so\r\nfor always, Jeff. I certainly did stand it just as long as I could,\r\nso you would like it, but I,--oh Jeff, you went on too long to-night\r\nJeff. I couldn\'t stand it not a minute longer the way you was doing\r\nof it, Jeff. When you want to be seeing how the way a woman is really\r\nmade of, Jeff, you shouldn\'t never be so cruel, never to be thinking\r\nhow much she can stand, the strong way you always do it, Jeff." "Why,\r\nMelanctha," cried Jeff Campbell, in his horror, and then he was very\r\ntender to her, and like a good, strong, gentle brother in his soothing\r\nof her, "Why Melanctha dear, I certainly don\'t now see what it is you\r\nmean by what you was just saying to me. Why Melanctha, you poor little\r\ngirl, you certainly never did believe I ever knew I was giving you\r\nreal suffering. Why, Melanctha, how could you ever like me if you\r\nthought I ever could be so like a red Indian?" "I didn\'t just know,\r\nJeff," and Melanctha nestled to him, "I certainly never did know just\r\nwhat it was you wanted to be doing with me, but I certainly wanted\r\nyou should do anything you liked, you wanted, to make me more\r\nunderstanding for you. I tried awful hard to stand it, Jeff, so as you\r\ncould do anything you wanted with me." "Good Lord and Jesus Christ,\r\nMelanctha!" cried Jeff Campbell. "I certainly never can know anything\r\nabout you real, Melanctha, you poor little girl," and Jeff drew her\r\ncloser to him, "But I certainly do admire and trust you a whole lot\r\nnow, Melanctha. I certainly do, for I certainly never did think I was\r\nhurting you at all, Melanctha, by the things I always been saying to\r\nyou. Melanctha, you poor little, sweet, trembling baby now, be good,\r\nMelanctha. I certainly can\'t ever tell you how awful sorry I am to\r\nhurt you so, Melanctha. I do anything I can to show you how I\r\nnever did mean to hurt you, Melanctha." "I know, I know," murmured\r\nMelanctha, clinging to him. "I know you are a good man, Jeff. I always\r\nknow that, no matter how much you can hurt me." "I sure don\'t see how\r\nyou can think so, Melanctha, if you certainly did think I was trying\r\nso hard just to hurt you." "Hush, you are only a great big boy, Jeff\r\nCampbell, and you don\'t know nothing yet about real hurting," said\r\nMelanctha, smiling up through her crying, at him. "You see, Jeff,\r\nI never knew anybody I could know real well and yet keep on always\r\nrespecting, till I came to know you real well, Jeff." "I sure don\'t\r\nunderstand that very well, Melanctha. I ain\'t a bit better than just\r\nlots of others of the colored people. You certainly have been unlucky\r\nwith the kind you met before me, that\'s all, Melanctha. I certainly\r\nain\'t very good, Melanctha." "Hush, Jeff, you don\'t know nothing\r\nat all about what you are," said Melanctha. "Perhaps you are right,\r\nMelanctha. I don\'t say ever any more, you ain\'t right, when you say\r\nthings to me, Melanctha," and Jefferson sighed, and then he smiled,\r\nand then they were quiet a long time together, and then after some\r\nmore kindness, it was late, and then Jeff left her.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell, all these months, had never told his good mother\r\nanything about Melanctha Herbert. Somehow he always kept his seeing\r\nher so much now, to himself. Melanctha too had never had any of her\r\nother friends meet him. They always acted together, these two, as if\r\ntheir being so much together was a secret, but really there was no\r\none who would have made it any harder for them. Jeff Campbell did not\r\nreally know how it had happened that they were so secret. He did not\r\nknow if it was what Melanctha wanted. Jeff had never spoken to her\r\nat all about it. It just seemed as if it were well understood between\r\nthem that nobody should know that they were so much together. It\r\nwas as if it were agreed between them, that they should be alone by\r\nthemselves always, and so they would work out together what they meant\r\nby what they were always saying to each other.\r\n\r\nJefferson often spoke to Melanctha about his good mother. He never\r\nsaid anything about whether Melanctha would want to meet her.\r\nJefferson never quite understood why all this had happened so, in\r\nsecret. He never really knew what it was that Melanctha really wanted.\r\nIn all these ways he just, by his nature, did, what he sort of felt\r\nMelanctha wanted. And so they continued to be alone and much together,\r\nand now it had come to be the spring time, and now they had all\r\nout-doors to wander.\r\n\r\nThey had many days now when they were very happy. Jeff every day found\r\nthat he really liked Melanctha better. Now surely he was beginning to\r\nhave real, deep feeling in him. And still he loved to talk himself out\r\nto Melanctha, and he loved to tell her how good it all was to him, and\r\nhow he always loved to be with her, and to tell her always all about\r\nit. One day, now Jeff arranged, that Sunday they would go out and have\r\na happy, long day in the bright fields, and they would be all day just\r\nalone together. The day before, Jeff was called in to see Jane Harden.\r\n\r\nJane Harden was very sick almost all day and Jeff Campbell did\r\neverything he could to make her better. After a while Jane became more\r\neasy and then she began to talk to Jeff about Melanctha. Jane did not\r\nknow how much Jeff was now seeing of Melanctha. Jane these days never\r\nsaw Melanctha. Jane began to talk of the time when she first knew\r\nMelanctha. Jane began to tell how in these days Melanctha had very\r\nlittle understanding. She was young then and she had a good mind. Jane\r\nHarden never would say Melanctha never had a good mind, but in those\r\ndays Melanctha certainly had not been very understanding. Jane began\r\nto explain to Jeff Campbell how in every way, she Jane, had taught\r\nMelanctha. Jane then began to explain how eager Melanctha always had\r\nbeen for all that kind of learning. Jane Harden began to tell how they\r\nhad wandered. Jane began to tell how Melanctha once had loved her,\r\nJane Harden. Jane began to tell Jeff of all the bad ways Melanctha had\r\nused with her. Jane began to tell all she knew of the way Melanctha\r\nhad gone on, after she had left her. Jane began to tell all about the\r\ndifferent men, white ones and blacks, Melanctha never was particular\r\nabout things like that, Jane Harden said in passing, not that\r\nMelanctha was a bad one, and she had a good mind, Jane Harden never\r\nwould say that she hadn\'t, but Melanctha always liked to use all the\r\nunderstanding ways that Jane had taught her, and so she wanted to know\r\neverything, always, that they knew how to teach her.\r\n\r\nJane was beginning to make Jeff Campbell see much clearer. Jane Harden\r\ndid not know what it was that she was really doing with all this\r\ntalking. Jane did not know what Jeff was feeling. Jane was always\r\nhonest when she was talking, and now it just happened she had started\r\ntalking about her old times with Melanctha Herbert. Jeff understood\r\nvery well that it was all true what Jane was saying. Jeff Campbell was\r\nbeginning now to see very clearly. He was beginning to feel very sick\r\ninside him. He knew now many things Melanctha had not yet taught\r\nhim. He felt very sick and his heart was very heavy, and Melanctha\r\ncertainly did seem very ugly to him. Jeff was at last beginning to\r\nknow what it was to have deep feeling. He took care a little longer of\r\nJane Harden, and then he went to his other patients, and then he went\r\nhome to his room, and he sat down and at last he had stopped thinking.\r\nHe was very sick and his heart was very heavy in him. He was very\r\ntired and all the world was very dreary to him, and he knew very well\r\nnow at last, he was really feeling. He knew it now from the way it\r\nhurt him. He knew very well that now at last he was beginning to\r\nreally have understanding. The next day he had arranged to spend, long\r\nand happy, all alone in the spring fields with Melanctha, wandering.\r\nHe wrote her a note and said he could not go, he had a sick patient\r\nand would have to stay home with him. For three days after, he made no\r\nsign to Melanctha. He was very sick all these days, and his heart\r\nwas very heavy in him, and he knew very well that now at last he had\r\nlearned what it was to have deep feeling.\r\n\r\nAt last one day he got a letter from Melanctha. "I certainly don\'t\r\nrightly understand what you are doing now to me Jeff Campbell," wrote\r\nMelanctha Herbert. "I certainly don\'t rightly understand Jeff Campbell\r\nwhy you ain\'t all these days been near me, but I certainly do suppose\r\nit\'s just another one of the queer kind of ways you have to be good,\r\nand repenting of yourself all of a sudden. I certainly don\'t say to\r\nyou Jeff Campbell I admire very much the way you take to be good Jeff\r\nCampbell. I am sorry Dr. Campbell, but I certainly am afraid I\r\ncan\'t stand it no more from you the way you have been just acting. I\r\ncertainly can\'t stand it any more the way you act when you have been\r\nas if you thought I was always good enough for anybody to have with\r\nthem, and then you act as if I was a bad one and you always just\r\ndespise me. I certainly am afraid Dr. Campbell I can\'t stand it any\r\nmore like that. I certainly can\'t stand it any more the way you are\r\nalways changing. I certainly am afraid Dr. Campbell you ain\'t man\r\nenough to deserve to have anybody care so much to be always with you.\r\nI certainly am awful afraid Dr. Campbell I don\'t ever any more want\r\nto really see you. Good-by Dr. Campbell I wish you always to be real\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell sat in his room, very quiet, a long time, after he got\r\nthrough reading this letter. He sat very still and first he was very\r\nangry. As if he, too, did not know very badly what it was to suffer\r\nkeenly. As if he had not been very strong to stay with Melanctha when\r\nhe never knew what it was that she really wanted. He knew he was very\r\nright to be angry, he knew he really had not been a coward. He knew\r\nMelanctha had done many things it was very hard for him to forgive\r\nher. He knew very well he had done his best to be kind, and to\r\ntrust her, and to be loyal to her, and now;--and then Jeff suddenly\r\nremembered how one night Melanctha had been so strong to suffer, and\r\nhe felt come back to him the sweetness in her, and then Jeff knew that\r\nreally, he always forgave her, and that really, it all was that he was\r\nso sorry he had hurt her, and he wanted to go straight away and be a\r\ncomfort to her. Jeff knew very well, that what Jane Harden had told\r\nhim about Melanctha and her bad ways, had been a true story, and yet\r\nhe wanted very badly to be with Melanctha. Perhaps she could teach\r\nhim to really understand it better. Perhaps she could teach him how it\r\ncould be all true, and yet how he could be right to believe in her and\r\nto trust her.\r\n\r\nJeff sat down and began his answer to her. "Dear Melanctha," Jeff\r\nwrote to her. "I certainly don\'t think you got it all just right in\r\nthe letter, I just been reading, that you just wrote me. I certainly\r\ndon\'t think you are just fair or very understanding to all I have\r\nto suffer to keep straight on to really always to believe in you and\r\ntrust you. I certainly don\'t think you always are fair to remember\r\nright how hard it is for a man, who thinks like I was always thinking,\r\nnot to think you do things very bad very often. I certainly don\'t\r\nthink, Melanctha, I ain\'t right when I was so angry when I got your\r\nletter to me. I know very well, Melanctha, that with you, I never have\r\nbeen a coward. I find it very hard, and I never said it any different,\r\nit is hard to me to be understanding, and to know really what it is\r\nyou wanted, and what it is you are meaning by what you are always\r\nsaying to me. I don\'t say ever, it ain\'t very hard for you to be\r\nstanding that I ain\'t very quick to be following whichever way that\r\nyou are always leading. You know very well, Melanctha, it hurts me\r\nvery bad and way inside me when I have to hurt you, but I always got\r\nto be real honest with you. There ain\'t no other way for me to be,\r\nwith you, and I know very well it hurts me too, a whole lot, when\r\nI can\'t follow so quick as you would have me. I don\'t like to be a\r\ncoward to you, Melanctha, and I don\'t like to say what I ain\'t meaning\r\nto you. And if you don\'t want me to do things honest, Melanctha, why\r\nI can\'t ever talk to you, and you are right when you say, you never\r\nagain want to see me, but if you got any real sense of what I always\r\nbeen feeling with you, and if you got any right sense, Melanctha, of\r\nhow hard I been trying to think and to feel right for you, I will be\r\nvery glad to come and see you, and to begin again with you. I don\'t\r\nsay anything now, Melanctha, about how bad I been this week, since\r\nI saw you, Melanctha. It don\'t ever do any good to talk such things\r\nover. All I know is I do my best, Melanctha, to you, and I don\'t say,\r\nno, never, I can do any different than just to be honest and come as\r\nfast as I think it\'s right for me to be going in the ways you teach\r\nme to be really understanding. So don\'t talk any more foolishness,\r\nMelanctha, about my always changing. I don\'t change, never, and I got\r\nto do what I think is right and honest to me, and I never told you\r\nany different, and you always knew it very well that I always would do\r\njust so. If you like me to come and see you to-morrow, and go out with\r\nyou, I will be very glad to, Melanctha. Let me know right away, what\r\nit is you want me to be doing for you, Melanctha.\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n  Jefferson Campbell\r\n\r\n"Please come to me, Jeff." Melanctha wrote back for her answer. Jeff\r\nwent very slowly to Melanctha, glad as he was, still to be going to\r\nher. Melanctha came, very quick, to meet him, when she saw him\r\nfrom where she had been watching for him. They went into the house\r\ntogether. They were very glad to be together. They were very good to\r\none another.\r\n\r\n"I certainly did think, Melanctha, this time almost really, you never\r\ndid want me to come to you at all any more to see you," said Jeff\r\nCampbell to her, when they had begun again with their talking to each\r\nother. "You certainly did make me think, perhaps really this time,\r\nMelanctha, it was all over, my being with you ever, and I was very\r\nmad, and very sorry, too, Melanctha."\r\n\r\n"Well you certainly was very bad to me, Jeff Campbell," said\r\nMelanctha, fondly.\r\n\r\n"I certainly never do say any more you ain\'t always right, Melanctha,"\r\nJeff answered and he was very ready now with cheerful laughing, "I\r\ncertainly never do say that any more, Melanctha, if I know it, but\r\nstill, really, Melanctha, honest, I think perhaps I wasn\'t real bad to\r\nyou any more than you just needed from me."\r\n\r\nJeff held Melanctha in his arms and kissed her. He sighed then and was\r\nvery silent with her. "Well, Melanctha," he said at last, with some\r\nmore laughing, "well, Melanctha, any way you can\'t say ever it ain\'t,\r\nif we are ever friends good and really, you can\'t say, no, never, but\r\nthat we certainly have worked right hard to get both of us together\r\nfor it, so we shall sure deserve it then, if we can ever really get\r\nit." "We certainly have worked real hard, Jeff, I can\'t say that ain\'t\r\nall right the way you say it," said Melanctha. "I certainly never\r\ncan deny it, Jeff, when I feel so worn with all the trouble you been\r\nmaking for me, you bad boy, Jeff," and then Melanctha smiled and then\r\nshe sighed, and then she was very silent with him.\r\n\r\nAt last Jeff was to go away. They stood there on the steps for a long\r\ntime trying to say good-by to each other. At last Jeff made himself\r\nreally say it. At last he made himself, that he went down the steps\r\nand went away.\r\n\r\nOn the next Sunday they arranged, they were to have the long happy day\r\nof wandering that they had lost last time by Jane Harden\'s talking.\r\nNot that Melanctha Herbert had heard yet of Jane Harden\'s talking.\r\n\r\nJeff saw Melanctha every day now. Jeff was a little uncertain all this\r\ntime inside him, for he had never yet told to Melanctha what it was\r\nthat had so nearly made him really want to leave her. Jeff knew that\r\nfor him, it was not right he should not tell her. He knew they could\r\nonly have real peace between them when he had been honest, and had\r\nreally told her. On this long Sunday Jeff was certain that he would\r\nreally tell her.\r\n\r\nThey were very happy all that day in their wandering. They had taken\r\nthings along to eat together. They sat in the bright fields and they\r\nwere happy, they wandered in the woods and they were happy. Jeff\r\nalways loved in this way to wander. Jeff always loved to watch\r\neverything as it was growing, and he loved all the colors in the trees\r\nand on the ground, and the little, new, bright colored bugs he found\r\nin the moist ground and in the grass he loved to lie on and in which\r\nhe was always so busy searching. Jeff loved everything that moved and\r\nthat was still, and that had color, and beauty, and real being.\r\n\r\nJeff loved very much this day while they were wandering. He almost\r\nforgot that he had any trouble with him still inside him. Jeff loved\r\nto be there with Melanctha Herbert. She was always so sympathetic to\r\nhim for the way she listened to everything he found and told her, the\r\nway she felt his joy in all this being, the way she never said she\r\nwanted anything different from the way they had it. It was certainly a\r\nbusy and a happy day, this their first long day of really wandering.\r\n\r\nLater they were tired, and Melanctha sat down on the ground, and Jeff\r\nthrew himself his full length beside her. Jeff lay there, very quiet,\r\nand then he pressed her hand and kissed it and murmured to her, "You\r\ncertainly are very good to me, Melanctha." Melanctha felt it very deep\r\nand did not answer. Jeff lay there a long time, looking up above\r\nhim. He was counting all the little leaves he saw above him. He was\r\nfollowing all the little clouds with his eyes as they sailed past him.\r\nHe watched all the birds that flew high beyond him, and all the time\r\nJeff knew he must tell to Melanctha what it was he knew now, that\r\nwhich Jane Harden, just a week ago, had told him. He knew very well\r\nthat for him it was certain that he had to say it. It was hard, but\r\nfor Jeff Campbell the only way to lose it was to say it, the only way\r\nto know Melanctha really, was to tell her all the struggle he had\r\nmade to know her, to tell her so she could help him to understand his\r\ntrouble better, to help him so that never again he could have any way\r\nto doubt her.\r\n\r\nJeff lay there a long time, very quiet, always looking up above him,\r\nand yet feeling very close now to Melanctha. At last he turned a\r\nlittle toward her, took her hands closer in his to make him feel it\r\nstronger, and then very slowly, for the words came very hard for him,\r\nslowly he began his talk to her.\r\n\r\n"Melanctha," began Jeff, very slowly, "Melanctha, it ain\'t right I\r\nshouldn\'t tell you why I went away last week and almost never got the\r\nchance again to see you. Jane Harden was sick, and I went in to take\r\ncare of her. She began to tell everything she ever knew about you. She\r\ndidn\'t know how well now I know you. I didn\'t tell her not to go\r\non talking. I listened while she told me everything about you. I\r\ncertainly found it very hard with what she told me. I know she was\r\ntalking truth in everything she said about you. I knew you had been\r\nfree in your ways, Melanctha, I knew you liked to get excitement the\r\nway I always hate to see the colored people take it. I didn\'t\r\nknow, till I heard Jane Harden say it, you had done things so bad,\r\nMelanctha. When Jane Harden told me, I got very sick, Melanctha. I\r\ncouldn\'t bear hardly, to think, perhaps I was just another like them\r\nto you, Melanctha. I was wrong not to trust you perhaps, Melanctha,\r\nbut it did make things very ugly to me. I try to be honest to you,\r\nMelanctha, the way you say you really want it from me."\r\n\r\nMelanctha drew her hands from Jeff Campbell. She sat there, and there\r\nwas deep scorn in her anger.\r\n\r\n"If you wasn\'t all through just selfish and nothing else, Jeff\r\nCampbell, you would take care you wouldn\'t have to tell me things like\r\nthis, Jeff Campbell."\r\n\r\nJeff was silent a little, and he waited before he gave his answer. It\r\nwas not the power of Melanctha\'s words that held him, for, for them,\r\nhe had his answer, it was the power of the mood that filled Melanctha,\r\nand for that he had no answer. At last he broke through this awe, with\r\nhis slow fighting resolution, and he began to give his answer.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say ever, Melanctha," he began, "it wouldn\'t have been more\r\nright for me to stop Jane Harden in her talking and to come to you to\r\nhave you tell me what you were when I never knew you. I don\'t say it,\r\nno never to you, that that would not have been the right way for me\r\nto do, Melanctha. But I certainly am without any kind of doubting, I\r\ncertainly do know for sure, I had a good right to know about what you\r\nwere and your ways and your trying to use your understanding, every\r\nkind of way you could to get your learning. I certainly did have a\r\nright to know things like that about you, Melanctha. I don\'t say it\r\never, Melanctha, and I say it very often, I don\'t say ever I shouldn\'t\r\nhave stopped Jane Harden in her talking and come to you and asked you\r\nyourself to tell me all about it, but I guess I wanted to keep myself\r\nfrom how much it would hurt me more, to have you yourself say it to\r\nme. Perhaps it was I wanted to keep you from having it hurt you so\r\nmuch more, having you to have to tell it to me. I don\'t know, I don\'t\r\nsay it was to help you from being hurt most, or to help me. Perhaps I\r\nwas a coward to let Jane Harden tell me \'stead of coming straight\r\nto you, to have you tell me, but I certainly am sure, Melanctha, I\r\ncertainly had a right to know such things about you. I don\'t say it\r\never, ever, Melanctha, I hadn\'t the just right to know those things\r\nabout you." Melanctha laughed her harsh laugh. "You needn\'t have been\r\nunder no kind of worry, Jeff Campbell, about whether you should have\r\nasked me. You could have asked, it wouldn\'t have hurt nothing. I\r\ncertainly never would have told you nothing." "I am not so sure of\r\nthat, Melanctha," said Jeff Campbell. "I certainly do think you would\r\nhave told me. I certainly do think I could make you feel it right to\r\ntell me. I certainly do think all I did wrong was to let Jane Harden\r\ntell me. I certainly do know I never did wrong, to learn what she told\r\nme. I certainly know very well, Melanctha, if I had come here to you,\r\nyou would have told it all to me, Melanctha."\r\n\r\nHe was silent, and this struggle lay there, strong, between them.\r\nIt was a struggle, sure to be going on always between them. It was a\r\nstruggle that was as sure always to be going on between them, as their\r\nminds and hearts always were to have different ways of working.\r\n\r\nAt last Melanctha took his hand, leaned over him and kissed him. "I\r\nsure am very fond of you, Jeff Campbell," Melanctha whispered to him.\r\n\r\nNow for a little time there was not any kind of trouble between Jeff\r\nCampbell and Melanctha Herbert. They were always together now for long\r\ntimes, and very often. They got much joy now, both of them, from being\r\nall the time together.\r\n\r\nIt was summer now, and they had warm sunshine to wander. It was summer\r\nnow, and Jeff Campbell had more time to wander, for colored people\r\nnever get sick so much in the summer. It was summer now, and there was\r\na lovely silence everywhere, and all the noises, too, that they heard\r\naround them were lovely ones, and added to the joy, in these warm\r\ndays, they loved so much to be together.\r\n\r\nThey talked some to each other in these days, did Jeff Campbell and\r\nMelanctha Herbert, but always in these days their talking more and\r\nmore was like it always is with real lovers. Jeff did not talk so\r\nmuch now about what he before always had been thinking. Sometimes Jeff\r\nwould be, as if he was just waking from himself to be with Melanctha,\r\nand then he would find he had been really all the long time with her,\r\nand he had really never needed to be doing any thinking.\r\n\r\nIt was sometimes pure joy Jeff would be talking to Melanctha, in these\r\nwarm days he loved so much to wander with her. Sometimes Jeff would\r\nlose all himself in a strong feeling. Very often now, and always with\r\nmore joy in his feeling, he would find himself, he did not know how or\r\nwhat it was he had been thinking. And Melanctha always loved very well\r\nto make him feel it. She always now laughed a little at him, and went\r\nback a little in him to his before, always thinking, and she teased\r\nhim with his always now being so good with her in his feeling, and\r\nthen she would so well and freely, and with her pure, strong ways of\r\nreaching, she would give him all the love she knew now very well, how\r\nmuch he always wanted to be sure he really had it.\r\n\r\nAnd Jeff took it straight now, and he loved it, and he felt, strong,\r\nthe joy of all this being, and it swelled out full inside him, and he\r\npoured it all out back to her in freedom, in tender kindness, and in\r\njoy, and in gentle brother fondling. And Melanctha loved him for it\r\nalways, her Jeff Campbell now, who never did things ugly, for her,\r\nlike all the men she always knew before always had been doing to\r\nher. And they loved it always, more and more, together, with this new\r\nfeeling they had now, in these long summer days so warm; they, always\r\ntogether now, just these two so dear, more and more to each other\r\nalways, and the summer evenings when they wandered, and the noises in\r\nthe full streets, and the music of the organs, and the dancing, and\r\nthe warm smell of the people, and of dogs and of the horses, and\r\nall the joy of the strong, sweet pungent, dirty, moist, warm negro\r\nsouthern summer.\r\n\r\nEvery day now, Jeff seemed to be coming nearer, to be really loving.\r\nEvery day now, Melanctha poured it all out to him, with more freedom.\r\nEvery day now, they seemed to be having more and more, both together,\r\nof this strong, right feeling. More and more every day now they seemed\r\nto know more really, what it was each other one was always feeling.\r\nMore and more now every day Jeff found in himself, he felt more\r\ntrusting. More and more every day now, he did not think anything in\r\nwords about what he was always doing. Every day now more and more\r\nMelanctha would let out to Jeff her real, strong feeling.\r\n\r\nOne day there had been much joy between them, more than they ever yet\r\nhad had with their new feeling. All the day they had lost themselves\r\nin warm wandering. Now they were lying there and resting, with a\r\ngreen, bright, light-flecked world around them.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that now really happened to them? What was it that\r\nMelanctha did, that made everything get all ugly for them? What was it\r\nthat Melanctha felt then, that made Jeff remember all the feeling he\r\nhad had in him when Jane Harden told him how Melanctha had learned\r\nto be so very understanding? Jeff did not know how it was that it had\r\nhappened to him. It was all green, and warm, and very lovely to him,\r\nand now Melanctha somehow had made it all so ugly for him. What was it\r\nMelanctha was now doing with him? What was it he used to be thinking\r\nwas the right way for him and all the colored people to be always\r\ntrying to make it right, the way they should be always living? Why was\r\nMelanctha Herbert now all so ugly for him?\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert somehow had made him feel deeply just then, what\r\nvery more it was that she wanted from him. Jeff Campbell now felt\r\nin him what everybody always had needed to make them really\r\nunderstanding, to him. Jeff felt a strong disgust inside him; not for\r\nMelanctha herself, to him, not for himself really, in him, not for\r\nwhat it was that everybody wanted, in them; he only had disgust\r\nbecause he never could know really in him, what it was he wanted, to\r\nbe really right in understanding, for him, he only had disgust because\r\nhe never could know really what it was really right to him to be\r\nalways doing, in the things he had before believed in, the things he\r\nbefore had believed in for himself and for all the colored people, the\r\nliving regular, and the never wanting to be always having new things,\r\njust to keep on, always being in excitements. All the old thinking now\r\ncame up very strong inside him. He sort of turned away then, and threw\r\nMelanctha from him.\r\n\r\nJeff never, even now, knew what it was that moved him. He never, even\r\nnow, was ever sure, he really knew what Melanctha was, when she was\r\nreal herself, and honest. He thought he knew, and then there came to\r\nhim some moment, just like this one, when she really woke him up to\r\nbe strong in him. Then he really knew he could know nothing. He knew\r\nthen, he never could know what it was she really wanted with him. He\r\nknew then he never could know really what it was he felt inside him.\r\nIt was all so mixed up inside him. All he knew was he wanted very\r\nbadly Melanctha should be there beside him, and he wanted very badly,\r\ntoo, always to throw her from him. What was it really that Melanctha\r\nwanted with him? What was it really, he, Jeff Campbell, wanted she\r\nshould give him? "I certainly did think now," Jeff Campbell groaned\r\ninside him, "I certainly did think now I really was knowing all right,\r\nwhat I wanted. I certainly did really think now I was knowing how to\r\nbe trusting with Melanctha. I certainly did think it was like that now\r\nwith me sure, after all I\'ve been through all this time with her. And\r\nnow I certainly do know I don\'t know anything that\'s very real about\r\nher. Oh the good Lord help and keep me!" and Jeff groaned hard inside\r\nhim, and he buried his face deep in the green grass underneath him,\r\nand Melanctha Herbert was very silent there beside him.\r\n\r\nThen Jeff turned to look and see her. She was lying very still there\r\nby him, and the bitter water on her face was biting. Jeff was so\r\nvery sorry then, all over and inside him, the way he always was when\r\nMelanctha had been deep hurt by him. "I didn\'t mean to be so bad\r\nagain to you, Melanctha, dear one," and he was very tender to her.\r\n"I certainly didn\'t never mean to go to be so bad to you, Melanctha,\r\ndarling. I certainly don\'t know, Melanctha, darling, what it is makes\r\nme act so to you sometimes, when I certainly ain\'t meaning anything\r\nlike I want to hurt you. I certainly don\'t mean to be so bad,\r\nMelanctha, only it comes so quick on me before I know what I am\r\nacting to you. I certainly am all sorry, hard, to be so bad to you,\r\nMelanctha, darling." "I suppose, Jeff," said Melanctha, very low and\r\nbitter, "I suppose you are always thinking, Jeff, somebody had ought\r\nto be ashamed with us two together, and you certainly do think you\r\ndon\'t see any way to it, Jeff, for me to be feeling that way ever, so\r\nyou certainly don\'t see any way to it, only to do it just so often\r\nfor me. That certainly is the way always with you, Jeff Campbell, if\r\nI understand you right the way you are always acting to me. That\r\ncertainly is right the way I am saying it to you now, Jeff Campbell.\r\nYou certainly didn\'t anyway trust me now no more, did you, when you\r\njust acted so bad to me. I certainly am right the way I say it Jeff\r\nnow to you. I certainly am right when I ask you for it now, to tell me\r\nwhat I ask you, about not trusting me more then again, Jeff, just like\r\nyou never really knew me. You certainly never did trust me just then,\r\nJeff, you hear me?" "Yes, Melanctha," Jeff answered slowly. Melanctha\r\npaused. "I guess I certainly never can forgive you this time, Jeff\r\nCampbell," she said firmly. Jeff paused too, and thought a little. "I\r\ncertainly am afraid you never can no more now again, Melanctha," he\r\nsaid sadly.\r\n\r\nThey lay there very quiet now a long time, each one thinking very hard\r\non their own trouble. At last Jeff began again to tell Melanctha\r\nwhat it was he was always thinking with her. "I certainly do know,\r\nMelanctha, you certainly now don\'t want any more to be hearing me\r\njust talking, but you see, Melanctha, really, it\'s just like this way\r\nalways with me. You see, Melanctha, its like this way now all the time\r\nwith me. You remember, Melanctha, what I was once telling to you, when\r\nI didn\'t know you very long together, about how I certainly never did\r\nknow more than just two kinds of ways of living, one way the way it is\r\ngood to be in families and the other kind of way, like animals are all\r\nthe time just with each other, and how I didn\'t ever like that last\r\nkind of way much for any of the colored people. You see Melanctha,\r\nit\'s like this way with me. I got a new feeling now, you been teaching\r\nto me, just like I told you once, just like a new religion to me,\r\nand I see perhaps what really loving is like, like really having\r\neverything together, new things, little pieces all different, like\r\nI always before been thinking was bad to be having, all go together\r\nlike, to make one good big feeling. You see, Melanctha, it\'s certainly\r\nlike that you make me been seeing, like I never know before any way\r\nthere was of all kinds of loving to come together to make one way\r\nreally truly lovely. I see that now, sometimes, the way you certainly\r\nbeen teaching me, Melanctha, really, and then I love you those times,\r\nMelanctha, like a real religion, and then it comes over me all sudden,\r\nI don\'t know anything real about you Melanctha, dear one, and then it\r\ncomes over me sudden, perhaps I certainly am wrong now, thinking all\r\nthis way so lovely, and not thinking now any more the old way I always\r\nbefore was always thinking, about what was the right way for me, to\r\nlive regular and all the colored people, and then I think, perhaps,\r\nMelanctha you are really just a bad one, and I think, perhaps I\r\ncertainly am doing it so because I just am too anxious to be just\r\nhaving all the time excitements, like I don\'t ever like really to be\r\ndoing when I know it, and then I always get so bad to you, Melanctha,\r\nand I can\'t help it with myself then, never, for I want to be always\r\nright really in the ways, I have to do them. I certainly do very badly\r\nwant to be right, Melanctha, the only way I know is right Melanctha\r\nreally, and I don\'t know any way, Melanctha, to find out really,\r\nwhether my old way, the way I always used to be thinking, or the new\r\nway, you make so like a real religion to me sometimes, Melanctha,\r\nwhich way certainly is the real right way for me to be always\r\nthinking, and then I certainly am awful good and sorry, Melanctha, I\r\nalways give you so much trouble, hurting you with the bad ways I am\r\nacting. Can\'t you help me to any way, to make it all straight for me,\r\nMelanctha, so I know right and real what it is I should be acting. You\r\nsee, Melanctha, I don\'t want always to be a coward with you, if I\r\nonly could know certain what was the right way for me to be acting.\r\nI certainly am real sure, Melanctha, that would be the way I would be\r\nacting, if I only knew it sure for certain now, Melanctha. Can\'t you\r\nhelp me any way to find out real and true, Melanctha, dear one. I\r\ncertainly do badly want to know always, the way I should be acting."\r\n\r\n"No, Jeff, dear, I certainly can\'t help you much in that kind of\r\ntrouble you are always having. All I can do now, Jeff, is to just keep\r\ncertainly with my believing you are good always, Jeff, and though you\r\ncertainly do hurt me bad, I always got strong faith in you, Jeff, more\r\nin you certainly, than you seem to be having in your acting to me,\r\nalways so bad, Jeff."\r\n\r\n"You certainly are very good to me, Melanctha, dear one," Jeff said,\r\nafter a long, tender silence. "You certainly are very good to me,\r\nMelanctha, darling, and me so bad to you always, in my acting. Do you\r\nlove me good, and right, Melanctha, always?" "Always and always,\r\nyou be sure of that now you have me. Oh you Jeff, you always be so\r\nstupid." "I certainly never can say now you ain\'t right, when you say\r\nthat to me so, Melanctha," Jeff answered. "Oh, Jeff dear, I love you\r\nalways, you know that now, all right, for certain. If you don\'t\r\nknow it right now, Jeff, really, I prove it to you now, for good and\r\nalways." And they lay there a long time in their loving, and then Jeff\r\nbegan again with his happy free enjoying.\r\n\r\n"I sure am a good boy to be learning all the time the right way you\r\nare teaching me, Melanctha, darling," began Jeff Campbell, laughing,\r\n"You can\'t say no, never, I ain\'t a good scholar for you to be\r\nteaching now, Melanctha, and I am always so ready to come to you\r\nevery day, and never playing hooky ever from you. You can\'t say ever,\r\nMelanctha, now can you, I ain\'t a real good boy to be always studying\r\nto be learning to be real bright, just like my teacher. You can\'t say\r\never to me, I ain\'t a good boy to you now, Melanctha." "Not near so\r\ngood, Jeff Campbell, as such a good, patient kind of teacher, like\r\nme, who never teaches any ways it ain\'t good her scholars should be\r\nknowing, ought to be really having, Jeff, you hear me? I certainly\r\ndon\'t think I am right for you, to be forgiving always, when you are\r\nso bad, and I so patient, with all this hard teaching always." "But\r\nyou do forgive me always, sure, Melanctha, always?" "Always and\r\nalways, you be sure Jeff, and I certainly am afraid I never can stop\r\nwith my forgiving, you always are going to be so bad to me, and I\r\nalways going to have to be so good with my forgiving." "Oh! Oh!" cried\r\nJeff Campbell, laughing, "I ain\'t going to be so bad for always, sure\r\nI ain\'t, Melanctha, my own darling. And sure you do forgive me really,\r\nand sure you love me true and really, sure, Melanctha?" "Sure, sure,\r\nJeff, boy, sure now and always, sure now you believe me, sure you\r\ndo, Jeff, always." "I sure hope I does, with all my heart, Melanctha,\r\ndarling." "I sure do that same, Jeff, dear boy, now you really know\r\nwhat it is to be loving, and I prove it to you now so, Jeff, you never\r\ncan be forgetting. You see now, Jeff, good and certain, what I always\r\nbefore been saying to you, Jeff, now." "Yes, Melanctha, darling,"\r\nmurmured Jeff, and he was very happy in it, and so the two of them now\r\nin the warm air of the sultry, southern, negro sunshine, lay there for\r\na long time just resting.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a real long time there was no open trouble any more\r\nbetween Jeff Campbell and Melanctha Herbert. Then it came that Jeff\r\nknew he could not say out any more, what it was he wanted, he could\r\nnot say out any more, what it was, he wanted to know about, what\r\nMelanctha wanted.\r\n\r\nMelanctha sometimes now, when she was tired with being all the time so\r\nmuch excited, when Jeff would talk a long time to her about what was\r\nright for them both to be always doing, would be, as if she gave way\r\nin her head, and lost herself in a bad feeling. Sometimes when they\r\nhad been strong in their loving, and Jeff would have rise inside him\r\nsome strange feeling, and Melanctha felt it in him as it would soon be\r\ncoming, she would lose herself then in this bad feeling that made her\r\nhead act as if she never knew what it was they were doing. And slowly\r\nnow, Jeff soon always came to be feeling that his Melanctha would be\r\nhurt very much in her head in the ways he never liked to think of, if\r\nshe would ever now again have to listen to his trouble, when he was\r\ntelling about what it was he still was wanting to make things for\r\nhimself really understanding.\r\n\r\nNow Jeff began to have always a strong feeling that Melanctha could no\r\nlonger stand it, with all her bad suffering, to let him fight out with\r\nhimself what was right for him to be doing. Now he felt he must not,\r\nwhen she was there with him, keep on, with this kind of fighting that\r\nwas always going on inside him. Jeff Campbell never knew yet, what he\r\nthought was the right way, for himself and for all the colored people\r\nto be living. Jeff was coming always each time closer to be really\r\nunderstanding, but now Melanctha was so bad in her suffering with him,\r\nthat he knew she could not any longer have him with her while he was\r\nalways showing that he never really yet was sure what it was, the\r\nright way, for them to be really loving.\r\n\r\nJeff saw now he had to go so fast, so that Melanctha never would have\r\nto wait any to get from him always all that she ever wanted. He never\r\ncould be honest now, he never could be now, any more, trying to be\r\nreally understanding, for always every moment now he felt it to be\r\na strong thing in him, how very much it was Melanctha Herbert always\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nJeff did not know very well these days, what it was, was really\r\nhappening to him. All he knew every now and then, when they were\r\ngetting strong to get excited, the way they used to when he gave his\r\nfeeling out so that he could be always honest, that Melanctha somehow\r\nnever seemed to hear him, she just looked at him and looked as if\r\nher head hurt with him, and then Jeff had to keep himself from being\r\nhonest, and he had to go so fast, and to do everything Melanctha ever\r\nwanted from him.\r\n\r\nJeff did not like it very well these days, in his true feeling. He\r\nknew now very well Melanctha was not strong enough inside her to stand\r\nany more of his slow way of doing. And yet now he knew he was not\r\nhonest in his feeling. Now he always had to show more to Melanctha\r\nthan he was ever feeling. Now she made him go so fast, and he knew it\r\nwas not real with his feeling, and yet he could not make her suffer so\r\nany more because he always was so slow with his feeling.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard for Jeff Campbell to make all this way of doing,\r\nright, inside him. If Jeff Campbell could not be straight out, and\r\nreal honest, he never could be very strong inside him. Now Melanctha,\r\nwith her making him feel, always, how good she was and how very much\r\nshe suffered in him, made him always go so fast then, he could not be\r\nstrong then, to feel things out straight then inside him. Always now\r\nwhen he was with her, he was being more, than he could already yet,\r\nbe feeling for her. Always now, with her, he had something inside him\r\nalways holding in him, always now, with her, he was far ahead of his\r\nown feeling.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell never knew very well these days what it was that was\r\ngoing on inside him. All he knew was, he was uneasy now always to be\r\nwith Melanctha. All he knew was, that he was always uneasy when he\r\nwas with Melanctha, not the way he used to be from just not being very\r\nunderstanding, but now, because he never could be honest with her,\r\nbecause he was now always feeling her strong suffering, in her,\r\nbecause he knew now he was having a straight, good feeling with her,\r\nbut she went so fast, and he was so slow to her; Jeff knew his right\r\nfeeling never got a chance to show itself as strong, to her.\r\n\r\nAll this was always getting harder for Jeff Campbell. He was very\r\nproud to hold himself to be strong, was Jeff Campbell. He was very\r\ntender not to hurt Melanctha, when he knew she would be sure to feel\r\nit badly in her head a long time after, he hated that he could not now\r\nbe honest with her, he wanted to stay away to work it out all alone,\r\nwithout her, he was afraid she would feel it to suffer, if he kept\r\naway now from her. He was uneasy always, with her, he was uneasy when\r\nhe thought about her, he knew now he had a good, straight, strong\r\nfeeling of right loving for her, and yet now he never could use it to\r\nbe good and honest with her.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell did not know, these days, anything he could do to\r\nmake it better for her. He did not know anything he could do, to set\r\nhimself really right in his acting and his thinking toward her. She\r\npulled him so fast with her, and he did not dare to hurt her, and he\r\ncould not come right, so fast, the way she always needed he should be\r\ndoing it now, for her.\r\n\r\nThese days were not very joyful ones now any more, to Jeff Campbell,\r\nwith Melanctha. He did not think it out to himself now, in words,\r\nabout her. He did not know enough, what was his real trouble, with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSometimes now and again with them, and with all this trouble for a\r\nlittle while well forgotten by him, Jeff, and Melanctha with him,\r\nwould be very happy in a strong, sweet loving. Sometimes then,\r\nJeff would find himself to be soaring very high in his true loving.\r\nSometimes Jeff would find them, in his loving, his soul swelling out\r\nfull inside him. Always Jeff felt now in himself, deep feeling.\r\n\r\nAlways now Jeff had to go so much faster than was real with his\r\nfeeling. Yet always Jeff knew how he had a right, strong feeling.\r\nAlways now when Jeff was wondering, it was Melanctha he was doubting,\r\nin the loving. Now he would often ask her, was she real now to him, in\r\nher loving. He would ask her often, feeling something queer about it\r\nall inside him, though yet he was never really strong in his doubting,\r\nand always Melanctha would answer to him, "Yes Jeff, sure, you know\r\nit, always," and always Jeff felt a doubt now, in her loving.\r\n\r\nAlways now Jeff felt in himself, deep loving. Always now he did not\r\nknow really, if Melanctha was true in her loving.\r\n\r\nAll these days Jeff was uncertain in him, and he was uneasy about\r\nwhich way he should act so as not to be wrong and put them both into\r\nbad trouble. Always now he was, as if he must feel deep into Melanctha\r\nto see if it was real loving he would find she now had in her, and\r\nalways he would stop himself, with her, for always he was afraid now\r\nthat he might badly hurt her.\r\n\r\nAlways now he liked it better when he was detained when he had to go\r\nand see her. Always now he never liked to go to be with her, although\r\nhe never wanted really, not to be always with her. Always now he\r\nnever felt really at ease with her, even when they were good friends\r\ntogether. Always now he felt, with her, he could not be really honest\r\nto her. And Jeff never could be happy with her when he could not feel\r\nstrong to tell all his feeling to her. Always now every day he found\r\nit harder to make the time pass, with her, and not let his feeling\r\ncome so that he would quarrel with her.\r\n\r\nAnd so one evening, late, he was to go to her. He waited a little\r\nlong, before he went to her. He was afraid, in himself, to-night, he\r\nwould surely hurt her. He never wanted to go when he might quarrel\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha sat there looking very angry, when he came in to her. Jeff\r\ntook off his hat and coat and then sat down by the fire with her.\r\n\r\n"If you come in much later to me just now, Jeff Campbell, I certainly\r\nnever would have seen you no more never to speak to you, \'thout your\r\napologising real humble to me." "Apologising Melanctha," and Jeff\r\nlaughed and was scornful to her, "Apologising, Melanctha, I ain\'t\r\nproud that kind of way, Melanctha, I don\'t mind apologising to you,\r\nMelanctha, all I mind, Melanctha is to be doing of things wrong, to\r\nyou." "That\'s easy, to say things that way, Jeff to me. But you never\r\nwas very proud Jeff, to be courageous to me." "I don\'t know about that\r\nMelanctha. I got courage to say some things hard, when I mean them, to\r\nyou." "Oh, yes, Jeff, I know all about that, Jeff, to me. But I mean\r\nreal courage, to run around and not care nothing about what happens,\r\nand always to be game in any kind of trouble. That\'s what I mean\r\nby real courage, to me, Jeff, if you want to know it." "Oh, yes,\r\nMelanctha, I know all that kind of courage. I see plenty of it all\r\nthe time with some kinds of colored men and with some girls like you\r\nMelanctha, and Jane Harden. I know all about how you are always making\r\na fuss to be proud because you don\'t holler so much when you run in to\r\nwhere you ain\'t got any business to be, and so you get hurt, the way\r\nyou ought to. And then, you kind of people are very brave then, sure,\r\nwith all your kinds of suffering, but the way I see it, going round\r\nwith all my patients, that kind of courage makes all kind of trouble,\r\nfor them who ain\'t so noble with their courage, and then they got it,\r\nalways to be bearing it, when the end comes, to be hurt the hardest.\r\nIt\'s like running around and being game to spend all your money\r\nalways, and then a man\'s wife and children are the ones do all the\r\nstarving and they don\'t ever get a name for being brave, and they\r\ndon\'t ever want to be doing all that suffering, and they got to stand\r\nit and say nothing. That\'s the way I see it a good deal now with all\r\nthat kind of braveness in some of the colored people. They always make\r\na lot of noise to show they are so brave not to holler, when they got\r\nso much suffering they always bring all on themselves, just by\r\ndoing things they got no business to be doing. I don\'t say, never,\r\nMelanctha, they ain\'t got good courage not to holler, but I never did\r\nsee much in looking for that kind of trouble just to show you ain\'t\r\ngoing to holler. No its all right being brave every day, just living\r\nregular and not having new ways all the time just to get excitements,\r\nthe way I hate to see it in all the colored people. No I don\'t see\r\nmuch, Melanctha, in being brave just to get it good, where you\'ve\r\ngot no business. I ain\'t ashamed Melanctha, right here to tell you, I\r\nain\'t ashamed ever to say I ain\'t got no longing to be brave, just\r\nto go around and look for trouble." "Yes that\'s just like you always,\r\nJeff, you never understand things right, the way you are always\r\nfeeling in you. You ain\'t got no way to understand right, how it\r\ndepends what way somebody goes to look for new things, the way it\r\nmakes it right for them to get excited."\r\n\r\n"No Melanctha, I certainly never do say I understand much anybody\'s\r\ngot a right to think they won\'t have real bad trouble, if they go and\r\nlook hard where they are certain sure to find it. No Melanctha, it\r\ncertainly does sound very pretty all this talking about danger and\r\nbeing game and never hollering, and all that way of talking, but when\r\ntwo men are just fighting, the strong man mostly gets on top with\r\ndoing good hard pounding, and the man that\'s getting all that\r\npounding, he mostly never likes it so far as I have been able yet to\r\nsee it, and I don\'t see much difference what kind of noble way they\r\nare made of when they ain\'t got any kind of business to get together\r\nthere to be fighting. That certainly is the only way I ever see it\r\nhappen right, Melanctha, whenever I happen to be anywhere I can be\r\nlooking."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you never can see anything that ain\'t just so simple,\r\nJeff, with everybody, the way you always think it. It do make all\r\nthe difference the kind of way anybody is made to do things game Jeff\r\nCampbell."\r\n\r\n"Maybe Melanctha, I certainly never say no you ain\'t right, Melanctha.\r\nI just been telling it to you all straight, Melanctha, the way I\r\nalways see it. Perhaps if you run around where you ain\'t got any\r\nbusiness, and you stand up very straight and say, I am so brave,\r\nnothing can ever ever hurt me, maybe nothing will ever hurt you then\r\nMelanctha. I never have seen it do so. I never can say truly any\r\ndifferently to you Melanctha, but I always am ready to be learning\r\nfrom you, Melanctha. And perhaps when somebody cuts into you real\r\nhard, with a brick he is throwing, perhaps you never will do any\r\nhollering then, Melanctha. I certainly don\'t ever say no, Melanctha,\r\nto you, I only say that ain\'t the way yet I ever see it happen when I\r\nhad a chance to be there looking."\r\n\r\nThey sat there together, quiet by the fire, and they did not seem to\r\nfeel very loving.\r\n\r\n"I certainly do wonder," Melanctha said dreamily, at last breaking\r\ninto their long unloving silence. "I certainly do wonder why always it\r\nhappens to me I care for anybody who ain\'t no ways good enough for me\r\never to be thinking to respect him."\r\n\r\nJeff looked at Melanctha. Jeff got up then and walked a little up and\r\ndown the room, and then he came back, and his face was set and dark\r\nand he was very quiet to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, Jeff, sure, why you look so solemn now to me. Sure Jeff I\r\nnever am meaning anything real by what I just been saying. What was I\r\njust been saying Jeff to you. I only certainly was just thinking how\r\neverything always was just happening to me."\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell sat very still and dark, and made no answer.\r\n\r\n"Seems to me, Jeff you might be good to me a little to-night when my\r\nhead hurts so, and I am so tired with all the hard work I have been\r\ndoing, thinking, and I always got so many things to be a trouble to\r\nme, living like I do with nobody ever who can help me. Seems to me\r\nyou might be good to me Jeff to-night, and not get angry, every little\r\nthing I am ever saying to you."\r\n\r\n"I certainly would not get angry ever with you, Melanctha, just\r\nbecause you say things to me. But now I certainly been thinking you\r\nreally mean what you have been just then saying to me." "But you say\r\nall the time to me Jeff, you ain\'t no ways good enough in your loving\r\nto me, you certainly say to me all the time you ain\'t no ways good\r\nor understanding to me." "That certainly is what I say to you always,\r\njust the way I feel it to you Melanctha always, and I got it right in\r\nme to say it, and I have got a right in me to be very strong and feel\r\nit, and to be always sure to believe it, but it ain\'t right for you\r\nMelanctha to feel it. When you feel it so Melanctha, it does certainly\r\nmake everything all wrong with our loving. It makes it so I certainly\r\nnever can bear to have it."\r\n\r\nThey sat there then a long time by the fire, very silent, and not\r\nloving, and never looking to each other for it. Melanctha was moving\r\nand twitching herself and very nervous with it. Jeff was heavy and\r\nsullen and dark and very serious in it.\r\n\r\n"Oh why can\'t you forget I said it to you Jeff now, and I certainly am\r\nso tired, and my head and all now with it."\r\n\r\nJeff stirred, "All right Melanctha, don\'t you go make yourself sick\r\nnow in your head, feeling so bad with it," and Jeff made himself do\r\nit, and he was a patient doctor again now with Melanctha when he felt\r\nher really having her head hurt with it. "It\'s all right now Melanctha\r\ndarling, sure it is now I tell you. You just lie down now a little,\r\ndear one, and I sit here by the fire and just read awhile and just\r\nwatch with you so I will be here ready, if you need me to give you\r\nsomething to help you resting." And then Jeff was a good doctor to\r\nher, and very sweet and tender with her, and Melanctha loved him to be\r\nthere to help her, and then Melanctha fell asleep a little, and Jeff\r\nwaited there beside her until he saw she was really sleeping, and then\r\nhe went back and sat down by the fire.\r\n\r\nAnd Jeff tried to begin again with his thinking, and he could not\r\nmake it come clear to himself, with all his thinking, and he felt\r\neverything all thick and heavy and bad, now inside him, everything\r\nthat he could not understand right, with all the hard work he made,\r\nwith his thinking. And then he moved himself a little, and took a book\r\nto forget his thinking, and then as always, he loved it when he was\r\nreading, and then very soon he was deep in his reading, and so he\r\nforgot now for a little while that he never could seem to be very\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAnd so Jeff forgot himself for awhile in his reading, and Melanctha\r\nwas sleeping. And then Melanctha woke up and she was screaming. "Oh,\r\nJeff, I thought you gone away for always from me. Oh, Jeff, never now\r\ngo away no more from me. Oh, Jeff, sure, sure, always be just so good\r\nto me"\r\n\r\nThere was a weight in Jeff Campbell from now on, always with him, that\r\nhe could never lift out from him, to feel easy. He always was trying\r\nnot to have it in him and he always was trying not to let Melanctha\r\nfeel it, with him, but it was always there inside him. Now Jeff\r\nCampbell always was serious, and dark, and heavy, and sullen, and he\r\nwould often sit a long time with Melanctha without moving.\r\n\r\n"You certainly never have forgiven to me, what I said to you that\r\nnight, Jeff, now have you?" Melanctha asked him after a long silence,\r\nlate one evening with him. "It ain\'t ever with me a question like\r\nforgiving, Melanctha, I got in me. It\'s just only what you are feeling\r\nfor me, makes any difference to me. I ain\'t ever seen anything since\r\nin you, makes me think you didn\'t mean it right, what you said about\r\nnot thinking now any more I was good, to make it right for you to be\r\nreally caring so very much to love me."\r\n\r\n"I certainly never did see no man like you, Jeff. You always wanting\r\nto have it all clear out in words always, what everybody is always\r\nfeeling. I certainly don\'t see a reason, why I should always be\r\nexplaining to you what I mean by what I am just saying. And you ain\'t\r\ngot no feeling ever for me, to ask me what I meant, by what I was\r\nsaying when I was so tired, that night. I never know anything right I\r\nwas saying." "But you don\'t ever tell me now, Melanctha, so I really\r\nhear you say it, you don\'t mean it the same way, the way you said it\r\nto me." "Oh Jeff, you so stupid always to me and always just bothering\r\nwith your always asking to me. And I don\'t never any way remember ever\r\nanything I been saying to you, and I am always my head, so it hurts\r\nme it half kills me, and my heart jumps so, sometimes I think I die\r\nso when it hurts me, and I am so blue always, I think sometimes I take\r\nsomething to just kill me, and I got so much to bother thinking always\r\nand doing, and I got so much to worry, and all that, and then you come\r\nand ask me what I mean by what I was just saying to you. I certainly\r\ndon\'t know, Jeff, when you ask me. Seems to me, Jeff, sometimes you\r\nmight have some kind of a right feeling to be careful to me." "You\r\nain\'t got no right Melanctha Herbert," flashed out Jeff through his\r\ndark, frowning anger, "you certainly ain\'t got no right always to be\r\nusing your being hurt and being sick, and having pain, like a weapon,\r\nso as to make me do things it ain\'t never right for me to be doing for\r\nyou. You certainly ain\'t got no right to be always holding your pain\r\nout to show me." "What do you mean by them words, Jeff Campbell." "I\r\ncertainly do mean them just like I am saying them, Melanctha. You\r\nact always, like I been responsible all myself for all our loving one\r\nanother. And if its anything anyway that ever hurts you, you act like\r\nas if it was me made you just begin it all with me. I ain\'t no coward,\r\nyou hear me, Melanctha? I never put my trouble back on anybody,\r\nthinking that they made me. I certainly am right ready always,\r\nMelanctha, you certainly had ought to know me, to stand all my own\r\ntrouble for me, but I tell you straight now, the way I think it\r\nMelanctha, I ain\'t going to be as if I was the reason why you wanted\r\nto be loving, and to be suffering so now with me." "But ain\'t you\r\ncertainly ought to be feeling it so, to be right, Jeff Campbell. Did I\r\never do anything but just let you do everything you wanted to me. Did\r\nI ever try to make you be loving to me. Did I ever do nothing except\r\njust sit there ready to endure your loving with me. But I certainly\r\nnever, Jeff Campbell, did make any kind of way as if I wanted really\r\nto be having you for me."\r\n\r\nJeff stared at Melanctha. "So that\'s the way you say it when you are\r\nthinking right about it all, Melanctha. Well I certainly ain\'t got\r\na word to say ever to you any more, Melanctha, if that\'s the way its\r\nstraight out to you now, Melanctha." And Jeff almost laughed out to\r\nher, and he turned to take his hat and coat, and go away now forever\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha dropped her head on her arms, and she trembled all over and\r\ninside her. Jeff stopped a little and looked very sadly at her. Jeff\r\ncould not so quickly make it right for himself, to leave her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I certainly shall go crazy now, I certainly know that," Melanctha\r\nmoaned as she sat there, all fallen and miserable and weak together.\r\n\r\nJeff came and took her in his arms, and held her. Jeff was very good\r\nthen to her, but they neither of them felt inside all right, as they\r\nonce did, to be together.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, Jeff had real torment in him.\r\n\r\nWas it true what Melanctha had said that night to him? Was it true\r\nthat he was the one had made all this trouble for them? Was it true,\r\nhe was the only one, who always had had wrong ways in him? Waking or\r\nsleeping Jeff now always had this torment going on inside him.\r\n\r\nJeff did not know now any more, what to feel within him. He did not\r\nknow how to begin thinking out this trouble that must always now be\r\nbad inside him. He just felt a confused struggle and resentment always\r\nin him, a knowing, no, Melanctha was not right in what she had said\r\nthat night to him, and then a feeling, perhaps he always had been\r\nwrong in the way he never could be understanding. And then would come\r\nstrong to him, a sense of the deep sweetness in Melanctha\'s loving and\r\na hating the cold slow way he always had to feel things in him.\r\n\r\nAlways Jeff knew, sure, Melanctha was wrong in what she had said that\r\nnight to him, but always Melanctha had had deep feeling with him,\r\nalways he was poor and slow in the only way he knew how to have any\r\nfeeling. Jeff knew Melanctha was wrong, and yet he always had a deep\r\ndoubt in him. What could he know, who had such slow feeling in him?\r\nWhat could he ever know, who always had to find his way with just\r\nthinking. What could he know, who had to be taught such a long time to\r\nlearn about what was really loving? Jeff now always had this torment\r\nin him.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was now always making him feel her way, strong whenever she\r\nwas with him. Did she go on to do it just to show him, did she do it\r\nso now because she was no longer loving, did she do it so because that\r\nwas her way to make him be really loving. Jeff never did know how it\r\nwas that it all happened so to him.\r\n\r\nMelanctha acted now the way she had said it always had been with them.\r\nNow it was always Jeff who had to do the asking. Now it was always\r\nJeff who had to ask when would be the next time he should come to see\r\nher. Now always she was good and patient to him, and now always she\r\nwas kind and loving with him, and always Jeff felt it was, that she\r\nwas good to give him anything he ever asked or wanted, but never now\r\nany more for her own sake to make her happy in him. Now she did these\r\nthings, as if it was just to please her Jeff Campbell who needed she\r\nshould now have kindness for him. Always now he was the beggar, with\r\nthem. Always now Melanctha gave it, not of her need, but from her\r\nbounty to him. Always now Jeff found it getting harder for him.\r\n\r\nSometimes Jeff wanted to tear things away from before him, always\r\nnow he wanted to fight things and be angry with them, and always now\r\nMelanctha was so patient to him.\r\n\r\nNow, deep inside him, there was always a doubt with Jeff, of\r\nMelanctha\'s loving. It was not a doubt yet to make him really\r\ndoubting, for with that, Jeff never could be really loving, but always\r\nnow he knew that something, and that not in him, something was wrong\r\nwith their loving. Jeff Campbell could not know any right way to think\r\nout what was inside Melanctha with her loving, he could not use any\r\nway now to reach inside her to find if she was true in her loving, but\r\nnow something had gone wrong between them, and now he never felt sure\r\nin him, the way once she had made him, that now at last he really had\r\ngot to be understanding.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was too many for him. He was helpless to find out the way\r\nshe really felt now for him. Often Jeff would ask her, did she really\r\nlove him. Always she said, "Yes Jeff, sure, you know that," and now\r\ninstead of a full sweet strong love with it, Jeff only felt a patient,\r\nkind endurance in it.\r\n\r\nJeff did not know. If he was right in such a feeling, he certainly\r\nnever any more did want to have Melanctha Herbert with him. Jeff\r\nCampbell hated badly to think Melanctha never would give him love,\r\njust for his sake, and not because she needed it herself, to be with\r\nhim. Such a way of loving would be very hard for Jeff to be enduring.\r\n\r\n"Jeff what makes you act so funny to me. Jeff you certainly now are\r\njealous to me. Sure Jeff, now I don\'t see ever why you be so foolish\r\nto look so to me." "Don\'t you ever think I can be jealous of anybody\r\never Melanctha, you hear me. It\'s just, you certainly don\'t ever\r\nunderstand me. It\'s just this way with me always now Melanctha. You\r\nlove me, and I don\'t care anything what you do or what you ever been\r\nto anybody. You don\'t love me, then I don\'t care any more about what\r\nyou ever do or what you ever be to anybody. But I never want you to be\r\nbeing good Melanctha to me, when it ain\'t your loving makes you need\r\nit. I certainly don\'t ever want to be having any of your kind of\r\nkindness to me. If you don\'t love me, I can stand it. All I never want\r\nto have is your being good to me from kindness. If you don\'t love\r\nme, then you and I certainly do quit right here Melanctha, all strong\r\nfeeling, to be always living to each other. It certainly never\r\nis anybody I ever am thinking about when I am thinking with you\r\nMelanctha, darling. That\'s the true way I am telling you Melanctha,\r\nalways. It\'s only your loving me ever gives me anything to bother me\r\nMelanctha, so all you got to do, if you don\'t really love me, is just\r\ncertainly to say so to me. I won\'t bother you more then than I can\r\nhelp to keep from it Melanctha. You certainly need never to be in\r\nany worry, never, about me Melanctha. You just tell me straight out\r\nMelanctha, real, the way you feel it. I certainly can stand it all\r\nright, I tell you true Melanctha. And I never will care to know why or\r\nnothing Melanctha. Loving is just living Melanctha to me, and if you\r\ndon\'t really feel it now Melanctha to me, there ain\'t ever nothing\r\nbetween us then Melanctha, is there? That\'s straight and honest just\r\nthe way I always feel it to you now Melanctha. Oh Melanctha, darling,\r\ndo you love me? Oh Melanctha, please, please, tell me honest, tell me,\r\ndo you really love me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh you so stupid Jeff boy, of course I always love you. Always and\r\nalways Jeff and I always just so good to you. Oh you so stupid Jeff\r\nand don\'t know when you got it good with me. Oh dear, Jeff I certainly\r\nam so tired Jeff to-night, don\'t you go be a bother to me. Yes I love\r\nyou Jeff, how often you want me to tell you. Oh you so stupid Jeff,\r\nbut yes I love you. Now I won\'t say it no more now tonight Jeff, you\r\nhear me. You just be good Jeff now to me or else I certainly get awful\r\nangry with you. Yes I love you, sure, Jeff, though you don\'t any way\r\ndeserve it from me. Yes, yes I love you. Yes Jeff I say it till I\r\ncertainly am very sleepy. Yes I love you now Jeff, and you certainly\r\nmust stop asking me to tell you. Oh you great silly boy Jeff Campbell,\r\nsure I love you, oh you silly stupid, my own boy Jeff Campbell. Yes\r\nI love you and I certainly never won\'t say it one more time to-night\r\nJeff, now you hear me."\r\n\r\nYes Jeff Campbell heard her, and he tried hard to believe her. He did\r\nnot really doubt her but somehow it was wrong now, the way Melanctha\r\nsaid it. Jeff always now felt baffled with Melanctha. Something, he\r\nknew, was not right now in her. Something in her always now was making\r\nstronger the torment that was tearing every minute at the joy he once\r\nalways had had with her.\r\n\r\nAlways now Jeff wondered did Melanctha love him. Always now he was\r\nwondering, was Melanctha right when she said, it was he had made all\r\ntheir beginning. Was Melanctha right when she said, it was he had the\r\nreal responsibility for all the trouble they had and still were having\r\nnow between them. If she was right, what a brute he always had been in\r\nhis acting. If she was right, how good she had been to endure the\r\npain he had made so bad so often for her. But no, surely she had made\r\nherself to bear it, for her own sake, not for his to make him happy.\r\nSurely he was not so twisted in all his long thinking. Surely he\r\ncould remember right what it was had happened every day in their long\r\nloving. Surely he was not so poor a coward as Melanctha always seemed\r\nto be thinking. Surely, surely, and then the torment would get worse\r\nevery minute in him.\r\n\r\nOne night Jeff Campbell was lying in his bed with his thinking, and\r\nnight after night now he could not do any sleeping for his thinking.\r\nTonight suddenly he sat up in his bed, and it all came clear to him,\r\nand he pounded his pillow with his fist, and he almost shouted out\r\nalone there to him, "I ain\'t a brute the way Melanctha has been\r\nsaying. Its all wrong the way I been worried thinking. We did begin\r\nfair, each not for the other but for ourselves, what we were wanting.\r\nMelanctha Herbert did it just like I did it, because she liked it bad\r\nenough to want to stand it. It\'s all wrong in me to think it any way\r\nexcept the way we really did it. I certainly don\'t know now whether\r\nshe is now real and true in her loving. I ain\'t got any way ever to\r\nfind out if she is real and true now always to me. All I know is I\r\ndidn\'t ever make her to begin to be with me. Melanctha has got\r\nto stand for her own trouble, just like I got to stand for my own\r\ntrouble. Each man has got to do it for himself when he is in real\r\ntrouble. Melanctha, she certainly don\'t remember right when she says\r\nI made her begin and then I made her trouble. No by God, I ain\'t\r\nno coward nor a brute either ever to her. I been the way I felt\r\nit honest, and that certainly is all about it now between us, and\r\neverybody always has just got to stand for their own trouble. I\r\ncertainly am right this time the way I see it." And Jeff lay down\r\nnow, at last in comfort, and he slept, and he was free from his long\r\ndoubting torment.\r\n\r\n"You know Melanctha," Jeff Campbell began, the next time he was alone\r\nto talk a long time to Melanctha. "You know Melanctha, sometimes I\r\nthink a whole lot about what you like to say so much about being game\r\nand never doing any hollering. Seems to me Melanctha, I certainly\r\ndon\'t understand right what you mean by not hollering. Seems to me\r\nit certainly ain\'t only what comes right away when one is hit, that\r\ncounts to be brave to be bearing, but all that comes later from your\r\ngetting sick from the shock of being hurt once in a fight, and\r\nall that, and all the being taken care of for years after, and the\r\nsuffering of your family, and all that, you certainly must stand and\r\nnot holler, to be certainly really brave the way I understand it."\r\n"What you mean Jeff by your talking." "I mean, seems to me really not\r\nto holler, is to be strong not to show you ever have been hurt. Seems\r\nto me, to get your head hurt from your trouble and to show it, ain\'t\r\ncertainly no braver than to say, oh, oh, how bad you hurt me, please\r\ndon\'t hurt me mister. It just certainly seems to me, like many people\r\nthink themselves so game just to stand what we all of us always just\r\ngot to be standing, and everybody stands it, and we don\'t certainly\r\nnone of us like it, and yet we don\'t ever most of us think we are so\r\nmuch being game, just because we got to stand it."\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean now by what you are saying to me now Jeff\r\nCampbell. You make a fuss now to me, because I certainly just have\r\nstopped standing everything you like to be always doing so cruel to\r\nme. But that\'s just the way always with you Jeff Campbell, if you want\r\nto know it. You ain\'t got no kind of right feeling for all I always\r\nbeen forgiving to you." "I said it once for fun, Melanctha, but now I\r\ncertainly do mean it, you think you got a right to go where you got\r\nno business, and you say, I am so brave nothing can hurt me, and then\r\nsomething, like always, it happens to hurt you, and you show your hurt\r\nalways so everybody can see it, and you say, I am so brave nothing did\r\nhurt me except he certainly didn\'t have any right to, and see how\r\nbad I suffer, but you never hear me make a holler, though certainly\r\nanybody got any feeling, to see me suffer, would certainly never touch\r\nme except to take good care of me. Sometimes I certainly don\'t rightly\r\nsee Melanctha, how much more game that is than just the ordinary kind\r\nof holler." "No, Jeff Campbell, and made the way you is you certainly\r\nain\'t likely ever to be much more understanding." "No, Melanctha, nor\r\nyou neither. You think always, you are the only one who ever can do\r\nany way to really suffer." "Well, and ain\'t I certainly always been\r\nthe only person knows how to bear it. No, Jeff Campbell, I certainly\r\nbe glad to love anybody really worthy, but I made so, I never seem\r\nto be able in this world to find him." "No, and your kind of way of\r\nthinking, you certainly Melanctha never going to any way be able ever\r\nto be finding of him. Can\'t you understand Melanctha, ever, how no man\r\ncertainly ever really can hold your love for long times together.\r\nYou certainly Melanctha, you ain\'t got down deep loyal feeling, true\r\ninside you, and when you ain\'t just that moment quick with feeling,\r\nthen you certainly ain\'t ever got anything more there to keep you.\r\nYou see Melanctha, it certainly is this way with you, it is, that\r\nyou ain\'t ever got any way to remember right what you been doing, or\r\nanybody else that has been feeling with you. You certainly Melanctha,\r\nnever can remember right, when it comes what you have done and what\r\nyou think happens to you." "It certainly is all easy for you Jeff\r\nCampbell to be talking. You remember right, because you don\'t remember\r\nnothing till you get home with your thinking everything all over, but\r\nI certainly don\'t think much ever of that kind of way of remembering\r\nright, Jeff Campbell. I certainly do call it remembering right Jeff\r\nCampbell, to remember right just when it happens to you, so you have a\r\nright kind of feeling not to act the way you always been doing to me,\r\nand then you go home Jeff Campbell, and you begin with your thinking,\r\nand then it certainly is very easy for you to be good and forgiving\r\nwith it. No, that ain\'t to me, the way of remembering Jeff Campbell,\r\nnot as I can see it not to make people always suffer, waiting for you\r\ncertainly to get to do it. Seems to me like Jeff Campbell, I never\r\ncould feel so like a man was low and to be scorning of him, like that\r\nday in the summer, when you threw me off just because you got one of\r\nthose fits of your remembering. No, Jeff Campbell, its real feeling\r\nevery moment when its needed, that certainly does seem to me like real\r\nremembering. And that way, certainly, you don\'t never know nothing\r\nlike what should be right Jeff Campbell. No Jeff, it\'s me that always\r\ncertainly has had to bear it with you. It\'s always me that certainly\r\nhas had to suffer, while you go home to remember. No you certainly\r\nain\'t got no sense yet Jeff, what you need to make you really feeling.\r\nNo, it certainly is me Jeff Campbell, that always has got to be\r\nremembering for us both, always. That\'s what\'s the true way with us\r\nJeff Campbell, if you want to know what it is I am always thinking."\r\n"You is certainly real modest Melanctha, when you do this kind of\r\ntalking, you sure is Melanctha," said Jeff Campbell laughing. "I\r\nthink sometimes Melanctha I am certainly awful conceited, when I think\r\nsometimes I am all out doors, and I think I certainly am so bright,\r\nand better than most everybody I ever got anything now to do with, but\r\nwhen I hear you talk this way Melanctha, I certainly do think I am a\r\nreal modest kind of fellow." "Modest!" said Melanctha, angry, "Modest,\r\nthat certainly is a queer thing for you Jeff to be calling yourself\r\neven when you are laughing." "Well it certainly does depend a whole\r\nlot what you are thinking with," said Jeff Campbell. "I never did use\r\nto think I was so much on being real modest Melanctha, but now I know\r\nreally I am, when I hear you talking. I see all the time there are\r\nmany people living just as good as I am, though they are a little\r\ndifferent to me. Now with you Melanctha if I understand you right what\r\nyou are talking, you don\'t think that way of no other one that you are\r\never knowing." "I certainly could be real modest too, Jeff Campbell,"\r\nsaid Melanctha, "If I could meet somebody once I could keep right\r\non respecting when I got so I was really knowing with them. But I\r\ncertainly never met anybody like that yet, Jeff Campbell, if you want\r\nto know it." "No, Melanctha, and with the way you got of thinking,\r\nit certainly don\'t look like as if you ever will Melanctha, with your\r\nnever remembering anything only what you just then are feeling in you,\r\nand you not understanding what any one else is ever feeling, if they\r\ndon\'t holler just the way you are doing. No Melanctha, I certainly\r\ndon\'t see any ways you are likely ever to meet one, so good as you are\r\nalways thinking you be." "No, Jeff Campbell, it certainly ain\'t\r\nthat way with me at all the way you say it. It\'s because I am always\r\nknowing what it is I am wanting, when I get it. I certainly don\'t\r\nnever have to wait till I have it, and then throw away what I got in\r\nme, and then come back and say, that\'s a mistake I just been making,\r\nit ain\'t that never at all like I understood it, I want to have, bad,\r\nwhat I didn\'t think it was I wanted. It\'s that way of knowing right\r\nwhat I am wanting, makes me feel nobody can come right with me, when I\r\nam feeling things, Jeff Campbell. I certainly do say Jeff Campbell, I\r\ncertainly don\'t think much of the way you always do it, always never\r\nknowing what it is you are ever really wanting and everybody always\r\ngot to suffer. No Jeff, I don\'t certainly think there is much doubting\r\nwhich is better and the stronger with us two, Jeff Campbell."\r\n\r\n"As you will, Melanctha Herbert," cried Jeff Campbell, and he rose up,\r\nand he thundered out a black oath, and he was fierce to leave her now\r\nforever, and then with the same movement, he took her in his arms and\r\nheld her.\r\n\r\n"What a silly goose boy you are, Jeff Campbell," Melanctha whispered\r\nto him fondly.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Jeff, very dreary. "I never could keep really mad with\r\nanybody, not when I was a little boy and playing. I used most to cry\r\nsometimes, I couldn\'t get real mad and keep on a long time with\r\nit, the way everybody always did it. It\'s certainly no use to me\r\nMelanctha, I certainly can\'t ever keep mad with you Melanctha, my dear\r\none. But don\'t you ever be thinking it\'s because I think you right\r\nin what you been just saying to me. I don\'t Melanctha really think it\r\nthat way, honest, though I certainly can\'t get mad the way I ought to.\r\nNo Melanctha, little girl, really truly, you ain\'t right the way you\r\nthink it. I certainly do know that Melanctha, honest. You certainly\r\ndon\'t do me right Melanctha, the way you say you are thinking.\r\nGood-bye Melanctha, though you certainly is my own little girl for\r\nalways." And then they were very good a little to each other, and then\r\nJeff went away for that evening, from her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha had begun now once more to wander. Melanctha did not yet\r\nalways wander, but a little now she needed to begin to look for\r\nothers. Now Melanctha Herbert began again to be with some of the\r\nbetter kind of black girls, and with them she sometimes wandered.\r\nMelanctha had not yet come again to need to be alone, when she\r\nwandered.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell did not know that Melanctha had begun again to wander.\r\nAll Jeff knew, was that now he could not be so often with her.\r\n\r\nJeff never knew how it had come to happen to him, but now he never\r\nthought to go to see Melanctha Herbert, until he had before, asked\r\nher if she could be going to have time then to have him with her. Then\r\nMelanctha would think a little, and then she would say to him, "Let me\r\nsee Jeff, to-morrow, you was just saying to me. I certainly am awful\r\nbusy you know Jeff just now. It certainly does seem to me this week\r\nJeff, I can\'t anyways fix it. Sure I want to see you soon Jeff. I\r\ncertainly Jeff got to do a little more now, I been giving so much\r\ntime, when I had no business, just to be with you when you asked me.\r\nNow I guess Jeff, I certainly can\'t see you no more this week Jeff,\r\nthe way I got to do things." "All right Melanctha," Jeff would answer\r\nand he would be very angry. "I want to come only just certainly as\r\nyou want me now Melanctha." "Now Jeff you know I certainly can\'t be\r\nneglecting always to be with everybody just to see you. You come see\r\nme next week Tuesday Jeff, you hear me. I don\'t think Jeff I certainly\r\nbe so busy, Tuesday." Jeff Campbell would then go away and leave her,\r\nand he would be hurt and very angry, for it was hard for a man with a\r\ngreat pride in himself, like Jeff Campbell, to feel himself no better\r\nthan a beggar. And yet he always came as she said he should, on the\r\nday she had fixed for him, and always Jeff Campbell was not sure\r\nyet that he really understood what it was Melanctha wanted. Always\r\nMelanctha said to him, yes she loved him, sure he knew that. Always\r\nMelanctha said to him, she certainly did love him just the same as\r\nalways, only sure he knew now she certainly did seem to be right busy\r\nwith all she certainly now had to be doing.\r\n\r\nJeff never knew what Melanctha had to do now, that made her always\r\nbe so busy, but Jeff Campbell never cared to ask Melanctha such a\r\nquestion. Besides Jeff knew Melanctha Herbert would never, in such a\r\nmatter, give him any kind of a real answer. Jeff did not know whether\r\nit was that Melanctha did not know how to give a simple answer. And\r\nthen how could he, Jeff, know what was important to her. Jeff Campbell\r\nalways felt strongly in him, he had no right to interfere with\r\nMelanctha in any practical kind of a matter. There they had always,\r\nnever asked each other any kind of question. There they had felt\r\nalways in each other, not any right to take care of one another. And\r\nJeff Campbell now felt less than he had ever, any right to claim to\r\nknow what Melanctha thought it right that she should do in any of her\r\nways of living. All Jeff felt a right in himself to question, was her\r\nloving.\r\n\r\nJeff learned every day now, more and more, how much it was that he\r\ncould really suffer. Sometimes it hurt so in him, when he was alone,\r\nit would force some slow tears from him. But every day, now that Jeff\r\nCampbell, knew more how it could hurt him, he lost his feeling of deep\r\nawe that he once always had had for Melanctha\'s feeling. Suffering was\r\nnot so much after all, thought Jeff Campbell, if even he could feel it\r\nso it hurt him. It hurt him bad, just the way he knew he once had hurt\r\nMelanctha, and yet he too could have it and not make any kind of a\r\nloud holler with it.\r\n\r\nIn tender hearted natures, those that mostly never feel strong\r\npassion, suffering often comes to make them harder. When these do not\r\nknow in themselves what it is to suffer, suffering is then very awful\r\nto them and they badly want to help everyone who ever has to suffer,\r\nand they have a deep reverence for anybody who knows really how to\r\nalways surfer. But when it comes to them to really suffer, they soon\r\nbegin to lose their fear and tenderness and wonder. Why it isn\'t so\r\nvery much to suffer, when even I can bear to do it. It isn\'t very\r\npleasant to be having all the time, to stand it, but they are not so\r\nmuch wiser after all, all the others just because they know too how to\r\nbear it.\r\n\r\nPassionate natures who have always made themselves, to suffer, that is\r\nall the kind of people who have emotions that come to them as sharp as\r\na sensation, they always get more tender-hearted when they suffer, and\r\nit always does them good to suffer. Tender-hearted, unpassionate, and\r\ncomfortable natures always get much harder when they suffer, for\r\nso they lose the fear and reverence and wonder they once had for\r\neverybody who ever has to suffer, for now they know themselves what it\r\nis to suffer and it is not so awful any longer to them when they know\r\ntoo, just as well as all the others, how to have it.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came in these days to Jeff Campbell. Jeff knew now always,\r\nway inside him, what it is to really suffer, and now every day with\r\nit, he knew how to understand Melanctha better. Jeff Campbell still\r\nloved Melanctha Herbert and he still had a real trust in her and\r\nhe still had a little hope that some day they would once more get\r\ntogether, but slowly, every day, this hope in him would keep growing\r\nalways weaker. They still were a good deal of time together, but now\r\nthey never any more were really trusting with each other. In the days\r\nwhen they used to be together, Jeff had felt he did not know much what\r\nwas inside Melanctha, but he knew very well, how very deep always was\r\nhis trust in her; now he knew Melanctha Herbert better, but now he\r\nnever felt a deep trust in her. Now Jeff never could be really honest\r\nwith her. He never doubted yet, that she was steady only to him, but\r\nsomehow he could not believe much really in Melanctha\'s loving.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert was a little angry now when Jeff asked her, "I never\r\ngive nobody before Jeff, ever more than one chance with me, and I\r\ncertainly been giving you most a hundred Jeff, you hear me." "And why\r\nshouldn\'t you Melanctha, give me a million, if you really love me!"\r\nJeff flashed out very angry. "I certainly don\'t know as you deserve\r\nthat anyways from me, Jeff Campbell." "It ain\'t deserving, I am ever\r\ntalking about to you Melanctha. Its loving, and if you are really\r\nloving to me you won\'t certainly never any ways call them chances."\r\n"Deed Jeff, you certainly are getting awful wise Jeff now, ain\'t you,\r\nto me." "No I ain\'t Melanctha, and I ain\'t jealous either to you. I\r\njust am doubting from the way you are always acting to me." "Oh yes\r\nJeff, that\'s what they all say, the same way, when they certainly got\r\njealousy all through them. You ain\'t got no cause to be jealous with\r\nme Jeff, and I am awful tired of all this talking now, you hear me."\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell never asked Melanctha any more if she loved him. Now\r\nthings were always getting worse between them. Now Jeff was always\r\nvery silent with Melanctha. Now Jeff never wanted to be honest to her,\r\nand now Jeff never had much to say to her.\r\n\r\nNow when they were together, it was Melanctha always did most of the\r\ntalking. Now she often had other girls there with her. Melanctha was\r\nalways kind to Jeff Campbell but she never seemed to need to be alone\r\nnow with him. She always treated Jeff, like her best friend, and she\r\nalways spoke so to him and yet she never seemed now to very often want\r\nto see him.\r\n\r\nEvery day it was getting harder for Jeff Campbell. It was as if now,\r\nwhen he had learned to really love Melanctha, she did not need any\r\nmore to have him. Jeff began to know this very well inside him.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell did not know yet that Melanctha had begun again to\r\nwander. Jeff was not very quick to suspect Melanctha. All Jeff knew\r\nwas, that he did not trust her to be now really loving to him.\r\n\r\nJeff was no longer now in any doubt inside him. He knew very well now\r\nhe really loved Melanctha. He knew now very well she was not any more\r\na real religion to him. Jeff Campbell knew very well too now inside\r\nhim, he did not really want Melanctha, now if he could no longer\r\ntrust her, though he loved her hard and really knew now what it was to\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nEvery day Melanctha Herbert was less and less near to him. She always\r\nwas very pleasant in her talk and to be with him, but somehow now it\r\nnever was any comfort to him.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert now always had a lot of friends around her. Jeff\r\nCampbell never wanted to be with them. Now Melanctha began to find\r\nit, she said it often to him, always harder to arrange to be alone now\r\nwith him. Sometimes she would be late for him. Then Jeff always would\r\ntry to be patient in his waiting, for Jeff Campbell knew very well how\r\nto remember, and he knew it was only right that he should now endure\r\nthis from her.\r\n\r\nThen Melanctha began to manage often not to see him, and once she went\r\naway when she had promised to be there to meet him.\r\n\r\nThen Jeff Campbell was really filled up with his anger. Now he knew\r\nhe could never really want her. Now he knew he never any more could\r\nreally trust her.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell never knew why Melanctha had not come to meet him.\r\nJeff had heard a little talking now, about how Melanctha Herbert had\r\ncommenced once more to wander. Jeff Campbell still sometimes saw Jane\r\nHarden, who always needed a doctor to be often there to help her. Jane\r\nHarden always knew very well what happened to Melanctha. Jeff Campbell\r\nnever would talk to Jane Harden anything about Melanctha. Jeff was\r\nalways loyal to Melanctha. Jeff never let Jane Harden say much to him\r\nabout Melanctha, though he never let her know that now he loved her.\r\nBut somehow Jeff did know now about Melanctha, and he knew about some\r\nmen that Melanctha met with Rose Johnson very often.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell would not let himself really doubt Melanctha, but Jeff\r\nbegan to know now very well, he did not want her. Melanctha Herbert\r\ndid not love him ever, Jeff knew it now, the way he once had thought\r\nthat she could feel it. Once she had been greater for him than he had\r\nthought he could ever know how to feel it. Now Jeff had come to where\r\nhe could understand Melanctha Herbert. Jeff was not bitter to her\r\nbecause she could not really love him, he was bitter only that he had\r\nlet himself have a real illusion in him. He was a little bitter too,\r\nthat he had lost now, what he had always felt real in the world, that\r\nhad made it for him always full of beauty, and now he had not got this\r\nnew religion really, and he had lost what he before had to know what\r\nwas good and had real beauty.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell was so angry now in him, because he had begged Melanctha\r\nalways to be honest to him. Jeff could stand it in her not to love\r\nhim, he could not stand it in her not to be honest to him.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell went home from where Melanctha had not met him, and he\r\nwas sore and full of anger in him.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell could not be sure what to do, to make it right inside\r\nhim. Surely he must be strong now and cast this loving from him,\r\nand yet, was he sure he now had real wisdom in him. Was he sure that\r\nMelanctha Herbert never had had a real deep loving for him. Was he\r\nsure Melanctha Herbert never had deserved a reverence from him. Always\r\nnow Jeff had this torment in him, but always now he felt more that\r\nMelanctha never had real greatness for him.\r\n\r\nJeff waited to see if Melanctha would send any word to him. Melanctha\r\nHerbert never sent a line to him.\r\n\r\nAt last Jeff wrote his letter to Melanctha. "Dear Melanctha, I\r\ncertainly do know you ain\'t been any way sick this last week when you\r\nnever met me right the way you promised, and never sent me any word to\r\nsay why you acted a way you certainly never could think was the right\r\nway you should do it to me. Jane Harden said she saw you that day and\r\nyou went out walking with some people you like now to be with. Don\'t\r\nbe misunderstanding me now any more Melanctha. I love you now because\r\nthat\'s my slow way to learn what you been teaching, but I know now\r\nyou certainly never had what seems to me real kind of feeling. I don\'t\r\nlove you Melanctha any more now like a real religion, because now I\r\nknow you are just made like all us others. I know now no man can\r\never really hold you because no man can ever be real to trust in you,\r\nbecause you mean right Melanctha, but you never can remember, and\r\nso you certainly never have got any way to be honest. So please you\r\nunderstand me right now Melanctha, it never is I don\'t know how to\r\nlove you. I do know now how to love you, Melanctha, really. You sure\r\ndo know that, Melanctha, in me. You certainly always can trust me. And\r\nso now Melanctha, I can say to you certainly real honest with you, I\r\nam better than you are in my right kind of feeling. And so Melanctha,\r\nI don\'t never any more want to be a trouble to you. You certainly make\r\nme see things Melanctha, I never any other way could be knowing. You\r\nbeen very good and patient to me, when I was certainly below you in my\r\nright feeling. I certainly never have been near so good and patient\r\nto you every any way Melanctha, I certainly know that Melanctha. But\r\nMelanctha, with me, it certainly is, always to be good together, two\r\npeople certainly must be thinking each one as good as the other, to be\r\nreally loving right Melanctha. And it certainly must never be any kind\r\nof feeling, of one only taking, and one only just giving, Melanctha,\r\nto me. I know you certainly don\'t really ever understand me now\r\nMelanctha, but that\'s no matter. I certainly do know what I am feeling\r\nnow with you real Melanctha. And so good-bye now for good Melanctha. I\r\nsay I can never ever really trust you real Melanctha, that\'s only just\r\ncertainly from your way of not being ever equal in your feeling to\r\nanybody real, Melanctha, and your way never to know right how to\r\nremember. Many ways I really trust you deep Melanctha, and I certainly\r\ndo feel deep all the good sweetness you certainly got real in you\r\nMelanctha. Its only just in your loving me Melanctha. You never can be\r\nequal to me and that way I certainly never can bear any more to have\r\nit. And so now Melanctha, I always be your friend, if you need me, and\r\nnow we never see each other any more to talk to."\r\n\r\nAnd then Jeff Campbell thought and thought, and he could never make\r\nany way for him now, to see it different, and so at last he sent this\r\nletter to Melanctha.\r\n\r\nAnd now surely it was all over in Jeff Campbell. Surely now he never\r\nany more could know Melanctha. And yet, perhaps Melanctha really loved\r\nhim. And then she would know how much it hurt him never any more, any\r\nway, to see her, and perhaps she would write a line to tell him.\r\nBut that was a foolish way for Jeff ever to be thinking. Of course\r\nMelanctha never would write a word to him. It was all over now for\r\nalways, everything between them, and Jeff felt it a real relief to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFor many days now Jeff Campbell only felt it as a relief in him. Jeff\r\nwas all locked up and quiet now inside him. It was all settling down\r\nheavy in him, and these days when it was sinking so deep in him, it\r\nwas only the rest and quiet of not fighting that he could really feel\r\ninside him. Jeff Campbell could not think now, or feel anything else\r\nin him. He had no beauty nor any goodness to see around him. It was a\r\ndull, pleasant kind of quiet he now had inside him. Jeff almost began\r\nto love this dull quiet in him, for it was more nearly being free for\r\nhim than anything he had known in him since Melanctha Herbert first\r\nhad moved him. He did not find it a real rest yet for him, he had\r\nnot really conquered what had been working so long in him, he had not\r\nlearned to see beauty and real goodness yet in what had happened to\r\nhim, but it was rest even if he was sodden now all through him. Jeff\r\nCampbell liked it very well, not to have fighting always going on\r\ninside him.\r\n\r\nAnd so Jeff went on every day, and he was quiet, and he began again to\r\nwatch himself in his working; and he did not see any beauty now around\r\nhim, and it was dull and heavy always now inside him, and yet he was\r\ncontent to have gone so far in keeping steady to what he knew was the\r\nright way for him to come back to, to be regular, and see beauty in\r\nevery kind of quiet way of living, the way he had always wanted it for\r\nhimself and for all the colored people. He knew he had lost the sense\r\nhe once had of joy all through him, but he could work, and perhaps he\r\nwould bring some real belief back into him about the beauty that he\r\ncould not now any more see around him.\r\n\r\nAnd so Jeff Campbell went on with his working, and he staid home every\r\nevening, and he began again with his reading, and he did not do much\r\ntalking, and he did not seem to himself to have any kind of feeling.\r\n\r\nAnd one day Jeff thought perhaps he really was forgetting, one day he\r\nthought he could soon come back and be happy in his old way of regular\r\nand quiet living.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell had never talked to any one of what had been going on\r\ninside him. Jeff Campbell liked to talk and he was honest, but it\r\nnever came out from him, anything he was ever really feeling, it\r\nonly came out from him, what it was that he was always thinking. Jeff\r\nCampbell always was very proud to hide what he was really feeling.\r\nAlways he blushed hot to think things he had been feeling. Only to\r\nMelanctha Herbert, had it ever come to him, to tell what it was that\r\nhe was feeling.\r\n\r\nAnd so Jeff Campbell went on with this dull and sodden, heavy, quiet\r\nalways in him, and he never seemed to be able to have any feeling.\r\nOnly sometimes he shivered hot with shame when he remembered some\r\nthings he once had been feeling. And then one day it all woke up, and\r\nwas sharp in him.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell was just then staying long times with a sick man who\r\nmight soon be dying. One day the sick man was resting. Dr. Campbell\r\nwent to the window to look out a little, while he was waiting. It\r\nwas very early now in the southern springtime. The trees were just\r\nbeginning to get the little zigzag crinkles in them, which the young\r\nbuds always give them. The air was soft and moist and pleasant to\r\nthem. The earth was wet and rich and smelling for them. The birds were\r\nmaking sharp fresh noises all around them. The wind was very gentle\r\nand yet urgent to them. And the buds and the long earthworms, and the\r\nnegroes, and all the kinds of children, were coming out every minute\r\nfarther into the new spring, watery, southern sunshine.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell too began to feel a little his old joy inside him. The\r\nsodden quiet began to break up in him. He leaned far out of the window\r\nto mix it all up with him. His heart went sharp and then it almost\r\nstopped inside him. Was it Melanctha Herbert he had just seen passing\r\nby him? Was it Melanctha, or was it just some other girl, who made him\r\nfeel so bad inside him? Well, it was no matter, Melanctha was there\r\nin the world around him, he did certainly always know that in him.\r\nMelanctha Herbert was always in the same town with him, and he could\r\nnever any more feel her near him. What a fool he was to throw her from\r\nhim. Did he know she did not really love him. Suppose Melanctha was\r\nnow suffering through him. Suppose she really would be glad to see\r\nhim. And did anything else he did, really mean anything now to him?\r\nWhat a fool he was to cast her from him. And yet did Melanctha Herbert\r\nwant him, was she honest to him, had Melanctha ever loved him, and\r\ndid Melanctha now suffer by him? Oh! Oh! Oh! and the bitter water once\r\nmore rose up in him.\r\n\r\nAll that long day, with the warm moist young spring stirring in him,\r\nJeff Campbell worked, and thought, and beat his breast, and wandered,\r\nand spoke aloud, and was silent, and was certain, and then in doubt\r\nand then keen to surely feel, and then all sodden in him; and he\r\nwalked, and he sometimes ran fast to lose himself in his rushing, and\r\nhe bit his nails to pain and bleeding, and he tore his hair so that he\r\ncould be sure he was really feeling, and he never could know what it\r\nwas right, he now should be doing. And then late that night he wrote\r\nit all out to Melanctha Herbert, and he made himself quickly send it\r\nwithout giving himself any time to change it.\r\n\r\n"It has come to me strong to-day Melanctha, perhaps I am wrong the\r\nway I now am thinking. Perhaps you do want me badly to be with you.\r\nPerhaps I have hurt you once again the way I used to. I certainly\r\nMelanctha, if I ever think that really, I certainly do want bad not\r\nto be wrong now ever any more to you. If you do feel the way to-day it\r\ncame to me strong maybe you are feeling, then say so Melanctha to me,\r\nand I come again to see you. If not, don\'t say anything any more ever\r\nto me. I don\'t want ever to be bad to you Melanctha, really. I never\r\nwant ever to be a bother to you. I never can stand it to think I am\r\nwrong; really, thinking you don\'t want me to come to you. Tell me\r\nMelanctha, tell me honest to me, shall I come now any more to see\r\nyou." "Yes" came the answer from Melanctha, "I be home Jeff to-night\r\nto see you."\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell went that evening late to see Melanctha Herbert. As Jeff\r\ncame nearer to her, he doubted that he wanted really to be with her,\r\nhe felt that he did not know what it was he now wanted from her. Jeff\r\nCampbell knew very well now, way inside him, that they could never\r\ntalk their trouble out between them. What was it Jeff wanted now to\r\ntell Melanctha Herbert? What was it that Jeff Campbell now could tell\r\nher? Surely he never now could learn to trust her. Surely Jeff knew\r\nvery well all that Melanctha always had inside her. And yet it was\r\nawful, never any more to see her.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell went in to Melanctha, and he kissed her, and he held\r\nher, and then he went away from her and he stood still and looked at\r\nher. "Well Jeff!" "Yes Melanctha!" "Jeff what was it made you act so\r\nto me?" "You know very well Melanctha, it\'s always I am thinking you\r\ndon\'t love me, and you are acting to me good out of kindness, and then\r\nMelanctha you certainly never did say anything to me why you never\r\ncame to meet me, as you certainly did promise to me you would that day\r\nI never saw you!" "Jeff don\'t you really know for certain, I always\r\nlove you?" "No Melanctha, deed I don\'t know it in me. Deed and certain\r\nsure Melanctha, if I only know that in me, I certainly never would\r\ngive you any bother." "Jeff, I certainly do love you more seems to\r\nme always, you certainly had ought to feel that in you." "Sure\r\nMelanctha?" "Sure Jeff boy, you know that." "But then Melanctha why\r\ndid you act so to me?" "Oh Jeff you certainly been such a bother to\r\nme. I just had to go away that day Jeff, and I certainly didn\'t\r\nmean not to tell you, and then that letter you wrote came to me and\r\nsomething happened to me. I don\'t know right what it was Jeff, I just\r\nkind of fainted, and what could I do Jeff, you said you certainly\r\nnever any more wanted to come and see me!" "And no matter Melanctha,\r\neven if you knew, it was just killing me to act so to you, you never\r\nwould have said nothing to me?" "No of course, how could I Jeff when\r\nyou wrote that way to me. I know how you was feeling Jeff to me, but\r\nI certainly couldn\'t say nothing to you." "Well Melanctha, I certainly\r\nknow I am right proud too in me, but I certainly never could act so to\r\nyou Melanctha, if I ever knew any way at all you ever really loved me.\r\nNo Melanctha darling, you and me certainly don\'t feel much the same\r\nway ever. Any way Melanctha, I certainly do love you true Melanctha."\r\n"And I love you too Jeff, even though you don\'t never certainly seem\r\nto believe me." "No I certainly don\'t any way believe you Melanctha,\r\neven when you say it to me. I don\'t know Melanctha how, but sure I\r\ncertainly do trust you, only I don\'t believe now ever in your really\r\nbeing loving to me. I certainly do know you trust me always Melanctha,\r\nonly somehow it ain\'t ever all right to me. I certainly don\'t know any\r\nway otherwise Melanctha, how I can say it to you." "Well I certainly\r\ncan\'t help you no ways any more Jeff Campbell, though you certainly\r\nsay it right when you say I trust you Jeff now always. You certainly\r\nis the best man Jeff Campbell, I ever can know, to me. I never been\r\nanyways thinking it can be ever different to me." "Well you trust me\r\nthen Melanctha, and I certainly love you Melanctha, and seems like\r\nto me Melanctha, you and me had ought to be a little better than we\r\ncertainly ever are doing now to be together. You certainly do think\r\nthat way, too, Melanctha to me. But may be you do really love me. Tell\r\nme, please, real honest now Melanctha darling, tell me so I really\r\nalways know it in me, do you really truly love me?" "Oh you stupid,\r\nstupid boy, Jeff Campbell. Love you, what do you think makes me\r\nalways to forgive you. If I certainly didn\'t always love you Jeff,\r\nI certainly never would let you be always being all the time such a\r\nbother to me the way you certainly Jeff always are to me. Now don\'t\r\nyou dass ever any more say words like that ever to me. You hear me now\r\nJeff, or I do something real bad sometime, so I really hurt you. Now\r\nJeff you just be good to me. You know Jeff how bad I need it, now you\r\nshould always be good to me!"\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell could not make an answer to Melanctha. What was it he\r\nshould now say to her? What words could help him to make their feeling\r\nany better? Jeff Campbell knew that he had learned to love deeply,\r\nthat, he always knew very well now in him, Melanctha had learned to\r\nbe strong to be always trusting, that he knew too now inside him, but\r\nMelanctha did not really love him, that he felt always too strong for\r\nhim. That fact always was there in him, and it always thrust itself\r\nfirm, between them. And so this talk did not make things really better\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell was never any more a torment to Melanctha, he was only\r\nsilent to her. Jeff often saw Melanctha and he was very friendly with\r\nher and he never any more was a bother to her. Jeff never any more now\r\nhad much chance to be loving with her. Melanctha never was alone now\r\nwhen he saw her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert had just been getting thick in her trouble with Jeff\r\nCampbell, when she went to that church where she first met Rose, who\r\nlater was married regularly to Sam Johnson. Rose was a good-looking,\r\nbetter kind of black girl, and had been brought up quite like their\r\nown child by white folks. Rose was living now with colored people.\r\nRose was staying just then with a colored woman, who had known \'Mis\'\r\nHerbert and her black husband and this girl Melanctha.\r\n\r\nRose soon got to like Melanctha Herbert and Melanctha now always\r\nwanted to be with Rose, whenever she could do it. Melanctha Herbert\r\nalways was doing everything for Rose that she could think of that Rose\r\never wanted. Rose always liked to be with nice people who would do\r\nthings for her. Rose had strong common sense and she was lazy. Rose\r\nliked Melanctha Herbert, she had such kind of fine ways in her. Then,\r\ntoo, Rose had it in her to be sorry for the subtle, sweet-natured,\r\ndocile, intelligent Melanctha Herbert who always was so blue\r\nsometimes, and always had had so much trouble. Then, too, Rose could\r\nscold Melanctha, for Melanctha Herbert never could know how to keep\r\nherself from trouble, and Rose was always strong to keep straight,\r\nwith her simple selfish wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut why did the subtle, intelligent, attractive, half white girl\r\nMelanctha Herbert, with her sweetness and her power and her wisdom,\r\ndemean herself to do for and to flatter and to be scolded, by this\r\nlazy, stupid, ordinary, selfish black girl. This was a queer thing in\r\nMelanctha Herbert.\r\n\r\nAnd so now in these new spring days, it was with Rose that Melanctha\r\nbegan again to wander. Rose always knew very well in herself what was\r\nthe right way to do when you wandered. Rose knew very well, she was\r\nnot just any common kind of black girl, for she had been raised by\r\nwhite folks, and Rose always saw to it that she was engaged to him\r\nwhen she had any one man with whom she ever always wandered. Rose\r\nalways had strong in her the sense for proper conduct. Rose always was\r\ntelling the complex and less sure Melanctha, what was the right way\r\nshe should do when she wandered.\r\n\r\nRose never knew much about Jeff Campbell with Melanctha Herbert. Rose\r\nhad not known about Melanctha Herbert when she had been almost all her\r\ntime with Dr. Campbell.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell did not like Rose when he saw her with Melanctha. Jeff\r\nwould never, when he could help it, meet her. Rose did not think much\r\nabout Dr. Campbell. Melanctha never talked much about him to her. He\r\nwas not important now to be with her.\r\n\r\nRose did not like Melanctha\'s old friend Jane Harden when she saw her.\r\nJane despised Rose for an ordinary, stupid, sullen black girl. Jane\r\ncould not see what Melanctha could find in that black girl, to endure\r\nher. It made Jane sick to see her. But then Melanctha had a good mind,\r\nbut she certainly never did care much to really use it. Jane Harden\r\nnow really never cared any more to see Melanctha, though Melanctha\r\nstill always tried to be good to her. And Rose, she hated that stuck\r\nup, mean speaking, nasty, drunk thing, Jane Harden. Rose did not see\r\nhow Melanctha could bear to ever see her, but Melanctha always was so\r\ngood to everybody, she never would know how to act to people the way\r\nthey deserved that she should do it.\r\n\r\nRose did not know much about Melanctha, and Jeff Campbell and Jane\r\nHarden. All Rose knew about Melanctha was her old life with her mother\r\nand her father. Rose was always glad to be good to poor Melanctha, who\r\nhad had such an awful time with her mother and her father, and now she\r\nwas alone and had nobody who could help her. "He was a awful black man\r\nto you Melanctha, I like to get my hands on him so he certainly could\r\nfeel it. I just would Melanctha, now you hear me."\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this simple faith and simple anger and simple moral way\r\nof doing in Rose, that Melanctha now found such a comfort to her. Rose\r\nwas selfish and was stupid and was lazy, but she was decent and knew\r\nalways what was the right way she should do, and what she wanted, and\r\nshe certainly did admire how bright was her friend Melanctha Herbert,\r\nand she certainly did feel how very much it was she always suffered\r\nand she scolded her to keep her from more trouble, and she never was\r\nangry when she found some of the different ways Melanctha Herbert\r\nsometimes had to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd so always Rose and Melanctha were more and more together, and Jeff\r\nCampbell could now hardly ever any more be alone with Melanctha.\r\n\r\nOnce Jeff had to go away to another town to see a sick man. "When I\r\ncome back Monday Melanctha, I come Monday evening to see you. You be\r\nhome alone once Melanctha to see me." "Sure Jeff, I be glad to see\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nWhen Jeff Campbell came to his house on Monday there was a note\r\nthere from Melanctha. Could Jeff come day after to-morrow, Wednesday?\r\nMelanctha was so sorry she had to go out that evening. She was awful\r\nsorry and she hoped Jeff would not be angry.\r\n\r\nJeff was angry and he swore a little, and then he laughed, and then he\r\nsighed. "Poor Melanctha, she don\'t know any way to be real honest, but\r\nno matter, I sure do love her and I be good if only she will let me."\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell went Wednesday night to see Melanctha. Jeff Campbell\r\ntook her in his arms and kissed her. "I certainly am awful sorry not\r\nto see you Jeff Monday, the way I promised, but I just couldn\'t Jeff,\r\nno way I could fix it." Jeff looked at her and then he laughed a\r\nlittle at her. "You want me to believe that really now Melanctha. All\r\nright I believe it if you want me to Melanctha. I certainly be good to\r\nyou to-night the way you like it. I believe you certainly did want\r\nto see me Melanctha, and there was no way you could fix it." "Oh Jeff\r\ndear," said Melanctha, "I sure was wrong to act so to you. It\'s awful\r\nhard for me ever to say it to you, I have been wrong in my acting to\r\nyou, but I certainly was bad this time Jeff to you. It do certainly\r\ncome hard to me to say it Jeff, but I certainly was wrong to go away\r\nfrom you the way I did it. Only you always certainly been so bad Jeff,\r\nand such a bother to me, and making everything always so hard for me,\r\nand I certainly got some way to do it to make it come back sometimes\r\nto you. You bad boy Jeff, now you hear me, and this certainly is the\r\nfirst time Jeff I ever yet said it to anybody, I ever been wrong,\r\nJeff, you hear me!" "All right Melanctha, I sure do forgive you,\r\ncause it\'s certainly the first time I ever heard you say you ever did\r\nanything wrong the way you shouldn\'t," and Jeff Campbell laughed and\r\nkissed her, and Melanctha laughed and loved him, and they really were\r\nhappy now for a little time together.\r\n\r\nAnd now they were very happy in each other and then they were silent\r\nand then they became a little sadder and then they were very quiet\r\nonce more with each other.\r\n\r\n"Yes I certainly do love you Jeff!" Melanctha said and she was very\r\ndreamy. "Sure, Melanctha." "Yes Jeff sure, but not the way you are now\r\never thinking. I love you more and more seems to me Jeff always, and\r\nI certainly do trust you more and more always to me when I know you. I\r\ndo love you Jeff, sure yes, but not the kind of way of loving you\r\nare ever thinking it now Jeff with me. I ain\'t got certainly no hot\r\npassion any more now in me. You certainly have killed all that kind of\r\nfeeling now Jeff in me. You certainly do know that Jeff, now the way I\r\nam always, when I am loving with you. You certainly do know that Jeff,\r\nand that\'s the way you certainly do like it now in me. You certainly\r\ndon\'t mind now Jeff, to hear me say this to you."\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell was hurt so that it almost killed him. Yes he certainly\r\ndid know now what it was to have real hot love in him, and yet\r\nMelanctha certainly was right, he did not deserve she should ever give\r\nit to him. "All right Melanctha I ain\'t ever kicking. I always will\r\ngive you certainly always everything you want that I got in me. I take\r\nanything you want now to give me. I don\'t say never Melanctha it don\'t\r\nhurt me, but I certainly don\'t say ever Melanctha it ought ever to be\r\nany different to me." And the bitter tears rose up in Jeff Campbell,\r\nand they came and choked his voice to be silent, and he held himself\r\nhard to keep from breaking.\r\n\r\n"Good-night Melanctha," and Jeff was very humble to her. "Goodnight\r\nJeff, I certainly never did mean any way to hurt you. I do love you,\r\nsure Jeff every day more and more, all the time I know you." "I\r\nknow Melanctha, I know, it\'s never nothing to me. You can\'t help it,\r\nanybody ever the way they are feeling. It\'s all right now Melanctha,\r\nyou believe me, good-night now Melanctha, I got now to leave you,\r\ngood-by Melanctha, sure don\'t look so worried to me, sure Melanctha\r\nI come again soon to see you." And then Jeff stumbled down the steps,\r\nand he went away fast to leave her.\r\n\r\nAnd now the pain came hard and harder in Jeff Campbell, and he\r\ngroaned, and it hurt him so, he could not bear it. And the tears came,\r\nand his heart beat, and he was hot and worn and bitter in him.\r\n\r\nNow Jeff knew very well what it was to love Melanctha. Now Jeff\r\nCampbell knew he was really understanding. Now Jeff knew what it was\r\nto be good to Melanctha. Now Jeff was good to her always.\r\n\r\nSlowly Jeff felt it a comfort in him to have it hurt so, and to be\r\ngood to Melanctha always. Now there was no way Melanctha ever had had\r\nto bear things from him, worse than he now had it in him. Now Jeff was\r\nstrong inside him. Now with all the pain there was peace in him. Now\r\nhe knew he was understanding, now he knew he had a hot love in him,\r\nand he was good always to Melanctha Herbert who was the one had made\r\nhim have it. Now he knew he could be good, and not cry out for help\r\nto her to teach him how to bear it. Every day Jeff felt himself more a\r\nstrong man, the way he once had thought was his real self, the way he\r\nknew it. Now Jeff Campbell had real wisdom in him, and it did not make\r\nhim bitter when it hurt him, for Jeff knew now all through him that he\r\nwas really strong to bear it.\r\n\r\nAnd so now Jeff Campbell could see Melanctha often, and he was\r\npatient, and always very friendly to her, and every day Jeff Campbell\r\nunderstood Melanctha Herbert better. And always Jeff saw Melanctha\r\ncould not love him the way he needed she should do it. Melanctha\r\nHerbert had no way she ever really could remember.\r\n\r\nAnd now Jeff knew there was a man Melanctha met very often, and\r\nperhaps she wanted to try to have this man to be good, for her. Jeff\r\nCampbell never saw the man Melanctha Herbert perhaps now wanted. Jeff\r\nCampbell only knew very well that there was one. Then there was Rose\r\nthat Melanctha now always had with her when she wandered.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell was very quiet to Melanctha. He said to her, now he\r\nthought he did not want to come any more especially to see her. When\r\nthey met, he always would be glad to see her, but now he never would\r\ngo anywhere any more to meet her. Sure he knew she always would have\r\na deep love in him for her. Sure she knew that. "Yes Jeff, I always\r\ntrust you Jeff, I certainly do know that all right." Jeff Campbell\r\nsaid, all right he never could say anything to reproach her. She knew\r\nalways that he really had learned all through him how to love her.\r\n"Yes, Jeff, I certainly do know that." She knew now she could always\r\ntrust him. Jeff always would be loyal to her though now she never was\r\nany more to him like a religion, but he never could forget the real\r\nsweetness in her. That Jeff must remember always, though now he never\r\ncan trust her to be really loving to any man for always, she never did\r\nhave any way she ever could remember. If she ever needed anybody to be\r\ngood to her, Jeff Campbell always would do anything he could to help\r\nher. He never can forget the things she taught him so he could be\r\nreally understanding, but he never any more wants to see her. He be\r\nlike a brother to her always, when she needs it, and he always will be\r\na good friend to her. Jeff Campbell certainly was sorry never any\r\nmore to see her, but it was good that they now knew each other really.\r\n"Good-bye Jeff you always been very good always to me." "Good-bye\r\nMelanctha you know you always can trust yourself to me." "Yes, I know,\r\nI know Jeff, really." "I certainly got to go now Melanctha, from you.\r\nI go this time, Melanctha really," and Jeff Campbell went away and\r\nthis time he never looked back to her. This time Jeff Campbell just\r\nbroke away and left her.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell loved to think now he was strong again to be quiet, and\r\nto live regular, and to do everything the way he wanted it to be right\r\nfor himself and all the colored people. Jeff went away for a little\r\nwhile to another town to work there, and he worked hard, and he was\r\nvery sad inside him, and sometimes the tears would rise up in him, and\r\nthen he would work hard, and then he would begin once more to see\r\nsome beauty in the world around him. Jeff had behaved right and he had\r\nlearned to have a real love in him. That was very good to have inside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nJeff Campbell never could forget the sweetness in Melanctha Herbert,\r\nand he was always very friendly to her, but they never any more came\r\nclose to one another. More and more Jeff Campbell and Melanctha fell\r\naway from all knowing of each other, but Jeff never could forget\r\nMelanctha. Jeff never could forget the real sweetness she had in her,\r\nbut Jeff never any more had the sense of a real religion for her. Jeff\r\nalways had strong in him the meaning of all the new kind of beauty\r\nMelanctha Herbert once had shown him, and always more and more it\r\nhelped him with his working for himself and for all the colored\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert, now that she was all through with Jeff Campbell,\r\nwas free to be with Rose and the new men she met now.\r\n\r\nRose was always now with Melanctha Herbert. Rose never found any way\r\nto get excited. Rose always was telling Melanctha Herbert the right\r\nway she should do, so that she would not always be in trouble. But\r\nMelanctha Herbert could not help it, always she would find new ways to\r\nget excited.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was all ready now to find new ways to be in trouble. And\r\nyet Melanctha Herbert never wanted not to do right. Always Melanctha\r\nHerbert wanted peace and quiet, and always she could only find new\r\nways to get excited.\r\n\r\n"Melanctha," Rose would say to her, "Melanctha, I certainly have got\r\nto tell you, you ain\'t right to act so with that kind of feller. You\r\nbetter just had stick to black men now, Melanctha, you hear me what I\r\ntell you, just the way you always see me do it. They\'re real bad men,\r\nnow I tell you Melanctha true, and you better had hear to me. I been\r\nraised by real nice kind of white folks, Melanctha, and I certainly\r\nknows awful well, soon as ever I can see \'em acting, what is a white\r\nman will act decent to you and the kind it ain\'t never no good to a\r\ncolored girl to ever go with. Now you know real Melanctha how I always\r\nmean right good to you, and you ain\'t got no way like me Melanctha,\r\nwhat was raised by white folks, to know right what is the way you\r\nshould be acting with men. I don\'t never want to see you have bad\r\ntrouble come hard to you now Melanctha, and so you just hear to me\r\nnow Melanctha, what I tell you, for I knows it. I don\'t say never\r\ncertainly to you Melanctha, you never had ought to have nothing to\r\ndo ever with no white men, though it ain\'t never to me Melanctha, the\r\nbest kind of a way a colored girl can have to be acting, no I never\r\ndo say to you Melanctha, you hadn\'t never ought to be with white men,\r\nthough it ain\'t never the way I feel it ever real, right for a decent\r\ncolored girl to be always doing, but not never Melanctha, now you hear\r\nme, no not never no kind of white men like you been with always now\r\nMelanctha when I see you. You just hear to me Melanctha, you certainly\r\nhad ought to hear to me Melanctha, I say it just like I knows it awful\r\nwell, Melanctha, and I knows you don\'t know no better, Melanctha, how\r\nto act so, the ways I seen it with them kind of white fellers, them as\r\nnever can know what to do right by a decent girl they have ever got to\r\nbe with them. Now you hear to me Melanctha, what I tell you."\r\n\r\nAnd so it was Melanctha Herbert found new ways to be in trouble.\r\nBut it was not very bad this trouble, for these white men Rose never\r\nwanted she should be with, never meant very much to Melanctha. It was\r\nonly that she liked it to be with them, and they knew all about fine\r\nhorses, and it was just good to Melanctha, now a little, to feel real\r\nreckless with them. But mostly it was Rose and other better kind of\r\ncolored girls and colored men with whom Melanctha Herbert now always\r\nwandered.\r\n\r\nIt was summer now and the colored people came out into the sunshine,\r\nfull blown with the flowers. And they shone in the streets and in the\r\nfields with their warm joy, and they glistened in their black heat,\r\nand they flung themselves free in their wide abandonment of shouting\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nIt was very pleasant in some ways, the life Melanctha Herbert now led\r\nwith Rose and all the others. It was not always that Rose had to scold\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThere was not anybody of all these colored people, excepting only\r\nRose, who ever meant much to Melanctha Herbert. But they all liked\r\nMelanctha, and the men all liked to see her do things, she was so game\r\nalways to do anything anybody ever could do, and then she was good and\r\nsweet to do anything anybody ever wanted from her.\r\n\r\nThese were pleasant days then, in the hot southern negro sunshine,\r\nwith many simple jokes and always wide abandonment of laughter. "Just\r\nlook at that Melanctha there a running. Don\'t she just go like a bird\r\nwhen she is flying. Hey Melanctha there, I come and catch you, hey\r\nMelanctha, I put salt on your tail to catch you," and then the man\r\nwould try to catch her, and he would fall full on the earth and roll\r\nin an agony of wide-mouthed shouting laughter. And this was the kind\r\nof way Rose always liked to have Melanctha do it, to be engaged to\r\nhim, and to have a good warm nigger time with colored men, not to go\r\nabout with that kind of white man, never could know how to act right,\r\nto any decent kind of girl they could ever get to be with them.\r\n\r\nRose, always more and more, liked Melanctha Herbert better. Rose often\r\nhad to scold Melanctha Herbert, but that only made her like Melanctha\r\nbetter. And then Melanctha always listened to her, and always acted\r\nevery way she could to please her. And then Rose was so sorry for\r\nMelanctha, when she was so blue sometimes, and wanted somebody should\r\ncome and kill her.\r\n\r\nAnd Melanctha Herbert clung to Rose in the hope that Rose could\r\nsave her. Melanctha felt the power of Rose\'s selfish, decent kind of\r\nnature. It was so solid, simple, certain to her. Melanctha clung to\r\nRose, she loved to have her scold her, she always wanted to be with\r\nher. She always felt a solid safety in her; Rose always was, in her\r\nway, very good to let Melanctha be loving to her. Melanctha never had\r\nany way she could really be a trouble to her. Melanctha never had any\r\nway that she could ever get real power, to come close inside to her.\r\nMelanctha was always very humble to her. Melanctha was always ready to\r\ndo anything Rose wanted from her. Melanctha needed badly to have\r\nRose always willing to let Melanctha cling to her. Rose was a simple,\r\nsullen, selfish, black girl, but she had a solid power in her. Rose\r\nhad strong the sense of decent conduct, she had strong the sense of\r\ndecent comfort. Rose always knew very well what it was she wanted, and\r\nshe knew very well what was the right way to do to get everything she\r\nwanted, and she never had any kind of trouble to perplex her. And so\r\nthe subtle intelligent attractive half white girl Melanctha Herbert\r\nloved and did for, and demeaned herself in service to this coarse,\r\ndecent, sullen, ordinary, black, childish Rose and now this unmoral\r\npromiscuous shiftless Rose was to be married to a good man of the\r\nnegroes, while Melanctha Herbert with her white blood and attraction\r\nand her desire for a right position was perhaps never to be really\r\nregularly married. Sometimes the thought of how all her world was\r\nmade filled the complex, desiring Melanctha with despair. She wondered\r\noften how she could go on living when she was so blue. Sometimes\r\nMelanctha thought she would just kill herself, for sometimes she\r\nthought this would be really the best thing for her to do.\r\n\r\nRose was now to be married to a decent good man of the negroes. His\r\nname was Sam Johnson, and he worked as a deck-hand on a coasting\r\nsteamer, and he was very steady, and he got good wages.\r\n\r\nRose first met Sam Johnson at church, the same place where she had met\r\nMelanctha Herbert. Rose liked Sam when she saw him, she knew he was a\r\ngood man and worked hard and got good wages, and Rose thought it\r\nwould be very nice and very good now in her position to get really,\r\nregularly married.\r\n\r\nSam Johnson liked Rose very well and he always was ready to do\r\nanything she wanted. Sam was a tall, square shouldered, decent, a\r\nserious, straightforward, simple, kindly, colored workman. They got\r\non very well together, Sam and Rose, when they were married. Rose\r\nwas lazy, but not dirty, and Sam was careful but not fussy. Sam was\r\na kindly, simple, earnest, steady workman, and Rose had good\r\ncommon decent sense in her, of how to live regular, and not to have\r\nexcitements, and to be saving so you could be always sure to have\r\nmoney, so as to have everything you wanted.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long that Rose knew Sam Johnson, before they were\r\nregularly married. Sometimes Sam went into the country with all the\r\nother young church people, and then he would be a great deal with Rose\r\nand with her Melanctha Herbert. Sam did not care much about Melanctha\r\nHerbert. He liked Rose\'s ways of doing, always better. Melanctha\'s\r\nmystery had no charm for Sam ever. Sam wanted a nice little house to\r\ncome to when he was tired from his working, and a little baby all his\r\nown he could be good to. Sam Johnson was ready to marry as soon as\r\never Rose wanted he should do it. And so Sam Johnson and Rose one\r\nday had a grand real wedding and were married. Then they furnished\r\ncompletely, a little red brick house and then Sam went back to his\r\nwork as deck hand on a coasting steamer.\r\n\r\nRose had often talked to Sam about how good Melanctha was and how much\r\nshe always suffered. Sam Johnson never really cared about Melanctha\r\nHerbert, but he always did almost everything Rose ever wanted, and\r\nhe was a gentle, kindly creature, and so he was very good to Rose\'s\r\nfriend Melanctha. Melanctha Herbert knew very well Sam did not like\r\nher, and so she was very quiet, and always let Rose do the talking for\r\nher. She only was very good to always help Rose, and to do anything\r\nshe ever wanted from her, and to be very good and listen and be quiet\r\nwhenever Sam had anything to say to her. Melanctha liked Sam Johnson,\r\nand all her life Melanctha loved and wanted good and kind and\r\nconsiderate people, and always Melanctha loved and wanted people to be\r\ngentle to her, and always she wanted to be regular, and to have peace\r\nand quiet in her, and always Melanctha could only find new ways to be\r\nin trouble. And Melanctha needed badly to have Rose, to believe her,\r\nand to let her cling to her. Rose was the only steady thing Melanctha\r\nhad to cling to and so Melanctha demeaned herself to be like a\r\nservant, to wait on, and always to be scolded, by this ordinary,\r\nsullen, black, stupid, childish woman.\r\n\r\nRose was always telling Sam he must be good to poor Melanctha. "You\r\nknow Sam," Rose said very often to him, "You certainly had ought to be\r\nvery good to poor Melanctha, she always do have so much trouble with\r\nher. You know Sam how I told you she had such a bad time always with\r\nthat father, and he was awful mean to her always that awful black man,\r\nand he never took no kind of care ever to her, and he never helped her\r\nwhen her mother died so hard, that poor Melanctha. Melanctha\'s ma you\r\nknow Sam, always was just real religious. One day Melanctha was real\r\nlittle, and she heard her ma say to her pa, it was awful sad to her,\r\nMelanctha had not been the one the Lord had took from them stead of\r\nthe little brother who was dead in the house there from fever. That\r\nhurt Melanctha awful when she heard her ma say it. She never could\r\nfeel it right, and I don\'t no ways blame Melanctha, Sam, for not\r\nfeeling better to her ma always after, though Melanctha, just like\r\nalways she is, always was real good to her ma after, when she was so\r\nsick, and died so hard, and nobody never to help Melanctha do it, and\r\nshe just all alone to do everything without no help come to her no\r\nway, and that ugly awful black man she have for a father never all the\r\ntime come near her. But that\'s always the way Melanctha is just doing\r\nSam, the way I been telling to you. She always is being just so good\r\nto everybody and nobody ever there to thank her for it. I never did\r\nsee nobody ever Sam, have such bad luck, seems to me always with them,\r\nlike that poor Melanctha always has it, and she always so good with\r\nit, and never no murmur in her, and never no complaining from her, and\r\njust never saying nothing with it. You be real good to her Sam, now\r\nyou hear me, now you and me is married right together. He certainly\r\nwas an awful black man to her Sam, that father she had, acting always\r\njust like a brute to her and she so game and never to tell anybody how\r\nit hurt her. And she so sweet and good always to do anything anybody\r\never can be wanting. I don\'t see Sam how some men can be to act so\r\nawful. I told you Sam, how once Melanctha broke her arm bad and she\r\nwas so sick and it hurt her awful and he never would let no doctor\r\ncome near to her and he do some things so awful to her, she don\'t\r\nnever want to tell nobody how bad he hurt her. That\'s just the way Sam\r\nwith Melanctha always, you never can know how bad it is, it hurts\r\nher. You hear me Sam, you always be real good to her now you and me is\r\nmarried right to each other."\r\n\r\nAnd so Rose and Sam Johnson were regularly married, and Rose sat at\r\nhome and bragged to all her friends how nice it was to be married\r\nreally to a husband.\r\n\r\nRose did not have Melanctha to live with her, now Rose was married.\r\nMelanctha was with Rose almost as much as ever but it was a little\r\ndifferent now their being together.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson never asked Melanctha to live with her in the house, now\r\nRose was married. Rose liked to have Melanctha come all the time to\r\nhelp her, Rose liked Melanctha to be almost always with her, but Rose\r\nwas shrewd in her simple selfish nature, she did not ever think to ask\r\nMelanctha to live with her.\r\n\r\nRose was hard headed, she was decent, and she always knew what it was\r\nshe needed. Rose needed Melanctha to be with her, she liked to have\r\nher help her, the quick, good Melanctha to do for the slow, lazy,\r\nselfish, black girl, but Rose could have Melanctha to do for her and\r\nshe did not need her to live with her.\r\n\r\nSam never asked Rose why she did not have her. Sam always took what\r\nRose wanted should be done for Melanctha, as the right way he should\r\nact toward her.\r\n\r\nIt could never come to Melanctha to ask Rose to let her. It never\r\ncould come to Melanctha to think that Rose would ask her. It would\r\nnever ever come to Melanctha to want it, if Rose should ask her, but\r\nMelanctha would have done it for the safety she always felt when she\r\nwas near her. Melanctha Herbert wanted badly to be safe now, but this\r\nliving with her, that, Rose would never give her. Rose had strong\r\nthe sense for decent comfort, Rose had strong the sense for proper\r\nconduct, Rose had strong the sense to get straight always what she\r\nwanted, and she always knew what was the best thing she needed, and\r\nalways Rose got what she wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd so Rose had Melanctha Herbert always there to help her, and she\r\nsat and was lazy and she bragged and she complained a little and she\r\ntold Melanctha how she ought to do, to get good what she wanted like\r\nshe Rose always did it, and always Melanctha was doing everything Rose\r\never needed. "Don\'t you bother so, doing that Melanctha, I do it or\r\nSam when he comes home to help me. Sure you don\'t mind lifting it\r\nMelanctha? You is very good Melanctha to do it, and when you go out\r\nMelanctha, you stop and get some rice to bring me to-morrow when you\r\ncome in. Sure you won\'t forget Melanctha. I never see anybody like\r\nyou Melanctha to always do things so nice for me." And then Melanctha\r\nwould do some more for Rose, and then very late Melanctha would go\r\nhome to the colored woman where she lived now.\r\n\r\nAnd so though Melanctha still was so much with Rose Johnson, she had\r\ntimes when she could not stay there. Melanctha now could not really\r\ncling there. Rose had Sam, and Melanctha more and more lost the hold\r\nshe had had there.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert began to feel she must begin again to look and see\r\nif she could find what it was she had always wanted. Now Rose Johnson\r\ncould no longer help her.\r\n\r\nAnd so Melanctha Herbert began once more to wander and with men Rose\r\nnever thought it was right she should be with.\r\n\r\nOne day Melanctha had been very busy with the different kinds of ways\r\nshe wandered. It was a pleasant late afternoon at the end of a long\r\nsummer. Melanctha was walking along, and she was free and excited.\r\nMelanctha had just parted from a white man and she had a bunch of\r\nflowers he had left with her. A young buck, a mulatto, passed by and\r\nsnatched them from her. "It certainly is real sweet in you sister, to\r\nbe giving me them pretty flowers," he said to her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see no way it can make them sweeter to have with you," said\r\nMelanctha. "What one man gives, another man had certainly just as much\r\ngood right to be taking." "Keep your old flowers then, I certainly\r\ndon\'t never want to have them." Melanctha Herbert laughed at him and\r\ntook them. "No, I didn\'t nohow think you really did want to have them.\r\nThank you kindly mister, for them. I certainly always do admire to see\r\na man always so kind of real polite to people." The man laughed, "You\r\nain\'t nobody\'s fool I can say for you, but you certainly are a damned\r\npretty kind of girl, now I look at you. Want men to be polite to you?\r\nAll right, I can love you, that\'s real polite now, want to see me try\r\nit." "I certainly ain\'t got no time this evening just only left to\r\nthank you. I certainly got to be real busy now, but I certainly\r\nalways will admire to see you." The man tried to catch and stop her,\r\nMelanctha Herbert laughed and dodged so that he could not touch her.\r\nMelanctha went quickly down a side street near her and so the man for\r\nthat time lost her.\r\n\r\nFor some days Melanctha did not see any more of her mulatto. One day\r\nMelanctha was with a white man and they saw him. The white man stopped\r\nto speak to him. Afterwards Melanctha left the white man and she then\r\nsoon met him. Melanctha stopped to talk to him. Melanctha Herbert soon\r\nbegan to like him.\r\n\r\nJem Richards, the new man Melanctha had begun to know now, was a\r\ndashing kind of fellow, who had to do with fine horses and with\r\nracing. Sometimes Jem Richards would be betting and would be good and\r\nlucky, and be making lots of money. Sometimes Jem would be betting\r\nbadly, and then he would not be having any money.\r\n\r\nJem Richards was a straight man. Jem Richards always knew that by and\r\nby he would win again and pay it, and so Jem mostly did win again, and\r\nthen he always paid it.\r\n\r\nJem Richards was a man other men always trusted. Men gave him money\r\nwhen he lost all his, for they all knew Jem Richards would win again,\r\nand when he did win they knew, and they were right, that he would pay\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert all her life had always loved to be with horses.\r\nMelanctha liked it that Jem knew all about fine horses. He was a\r\nreckless man was Jem Richards. He knew how to win out, and always all\r\nher life, Melanctha Herbert loved successful power.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert always liked Jem Richards better. Things soon began\r\nto be very strong between them.\r\n\r\nJem was more game even than Melanctha. Jem always had known what\r\nit was to have real wisdom. Jem had always all his life been\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nJem Richards made Melanctha Herbert come fast with him. He never gave\r\nher any time with waiting. Soon Melanctha always had Jem with her.\r\nMelanctha did not want anything better. Now in Jem Richards, Melanctha\r\nfound everything she had ever needed to content her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was now less and less with Rose Johnson. Rose did not think\r\nmuch of the way Melanctha now was going. Jem Richards was all right,\r\nonly Melanctha never had no sense of the right kind of way she should\r\nbe doing. Rose often was telling Sam now, she did not like the fast\r\nway Melanctha was going. Rose told it to Sam, and to all the girls and\r\nmen, when she saw them. But Rose was nothing just then to Melanctha.\r\nMelanctha Herbert now only needed Jem Richards to be with her.\r\n\r\nAnd things were always getting stronger between Jem Richards and\r\nMelanctha Herbert. Jem Richards began to talk now as if he wanted to\r\nget married to her. Jem was deep in his love now for her. And as for\r\nMelanctha, Jem was all the world now to her. And so Jem gave her a\r\nring, like white folks, to show he was engaged to her, and would by\r\nand by be married to her. And Melanctha was filled full with joy to\r\nhave Jem so good to her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha always loved to go with Jem to the races. Jem had been lucky\r\nlately with his betting, and he had a swell turn-out to drive in, and\r\nMelanctha looked very handsome there beside him.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was very proud to have Jem Richards want her. Melanctha\r\nloved it the way Jem knew how to do it. Melanctha loved Jem and\r\nloved that he should want her. She loved it too, that he wanted to be\r\nmarried to her. Jem Richards was a straight decent man, whom other\r\nmen always looked up to and trusted. Melanctha needed badly a man to\r\ncontent her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha\'s joy made her foolish. Melanctha told everybody about how\r\nJem Richards, that swell man who owned all those fine horses and was\r\nso game, nothing ever scared him, was engaged to be married to her,\r\nand that was the ring he gave her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha let out her joy very often to Rose Johnson. Melanctha had\r\nbegun again now to go there.\r\n\r\nMelanctha\'s love for Jem made her foolish. Melanctha had to have some\r\none always now to talk to and so she went often to Rose Johnson.\r\n\r\nMelanctha put all herself into Jem Richards. She was mad and foolish\r\nin the joy she had there.\r\n\r\nRose never liked the way Melanctha did it. "No Sam I don\'t say never\r\nMelanctha ain\'t engaged to Jem Richards the way she always says it,\r\nand Jem he is all right for that kind of man he is, though he do think\r\nhimself so smart and like he owns the earth and everything he can get\r\nwith it, and he sure gave Melanctha a ring like he really meant he\r\nshould be married right soon with it, only Sam, I don\'t ever like it\r\nthe way Melanctha is going. When she is engaged to him Sam, she ain\'t\r\nnot right to take on so excited. That ain\'t no decent kind of a way a\r\ngirl ever should be acting. There ain\'t no kind of a man going stand\r\nthat, not like I knows men Sam, and I sure does know them. I knows\r\nthem white and I knows them colored, for I was raised by white folks,\r\nand they don\'t none of them like a girl to act so. That\'s all right to\r\nbe so when you is just only loving, but it ain\'t no ways right to be\r\nacting so when you is engaged to him, and when he says, all right he\r\nget really regularly married to you. You see Sam I am right like I am\r\nalways and I knows it. Jem Richards, he ain\'t going to the last to get\r\nreal married, not if I knows it right, the way Melanctha now is acting\r\nto him. Rings or anything ain\'t nothing to them, and they don\'t never\r\ndo no good for them, when a girl acts foolish like Melanctha always\r\nnow is acting. I certainly will be right sorry Sam, if Melanctha has\r\nreal bad trouble come now to her, but I certainly don\'t no ways like\r\nit Sam the kind of way Melanctha is acting to him. I don\'t never say\r\nnothing to her Sam. I just listens to what she is saying always, and\r\nI thinks it out like I am telling to you Sam but I don\'t never say\r\nnothing no more now to Melanctha. Melanctha didn\'t say nothing to me\r\nabout that Jem Richards till she was all like finished with him, and\r\nI never did like it Sam, much, the way she was acting, not coming\r\nhere never when she first ran with those men and met him. And I didn\'t\r\nnever say nothing to her, Sam, about it, and it ain\'t nothing ever to\r\nme, only I don\'t never no more want to say nothing to her, so I just\r\nlistens to what she got to tell like she wants it. No Sam, I don\'t\r\nnever want to say nothing to her. Melanctha just got to go her own\r\nway, not as I want to see her have bad trouble ever come hard to her,\r\nonly it ain\'t in me never Sam, after Melanctha did so, ever to say\r\nnothing more to her how she should be acting. You just see Sam like I\r\ntell you, what way Jem Richards will act to her, you see Sam I just am\r\nright like I always am when I knows it."\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert never thought she could ever again be in trouble.\r\nMelanctha\'s joy had made her foolish.\r\n\r\nAnd now Jem Richards had some bad trouble with his betting. Melanctha\r\nsometimes felt now when she was with him that there was something\r\nwrong inside him. Melanctha knew he had had trouble with his betting\r\nbut Melanctha never felt that that could make any difference to them.\r\n\r\nMelanctha once had told Jem, sure he knew she always would love to be\r\nwith him, if he was in jail or only just a beggar. Now Melanctha\r\nsaid to him, "Sure you know Jem that it don\'t never make any kind of\r\ndifference you\'re having any kind of trouble, you just try me Jem and\r\nbe game, don\'t look so worried to me. Jem sure I know you love me like\r\nI love you always, and its all I ever could be wanting Jem to me, just\r\nyour wanting me always to be with you. I get married Jem to you\r\nsoon ever as you can want me, if you once say it Jem to me. It ain\'t\r\nnothing to me ever, anything like having any money Jem, why you look\r\nso worried to me."\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert\'s love had surely made her mad and foolish. She\r\nthrust it always deep into Jem Richards and now that he had trouble\r\nwith his betting, Jem had no way that he ever wanted to be made to\r\nfeel it. Jem Richards never could want to marry any girl while he had\r\ntrouble. That was no way a man like him should do it. Melanctha\'s love\r\nhad made her mad and foolish, she should be silent now and let him do\r\nit. Jem Richards was not a kind of man to want a woman to be strong to\r\nhim, when he was in trouble with his betting. That was not the kind of\r\na time when a man like him needed to have it.\r\n\r\nMelanctha needed so badly to have it, this love which she had always\r\nwanted, she did not know what she should do to save it. Melanctha saw\r\nnow, Jem Richards always had something wrong inside him. Melanctha\r\nsoon dared not ask him. Jem was busy now, he had to sell things and\r\nsee men to raise money. Jem could not meet Melanctha now so often.\r\n\r\nIt was lucky for Melanctha Herbert that Rose Johnson was coming now to\r\nhave her baby. It had always been understood between them, Rose should\r\ncome and stay then in the house where Melanctha lived with an old\r\ncolored woman, so that Rose could have the Doctor from the hospital\r\nnear by to help her, and Melanctha there to take care of her the way\r\nMelanctha always used to do it.\r\n\r\nMelanctha was very good now to Rose Johnson. Melanctha did everything\r\nthat any woman could, she tended Rose, and she was patient,\r\nsubmissive, soothing and untiring, while the sullen, childish,\r\ncowardly, black Rosie grumbled, and fussed, and howled, and made\r\nherself to be an abomination and like a simple beast.\r\n\r\nAll this time Melanctha was always being every now and then with Jem\r\nRichards. Melanctha was beginning to be stronger with Jem Richards.\r\nMelanctha was never so strong and sweet and in her nature as when she\r\nwas deep in trouble, when she was fighting so with all she had, she\r\ncould not do any foolish thing with her nature.\r\n\r\nAlways now Melanctha Herbert came back again to be nearer to Rose\r\nJohnson. Always now Melanctha would tell all about her troubles to\r\nRose Johnson. Rose had begun now a little again to advise her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha always told Rose now about the talks she had with Jem\r\nRichards, talks where they neither of them liked very well what the\r\nother one was saying. Melanctha did not know what it was Jem Richards\r\nwanted. All Melanctha knew was, he did not like it when she wanted to\r\nbe good friends and get really married, and then when Melanctha would\r\nsay, "all right, I never wear your ring no more Jem, we ain\'t not any\r\nmore to meet ever like we ever going to get really regular married,"\r\nthen Jem did not like it either. What was it Jem Richards really\r\nwanted?\r\n\r\nMelanctha stopped wearing Jem\'s ring on her finger. Poor Melanctha,\r\nshe wore it on a string she tied around her neck so that she could\r\nalways feel it, but Melanctha was strong now with Jem Richards, and he\r\nnever saw it. And sometimes Jem seemed to be awful sorry for it, and\r\nsometimes he seemed kind of glad of it. Melanctha never could make out\r\nreally what it was Jem Richards wanted.\r\n\r\nThere was no other woman yet to Jem, that Melanctha knew, and so she\r\nalways trusted that Jem would come back to her, deep in his love, the\r\nway once he had had it and had made all the world like she once had\r\nnever believed anybody could really make it. But Jem Richards was more\r\ngame than Melanctha Herbert. He knew how to fight to win out, better.\r\nMelanctha really had already lost it, in not keeping quiet and waiting\r\nfor Jem to do it.\r\n\r\nJem Richards was not yet having better luck in his betting. He never\r\nbefore had had such a long time without some good coming to him in\r\nhis betting. Sometimes Jem talked as if he wanted to go off on a trip\r\nsomewhere and try some other place for luck with his betting. Jem\r\nRichards never talked as if he wanted to take Melanctha with him.\r\n\r\nAnd so Melanctha sometimes was really trusting, and sometimes she was\r\nall sick inside her with her doubting. What was it Jem really wanted\r\nto do with her? He did not have any other woman, in that Melanctha\r\ncould be really trusting, and when she said no to him, no she never\r\nwould come near him, now he did not want to have her, then Jem would\r\nchange and swear, yes sure he did want her, now and always right here\r\nnear him, but he never now any more said he wanted to be married soon\r\nto her. But then Jem Richards never would marry a girl, he said that\r\nvery often, when he was in this kind of trouble, and now he did not\r\nsee any way he could get out of his trouble. But Melanctha ought to\r\nwear his ring, sure she knew he never had loved any kind of woman like\r\nhe loved her. Melanctha would wear the ring a little while, and then\r\nthey would have some more trouble, and then she would say to him, no\r\nshe certainly never would any more wear anything he gave her, and then\r\nshe would wear it on the string so nobody could see it but she could\r\nalways feel it on her.\r\n\r\nPoor Melanctha, surely her love had made her mad and foolish.\r\n\r\nAnd now Melanctha needed always more and more to be with Rose Johnson,\r\nand Rose had commenced again to advise her, but Rose could not help\r\nher. There was no way now that anybody could advise her. The time when\r\nMelanctha could have changed it with Jem Richards was now all past\r\nfor her. Rose knew it, and Melanctha too, she knew it, and it almost\r\nkilled her to let herself believe it.\r\n\r\nThe only comfort Melanctha ever had now was waiting on Rose till\r\nshe was so tired she could hardly stand it. Always Melanctha did\r\neverything Rose ever wanted. Sam Johnson began now to be very gentle\r\nand a little tender to Melanctha. She was so good to Rose and Sam was\r\nso glad to have her there to help Rose and to do things and to be a\r\ncomfort to her.\r\n\r\nRose had a hard time to bring her baby to its birth and Melanctha did\r\neverything that any woman could.\r\n\r\nThe baby though it was healthy after it was born did not live long.\r\nRose Johnson was careless and negligent and selfish and when Melanctha\r\nhad to leave for a few days the baby died. Rose Johnson had liked her\r\nbaby well enough and perhaps she just forgot it for a while, anyway\r\nthe child was dead and Rose and Sam were very sorry, but then these\r\nthings came so often in the negro world in Bridgepoint that they\r\nneither of them thought about it very long. When Rose had become\r\nstrong again she went back to her house with Sam. And Sam Johnson was\r\nalways now very gentle and kind and good to Melanctha who had been so\r\ngood to Rose in her bad trouble.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert\'s troubles with Jem Richards were never getting any\r\nbetter. Jem always now had less and less time to be with her. When\r\nJem was with Melanctha now he was good enough to her. Jem Richards was\r\nworried with his betting. Never since Jem had first begun to make a\r\nliving had he ever had so much trouble for such a long time together\r\nwith his betting. Jem Richards was good enough now to Melanctha but he\r\nhad not much strength to give her. Melanctha could never any more now\r\nmake him quarrel with her. Melanctha never now could complain of his\r\ntreatment of her, for surely, he said it always by his actions to her,\r\nsurely she must know how a man was when he had trouble on his mind\r\nwith trying to make things go a little better.\r\n\r\nSometimes Jem and Melanctha had long talks when they neither of\r\nthem liked very well what the other one was saying, but mostly now\r\nMelanctha could not make Jem Richards quarrel with her, and more and\r\nmore, Melanctha could not find any way to make it right to blame him\r\nfor the trouble she now always had inside her. Jem was good to her,\r\nand she knew, for he told her, that he had trouble all the time now\r\nwith his betting. Melanctha knew very well that for her it was all\r\nwrong inside Jem Richards, but Melanctha had now no way that she could\r\nreally reach him.\r\n\r\nThings between Melanctha and Jem Richards were now never getting any\r\nbetter. Melanctha now more and more needed to be with Rose Johnson.\r\nRose still liked to have Melanctha come to her house and do things\r\nfor her, and Rose liked to grumble to her and to scold her and to tell\r\nMelanctha what was the way Melanctha always should be doing so\r\nshe could make things come out better and not always be so much in\r\ntrouble. Sam Johnson in these days was always very good and gentle to\r\nMelanctha. Sam was now beginning to be very sorry for her.\r\n\r\nJem Richards never made things any better for Melanctha. Often Jem\r\nwould talk so as to make Melanctha almost certain that he never any\r\nmore wanted to have her. Then Melanctha would get very blue, and she\r\nwould say to Rose, sure she would kill herself, for that certainly now\r\nwas the best way she could do.\r\n\r\nRose Johnson never saw it the least bit that way. "I don\'t see\r\nMelanctha why you should talk like you would kill yourself just\r\nbecause you\'re blue. I\'d never kill myself Melanctha cause I was blue.\r\nI\'d maybe kill somebody else but I\'d never kill myself. If I ever\r\nkilled myself, Melanctha it\'d be by accident and if I ever killed\r\nmyself by accident, Melanctha, I\'d be awful sorry. And that certainly\r\nis the way you should feel it Melanctha, now you hear me, not just\r\ntalking foolish like you always do. It certainly is only your way just\r\nalways being foolish makes you all that trouble to come to you always\r\nnow, Melanctha, and I certainly right well knows that. You certainly\r\nnever can learn no way Melanctha ever with all I certainly been\r\ntelling to you, ever since I know you good, that it ain\'t never no way\r\nlike you do always is the right way you be acting ever and talking,\r\nthe way I certainly always have seen you do so Melanctha always. I\r\ncertainly am right Melanctha about them ways you have to do it, and\r\nI knows it; but you certainly never can noways learn to act right\r\nMelanctha, I certainly do know that, I certainly do my best Melanctha\r\nto help you with it only you certainly never do act right Melanctha,\r\nnot to nobody ever, I can see it. You never act right by me Melanctha\r\nno more than by everybody. I never say nothing to you Melanctha when\r\nyou do so, for I certainly never do like it when I just got to say it\r\nto you, but you just certainly done with that Jem Richards you always\r\nsay wanted real bad to be married to you, just like I always said to\r\nSam you certainly was going to do it. And I certainly am real kind of\r\nsorry like for you Melanctha, but you certainly had ought to have come\r\nto see me to talk to you, when you first was engaged to him so I could\r\nshow you, and now you got all this trouble come to you Melanctha\r\nlike I certainly know you always catch it. It certainly ain\'t never\r\nMelanctha I ain\'t real sorry to see trouble come so hard to you, but\r\nI certainly can see Melanctha it all is always just the way you always\r\nbe having it in you not never to do right. And now you always talk\r\nlike you just kill yourself because you are so blue, that certainly\r\nnever is Melanctha, no kind of a way for any decent kind of a girl to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nRose had begun to be strong now to scold Melanctha and she was\r\nimpatient very often with her, but Rose could now never any more be a\r\nhelp to her. Melanctha Herbert never could know now what it was right\r\nshe should do. Melanctha always wanted to have Jem Richards with her\r\nand now he never seemed to want her, and what could Melanctha do.\r\nSurely she was right now when she said she would just kill herself,\r\nfor that was the only way now she could do.\r\n\r\nSam Johnson always, more and more, was good and gentle to Melanctha.\r\nPoor Melanctha, she was so good and sweet to do anything anybody ever\r\nwanted, and Melanctha always liked it if she could have peace and\r\nquiet, and always she could only find new ways to be in trouble. Sam\r\noften said this now to Rose about Melanctha.\r\n\r\n"I certainly don\'t never want Sam to say bad things about Melanctha,\r\nfor she certainly always do have most awful kind of trouble come hard\r\nto her, but I never can say I like it real right Sam the way Melanctha\r\nalways has to do it. Its now just the same with her like it is always\r\nshe has got to do it, now the way she is with that Jem Richards. He\r\ncertainly now don\'t never want to have her but Melanctha she ain\'t got\r\nno right kind of spirit. No Sam I don\'t never like the way any more\r\nMelanctha is acting to him, and then Sam, she ain\'t never real right\r\nhonest, the way she always should do it. She certainly just don\'t kind\r\nof never Sam tell right what way she is doing with it. I don\'t never\r\nlike to say nothing Sam no more to her about the way she always has\r\nto be acting. She always say, yes all right Rose, I do the way you say\r\nit, and then Sam she don\'t never noways do it. She certainly is right\r\nsweet and good, Sam, is Melanctha, nobody ever can hear me say she\r\nain\'t always ready to do things for everybody anyway she ever can see\r\nto do it, only Sam some ways she never does act real right ever, and\r\nsome ways, Sam, she ain\'t ever real honest with it. And Sam sometimes\r\nI hear awful kind of things she been doing, some girls know about her\r\nhow she does it, and sometimes they tell me what kind of ways she\r\nhas to do it, and Sam it certainly do seem to me like more and more I\r\ncertainly am awful afraid Melanctha never will come to any good.\r\nAnd then Sam, sometimes, you hear it, she always talk like she kill\r\nherself all the time she is so blue, and Sam that certainly never is\r\nno kind of way any decent girl ever had ought to do. You see Sam, how\r\nI am right like I always is when I knows it. You just be careful, Sam,\r\nnow you hear me, you be careful Sam sure, I tell you, Melanctha more\r\nand more I see her I certainly do feel Melanctha no way is really\r\nhonest. You be careful, Sam now, like I tell you, for I knows it, now\r\nyou hear to me, Sam, what I tell you, for I certainly always is right,\r\nSam, when I knows it."\r\n\r\nAt first Sam tried a little to defend Melanctha, and Sam always was\r\ngood and gentle to her, and Sam liked the ways Melanctha had to be\r\nquiet to him, and to always listen as if she was learning, when she\r\nwas there and heard him talking, and then Sam liked the sweet way she\r\nalways did everything so nicely for him; but Sam never liked to fight\r\nwith anybody ever, and surely Rose knew best about Melanctha and\r\nanyway Sam never did really care much about Melanctha. Her mystery\r\nnever had had any interest for him. Sam liked it that she was sweet\r\nto him and that she always did everything Rose ever wanted that she\r\nshould be doing. But Melanctha never would be important to him. All\r\nSam ever wanted was to have a little house and to live regular and to\r\nwork hard and to come home to his dinner, when he was tired with his\r\nworking and by and by he wanted to have some children all his own to\r\nbe good to, and so Sam was real sorry for Melanctha, she was so good\r\nand so sweet always to them, and Jem Richards was a bad man to behave\r\nso to her, but that was always the way a girl got it when she liked\r\nthat kind of fast fellow. Anyhow Melanctha was Rose\'s friend, and Sam\r\nnever cared to have anything to do with the kind of trouble always\r\ncame to women, when they wanted to have men, who never could know how\r\nto behave good and steady to their women.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sam never said much to Rose about Melanctha. Sam was always\r\nvery gentle to her, but now he began less and less to see her. Soon\r\nMelanctha never came any more to the house to see Rose and Sam never\r\nasked Rose anything about her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert was beginning now to come less and less to the house\r\nto be with Rose Johnson. This was because Rose seemed always less and\r\nless now to want her, and Rose would not let Melanctha now do things\r\nfor her. Melanctha was always humble to her and Melanctha always\r\nwanted in every way she could to do things for her. Rose said no,\r\nshe guessed she do that herself like she likes to have it better.\r\nMelanctha is real good to stay so long to help her, but Rose guessed\r\nperhaps Melanctha better go home now, Rose don\'t need nobody to help\r\nher now, she is feeling real strong, not like just after she had all\r\nthat trouble with the baby, and then Sam, when he comes home for his\r\ndinner he likes it when Rose is all alone there just to give him his\r\ndinner. Sam always is so tired now, like he always is in the summer,\r\nso many people always on the steamer, and they make so much work so\r\nSam is real tired now, and he likes just to eat his dinner and never\r\nhave people in the house to be a trouble to him.\r\n\r\nEach day Rose treated Melanctha more and more as if she never wanted\r\nMelanctha any more to come there to the house to see her. Melanctha\r\ndared not ask Rose why she acted in this way to her. Melanctha badly\r\nneeded to have Rose always there to save her. Melanctha wanted badly\r\nto cling to her and Rose had always been so solid for her. Melanctha\r\ndid not dare to ask Rose if she now no longer wanted her to come and\r\nsee her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha now never any more had Sam to be gentle to her. Rose always\r\nsent Melanctha away from her before it was time for Sam to come home\r\nto her. One day Melanctha had stayed a little longer, for Rose\r\nthat day had been good to let Melanctha begin to do things for her.\r\nMelanctha then left her and Melanctha met Sam Johnson who stopped a\r\nminute to speak kindly to her.\r\n\r\nThe next day Rose Johnson would not let Melanctha come in to her. Rose\r\nstood on the steps, and there she told Melanctha what she thought now\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n"I guess Melanctha it certainly ain\'t no ways right for you to come\r\nhere no more just to see me. I certainly don\'t Melanctha no ways like\r\nto be a trouble to you. I certainly think Melanctha I get along better\r\nnow when I don\'t have nobody like you are, always here to help me, and\r\nSam he do so good now with his working, he pay a little girl something\r\nto come every day to help me. I certainly do think Melanctha I don\'t\r\nnever want you no more to come here just to see me." "Why Rose, what\r\nI ever done to you, I certainly don\'t think you is right Rose to be so\r\nbad now to me." "I certainly don\'t no ways Melanctha Herbert think you\r\ngot any right ever to be complaining the way I been acting to you. I\r\ncertainly never do think Melanctha Herbert, you hear me, nobody\r\never been more patient to you than I always been to like you, only\r\nMelanctha, I hear more things now so awful bad about you, everybody\r\nalways is telling to me what kind of a way you always have been doing\r\nso much, and me always so good to you, and you never no ways, knowing\r\nhow to be honest to me. No Melanctha it ain\'t ever in me, not to want\r\nyou to have good luck come to you, and I like it real well Melanctha\r\nwhen you some time learn how to act the way it is decent and right\r\nfor a girl to be doing, but I don\'t no ways ever like it the kind of\r\nthings everybody tell me now about you. No Melanctha, I can\'t never\r\nany more trust you. I certainly am real sorry to have never any more\r\nto see you, but there ain\'t no other way, I ever can be acting to\r\nyou. That\'s all I ever got any more to say to you now Melanctha." "But\r\nRose, deed; I certainly don\'t know, no more than the dead, nothing I\r\never done to make you act so to me. Anybody say anything bad about\r\nme Rose, to you, they just a pack of liars to you, they certainly\r\nis Rose, I tell you true. I certainly never done nothing I ever been\r\nashamed to tell you. Why you act so bad to me Rose. Sam he certainly\r\ndon\'t think ever like you do, and Rose I always do everything I can,\r\nyou ever want me to do for you." "It ain\'t never no use standing there\r\ntalking, Melanctha Herbert. I just can tell it to you, and Sam, he\r\ndon\'t know nothing about women ever the way they can be acting. I\r\ncertainly am very sorry Melanctha, to have to act so now to you, but I\r\ncertainly can\'t do no other way with you, when you do things always so\r\nbad, and everybody is talking so about you. It ain\'t no use to you\r\nto stand there and say it different to me Melanctha. I certainly am\r\nalways right Melanctha Herbert, the way I certainly always have been\r\nwhen I knows it, to you. No Melanctha, it just is, you never can have\r\nno kind of a way to act right, the way a decent girl has to do, and I\r\ndone my best always to be telling it to you Melanctha Herbert, but it\r\ndon\'t never do no good to tell nobody how to act right; they certainly\r\nnever can learn when they ain\'t got no sense right to know it, and you\r\nnever have no sense right Melanctha to be honest, and I ain\'t never\r\nwishing no harm to you ever Melanctha Herbert, only I don\'t never want\r\nany more to see you come here. I just say to you now, like I always\r\nbeen saying to you, you don\'t know never the right way, any kind of\r\ndecent girl has to be acting, and so Melanctha Herbert, me and Sam, we\r\ndon\'t never any more want you to be setting your foot in my house\r\nhere Melanctha Herbert, I just tell you. And so you just go along now,\r\nMelanctha Herbert, you hear me, and I don\'t never wish no harm to come\r\nto you."\r\n\r\nRose Johnson went into her house and closed the door behind her.\r\nMelanctha stood like one dazed, she did not know how to bear this blow\r\nthat almost killed her. Slowly then Melanctha went away without even\r\nturning to look behind her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert was all sore and bruised inside her. Melanctha had\r\nneeded Rose always to believe her, Melanctha needed Rose always to let\r\nher cling to her, Melanctha wanted badly to have somebody who could\r\nmake her always feel a little safe inside her, and now Rose had sent\r\nher from her. Melanctha wanted Rose more than she had ever wanted all\r\nthe others. Rose always was so simple, solid, decent, for her. And now\r\nRose had cast her from her. Melanctha was lost, and all the world went\r\nwhirling in a mad weary dance around her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert never had any strength alone ever to feel safe\r\ninside her. And now Rose Johnson had cast her from her, and Melanctha\r\ncould never any more be near her. Melanctha Herbert knew now, way\r\ninside her, that she was lost, and nothing any more could ever help\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMelanctha went that night to meet Jem Richards who had promised to be\r\nat the old place to meet her. Jem Richards was absent in his manner to\r\nher. By and by he began to talk to her, about the trip he was going\r\nto take soon, to see if he could get some luck back in his betting.\r\nMelanctha trembled, was Jem too now going to leave her. Jem Richards\r\ntalked some more then to her, about the bad luck he always had now,\r\nand how he needed to go away to see if he could make it come out any\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThen Jem stopped, and then he looked straight at Melanctha.\r\n\r\n"Tell me Melanctha right and true, you don\'t care really nothing more\r\nabout me now Melanctha," he said to her.\r\n\r\n"Why you ask me that, Jem Richards," said Melanctha.\r\n\r\n"Why I ask you that Melanctha, God Almighty, because I just don\'t give\r\na damn now for you any more Melanctha. That the reason I was asking."\r\n\r\nMelanctha never could have for this an answer. Jem Richards waited and\r\nthen he went away and left her.\r\n\r\nMelanctha Herbert never again saw Jem Richards. Melanctha never again\r\nsaw Rose Johnson, and it was hard to Melanctha never any more to see\r\nher. Rose Johnson had worked in to be the deepest of all Melanctha\'s\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t never see Melanctha Herbert no more now," Rose would say\r\nto anybody who asked her about Melanctha. "No, Melanctha she never\r\ncomes here no more now, after we had all that trouble with her acting\r\nso bad with them kind of men she liked so much to be with. She don\'t\r\nnever come to no good Melanctha Herbert don\'t, and me and Sam don\'t\r\nwant no more to see her. She didn\'t do right ever the way I told her.\r\nMelanctha just wouldn\'t, and I always said it to her, if she don\'t be\r\nmore kind of careful, the way she always had to be acting, I never\r\ndid want no more she should come here in my house no more to see me. I\r\nain\'t no ways ever against any girl having any kind of a way, to have\r\na good time like she wants it, but not that kind of a way Melanctha\r\nalways had to do it. I expect some day Melanctha kill herself, when\r\nshe act so bad like she do always, and then she got so awful blue.\r\nMelanctha always says that\'s the only way she ever can think it a easy\r\nway for her to do. No, I always am real sorry for Melanctha, she never\r\nwas no just common kind of nigger, but she don\'t never know not with\r\nall the time I always was telling it to her, no she never no way could\r\nlearn, what was the right way she should do. I certainly don\'t never\r\nwant no kind of harm to come bad to Melanctha, but I certainly do\r\nthink she will most kill herself some time, the way she always say it\r\nwould be easy way for her to do. I never see nobody ever could be so\r\nawful blue."\r\n\r\nBut Melanctha Herbert never really killed herself because she was so\r\nblue, though often she thought this would be really the best way for\r\nher to do. Melanctha never killed herself, she only got a bad fever\r\nand went into the hospital where they took good care of her and cured\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhen Melanctha was well again, she took a place and began to work\r\nand to live regular. Then Melanctha got very sick again; she began to\r\ncough and sweat and be so weak she could not stand to do her work.\r\n\r\nMelanctha went back to the hospital, and there the Doctor told her she\r\nhad the consumption, and before long she would surely die. They sent\r\nher where she would be taken care of, a home for poor consumptives,\r\nand there Melanctha stayed until she died.\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENTLE LENA\r\n\r\nLena was patient, gentle, sweet and german. She had been a servant for\r\nfour years and had liked it very well.\r\n\r\nLena had been brought from Germany to Bridgepoint by a cousin and had\r\nbeen in the same place there for four years.\r\n\r\nThis place Lena had found very good. There was a pleasant, unexacting\r\nmistress and her children, and they all liked Lena very well.\r\n\r\nThere was a cook there who scolded Lena a great deal but Lena\'s german\r\npatience held no suffering and the good incessant woman really only\r\nscolded so for Lena\'s good.\r\n\r\nLena\'s german voice when she knocked and called the family in the\r\nmorning was as awakening, as soothing, and as appealing, as a delicate\r\nsoft breeze in midday, summer. She stood in the hallway every morning\r\na long time in her unexpectant and unsuffering german patience calling\r\nto the young ones to get up. She would call and wait a long time and\r\nthen call again, always even, gentle, patient, while the young ones\r\nfell back often into that precious, tense, last bit of sleeping that\r\ngives a strength of joyous vigor in the young, over them that have\r\ncome to the readiness of middle age, in their awakening.\r\n\r\nLena had good hard work all morning, and on the pleasant, sunny\r\nafternoons she was sent out into the park to sit and watch the little\r\ntwo year old girl baby of the family.\r\n\r\nThe other girls, all them that make the pleasant, lazy crowd, that\r\nwatch the children in the sunny afternoons out in the park, all liked\r\nthe simple, gentle, german Lena very well. They all, too, liked very\r\nwell to tease her, for it was so easy to make her mixed and troubled,\r\nand all helpless, for she could never learn to know just what the\r\nother quicker girls meant by the queer things they said.\r\n\r\nThe two or three of these girls, the ones that Lena always sat with,\r\nalways worked together to confuse her. Still it was pleasant, all this\r\nlife for Lena.\r\n\r\nThe little girl fell down sometimes and cried, and then Lena had to\r\nsoothe her. When the little girl would drop her hat, Lena had to pick\r\nit up and hold it. When the little girl was bad and threw away her\r\nplaythings, Lena told her she could not have them and took them from\r\nher to hold until the little girl should need them.\r\n\r\nIt was all a peaceful life for Lena, almost as peaceful as a pleasant\r\nleisure. The other girls, of course, did tease her, but then that only\r\nmade a gentle stir within her.\r\n\r\nLena was a brown and pleasant creature, brown as blonde races\r\noften have them brown, brown, not with the yellow or the red or the\r\nchocolate brown of sun burned countries, but brown with the clear\r\ncolor laid flat on the light toned skin beneath, the plain, spare\r\nbrown that makes it right to have been made with hazel eyes, and not\r\ntoo abundant straight, brown hair, hair that only later deepens itself\r\ninto brown from the straw yellow of a german childhood.\r\n\r\nLena had the flat chest, straight back and forward falling shoulders\r\nof the patient and enduring working woman, though her body was now\r\nstill in its milder girlhood and work had not yet made these lines too\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nThe rarer feeling that there was with Lena, showed in all the even\r\nquiet of her body movements, but in all it was the strongest in the\r\npatient, old-world ignorance, and earth made pureness of her brown,\r\nflat, soft featured face. Lena had eyebrows that were a wondrous\r\nthickness. They were black, and spread, and very cool, with their dark\r\ncolor and their beauty, and beneath them were her hazel eyes, simple\r\nand human, with the earth patience of the working, gentle, german\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nYes it was all a peaceful life for Lena. The other girls, of course,\r\ndid tease her, but then that only made a gentle stir within her.\r\n\r\n"What you got on your finger Lena," Mary, one of the girls she always\r\nsat with, one day asked her. Mary was good natured, quick, intelligent\r\nand Irish.\r\n\r\nLena had just picked up the fancy paper made accordion that the little\r\ngirl had dropped beside her, and was making it squeak sadly as she\r\npulled it with her brown, strong, awkward finger.\r\n\r\n"Why, what is it, Mary, paint?" said Lena, putting her finger to her\r\nmouth to taste the dirt spot.\r\n\r\n"That\'s awful poison Lena, don\'t you know?" said Mary, "that green\r\npaint that you just tasted."\r\n\r\nLena had sucked a good deal of the green paint from her finger. She\r\nstopped and looked hard at the finger. She did not know just how much\r\nMary meant by what she said.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it poison, Nellie, that green paint, that Lena sucked just\r\nnow," said Mary. "Sure it is Lena, its real poison, I ain\'t foolin\'\r\nthis time anyhow."\r\n\r\nLena was a little troubled. She looked hard at her finger where the\r\npaint was, and she wondered if she had really sucked it.\r\n\r\nIt was still a little wet on the edges and she rubbed it off a long\r\ntime on the inside of her dress, and in between she wondered and\r\nlooked at the finger and thought, was it really poison that she had\r\njust tasted.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it too bad, Nellie, Lena should have sucked that," Mary said.\r\n\r\nNellie smiled and did not answer. Nellie was dark and thin, and looked\r\nItalian. She had a big mass of black hair that she wore high up on her\r\nhead, and that made her face look very fine.\r\n\r\nNellie always smiled and did not say much, and then she would look at\r\nLena to perplex her.\r\n\r\nAnd so they all three sat with their little charges in the pleasant\r\nsunshine a long time. And Lena would often look at her finger and\r\nwonder if it was really poison that she had just tasted and then she\r\nwould rub her finger on her dress a little harder.\r\n\r\nMary laughed at her and teased her and Nellie smiled a little and\r\nlooked queerly at her.\r\n\r\nThen it came time, for it was growing cooler, for them to drag\r\ntogether the little ones, who had begun to wander, and to take each\r\none back to its own mother. And Lena never knew for certain whether it\r\nwas really poison, that green stuff that she had tasted.\r\n\r\nDuring these four years of service, Lena always spent her Sundays out\r\nat the house of her aunt, who had brought her four years before to\r\nBridgepoint.\r\n\r\nThis aunt, who had brought Lena, four years before, to Bridgepoint,\r\nwas a hard, ambitious, well meaning, german woman. Her husband was a\r\ngrocer in the town, and they were very well to do. Mrs. Haydon, Lena\'s\r\naunt, had two daughters who were just beginning as young ladies,\r\nand she had a little boy who was not honest and who was very hard to\r\nmanage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon was a short, stout, hard built, german woman. She always\r\nhit the ground very firmly and compactly as she walked. Mrs. Haydon\r\nwas all a compact and well hardened mass, even to her face, reddish\r\nand darkened from its early blonde, with its hearty, shiny cheeks, and\r\ndoubled chin well covered over with the up roll from her short, square\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nThe two daughters, who were fourteen and fifteen, looked like\r\nunkneaded, unformed mounds of flesh beside her.\r\n\r\nThe elder girl, Mathilda, was blonde, and slow, and simple, and quite\r\nfat. The younger, Bertha, who was almost as tall as her sister, was\r\ndark, and quicker, and she was heavy, too, but not really fat.\r\n\r\nThese two girls the mother had brought up very firmly. They were well\r\ntaught for their position. They were always both well dressed, in the\r\nsame kinds of hats and dresses, as is becoming in two german sisters.\r\nThe mother liked to have them dressed in red. Their best clothes were\r\nred dresses, made of good heavy cloth, and strongly trimmed with braid\r\nof a glistening black. They had stiff, red felt hats, trimmed with\r\nblack velvet ribbon, and a bird. The mother dressed matronly, in a\r\nbonnet and in black, always sat between her two big daughters, firm,\r\ndirecting, and repressed.\r\n\r\nThe only weak spot in this good german woman\'s conduct was the way she\r\nspoiled her boy, who was not honest and who was very hard to manage.\r\n\r\nThe father of this family was a decent, quiet, heavy, and\r\nuninterfering german man. He tried to cure the boy of his bad ways,\r\nand make him honest, but the mother could not make herself let the\r\nfather manage, and so the boy was brought up very badly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon\'s girls were now only just beginning as young ladies, and\r\nso to get her niece, Lena, married, was just then the most important\r\nthing that Mrs. Haydon had to do.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon had four years before gone to Germany to see her parents,\r\nand had taken the girls with her. This visit had been for Mrs. Haydon\r\nmost successful, though her children had not liked it very well.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon was a good and generous woman, and she patronized her\r\nparents grandly, and all the cousins who came from all about to see\r\nher. Mrs. Haydon\'s people were of the middling class of farmers. They\r\nwere not peasants, and they lived in a town of some pretension, but\r\nit all seemed very poor and smelly to Mrs. Haydon\'s american born\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon liked it all. It was familiar, and then here she was so\r\nwealthy and important. She listened and decided, and advised all of\r\nher relations how to do things better. She arranged their present and\r\ntheir future for them, and showed them how in the past they had been\r\nwrong in all their methods.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon\'s only trouble was with her two daughters, whom she could\r\nnot make behave well to her parents. The two girls were very nasty to\r\nall their numerous relations. Their mother could hardly make them kiss\r\ntheir grandparents, and every day the girls would get a scolding. But\r\nthen Mrs. Haydon was so very busy that she did not have time to really\r\nmanage her stubborn daughters.\r\n\r\nThese hard working, earth-rough german cousins were to these american\r\nborn children, ugly and dirty, and as far below them as were italian\r\nor negro workmen, and they could not see how their mother could ever\r\nbear to touch them, and then all the women dressed so funny, and were\r\nworked all rough and different.\r\n\r\nThe two girls stuck up their noses at them all, and always talked in\r\nEnglish to each other about how they hated all these people and how\r\nthey wished their mother would not do so. The girls could talk some\r\nGerman, but they never chose to use it.\r\n\r\nIt was her eldest brother\'s family that most interested Mrs. Haydon.\r\nHere there were eight children, and out of the eight, five of them\r\nwere girls.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon thought it would be a fine thing to take one of these\r\ngirls back with her to Bridgepoint and get her well started. Everybody\r\nliked that she should do so and they were all willing that it should\r\nbe Lena.\r\n\r\nLena was the second girl in her large family. She was at this time\r\njust seventeen years old. Lena was not an important daughter in the\r\nfamily. She was always sort of dreamy and not there. She worked hard\r\nand went very regularly at it, but even good work never seemed to\r\nbring her near.\r\n\r\nLena\'s age just suited Mrs. Haydon\'s purpose. Lena could first go\r\nout to service, and learn how to do things, and then, when she was a\r\nlittle older, Mrs. Haydon could get her a good husband. And then Lena\r\nwas so still and docile, she would never want to do things her own\r\nway. And then, too, Mrs. Haydon, with all her hardness had wisdom, and\r\nshe could feel the rarer strain there was in Lena.\r\n\r\nLena was willing to go with Mrs. Haydon. Lena did not like her german\r\nlife very well. It was not the hard work but the roughness that\r\ndisturbed her. The people were not gentle, and the men when they were\r\nglad were very boisterous, and would lay hold of her and roughly tease\r\nher. They were good people enough around her, but it was all harsh and\r\ndreary for her.\r\n\r\nLena did not really know that she did not like it. She did not know\r\nthat she was always dreamy and not there. She did not think whether it\r\nwould be different for her away off there in Bridgepoint. Mrs. Haydon\r\ntook her and got her different kinds of dresses, and then took her\r\nwith them to the steamer. Lena did not really know what it was that\r\nhad happened to her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon, and her daughters, and Lena traveled second class on the\r\nsteamer. Mrs. Haydon\'s daughters hated that their mother should take\r\nLena. They hated to have a cousin, who was to them, little better than\r\na nigger, and then everybody on the steamer there would see her. Mrs.\r\nHaydon\'s daughters said things like this to their mother, but she\r\nnever stopped to hear them, and the girls did not dare to make their\r\nmeaning very clear. And so they could only go on hating Lena hard,\r\ntogether. They could not stop her from going back with them to\r\nBridgepoint.\r\n\r\nLena was very sick on the voyage. She thought, surely before it was\r\nover that she would die. She was so sick she could not even wish that\r\nshe had not started. She could not eat, she could not moan, she was\r\njust blank and scared, and sure that every minute she would die. She\r\ncould not hold herself in, nor help herself in her trouble. She just\r\nstaid where she had been put, pale, and scared, and weak, and sick,\r\nand sure that she was going to die.\r\n\r\nMathilda and Bertha Haydon had no trouble from having Lena for a\r\ncousin on the voyage, until the last day that they were on the ship,\r\nand by that time they had made their friends and could explain.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon went down every day to Lena, gave her things to make her\r\nbetter, held her head when it was needful, and generally was good and\r\ndid her duty by her.\r\n\r\nPoor Lena had no power to be strong in such trouble. She did not know\r\nhow to yield to her sickness nor endure. She lost all her little sense\r\nof being in her suffering. She was so scared, and then at her best,\r\nLena, who was patient, sweet and quiet, had not self-control, nor any\r\nactive courage.\r\n\r\nPoor Lena was so scared and weak, and every minute she was sure that\r\nshe would die.\r\n\r\nAfter Lena was on land again a little while, she forgot all her bad\r\nsuffering. Mrs. Haydon got her the good place, with the pleasant\r\nunexacting mistress, and her children, and Lena began to learn some\r\nEnglish and soon was very happy and content.\r\n\r\nAll her Sundays out Lena spent at Mrs. Haydon\'s house. Lena would have\r\nliked much better to spend her Sundays with the girls she always sat\r\nwith, and who often asked her, and who teased her and made a\r\ngentle stir within her, but it never came to Lena\'s unexpectant and\r\nunsuffering german nature to do something different from what was\r\nexpected of her, just because she would like it that way better. Mrs.\r\nHaydon had said that Lena was to come to her house every other Sunday,\r\nand so Lena always went there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon was the only one of her family who took any interest in\r\nLena. Mr. Haydon did not think much of her. She was his wife\'s cousin\r\nand he was good to her, but she was for him stupid, and a little\r\nsimple, and very dull, and sure some day to need help and to be in\r\ntrouble. All young poor relations, who were brought from Germany to\r\nBridgepoint were sure, before long, to need help and to be in trouble.\r\n\r\nThe little Haydon boy was always very nasty to her. He was a hard\r\nchild for any one to manage, and his mother spoiled him very badly.\r\nMrs. Haydon\'s daughters as they grew older did not learn to like Lena\r\nany better. Lena never knew that she did not like them either. She\r\ndid not know that she was only happy with the other quicker girls, she\r\nalways sat with in the park, and who laughed at her and always teased\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMathilda Haydon, the simple, fat, blonde, older daughter felt very\r\nbadly that she had to say that this was her cousin Lena, this Lena who\r\nwas little better for her than a nigger. Mathilda was an overgrown,\r\nslow, flabby, blonde, stupid, fat girl, just beginning as a woman;\r\nthick in her speech and dull and simple in her mind, and very jealous\r\nof all her family and of other girls, and proud that she could have\r\ngood dresses and new hats and learn music, and hating very badly to\r\nhave a cousin who was a common servant. And then Mathilda remembered\r\nvery strongly that dirty nasty place that Lena came from and that\r\nMathilda had so turned up her nose at, and where she had been made\r\nso angry because her mother scolded her and liked all those rough\r\ncow-smelly people.\r\n\r\nThen, too, Mathilda would get very mad when her mother had Lena at\r\ntheir parties, and when she talked about how good Lena was, to certain\r\ngerman mothers in whose sons, perhaps, Mrs. Haydon might find Lena a\r\ngood husband. All this would make the dull, blonde, fat Mathilda very\r\nangry. Sometimes she would get so angry that she would, in her thick,\r\nslow way, and with jealous anger blazing in her light blue eyes, tell\r\nher mother that she did not see how she could like that nasty Lena;\r\nand then her mother would scold Mathilda, and tell her that she knew\r\nher cousin Lena was poor and Mathilda must be good to poor people.\r\n\r\nMathilda Haydon did not like relations to be poor. She told all her\r\ngirl friends what she thought of Lena, and so the girls would never\r\ntalk to Lena at Mrs. Haydon\'s parties. But Lena in her unsuffering\r\nand unexpectant patience never really knew that she was slighted. When\r\nMathilda was with her girls in the street or in the park and would see\r\nLena, she always turned up her nose and barely nodded to her, and then\r\nshe would tell her friends how funny her mother was to take care of\r\npeople like that Lena, and how, back in Germany, all Lena\'s people\r\nlived just like pigs.\r\n\r\nThe younger daughter, the dark, large, but not fat, Bertha Haydon, who\r\nwas very quick in her mind, and in her ways, and who was the favorite\r\nwith her father, did not like Lena, either. She did not like her\r\nbecause for her Lena was a fool and so stupid, and she would let those\r\nIrish and Italian girls laugh at her and tease her, and everybody\r\nalways made fun of Lena, and Lena never got mad, or even had sense\r\nenough to know that they were all making an awful fool of her.\r\n\r\nBertha Haydon hated people to be fools. Her father, too, thought Lena\r\nwas a fool, and so neither the father nor the daughter ever paid\r\nany attention to Lena, although she came to their house every other\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nLena did not know how all the Haydons felt. She came to her aunt\'s\r\nhouse all her Sunday afternoons that she had out, because Mrs. Haydon\r\nhad told her she must do so. In the same way Lena always saved all of\r\nher wages. She never thought of any way to spend it. The german cook,\r\nthe good woman who always scolded Lena, helped her to put it in the\r\nbank each month, as soon as she got it. Sometimes before it got into\r\nthe bank to be taken care of, somebody would ask Lena for it. The\r\nlittle Haydon boy sometimes asked and would get it, and sometimes some\r\nof the girls, the ones Lena always sat with, needed some more money;\r\nbut the german cook, who always scolded Lena, saw to it that this did\r\nnot happen very often. When it did happen she would scold Lena very\r\nsharply, and for the next few months she would not let Lena touch her\r\nwages, but put it in the bank for her on the same day that Lena got\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo Lena always saved her wages, for she never thought to spend them,\r\nand she always went to her aunt\'s house for her Sundays because she\r\ndid not know that she could do anything different.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon felt more and more every year that she had done right to\r\nbring Lena back with her, for it was all coming out just as she had\r\nexpected. Lena was good and never wanted her own way, she was learning\r\nEnglish, and saving all her wages, and soon Mrs. Haydon would get her\r\na good husband.\r\n\r\nAll these four years Mrs. Haydon was busy looking around among all the\r\ngerman people that she knew for the right man to be Lena\'s husband,\r\nand now at last she was quite decided.\r\n\r\nThe man Mrs. Haydon wanted for Lena was a young german-american\r\ntailor, who worked with his father. He was good and all the family\r\nwere very saving, and Mrs. Haydon was sure that this would be just\r\nright for Lena, and then too, this young tailor always did whatever\r\nhis father and his mother wanted.\r\n\r\nThis old german tailor and his wife, the father and the mother of\r\nHerman Kreder, who was to marry Lena Mainz, were very thrifty, careful\r\npeople. Herman was the only child they had left with them, and he\r\nalways did everything they wanted. Herman was now twenty-eight years\r\nold, but he had never stopped being scolded and directed by his father\r\nand his mother. And now they wanted to see him married.\r\n\r\nHerman Kreder did not care much to get married. He was a gentle soul\r\nand a little fearful. He had a sullen temper, too. He was obedient to\r\nhis father and his mother. He always did his work well. He often went\r\nout on Saturday nights and on Sundays, with other men. He liked it\r\nwith them but he never became really joyous. He liked to be with men\r\nand he hated to have women with them. He was obedient to his mother,\r\nbut he did not care much to get married.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon and the elder Kreders had often talked the marriage over.\r\nThey all three liked it very well. Lena would do anything that Mrs.\r\nHaydon wanted, and Herman was always obedient in everything to his\r\nfather and his mother. Both Lena and Herman were saving and good\r\nworkers and neither of them ever wanted their own way.\r\n\r\nThe elder Kreders, everybody knew, had saved up all their money, and\r\nthey were hard, good german people, and Mrs. Haydon was sure that with\r\nthese people Lena would never be in any trouble. Mr. Haydon would not\r\nsay anything about it. He knew old Kreder had a lot of money and owned\r\nsome good houses, and he did not care what his wife did with that\r\nsimple, stupid Lena, so long as she would be sure never to need help\r\nor to be in trouble.\r\n\r\nLena did not care much to get married. She liked her life very well\r\nwhere she was working. She did not think much about Herman Kreder. She\r\nthought he was a good man and she always found him very quiet. Neither\r\nof them ever spoke much to the other. Lena did not care much just then\r\nabout getting married.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon spoke to Lena about it very often. Lena never answered\r\nanything at all. Mrs. Haydon thought, perhaps Lena did not like Herman\r\nKreder. Mrs. Haydon could not believe that any girl not even Lena,\r\nreally had no feeling about getting married.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon spoke to Lena very often about Herman. Mrs. Haydon\r\nsometimes got very angry with Lena. She was afraid that Lena, for\r\nonce, was going to be stubborn, now when it was all fixed right for\r\nher to be married.\r\n\r\n"Why you stand there so stupid, why don\'t you answer, Lena," said Mrs.\r\nHaydon one Sunday, at the end of a long talking that she was giving\r\nLena about Herman Kreder, and about Lena\'s getting married to him.\r\n\r\n"Yes ma\'am," said Lena, and then Mrs. Haydon was furious with this\r\nstupid Lena. "Why don\'t you answer with some sense, Lena, when I ask\r\nyou if you don\'t like Herman Kreder. You stand there so stupid and\r\ndon\'t answer just like you ain\'t heard a word what I been saying to\r\nyou. I never see anybody like you, Lena. If you going to burst out at\r\nall, why don\'t you burst out sudden instead of standing there so silly\r\nand don\'t answer. And here I am so good to you, and find you a good\r\nhusband so you can have a place to live in all your own. Answer me,\r\nLena, don\'t you like Herman Kreder? He is a fine young fellow, almost\r\ntoo good for you, Lena, when you stand there so stupid and don\'t make\r\nno answer. There ain\'t many poor girls that get the chance you got now\r\nto get married."\r\n\r\n"Why, I do anything you say, Aunt Mathilda. Yes, I like him. He don\'t\r\nsay much to me, but I guess he is a good man, and I do anything you\r\nsay for me to do."\r\n\r\n"Well then Lena, why you stand there so silly all the time and not\r\nanswer when I asked you."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t hear you say you wanted I should say anything to you. I\r\ndidn\'t know you wanted me to say nothing. I do whatever you tell me\r\nit\'s right for me to do. I marry Herman Kreder, if you want me."\r\n\r\nAnd so for Lena Mainz the match was made.\r\n\r\nOld Mrs. Kreder did not discuss the matter with her Herman. She never\r\nthought that she needed to talk such things over with him. She just\r\ntold him about getting married to Lena Mainz who was a good worker and\r\nvery saving and never wanted her own way, and Herman made his usual\r\nlittle grunt in answer to her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kreder and Mrs. Haydon fixed the day and made all the\r\narrangements for the wedding and invited everybody who ought to be\r\nthere to see them married.\r\n\r\nIn three months Lena Mainz and Herman Kreder were to be married.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon attended to Lena\'s getting all the things that she needed.\r\nLena had to help a good deal with the sewing. Lena did not sew very\r\nwell. Mrs. Haydon scolded because Lena did not do it better, but then\r\nshe was very good to Lena, and she hired a girl to come and help her.\r\nLena still stayed on with her pleasant mistress, but she spent all her\r\nevenings and her Sundays with her aunt and all the sewing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon got Lena some nice dresses. Lena liked that very well.\r\nLena liked having new hats even better, and Mrs. Haydon had some made\r\nfor her by a real milliner who made them very pretty.\r\n\r\nLena was nervous these days, but she did not think much about getting\r\nmarried. She did not know really what it was, that, which was always\r\ncoming nearer.\r\n\r\nLena liked the place where she was with the pleasant mistress and the\r\ngood cook, who always scolded, and she liked the girls she always sat\r\nwith. She did not ask if she would like being married any better. She\r\nalways did whatever her aunt said and expected, but she was always\r\nnervous when she saw the Kreders with their Herman. She was excited\r\nand she liked her new hats, and everybody teased her and every day her\r\nmarrying was coming nearer, and yet she did not really know what it\r\nwas, this that was about to happen to her.\r\n\r\nHerman Kreder knew more what it meant to be married and he did not\r\nlike it very well. He did not like to see girls and he did not want\r\nto have to have one always near him. Herman always did everything that\r\nhis father and his mother wanted and now they wanted that he should be\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nHerman had a sullen temper; he was gentle and he never said much. He\r\nliked to go out with other men, but he never wanted that there should\r\nbe any women with them. The men all teased him about getting married.\r\nHerman did not mind the teasing but he did not like very well the\r\ngetting married and having a girl always with him.\r\n\r\nThree days before the wedding day, Herman went away to the country to\r\nbe gone over Sunday. He and Lena were to be married Tuesday afternoon.\r\nWhen the day came Herman had not been seen or heard from.\r\n\r\nThe old Kreder couple had not worried much about it. Herman always did\r\neverything they wanted and he would surely come back in time to get\r\nmarried. But when Monday night came, and there was no Herman, they\r\nwent to Mrs. Haydon to tell her what had happened.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon got very much excited. It was hard enough to work so as\r\nto get everything all ready, and then to have that silly Herman go off\r\nthat way, so no one could tell what was going to happen. Here was Lena\r\nand everything all ready, and now they would have to make the wedding\r\nlater so that they would know that Herman would be sure to be there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon was very much excited, and then she could not say much to\r\nthe old Kreder couple. She did not want to make them angry, for she\r\nwanted very badly now that Lena should be married to their Herman.\r\n\r\nAt last it was decided that the wedding should be put off a week\r\nlonger. Old Mr. Kreder would go to New York to find Herman, for it was\r\nvery likely that Herman had gone there to his married sister.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon sent word around, about waiting until a week from that\r\nTuesday, to everybody that had been invited, and then Tuesday morning\r\nshe sent for Lena to come down to see her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon was very angry with poor Lena when she saw her. She\r\nscolded her hard because she was so foolish, and now Herman had gone\r\noff and nobody could tell where he had gone to, and all because Lena\r\nalways was so dumb and silly. And Mrs. Haydon was just like a mother\r\nto her, and Lena always stood there so stupid and did not answer what\r\nanybody asked her, and Herman was so silly too, and now his father\r\nhad to go and find him. Mrs. Haydon did not think that any old people\r\nshould be good to their children. Their children always were so\r\nthankless, and never paid any attention, and older people were always\r\ndoing things for their good. Did Lena think it gave Mrs. Haydon any\r\npleasure, to work so hard to make Lena happy, and get her a good\r\nhusband, and then Lena was so thankless and never did anything that\r\nanybody wanted. It was a lesson to poor Mrs. Haydon not to do things\r\nany more for anybody. Let everybody take care of themselves and never\r\ncome to her with any troubles; she knew better now than to meddle to\r\nmake other people happy. It just made trouble for her and her husband\r\ndid not like it. He always said she was too good, and nobody ever\r\nthanked her for it, and there Lena was always standing stupid and not\r\nanswering anything anybody wanted. Lena could always talk enough to\r\nthose silly girls she liked so much, and always sat with, but who\r\nnever did anything for her except to take away her money, and here was\r\nher aunt who tried so hard and was so good to her and treated her just\r\nlike one of her own children and Lena stood there, and never made any\r\nanswer and never tried to please her aunt, or to do anything that her\r\naunt wanted. "No, it ain\'t no use your standin\' there and cryin\',\r\nnow, Lena. Its too late now to care about that Herman. You should have\r\ncared some before, and then you wouldn\'t have to stand and cry now,\r\nand be a disappointment to me, and then I get scolded by my husband\r\nfor taking care of everybody, and nobody ever thankful. I am glad you\r\ngot the sense to feel sorry now, Lena, anyway, and I try to do what\r\nI can to help you out in your trouble, only you don\'t deserve to have\r\nanybody take any trouble for you. But perhaps you know better next\r\ntime. You go home now and take care you don\'t spoil your clothes and\r\nthat new hat, you had no business to be wearin\' that this morning, but\r\nyou ain\'t got no sense at all, Lena. I never in my life see anybody be\r\nso stupid."\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon stopped and poor Lena stood there in her hat, all trimmed\r\nwith pretty flowers, and the tears coming out of her eyes, and Lena\r\ndid not know what it was that she had done, only she was not going to\r\nbe married and it was a disgrace for a girl to be left by a man on the\r\nvery day she was to be married.\r\n\r\nLena went home all alone, and cried in the street car.\r\n\r\nPoor Lena cried very hard all alone in the street car. She almost\r\nspoiled her new hat with her hitting it against the window in her\r\ncrying. Then she remembered that she must not do so.\r\n\r\nThe conductor was a kind man and he was very sorry when he saw her\r\ncrying. "Don\'t feel so bad, you get another feller, you are such a\r\nnice girl," he said to make her cheerful. "But Aunt Mathilda said now,\r\nI never get married," poor Lena sobbed out for her answer. "Why you\r\nreally got trouble like that," said the conductor, "I just said that\r\nnow to josh you. I didn\'t ever think you really was left by a feller.\r\nHe must be a stupid feller. But don\'t you worry, he wasn\'t much good\r\nif he could go away and leave you, lookin\' to be such a nice girl. You\r\njust tell all your trouble to me, and I help you." The car was empty\r\nand the conductor sat down beside her to put his arm around her, and\r\nto be a comfort to her. Lena suddenly remembered where she was, and if\r\nshe did things like that her aunt would scold her. She moved away from\r\nthe man into the corner. He laughed, "Don\'t be scared," he said, "I\r\nwasn\'t going to hurt you. But you just keep up your spirit. You are a\r\nreal nice girl, and you\'ll be sure to get a real good husband. Don\'t\r\nyou let nobody fool you. You\'re all right and I don\'t want to scare\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe conductor went back to his platform to help a passenger get on\r\nthe car. All the time Lena stayed in the street car, he would come\r\nin every little while and reassure her, about her not to feel so bad\r\nabout a man who hadn\'t no more sense than to go away and leave her.\r\nShe\'d be sure yet to get a good man, she needn\'t be so worried, he\r\nfrequently assured her.\r\n\r\nHe chatted with the other passenger who had just come in, a very well\r\ndressed old man, and then with another who came in later, a good sort\r\nof a working man, and then another who came in, a nice lady, and he\r\ntold them all about Lena\'s having trouble, and it was too bad there\r\nwere men who treated a poor girl so badly. And everybody in the car\r\nwas sorry for poor Lena and the workman tried to cheer her, and the\r\nold man looked sharply at her, and said she looked like a good girl,\r\nbut she ought to be more careful and not to be so careless, and things\r\nlike that would not happen to her, and the nice lady went and sat\r\nbeside her and Lena liked it, though she shrank away from being near\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSo Lena was feeling a little better when she got off the car, and the\r\nconductor helped her, and he called out to her, "You be sure you keep\r\nup a good heart now. He wasn\'t no good that feller and you were lucky\r\nfor to lose him. You\'ll get a real man yet, one that will be better\r\nfor you. Don\'t you be worried, you\'re a real nice girl as I ever see\r\nin such trouble," and the conductor shook his head and went back into\r\nhis car to talk it over with the other passengers he had there.\r\n\r\nThe german cook, who always scolded Lena, was very angry when she\r\nheard the story. She never did think Mrs. Haydon would do so much for\r\nLena, though she was always talking so grand about what she could\r\ndo for everybody. The good german cook always had been a little\r\ndistrustful of her. People who always thought they were so much never\r\ndid really do things right for anybody. Not that Mrs. Haydon wasn\'t\r\na good woman. Mrs. Haydon was a real, good, german woman, and she\r\ndid really mean to do well by her niece Lena. The cook knew that\r\nvery well, and she had always said so, and she always had liked and\r\nrespected Mrs. Haydon, who always acted very proper to her, and Lena\r\nwas so backward, when there was a man to talk to, Mrs. Haydon did have\r\nhard work when she tried to marry Lena. Mrs. Haydon was a good woman,\r\nonly she did talk sometimes too grand. Perhaps this trouble would\r\nmake her see it wasn\'t always so easy to do, to make everybody do\r\neverything just like she wanted. The cook was very sorry now for Mrs.\r\nHaydon. All this must be such a disappointment, and such a worry to\r\nher, and she really had always been very good to Lena. But Lena had\r\nbetter go and put on her other clothes and stop all that crying. That\r\nwouldn\'t do nothing now to help her, and if Lena would be a good girl,\r\nand just be real patient, her aunt would make it all come out right\r\nyet for her. "I just tell Mrs. Aldrich, Lena, you stay here yet a\r\nlittle longer. You know she is always so good to you, Lena, and I know\r\nshe let you, and I tell her all about that stupid Herman Kreder. I got\r\nno patience, Lena, with anybody who can be so stupid. You just stop\r\nnow with your crying, Lena, and take off them good clothes and put\r\nthem away so you don\'t spoil them when you need them, and you can help\r\nme with the dishes and everything will come off better for you. You\r\nsee if I ain\'t right by what I tell you. You just stop crying now Lena\r\nquick, or else I scold you."\r\n\r\nLena still choked a little and was very miserable inside her but she\r\ndid everything just as the cook told her.\r\n\r\nThe girls Lena always sat with were very sorry to see her look so sad\r\nwith her trouble. Mary the Irish girl sometimes got very angry with\r\nher. Mary was always very hot when she talked to Lena\'s aunt Mathilda,\r\nwho thought she was so grand, and had such stupid, stuck up daughters.\r\nMary wouldn\'t be a fat fool like that ugly tempered Mathilda Haydon,\r\nnot for anything anybody could ever give her. How Lena could keep on\r\ngoing there so much when they all always acted as if she was just dirt\r\nto them, Mary never could see. But Lena never had any sense of how she\r\nshould make people stand round for her, and that was always all the\r\ntrouble with her. And poor Lena, she was so stupid to be sorry for\r\nlosing that gawky fool who didn\'t ever know what he wanted and just\r\nsaid "ja" to his mamma and his papa, like a baby, and was scared to\r\nlook at a girl straight, and then sneaked away the last day like as\r\nif somebody was going to do something to him. Disgrace, Lena talking\r\nabout disgrace! It was a disgrace for a girl to be seen with the likes\r\nof him, let alone to be married to him. But that poor Lena, she never\r\ndid know how to show herself off for what she was really. Disgrace to\r\nhave him go away and leave her. Mary would just like to get a chance\r\nto show him. If Lena wasn\'t worth fifteen like Herman Kreder, Mary\r\nwould just eat her own head all up. It was a good riddance Lena had of\r\nthat Herman Kreder and his stingy, dirty parents, and if Lena didn\'t\r\nstop crying about it,--Mary would just naturally despise her.\r\n\r\nPoor Lena, she knew very well how Mary meant it all, this she was\r\nalways saying to her. But Lena was very miserable inside her. She felt\r\nthe disgrace it was for a decent german girl that a man should go away\r\nand leave her. Lena knew very well that her aunt was right when she\r\nsaid the way Herman had acted to her was a disgrace to everyone that\r\nknew her. Mary and Nellie and the other girls she always sat with were\r\nalways very good to Lena but that did not make her trouble any better.\r\nIt was a disgrace the way Lena had been left, to any decent family,\r\nand that could never be made any different to her.\r\n\r\nAnd so the slow days wore on, and Lena never saw her Aunt Mathilda. At\r\nlast on Sunday she got word by a boy to go and see her aunt Mathilda.\r\nLena\'s heart beat quick for she was very nervous now with all this\r\nthat had happened to her. She went just as quickly as she could to see\r\nher Aunt Mathilda.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon quick, as soon as she saw Lena, began to scold her for\r\nkeeping her aunt waiting so long for her, and for not coming in all\r\nthe week to see her, to see if her aunt should need her, and so her\r\naunt had to send a boy to tell her. But it was easy, even for Lena,\r\nto see that her aunt was not really angry with her. It wasn\'t Lena\'s\r\nfault, went on Mrs. Haydon, that everything was going to happen all\r\nright for her. Mrs. Haydon was very tired taking all this trouble\r\nfor her, and when Lena couldn\'t even take trouble to come and see\r\nher aunt, to see if she needed anything to tell her. But Mrs. Haydon\r\nreally never minded things like that when she could do things for\r\nanybody. She was tired now, all the trouble she had been taking to\r\nmake things right for Lena, but perhaps now Lena heard it she would\r\nlearn a little to be thankful to her. "You get all ready to be married\r\nTuesday, Lena, you hear me," said Mrs. Haydon to her. "You come here\r\nTuesday morning and I have everything all ready for you. You wear your\r\nnew dress I got you, and your hat with all them flowers on it, and\r\nyou be very careful coming you don\'t get your things all dirty, you so\r\ncareless all the time, Lena, and not thinking, and you act sometimes\r\nyou never got no head at all on you. You go home now, and you tell\r\nyour Mrs. Aldrich that you leave her Tuesday. Don\'t you go forgetting\r\nnow, Lena, anything I ever told you what you should do to be careful.\r\nYou be a good girl, now Lena. You get married Tuesday to Herman\r\nKreder." And that was all Lena ever knew of what had happened all this\r\nweek to Herman Kreder. Lena forgot there was anything to know about\r\nit. She was really to be married Tuesday, and her Aunt Mathilda said\r\nshe was a good girl, and now there was no disgrace left upon her.\r\n\r\nLena now fell back into the way she always had of being always dreamy\r\nand not there, the way she always had been, except for the few days\r\nshe was so excited, because she had been left by a man the very day\r\nshe was to have been married. Lena was a little nervous all these last\r\ndays, but she did not think much about what it meant for her to be\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nHerman Kreder was not so content about it. He was quiet and was sullen\r\nand he knew he could not help it. He knew now he just had to let\r\nhimself get married. It was not that Herman did not like Lena Mainz.\r\nShe was as good as any other girl could be for him. She was a little\r\nbetter perhaps than other girls he saw, she was so very quiet, but\r\nHerman did not like to always have to have a girl around him. Herman\r\nhad always done everything that his mother and his father wanted. His\r\nfather had found him in New York, where Herman had gone to be with his\r\nmarried sister.\r\n\r\nHerman\'s father when he had found him coaxed Herman a long time and\r\nwent on whole days with his complaining to him, always troubled but\r\ngentle and quite patient with him, and always he was worrying to\r\nHerman about what was the right way his boy Herman should always do,\r\nalways whatever it was his mother ever wanted from him, and always\r\nHerman never made him any answer.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Kreder kept on saying to him, he did not see how Herman could\r\nthink now, it could be any different. When you make a bargain you just\r\ngot to stick right to it, that was the only way old Mr. Kreder could\r\never see it, and saying you would get married to a girl and she got\r\neverything all ready, that was a bargain just like one you make in\r\nbusiness and Herman he had made it, and now Herman he would just have\r\nto do it, old Mr. Kreder didn\'t see there was any other way a good boy\r\nlike his Herman had, to do it. And then too that Lena Mainz was such\r\na nice girl and Herman hadn\'t ought to really give his father so much\r\ntrouble and make him pay out all that money, to come all the way to\r\nNew York just to find him, and they both lose all that time from their\r\nworking, when all Herman had to do was just to stand up, for an hour,\r\nand then he would be all right married, and it would be all over for\r\nhim, and then everything at home would never be any different to him.\r\n\r\nAnd his father went on; there was his poor mother saying always how\r\nher Herman always did everything before she ever wanted, and now just\r\nbecause he got notions in him, and wanted to show people how he could\r\nbe stubborn, he was making all this trouble for her, and making them\r\npay all that money just to run around and find him. "You got no idea\r\nHerman, how bad mama is feeling about the way you been acting Herman,"\r\nsaid old Mr. Kreder to him. "She says she never can understand how\r\nyou can be so thankless Herman. It hurts her very much you been so\r\nstubborn, and she find you such a nice girl for you, like Lena Mainz\r\nwho is always just so quiet and always saves up all her wages, and she\r\nnever wanting her own way at all like some girls are always all the\r\ntime to have it, and you mama trying so hard, just so you could be\r\ncomfortable Herman to be married, and then you act so stubborn Herman.\r\nYou like all young people Herman, you think only about yourself, and\r\nwhat you are just wanting, and your mama she is thinking only what is\r\ngood for you to have, for you in the future. Do you think your mama\r\nwants to have a girl around to be a bother, for herself, Herman. Its\r\njust for you Herman she is always thinking, and she talks always about\r\nhow happy she will be, when she sees her Herman married to a nice\r\ngirl, and then when she fixed it all up so good for you, so it never\r\nwould be any bother to you, just the way she wanted you should like\r\nit, and you say yes all right, I do it, and then you go away like this\r\nand act stubborn, and make all this trouble everybody to take for you,\r\nand we spend money, and I got to travel all round to find you. You\r\ncome home now with me Herman and get married, and I tell your mama she\r\nbetter not say anything to you about how much it cost me to come all\r\nthe way to look for you--Hey Herman," said his father coaxing, "Hey,\r\nyou come home now and get married. All you got to do Herman is just to\r\nstand up for an hour Herman, and then you don\'t never to have any more\r\nbother to it--Hey Herman!--you come home with me to-morrow and get\r\nmarried. Hey Herman."\r\n\r\nHerman\'s married sister liked her brother Herman, and she had always\r\ntried to help him, when there was anything she knew he wanted. She\r\nliked it that he was so good and always did everything that their\r\nfather and their mother wanted, but still she wished it could be that\r\nhe could have more his own way, if there was anything he ever wanted.\r\n\r\nBut now she thought Herman with his girl was very funny. She wanted\r\nthat Herman should be married. She thought it would do him lots of\r\ngood to get married. She laughed at Herman when she heard the story.\r\nUntil his father came to find him, she did not know why it was Herman\r\nhad come just then to New York to see her. When she heard the story\r\nshe laughed a good deal at her brother Herman and teased him a good\r\ndeal about his running away, because he didn\'t want to have a girl to\r\nbe all the time around him.\r\n\r\nHerman\'s married sister liked her brother Herman, and she did not want\r\nhim not to like to be with women. He was good, her brother Herman, and\r\nit would surely do him good to get married. It would make him stand up\r\nfor himself stronger. Herman\'s sister always laughed at him and always\r\nshe would try to reassure him. "Such a nice man as my brother Herman\r\nacting like as if he was afraid of women. Why the girls all like a man\r\nlike you Herman, if you didn\'t always run away when you saw them. It\r\ndo you good really Herman to get married, and then you got somebody\r\nyou can boss around when you want to. It do you good Herman to get\r\nmarried, you see if you don\'t like it, when you really done it. You\r\ngo along home now with papa, Herman and get married to that Lena. You\r\ndon\'t know how nice you like it Herman when you try once how you can\r\ndo it. You just don\'t be afraid of nothing, Herman. You good enough\r\nfor any girl to marry, Herman. Any girl be glad to have a man like you\r\nto be always with them Herman. You just go along home with papa and\r\ntry it what I say, Herman. Oh you so funny Herman, when you sit there,\r\nand then run away and leave your girl behind you. I know she is crying\r\nlike anything Herman for to lose you. Don\'t be bad to her Herman.\r\nYou go along home with papa now and get married Herman. I\'d be awful\r\nashamed Herman, to really have a brother didn\'t have spirit enough\r\nto get married, when a girl is just dying for to have him. You always\r\nlike me to be with you Herman. I don\'t see why you say you don\'t\r\nwant a girl to be all the time around you. You always been good to me\r\nHerman, and I know you always be good to that Lena, and you soon feel\r\njust like as if she had always been there with you. Don\'t act like as\r\nif you wasn\'t a nice strong man, Herman. Really I laugh at you Herman,\r\nbut you know I like awful well to see you real happy. You go home and\r\nget married to that Lena, Herman. She is a real pretty girl and real\r\nnice and good and quiet and she make my brother Herman very happy. You\r\njust stop your fussing now with Herman, papa. He go with you to-morrow\r\npapa, and you see he like it so much to be married, he make everybody\r\nlaugh just to see him be so happy. Really truly, that\'s the way\r\nit will be with you Herman. You just listen to me what I tell you\r\nHerman." And so his sister laughed at him and reassured him, and his\r\nfather kept on telling what the mother always said about her Herman,\r\nand he coaxed him and Herman never said anything in answer, and his\r\nsister packed his things up and was very cheerful with him, and she\r\nkissed him, and then she laughed and then she kissed him, and his\r\nfather went and bought the tickets for the train, and at last late on\r\nSunday he brought Herman back to Bridgepoint with him.\r\n\r\nIt was always very hard to keep Mrs. Kreder from saying what she\r\nthought, to her Herman, but her daughter had written her a letter, so\r\nas to warn her not to say anything about what he had been doing, to\r\nhim, and her husband came in with Herman and said, "Here we are come\r\nhome mama, Herman and me, and we are very tired it was so crowded\r\ncoming," and then he whispered to her. "You be good to Herman, mama,\r\nhe didn\'t mean to make us so much trouble," and so old Mrs. Kreder,\r\nheld in what she felt was so strong in her to say to her Herman. She\r\njust said very stiffly to him, "I\'m glad to see you come home to-day,\r\nHerman." Then she went to arrange it all with Mrs. Haydon.\r\n\r\nHerman was now again just like he always had been, sullen and very\r\ngood, and very quiet, and always ready to do whatever his mother and\r\nhis father wanted. Tuesday morning came, Herman got his new clothes\r\non and went with his father and his mother to stand up for an hour and\r\nget married. Lena was there in her new dress, and her hat with all\r\nthe pretty flowers, and she was very nervous for now she knew she was\r\nreally very soon to be married. Mrs. Haydon had everything all ready.\r\nEverybody was there just as they should be and very soon Herman Kreder\r\nand Lena Mainz were married.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was really over, they went back to the Kreder house\r\ntogether. They were all now to live together, Lena and Herman and\r\nthe old father and the old mother, in the house where Mr. Kreder had\r\nworked so many years as a tailor, with his son Herman always there to\r\nhelp him.\r\n\r\nIrish Mary had often said to Lena she never did see how Lena could\r\never want to have anything to do with Herman Kreder and his dirty\r\nstingy parents. The old Kreders were to an Irish nature, a stingy,\r\ndirty couple. They had not the free-hearted, thoughtless, fighting,\r\nmud bespattered, ragged, peat-smoked cabin dirt that irish Mary knew\r\nand could forgive and love. Theirs was the german dirt of saving, of\r\nbeing dowdy and loose and foul in your clothes so as to save them and\r\nyourself in washing, having your hair greasy to save it in the soap\r\nand drying, having your clothes dirty, not in freedom, but because so\r\nit was cheaper, keeping the house close and smelly because so it cost\r\nless to get it heated, living so poorly not only so as to save money\r\nbut so they should never even know themselves that they had it,\r\nworking all the time not only because from their nature they just had\r\nto and because it made them money but also that they never could be\r\nput in any way to make them spend their money.\r\n\r\nThis was the place Lena now had for her home and to her it was very\r\ndifferent than it could be for an irish Mary. She too was german and\r\nwas thrifty, though she was always so dreamy and not there. Lena was\r\nalways careful with things and she always saved her money, for that\r\nwas the only way she knew how to do it. She never had taken care of\r\nher own money and she never had thought how to use it.\r\n\r\nLena Mainz had been, before she was Mrs. Herman Kreder, always clean\r\nand decent in her clothes and in her person, but it was not because\r\nshe ever thought about it or really needed so to have it, it was the\r\nway her people did in the german country where she came from, and her\r\nAunt Mathilda and the good german cook who always scolded, had kept\r\nher on and made her, with their scoldings, always more careful to keep\r\nclean and to wash real often. But there was no deep need in all this\r\nfor Lena and so, though Lena did not like the old Kreders, though she\r\nreally did not know that, she did not think about their being stingy\r\ndirty people.\r\n\r\nHerman Kreder was cleaner than the old people, just because it was his\r\nnature to keep cleaner, but he was used to his mother and his father,\r\nand he never thought that they should keep things cleaner. And Herman\r\ntoo always saved all his money, except for that little beer he drank\r\nwhen he went out with other men of an evening the way he always liked\r\nto do it, and he never thought of any other way to spend it. His\r\nfather had always kept all the money for them and he always was doing\r\nbusiness with it. And then too Herman really had no money, for he\r\nalways had worked for his father, and his father had never thought to\r\npay him.\r\n\r\nAnd so they began all four to live in the Kreder house together, and\r\nLena began soon with it to look careless and a little dirty, and to be\r\nmore lifeless with it, and nobody ever noticed much what Lena wanted,\r\nand she never really knew herself what she needed.\r\n\r\nThe only real trouble that came to Lena with their living all four\r\nthere together, was the way old Mrs. Kreder scolded. Lena had always\r\nbeen used to being scolded, but this scolding of old Mrs. Kreder was\r\nvery different from the way she ever before had had to endure it.\r\n\r\nHerman, now he was married to her, really liked Lena very well. He did\r\nnot care very much about her but she never was a bother to him being\r\nthere around him, only when his mother worried and was nasty to them\r\nbecause Lena was so careless, and did not know how to save things\r\nright for them with their eating, and all the other ways with money,\r\nthat the old woman had to save it.\r\n\r\nHerman Kreder had always done everything his mother and his father\r\nwanted but he did not really love his parents very deeply. With Herman\r\nit was always only that he hated to have any struggle. It was all\r\nalways all right with him when he could just go along and do the same\r\nthing over every day with his working, and not to hear things, and not\r\nto have people make him listen to their anger. And now his marriage,\r\nand he just knew it would, was making trouble for him. It made him\r\nhear more what his mother was always saying, with her scolding. He had\r\nto really hear it now because Lena was there, and she was so scared\r\nand dull always when she heard it. Herman knew very well with his\r\nmother, it was all right if one ate very little and worked hard all\r\nday and did not hear her when she scolded, the way Herman always had\r\ndone before they were so foolish about his getting married and having\r\na girl there to be all the time around him, and now he had to help her\r\nso the girl could learn too, not to hear it when his mother scolded,\r\nand not to look so scared, and not to eat much, and always to be sure\r\nto save it.\r\n\r\nHerman really did not know very well what he could do to help Lena\r\nto understand it. He could never answer his mother back to help Lena,\r\nthat never would make things any better for her, and he never could\r\nfeel in himself any way to comfort Lena, to make her strong not to\r\nhear his mother, in all the awful ways she always scolded. It just\r\nworried Herman to have it like that all the time around him. Herman\r\ndid not know much about how a man could make a struggle with a mother,\r\nto do much to keep her quiet, and indeed Herman never knew much how to\r\nmake a struggle against anyone who really wanted to have anything very\r\nbadly. Herman all his life never wanted anything so badly, that he\r\nwould really make a struggle against any one to get it. Herman all his\r\nlife only wanted to live regular and quiet, and not talk much and to\r\ndo the same way every day like every other with his working. And now\r\nhis mother had made him get married to this Lena and now with his\r\nmother making all that scolding, he had all this trouble and this\r\nworry always on him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon did not see Lena now very often. She had not lost her\r\ninterest in her niece Lena, but Lena could not come much to her house\r\nto see her, it would not be right, now Lena was a married woman.\r\nAnd then too Mrs. Haydon had her hands full just then with her two\r\ndaughters, for she was getting them ready to find them good husbands,\r\nand then too her own husband now worried her very often about her\r\nalways spoiling that boy of hers, so he would be sure to turn out no\r\ngood and be a disgrace to a german family, and all because his mother\r\nalways spoiled him. All these things were very worrying now to Mrs.\r\nHaydon, but still she wanted to be good to Lena, though she could not\r\nsee her very often. She only saw her when Mrs. Haydon went to call\r\non Mrs. Kreder or when Mrs. Kreder came to see Mrs. Haydon, and that\r\nnever could be very often. Then too these days Mrs. Haydon could not\r\nscold Lena, Mrs. Kreder was always there with her, and it would not be\r\nright to scold Lena, when Mrs. Kreder was there, who had now the real\r\nright to do it. And so her aunt always said nice things now to Lena,\r\nand though Mrs. Haydon sometimes was a little worried when she saw\r\nLena looking sad and not careful, she did not have time just then to\r\nreally worry much about it.\r\n\r\nLena now never any more saw the girls she always used to sit with. She\r\nhad no way now to see them and it was not in Lena\'s nature to search\r\nout ways to see them, nor did she now ever think much of the days when\r\nshe had been used to see them. They never any of them had come to the\r\nKreder house to see her. Not even Irish Mary had ever thought to come\r\nto see her. Lena had been soon forgotten by them. They had soon passed\r\naway from Lena and now Lena never thought any more that she had ever\r\nknown them.\r\n\r\nThe only one of her old friends who tried to know what Lena liked and\r\nwhat she needed, and who always made Lena come to see her, was the\r\ngood german cook who had always scolded. She now scolded Lena hard for\r\nletting herself go so, and going out when she was looking so untidy.\r\n"I know you going to have a baby Lena, but that\'s no way for you to be\r\nlooking. I am ashamed most to see you come and sit here in my kitchen,\r\nlooking so sloppy and like you never used to Lena. I never see anybody\r\nlike you Lena. Herman is very good to you, you always say so, and he\r\ndon\'t treat you bad even though you don\'t deserve to have anybody good\r\nto you, you so careless all the time, Lena, letting yourself go like\r\nyou never had anybody tell you what was the right way you should know\r\nhow to be looking. No, Lena, I don\'t see no reason you should let\r\nyourself go so and look so untidy Lena, so I am ashamed to see you sit\r\nthere looking so ugly, Lena. No Lena that ain\'t no way ever I see a\r\nwoman make things come out better, letting herself go so every way and\r\ncrying all the time like as if you had real trouble. I never wanted to\r\nsee you marry Herman Kreder, Lena, I knew what you got to stand with\r\nthat old woman always, and that old man, he is so stingy too and he\r\ndon\'t say things out but he ain\'t any better in his heart than his\r\nwife with her bad ways, I know that Lena, I know they don\'t hardly\r\ngive you enough to eat, Lena, I am real sorry for you Lena, you know\r\nthat Lena, but that ain\'t any way to be going round so untidy Lena,\r\neven if you have got all that trouble. You never see me do like that\r\nLena, though sometimes I got a headache so I can\'t see to stand to\r\nbe working hardly, and nothing comes right with all my cooking, but I\r\nalways see Lena, I look decent. That\'s the only way a german girl can\r\nmake things come out right Lena. You hear me what I am saying to you\r\nLena. Now you eat something nice Lena, I got it all ready for you, and\r\nyou wash up and be careful Lena and the baby will come all right to\r\nyou, and then I make your Aunt Mathilda see that you live in a house\r\nsoon all alone with Herman and your baby, and then everything go\r\nbetter for you. You hear me what I say to you Lena. Now don\'t let me\r\never see you come looking like this any more Lena, and you just stop\r\nwith that always crying. You ain\'t got no reason to be sitting there\r\nnow with all that crying, I never see anybody have trouble it did them\r\nany good to do the way you are doing, Lena. You hear me Lena. You go\r\nhome now and you be good the way I tell you Lena, and I see what I can\r\ndo. I make your Aunt Mathilda make old Mrs. Kreder let you be till you\r\nget your baby all right. Now don\'t you be scared and so silly Lena. I\r\ndon\'t like to see you act so Lena when really you got a nice man and\r\nso many things really any girl should be grateful to be having. Now\r\nyou go home Lena to-day and you do the way I say, to you, and I see\r\nwhat I can do to help you."\r\n\r\n"Yes Mrs. Aldrich" said the good german woman to her mistress later,\r\n"Yes Mrs. Aldrich that\'s the way it is with them girls when they want\r\nso to get married. They don\'t know when they got it good Mrs. Aldrich.\r\nThey never know what it is they\'re really wanting when they got it,\r\nMrs. Aldrich. There\'s that poor Lena, she just been here crying and\r\nlooking so careless so I scold her, but that was no good that marrying\r\nfor that poor Lena, Mrs. Aldrich. She do look so pale and sad now Mrs.\r\nAldrich, it just break my heart to see her. She was a good girl was\r\nLena, Mrs. Aldrich, and I never had no trouble with her like I got\r\nwith so many young girls nowadays, Mrs. Aldrich, and I never see any\r\ngirl any better to work right than our Lena, and now she got to stand\r\nit all the time with that old woman Mrs. Kreder. My! Mrs. Aldrich, she\r\nis a bad old woman to her. I never see Mrs. Aldrich how old people can\r\nbe so bad to young girls and not have no kind of patience with them.\r\nIf Lena could only live with her Herman, he ain\'t so bad the way men\r\nare, Mrs. Aldrich, but he is just the way always his mother wants him,\r\nhe ain\'t got no spirit in him, and so I don\'t really see no help for\r\nthat poor Lena. I know her aunt, Mrs. Haydon, meant it all right for\r\nher Mrs. Aldrich, but poor Lena, it would be better for her if her\r\nHerman had stayed there in New York that time he went away to leave\r\nher. I don\'t like it the way Lena is looking now, Mrs. Aldrich. She\r\nlooks like as if she don\'t have no life left in her hardly, Mrs.\r\nAldrich, she just drags around and looks so dirty and after all the\r\npains I always took to teach her and to keep her nice in her ways and\r\nlooking. It don\'t do no good to them, for them girls to get married\r\nMrs. Aldrich, they are much better when they only know it, to stay in\r\na good place when they got it, and keep on regular with their working.\r\nI don\'t like it the way Lena looks now Mrs. Aldrich. I wish I knew\r\nsome way to help that poor Lena, Mrs. Aldrich, but she she is a bad\r\nold woman, that old Mrs. Kreder, Herman\'s mother. I speak to Mrs.\r\nHaydon real soon, Mrs. Aldrich, I see what we can do now to help that\r\npoor Lena."\r\n\r\nThese were really bad days for poor Lena. Herman always was real\r\ngood to her and now he even sometimes tried to stop his mother from\r\nscolding Lena. "She ain\'t well now mama, you let her be now you hear\r\nme. You tell me what it is you want she should be doing, I tell her. I\r\nsee she does it right just the way you want it mama. You let be, I say\r\nnow mama, with that always scolding Lena. You let be, I say now, you\r\nwait till she is feeling better." Herman was getting really strong\r\nto struggle, for he could see that Lena with that baby working hard\r\ninside her, really could not stand it any longer with his mother and\r\nthe awful ways she always scolded.\r\n\r\nIt was a new feeling Herman now had inside him that made him feel he\r\nwas strong to make a struggle. It was new for Herman Kreder really to\r\nbe wanting something, but Herman wanted strongly now to be a father,\r\nand he wanted badly that his baby should be a boy and healthy, Herman\r\nnever had cared really very much about his father and his mother,\r\nthough always, all his life, he had done everything just as they\r\nwanted, and he had never really cared much about his wife, Lena,\r\nthough he always had been very good to her, and had always tried to\r\nkeep his mother off her, with the awful way she always scolded, but to\r\nbe really a father of a little baby, that feeling took hold of Herman\r\nvery deeply. He was almost ready, so as to save his baby from all\r\ntrouble, to really make a strong struggle with his mother and with his\r\nfather, too, if he would not help him to control his mother.\r\n\r\nSometimes Herman even went to Mrs. Haydon to talk all this trouble\r\nover. They decided then together, it was better to wait there all four\r\ntogether for the baby, and Herman could make Mrs. Kreder stop a little\r\nwith her scolding, and then when Lena was a little stronger, Herman\r\nshould have his own house for her, next door to his father, so he\r\ncould always be there to help him in his working, but so they could\r\neat and sleep in a house where the old woman could not control them\r\nand they could not hear her awful scolding.\r\n\r\nAnd so things went on, the same way, a little longer. Poor Lena was\r\nnot feeling any joy to have a baby. She was scared the way she had\r\nbeen when she was so sick on the water. She was scared now every time\r\nwhen anything would hurt her. She was scared and still and lifeless,\r\nand sure that every minute she would die. Lena had no power to be\r\nstrong in this kind of trouble, she could only sit still and be\r\nscared, and dull, and lifeless, and sure that every minute she would\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nBefore very long, Lena had her baby. He was a good, healthy little\r\nboy, the baby. Herman cared very much to have the baby. When Lena was\r\na little stronger he took a house next door to the old couple, so he\r\nand his own family could eat and sleep and do the way they wanted.\r\nThis did not seem to make much change now for Lena. She was just the\r\nsame as when she was waiting with her baby. She just dragged around\r\nand was careless with her clothes and all lifeless, and she acted\r\nalways and lived on just as if she had no feeling. She always did\r\neverything regular with the work, the way she always had had to do it,\r\nbut she never got back any spirit in her. Herman was always good and\r\nkind, and always helped her with her working. He did everything he\r\nknew to help her. He always did all the active new things in the house\r\nand for the baby. Lena did what she had to do the way she always had\r\nbeen taught it. She always just kept going now with her working, and\r\nshe was always careless, and dirty, and a little dazed, and lifeless.\r\nLena never got any better in herself of this way of being that she had\r\nhad ever since she had been married.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haydon never saw any more of her niece, Lena. Mrs. Haydon had now\r\nso much trouble with her own house, and her daughters getting married,\r\nand her boy, who was growing up, and who always was getting so much\r\nworse to manage. She knew she had done right by Lena. Herman Kreder\r\nwas a good man, she would be glad to get one so good, sometimes,\r\nfor her own daughters, and now they had a home to live in together,\r\nseparate from the old people, who had made their trouble for them.\r\nMrs. Haydon felt she had done very well by her niece, Lena, and she\r\nnever thought now she needed any more to go and see her. Lena would do\r\nvery well now without her aunt to trouble herself any more about her.\r\n\r\nThe good german cook who had always scolded, still tried to do her\r\nduty like a mother to poor Lena. It was very hard now to do right by\r\nLena. Lena never seemed to hear now what anyone was saying to her.\r\nHerman was always doing everything he could to help her. Herman\r\nalways, when he was home, took good care of the baby. Herman loved\r\nto take care of his baby. Lena never thought to take him out or to do\r\nanything she didn\'t have to.\r\n\r\nThe good cook sometimes made Lena come to see her. Lena would come\r\nwith her baby and sit there in the kitchen, and watch the good woman\r\ncooking, and listen to her sometimes a little, the way she used to,\r\nwhile the good german woman scolded her for going around looking so\r\ncareless when now she had no trouble, and sitting there so dull, and\r\nalways being just so thankless. Sometimes Lena would wake up a little\r\nand get back into her face her old, gentle, patient, and unsuffering\r\nsweetness, but mostly Lena did not seem to hear much when the good\r\ngerman woman scolded. Lena always liked it when Mrs. Aldrich her good\r\nmistress spoke to her kindly, and then Lena would seem to go back\r\nand feel herself to be like she was when she had been in service.\r\nBut mostly Lena just lived along and was careless in her clothes, and\r\ndull, and lifeless.\r\n\r\nBy and by Lena had two more little babies. Lena was not so much scared\r\nnow when she had the babies. She did not seem to notice very much\r\nwhen they hurt her, and she never seemed to feel very much now about\r\nanything that happened to her.\r\n\r\nThey were very nice babies, all these three that Lena had, and Herman\r\ntook good care of them always. Herman never really cared much about\r\nhis wife, Lena. The only things Herman ever really cared for were his\r\nbabies. Herman always was very good to his children. He always had a\r\ngentle, tender way when he held them. He learned to be very handy with\r\nthem. He spent all the time he was not working, with them. By and by\r\nhe began to work all day in his own home so that he could have his\r\nchildren always in the same room with him.\r\n\r\nLena always was more and more lifeless and Herman now mostly never\r\nthought about her. He more and more took all the care of their three\r\nchildren. He saw to their eating right and their washing, and he\r\ndressed them every morning, and he taught them the right way to do\r\nthings, and he put them to their sleeping, and he was now always every\r\nminute with them. Then there was to come to them, a fourth baby. Lena\r\nwent to the hospital near by to have the baby. Lena seemed to be going\r\nto have much trouble with it. When the baby was come out at last, it\r\nwas like its mother lifeless. While it was coming, Lena had grown very\r\npale and sicker. When it was all over Lena had died, too, and nobody\r\nknew just how it had happened to her.\r\n\r\nThe good german cook who had always scolded Lena, and had always to\r\nthe last day tried to help her, was the only one who ever missed\r\nher. She remembered how nice Lena had looked all the time she was\r\nin service with her, and how her voice had been so gentle and\r\nsweet-sounding, and how she always was a good girl, and how she never\r\nhad to have any trouble with her, the way she always had with all the\r\nother girls who had been taken into the house to help her. The good\r\ncook sometimes spoke so of Lena when she had time to have a talk with\r\nMrs. Aldrich, and this was all the remembering there now ever was of\r\nLena.\r\n\r\nHerman Kreder now always lived very happy, very gentle, very quiet,\r\nvery well content alone with his three children. He never had a woman\r\nany more to be all the time around him. He always did all his own\r\nwork in his house, when he was through every day with the work he was\r\nalways doing for his father. Herman always was alone, and he always\r\nworked alone, until his little ones were big enough to help him.\r\nHerman Kreder was very well content now and he always lived very\r\nregular and peaceful, and with every day just like the next one,\r\nalways alone now with his three good, gentle children.\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Three Lives, by Gertrude Stein\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THREE LIVES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 15408.txt or 15408.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/4/0/15408/\r\n\r\nProduced by S.R.Ellison, Suzanne Shell, and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
