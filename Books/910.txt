The\r\ntrees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of\r\nfrost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous,\r\nin the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land\r\nitself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold\r\nthat the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in\r\nit of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlaughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold\r\nas the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the\r\nmasterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the\r\nfutility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage,\r\nfrozen-hearted Northland Wild.\r\n\r\nBut there _was_ life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen\r\nwaterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed\r\nwith frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths,\r\nspouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their\r\nbodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the\r\ndogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along\r\nbehind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark,\r\nand its full surface rested on the snow. The front end of the sled was\r\nturned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of\r\nsoft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely\r\nlashed, was a long and narrow oblong box. There were other things on\r\nthe sled\xe2\x80\x94blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but\r\nprominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nIn advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of\r\nthe sled toiled a second man. On the sled, in the box, lay a third man\r\nwhose toil was over,\xe2\x80\x94a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down\r\nuntil he would never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the\r\nWild to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is movement;\r\nand the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to\r\nprevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till\r\nthey are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most ferociously and\r\nterribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man\xe2\x80\x94man\r\nwho is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum\r\nthat all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.\r\n\r\nBut at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who\r\nwere not yet dead. Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned\r\nleather. Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals\r\nfrom their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. This\r\ngave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral\r\nworld at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men,\r\npenetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny\r\nadventurers bent on colossal adventure, pitting themselves against the\r\nmight of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThey travelled on without speech, saving their breath for the work of\r\ntheir bodies. On every side was the silence, pressing upon them with a\r\ntangible presence. It affected their minds as the many atmospheres of\r\ndeep water affect the body of the diver. It crushed them with the\r\nweight of unending vastness and unalterable decree. It crushed them\r\ninto the remotest recesses of their own minds, pressing out of them,\r\nlike juices from the grape, all the false ardours and exaltations and\r\nundue self-values of the human soul, until they perceived themselves\r\nfinite and small, specks and motes, moving with weak cunning and little\r\nwisdom amidst the play and inter-play of the great blind elements and\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nAn hour went by, and a second hour. The pale light of the short sunless\r\nday was beginning to fade, when a faint far cry arose on the still air.\r\nIt soared upward with a swift rush, till it reached its topmost note,\r\nwhere it persisted, palpitant and tense, and then slowly died away. It\r\nmight have been a lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a\r\ncertain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness. The front man turned his\r\nhead until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind. And then, across\r\nthe narrow oblong box, each nodded to the other.\r\n\r\nA second cry arose, piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness.\r\nBoth men located the sound. It was to the rear, somewhere in the snow\r\nexpanse they had just traversed. A third and answering cry arose, also\r\nto the rear and to the left of the second cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re after us, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man at the front.\r\n\r\nHis voice sounded hoarse and unreal, and he had spoken with apparent\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeat is scarce,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his comrade. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t seen a rabbit sign for\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereafter they spoke no more, though their ears were keen for the\r\nhunting-cries that continued to rise behind them.\r\n\r\nAt the fall of darkness they swung the dogs into a cluster of spruce\r\ntrees on the edge of the waterway and made a camp. The coffin, at the\r\nside of the fire, served for seat and table. The wolf-dogs, clustered\r\non the far side of the fire, snarled and bickered among themselves, but\r\nevinced no inclination to stray off into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeems to me, Henry, they\xe2\x80\x99re stayin\xe2\x80\x99 remarkable close to camp,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill\r\ncommented.\r\n\r\nHenry, squatting over the fire and settling the pot of coffee with a\r\npiece of ice, nodded. Nor did he speak till he had taken his seat on\r\nthe coffin and begun to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey know where their hides is safe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d sooner eat grub\r\nthan be grub. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty wise, them dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBill shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis comrade looked at him curiously. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst time I ever heard you say\r\nanything about their not bein\xe2\x80\x99 wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, munching with deliberation the beans he was\r\neating, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you happen to notice the way them dogs kicked up when I\r\nwas a-feedin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey did cut up more\xe2\x80\x99n usual,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many dogs \xe2\x80\x99ve we got, Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Henry . . . \xe2\x80\x9d Bill stopped for a moment, in order that his words\r\nmight gain greater significance. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I was sayin\xe2\x80\x99, Henry, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got six\r\ndogs. I took six fish out of the bag. I gave one fish to each dog, an\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nHenry, I was one fish short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou counted wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got six dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d the other reiterated dispassionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI took out\r\nsix fish. One Ear didn\xe2\x80\x99t get no fish. I came back to the bag afterward\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 got \xe2\x80\x99m his fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve only got six dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t say they was all dogs, but there was\r\nseven of \xe2\x80\x99m that got fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry stopped eating to glance across the fire and count the dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only six now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the other one run off across the snow,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill announced with cool\r\npositiveness. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry looked at him commiseratingly, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be almighty glad\r\nwhen this trip\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d Bill demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that this load of ourn is gettin\xe2\x80\x99 on your nerves, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re beginnin\xe2\x80\x99 to see things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill answered gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 so, when I saw it run\r\noff across the snow, I looked in the snow an\xe2\x80\x99 saw its tracks. Then I\r\ncounted the dogs an\xe2\x80\x99 there was still six of \xe2\x80\x99em. The tracks is there in\r\nthe snow now. D\xe2\x80\x99ye want to look at \xe2\x80\x99em? I\xe2\x80\x99ll show \xe2\x80\x99em to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry did not reply, but munched on in silence, until, the meal\r\nfinished, he topped it with a final cup of coffee. He wiped his mouth\r\nwith the back of his hand and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 as it was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long wailing cry, fiercely sad, from somewhere in the darkness, had\r\ninterrupted him. He stopped to listen to it, then he finished his\r\nsentence with a wave of his hand toward the sound of the cry, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBill nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d a blame sight sooner think that than anything else.\r\nYou noticed yourself the row the dogs made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCry after cry, and answering cries, were turning the silence into a\r\nbedlam. From every side the cries arose, and the dogs betrayed their\r\nfear by huddling together and so close to the fire that their hair was\r\nscorched by the heat. Bill threw on more wood, before lighting his\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking you\xe2\x80\x99re down in the mouth some,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry . . . \xe2\x80\x9d He sucked meditatively at his pipe for some time before\r\nhe went on. \xe2\x80\x9cHenry, I was a-thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 what a blame sight luckier he is\r\nthan you an\xe2\x80\x99 me\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe indicated the third person by a downward thrust of the thumb to the\r\nbox on which they sat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou an\xe2\x80\x99 me, Henry, when we die, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be lucky if we get enough stones\r\nover our carcases to keep the dogs off of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we ain\xe2\x80\x99t got people an\xe2\x80\x99 money an\xe2\x80\x99 all the rest, like him,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry\r\nrejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cLong-distance funerals is somethin\xe2\x80\x99 you an\xe2\x80\x99 me can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly\r\nafford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat gets me, Henry, is what a chap like this, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lord or\r\nsomething in his own country, and that\xe2\x80\x99s never had to bother about grub\r\nnor blankets; why he comes a-buttin\xe2\x80\x99 round the Godforsaken ends of the\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might have lived to a ripe old age if he\xe2\x80\x99d stayed at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nBill opened his mouth to speak, but changed his mind. Instead, he\r\npointed towards the wall of darkness that pressed about them from every\r\nside. There was no suggestion of form in the utter blackness; only\r\ncould be seen a pair of eyes gleaming like live coals. Henry indicated\r\nwith his head a second pair, and a third. A circle of the gleaming eyes\r\nhad drawn about their camp. Now and again a pair of eyes moved, or\r\ndisappeared to appear again a moment later.\r\n\r\nThe unrest of the dogs had been increasing, and they stampeded, in a\r\nsurge of sudden fear, to the near side of the fire, cringing and\r\ncrawling about the legs of the men. In the scramble one of the dogs had\r\nbeen overturned on the edge of the fire, and it had yelped with pain\r\nand fright as the smell of its singed coat possessed the air. The\r\ncommotion caused the circle of eyes to shift restlessly for a moment\r\nand even to withdraw a bit, but it settled down again as the dogs\r\nbecame quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry, it\xe2\x80\x99s a blame misfortune to be out of ammunition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBill had finished his pipe and was helping his companion to spread the\r\nbed of fur and blanket upon the spruce boughs which he had laid over\r\nthe snow before supper. Henry grunted, and began unlacing his\r\nmoccasins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many cartridges did you say you had left?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree,\xe2\x80\x9d came the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I wisht \xe2\x80\x99twas three hundred. Then I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nshow \xe2\x80\x99em what for, damn \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his fist angrily at the gleaming eyes, and began securely to\r\nprop his moccasins before the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I wisht this cold snap\xe2\x80\x99d break,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ben fifty below\r\nfor two weeks now. An\xe2\x80\x99 I wisht I\xe2\x80\x99d never started on this trip, Henry. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like the looks of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel right, somehow. An\xe2\x80\x99 while I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwishin\xe2\x80\x99, I wisht the trip was over an\xe2\x80\x99 done with, an\xe2\x80\x99 you an\xe2\x80\x99 me\r\na-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 by the fire in Fort McGurry just about now an\xe2\x80\x99 playing\r\ncribbage\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I wisht.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry grunted and crawled into bed. As he dozed off he was aroused by\r\nhis comrade\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Henry, that other one that come in an\xe2\x80\x99 got a fish\xe2\x80\x94why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\ndogs pitch into it? That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s botherin\xe2\x80\x99 me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re botherin\xe2\x80\x99 too much, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d came the sleepy response. \xe2\x80\x9cYou was\r\nnever like this before. You jes\xe2\x80\x99 shut up now, an\xe2\x80\x99 go to sleep, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be all hunkydory in the mornin\xe2\x80\x99. Your stomach\xe2\x80\x99s sour, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s botherin\xe2\x80\x99 you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men slept, breathing heavily, side by side, under the one covering.\r\nThe fire died down, and the gleaming eyes drew closer the circle they\r\nhad flung about the camp. The dogs clustered together in fear, now and\r\nagain snarling menacingly as a pair of eyes drew close. Once their\r\nuproar became so loud that Bill woke up. He got out of bed carefully,\r\nso as not to disturb the sleep of his comrade, and threw more wood on\r\nthe fire. As it began to flame up, the circle of eyes drew farther\r\nback. He glanced casually at the huddling dogs. He rubbed his eyes and\r\nlooked at them more sharply. Then he crawled back into the blankets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry groaned as he passed from sleep to waking, and demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwrong now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d came the answer; \xe2\x80\x9conly there\xe2\x80\x99s seven of \xe2\x80\x99em again. I just\r\ncounted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry acknowledged receipt of the information with a grunt that slid\r\ninto a snore as he drifted back into sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning it was Henry who awoke first and routed his companion\r\nout of bed. Daylight was yet three hours away, though it was already\r\nsix o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and in the darkness Henry went about preparing breakfast,\r\nwhile Bill rolled the blankets and made the sled ready for lashing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9chow many dogs did you say we had?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill proclaimed triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven again?\xe2\x80\x9d Henry queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, five; one\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hell!\xe2\x80\x9d Henry cried in wrath, leaving the cooking to come and count\r\nthe dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cFatty\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he went like greased lightnin\xe2\x80\x99 once he got started. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen \xe2\x80\x99m for smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo chance at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cThey jes\xe2\x80\x99 swallowed \xe2\x80\x99m alive. I\r\nbet he was yelpin\xe2\x80\x99 as he went down their throats, damn \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe always was a fool dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no fool dog ought to be fool enough to go off an\xe2\x80\x99 commit suicide\r\nthat way.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked over the remainder of the team with a speculative\r\neye that summed up instantly the salient traits of each animal. \xe2\x80\x9cI bet\r\nnone of the others would do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t drive \xe2\x80\x99em away from the fire with a club,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nalways did think there was somethin\xe2\x80\x99 wrong with Fatty anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this was the epitaph of a dead dog on the Northland trail\xe2\x80\x94less\r\nscant than the epitaph of many another dog, of many a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE SHE-WOLF\r\n\r\n\r\nBreakfast eaten and the slim camp-outfit lashed to the sled, the men\r\nturned their backs on the cheery fire and launched out into the\r\ndarkness. At once began to rise the cries that were fiercely sad\xe2\x80\x94cries\r\nthat called through the darkness and cold to one another and answered\r\nback. Conversation ceased. Daylight came at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. At midday the\r\nsky to the south warmed to rose-colour, and marked where the bulge of\r\nthe earth intervened between the meridian sun and the northern world.\r\nBut the rose-colour swiftly faded. The grey light of day that remained\r\nlasted until three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when it, too, faded, and the pall of the\r\nArctic night descended upon the lone and silent land.\r\n\r\nAs darkness came on, the hunting-cries to right and left and rear drew\r\ncloser\xe2\x80\x94so close that more than once they sent surges of fear through\r\nthe toiling dogs, throwing them into short-lived panics.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of one such panic, when he and Henry had got the dogs\r\nback in the traces, Bill said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wisht they\xe2\x80\x99d strike game somewheres, an\xe2\x80\x99 go away an\xe2\x80\x99 leave us\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do get on the nerves horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry sympathised.\r\n\r\nThey spoke no more until camp was made.\r\n\r\nHenry was bending over and adding ice to the babbling pot of beans when\r\nhe was startled by the sound of a blow, an exclamation from Bill, and a\r\nsharp snarling cry of pain from among the dogs. He straightened up in\r\ntime to see a dim form disappearing across the snow into the shelter of\r\nthe dark. Then he saw Bill, standing amid the dogs, half triumphant,\r\nhalf crestfallen, in one hand a stout club, in the other the tail and\r\npart of the body of a sun-cured salmon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt got half of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I got a whack at it jes\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nsame. D\xe2\x80\x99ye hear it squeal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99d it look like?\xe2\x80\x9d Henry asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see. But it had four legs an\xe2\x80\x99 a mouth an\xe2\x80\x99 hair an\xe2\x80\x99 looked\r\nlike any dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust be a tame wolf, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s damned tame, whatever it is, comin\xe2\x80\x99 in here at feedin\xe2\x80\x99 time an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngettin\xe2\x80\x99 its whack of fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night, when supper was finished and they sat on the oblong box and\r\npulled at their pipes, the circle of gleaming eyes drew in even closer\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wisht they\xe2\x80\x99d spring up a bunch of moose or something, an\xe2\x80\x99 go away\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 leave us alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill said.\r\n\r\nHenry grunted with an intonation that was not all sympathy, and for a\r\nquarter of an hour they sat on in silence, Henry staring at the fire,\r\nand Bill at the circle of eyes that burned in the darkness just beyond\r\nthe firelight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wisht we was pullin\xe2\x80\x99 into McGurry right now,\xe2\x80\x9d he began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up your wishin\xe2\x80\x99 and your croakin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry burst out angrily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour stomach\xe2\x80\x99s sour. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s ailin\xe2\x80\x99 you. Swallow a spoonful of\r\nsody, an\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99ll sweeten up wonderful an\xe2\x80\x99 be more pleasant company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the morning Henry was aroused by fervid blasphemy that proceeded\r\nfrom the mouth of Bill. Henry propped himself up on an elbow and looked\r\nto see his comrade standing among the dogs beside the replenished fire,\r\nhis arms raised in objurgation, his face distorted with passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d Henry called. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrog\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d came the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry leaped out of the blankets and to the dogs. He counted them with\r\ncare, and then joined his partner in cursing the power of the Wild that\r\nhad robbed them of another dog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrog was the strongest dog of the bunch,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill pronounced finally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he was no fool dog neither,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry added.\r\n\r\nAnd so was recorded the second epitaph in two days.\r\n\r\nA gloomy breakfast was eaten, and the four remaining dogs were\r\nharnessed to the sled. The day was a repetition of the days that had\r\ngone before. The men toiled without speech across the face of the\r\nfrozen world. The silence was unbroken save by the cries of their\r\npursuers, that, unseen, hung upon their rear. With the coming of night\r\nin the mid-afternoon, the cries sounded closer as the pursuers drew in\r\naccording to their custom; and the dogs grew excited and frightened,\r\nand were guilty of panics that tangled the traces and further depressed\r\nthe two men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99ll fix you fool critters,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill said with satisfaction\r\nthat night, standing erect at completion of his task.\r\n\r\nHenry left the cooking to come and see. Not only had his partner tied\r\nthe dogs up, but he had tied them, after the Indian fashion, with\r\nsticks. About the neck of each dog he had fastened a leather thong. To\r\nthis, and so close to the neck that the dog could not get his teeth to\r\nit, he had tied a stout stick four or five feet in length. The other\r\nend of the stick, in turn, was made fast to a stake in the ground by\r\nmeans of a leather thong. The dog was unable to gnaw through the\r\nleather at his own end of the stick. The stick prevented him from\r\ngetting at the leather that fastened the other end.\r\n\r\nHenry nodded his head approvingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the only contraption that\xe2\x80\x99ll ever hold One Ear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\r\ngnaw through leather as clean as a knife an\xe2\x80\x99 jes\xe2\x80\x99 about half as quick.\r\nThey all\xe2\x80\x99ll be here in the mornin\xe2\x80\x99 hunkydory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jes\xe2\x80\x99 bet they will,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill affirmed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf one of em\xe2\x80\x99 turns up\r\nmissin\xe2\x80\x99, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go without my coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey jes\xe2\x80\x99 know we ain\xe2\x80\x99t loaded to kill,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry remarked at bed-time,\r\nindicating the gleaming circle that hemmed them in. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we could put a\r\ncouple of shots into \xe2\x80\x99em, they\xe2\x80\x99d be more respectful. They come closer\r\nevery night. Get the firelight out of your eyes an\xe2\x80\x99 look hard\xe2\x80\x94there!\r\nDid you see that one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time the two men amused themselves with watching the movement\r\nof vague forms on the edge of the firelight. By looking closely and\r\nsteadily at where a pair of eyes burned in the darkness, the form of\r\nthe animal would slowly take shape. They could even see these forms\r\nmove at times.\r\n\r\nA sound among the dogs attracted the men\xe2\x80\x99s attention. One Ear was\r\nuttering quick, eager whines, lunging at the length of his stick toward\r\nthe darkness, and desisting now and again in order to make frantic\r\nattacks on the stick with his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry whispered.\r\n\r\nFull into the firelight, with a stealthy, sidelong movement, glided a\r\ndoglike animal. It moved with commingled mistrust and daring,\r\ncautiously observing the men, its attention fixed on the dogs. One Ear\r\nstrained the full length of the stick toward the intruder and whined\r\nwith eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat fool One Ear don\xe2\x80\x99t seem scairt much,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill said in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a she-wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry whispered back, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 that accounts for Fatty\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 Frog. She\xe2\x80\x99s the decoy for the pack. She draws out the dog an\xe2\x80\x99 then\r\nall the rest pitches in an\xe2\x80\x99 eats \xe2\x80\x99m up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fire crackled. A log fell apart with a loud spluttering noise. At\r\nthe sound of it the strange animal leaped back into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-thinkin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill announced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThinkin\xe2\x80\x99 what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a-thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 that was the one I lambasted with the club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t the slightest doubt in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d was Henry\xe2\x80\x99s response.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 right here I want to remark,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat that animal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamilyarity with campfires is suspicious an\xe2\x80\x99 immoral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt knows for certain more\xe2\x80\x99n a self-respectin\xe2\x80\x99 wolf ought to know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHenry agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cA wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at\r\nfeedin\xe2\x80\x99 time has had experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOl\xe2\x80\x99 Villan had a dog once that run away with the wolves,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill\r\ncogitates aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to know. I shot it out of the pack in a moose\r\npasture over \xe2\x80\x98on Little Stick. An\xe2\x80\x99 Ol\xe2\x80\x99 Villan cried like a baby. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen it for three years, he said. Ben with the wolves all that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you\xe2\x80\x99ve called the turn, Bill. That wolf\xe2\x80\x99s a dog, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neaten fish many\xe2\x80\x99s the time from the hand of man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn if I get a chance at it, that wolf that\xe2\x80\x99s a dog\xe2\x80\x99ll be jes\xe2\x80\x99 meat,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBill declared. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose no more animals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve only got three cartridges,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for a dead sure shot,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Henry renewed the fire and cooked breakfast to the\r\naccompaniment of his partner\xe2\x80\x99s snoring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was sleepin\xe2\x80\x99 jes\xe2\x80\x99 too comfortable for anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry told him,\r\nas he routed him out for breakfast. \xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to rouse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBill began to eat sleepily. He noticed that his cup was empty and\r\nstarted to reach for the pot. But the pot was beyond arm\xe2\x80\x99s length and\r\nbeside Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d he chided gently, \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t you forgot somethin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry looked about with great carefulness and shook his head. Bill held\r\nup the empty cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t get no coffee,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry announced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t run out?\xe2\x80\x9d Bill asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt my digestion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flush of angry blood pervaded Bill\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s jes\xe2\x80\x99 warm an\xe2\x80\x99 anxious I am to be hearin\xe2\x80\x99 you explain\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpanker\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry answered.\r\n\r\nWithout haste, with the air of one resigned to misfortune Bill turned\r\nhis head, and from where he sat counted the dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked apathetically.\r\n\r\nHenry shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know. Unless One Ear gnawed \xe2\x80\x99m\r\nloose. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t a-done it himself, that\xe2\x80\x99s sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe darned cuss.\xe2\x80\x9d Bill spoke gravely and slowly, with no hint of the\r\nanger that was raging within. \xe2\x80\x9cJes\xe2\x80\x99 because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t chew himself\r\nloose, he chews Spanker loose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Spanker\xe2\x80\x99s troubles is over anyway; I guess he\xe2\x80\x99s digested by this\r\ntime an\xe2\x80\x99 cavortin\xe2\x80\x99 over the landscape in the bellies of twenty\r\ndifferent wolves,\xe2\x80\x9d was Henry\xe2\x80\x99s epitaph on this, the latest lost dog.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some coffee, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Bill shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry pleaded, elevating the pot.\r\n\r\nBill shoved his cup aside. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be ding-dong-danged if I do. I said I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if ary dog turned up missin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s darn good coffee,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry said enticingly.\r\n\r\nBut Bill was stubborn, and he ate a dry breakfast washed down with\r\nmumbled curses at One Ear for the trick he had played.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tie \xe2\x80\x99em up out of reach of each other to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill said, as\r\nthey took the trail.\r\n\r\nThey had travelled little more than a hundred yards, when Henry, who\r\nwas in front, bent down and picked up something with which his snowshoe\r\nhad collided. It was dark, and he could not see it, but he recognised\r\nit by the touch. He flung it back, so that it struck the sled and\r\nbounced along until it fetched up on Bill\xe2\x80\x99s snowshoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMebbe you\xe2\x80\x99ll need that in your business,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry said.\r\n\r\nBill uttered an exclamation. It was all that was left of Spanker\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstick with which he had been tied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ate \xe2\x80\x99m hide an\xe2\x80\x99 all,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill announced. \xe2\x80\x9cThe stick\xe2\x80\x99s as clean as a\r\nwhistle. They\xe2\x80\x99ve ate the leather offen both ends. They\xe2\x80\x99re damn hungry,\r\nHenry, an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99ll have you an\xe2\x80\x99 me guessin\xe2\x80\x99 before this trip\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry laughed defiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t been trailed this way by wolves\r\nbefore, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through a whole lot worse an\xe2\x80\x99 kept my health.\r\nTakes more\xe2\x80\x99n a handful of them pesky critters to do for yours truly,\r\nBill, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill muttered ominously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know all right when we pull into McGurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t feelin\xe2\x80\x99 special enthusiastic,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re off colour, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry\r\ndogmatised. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you need is quinine, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to dose you up\r\nstiff as soon as we make McGurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBill grunted his disagreement with the diagnosis, and lapsed into\r\nsilence. The day was like all the days. Light came at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. At\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock the southern horizon was warmed by the unseen sun; and\r\nthen began the cold grey of afternoon that would merge, three hours\r\nlater, into night.\r\n\r\nIt was just after the sun\xe2\x80\x99s futile effort to appear, that Bill slipped\r\nthe rifle from under the sled-lashings and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou keep right on, Henry, I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to see what I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better stick by the sled,\xe2\x80\x9d his partner protested. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only\r\ngot three cartridges, an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s no tellin\xe2\x80\x99 what might happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s croaking now?\xe2\x80\x9d Bill demanded triumphantly.\r\n\r\nHenry made no reply, and plodded on alone, though often he cast anxious\r\nglances back into the grey solitude where his partner had disappeared.\r\nAn hour later, taking advantage of the cut-offs around which the sled\r\nhad to go, Bill arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re scattered an\xe2\x80\x99 rangin\xe2\x80\x99 along wide,\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping up with\r\nus an\xe2\x80\x99 lookin\xe2\x80\x99 for game at the same time. You see, they\xe2\x80\x99re sure of us,\r\nonly they know they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wait to get us. In the meantime they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwillin\xe2\x80\x99 to pick up anything eatable that comes handy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean they _think_ they\xe2\x80\x99re sure of us,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry objected pointedly.\r\n\r\nBut Bill ignored him. \xe2\x80\x9cI seen some of them. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty thin. They\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t had a bite in weeks I reckon, outside of Fatty an\xe2\x80\x99 Frog an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSpanker; an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s so many of \xe2\x80\x99em that that didn\xe2\x80\x99t go far. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nremarkable thin. Their ribs is like wash-boards, an\xe2\x80\x99 their stomachs is\r\nright up against their backbones. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty desperate, I can tell\r\nyou. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be goin\xe2\x80\x99 mad, yet, an\xe2\x80\x99 then watch out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, Henry, who was now travelling behind the sled,\r\nemitted a low, warning whistle. Bill turned and looked, then quietly\r\nstopped the dogs. To the rear, from around the last bend and plainly\r\ninto view, on the very trail they had just covered, trotted a furry,\r\nslinking form. Its nose was to the trail, and it trotted with a\r\npeculiar, sliding, effortless gait. When they halted, it halted,\r\nthrowing up its head and regarding them steadily with nostrils that\r\ntwitched as it caught and studied the scent of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the she-wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill answered.\r\n\r\nThe dogs had lain down in the snow, and he walked past them to join his\r\npartner in the sled. Together they watched the strange animal that had\r\npursued them for days and that had already accomplished the destruction\r\nof half their dog-team.\r\n\r\nAfter a searching scrutiny, the animal trotted forward a few steps.\r\nThis it repeated several times, till it was a short hundred yards away.\r\nIt paused, head up, close by a clump of spruce trees, and with sight\r\nand scent studied the outfit of the watching men. It looked at them in\r\na strangely wistful way, after the manner of a dog; but in its\r\nwistfulness there was none of the dog affection. It was a wistfulness\r\nbred of hunger, as cruel as its own fangs, as merciless as the frost\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt was large for a wolf, its gaunt frame advertising the lines of an\r\nanimal that was among the largest of its kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStands pretty close to two feet an\xe2\x80\x99 a half at the shoulders,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry\r\ncommented. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet it ain\xe2\x80\x99t far from five feet long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind of strange colour for a wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d was Bill\xe2\x80\x99s criticism. \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\nseen a red wolf before. Looks almost cinnamon to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe animal was certainly not cinnamon-coloured. Its coat was the true\r\nwolf-coat. The dominant colour was grey, and yet there was to it a\r\nfaint reddish hue\xe2\x80\x94a hue that was baffling, that appeared and\r\ndisappeared, that was more like an illusion of the vision, now grey,\r\ndistinctly grey, and again giving hints and glints of a vague redness\r\nof colour not classifiable in terms of ordinary experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks for all the world like a big husky sled-dog,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be s\xe2\x80\x99prised to see it wag its tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, you husky!\xe2\x80\x9d he called. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, you whatever-your-name-is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t a bit scairt of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry laughed.\r\n\r\nBill waved his hand at it threateningly and shouted loudly; but the\r\nanimal betrayed no fear. The only change in it that they could notice\r\nwas an accession of alertness. It still regarded them with the\r\nmerciless wistfulness of hunger. They were meat, and it was hungry; and\r\nit would like to go in and eat them if it dared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill said, unconsciously lowering his voice to a\r\nwhisper because of what he imitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got three cartridges. But\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a dead shot. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss it. It\xe2\x80\x99s got away with three of our\r\ndogs, an\xe2\x80\x99 we oughter put a stop to it. What d\xe2\x80\x99ye say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry nodded his consent. Bill cautiously slipped the gun from under\r\nthe sled-lashing. The gun was on the way to his shoulder, but it never\r\ngot there. For in that instant the she-wolf leaped sidewise from the\r\ntrail into the clump of spruce trees and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other. Henry whistled long and\r\ncomprehendingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have knowed it,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill chided himself aloud as he replaced the\r\ngun. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course a wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at\r\nfeedin\xe2\x80\x99 time, \xe2\x80\x99d know all about shooting-irons. I tell you right now,\r\nHenry, that critter\xe2\x80\x99s the cause of all our trouble. We\xe2\x80\x99d have six dogs\r\nat the present time, \xe2\x80\x99stead of three, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for her. An\xe2\x80\x99 I tell\r\nyou right now, Henry, I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get her. She\xe2\x80\x99s too smart to be shot\r\nin the open. But I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to lay for her. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bushwhack her as sure\r\nas my name is Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t stray off too far in doin\xe2\x80\x99 it,\xe2\x80\x9d his partner admonished.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that pack ever starts to jump you, them three cartridges\xe2\x80\x99d be wuth\r\nno more\xe2\x80\x99n three whoops in hell. Them animals is damn hungry, an\xe2\x80\x99 once\r\nthey start in, they\xe2\x80\x99ll sure get you, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey camped early that night. Three dogs could not drag the sled so\r\nfast nor for so long hours as could six, and they were showing\r\nunmistakable signs of playing out. And the men went early to bed, Bill\r\nfirst seeing to it that the dogs were tied out of gnawing-reach of one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBut the wolves were growing bolder, and the men were aroused more than\r\nonce from their sleep. So near did the wolves approach, that the dogs\r\nbecame frantic with terror, and it was necessary to replenish the fire\r\nfrom time to time in order to keep the adventurous marauders at safer\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve hearn sailors talk of sharks followin\xe2\x80\x99 a ship,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill remarked, as\r\nhe crawled back into the blankets after one such replenishing of the\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, them wolves is land sharks. They know their business\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x99n we do, an\xe2\x80\x99 they ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-holdin\xe2\x80\x99 our trail this way for their\r\nhealth. They\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get us. They\xe2\x80\x99re sure goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get us, Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve half got you a\xe2\x80\x99ready, a-talkin\xe2\x80\x99 like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry retorted\r\nsharply. \xe2\x80\x9cA man\xe2\x80\x99s half licked when he says he is. An\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99re half eaten\r\nfrom the way you\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 on about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got away with better men than you an\xe2\x80\x99 me,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shet up your croakin\xe2\x80\x99. You make me all-fired tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry rolled over angrily on his side, but was surprised that Bill made\r\nno similar display of temper. This was not Bill\xe2\x80\x99s way, for he was\r\neasily angered by sharp words. Henry thought long over it before he\r\nwent to sleep, and as his eyelids fluttered down and he dozed off, the\r\nthought in his mind was: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no mistakin\xe2\x80\x99 it, Bill\xe2\x80\x99s almighty\r\nblue. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to cheer him up to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE HUNGER CRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day began auspiciously. They had lost no dogs during the night, and\r\nthey swung out upon the trail and into the silence, the darkness, and\r\nthe cold with spirits that were fairly light. Bill seemed to have\r\nforgotten his forebodings of the previous night, and even waxed\r\nfacetious with the dogs when, at midday, they overturned the sled on a\r\nbad piece of trail.\r\n\r\nIt was an awkward mix-up. The sled was upside down and jammed between a\r\ntree-trunk and a huge rock, and they were forced to unharness the dogs\r\nin order to straighten out the tangle. The two men were bent over the\r\nsled and trying to right it, when Henry observed One Ear sidling away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you, One Ear!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, straightening up and turning around on\r\nthe dog.\r\n\r\nBut One Ear broke into a run across the snow, his traces trailing\r\nbehind him. And there, out in the snow of their back track, was the\r\nshe-wolf waiting for him. As he neared her, he became suddenly\r\ncautious. He slowed down to an alert and mincing walk and then stopped.\r\nHe regarded her carefully and dubiously, yet desirefully. She seemed to\r\nsmile at him, showing her teeth in an ingratiating rather than a\r\nmenacing way. She moved toward him a few steps, playfully, and then\r\nhalted. One Ear drew near to her, still alert and cautious, his tail\r\nand ears in the air, his head held high.\r\n\r\nHe tried to sniff noses with her, but she retreated playfully and\r\ncoyly. Every advance on his part was accompanied by a corresponding\r\nretreat on her part. Step by step she was luring him away from the\r\nsecurity of his human companionship. Once, as though a warning had in\r\nvague ways flitted through his intelligence, he turned his head and\r\nlooked back at the overturned sled, at his team-mates, and at the two\r\nmen who were calling to him.\r\n\r\nBut whatever idea was forming in his mind, was dissipated by the\r\nshe-wolf, who advanced upon him, sniffed noses with him for a fleeting\r\ninstant, and then resumed her coy retreat before his renewed advances.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Bill had bethought himself of the rifle. But it was\r\njammed beneath the overturned sled, and by the time Henry had helped\r\nhim to right the load, One Ear and the she-wolf were too close together\r\nand the distance too great to risk a shot.\r\n\r\nToo late One Ear learned his mistake. Before they saw the cause, the\r\ntwo men saw him turn and start to run back toward them. Then,\r\napproaching at right angles to the trail and cutting off his retreat\r\nthey saw a dozen wolves, lean and grey, bounding across the snow. On\r\nthe instant, the she-wolf\xe2\x80\x99s coyness and playfulness disappeared. With a\r\nsnarl she sprang upon One Ear. He thrust her off with his shoulder,\r\nand, his retreat cut off and still intent on regaining the sled, he\r\naltered his course in an attempt to circle around to it. More wolves\r\nwere appearing every moment and joining in the chase. The she-wolf was\r\none leap behind One Ear and holding her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you goin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Henry suddenly demanded, laying his hand on his\r\npartner\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\nBill shook it off. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t stand it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nget any more of our dogs if I can help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGun in hand, he plunged into the underbrush that lined the side of the\r\ntrail. His intention was apparent enough. Taking the sled as the centre\r\nof the circle that One Ear was making, Bill planned to tap that circle\r\nat a point in advance of the pursuit. With his rifle, in the broad\r\ndaylight, it might be possible for him to awe the wolves and save the\r\ndog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d Henry called after him. \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful! Don\xe2\x80\x99t take no\r\nchances!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry sat down on the sled and watched. There was nothing else for him\r\nto do. Bill had already gone from sight; but now and again, appearing\r\nand disappearing amongst the underbrush and the scattered clumps of\r\nspruce, could be seen One Ear. Henry judged his case to be hopeless.\r\nThe dog was thoroughly alive to its danger, but it was running on the\r\nouter circle while the wolf-pack was running on the inner and shorter\r\ncircle. It was vain to think of One Ear so outdistancing his pursuers\r\nas to be able to cut across their circle in advance of them and to\r\nregain the sled.\r\n\r\nThe different lines were rapidly approaching a point. Somewhere out\r\nthere in the snow, screened from his sight by trees and thickets, Henry\r\nknew that the wolf-pack, One Ear, and Bill were coming together. All\r\ntoo quickly, far more quickly than he had expected, it happened. He\r\nheard a shot, then two shots, in rapid succession, and he knew that\r\nBill\xe2\x80\x99s ammunition was gone. Then he heard a great outcry of snarls and\r\nyelps. He recognised One Ear\xe2\x80\x99s yell of pain and terror, and he heard a\r\nwolf-cry that bespoke a stricken animal. And that was all. The snarls\r\nceased. The yelping died away. Silence settled down again over the\r\nlonely land.\r\n\r\nHe sat for a long while upon the sled. There was no need for him to go\r\nand see what had happened. He knew it as though it had taken place\r\nbefore his eyes. Once, he roused with a start and hastily got the axe\r\nout from underneath the lashings. But for some time longer he sat and\r\nbrooded, the two remaining dogs crouching and trembling at his feet.\r\n\r\nAt last he arose in a weary manner, as though all the resilience had\r\ngone out of his body, and proceeded to fasten the dogs to the sled. He\r\npassed a rope over his shoulder, a man-trace, and pulled with the dogs.\r\nHe did not go far. At the first hint of darkness he hastened to make a\r\ncamp, and he saw to it that he had a generous supply of firewood. He\r\nfed the dogs, cooked and ate his supper, and made his bed close to the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nBut he was not destined to enjoy that bed. Before his eyes closed the\r\nwolves had drawn too near for safety. It no longer required an effort\r\nof the vision to see them. They were all about him and the fire, in a\r\nnarrow circle, and he could see them plainly in the firelight lying\r\ndown, sitting up, crawling forward on their bellies, or slinking back\r\nand forth. They even slept. Here and there he could see one curled up\r\nin the snow like a dog, taking the sleep that was now denied himself.\r\n\r\nHe kept the fire brightly blazing, for he knew that it alone intervened\r\nbetween the flesh of his body and their hungry fangs. His two dogs\r\nstayed close by him, one on either side, leaning against him for\r\nprotection, crying and whimpering, and at times snarling desperately\r\nwhen a wolf approached a little closer than usual. At such moments,\r\nwhen his dogs snarled, the whole circle would be agitated, the wolves\r\ncoming to their feet and pressing tentatively forward, a chorus of\r\nsnarls and eager yelps rising about him. Then the circle would lie down\r\nagain, and here and there a wolf would resume its broken nap.\r\n\r\nBut this circle had a continuous tendency to draw in upon him. Bit by\r\nbit, an inch at a time, with here a wolf bellying forward, and there a\r\nwolf bellying forward, the circle would narrow until the brutes were\r\nalmost within springing distance. Then he would seize brands from the\r\nfire and hurl them into the pack. A hasty drawing back always resulted,\r\naccompanied by angry yelps and frightened snarls when a well-aimed\r\nbrand struck and scorched a too daring animal.\r\n\r\nMorning found the man haggard and worn, wide-eyed from want of sleep.\r\nHe cooked breakfast in the darkness, and at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when, with\r\nthe coming of daylight, the wolf-pack drew back, he set about the task\r\nhe had planned through the long hours of the night. Chopping down young\r\nsaplings, he made them cross-bars of a scaffold by lashing them high up\r\nto the trunks of standing trees. Using the sled-lashing for a heaving\r\nrope, and with the aid of the dogs, he hoisted the coffin to the top of\r\nthe scaffold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey got Bill, an\xe2\x80\x99 they may get me, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll sure never get you,\r\nyoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the dead body in its tree-sepulchre.\r\n\r\nThen he took the trail, the lightened sled bounding along behind the\r\nwilling dogs; for they, too, knew that safety lay open in the gaining\r\nof Fort McGurry. The wolves were now more open in their pursuit,\r\ntrotting sedately behind and ranging along on either side, their red\r\ntongues lolling out, their lean sides showing the undulating ribs with\r\nevery movement. They were very lean, mere skin-bags stretched over bony\r\nframes, with strings for muscles\xe2\x80\x94so lean that Henry found it in his\r\nmind to marvel that they still kept their feet and did not collapse\r\nforthright in the snow.\r\n\r\nHe did not dare travel until dark. At midday, not only did the sun warm\r\nthe southern horizon, but it even thrust its upper rim, pale and\r\ngolden, above the sky-line. He received it as a sign. The days were\r\ngrowing longer. The sun was returning. But scarcely had the cheer of\r\nits light departed, than he went into camp. There were still several\r\nhours of grey daylight and sombre twilight, and he utilised them in\r\nchopping an enormous supply of fire-wood.\r\n\r\nWith night came horror. Not only were the starving wolves growing\r\nbolder, but lack of sleep was telling upon Henry. He dozed despite\r\nhimself, crouching by the fire, the blankets about his shoulders, the\r\naxe between his knees, and on either side a dog pressing close against\r\nhim. He awoke once and saw in front of him, not a dozen feet away, a\r\nbig grey wolf, one of the largest of the pack. And even as he looked,\r\nthe brute deliberately stretched himself after the manner of a lazy\r\ndog, yawning full in his face and looking upon him with a possessive\r\neye, as if, in truth, he were merely a delayed meal that was soon to be\r\neaten.\r\n\r\nThis certitude was shown by the whole pack. Fully a score he could\r\ncount, staring hungrily at him or calmly sleeping in the snow. They\r\nreminded him of children gathered about a spread table and awaiting\r\npermission to begin to eat. And he was the food they were to eat! He\r\nwondered how and when the meal would begin.\r\n\r\nAs he piled wood on the fire he discovered an appreciation of his own\r\nbody which he had never felt before. He watched his moving muscles and\r\nwas interested in the cunning mechanism of his fingers. By the light of\r\nthe fire he crooked his fingers slowly and repeatedly now one at a\r\ntime, now all together, spreading them wide or making quick gripping\r\nmovements. He studied the nail-formation, and prodded the finger-tips,\r\nnow sharply, and again softly, gauging the while the nerve-sensations\r\nproduced. It fascinated him, and he grew suddenly fond of this subtle\r\nflesh of his that worked so beautifully and smoothly and delicately.\r\nThen he would cast a glance of fear at the wolf-circle drawn\r\nexpectantly about him, and like a blow the realisation would strike him\r\nthat this wonderful body of his, this living flesh, was no more than so\r\nmuch meat, a quest of ravenous animals, to be torn and slashed by their\r\nhungry fangs, to be sustenance to them as the moose and the rabbit had\r\noften been sustenance to him.\r\n\r\nHe came out of a doze that was half nightmare, to see the red-hued\r\nshe-wolf before him. She was not more than half a dozen feet away\r\nsitting in the snow and wistfully regarding him. The two dogs were\r\nwhimpering and snarling at his feet, but she took no notice of them.\r\nShe was looking at the man, and for some time he returned her look.\r\nThere was nothing threatening about her. She looked at him merely with\r\na great wistfulness, but he knew it to be the wistfulness of an equally\r\ngreat hunger. He was the food, and the sight of him excited in her the\r\ngustatory sensations. Her mouth opened, the saliva drooled forth, and\r\nshe licked her chops with the pleasure of anticipation.\r\n\r\nA spasm of fear went through him. He reached hastily for a brand to\r\nthrow at her. But even as he reached, and before his fingers had closed\r\non the missile, she sprang back into safety; and he knew that she was\r\nused to having things thrown at her. She had snarled as she sprang\r\naway, baring her white fangs to their roots, all her wistfulness\r\nvanishing, being replaced by a carnivorous malignity that made him\r\nshudder. He glanced at the hand that held the brand, noticing the\r\ncunning delicacy of the fingers that gripped it, how they adjusted\r\nthemselves to all the inequalities of the surface, curling over and\r\nunder and about the rough wood, and one little finger, too close to the\r\nburning portion of the brand, sensitively and automatically writhing\r\nback from the hurtful heat to a cooler gripping-place; and in the same\r\ninstant he seemed to see a vision of those same sensitive and delicate\r\nfingers being crushed and torn by the white teeth of the she-wolf.\r\nNever had he been so fond of this body of his as now when his tenure of\r\nit was so precarious.\r\n\r\nAll night, with burning brands, he fought off the hungry pack. When he\r\ndozed despite himself, the whimpering and snarling of the dogs aroused\r\nhim. Morning came, but for the first time the light of day failed to\r\nscatter the wolves. The man waited in vain for them to go. They\r\nremained in a circle about him and his fire, displaying an arrogance of\r\npossession that shook his courage born of the morning light.\r\n\r\nHe made one desperate attempt to pull out on the trail. But the moment\r\nhe left the protection of the fire, the boldest wolf leaped for him,\r\nbut leaped short. He saved himself by springing back, the jaws snapping\r\ntogether a scant six inches from his thigh. The rest of the pack was\r\nnow up and surging upon him, and a throwing of firebrands right and\r\nleft was necessary to drive them back to a respectful distance.\r\n\r\nEven in the daylight he did not dare leave the fire to chop fresh wood.\r\nTwenty feet away towered a huge dead spruce. He spent half the day\r\nextending his campfire to the tree, at any moment a half dozen burning\r\nfaggots ready at hand to fling at his enemies. Once at the tree, he\r\nstudied the surrounding forest in order to fell the tree in the\r\ndirection of the most firewood.\r\n\r\nThe night was a repetition of the night before, save that the need for\r\nsleep was becoming overpowering. The snarling of his dogs was losing\r\nits efficacy. Besides, they were snarling all the time, and his\r\nbenumbed and drowsy senses no longer took note of changing pitch and\r\nintensity. He awoke with a start. The she-wolf was less than a yard\r\nfrom him. Mechanically, at short range, without letting go of it, he\r\nthrust a brand full into her open and snarling mouth. She sprang away,\r\nyelling with pain, and while he took delight in the smell of burning\r\nflesh and hair, he watched her shaking her head and growling wrathfully\r\na score of feet away.\r\n\r\nBut this time, before he dozed again, he tied a burning pine-knot to\r\nhis right hand. His eyes were closed but few minutes when the burn of\r\nthe flame on his flesh awakened him. For several hours he adhered to\r\nthis programme. Every time he was thus awakened he drove back the\r\nwolves with flying brands, replenished the fire, and rearranged the\r\npine-knot on his hand. All worked well, but there came a time when he\r\nfastened the pine-knot insecurely. As his eyes closed it fell away from\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nHe dreamed. It seemed to him that he was in Fort McGurry. It was warm\r\nand comfortable, and he was playing cribbage with the Factor. Also, it\r\nseemed to him that the fort was besieged by wolves. They were howling\r\nat the very gates, and sometimes he and the Factor paused from the game\r\nto listen and laugh at the futile efforts of the wolves to get in. And\r\nthen, so strange was the dream, there was a crash. The door was burst\r\nopen. He could see the wolves flooding into the big living-room of the\r\nfort. They were leaping straight for him and the Factor. With the\r\nbursting open of the door, the noise of their howling had increased\r\ntremendously. This howling now bothered him. His dream was merging into\r\nsomething else\xe2\x80\x94he knew not what; but through it all, following him,\r\npersisted the howling.\r\n\r\nAnd then he awoke to find the howling real. There was a great snarling\r\nand yelping. The wolves were rushing him. They were all about him and\r\nupon him. The teeth of one had closed upon his arm. Instinctively he\r\nleaped into the fire, and as he leaped, he felt the sharp slash of\r\nteeth that tore through the flesh of his leg. Then began a fire fight.\r\nHis stout mittens temporarily protected his hands, and he scooped live\r\ncoals into the air in all directions, until the campfire took on the\r\nsemblance of a volcano.\r\n\r\nBut it could not last long. His face was blistering in the heat, his\r\neyebrows and lashes were singed off, and the heat was becoming\r\nunbearable to his feet. With a flaming brand in each hand, he sprang to\r\nthe edge of the fire. The wolves had been driven back. On every side,\r\nwherever the live coals had fallen, the snow was sizzling, and every\r\nlittle while a retiring wolf, with wild leap and snort and snarl,\r\nannounced that one such live coal had been stepped upon.\r\n\r\nFlinging his brands at the nearest of his enemies, the man thrust his\r\nsmouldering mittens into the snow and stamped about to cool his feet.\r\nHis two dogs were missing, and he well knew that they had served as a\r\ncourse in the protracted meal which had begun days before with Fatty,\r\nthe last course of which would likely be himself in the days to follow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t got me yet!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, savagely shaking his fist at the\r\nhungry beasts; and at the sound of his voice the whole circle was\r\nagitated, there was a general snarl, and the she-wolf slid up close to\r\nhim across the snow and watched him with hungry wistfulness.\r\n\r\nHe set to work to carry out a new idea that had come to him. He\r\nextended the fire into a large circle. Inside this circle he crouched,\r\nhis sleeping outfit under him as a protection against the melting snow.\r\nWhen he had thus disappeared within his shelter of flame, the whole\r\npack came curiously to the rim of the fire to see what had become of\r\nhim. Hitherto they had been denied access to the fire, and they now\r\nsettled down in a close-drawn circle, like so many dogs, blinking and\r\nyawning and stretching their lean bodies in the unaccustomed warmth.\r\nThen the she-wolf sat down, pointed her nose at a star, and began to\r\nhowl. One by one the wolves joined her, till the whole pack, on\r\nhaunches, with noses pointed skyward, was howling its hunger cry.\r\n\r\nDawn came, and daylight. The fire was burning low. The fuel had run\r\nout, and there was need to get more. The man attempted to step out of\r\nhis circle of flame, but the wolves surged to meet him. Burning brands\r\nmade them spring aside, but they no longer sprang back. In vain he\r\nstrove to drive them back. As he gave up and stumbled inside his\r\ncircle, a wolf leaped for him, missed, and landed with all four feet in\r\nthe coals. It cried out with terror, at the same time snarling, and\r\nscrambled back to cool its paws in the snow.\r\n\r\nThe man sat down on his blankets in a crouching position. His body\r\nleaned forward from the hips. His shoulders, relaxed and drooping, and\r\nhis head on his knees advertised that he had given up the struggle. Now\r\nand again he raised his head to note the dying down of the fire. The\r\ncircle of flame and coals was breaking into segments with openings in\r\nbetween. These openings grew in size, the segments diminished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you can come an\xe2\x80\x99 get me any time,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce he awakened, and in an opening in the circle, directly in front of\r\nhim, he saw the she-wolf gazing at him.\r\n\r\nAgain he awakened, a little later, though it seemed hours to him. A\r\nmysterious change had taken place\xe2\x80\x94so mysterious a change that he was\r\nshocked wider awake. Something had happened. He could not understand at\r\nfirst. Then he discovered it. The wolves were gone. Remained only the\r\ntrampled snow to show how closely they had pressed him. Sleep was\r\nwelling up and gripping him again, his head was sinking down upon his\r\nknees, when he roused with a sudden start.\r\n\r\nThere were cries of men, and churn of sleds, the creaking of harnesses,\r\nand the eager whimpering of straining dogs. Four sleds pulled in from\r\nthe river bed to the camp among the trees. Half a dozen men were about\r\nthe man who crouched in the centre of the dying fire. They were shaking\r\nand prodding him into consciousness. He looked at them like a drunken\r\nman and maundered in strange, sleepy speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRed she-wolf. . . . Come in with the dogs at feedin\xe2\x80\x99 time. . . . First\r\nshe ate the dog-food. . . . Then she ate the dogs. . . . An\xe2\x80\x99 after that\r\nshe ate Bill. . . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Lord Alfred?\xe2\x80\x9d one of the men bellowed in his ear, shaking him\r\nroughly.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat him. . . . He\xe2\x80\x99s roostin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin a tree at the last camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d the man shouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 in a box,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry answered. He jerked his shoulder petulantly away\r\nfrom the grip of his questioner. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, you lemme alone. . . . I\xe2\x80\x99m jes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nplump tuckered out. . . . Goo\xe2\x80\x99 night, everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes fluttered and went shut. His chin fell forward on his chest.\r\nAnd even as they eased him down upon the blankets his snores were\r\nrising on the frosty air.\r\n\r\nBut there was another sound. Far and faint it was, in the remote\r\ndistance, the cry of the hungry wolf-pack as it took the trail of other\r\nmeat than the man it had just missed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE FANGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the she-wolf who had first caught the sound of men\xe2\x80\x99s voices and\r\nthe whining of the sled-dogs; and it was the she-wolf who was first to\r\nspring away from the cornered man in his circle of dying flame. The\r\npack had been loath to forego the kill it had hunted down, and it\r\nlingered for several minutes, making sure of the sounds, and then it,\r\ntoo, sprang away on the trail made by the she-wolf.\r\n\r\nRunning at the forefront of the pack was a large grey wolf\xe2\x80\x94one of its\r\nseveral leaders. It was he who directed the pack\xe2\x80\x99s course on the heels\r\nof the she-wolf. It was he who snarled warningly at the younger members\r\nof the pack or slashed at them with his fangs when they ambitiously\r\ntried to pass him. And it was he who increased the pace when he sighted\r\nthe she-wolf, now trotting slowly across the snow.\r\n\r\nShe dropped in alongside by him, as though it were her appointed\r\nposition, and took the pace of the pack. He did not snarl at her, nor\r\nshow his teeth, when any leap of hers chanced to put her in advance of\r\nhim. On the contrary, he seemed kindly disposed toward her\xe2\x80\x94too kindly\r\nto suit her, for he was prone to run near to her, and when he ran too\r\nnear it was she who snarled and showed her teeth. Nor was she above\r\nslashing his shoulder sharply on occasion. At such times he betrayed no\r\nanger. He merely sprang to the side and ran stiffly ahead for several\r\nawkward leaps, in carriage and conduct resembling an abashed country\r\nswain.\r\n\r\nThis was his one trouble in the running of the pack; but she had other\r\ntroubles. On her other side ran a gaunt old wolf, grizzled and marked\r\nwith the scars of many battles. He ran always on her right side. The\r\nfact that he had but one eye, and that the left eye, might account for\r\nthis. He, also, was addicted to crowding her, to veering toward her\r\ntill his scarred muzzle touched her body, or shoulder, or neck. As with\r\nthe running mate on the left, she repelled these attentions with her\r\nteeth; but when both bestowed their attentions at the same time she was\r\nroughly jostled, being compelled, with quick snaps to either side, to\r\ndrive both lovers away and at the same time to maintain her forward\r\nleap with the pack and see the way of her feet before her. At such\r\ntimes her running mates flashed their teeth and growled threateningly\r\nacross at each other. They might have fought, but even wooing and its\r\nrivalry waited upon the more pressing hunger-need of the pack.\r\n\r\nAfter each repulse, when the old wolf sheered abruptly away from the\r\nsharp-toothed object of his desire, he shouldered against a young\r\nthree-year-old that ran on his blind right side. This young wolf had\r\nattained his full size; and, considering the weak and famished\r\ncondition of the pack, he possessed more than the average vigour and\r\nspirit. Nevertheless, he ran with his head even with the shoulder of\r\nhis one-eyed elder. When he ventured to run abreast of the older wolf\r\n(which was seldom), a snarl and a snap sent him back even with the\r\nshoulder again. Sometimes, however, he dropped cautiously and slowly\r\nbehind and edged in between the old leader and the she-wolf. This was\r\ndoubly resented, even triply resented. When she snarled her\r\ndispleasure, the old leader would whirl on the three-year-old.\r\nSometimes she whirled with him. And sometimes the young leader on the\r\nleft whirled, too.\r\n\r\nAt such times, confronted by three sets of savage teeth, the young wolf\r\nstopped precipitately, throwing himself back on his haunches, with\r\nfore-legs stiff, mouth menacing, and mane bristling. This confusion in\r\nthe front of the moving pack always caused confusion in the rear. The\r\nwolves behind collided with the young wolf and expressed their\r\ndispleasure by administering sharp nips on his hind-legs and flanks. He\r\nwas laying up trouble for himself, for lack of food and short tempers\r\nwent together; but with the boundless faith of youth he persisted in\r\nrepeating the manoeuvre every little while, though it never succeeded\r\nin gaining anything for him but discomfiture.\r\n\r\nHad there been food, love-making and fighting would have gone on apace,\r\nand the pack-formation would have been broken up. But the situation of\r\nthe pack was desperate. It was lean with long-standing hunger. It ran\r\nbelow its ordinary speed. At the rear limped the weak members, the very\r\nyoung and the very old. At the front were the strongest. Yet all were\r\nmore like skeletons than full-bodied wolves. Nevertheless, with the\r\nexception of the ones that limped, the movements of the animals were\r\neffortless and tireless. Their stringy muscles seemed founts of\r\ninexhaustible energy. Behind every steel-like contraction of a muscle,\r\nlay another steel-like contraction, and another, and another,\r\napparently without end.\r\n\r\nThey ran many miles that day. They ran through the night. And the next\r\nday found them still running. They were running over the surface of a\r\nworld frozen and dead. No life stirred. They alone moved through the\r\nvast inertness. They alone were alive, and they sought for other things\r\nthat were alive in order that they might devour them and continue to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThey crossed low divides and ranged a dozen small streams in a\r\nlower-lying country before their quest was rewarded. Then they came\r\nupon moose. It was a big bull they first found. Here was meat and life,\r\nand it was guarded by no mysterious fires nor flying missiles of flame.\r\nSplay hoofs and palmated antlers they knew, and they flung their\r\ncustomary patience and caution to the wind. It was a brief fight and\r\nfierce. The big bull was beset on every side. He ripped them open or\r\nsplit their skulls with shrewdly driven blows of his great hoofs. He\r\ncrushed them and broke them on his large horns. He stamped them into\r\nthe snow under him in the wallowing struggle. But he was foredoomed,\r\nand he went down with the she-wolf tearing savagely at his throat, and\r\nwith other teeth fixed everywhere upon him, devouring him alive, before\r\never his last struggles ceased or his last damage had been wrought.\r\n\r\nThere was food in plenty. The bull weighed over eight hundred\r\npounds\xe2\x80\x94fully twenty pounds of meat per mouth for the forty-odd wolves\r\nof the pack. But if they could fast prodigiously, they could feed\r\nprodigiously, and soon a few scattered bones were all that remained of\r\nthe splendid live brute that had faced the pack a few hours before.\r\n\r\nThere was now much resting and sleeping. With full stomachs, bickering\r\nand quarrelling began among the younger males, and this continued\r\nthrough the few days that followed before the breaking-up of the pack.\r\nThe famine was over. The wolves were now in the country of game, and\r\nthough they still hunted in pack, they hunted more cautiously, cutting\r\nout heavy cows or crippled old bulls from the small moose-herds they\r\nran across.\r\n\r\nThere came a day, in this land of plenty, when the wolf-pack split in\r\nhalf and went in different directions. The she-wolf, the young leader\r\non her left, and the one-eyed elder on her right, led their half of the\r\npack down to the Mackenzie River and across into the lake country to\r\nthe east. Each day this remnant of the pack dwindled. Two by two, male\r\nand female, the wolves were deserting. Occasionally a solitary male was\r\ndriven out by the sharp teeth of his rivals. In the end there remained\r\nonly four: the she-wolf, the young leader, the one-eyed one, and the\r\nambitious three-year-old.\r\n\r\nThe she-wolf had by now developed a ferocious temper. Her three suitors\r\nall bore the marks of her teeth. Yet they never replied in kind, never\r\ndefended themselves against her. They turned their shoulders to her\r\nmost savage slashes, and with wagging tails and mincing steps strove to\r\nplacate her wrath. But if they were all mildness toward her, they were\r\nall fierceness toward one another. The three-year-old grew too\r\nambitious in his fierceness. He caught the one-eyed elder on his blind\r\nside and ripped his ear into ribbons. Though the grizzled old fellow\r\ncould see only on one side, against the youth and vigour of the other\r\nhe brought into play the wisdom of long years of experience. His lost\r\neye and his scarred muzzle bore evidence to the nature of his\r\nexperience. He had survived too many battles to be in doubt for a\r\nmoment about what to do.\r\n\r\nThe battle began fairly, but it did not end fairly. There was no\r\ntelling what the outcome would have been, for the third wolf joined the\r\nelder, and together, old leader and young leader, they attacked the\r\nambitious three-year-old and proceeded to destroy him. He was beset on\r\neither side by the merciless fangs of his erstwhile comrades. Forgotten\r\nwere the days they had hunted together, the game they had pulled down,\r\nthe famine they had suffered. That business was a thing of the past.\r\nThe business of love was at hand\xe2\x80\x94ever a sterner and crueller business\r\nthan that of food-getting.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meanwhile, the she-wolf, the cause of it all, sat down\r\ncontentedly on her haunches and watched. She was even pleased. This was\r\nher day\xe2\x80\x94and it came not often\xe2\x80\x94when manes bristled, and fang smote fang\r\nor ripped and tore the yielding flesh, all for the possession of her.\r\n\r\nAnd in the business of love the three-year-old, who had made this his\r\nfirst adventure upon it, yielded up his life. On either side of his\r\nbody stood his two rivals. They were gazing at the she-wolf, who sat\r\nsmiling in the snow. But the elder leader was wise, very wise, in love\r\neven as in battle. The younger leader turned his head to lick a wound\r\non his shoulder. The curve of his neck was turned toward his rival.\r\nWith his one eye the elder saw the opportunity. He darted in low and\r\nclosed with his fangs. It was a long, ripping slash, and deep as well.\r\nHis teeth, in passing, burst the wall of the great vein of the throat.\r\nThen he leaped clear.\r\n\r\nThe young leader snarled terribly, but his snarl broke midmost into a\r\ntickling cough. Bleeding and coughing, already stricken, he sprang at\r\nthe elder and fought while life faded from him, his legs going weak\r\nbeneath him, the light of day dulling on his eyes, his blows and\r\nsprings falling shorter and shorter.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while the she-wolf sat on her haunches and smiled. She was\r\nmade glad in vague ways by the battle, for this was the love-making of\r\nthe Wild, the sex-tragedy of the natural world that was tragedy only to\r\nthose that died. To those that survived it was not tragedy, but\r\nrealisation and achievement.\r\n\r\nWhen the young leader lay in the snow and moved no more, One Eye\r\nstalked over to the she-wolf. His carriage was one of mingled triumph\r\nand caution. He was plainly expectant of a rebuff, and he was just as\r\nplainly surprised when her teeth did not flash out at him in anger. For\r\nthe first time she met him with a kindly manner. She sniffed noses with\r\nhim, and even condescended to leap about and frisk and play with him in\r\nquite puppyish fashion. And he, for all his grey years and sage\r\nexperience, behaved quite as puppyishly and even a little more\r\nfoolishly.\r\n\r\nForgotten already were the vanquished rivals and the love-tale\r\nred-written on the snow. Forgotten, save once, when old One Eye stopped\r\nfor a moment to lick his stiffening wounds. Then it was that his lips\r\nhalf writhed into a snarl, and the hair of his neck and shoulders\r\ninvoluntarily bristled, while he half crouched for a spring, his claws\r\nspasmodically clutching into the snow-surface for firmer footing. But\r\nit was all forgotten the next moment, as he sprang after the she-wolf,\r\nwho was coyly leading him a chase through the woods.\r\n\r\nAfter that they ran side by side, like good friends who have come to an\r\nunderstanding. The days passed by, and they kept together, hunting\r\ntheir meat and killing and eating it in common. After a time the\r\nshe-wolf began to grow restless. She seemed to be searching for\r\nsomething that she could not find. The hollows under fallen trees\r\nseemed to attract her, and she spent much time nosing about among the\r\nlarger snow-piled crevices in the rocks and in the caves of overhanging\r\nbanks. Old One Eye was not interested at all, but he followed her\r\ngood-naturedly in her quest, and when her investigations in particular\r\nplaces were unusually protracted, he would lie down and wait until she\r\nwas ready to go on.\r\n\r\nThey did not remain in one place, but travelled across country until\r\nthey regained the Mackenzie River, down which they slowly went, leaving\r\nit often to hunt game along the small streams that entered it, but\r\nalways returning to it again. Sometimes they chanced upon other wolves,\r\nusually in pairs; but there was no friendliness of intercourse\r\ndisplayed on either side, no gladness at meeting, no desire to return\r\nto the pack-formation. Several times they encountered solitary wolves.\r\nThese were always males, and they were pressingly insistent on joining\r\nwith One Eye and his mate. This he resented, and when she stood\r\nshoulder to shoulder with him, bristling and showing her teeth, the\r\naspiring solitary ones would back off, turn-tail, and continue on their\r\nlonely way.\r\n\r\nOne moonlight night, running through the quiet forest, One Eye suddenly\r\nhalted. His muzzle went up, his tail stiffened, and his nostrils\r\ndilated as he scented the air. One foot also he held up, after the\r\nmanner of a dog. He was not satisfied, and he continued to smell the\r\nair, striving to understand the message borne upon it to him. One\r\ncareless sniff had satisfied his mate, and she trotted on to reassure\r\nhim. Though he followed her, he was still dubious, and he could not\r\nforbear an occasional halt in order more carefully to study the\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nShe crept out cautiously on the edge of a large open space in the midst\r\nof the trees. For some time she stood alone. Then One Eye, creeping and\r\ncrawling, every sense on the alert, every hair radiating infinite\r\nsuspicion, joined her. They stood side by side, watching and listening\r\nand smelling.\r\n\r\nTo their ears came the sounds of dogs wrangling and scuffling, the\r\nguttural cries of men, the sharper voices of scolding women, and once\r\nthe shrill and plaintive cry of a child. With the exception of the huge\r\nbulks of the skin-lodges, little could be seen save the flames of the\r\nfire, broken by the movements of intervening bodies, and the smoke\r\nrising slowly on the quiet air. But to their nostrils came the myriad\r\nsmells of an Indian camp, carrying a story that was largely\r\nincomprehensible to One Eye, but every detail of which the she-wolf\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nShe was strangely stirred, and sniffed and sniffed with an increasing\r\ndelight. But old One Eye was doubtful. He betrayed his apprehension,\r\nand started tentatively to go. She turned and touched his neck with her\r\nmuzzle in a reassuring way, then regarded the camp again. A new\r\nwistfulness was in her face, but it was not the wistfulness of hunger.\r\nShe was thrilling to a desire that urged her to go forward, to be in\r\ncloser to that fire, to be squabbling with the dogs, and to be avoiding\r\nand dodging the stumbling feet of men.\r\n\r\nOne Eye moved impatiently beside her; her unrest came back upon her,\r\nand she knew again her pressing need to find the thing for which she\r\nsearched. She turned and trotted back into the forest, to the great\r\nrelief of One Eye, who trotted a little to the fore until they were\r\nwell within the shelter of the trees.\r\n\r\nAs they slid along, noiseless as shadows, in the moonlight, they came\r\nupon a run-way. Both noses went down to the footprints in the snow.\r\nThese footprints were very fresh. One Eye ran ahead cautiously, his\r\nmate at his heels. The broad pads of their feet were spread wide and in\r\ncontact with the snow were like velvet. One Eye caught sight of a dim\r\nmovement of white in the midst of the white. His sliding gait had been\r\ndeceptively swift, but it was as nothing to the speed at which he now\r\nran. Before him was bounding the faint patch of white he had\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThey were running along a narrow alley flanked on either side by a\r\ngrowth of young spruce. Through the trees the mouth of the alley could\r\nbe seen, opening out on a moonlit glade. Old One Eye was rapidly\r\noverhauling the fleeing shape of white. Bound by bound he gained. Now\r\nhe was upon it. One leap more and his teeth would be sinking into it.\r\nBut that leap was never made. High in the air, and straight up, soared\r\nthe shape of white, now a struggling snowshoe rabbit that leaped and\r\nbounded, executing a fantastic dance there above him in the air and\r\nnever once returning to earth.\r\n\r\nOne Eye sprang back with a snort of sudden fright, then shrank down to\r\nthe snow and crouched, snarling threats at this thing of fear he did\r\nnot understand. But the she-wolf coolly thrust past him. She poised for\r\na moment, then sprang for the dancing rabbit. She, too, soared high,\r\nbut not so high as the quarry, and her teeth clipped emptily together\r\nwith a metallic snap. She made another leap, and another.\r\n\r\nHer mate had slowly relaxed from his crouch and was watching her. He\r\nnow evinced displeasure at her repeated failures, and himself made a\r\nmighty spring upward. His teeth closed upon the rabbit, and he bore it\r\nback to earth with him. But at the same time there was a suspicious\r\ncrackling movement beside him, and his astonished eye saw a young\r\nspruce sapling bending down above him to strike him. His jaws let go\r\ntheir grip, and he leaped backward to escape this strange danger, his\r\nlips drawn back from his fangs, his throat snarling, every hair\r\nbristling with rage and fright. And in that moment the sapling reared\r\nits slender length upright and the rabbit soared dancing in the air\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe she-wolf was angry. She sank her fangs into her mate\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder in\r\nreproof; and he, frightened, unaware of what constituted this new\r\nonslaught, struck back ferociously and in still greater fright, ripping\r\ndown the side of the she-wolf\xe2\x80\x99s muzzle. For him to resent such reproof\r\nwas equally unexpected to her, and she sprang upon him in snarling\r\nindignation. Then he discovered his mistake and tried to placate her.\r\nBut she proceeded to punish him roundly, until he gave over all\r\nattempts at placation, and whirled in a circle, his head away from her,\r\nhis shoulders receiving the punishment of her teeth.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the rabbit danced above them in the air. The she-wolf\r\nsat down in the snow, and old One Eye, now more in fear of his mate\r\nthan of the mysterious sapling, again sprang for the rabbit. As he sank\r\nback with it between his teeth, he kept his eye on the sapling. As\r\nbefore, it followed him back to earth. He crouched down under the\r\nimpending blow, his hair bristling, but his teeth still keeping tight\r\nhold of the rabbit. But the blow did not fall. The sapling remained\r\nbent above him. When he moved it moved, and he growled at it through\r\nhis clenched jaws; when he remained still, it remained still, and he\r\nconcluded it was safer to continue remaining still. Yet the warm blood\r\nof the rabbit tasted good in his mouth.\r\n\r\nIt was his mate who relieved him from the quandary in which he found\r\nhimself. She took the rabbit from him, and while the sapling swayed and\r\nteetered threateningly above her she calmly gnawed off the rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead. At once the sapling shot up, and after that gave no more trouble,\r\nremaining in the decorous and perpendicular position in which nature\r\nhad intended it to grow. Then, between them, the she-wolf and One Eye\r\ndevoured the game which the mysterious sapling had caught for them.\r\n\r\nThere were other run-ways and alleys where rabbits were hanging in the\r\nair, and the wolf-pair prospected them all, the she-wolf leading the\r\nway, old One Eye following and observant, learning the method of\r\nrobbing snares\xe2\x80\x94a knowledge destined to stand him in good stead in the\r\ndays to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE LAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two days the she-wolf and One Eye hung about the Indian camp. He\r\nwas worried and apprehensive, yet the camp lured his mate and she was\r\nloath to depart. But when, one morning, the air was rent with the\r\nreport of a rifle close at hand, and a bullet smashed against a tree\r\ntrunk several inches from One Eye\xe2\x80\x99s head, they hesitated no more, but\r\nwent off on a long, swinging lope that put quick miles between them and\r\nthe danger.\r\n\r\nThey did not go far\xe2\x80\x94a couple of days\xe2\x80\x99 journey. The she-wolf\xe2\x80\x99s need to\r\nfind the thing for which she searched had now become imperative. She\r\nwas getting very heavy, and could run but slowly. Once, in the pursuit\r\nof a rabbit, which she ordinarily would have caught with ease, she gave\r\nover and lay down and rested. One Eye came to her; but when he touched\r\nher neck gently with his muzzle she snapped at him with such quick\r\nfierceness that he tumbled over backward and cut a ridiculous figure in\r\nhis effort to escape her teeth. Her temper was now shorter than ever;\r\nbut he had become more patient than ever and more solicitous.\r\n\r\nAnd then she found the thing for which she sought. It was a few miles\r\nup a small stream that in the summer time flowed into the Mackenzie,\r\nbut that then was frozen over and frozen down to its rocky bottom\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndead stream of solid white from source to mouth. The she-wolf was\r\ntrotting wearily along, her mate well in advance, when she came upon\r\nthe overhanging, high clay-bank. She turned aside and trotted over to\r\nit. The wear and tear of spring storms and melting snows had\r\nunderwashed the bank and in one place had made a small cave out of a\r\nnarrow fissure.\r\n\r\nShe paused at the mouth of the cave and looked the wall over carefully.\r\nThen, on one side and the other, she ran along the base of the wall to\r\nwhere its abrupt bulk merged from the softer-lined landscape. Returning\r\nto the cave, she entered its narrow mouth. For a short three feet she\r\nwas compelled to crouch, then the walls widened and rose higher in a\r\nlittle round chamber nearly six feet in diameter. The roof barely\r\ncleared her head. It was dry and cosey. She inspected it with\r\npainstaking care, while One Eye, who had returned, stood in the\r\nentrance and patiently watched her. She dropped her head, with her nose\r\nto the ground and directed toward a point near to her closely bunched\r\nfeet, and around this point she circled several times; then, with a\r\ntired sigh that was almost a grunt, she curled her body in, relaxed her\r\nlegs, and dropped down, her head toward the entrance. One Eye, with\r\npointed, interested ears, laughed at her, and beyond, outlined against\r\nthe white light, she could see the brush of his tail waving\r\ngood-naturedly. Her own ears, with a snuggling movement, laid their\r\nsharp points backward and down against the head for a moment, while her\r\nmouth opened and her tongue lolled peaceably out, and in this way she\r\nexpressed that she was pleased and satisfied.\r\n\r\nOne Eye was hungry. Though he lay down in the entrance and slept, his\r\nsleep was fitful. He kept awaking and cocking his ears at the bright\r\nworld without, where the April sun was blazing across the snow. When he\r\ndozed, upon his ears would steal the faint whispers of hidden trickles\r\nof running water, and he would rouse and listen intently. The sun had\r\ncome back, and all the awakening Northland world was calling to him.\r\nLife was stirring. The feel of spring was in the air, the feel of\r\ngrowing life under the snow, of sap ascending in the trees, of buds\r\nbursting the shackles of the frost.\r\n\r\nHe cast anxious glances at his mate, but she showed no desire to get\r\nup. He looked outside, and half a dozen snow-birds fluttered across his\r\nfield of vision. He started to get up, then looked back to his mate\r\nagain, and settled down and dozed. A shrill and minute singing stole\r\nupon his hearing. Once, and twice, he sleepily brushed his nose with\r\nhis paw. Then he woke up. There, buzzing in the air at the tip of his\r\nnose, was a lone mosquito. It was a full-grown mosquito, one that had\r\nlain frozen in a dry log all winter and that had now been thawed out by\r\nthe sun. He could resist the call of the world no longer. Besides, he\r\nwas hungry.\r\n\r\nHe crawled over to his mate and tried to persuade her to get up. But\r\nshe only snarled at him, and he walked out alone into the bright\r\nsunshine to find the snow-surface soft under foot and the travelling\r\ndifficult. He went up the frozen bed of the stream, where the snow,\r\nshaded by the trees, was yet hard and crystalline. He was gone eight\r\nhours, and he came back through the darkness hungrier than when he had\r\nstarted. He had found game, but he had not caught it. He had broken\r\nthrough the melting snow crust, and wallowed, while the snowshoe\r\nrabbits had skimmed along on top lightly as ever.\r\n\r\nHe paused at the mouth of the cave with a sudden shock of suspicion.\r\nFaint, strange sounds came from within. They were sounds not made by\r\nhis mate, and yet they were remotely familiar. He bellied cautiously\r\ninside and was met by a warning snarl from the she-wolf. This he\r\nreceived without perturbation, though he obeyed it by keeping his\r\ndistance; but he remained interested in the other sounds\xe2\x80\x94faint, muffled\r\nsobbings and slubberings.\r\n\r\nHis mate warned him irritably away, and he curled up and slept in the\r\nentrance. When morning came and a dim light pervaded the lair, he again\r\nsought after the source of the remotely familiar sounds. There was a\r\nnew note in his mate\xe2\x80\x99s warning snarl. It was a jealous note, and he was\r\nvery careful in keeping a respectful distance. Nevertheless, he made\r\nout, sheltering between her legs against the length of her body, five\r\nstrange little bundles of life, very feeble, very helpless, making tiny\r\nwhimpering noises, with eyes that did not open to the light. He was\r\nsurprised. It was not the first time in his long and successful life\r\nthat this thing had happened. It had happened many times, yet each time\r\nit was as fresh a surprise as ever to him.\r\n\r\nHis mate looked at him anxiously. Every little while she emitted a low\r\ngrowl, and at times, when it seemed to her he approached too near, the\r\ngrowl shot up in her throat to a sharp snarl. Of her own experience she\r\nhad no memory of the thing happening; but in her instinct, which was\r\nthe experience of all the mothers of wolves, there lurked a memory of\r\nfathers that had eaten their new-born and helpless progeny. It\r\nmanifested itself as a fear strong within her, that made her prevent\r\nOne Eye from more closely inspecting the cubs he had fathered.\r\n\r\nBut there was no danger. Old One Eye was feeling the urge of an\r\nimpulse, that was, in turn, an instinct that had come down to him from\r\nall the fathers of wolves. He did not question it, nor puzzle over it.\r\nIt was there, in the fibre of his being; and it was the most natural\r\nthing in the world that he should obey it by turning his back on his\r\nnew-born family and by trotting out and away on the meat-trail whereby\r\nhe lived.\r\n\r\nFive or six miles from the lair, the stream divided, its forks going\r\noff among the mountains at a right angle. Here, leading up the left\r\nfork, he came upon a fresh track. He smelled it and found it so recent\r\nthat he crouched swiftly, and looked in the direction in which it\r\ndisappeared. Then he turned deliberately and took the right fork. The\r\nfootprint was much larger than the one his own feet made, and he knew\r\nthat in the wake of such a trail there was little meat for him.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile up the right fork, his quick ears caught the sound of\r\ngnawing teeth. He stalked the quarry and found it to be a porcupine,\r\nstanding upright against a tree and trying his teeth on the bark. One\r\nEye approached carefully but hopelessly. He knew the breed, though he\r\nhad never met it so far north before; and never in his long life had\r\nporcupine served him for a meal. But he had long since learned that\r\nthere was such a thing as Chance, or Opportunity, and he continued to\r\ndraw near. There was never any telling what might happen, for with live\r\nthings events were somehow always happening differently.\r\n\r\nThe porcupine rolled itself into a ball, radiating long, sharp needles\r\nin all directions that defied attack. In his youth One Eye had once\r\nsniffed too near a similar, apparently inert ball of quills, and had\r\nthe tail flick out suddenly in his face. One quill he had carried away\r\nin his muzzle, where it had remained for weeks, a rankling flame, until\r\nit finally worked out. So he lay down, in a comfortable crouching\r\nposition, his nose fully a foot away, and out of the line of the tail.\r\nThus he waited, keeping perfectly quiet. There was no telling.\r\nSomething might happen. The porcupine might unroll. There might be\r\nopportunity for a deft and ripping thrust of paw into the tender,\r\nunguarded belly.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of half an hour he arose, growled wrathfully at the\r\nmotionless ball, and trotted on. He had waited too often and futilely\r\nin the past for porcupines to unroll, to waste any more time. He\r\ncontinued up the right fork. The day wore along, and nothing rewarded\r\nhis hunt.\r\n\r\nThe urge of his awakened instinct of fatherhood was strong upon him. He\r\nmust find meat. In the afternoon he blundered upon a ptarmigan. He came\r\nout of a thicket and found himself face to face with the slow-witted\r\nbird. It was sitting on a log, not a foot beyond the end of his nose.\r\nEach saw the other. The bird made a startled rise, but he struck it\r\nwith his paw, and smashed it down to earth, then pounced upon it, and\r\ncaught it in his teeth as it scuttled across the snow trying to rise in\r\nthe air again. As his teeth crunched through the tender flesh and\r\nfragile bones, he began naturally to eat. Then he remembered, and,\r\nturning on the back-track, started for home, carrying the ptarmigan in\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\nA mile above the forks, running velvet-footed as was his custom, a\r\ngliding shadow that cautiously prospected each new vista of the trail,\r\nhe came upon later imprints of the large tracks he had discovered in\r\nthe early morning. As the track led his way, he followed, prepared to\r\nmeet the maker of it at every turn of the stream.\r\n\r\nHe slid his head around a corner of rock, where began an unusually\r\nlarge bend in the stream, and his quick eyes made out something that\r\nsent him crouching swiftly down. It was the maker of the track, a large\r\nfemale lynx. She was crouching as he had crouched once that day, in\r\nfront of her the tight-rolled ball of quills. If he had been a gliding\r\nshadow before, he now became the ghost of such a shadow, as he crept\r\nand circled around, and came up well to leeward of the silent,\r\nmotionless pair.\r\n\r\nHe lay down in the snow, depositing the ptarmigan beside him, and with\r\neyes peering through the needles of a low-growing spruce he watched the\r\nplay of life before him\xe2\x80\x94the waiting lynx and the waiting porcupine,\r\neach intent on life; and, such was the curiousness of the game, the way\r\nof life for one lay in the eating of the other, and the way of life for\r\nthe other lay in being not eaten. While old One Eye, the wolf crouching\r\nin the covert, played his part, too, in the game, waiting for some\r\nstrange freak of Chance, that might help him on the meat-trail which\r\nwas his way of life.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed, an hour; and nothing happened. The ball of quills\r\nmight have been a stone for all it moved; the lynx might have been\r\nfrozen to marble; and old One Eye might have been dead. Yet all three\r\nanimals were keyed to a tenseness of living that was almost painful,\r\nand scarcely ever would it come to them to be more alive than they were\r\nthen in their seeming petrifaction.\r\n\r\nOne Eye moved slightly and peered forth with increased eagerness.\r\nSomething was happening. The porcupine had at last decided that its\r\nenemy had gone away. Slowly, cautiously, it was unrolling its ball of\r\nimpregnable armour. It was agitated by no tremor of anticipation.\r\nSlowly, slowly, the bristling ball straightened out and lengthened. One\r\nEye watching, felt a sudden moistness in his mouth and a drooling of\r\nsaliva, involuntary, excited by the living meat that was spreading\r\nitself like a repast before him.\r\n\r\nNot quite entirely had the porcupine unrolled when it discovered its\r\nenemy. In that instant the lynx struck. The blow was like a flash of\r\nlight. The paw, with rigid claws curving like talons, shot under the\r\ntender belly and came back with a swift ripping movement. Had the\r\nporcupine been entirely unrolled, or had it not discovered its enemy a\r\nfraction of a second before the blow was struck, the paw would have\r\nescaped unscathed; but a side-flick of the tail sank sharp quills into\r\nit as it was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nEverything had happened at once\xe2\x80\x94the blow, the counter-blow, the squeal\r\nof agony from the porcupine, the big cat\xe2\x80\x99s squall of sudden hurt and\r\nastonishment. One Eye half arose in his excitement, his ears up, his\r\ntail straight out and quivering behind him. The lynx\xe2\x80\x99s bad temper got\r\nthe best of her. She sprang savagely at the thing that had hurt her.\r\nBut the porcupine, squealing and grunting, with disrupted anatomy\r\ntrying feebly to roll up into its ball-protection, flicked out its tail\r\nagain, and again the big cat squalled with hurt and astonishment. Then\r\nshe fell to backing away and sneezing, her nose bristling with quills\r\nlike a monstrous pin-cushion. She brushed her nose with her paws,\r\ntrying to dislodge the fiery darts, thrust it into the snow, and rubbed\r\nit against twigs and branches, and all the time leaping about, ahead,\r\nsidewise, up and down, in a frenzy of pain and fright.\r\n\r\nShe sneezed continually, and her stub of a tail was doing its best\r\ntoward lashing about by giving quick, violent jerks. She quit her\r\nantics, and quieted down for a long minute. One Eye watched. And even\r\nhe could not repress a start and an involuntary bristling of hair along\r\nhis back when she suddenly leaped, without warning, straight up in the\r\nair, at the same time emitting a long and most terrible squall. Then\r\nshe sprang away, up the trail, squalling with every leap she made.\r\n\r\nIt was not until her racket had faded away in the distance and died out\r\nthat One Eye ventured forth. He walked as delicately as though all the\r\nsnow were carpeted with porcupine quills, erect and ready to pierce the\r\nsoft pads of his feet. The porcupine met his approach with a furious\r\nsquealing and a clashing of its long teeth. It had managed to roll up\r\nin a ball again, but it was not quite the old compact ball; its muscles\r\nwere too much torn for that. It had been ripped almost in half, and was\r\nstill bleeding profusely.\r\n\r\nOne Eye scooped out mouthfuls of the blood-soaked snow, and chewed and\r\ntasted and swallowed. This served as a relish, and his hunger increased\r\nmightily; but he was too old in the world to forget his caution. He\r\nwaited. He lay down and waited, while the porcupine grated its teeth\r\nand uttered grunts and sobs and occasional sharp little squeals. In a\r\nlittle while, One Eye noticed that the quills were drooping and that a\r\ngreat quivering had set up. The quivering came to an end suddenly.\r\nThere was a final defiant clash of the long teeth. Then all the quills\r\ndrooped quite down, and the body relaxed and moved no more.\r\n\r\nWith a nervous, shrinking paw, One Eye stretched out the porcupine to\r\nits full length and turned it over on its back. Nothing had happened.\r\nIt was surely dead. He studied it intently for a moment, then took a\r\ncareful grip with his teeth and started off down the stream, partly\r\ncarrying, partly dragging the porcupine, with head turned to the side\r\nso as to avoid stepping on the prickly mass. He recollected something,\r\ndropped the burden, and trotted back to where he had left the\r\nptarmigan. He did not hesitate a moment. He knew clearly what was to be\r\ndone, and this he did by promptly eating the ptarmigan. Then he\r\nreturned and took up his burden.\r\n\r\nWhen he dragged the result of his day\xe2\x80\x99s hunt into the cave, the\r\nshe-wolf inspected it, turned her muzzle to him, and lightly licked him\r\non the neck. But the next instant she was warning him away from the\r\ncubs with a snarl that was less harsh than usual and that was more\r\napologetic than menacing. Her instinctive fear of the father of her\r\nprogeny was toning down. He was behaving as a wolf-father should, and\r\nmanifesting no unholy desire to devour the young lives she had brought\r\ninto the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE GREY CUB\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was different from his brothers and sisters. Their hair already\r\nbetrayed the reddish hue inherited from their mother, the she-wolf;\r\nwhile he alone, in this particular, took after his father. He was the\r\none little grey cub of the litter. He had bred true to the straight\r\nwolf-stock\xe2\x80\x94in fact, he had bred true to old One Eye himself,\r\nphysically, with but a single exception, and that was he had two eyes\r\nto his father\xe2\x80\x99s one.\r\n\r\nThe grey cub\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had not been open long, yet already he could see\r\nwith steady clearness. And while his eyes were still closed, he had\r\nfelt, tasted, and smelled. He knew his two brothers and his two sisters\r\nvery well. He had begun to romp with them in a feeble, awkward way, and\r\neven to squabble, his little throat vibrating with a queer rasping\r\nnoise (the forerunner of the growl), as he worked himself into a\r\npassion. And long before his eyes had opened he had learned by touch,\r\ntaste, and smell to know his mother\xe2\x80\x94a fount of warmth and liquid food\r\nand tenderness. She possessed a gentle, caressing tongue that soothed\r\nhim when it passed over his soft little body, and that impelled him to\r\nsnuggle close against her and to doze off to sleep.\r\n\r\nMost of the first month of his life had been passed thus in sleeping;\r\nbut now he could see quite well, and he stayed awake for longer periods\r\nof time, and he was coming to learn his world quite well. His world was\r\ngloomy; but he did not know that, for he knew no other world. It was\r\ndim-lighted; but his eyes had never had to adjust themselves to any\r\nother light. His world was very small. Its limits were the walls of the\r\nlair; but as he had no knowledge of the wide world outside, he was\r\nnever oppressed by the narrow confines of his existence.\r\n\r\nBut he had early discovered that one wall of his world was different\r\nfrom the rest. This was the mouth of the cave and the source of light.\r\nHe had discovered that it was different from the other walls long\r\nbefore he had any thoughts of his own, any conscious volitions. It had\r\nbeen an irresistible attraction before ever his eyes opened and looked\r\nupon it. The light from it had beat upon his sealed lids, and the eyes\r\nand the optic nerves had pulsated to little, sparklike flashes,\r\nwarm-coloured and strangely pleasing. The life of his body, and of\r\nevery fibre of his body, the life that was the very substance of his\r\nbody and that was apart from his own personal life, had yearned toward\r\nthis light and urged his body toward it in the same way that the\r\ncunning chemistry of a plant urges it toward the sun.\r\n\r\nAlways, in the beginning, before his conscious life dawned, he had\r\ncrawled toward the mouth of the cave. And in this his brothers and\r\nsisters were one with him. Never, in that period, did any of them crawl\r\ntoward the dark corners of the back-wall. The light drew them as if\r\nthey were plants; the chemistry of the life that composed them demanded\r\nthe light as a necessity of being; and their little puppet-bodies\r\ncrawled blindly and chemically, like the tendrils of a vine. Later on,\r\nwhen each developed individuality and became personally conscious of\r\nimpulsions and desires, the attraction of the light increased. They\r\nwere always crawling and sprawling toward it, and being driven back\r\nfrom it by their mother.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that the grey cub learned other attributes of his\r\nmother than the soft, soothing, tongue. In his insistent crawling\r\ntoward the light, he discovered in her a nose that with a sharp nudge\r\nadministered rebuke, and later, a paw, that crushed him down and rolled\r\nhim over and over with swift, calculating stroke. Thus he learned hurt;\r\nand on top of it he learned to avoid hurt, first, by not incurring the\r\nrisk of it; and second, when he had incurred the risk, by dodging and\r\nby retreating. These were conscious actions, and were the results of\r\nhis first generalisations upon the world. Before that he had recoiled\r\nautomatically from hurt, as he had crawled automatically toward the\r\nlight. After that he recoiled from hurt because he _knew_ that it was\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nHe was a fierce little cub. So were his brothers and sisters. It was to\r\nbe expected. He was a carnivorous animal. He came of a breed of\r\nmeat-killers and meat-eaters. His father and mother lived wholly upon\r\nmeat. The milk he had sucked with his first flickering life, was milk\r\ntransformed directly from meat, and now, at a month old, when his eyes\r\nhad been open for but a week, he was beginning himself to eat meat\xe2\x80\x94meat\r\nhalf-digested by the she-wolf and disgorged for the five growing cubs\r\nthat already made too great demand upon her breast.\r\n\r\nBut he was, further, the fiercest of the litter. He could make a louder\r\nrasping growl than any of them. His tiny rages were much more terrible\r\nthan theirs. It was he that first learned the trick of rolling a\r\nfellow-cub over with a cunning paw-stroke. And it was he that first\r\ngripped another cub by the ear and pulled and tugged and growled\r\nthrough jaws tight-clenched. And certainly it was he that caused the\r\nmother the most trouble in keeping her litter from the mouth of the\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nThe fascination of the light for the grey cub increased from day to\r\nday. He was perpetually departing on yard-long adventures toward the\r\ncave\xe2\x80\x99s entrance, and as perpetually being driven back. Only he did not\r\nknow it for an entrance. He did not know anything about\r\nentrances\xe2\x80\x94passages whereby one goes from one place to another place. He\r\ndid not know any other place, much less of a way to get there. So to\r\nhim the entrance of the cave was a wall\xe2\x80\x94a wall of light. As the sun was\r\nto the outside dweller, this wall was to him the sun of his world. It\r\nattracted him as a candle attracts a moth. He was always striving to\r\nattain it. The life that was so swiftly expanding within him, urged him\r\ncontinually toward the wall of light. The life that was within him knew\r\nthat it was the one way out, the way he was predestined to tread. But\r\nhe himself did not know anything about it. He did not know there was\r\nany outside at all.\r\n\r\nThere was one strange thing about this wall of light. His father (he\r\nhad already come to recognise his father as the one other dweller in\r\nthe world, a creature like his mother, who slept near the light and was\r\na bringer of meat)\xe2\x80\x94his father had a way of walking right into the white\r\nfar wall and disappearing. The grey cub could not understand this.\r\nThough never permitted by his mother to approach that wall, he had\r\napproached the other walls, and encountered hard obstruction on the end\r\nof his tender nose. This hurt. And after several such adventures, he\r\nleft the walls alone. Without thinking about it, he accepted this\r\ndisappearing into the wall as a peculiarity of his father, as milk and\r\nhalf-digested meat were peculiarities of his mother.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the grey cub was not given to thinking\xe2\x80\x94at least, to the kind\r\nof thinking customary of men. His brain worked in dim ways. Yet his\r\nconclusions were as sharp and distinct as those achieved by men. He had\r\na method of accepting things, without questioning the why and\r\nwherefore. In reality, this was the act of classification. He was never\r\ndisturbed over why a thing happened. How it happened was sufficient for\r\nhim. Thus, when he had bumped his nose on the back-wall a few times, he\r\naccepted that he would not disappear into walls. In the same way he\r\naccepted that his father could disappear into walls. But he was not in\r\nthe least disturbed by desire to find out the reason for the difference\r\nbetween his father and himself. Logic and physics were no part of his\r\nmental make-up.\r\n\r\nLike most creatures of the Wild, he early experienced famine. There\r\ncame a time when not only did the meat-supply cease, but the milk no\r\nlonger came from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s breast. At first, the cubs whimpered and\r\ncried, but for the most part they slept. It was not long before they\r\nwere reduced to a coma of hunger. There were no more spats and\r\nsquabbles, no more tiny rages nor attempts at growling; while the\r\nadventures toward the far white wall ceased altogether. The cubs slept,\r\nwhile the life that was in them flickered and died down.\r\n\r\nOne Eye was desperate. He ranged far and wide, and slept but little in\r\nthe lair that had now become cheerless and miserable. The she-wolf,\r\ntoo, left her litter and went out in search of meat. In the first days\r\nafter the birth of the cubs, One Eye had journeyed several times back\r\nto the Indian camp and robbed the rabbit snares; but, with the melting\r\nof the snow and the opening of the streams, the Indian camp had moved\r\naway, and that source of supply was closed to him.\r\n\r\nWhen the grey cub came back to life and again took interest in the far\r\nwhite wall, he found that the population of his world had been reduced.\r\nOnly one sister remained to him. The rest were gone. As he grew\r\nstronger, he found himself compelled to play alone, for the sister no\r\nlonger lifted her head nor moved about. His little body rounded out\r\nwith the meat he now ate; but the food had come too late for her. She\r\nslept continuously, a tiny skeleton flung round with skin in which the\r\nflame flickered lower and lower and at last went out.\r\n\r\nThen there came a time when the grey cub no longer saw his father\r\nappearing and disappearing in the wall nor lying down asleep in the\r\nentrance. This had happened at the end of a second and less severe\r\nfamine. The she-wolf knew why One Eye never came back, but there was no\r\nway by which she could tell what she had seen to the grey cub. Hunting\r\nherself for meat, up the left fork of the stream where lived the lynx,\r\nshe had followed a day-old trail of One Eye. And she had found him, or\r\nwhat remained of him, at the end of the trail. There were many signs of\r\nthe battle that had been fought, and of the lynx\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal to her\r\nlair after having won the victory. Before she went away, the she-wolf\r\nhad found this lair, but the signs told her that the lynx was inside,\r\nand she had not dared to venture in.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the she-wolf in her hunting avoided the left fork. For she\r\nknew that in the lynx\xe2\x80\x99s lair was a litter of kittens, and she knew the\r\nlynx for a fierce, bad-tempered creature and a terrible fighter. It was\r\nall very well for half a dozen wolves to drive a lynx, spitting and\r\nbristling, up a tree; but it was quite a different matter for a lone\r\nwolf to encounter a lynx\xe2\x80\x94especially when the lynx was known to have a\r\nlitter of hungry kittens at her back.\r\n\r\nBut the Wild is the Wild, and motherhood is motherhood, at all times\r\nfiercely protective whether in the Wild or out of it; and the time was\r\nto come when the she-wolf, for her grey cub\xe2\x80\x99s sake, would venture the\r\nleft fork, and the lair in the rocks, and the lynx\xe2\x80\x99s wrath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE WALL OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time his mother began leaving the cave on hunting expeditions,\r\nthe cub had learned well the law that forbade his approaching the\r\nentrance. Not only had this law been forcibly and many times impressed\r\non him by his mother\xe2\x80\x99s nose and paw, but in him the instinct of fear\r\nwas developing. Never, in his brief cave-life, had he encountered\r\nanything of which to be afraid. Yet fear was in him. It had come down\r\nto him from a remote ancestry through a thousand thousand lives. It was\r\na heritage he had received directly from One Eye and the she-wolf; but\r\nto them, in turn, it had been passed down through all the generations\r\nof wolves that had gone before. Fear!\xe2\x80\x94that legacy of the Wild which no\r\nanimal may escape nor exchange for pottage.\r\n\r\nSo the grey cub knew fear, though he knew not the stuff of which fear\r\nwas made. Possibly he accepted it as one of the restrictions of life.\r\nFor he had already learned that there were such restrictions. Hunger he\r\nhad known; and when he could not appease his hunger he had felt\r\nrestriction. The hard obstruction of the cave-wall, the sharp nudge of\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s nose, the smashing stroke of her paw, the hunger\r\nunappeased of several famines, had borne in upon him that all was not\r\nfreedom in the world, that to life there was limitations and\r\nrestraints. These limitations and restraints were laws. To be obedient\r\nto them was to escape hurt and make for happiness.\r\n\r\nHe did not reason the question out in this man fashion. He merely\r\nclassified the things that hurt and the things that did not hurt. And\r\nafter such classification he avoided the things that hurt, the\r\nrestrictions and restraints, in order to enjoy the satisfactions and\r\nthe remunerations of life.\r\n\r\nThus it was that in obedience to the law laid down by his mother, and\r\nin obedience to the law of that unknown and nameless thing, fear, he\r\nkept away from the mouth of the cave. It remained to him a white wall\r\nof light. When his mother was absent, he slept most of the time, while\r\nduring the intervals that he was awake he kept very quiet, suppressing\r\nthe whimpering cries that tickled in his throat and strove for noise.\r\n\r\nOnce, lying awake, he heard a strange sound in the white wall. He did\r\nnot know that it was a wolverine, standing outside, all a-trembling\r\nwith its own daring, and cautiously scenting out the contents of the\r\ncave. The cub knew only that the sniff was strange, a something\r\nunclassified, therefore unknown and terrible\xe2\x80\x94for the unknown was one of\r\nthe chief elements that went into the making of fear.\r\n\r\nThe hair bristled upon the grey cub\xe2\x80\x99s back, but it bristled silently.\r\nHow was he to know that this thing that sniffed was a thing at which to\r\nbristle? It was not born of any knowledge of his, yet it was the\r\nvisible expression of the fear that was in him, and for which, in his\r\nown life, there was no accounting. But fear was accompanied by another\r\ninstinct\xe2\x80\x94that of concealment. The cub was in a frenzy of terror, yet he\r\nlay without movement or sound, frozen, petrified into immobility, to\r\nall appearances dead. His mother, coming home, growled as she smelt the\r\nwolverine\xe2\x80\x99s track, and bounded into the cave and licked and nozzled him\r\nwith undue vehemence of affection. And the cub felt that somehow he had\r\nescaped a great hurt.\r\n\r\nBut there were other forces at work in the cub, the greatest of which\r\nwas growth. Instinct and law demanded of him obedience. But growth\r\ndemanded disobedience. His mother and fear impelled him to keep away\r\nfrom the white wall. Growth is life, and life is for ever destined to\r\nmake for light. So there was no damming up the tide of life that was\r\nrising within him\xe2\x80\x94rising with every mouthful of meat he swallowed, with\r\nevery breath he drew. In the end, one day, fear and obedience were\r\nswept away by the rush of life, and the cub straddled and sprawled\r\ntoward the entrance.\r\n\r\nUnlike any other wall with which he had had experience, this wall\r\nseemed to recede from him as he approached. No hard surface collided\r\nwith the tender little nose he thrust out tentatively before him. The\r\nsubstance of the wall seemed as permeable and yielding as light. And as\r\ncondition, in his eyes, had the seeming of form, so he entered into\r\nwhat had been wall to him and bathed in the substance that composed it.\r\n\r\nIt was bewildering. He was sprawling through solidity. And ever the\r\nlight grew brighter. Fear urged him to go back, but growth drove him\r\non. Suddenly he found himself at the mouth of the cave. The wall,\r\ninside which he had thought himself, as suddenly leaped back before him\r\nto an immeasurable distance. The light had become painfully bright. He\r\nwas dazzled by it. Likewise he was made dizzy by this abrupt and\r\ntremendous extension of space. Automatically, his eyes were adjusting\r\nthemselves to the brightness, focusing themselves to meet the increased\r\ndistance of objects. At first, the wall had leaped beyond his vision.\r\nHe now saw it again; but it had taken upon itself a remarkable\r\nremoteness. Also, its appearance had changed. It was now a variegated\r\nwall, composed of the trees that fringed the stream, the opposing\r\nmountain that towered above the trees, and the sky that out-towered the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nA great fear came upon him. This was more of the terrible unknown. He\r\ncrouched down on the lip of the cave and gazed out on the world. He was\r\nvery much afraid. Because it was unknown, it was hostile to him.\r\nTherefore the hair stood up on end along his back and his lips wrinkled\r\nweakly in an attempt at a ferocious and intimidating snarl. Out of his\r\npuniness and fright he challenged and menaced the whole wide world.\r\n\r\nNothing happened. He continued to gaze, and in his interest he forgot\r\nto snarl. Also, he forgot to be afraid. For the time, fear had been\r\nrouted by growth, while growth had assumed the guise of curiosity. He\r\nbegan to notice near objects\xe2\x80\x94an open portion of the stream that flashed\r\nin the sun, the blasted pine-tree that stood at the base of the slope,\r\nand the slope itself, that ran right up to him and ceased two feet\r\nbeneath the lip of the cave on which he crouched.\r\n\r\nNow the grey cub had lived all his days on a level floor. He had never\r\nexperienced the hurt of a fall. He did not know what a fall was. So he\r\nstepped boldly out upon the air. His hind-legs still rested on the\r\ncave-lip, so he fell forward head downward. The earth struck him a\r\nharsh blow on the nose that made him yelp. Then he began rolling down\r\nthe slope, over and over. He was in a panic of terror. The unknown had\r\ncaught him at last. It had gripped savagely hold of him and was about\r\nto wreak upon him some terrific hurt. Growth was now routed by fear,\r\nand he ki-yi\xe2\x80\x99d like any frightened puppy.\r\n\r\nThe unknown bore him on he knew not to what frightful hurt, and he\r\nyelped and ki-yi\xe2\x80\x99d unceasingly. This was a different proposition from\r\ncrouching in frozen fear while the unknown lurked just alongside. Now\r\nthe unknown had caught tight hold of him. Silence would do no good.\r\nBesides, it was not fear, but terror, that convulsed him.\r\n\r\nBut the slope grew more gradual, and its base was grass-covered. Here\r\nthe cub lost momentum. When at last he came to a stop, he gave one last\r\nagonised yell and then a long, whimpering wail. Also, and quite as a\r\nmatter of course, as though in his life he had already made a thousand\r\ntoilets, he proceeded to lick away the dry clay that soiled him.\r\n\r\nAfter that he sat up and gazed about him, as might the first man of the\r\nearth who landed upon Mars. The cub had broken through the wall of the\r\nworld, the unknown had let go its hold of him, and here he was without\r\nhurt. But the first man on Mars would have experienced less\r\nunfamiliarity than did he. Without any antecedent knowledge, without\r\nany warning whatever that such existed, he found himself an explorer in\r\na totally new world.\r\n\r\nNow that the terrible unknown had let go of him, he forgot that the\r\nunknown had any terrors. He was aware only of curiosity in all the\r\nthings about him. He inspected the grass beneath him, the moss-berry\r\nplant just beyond, and the dead trunk of the blasted pine that stood on\r\nthe edge of an open space among the trees. A squirrel, running around\r\nthe base of the trunk, came full upon him, and gave him a great fright.\r\nHe cowered down and snarled. But the squirrel was as badly scared. It\r\nran up the tree, and from a point of safety chattered back savagely.\r\n\r\nThis helped the cub\xe2\x80\x99s courage, and though the woodpecker he next\r\nencountered gave him a start, he proceeded confidently on his way. Such\r\nwas his confidence, that when a moose-bird impudently hopped up to him,\r\nhe reached out at it with a playful paw. The result was a sharp peck on\r\nthe end of his nose that made him cower down and ki-yi. The noise he\r\nmade was too much for the moose-bird, who sought safety in flight.\r\n\r\nBut the cub was learning. His misty little mind had already made an\r\nunconscious classification. There were live things and things not\r\nalive. Also, he must watch out for the live things. The things not\r\nalive remained always in one place, but the live things moved about,\r\nand there was no telling what they might do. The thing to expect of\r\nthem was the unexpected, and for this he must be prepared.\r\n\r\nHe travelled very clumsily. He ran into sticks and things. A twig that\r\nhe thought a long way off, would the next instant hit him on the nose\r\nor rake along his ribs. There were inequalities of surface. Sometimes\r\nhe overstepped and stubbed his nose. Quite as often he understepped and\r\nstubbed his feet. Then there were the pebbles and stones that turned\r\nunder him when he trod upon them; and from them he came to know that\r\nthe things not alive were not all in the same state of stable\r\nequilibrium as was his cave\xe2\x80\x94also, that small things not alive were more\r\nliable than large things to fall down or turn over. But with every\r\nmishap he was learning. The longer he walked, the better he walked. He\r\nwas adjusting himself. He was learning to calculate his own muscular\r\nmovements, to know his physical limitations, to measure distances\r\nbetween objects, and between objects and himself.\r\n\r\nHis was the luck of the beginner. Born to be a hunter of meat (though\r\nhe did not know it), he blundered upon meat just outside his own\r\ncave-door on his first foray into the world. It was by sheer blundering\r\nthat he chanced upon the shrewdly hidden ptarmigan nest. He fell into\r\nit. He had essayed to walk along the trunk of a fallen pine. The rotten\r\nbark gave way under his feet, and with a despairing yelp he pitched\r\ndown the rounded crescent, smashed through the leafage and stalks of a\r\nsmall bush, and in the heart of the bush, on the ground, fetched up in\r\nthe midst of seven ptarmigan chicks.\r\n\r\nThey made noises, and at first he was frightened at them. Then he\r\nperceived that they were very little, and he became bolder. They moved.\r\nHe placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated. This was\r\na source of enjoyment to him. He smelled it. He picked it up in his\r\nmouth. It struggled and tickled his tongue. At the same time he was\r\nmade aware of a sensation of hunger. His jaws closed together. There\r\nwas a crunching of fragile bones, and warm blood ran in his mouth. The\r\ntaste of it was good. This was meat, the same as his mother gave him,\r\nonly it was alive between his teeth and therefore better. So he ate the\r\nptarmigan. Nor did he stop till he had devoured the whole brood. Then\r\nhe licked his chops in quite the same way his mother did, and began to\r\ncrawl out of the bush.\r\n\r\nHe encountered a feathered whirlwind. He was confused and blinded by\r\nthe rush of it and the beat of angry wings. He hid his head between his\r\npaws and yelped. The blows increased. The mother ptarmigan was in a\r\nfury. Then he became angry. He rose up, snarling, striking out with his\r\npaws. He sank his tiny teeth into one of the wings and pulled and\r\ntugged sturdily. The ptarmigan struggled against him, showering blows\r\nupon him with her free wing. It was his first battle. He was elated. He\r\nforgot all about the unknown. He no longer was afraid of anything. He\r\nwas fighting, tearing at a live thing that was striking at him. Also,\r\nthis live thing was meat. The lust to kill was on him. He had just\r\ndestroyed little live things. He would now destroy a big live thing. He\r\nwas too busy and happy to know that he was happy. He was thrilling and\r\nexulting in ways new to him and greater to him than any he had known\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHe held on to the wing and growled between his tight-clenched teeth.\r\nThe ptarmigan dragged him out of the bush. When she turned and tried to\r\ndrag him back into the bush\xe2\x80\x99s shelter, he pulled her away from it and\r\non into the open. And all the time she was making outcry and striking\r\nwith her free wing, while feathers were flying like a snow-fall. The\r\npitch to which he was aroused was tremendous. All the fighting blood of\r\nhis breed was up in him and surging through him. This was living,\r\nthough he did not know it. He was realising his own meaning in the\r\nworld; he was doing that for which he was made\xe2\x80\x94killing meat and\r\nbattling to kill it. He was justifying his existence, than which life\r\ncan do no greater; for life achieves its summit when it does to the\r\nuttermost that which it was equipped to do.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, the ptarmigan ceased her struggling. He still held her by\r\nthe wing, and they lay on the ground and looked at each other. He tried\r\nto growl threateningly, ferociously. She pecked on his nose, which by\r\nnow, what of previous adventures was sore. He winced but held on. She\r\npecked him again and again. From wincing he went to whimpering. He\r\ntried to back away from her, oblivious to the fact that by his hold on\r\nher he dragged her after him. A rain of pecks fell on his ill-used\r\nnose. The flood of fight ebbed down in him, and, releasing his prey, he\r\nturned tail and scampered on across the open in inglorious retreat.\r\n\r\nHe lay down to rest on the other side of the open, near the edge of the\r\nbushes, his tongue lolling out, his chest heaving and panting, his nose\r\nstill hurting him and causing him to continue his whimper. But as he\r\nlay there, suddenly there came to him a feeling as of something\r\nterrible impending. The unknown with all its terrors rushed upon him,\r\nand he shrank back instinctively into the shelter of the bush. As he\r\ndid so, a draught of air fanned him, and a large, winged body swept\r\nominously and silently past. A hawk, driving down out of the blue, had\r\nbarely missed him.\r\n\r\nWhile he lay in the bush, recovering from his fright and peering\r\nfearfully out, the mother-ptarmigan on the other side of the open space\r\nfluttered out of the ravaged nest. It was because of her loss that she\r\npaid no attention to the winged bolt of the sky. But the cub saw, and\r\nit was a warning and a lesson to him\xe2\x80\x94the swift downward swoop of the\r\nhawk, the short skim of its body just above the ground, the strike of\r\nits talons in the body of the ptarmigan, the ptarmigan\xe2\x80\x99s squawk of\r\nagony and fright, and the hawk\xe2\x80\x99s rush upward into the blue, carrying\r\nthe ptarmigan away with it.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before the cub left its shelter. He had learned\r\nmuch. Live things were meat. They were good to eat. Also, live things\r\nwhen they were large enough, could give hurt. It was better to eat\r\nsmall live things like ptarmigan chicks, and to let alone large live\r\nthings like ptarmigan hens. Nevertheless he felt a little prick of\r\nambition, a sneaking desire to have another battle with that ptarmigan\r\nhen\xe2\x80\x94only the hawk had carried her away. May be there were other\r\nptarmigan hens. He would go and see.\r\n\r\nHe came down a shelving bank to the stream. He had never seen water\r\nbefore. The footing looked good. There were no inequalities of surface.\r\nHe stepped boldly out on it; and went down, crying with fear, into the\r\nembrace of the unknown. It was cold, and he gasped, breathing quickly.\r\nThe water rushed into his lungs instead of the air that had always\r\naccompanied his act of breathing. The suffocation he experienced was\r\nlike the pang of death. To him it signified death. He had no conscious\r\nknowledge of death, but like every animal of the Wild, he possessed the\r\ninstinct of death. To him it stood as the greatest of hurts. It was the\r\nvery essence of the unknown; it was the sum of the terrors of the\r\nunknown, the one culminating and unthinkable catastrophe that could\r\nhappen to him, about which he knew nothing and about which he feared\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nHe came to the surface, and the sweet air rushed into his open mouth.\r\nHe did not go down again. Quite as though it had been a\r\nlong-established custom of his he struck out with all his legs and\r\nbegan to swim. The near bank was a yard away; but he had come up with\r\nhis back to it, and the first thing his eyes rested upon was the\r\nopposite bank, toward which he immediately began to swim. The stream\r\nwas a small one, but in the pool it widened out to a score of feet.\r\n\r\nMidway in the passage, the current picked up the cub and swept him\r\ndownstream. He was caught in the miniature rapid at the bottom of the\r\npool. Here was little chance for swimming. The quiet water had become\r\nsuddenly angry. Sometimes he was under, sometimes on top. At all times\r\nhe was in violent motion, now being turned over or around, and again,\r\nbeing smashed against a rock. And with every rock he struck, he yelped.\r\nHis progress was a series of yelps, from which might have been adduced\r\nthe number of rocks he encountered.\r\n\r\nBelow the rapid was a second pool, and here, captured by the eddy, he\r\nwas gently borne to the bank, and as gently deposited on a bed of\r\ngravel. He crawled frantically clear of the water and lay down. He had\r\nlearned some more about the world. Water was not alive. Yet it moved.\r\nAlso, it looked as solid as the earth, but was without any solidity at\r\nall. His conclusion was that things were not always what they appeared\r\nto be. The cub\xe2\x80\x99s fear of the unknown was an inherited distrust, and it\r\nhad now been strengthened by experience. Thenceforth, in the nature of\r\nthings, he would possess an abiding distrust of appearances. He would\r\nhave to learn the reality of a thing before he could put his faith into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOne other adventure was destined for him that day. He had recollected\r\nthat there was such a thing in the world as his mother. And then there\r\ncame to him a feeling that he wanted her more than all the rest of the\r\nthings in the world. Not only was his body tired with the adventures it\r\nhad undergone, but his little brain was equally tired. In all the days\r\nhe had lived it had not worked so hard as on this one day. Furthermore,\r\nhe was sleepy. So he started out to look for the cave and his mother,\r\nfeeling at the same time an overwhelming rush of loneliness and\r\nhelplessness.\r\n\r\nHe was sprawling along between some bushes, when he heard a sharp\r\nintimidating cry. There was a flash of yellow before his eyes. He saw a\r\nweasel leaping swiftly away from him. It was a small live thing, and he\r\nhad no fear. Then, before him, at his feet, he saw an extremely small\r\nlive thing, only several inches long, a young weasel, that, like\r\nhimself, had disobediently gone out adventuring. It tried to retreat\r\nbefore him. He turned it over with his paw. It made a queer, grating\r\nnoise. The next moment the flash of yellow reappeared before his eyes.\r\nHe heard again the intimidating cry, and at the same instant received a\r\nsharp blow on the side of the neck and felt the sharp teeth of the\r\nmother-weasel cut into his flesh.\r\n\r\nWhile he yelped and ki-yi\xe2\x80\x99d and scrambled backward, he saw the\r\nmother-weasel leap upon her young one and disappear with it into the\r\nneighbouring thicket. The cut of her teeth in his neck still hurt, but\r\nhis feelings were hurt more grievously, and he sat down and weakly\r\nwhimpered. This mother-weasel was so small and so savage. He was yet to\r\nlearn that for size and weight the weasel was the most ferocious,\r\nvindictive, and terrible of all the killers of the Wild. But a portion\r\nof this knowledge was quickly to be his.\r\n\r\nHe was still whimpering when the mother-weasel reappeared. She did not\r\nrush him, now that her young one was safe. She approached more\r\ncautiously, and the cub had full opportunity to observe her lean,\r\nsnakelike body, and her head, erect, eager, and snake-like itself. Her\r\nsharp, menacing cry sent the hair bristling along his back, and he\r\nsnarled warningly at her. She came closer and closer. There was a leap,\r\nswifter than his unpractised sight, and the lean, yellow body\r\ndisappeared for a moment out of the field of his vision. The next\r\nmoment she was at his throat, her teeth buried in his hair and flesh.\r\n\r\nAt first he snarled and tried to fight; but he was very young, and this\r\nwas only his first day in the world, and his snarl became a whimper,\r\nhis fight a struggle to escape. The weasel never relaxed her hold. She\r\nhung on, striving to press down with her teeth to the great vein where\r\nhis life-blood bubbled. The weasel was a drinker of blood, and it was\r\never her preference to drink from the throat of life itself.\r\n\r\nThe grey cub would have died, and there would have been no story to\r\nwrite about him, had not the she-wolf come bounding through the bushes.\r\nThe weasel let go the cub and flashed at the she-wolf\xe2\x80\x99s throat,\r\nmissing, but getting a hold on the jaw instead. The she-wolf flirted\r\nher head like the snap of a whip, breaking the weasel\xe2\x80\x99s hold and\r\nflinging it high in the air. And, still in the air, the she-wolf\xe2\x80\x99s jaws\r\nclosed on the lean, yellow body, and the weasel knew death between the\r\ncrunching teeth.\r\n\r\nThe cub experienced another access of affection on the part of his\r\nmother. Her joy at finding him seemed even greater than his joy at\r\nbeing found. She nozzled him and caressed him and licked the cuts made\r\nin him by the weasel\xe2\x80\x99s teeth. Then, between them, mother and cub, they\r\nate the blood-drinker, and after that went back to the cave and slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE LAW OF MEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cub\xe2\x80\x99s development was rapid. He rested for two days, and then\r\nventured forth from the cave again. It was on this adventure that he\r\nfound the young weasel whose mother he had helped eat, and he saw to it\r\nthat the young weasel went the way of its mother. But on this trip he\r\ndid not get lost. When he grew tired, he found his way back to the cave\r\nand slept. And every day thereafter found him out and ranging a wider\r\narea.\r\n\r\nHe began to get accurate measurement of his strength and his weakness,\r\nand to know when to be bold and when to be cautious. He found it\r\nexpedient to be cautious all the time, except for the rare moments,\r\nwhen, assured of his own intrepidity, he abandoned himself to petty\r\nrages and lusts.\r\n\r\nHe was always a little demon of fury when he chanced upon a stray\r\nptarmigan. Never did he fail to respond savagely to the chatter of the\r\nsquirrel he had first met on the blasted pine. While the sight of a\r\nmoose-bird almost invariably put him into the wildest of rages; for he\r\nnever forgot the peck on the nose he had received from the first of\r\nthat ilk he encountered.\r\n\r\nBut there were times when even a moose-bird failed to affect him, and\r\nthose were times when he felt himself to be in danger from some other\r\nprowling meat hunter. He never forgot the hawk, and its moving shadow\r\nalways sent him crouching into the nearest thicket. He no longer\r\nsprawled and straddled, and already he was developing the gait of his\r\nmother, slinking and furtive, apparently without exertion, yet sliding\r\nalong with a swiftness that was as deceptive as it was imperceptible.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of meat, his luck had been all in the beginning. The\r\nseven ptarmigan chicks and the baby weasel represented the sum of his\r\nkillings. His desire to kill strengthened with the days, and he\r\ncherished hungry ambitions for the squirrel that chattered so volubly\r\nand always informed all wild creatures that the wolf-cub was\r\napproaching. But as birds flew in the air, squirrels could climb trees,\r\nand the cub could only try to crawl unobserved upon the squirrel when\r\nit was on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe cub entertained a great respect for his mother. She could get meat,\r\nand she never failed to bring him his share. Further, she was unafraid\r\nof things. It did not occur to him that this fearlessness was founded\r\nupon experience and knowledge. Its effect on him was that of an\r\nimpression of power. His mother represented power; and as he grew older\r\nhe felt this power in the sharper admonishment of her paw; while the\r\nreproving nudge of her nose gave place to the slash of her fangs. For\r\nthis, likewise, he respected his mother. She compelled obedience from\r\nhim, and the older he grew the shorter grew her temper.\r\n\r\nFamine came again, and the cub with clearer consciousness knew once\r\nmore the bite of hunger. The she-wolf ran herself thin in the quest for\r\nmeat. She rarely slept any more in the cave, spending most of her time\r\non the meat-trail, and spending it vainly. This famine was not a long\r\none, but it was severe while it lasted. The cub found no more milk in\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s breast, nor did he get one mouthful of meat for himself.\r\n\r\nBefore, he had hunted in play, for the sheer joyousness of it; now he\r\nhunted in deadly earnestness, and found nothing. Yet the failure of it\r\naccelerated his development. He studied the habits of the squirrel with\r\ngreater carefulness, and strove with greater craft to steal upon it and\r\nsurprise it. He studied the wood-mice and tried to dig them out of\r\ntheir burrows; and he learned much about the ways of moose-birds and\r\nwoodpeckers. And there came a day when the hawk\xe2\x80\x99s shadow did not drive\r\nhim crouching into the bushes. He had grown stronger and wiser, and\r\nmore confident. Also, he was desperate. So he sat on his haunches,\r\nconspicuously in an open space, and challenged the hawk down out of the\r\nsky. For he knew that there, floating in the blue above him, was meat,\r\nthe meat his stomach yearned after so insistently. But the hawk refused\r\nto come down and give battle, and the cub crawled away into a thicket\r\nand whimpered his disappointment and hunger.\r\n\r\nThe famine broke. The she-wolf brought home meat. It was strange meat,\r\ndifferent from any she had ever brought before. It was a lynx kitten,\r\npartly grown, like the cub, but not so large. And it was all for him.\r\nHis mother had satisfied her hunger elsewhere; though he did not know\r\nthat it was the rest of the lynx litter that had gone to satisfy her.\r\nNor did he know the desperateness of her deed. He knew only that the\r\nvelvet-furred kitten was meat, and he ate and waxed happier with every\r\nmouthful.\r\n\r\nA full stomach conduces to inaction, and the cub lay in the cave,\r\nsleeping against his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side. He was aroused by her snarling.\r\nNever had he heard her snarl so terribly. Possibly in her whole life it\r\nwas the most terrible snarl she ever gave. There was reason for it, and\r\nnone knew it better than she. A lynx\xe2\x80\x99s lair is not despoiled with\r\nimpunity. In the full glare of the afternoon light, crouching in the\r\nentrance of the cave, the cub saw the lynx-mother. The hair rippled up\r\nalong his back at the sight. Here was fear, and it did not require his\r\ninstinct to tell him of it. And if sight alone were not sufficient, the\r\ncry of rage the intruder gave, beginning with a snarl and rushing\r\nabruptly upward into a hoarse screech, was convincing enough in itself.\r\n\r\nThe cub felt the prod of the life that was in him, and stood up and\r\nsnarled valiantly by his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side. But she thrust him\r\nignominiously away and behind her. Because of the low-roofed entrance\r\nthe lynx could not leap in, and when she made a crawling rush of it the\r\nshe-wolf sprang upon her and pinned her down. The cub saw little of the\r\nbattle. There was a tremendous snarling and spitting and screeching.\r\nThe two animals threshed about, the lynx ripping and tearing with her\r\nclaws and using her teeth as well, while the she-wolf used her teeth\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nOnce, the cub sprang in and sank his teeth into the hind leg of the\r\nlynx. He clung on, growling savagely. Though he did not know it, by the\r\nweight of his body he clogged the action of the leg and thereby saved\r\nhis mother much damage. A change in the battle crushed him under both\r\ntheir bodies and wrenched loose his hold. The next moment the two\r\nmothers separated, and, before they rushed together again, the lynx\r\nlashed out at the cub with a huge fore-paw that ripped his shoulder\r\nopen to the bone and sent him hurtling sidewise against the wall. Then\r\nwas added to the uproar the cub\xe2\x80\x99s shrill yelp of pain and fright. But\r\nthe fight lasted so long that he had time to cry himself out and to\r\nexperience a second burst of courage; and the end of the battle found\r\nhim again clinging to a hind-leg and furiously growling between his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThe lynx was dead. But the she-wolf was very weak and sick. At first\r\nshe caressed the cub and licked his wounded shoulder; but the blood she\r\nhad lost had taken with it her strength, and for all of a day and a\r\nnight she lay by her dead foe\xe2\x80\x99s side, without movement, scarcely\r\nbreathing. For a week she never left the cave, except for water, and\r\nthen her movements were slow and painful. At the end of that time the\r\nlynx was devoured, while the she-wolf\xe2\x80\x99s wounds had healed sufficiently\r\nto permit her to take the meat-trail again.\r\n\r\nThe cub\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder was stiff and sore, and for some time he limped from\r\nthe terrible slash he had received. But the world now seemed changed.\r\nHe went about in it with greater confidence, with a feeling of prowess\r\nthat had not been his in the days before the battle with the lynx. He\r\nhad looked upon life in a more ferocious aspect; he had fought; he had\r\nburied his teeth in the flesh of a foe; and he had survived. And\r\nbecause of all this, he carried himself more boldly, with a touch of\r\ndefiance that was new in him. He was no longer afraid of minor things,\r\nand much of his timidity had vanished, though the unknown never ceased\r\nto press upon him with its mysteries and terrors, intangible and\r\never-menacing.\r\n\r\nHe began to accompany his mother on the meat-trail, and he saw much of\r\nthe killing of meat and began to play his part in it. And in his own\r\ndim way he learned the law of meat. There were two kinds of life\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nown kind and the other kind. His own kind included his mother and\r\nhimself. The other kind included all live things that moved. But the\r\nother kind was divided. One portion was what his own kind killed and\r\nate. This portion was composed of the non-killers and the small\r\nkillers. The other portion killed and ate his own kind, or was killed\r\nand eaten by his own kind. And out of this classification arose the\r\nlaw. The aim of life was meat. Life itself was meat. Life lived on\r\nlife. There were the eaters and the eaten. The law was: EAT OR BE\r\nEATEN. He did not formulate the law in clear, set terms and moralise\r\nabout it. He did not even think the law; he merely lived the law\r\nwithout thinking about it at all.\r\n\r\nHe saw the law operating around him on every side. He had eaten the\r\nptarmigan chicks. The hawk had eaten the ptarmigan-mother. The hawk\r\nwould also have eaten him. Later, when he had grown more formidable, he\r\nwanted to eat the hawk. He had eaten the lynx kitten. The lynx-mother\r\nwould have eaten him had she not herself been killed and eaten. And so\r\nit went. The law was being lived about him by all live things, and he\r\nhimself was part and parcel of the law. He was a killer. His only food\r\nwas meat, live meat, that ran away swiftly before him, or flew into the\r\nair, or climbed trees, or hid in the ground, or faced him and fought\r\nwith him, or turned the tables and ran after him.\r\n\r\nHad the cub thought in man-fashion, he might have epitomised life as a\r\nvoracious appetite and the world as a place wherein ranged a multitude\r\nof appetites, pursuing and being pursued, hunting and being hunted,\r\neating and being eaten, all in blindness and confusion, with violence\r\nand disorder, a chaos of gluttony and slaughter, ruled over by chance,\r\nmerciless, planless, endless.\r\n\r\nBut the cub did not think in man-fashion. He did not look at things\r\nwith wide vision. He was single-purposed, and entertained but one\r\nthought or desire at a time. Besides the law of meat, there were a\r\nmyriad other and lesser laws for him to learn and obey. The world was\r\nfilled with surprise. The stir of the life that was in him, the play of\r\nhis muscles, was an unending happiness. To run down meat was to\r\nexperience thrills and elations. His rages and battles were pleasures.\r\nTerror itself, and the mystery of the unknown, led to his living.\r\n\r\nAnd there were easements and satisfactions. To have a full stomach, to\r\ndoze lazily in the sunshine\xe2\x80\x94such things were remuneration in full for\r\nhis ardours and toils, while his ardours and tolls were in themselves\r\nself-remunerative. They were expressions of life, and life is always\r\nhappy when it is expressing itself. So the cub had no quarrel with his\r\nhostile environment. He was very much alive, very happy, and very proud\r\nof himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE MAKERS OF FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cub came upon it suddenly. It was his own fault. He had been\r\ncareless. He had left the cave and run down to the stream to drink. It\r\nmight have been that he took no notice because he was heavy with sleep.\r\n(He had been out all night on the meat-trail, and had but just then\r\nawakened.) And his carelessness might have been due to the familiarity\r\nof the trail to the pool. He had travelled it often, and nothing had\r\never happened on it.\r\n\r\nHe went down past the blasted pine, crossed the open space, and trotted\r\nin amongst the trees. Then, at the same instant, he saw and smelt.\r\nBefore him, sitting silently on their haunches, were five live things,\r\nthe like of which he had never seen before. It was his first glimpse of\r\nmankind. But at the sight of him the five men did not spring to their\r\nfeet, nor show their teeth, nor snarl. They did not move, but sat\r\nthere, silent and ominous.\r\n\r\nNor did the cub move. Every instinct of his nature would have impelled\r\nhim to dash wildly away, had there not suddenly and for the first time\r\narisen in him another and counter instinct. A great awe descended upon\r\nhim. He was beaten down to movelessness by an overwhelming sense of his\r\nown weakness and littleness. Here was mastery and power, something far\r\nand away beyond him.\r\n\r\nThe cub had never seen man, yet the instinct concerning man was his. In\r\ndim ways he recognised in man the animal that had fought itself to\r\nprimacy over the other animals of the Wild. Not alone out of his own\r\neyes, but out of the eyes of all his ancestors was the cub now looking\r\nupon man\xe2\x80\x94out of eyes that had circled in the darkness around countless\r\nwinter camp-fires, that had peered from safe distances and from the\r\nhearts of thickets at the strange, two-legged animal that was lord over\r\nliving things. The spell of the cub\xe2\x80\x99s heritage was upon him, the fear\r\nand the respect born of the centuries of struggle and the accumulated\r\nexperience of the generations. The heritage was too compelling for a\r\nwolf that was only a cub. Had he been full-grown, he would have run\r\naway. As it was, he cowered down in a paralysis of fear, already half\r\nproffering the submission that his kind had proffered from the first\r\ntime a wolf came in to sit by man\xe2\x80\x99s fire and be made warm.\r\n\r\nOne of the Indians arose and walked over to him and stooped above him.\r\nThe cub cowered closer to the ground. It was the unknown, objectified\r\nat last, in concrete flesh and blood, bending over him and reaching\r\ndown to seize hold of him. His hair bristled involuntarily; his lips\r\nwrithed back and his little fangs were bared. The hand, poised like\r\ndoom above him, hesitated, and the man spoke laughing, \xe2\x80\x9c_Wabam wabisca\r\nip pit tah_.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cLook! The white fangs!\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\nThe other Indians laughed loudly, and urged the man on to pick up the\r\ncub. As the hand descended closer and closer, there raged within the\r\ncub a battle of the instincts. He experienced two great impulsions\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nyield and to fight. The resulting action was a compromise. He did both.\r\nHe yielded till the hand almost touched him. Then he fought, his teeth\r\nflashing in a snap that sank them into the hand. The next moment he\r\nreceived a clout alongside the head that knocked him over on his side.\r\nThen all fight fled out of him. His puppyhood and the instinct of\r\nsubmission took charge of him. He sat up on his haunches and ki-yi\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\nBut the man whose hand he had bitten was angry. The cub received a\r\nclout on the other side of his head. Whereupon he sat up and ki-yi\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlouder than ever.\r\n\r\nThe four Indians laughed more loudly, while even the man who had been\r\nbitten began to laugh. They surrounded the cub and laughed at him,\r\nwhile he wailed out his terror and his hurt. In the midst of it, he\r\nheard something. The Indians heard it too. But the cub knew what it\r\nwas, and with a last, long wail that had in it more of triumph than\r\ngrief, he ceased his noise and waited for the coming of his mother, of\r\nhis ferocious and indomitable mother who fought and killed all things\r\nand was never afraid. She was snarling as she ran. She had heard the\r\ncry of her cub and was dashing to save him.\r\n\r\nShe bounded in amongst them, her anxious and militant motherhood making\r\nher anything but a pretty sight. But to the cub the spectacle of her\r\nprotective rage was pleasing. He uttered a glad little cry and bounded\r\nto meet her, while the man-animals went back hastily several steps. The\r\nshe-wolf stood over against her cub, facing the men, with bristling\r\nhair, a snarl rumbling deep in her throat. Her face was distorted and\r\nmalignant with menace, even the bridge of the nose wrinkling from tip\r\nto eyes so prodigious was her snarl.\r\n\r\nThen it was that a cry went up from one of the men. \xe2\x80\x9cKiche!\xe2\x80\x9d was what\r\nhe uttered. It was an exclamation of surprise. The cub felt his mother\r\nwilting at the sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiche!\xe2\x80\x9d the man cried again, this time with sharpness and authority.\r\n\r\nAnd then the cub saw his mother, the she-wolf, the fearless one,\r\ncrouching down till her belly touched the ground, whimpering, wagging\r\nher tail, making peace signs. The cub could not understand. He was\r\nappalled. The awe of man rushed over him again. His instinct had been\r\ntrue. His mother verified it. She, too, rendered submission to the\r\nman-animals.\r\n\r\nThe man who had spoken came over to her. He put his hand upon her head,\r\nand she only crouched closer. She did not snap, nor threaten to snap.\r\nThe other men came up, and surrounded her, and felt her, and pawed her,\r\nwhich actions she made no attempt to resent. They were greatly excited,\r\nand made many noises with their mouths. These noises were not\r\nindication of danger, the cub decided, as he crouched near his mother\r\nstill bristling from time to time but doing his best to submit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not strange,\xe2\x80\x9d an Indian was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cHer father was a wolf. It\r\nis true, her mother was a dog; but did not my brother tie her out in\r\nthe woods all of three nights in the mating season? Therefore was the\r\nfather of Kiche a wolf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a year, Grey Beaver, since she ran away,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke a second Indian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not strange, Salmon Tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d Grey Beaver answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the\r\ntime of the famine, and there was no meat for the dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has lived with the wolves,\xe2\x80\x9d said a third Indian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it would seem, Three Eagles,\xe2\x80\x9d Grey Beaver answered, laying his hand\r\non the cub; \xe2\x80\x9cand this be the sign of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cub snarled a little at the touch of the hand, and the hand flew\r\nback to administer a clout. Whereupon the cub covered its fangs, and\r\nsank down submissively, while the hand, returning, rubbed behind his\r\nears, and up and down his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis be the sign of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Grey Beaver went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is plain that his\r\nmother is Kiche. But his father was a wolf. Wherefore is there in him\r\nlittle dog and much wolf. His fangs be white, and White Fang shall be\r\nhis name. I have spoken. He is my dog. For was not Kiche my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndog? And is not my brother dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cub, who had thus received a name in the world, lay and watched.\r\nFor a time the man-animals continued to make their mouth-noises. Then\r\nGrey Beaver took a knife from a sheath that hung around his neck, and\r\nwent into the thicket and cut a stick. White Fang watched him. He\r\nnotched the stick at each end and in the notches fastened strings of\r\nraw-hide. One string he tied around the throat of Kiche. Then he led\r\nher to a small pine, around which he tied the other string.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang followed and lay down beside her. Salmon Tongue\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nreached out to him and rolled him over on his back. Kiche looked on\r\nanxiously. White Fang felt fear mounting in him again. He could not\r\nquite suppress a snarl, but he made no offer to snap. The hand, with\r\nfingers crooked and spread apart, rubbed his stomach in a playful way\r\nand rolled him from side to side. It was ridiculous and ungainly, lying\r\nthere on his back with legs sprawling in the air. Besides, it was a\r\nposition of such utter helplessness that White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s whole nature\r\nrevolted against it. He could do nothing to defend himself. If this\r\nman-animal intended harm, White Fang knew that he could not escape it.\r\nHow could he spring away with his four legs in the air above him? Yet\r\nsubmission made him master his fear, and he only growled softly. This\r\ngrowl he could not suppress; nor did the man-animal resent it by giving\r\nhim a blow on the head. And furthermore, such was the strangeness of\r\nit, White Fang experienced an unaccountable sensation of pleasure as\r\nthe hand rubbed back and forth. When he was rolled on his side he\r\nceased to growl, when the fingers pressed and prodded at the base of\r\nhis ears the pleasurable sensation increased; and when, with a final\r\nrub and scratch, the man left him alone and went away, all fear had\r\ndied out of White Fang. He was to know fear many times in his dealing\r\nwith man; yet it was a token of the fearless companionship with man\r\nthat was ultimately to be his.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, White Fang heard strange noises approaching. He was quick\r\nin his classification, for he knew them at once for man-animal noises.\r\nA few minutes later the remainder of the tribe, strung out as it was on\r\nthe march, trailed in. There were more men and many women and children,\r\nforty souls of them, and all heavily burdened with camp equipage and\r\noutfit. Also there were many dogs; and these, with the exception of the\r\npart-grown puppies, were likewise burdened with camp outfit. On their\r\nbacks, in bags that fastened tightly around underneath, the dogs\r\ncarried from twenty to thirty pounds of weight.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang had never seen dogs before, but at sight of them he felt\r\nthat they were his own kind, only somehow different. But they displayed\r\nlittle difference from the wolf when they discovered the cub and his\r\nmother. There was a rush. White Fang bristled and snarled and snapped\r\nin the face of the open-mouthed oncoming wave of dogs, and went down\r\nand under them, feeling the sharp slash of teeth in his body, himself\r\nbiting and tearing at the legs and bellies above him. There was a great\r\nuproar. He could hear the snarl of Kiche as she fought for him; and he\r\ncould hear the cries of the man-animals, the sound of clubs striking\r\nupon bodies, and the yelps of pain from the dogs so struck.\r\n\r\nOnly a few seconds elapsed before he was on his feet again. He could\r\nnow see the man-animals driving back the dogs with clubs and stones,\r\ndefending him, saving him from the savage teeth of his kind that\r\nsomehow was not his kind. And though there was no reason in his brain\r\nfor a clear conception of so abstract a thing as justice, nevertheless,\r\nin his own way, he felt the justice of the man-animals, and he knew\r\nthem for what they were\xe2\x80\x94makers of law and executors of law. Also, he\r\nappreciated the power with which they administered the law. Unlike any\r\nanimals he had ever encountered, they did not bite nor claw. They\r\nenforced their live strength with the power of dead things. Dead things\r\ndid their bidding. Thus, sticks and stones, directed by these strange\r\ncreatures, leaped through the air like living things, inflicting\r\ngrievous hurts upon the dogs.\r\n\r\nTo his mind this was power unusual, power inconceivable and beyond the\r\nnatural, power that was godlike. White Fang, in the very nature of him,\r\ncould never know anything about gods; at the best he could know only\r\nthings that were beyond knowing\xe2\x80\x94but the wonder and awe that he had of\r\nthese man-animals in ways resembled what would be the wonder and awe of\r\nman at sight of some celestial creature, on a mountain top, hurling\r\nthunderbolts from either hand at an astonished world.\r\n\r\nThe last dog had been driven back. The hubbub died down. And White Fang\r\nlicked his hurts and meditated upon this, his first taste of\r\npack-cruelty and his introduction to the pack. He had never dreamed\r\nthat his own kind consisted of more than One Eye, his mother, and\r\nhimself. They had constituted a kind apart, and here, abruptly, he had\r\ndiscovered many more creatures apparently of his own kind. And there\r\nwas a subconscious resentment that these, his kind, at first sight had\r\npitched upon him and tried to destroy him. In the same way he resented\r\nhis mother being tied with a stick, even though it was done by the\r\nsuperior man-animals. It savoured of the trap, of bondage. Yet of the\r\ntrap and of bondage he knew nothing. Freedom to roam and run and lie\r\ndown at will, had been his heritage; and here it was being infringed\r\nupon. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s movements were restricted to the length of a stick,\r\nand by the length of that same stick was he restricted, for he had not\r\nyet got beyond the need of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\nHe did not like it. Nor did he like it when the man-animals arose and\r\nwent on with their march; for a tiny man-animal took the other end of\r\nthe stick and led Kiche captive behind him, and behind Kiche followed\r\nWhite Fang, greatly perturbed and worried by this new adventure he had\r\nentered upon.\r\n\r\nThey went down the valley of the stream, far beyond White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s widest\r\nranging, until they came to the end of the valley, where the stream ran\r\ninto the Mackenzie River. Here, where canoes were cached on poles high\r\nin the air and where stood fish-racks for the drying of fish, camp was\r\nmade; and White Fang looked on with wondering eyes. The superiority of\r\nthese man-animals increased with every moment. There was their mastery\r\nover all these sharp-fanged dogs. It breathed of power. But greater\r\nthan that, to the wolf-cub, was their mastery over things not alive;\r\ntheir capacity to communicate motion to unmoving things; their capacity\r\nto change the very face of the world.\r\n\r\nIt was this last that especially affected him. The elevation of frames\r\nof poles caught his eye; yet this in itself was not so remarkable,\r\nbeing done by the same creatures that flung sticks and stones to great\r\ndistances. But when the frames of poles were made into tepees by being\r\ncovered with cloth and skins, White Fang was astounded. It was the\r\ncolossal bulk of them that impressed him. They arose around him, on\r\nevery side, like some monstrous quick-growing form of life. They\r\noccupied nearly the whole circumference of his field of vision. He was\r\nafraid of them. They loomed ominously above him; and when the breeze\r\nstirred them into huge movements, he cowered down in fear, keeping his\r\neyes warily upon them, and prepared to spring away if they attempted to\r\nprecipitate themselves upon him.\r\n\r\nBut in a short while his fear of the tepees passed away. He saw the\r\nwomen and children passing in and out of them without harm, and he saw\r\nthe dogs trying often to get into them, and being driven away with\r\nsharp words and flying stones. After a time, he left Kiche\xe2\x80\x99s side and\r\ncrawled cautiously toward the wall of the nearest tepee. It was the\r\ncuriosity of growth that urged him on\xe2\x80\x94the necessity of learning and\r\nliving and doing that brings experience. The last few inches to the\r\nwall of the tepee were crawled with painful slowness and precaution.\r\nThe day\xe2\x80\x99s events had prepared him for the unknown to manifest itself in\r\nmost stupendous and unthinkable ways. At last his nose touched the\r\ncanvas. He waited. Nothing happened. Then he smelled the strange\r\nfabric, saturated with the man-smell. He closed on the canvas with his\r\nteeth and gave a gentle tug. Nothing happened, though the adjacent\r\nportions of the tepee moved. He tugged harder. There was a greater\r\nmovement. It was delightful. He tugged still harder, and repeatedly,\r\nuntil the whole tepee was in motion. Then the sharp cry of a squaw\r\ninside sent him scampering back to Kiche. But after that he was afraid\r\nno more of the looming bulks of the tepees.\r\n\r\nA moment later he was straying away again from his mother. Her stick\r\nwas tied to a peg in the ground and she could not follow him. A\r\npart-grown puppy, somewhat larger and older than he, came toward him\r\nslowly, with ostentatious and belligerent importance. The puppy\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nas White Fang was afterward to hear him called, was Lip-lip. He had had\r\nexperience in puppy fights and was already something of a bully.\r\n\r\nLip-lip was White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s own kind, and, being only a puppy, did not\r\nseem dangerous; so White Fang prepared to meet him in a friendly\r\nspirit. But when the strangers walk became stiff-legged and his lips\r\nlifted clear of his teeth, White Fang stiffened too, and answered with\r\nlifted lips. They half circled about each other, tentatively, snarling\r\nand bristling. This lasted several minutes, and White Fang was\r\nbeginning to enjoy it, as a sort of game. But suddenly, with remarkable\r\nswiftness, Lip-lip leaped in, delivering a slashing snap, and leaped\r\naway again. The snap had taken effect on the shoulder that had been\r\nhurt by the lynx and that was still sore deep down near the bone. The\r\nsurprise and hurt of it brought a yelp out of White Fang; but the next\r\nmoment, in a rush of anger, he was upon Lip-lip and snapping viciously.\r\n\r\nBut Lip-lip had lived his life in camp and had fought many puppy\r\nfights. Three times, four times, and half a dozen times, his sharp\r\nlittle teeth scored on the newcomer, until White Fang, yelping\r\nshamelessly, fled to the protection of his mother. It was the first of\r\nthe many fights he was to have with Lip-lip, for they were enemies from\r\nthe start, born so, with natures destined perpetually to clash.\r\n\r\nKiche licked White Fang soothingly with her tongue, and tried to\r\nprevail upon him to remain with her. But his curiosity was rampant, and\r\nseveral minutes later he was venturing forth on a new quest. He came\r\nupon one of the man-animals, Grey Beaver, who was squatting on his hams\r\nand doing something with sticks and dry moss spread before him on the\r\nground. White Fang came near to him and watched. Grey Beaver made\r\nmouth-noises which White Fang interpreted as not hostile, so he came\r\nstill nearer.\r\n\r\nWomen and children were carrying more sticks and branches to Grey\r\nBeaver. It was evidently an affair of moment. White Fang came in until\r\nhe touched Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s knee, so curious was he, and already forgetful\r\nthat this was a terrible man-animal. Suddenly he saw a strange thing\r\nlike mist beginning to arise from the sticks and moss beneath Grey\r\nBeaver\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Then, amongst the sticks themselves, appeared a live\r\nthing, twisting and turning, of a colour like the colour of the sun in\r\nthe sky. White Fang knew nothing about fire. It drew him as the light,\r\nin the mouth of the cave had drawn him in his early puppyhood. He\r\ncrawled the several steps toward the flame. He heard Grey Beaver\r\nchuckle above him, and he knew the sound was not hostile. Then his nose\r\ntouched the flame, and at the same instant his little tongue went out\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was paralysed. The unknown, lurking in the midst of the\r\nsticks and moss, was savagely clutching him by the nose. He scrambled\r\nbackward, bursting out in an astonished explosion of ki-yi\xe2\x80\x99s. At the\r\nsound, Kiche leaped snarling to the end of her stick, and there raged\r\nterribly because she could not come to his aid. But Grey Beaver laughed\r\nloudly, and slapped his thighs, and told the happening to all the rest\r\nof the camp, till everybody was laughing uproariously. But White Fang\r\nsat on his haunches and ki-yi\xe2\x80\x99d and ki-yi\xe2\x80\x99d, a forlorn and pitiable\r\nlittle figure in the midst of the man-animals.\r\n\r\nIt was the worst hurt he had ever known. Both nose and tongue had been\r\nscorched by the live thing, sun-coloured, that had grown up under Grey\r\nBeaver\xe2\x80\x99s hands. He cried and cried interminably, and every fresh wail\r\nwas greeted by bursts of laughter on the part of the man-animals. He\r\ntried to soothe his nose with his tongue, but the tongue was burnt too,\r\nand the two hurts coming together produced greater hurt; whereupon he\r\ncried more hopelessly and helplessly than ever.\r\n\r\nAnd then shame came to him. He knew laughter and the meaning of it. It\r\nis not given us to know how some animals know laughter, and know when\r\nthey are being laughed at; but it was this same way that White Fang\r\nknew it. And he felt shame that the man-animals should be laughing at\r\nhim. He turned and fled away, not from the hurt of the fire, but from\r\nthe laughter that sank even deeper, and hurt in the spirit of him. And\r\nhe fled to Kiche, raging at the end of her stick like an animal gone\r\nmad\xe2\x80\x94to Kiche, the one creature in the world who was not laughing at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTwilight drew down and night came on, and White Fang lay by his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s side. His nose and tongue still hurt, but he was perplexed by\r\na greater trouble. He was homesick. He felt a vacancy in him, a need\r\nfor the hush and quietude of the stream and the cave in the cliff. Life\r\nhad become too populous. There were so many of the man-animals, men,\r\nwomen, and children, all making noises and irritations. And there were\r\nthe dogs, ever squabbling and bickering, bursting into uproars and\r\ncreating confusions. The restful loneliness of the only life he had\r\nknown was gone. Here the very air was palpitant with life. It hummed\r\nand buzzed unceasingly. Continually changing its intensity and abruptly\r\nvariant in pitch, it impinged on his nerves and senses, made him\r\nnervous and restless and worried him with a perpetual imminence of\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\nHe watched the man-animals coming and going and moving about the camp.\r\nIn fashion distantly resembling the way men look upon the gods they\r\ncreate, so looked White Fang upon the man-animals before him. They were\r\nsuperior creatures, of a verity, gods. To his dim comprehension they\r\nwere as much wonder-workers as gods are to men. They were creatures of\r\nmastery, possessing all manner of unknown and impossible potencies,\r\noverlords of the alive and the not alive\xe2\x80\x94making obey that which moved,\r\nimparting movement to that which did not move, and making life,\r\nsun-coloured and biting life, to grow out of dead moss and wood. They\r\nwere fire-makers! They were gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE BONDAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days were thronged with experience for White Fang. During the time\r\nthat Kiche was tied by the stick, he ran about over all the camp,\r\ninquiring, investigating, learning. He quickly came to know much of the\r\nways of the man-animals, but familiarity did not breed contempt. The\r\nmore he came to know them, the more they vindicated their superiority,\r\nthe more they displayed their mysterious powers, the greater loomed\r\ntheir god-likeness.\r\n\r\nTo man has been given the grief, often, of seeing his gods overthrown\r\nand his altars crumbling; but to the wolf and the wild dog that have\r\ncome in to crouch at man\xe2\x80\x99s feet, this grief has never come. Unlike man,\r\nwhose gods are of the unseen and the overguessed, vapours and mists of\r\nfancy eluding the garmenture of reality, wandering wraiths of desired\r\ngoodness and power, intangible out-croppings of self into the realm of\r\nspirit\xe2\x80\x94unlike man, the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the\r\nfire find their gods in the living flesh, solid to the touch, occupying\r\nearth-space and requiring time for the accomplishment of their ends and\r\ntheir existence. No effort of faith is necessary to believe in such a\r\ngod; no effort of will can possibly induce disbelief in such a god.\r\nThere is no getting away from it. There it stands, on its two\r\nhind-legs, club in hand, immensely potential, passionate and wrathful\r\nand loving, god and mystery and power all wrapped up and around by\r\nflesh that bleeds when it is torn and that is good to eat like any\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was with White Fang. The man-animals were gods unmistakable\r\nand unescapable. As his mother, Kiche, had rendered her allegiance to\r\nthem at the first cry of her name, so he was beginning to render his\r\nallegiance. He gave them the trail as a privilege indubitably theirs.\r\nWhen they walked, he got out of their way. When they called, he came.\r\nWhen they threatened, he cowered down. When they commanded him to go,\r\nhe went away hurriedly. For behind any wish of theirs was power to\r\nenforce that wish, power that hurt, power that expressed itself in\r\nclouts and clubs, in flying stones and stinging lashes of whips.\r\n\r\nHe belonged to them as all dogs belonged to them. His actions were\r\ntheirs to command. His body was theirs to maul, to stamp upon, to\r\ntolerate. Such was the lesson that was quickly borne in upon him. It\r\ncame hard, going as it did, counter to much that was strong and\r\ndominant in his own nature; and, while he disliked it in the learning\r\nof it, unknown to himself he was learning to like it. It was a placing\r\nof his destiny in another\xe2\x80\x99s hands, a shifting of the responsibilities\r\nof existence. This in itself was compensation, for it is always easier\r\nto lean upon another than to stand alone.\r\n\r\nBut it did not all happen in a day, this giving over of himself, body\r\nand soul, to the man-animals. He could not immediately forego his wild\r\nheritage and his memories of the Wild. There were days when he crept to\r\nthe edge of the forest and stood and listened to something calling him\r\nfar and away. And always he returned, restless and uncomfortable, to\r\nwhimper softly and wistfully at Kiche\xe2\x80\x99s side and to lick her face with\r\neager, questioning tongue.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang learned rapidly the ways of the camp. He knew the injustice\r\nand greediness of the older dogs when meat or fish was thrown out to be\r\neaten. He came to know that men were more just, children more cruel,\r\nand women more kindly and more likely to toss him a bit of meat or\r\nbone. And after two or three painful adventures with the mothers of\r\npart-grown puppies, he came into the knowledge that it was always good\r\npolicy to let such mothers alone, to keep away from them as far as\r\npossible, and to avoid them when he saw them coming.\r\n\r\nBut the bane of his life was Lip-lip. Larger, older, and stronger,\r\nLip-lip had selected White Fang for his special object of persecution.\r\nWhite Fang fought willingly enough, but he was outclassed. His enemy\r\nwas too big. Lip-lip became a nightmare to him. Whenever he ventured\r\naway from his mother, the bully was sure to appear, trailing at his\r\nheels, snarling at him, picking upon him, and watchful of an\r\nopportunity, when no man-animal was near, to spring upon him and force\r\na fight. As Lip-lip invariably won, he enjoyed it hugely. It became his\r\nchief delight in life, as it became White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s chief torment.\r\n\r\nBut the effect upon White Fang was not to cow him. Though he suffered\r\nmost of the damage and was always defeated, his spirit remained\r\nunsubdued. Yet a bad effect was produced. He became malignant and\r\nmorose. His temper had been savage by birth, but it became more savage\r\nunder this unending persecution. The genial, playful, puppyish side of\r\nhim found little expression. He never played and gambolled about with\r\nthe other puppies of the camp. Lip-lip would not permit it. The moment\r\nWhite Fang appeared near them, Lip-lip was upon him, bullying and\r\nhectoring him, or fighting with him until he had driven him away.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all this was to rob White Fang of much of his puppyhood\r\nand to make him in his comportment older than his age. Denied the\r\noutlet, through play, of his energies, he recoiled upon himself and\r\ndeveloped his mental processes. He became cunning; he had idle time in\r\nwhich to devote himself to thoughts of trickery. Prevented from\r\nobtaining his share of meat and fish when a general feed was given to\r\nthe camp-dogs, he became a clever thief. He had to forage for himself,\r\nand he foraged well, though he was oft-times a plague to the squaws in\r\nconsequence. He learned to sneak about camp, to be crafty, to know what\r\nwas going on everywhere, to see and to hear everything and to reason\r\naccordingly, and successfully to devise ways and means of avoiding his\r\nimplacable persecutor.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the days of his persecution that he played his first\r\nreally big crafty game and got there from his first taste of revenge.\r\nAs Kiche, when with the wolves, had lured out to destruction dogs from\r\nthe camps of men, so White Fang, in manner somewhat similar, lured\r\nLip-lip into Kiche\xe2\x80\x99s avenging jaws. Retreating before Lip-lip, White\r\nFang made an indirect flight that led in and out and around the various\r\ntepees of the camp. He was a good runner, swifter than any puppy of his\r\nsize, and swifter than Lip-lip. But he did not run his best in this\r\nchase. He barely held his own, one leap ahead of his pursuer.\r\n\r\nLip-lip, excited by the chase and by the persistent nearness of his\r\nvictim, forgot caution and locality. When he remembered locality, it\r\nwas too late. Dashing at top speed around a tepee, he ran full tilt\r\ninto Kiche lying at the end of her stick. He gave one yelp of\r\nconsternation, and then her punishing jaws closed upon him. She was\r\ntied, but he could not get away from her easily. She rolled him off his\r\nlegs so that he could not run, while she repeatedly ripped and slashed\r\nhim with her fangs.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he succeeded in rolling clear of her, he crawled to his\r\nfeet, badly dishevelled, hurt both in body and in spirit. His hair was\r\nstanding out all over him in tufts where her teeth had mauled. He stood\r\nwhere he had arisen, opened his mouth, and broke out the long,\r\nheart-broken puppy wail. But even this he was not allowed to complete.\r\nIn the middle of it, White Fang, rushing in, sank his teeth into\r\nLip-lip\xe2\x80\x99s hind leg. There was no fight left in Lip-lip, and he ran away\r\nshamelessly, his victim hot on his heels and worrying him all the way\r\nback to his own tepee. Here the squaws came to his aid, and White Fang,\r\ntransformed into a raging demon, was finally driven off only by a\r\nfusillade of stones.\r\n\r\nCame the day when Grey Beaver, deciding that the liability of her\r\nrunning away was past, released Kiche. White Fang was delighted with\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s freedom. He accompanied her joyfully about the camp; and,\r\nso long as he remained close by her side, Lip-lip kept a respectful\r\ndistance. White-Fang even bristled up to him and walked stiff-legged,\r\nbut Lip-lip ignored the challenge. He was no fool himself, and whatever\r\nvengeance he desired to wreak, he could wait until he caught White Fang\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nLater on that day, Kiche and White Fang strayed into the edge of the\r\nwoods next to the camp. He had led his mother there, step by step, and\r\nnow when she stopped, he tried to inveigle her farther. The stream, the\r\nlair, and the quiet woods were calling to him, and he wanted her to\r\ncome. He ran on a few steps, stopped, and looked back. She had not\r\nmoved. He whined pleadingly, and scurried playfully in and out of the\r\nunderbrush. He ran back to her, licked her face, and ran on again. And\r\nstill she did not move. He stopped and regarded her, all of an\r\nintentness and eagerness, physically expressed, that slowly faded out\r\nof him as she turned her head and gazed back at the camp.\r\n\r\nThere was something calling to him out there in the open. His mother\r\nheard it too. But she heard also that other and louder call, the call\r\nof the fire and of man\xe2\x80\x94the call which has been given alone of all\r\nanimals to the wolf to answer, to the wolf and the wild-dog, who are\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nKiche turned and slowly trotted back toward camp. Stronger than the\r\nphysical restraint of the stick was the clutch of the camp upon her.\r\nUnseen and occultly, the gods still gripped with their power and would\r\nnot let her go. White Fang sat down in the shadow of a birch and\r\nwhimpered softly. There was a strong smell of pine, and subtle wood\r\nfragrances filled the air, reminding him of his old life of freedom\r\nbefore the days of his bondage. But he was still only a part-grown\r\npuppy, and stronger than the call either of man or of the Wild was the\r\ncall of his mother. All the hours of his short life he had depended\r\nupon her. The time was yet to come for independence. So he arose and\r\ntrotted forlornly back to camp, pausing once, and twice, to sit down\r\nand whimper and to listen to the call that still sounded in the depths\r\nof the forest.\r\n\r\nIn the Wild the time of a mother with her young is short; but under the\r\ndominion of man it is sometimes even shorter. Thus it was with White\r\nFang. Grey Beaver was in the debt of Three Eagles. Three Eagles was\r\ngoing away on a trip up the Mackenzie to the Great Slave Lake. A strip\r\nof scarlet cloth, a bearskin, twenty cartridges, and Kiche, went to pay\r\nthe debt. White Fang saw his mother taken aboard Three Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 canoe,\r\nand tried to follow her. A blow from Three Eagles knocked him backward\r\nto the land. The canoe shoved off. He sprang into the water and swam\r\nafter it, deaf to the sharp cries of Grey Beaver to return. Even a\r\nman-animal, a god, White Fang ignored, such was the terror he was in of\r\nlosing his mother.\r\n\r\nBut gods are accustomed to being obeyed, and Grey Beaver wrathfully\r\nlaunched a canoe in pursuit. When he overtook White Fang, he reached\r\ndown and by the nape of the neck lifted him clear of the water. He did\r\nnot deposit him at once in the bottom of the canoe. Holding him\r\nsuspended with one hand, with the other hand he proceeded to give him a\r\nbeating. And it _was_ a beating. His hand was heavy. Every blow was\r\nshrewd to hurt; and he delivered a multitude of blows.\r\n\r\nImpelled by the blows that rained upon him, now from this side, now\r\nfrom that, White Fang swung back and forth like an erratic and jerky\r\npendulum. Varying were the emotions that surged through him. At first,\r\nhe had known surprise. Then came a momentary fear, when he yelped\r\nseveral times to the impact of the hand. But this was quickly followed\r\nby anger. His free nature asserted itself, and he showed his teeth and\r\nsnarled fearlessly in the face of the wrathful god. This but served to\r\nmake the god more wrathful. The blows came faster, heavier, more shrewd\r\nto hurt.\r\n\r\nGrey Beaver continued to beat, White Fang continued to snarl. But this\r\ncould not last for ever. One or the other must give over, and that one\r\nwas White Fang. Fear surged through him again. For the first time he\r\nwas being really man-handled. The occasional blows of sticks and stones\r\nhe had previously experienced were as caresses compared with this. He\r\nbroke down and began to cry and yelp. For a time each blow brought a\r\nyelp from him; but fear passed into terror, until finally his yelps\r\nwere voiced in unbroken succession, unconnected with the rhythm of the\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nAt last Grey Beaver withheld his hand. White Fang, hanging limply,\r\ncontinued to cry. This seemed to satisfy his master, who flung him down\r\nroughly in the bottom of the canoe. In the meantime the canoe had\r\ndrifted down the stream. Grey Beaver picked up the paddle. White Fang\r\nwas in his way. He spurned him savagely with his foot. In that moment\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s free nature flashed forth again, and he sank his teeth\r\ninto the moccasined foot.\r\n\r\nThe beating that had gone before was as nothing compared with the\r\nbeating he now received. Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s wrath was terrible; likewise was\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s fright. Not only the hand, but the hard wooden paddle was\r\nused upon him; and he was bruised and sore in all his small body when\r\nhe was again flung down in the canoe. Again, and this time with\r\npurpose, did Grey Beaver kick him. White Fang did not repeat his attack\r\non the foot. He had learned another lesson of his bondage. Never, no\r\nmatter what the circumstance, must he dare to bite the god who was lord\r\nand master over him; the body of the lord and master was sacred, not to\r\nbe defiled by the teeth of such as he. That was evidently the crime of\r\ncrimes, the one offence there was no condoning nor overlooking.\r\n\r\nWhen the canoe touched the shore, White Fang lay whimpering and\r\nmotionless, waiting the will of Grey Beaver. It was Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s will\r\nthat he should go ashore, for ashore he was flung, striking heavily on\r\nhis side and hurting his bruises afresh. He crawled tremblingly to his\r\nfeet and stood whimpering. Lip-lip, who had watched the whole\r\nproceeding from the bank, now rushed upon him, knocking him over and\r\nsinking his teeth into him. White Fang was too helpless to defend\r\nhimself, and it would have gone hard with him had not Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfoot shot out, lifting Lip-lip into the air with its violence so that\r\nhe smashed down to earth a dozen feet away. This was the man-animal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njustice; and even then, in his own pitiable plight, White Fang\r\nexperienced a little grateful thrill. At Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s heels he limped\r\nobediently through the village to the tepee. And so it came that White\r\nFang learned that the right to punish was something the gods reserved\r\nfor themselves and denied to the lesser creatures under them.\r\n\r\nThat night, when all was still, White Fang remembered his mother and\r\nsorrowed for her. He sorrowed too loudly and woke up Grey Beaver, who\r\nbeat him. After that he mourned gently when the gods were around. But\r\nsometimes, straying off to the edge of the woods by himself, he gave\r\nvent to his grief, and cried it out with loud whimperings and wailings.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that he might have harkened to the memories\r\nof the lair and the stream and run back to the Wild. But the memory of\r\nhis mother held him. As the hunting man-animals went out and came back,\r\nso she would come back to the village some time. So he remained in his\r\nbondage waiting for her.\r\n\r\nBut it was not altogether an unhappy bondage. There was much to\r\ninterest him. Something was always happening. There was no end to the\r\nstrange things these gods did, and he was always curious to see.\r\nBesides, he was learning how to get along with Grey Beaver. Obedience,\r\nrigid, undeviating obedience, was what was exacted of him; and in\r\nreturn he escaped beatings and his existence was tolerated.\r\n\r\nNay, Grey Beaver himself sometimes tossed him a piece of meat, and\r\ndefended him against the other dogs in the eating of it. And such a\r\npiece of meat was of value. It was worth more, in some strange way,\r\nthen a dozen pieces of meat from the hand of a squaw. Grey Beaver never\r\npetted nor caressed. Perhaps it was the weight of his hand, perhaps his\r\njustice, perhaps the sheer power of him, and perhaps it was all these\r\nthings that influenced White Fang; for a certain tie of attachment was\r\nforming between him and his surly lord.\r\n\r\nInsidiously, and by remote ways, as well as by the power of stick and\r\nstone and clout of hand, were the shackles of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s bondage\r\nbeing riveted upon him. The qualities in his kind that in the beginning\r\nmade it possible for them to come in to the fires of men, were\r\nqualities capable of development. They were developing in him, and the\r\ncamp-life, replete with misery as it was, was secretly endearing itself\r\nto him all the time. But White Fang was unaware of it. He knew only\r\ngrief for the loss of Kiche, hope for her return, and a hungry yearning\r\nfor the free life that had been his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE OUTCAST\r\n\r\n\r\nLip-lip continued so to darken his days that White Fang became wickeder\r\nand more ferocious than it was his natural right to be. Savageness was\r\na part of his make-up, but the savageness thus developed exceeded his\r\nmake-up. He acquired a reputation for wickedness amongst the\r\nman-animals themselves. Wherever there was trouble and uproar in camp,\r\nfighting and squabbling or the outcry of a squaw over a bit of stolen\r\nmeat, they were sure to find White Fang mixed up in it and usually at\r\nthe bottom of it. They did not bother to look after the causes of his\r\nconduct. They saw only the effects, and the effects were bad. He was a\r\nsneak and a thief, a mischief-maker, a fomenter of trouble; and irate\r\nsquaws told him to his face, the while he eyed them alert and ready to\r\ndodge any quick-flung missile, that he was a wolf and worthless and\r\nbound to come to an evil end.\r\n\r\nHe found himself an outcast in the midst of the populous camp. All the\r\nyoung dogs followed Lip-lip\xe2\x80\x99s lead. There was a difference between\r\nWhite Fang and them. Perhaps they sensed his wild-wood breed, and\r\ninstinctively felt for him the enmity that the domestic dog feels for\r\nthe wolf. But be that as it may, they joined with Lip-lip in the\r\npersecution. And, once declared against him, they found good reason to\r\ncontinue declared against him. One and all, from time to time, they\r\nfelt his teeth; and to his credit, he gave more than he received. Many\r\nof them he could whip in single fight; but single fight was denied him.\r\nThe beginning of such a fight was a signal for all the young dogs in\r\ncamp to come running and pitch upon him.\r\n\r\nOut of this pack-persecution he learned two important things: how to\r\ntake care of himself in a mass-fight against him\xe2\x80\x94and how, on a single\r\ndog, to inflict the greatest amount of damage in the briefest space of\r\ntime. To keep one\xe2\x80\x99s feet in the midst of the hostile mass meant life,\r\nand this he learnt well. He became cat-like in his ability to stay on\r\nhis feet. Even grown dogs might hurtle him backward or sideways with\r\nthe impact of their heavy bodies; and backward or sideways he would go,\r\nin the air or sliding on the ground, but always with his legs under him\r\nand his feet downward to the mother earth.\r\n\r\nWhen dogs fight, there are usually preliminaries to the actual\r\ncombat\xe2\x80\x94snarlings and bristlings and stiff-legged struttings. But White\r\nFang learned to omit these preliminaries. Delay meant the coming\r\nagainst him of all the young dogs. He must do his work quickly and get\r\naway. So he learnt to give no warning of his intention. He rushed in\r\nand snapped and slashed on the instant, without notice, before his foe\r\ncould prepare to meet him. Thus he learned how to inflict quick and\r\nsevere damage. Also he learned the value of surprise. A dog, taken off\r\nits guard, its shoulder slashed open or its ear ripped in ribbons\r\nbefore it knew what was happening, was a dog half whipped.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was remarkably easy to overthrow a dog taken by\r\nsurprise; while a dog, thus overthrown, invariably exposed for a moment\r\nthe soft underside of its neck\xe2\x80\x94the vulnerable point at which to strike\r\nfor its life. White Fang knew this point. It was a knowledge bequeathed\r\nto him directly from the hunting generation of wolves. So it was that\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s method when he took the offensive, was: first to find a\r\nyoung dog alone; second, to surprise it and knock it off its feet; and\r\nthird, to drive in with his teeth at the soft throat.\r\n\r\nBeing but partly grown his jaws had not yet become large enough nor\r\nstrong enough to make his throat-attack deadly; but many a young dog\r\nwent around camp with a lacerated throat in token of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintention. And one day, catching one of his enemies alone on the edge\r\nof the woods, he managed, by repeatedly overthrowing him and attacking\r\nthe throat, to cut the great vein and let out the life. There was a\r\ngreat row that night. He had been observed, the news had been carried\r\nto the dead dog\xe2\x80\x99s master, the squaws remembered all the instances of\r\nstolen meat, and Grey Beaver was beset by many angry voices. But he\r\nresolutely held the door of his tepee, inside which he had placed the\r\nculprit, and refused to permit the vengeance for which his tribespeople\r\nclamoured.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang became hated by man and dog. During this period of his\r\ndevelopment he never knew a moment\xe2\x80\x99s security. The tooth of every dog\r\nwas against him, the hand of every man. He was greeted with snarls by\r\nhis kind, with curses and stones by his gods. He lived tensely. He was\r\nalways keyed up, alert for attack, wary of being attacked, with an eye\r\nfor sudden and unexpected missiles, prepared to act precipitately and\r\ncoolly, to leap in with a flash of teeth, or to leap away with a\r\nmenacing snarl.\r\n\r\nAs for snarling he could snarl more terribly than any dog, young or\r\nold, in camp. The intent of the snarl is to warn or frighten, and\r\njudgment is required to know when it should be used. White Fang knew\r\nhow to make it and when to make it. Into his snarl he incorporated all\r\nthat was vicious, malignant, and horrible. With nose serrulated by\r\ncontinuous spasms, hair bristling in recurrent waves, tongue whipping\r\nout like a red snake and whipping back again, ears flattened down, eyes\r\ngleaming hatred, lips wrinkled back, and fangs exposed and dripping, he\r\ncould compel a pause on the part of almost any assailant. A temporary\r\npause, when taken off his guard, gave him the vital moment in which to\r\nthink and determine his action. But often a pause so gained lengthened\r\nout until it evolved into a complete cessation from the attack. And\r\nbefore more than one of the grown dogs White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s snarl enabled him\r\nto beat an honourable retreat.\r\n\r\nAn outcast himself from the pack of the part-grown dogs, his sanguinary\r\nmethods and remarkable efficiency made the pack pay for its persecution\r\nof him. Not permitted himself to run with the pack, the curious state\r\nof affairs obtained that no member of the pack could run outside the\r\npack. White Fang would not permit it. What of his bushwhacking and\r\nwaylaying tactics, the young dogs were afraid to run by themselves.\r\nWith the exception of Lip-lip, they were compelled to hunch together\r\nfor mutual protection against the terrible enemy they had made. A puppy\r\nalone by the river bank meant a puppy dead or a puppy that aroused the\r\ncamp with its shrill pain and terror as it fled back from the wolf-cub\r\nthat had waylaid it.\r\n\r\nBut White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s reprisals did not cease, even when the young dogs had\r\nlearned thoroughly that they must stay together. He attacked them when\r\nhe caught them alone, and they attacked him when they were bunched. The\r\nsight of him was sufficient to start them rushing after him, at which\r\ntimes his swiftness usually carried him into safety. But woe the dog\r\nthat outran his fellows in such pursuit! White Fang had learned to turn\r\nsuddenly upon the pursuer that was ahead of the pack and thoroughly to\r\nrip him up before the pack could arrive. This occurred with great\r\nfrequency, for, once in full cry, the dogs were prone to forget\r\nthemselves in the excitement of the chase, while White Fang never\r\nforgot himself. Stealing backward glances as he ran, he was always\r\nready to whirl around and down the overzealous pursuer that outran his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nYoung dogs are bound to play, and out of the exigencies of the\r\nsituation they realised their play in this mimic warfare. Thus it was\r\nthat the hunt of White Fang became their chief game\xe2\x80\x94a deadly game,\r\nwithal, and at all times a serious game. He, on the other hand, being\r\nthe fastest-footed, was unafraid to venture anywhere. During the period\r\nthat he waited vainly for his mother to come back, he led the pack many\r\na wild chase through the adjacent woods. But the pack invariably lost\r\nhim. Its noise and outcry warned him of its presence, while he ran\r\nalone, velvet-footed, silently, a moving shadow among the trees after\r\nthe manner of his father and mother before him. Further he was more\r\ndirectly connected with the Wild than they; and he knew more of its\r\nsecrets and stratagems. A favourite trick of his was to lose his trail\r\nin running water and then lie quietly in a near-by thicket while their\r\nbaffled cries arose around him.\r\n\r\nHated by his kind and by mankind, indomitable, perpetually warred upon\r\nand himself waging perpetual war, his development was rapid and\r\none-sided. This was no soil for kindliness and affection to blossom in.\r\nOf such things he had not the faintest glimmering. The code he learned\r\nwas to obey the strong and to oppress the weak. Grey Beaver was a god,\r\nand strong. Therefore White Fang obeyed him. But the dog younger or\r\nsmaller than himself was weak, a thing to be destroyed. His development\r\nwas in the direction of power. In order to face the constant danger of\r\nhurt and even of destruction, his predatory and protective faculties\r\nwere unduly developed. He became quicker of movement than the other\r\ndogs, swifter of foot, craftier, deadlier, more lithe, more lean with\r\nironlike muscle and sinew, more enduring, more cruel, more ferocious,\r\nand more intelligent. He had to become all these things, else he would\r\nnot have held his own nor survive the hostile environment in which he\r\nfound himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE TRAIL OF THE GODS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the year, when the days were shortening and the bite of\r\nthe frost was coming into the air, White Fang got his chance for\r\nliberty. For several days there had been a great hubbub in the village.\r\nThe summer camp was being dismantled, and the tribe, bag and baggage,\r\nwas preparing to go off to the fall hunting. White Fang watched it all\r\nwith eager eyes, and when the tepees began to come down and the canoes\r\nwere loading at the bank, he understood. Already the canoes were\r\ndeparting, and some had disappeared down the river.\r\n\r\nQuite deliberately he determined to stay behind. He waited his\r\nopportunity to slink out of camp to the woods. Here, in the running\r\nstream where ice was beginning to form, he hid his trail. Then he\r\ncrawled into the heart of a dense thicket and waited. The time passed\r\nby, and he slept intermittently for hours. Then he was aroused by Grey\r\nBeaver\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling him by name. There were other voices. White Fang\r\ncould hear Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s squaw taking part in the search, and Mit-sah,\r\nwho was Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang trembled with fear, and though the impulse came to crawl out\r\nof his hiding-place, he resisted it. After a time the voices died away,\r\nand some time after that he crept out to enjoy the success of his\r\nundertaking. Darkness was coming on, and for a while he played about\r\namong the trees, pleasuring in his freedom. Then, and quite suddenly,\r\nhe became aware of loneliness. He sat down to consider, listening to\r\nthe silence of the forest and perturbed by it. That nothing moved nor\r\nsounded, seemed ominous. He felt the lurking of danger, unseen and\r\nunguessed. He was suspicious of the looming bulks of the trees and of\r\nthe dark shadows that might conceal all manner of perilous things.\r\n\r\nThen it was cold. Here was no warm side of a tepee against which to\r\nsnuggle. The frost was in his feet, and he kept lifting first one\r\nfore-foot and then the other. He curved his bushy tail around to cover\r\nthem, and at the same time he saw a vision. There was nothing strange\r\nabout it. Upon his inward sight was impressed a succession of\r\nmemory-pictures. He saw the camp again, the tepees, and the blaze of\r\nthe fires. He heard the shrill voices of the women, the gruff basses of\r\nthe men, and the snarling of the dogs. He was hungry, and he remembered\r\npieces of meat and fish that had been thrown him. Here was no meat,\r\nnothing but a threatening and inedible silence.\r\n\r\nHis bondage had softened him. Irresponsibility had weakened him. He had\r\nforgotten how to shift for himself. The night yawned about him. His\r\nsenses, accustomed to the hum and bustle of the camp, used to the\r\ncontinuous impact of sights and sounds, were now left idle. There was\r\nnothing to do, nothing to see nor hear. They strained to catch some\r\ninterruption of the silence and immobility of nature. They were\r\nappalled by inaction and by the feel of something terrible impending.\r\n\r\nHe gave a great start of fright. A colossal and formless something was\r\nrushing across the field of his vision. It was a tree-shadow flung by\r\nthe moon, from whose face the clouds had been brushed away. Reassured,\r\nhe whimpered softly; then he suppressed the whimper for fear that it\r\nmight attract the attention of the lurking dangers.\r\n\r\nA tree, contracting in the cool of the night, made a loud noise. It was\r\ndirectly above him. He yelped in his fright. A panic seized him, and he\r\nran madly toward the village. He knew an overpowering desire for the\r\nprotection and companionship of man. In his nostrils was the smell of\r\nthe camp-smoke. In his ears the camp-sounds and cries were ringing\r\nloud. He passed out of the forest and into the moonlit open where were\r\nno shadows nor darknesses. But no village greeted his eyes. He had\r\nforgotten. The village had gone away.\r\n\r\nHis wild flight ceased abruptly. There was no place to which to flee.\r\nHe slunk forlornly through the deserted camp, smelling the\r\nrubbish-heaps and the discarded rags and tags of the gods. He would\r\nhave been glad for the rattle of stones about him, flung by an angry\r\nsquaw, glad for the hand of Grey Beaver descending upon him in wrath;\r\nwhile he would have welcomed with delight Lip-lip and the whole\r\nsnarling, cowardly pack.\r\n\r\nHe came to where Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s tepee had stood. In the centre of the\r\nspace it had occupied, he sat down. He pointed his nose at the moon.\r\nHis throat was afflicted by rigid spasms, his mouth opened, and in a\r\nheart-broken cry bubbled up his loneliness and fear, his grief for\r\nKiche, all his past sorrows and miseries as well as his apprehension of\r\nsufferings and dangers to come. It was the long wolf-howl,\r\nfull-throated and mournful, the first howl he had ever uttered.\r\n\r\nThe coming of daylight dispelled his fears but increased his\r\nloneliness. The naked earth, which so shortly before had been so\r\npopulous; thrust his loneliness more forcibly upon him. It did not take\r\nhim long to make up his mind. He plunged into the forest and followed\r\nthe river bank down the stream. All day he ran. He did not rest. He\r\nseemed made to run on for ever. His iron-like body ignored fatigue. And\r\neven after fatigue came, his heritage of endurance braced him to\r\nendless endeavour and enabled him to drive his complaining body onward.\r\n\r\nWhere the river swung in against precipitous bluffs, he climbed the\r\nhigh mountains behind. Rivers and streams that entered the main river\r\nhe forded or swam. Often he took to the rim-ice that was beginning to\r\nform, and more than once he crashed through and struggled for life in\r\nthe icy current. Always he was on the lookout for the trail of the gods\r\nwhere it might leave the river and proceed inland.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang was intelligent beyond the average of his kind; yet his\r\nmental vision was not wide enough to embrace the other bank of the\r\nMackenzie. What if the trail of the gods led out on that side? It never\r\nentered his head. Later on, when he had travelled more and grown older\r\nand wiser and come to know more of trails and rivers, it might be that\r\nhe could grasp and apprehend such a possibility. But that mental power\r\nwas yet in the future. Just now he ran blindly, his own bank of the\r\nMackenzie alone entering into his calculations.\r\n\r\nAll night he ran, blundering in the darkness into mishaps and obstacles\r\nthat delayed but did not daunt. By the middle of the second day he had\r\nbeen running continuously for thirty hours, and the iron of his flesh\r\nwas giving out. It was the endurance of his mind that kept him going.\r\nHe had not eaten in forty hours, and he was weak with hunger. The\r\nrepeated drenchings in the icy water had likewise had their effect on\r\nhim. His handsome coat was draggled. The broad pads of his feet were\r\nbruised and bleeding. He had begun to limp, and this limp increased\r\nwith the hours. To make it worse, the light of the sky was obscured and\r\nsnow began to fall\xe2\x80\x94a raw, moist, melting, clinging snow, slippery under\r\nfoot, that hid from him the landscape he traversed, and that covered\r\nover the inequalities of the ground so that the way of his feet was\r\nmore difficult and painful.\r\n\r\nGrey Beaver had intended camping that night on the far bank of the\r\nMackenzie, for it was in that direction that the hunting lay. But on\r\nthe near bank, shortly before dark, a moose coming down to drink, had\r\nbeen espied by Kloo-kooch, who was Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s squaw. Now, had not\r\nthe moose come down to drink, had not Mit-sah been steering out of the\r\ncourse because of the snow, had not Kloo-kooch sighted the moose, and\r\nhad not Grey Beaver killed it with a lucky shot from his rifle, all\r\nsubsequent things would have happened differently. Grey Beaver would\r\nnot have camped on the near side of the Mackenzie, and White Fang would\r\nhave passed by and gone on, either to die or to find his way to his\r\nwild brothers and become one of them\xe2\x80\x94a wolf to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nNight had fallen. The snow was flying more thickly, and White Fang,\r\nwhimpering softly to himself as he stumbled and limped along, came upon\r\na fresh trail in the snow. So fresh was it that he knew it immediately\r\nfor what it was. Whining with eagerness, he followed back from the\r\nriver bank and in among the trees. The camp-sounds came to his ears. He\r\nsaw the blaze of the fire, Kloo-kooch cooking, and Grey Beaver\r\nsquatting on his hams and mumbling a chunk of raw tallow. There was\r\nfresh meat in camp!\r\n\r\nWhite Fang expected a beating. He crouched and bristled a little at the\r\nthought of it. Then he went forward again. He feared and disliked the\r\nbeating he knew to be waiting for him. But he knew, further, that the\r\ncomfort of the fire would be his, the protection of the gods, the\r\ncompanionship of the dogs\xe2\x80\x94the last, a companionship of enmity, but none\r\nthe less a companionship and satisfying to his gregarious needs.\r\n\r\nHe came cringing and crawling into the firelight. Grey Beaver saw him,\r\nand stopped munching the tallow. White Fang crawled slowly, cringing\r\nand grovelling in the abjectness of his abasement and submission. He\r\ncrawled straight toward Grey Beaver, every inch of his progress\r\nbecoming slower and more painful. At last he lay at the master\xe2\x80\x99s feet,\r\ninto whose possession he now surrendered himself, voluntarily, body and\r\nsoul. Of his own choice, he came in to sit by man\xe2\x80\x99s fire and to be\r\nruled by him. White Fang trembled, waiting for the punishment to fall\r\nupon him. There was a movement of the hand above him. He cringed\r\ninvoluntarily under the expected blow. It did not fall. He stole a\r\nglance upward. Grey Beaver was breaking the lump of tallow in half!\r\nGrey Beaver was offering him one piece of the tallow! Very gently and\r\nsomewhat suspiciously, he first smelled the tallow and then proceeded\r\nto eat it. Grey Beaver ordered meat to be brought to him, and guarded\r\nhim from the other dogs while he ate. After that, grateful and content,\r\nWhite Fang lay at Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s feet, gazing at the fire that warmed\r\nhim, blinking and dozing, secure in the knowledge that the morrow would\r\nfind him, not wandering forlorn through bleak forest-stretches, but in\r\nthe camp of the man-animals, with the gods to whom he had given himself\r\nand upon whom he was now dependent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE COVENANT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen December was well along, Grey Beaver went on a journey up the\r\nMackenzie. Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch went with him. One sled he drove\r\nhimself, drawn by dogs he had traded for or borrowed. A second and\r\nsmaller sled was driven by Mit-sah, and to this was harnessed a team of\r\npuppies. It was more of a toy affair than anything else, yet it was the\r\ndelight of Mit-sah, who felt that he was beginning to do a man\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nin the world. Also, he was learning to drive dogs and to train dogs;\r\nwhile the puppies themselves were being broken in to the harness.\r\nFurthermore, the sled was of some service, for it carried nearly two\r\nhundred pounds of outfit and food.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang had seen the camp-dogs toiling in the harness, so that he\r\ndid not resent overmuch the first placing of the harness upon himself.\r\nAbout his neck was put a moss-stuffed collar, which was connected by\r\ntwo pulling-traces to a strap that passed around his chest and over his\r\nback. It was to this that was fastened the long rope by which he pulled\r\nat the sled.\r\n\r\nThere were seven puppies in the team. The others had been born earlier\r\nin the year and were nine and ten months old, while White Fang was only\r\neight months old. Each dog was fastened to the sled by a single rope.\r\nNo two ropes were of the same length, while the difference in length\r\nbetween any two ropes was at least that of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s body. Every rope was\r\nbrought to a ring at the front end of the sled. The sled itself was\r\nwithout runners, being a birch-bark toboggan, with upturned forward end\r\nto keep it from ploughing under the snow. This construction enabled the\r\nweight of the sled and load to be distributed over the largest\r\nsnow-surface; for the snow was crystal-powder and very soft. Observing\r\nthe same principle of widest distribution of weight, the dogs at the\r\nends of their ropes radiated fan-fashion from the nose of the sled, so\r\nthat no dog trod in another\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps.\r\n\r\nThere was, furthermore, another virtue in the fan-formation. The ropes\r\nof varying length prevented the dogs attacking from the rear those that\r\nran in front of them. For a dog to attack another, it would have to\r\nturn upon one at a shorter rope. In which case it would find itself\r\nface to face with the dog attacked, and also it would find itself\r\nfacing the whip of the driver. But the most peculiar virtue of all lay\r\nin the fact that the dog that strove to attack one in front of him must\r\npull the sled faster, and that the faster the sled travelled, the\r\nfaster could the dog attacked run away. Thus, the dog behind could\r\nnever catch up with the one in front. The faster he ran, the faster ran\r\nthe one he was after, and the faster ran all the dogs. Incidentally,\r\nthe sled went faster, and thus, by cunning indirection, did man\r\nincrease his mastery over the beasts.\r\n\r\nMit-sah resembled his father, much of whose grey wisdom he possessed.\r\nIn the past he had observed Lip-lip\xe2\x80\x99s persecution of White Fang; but at\r\nthat time Lip-lip was another man\xe2\x80\x99s dog, and Mit-sah had never dared\r\nmore than to shy an occasional stone at him. But now Lip-lip was his\r\ndog, and he proceeded to wreak his vengeance on him by putting him at\r\nthe end of the longest rope. This made Lip-lip the leader, and was\r\napparently an honour! but in reality it took away from him all honour,\r\nand instead of being bully and master of the pack, he now found himself\r\nhated and persecuted by the pack.\r\n\r\nBecause he ran at the end of the longest rope, the dogs had always the\r\nview of him running away before them. All that they saw of him was his\r\nbushy tail and fleeing hind legs\xe2\x80\x94a view far less ferocious and\r\nintimidating than his bristling mane and gleaming fangs. Also, dogs\r\nbeing so constituted in their mental ways, the sight of him running\r\naway gave desire to run after him and a feeling that he ran away from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe moment the sled started, the team took after Lip-lip in a chase\r\nthat extended throughout the day. At first he had been prone to turn\r\nupon his pursuers, jealous of his dignity and wrathful; but at such\r\ntimes Mit-sah would throw the stinging lash of the thirty-foot\r\ncariboo-gut whip into his face and compel him to turn tail and run on.\r\nLip-lip might face the pack, but he could not face that whip, and all\r\nthat was left him to do was to keep his long rope taut and his flanks\r\nahead of the teeth of his mates.\r\n\r\nBut a still greater cunning lurked in the recesses of the Indian mind.\r\nTo give point to unending pursuit of the leader, Mit-sah favoured him\r\nover the other dogs. These favours aroused in them jealousy and hatred.\r\nIn their presence Mit-sah would give him meat and would give it to him\r\nonly. This was maddening to them. They would rage around just outside\r\nthe throwing-distance of the whip, while Lip-lip devoured the meat and\r\nMit-sah protected him. And when there was no meat to give, Mit-sah\r\nwould keep the team at a distance and make believe to give meat to\r\nLip-lip.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang took kindly to the work. He had travelled a greater distance\r\nthan the other dogs in the yielding of himself to the rule of the gods,\r\nand he had learned more thoroughly the futility of opposing their will.\r\nIn addition, the persecution he had suffered from the pack had made the\r\npack less to him in the scheme of things, and man more. He had not\r\nlearned to be dependent on his kind for companionship. Besides, Kiche\r\nwas well-nigh forgotten; and the chief outlet of expression that\r\nremained to him was in the allegiance he tendered the gods he had\r\naccepted as masters. So he worked hard, learned discipline, and was\r\nobedient. Faithfulness and willingness characterised his toil. These\r\nare essential traits of the wolf and the wild-dog when they have become\r\ndomesticated, and these traits White Fang possessed in unusual measure.\r\n\r\nA companionship did exist between White Fang and the other dogs, but it\r\nwas one of warfare and enmity. He had never learned to play with them.\r\nHe knew only how to fight, and fight with them he did, returning to\r\nthem a hundred-fold the snaps and slashes they had given him in the\r\ndays when Lip-lip was leader of the pack. But Lip-lip was no longer\r\nleader\xe2\x80\x94except when he fled away before his mates at the end of his\r\nrope, the sled bounding along behind. In camp he kept close to Mit-sah\r\nor Grey Beaver or Kloo-kooch. He did not dare venture away from the\r\ngods, for now the fangs of all dogs were against him, and he tasted to\r\nthe dregs the persecution that had been White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nWith the overthrow of Lip-lip, White Fang could have become leader of\r\nthe pack. But he was too morose and solitary for that. He merely\r\nthrashed his team-mates. Otherwise he ignored them. They got out of his\r\nway when he came along; nor did the boldest of them ever dare to rob\r\nhim of his meat. On the contrary, they devoured their own meat\r\nhurriedly, for fear that he would take it away from them. White Fang\r\nknew the law well: _to oppress the weak and obey the strong_. He ate\r\nhis share of meat as rapidly as he could. And then woe the dog that had\r\nnot yet finished! A snarl and a flash of fangs, and that dog would wail\r\nhis indignation to the uncomforting stars while White Fang finished his\r\nportion for him.\r\n\r\nEvery little while, however, one dog or another would flame up in\r\nrevolt and be promptly subdued. Thus White Fang was kept in training.\r\nHe was jealous of the isolation in which he kept himself in the midst\r\nof the pack, and he fought often to maintain it. But such fights were\r\nof brief duration. He was too quick for the others. They were slashed\r\nopen and bleeding before they knew what had happened, were whipped\r\nalmost before they had begun to fight.\r\n\r\nAs rigid as the sled-discipline of the gods, was the discipline\r\nmaintained by White Fang amongst his fellows. He never allowed them any\r\nlatitude. He compelled them to an unremitting respect for him. They\r\nmight do as they pleased amongst themselves. That was no concern of\r\nhis. But it _was_ his concern that they leave him alone in his\r\nisolation, get out of his way when he elected to walk among them, and\r\nat all times acknowledge his mastery over them. A hint of\r\nstiff-leggedness on their part, a lifted lip or a bristle of hair, and\r\nhe would be upon them, merciless and cruel, swiftly convincing them of\r\nthe error of their way.\r\n\r\nHe was a monstrous tyrant. His mastery was rigid as steel. He oppressed\r\nthe weak with a vengeance. Not for nothing had he been exposed to the\r\npitiless struggles for life in the day of his cubhood, when his mother\r\nand he, alone and unaided, held their own and survived in the ferocious\r\nenvironment of the Wild. And not for nothing had he learned to walk\r\nsoftly when superior strength went by. He oppressed the weak, but he\r\nrespected the strong. And in the course of the long journey with Grey\r\nBeaver he walked softly indeed amongst the full-grown dogs in the camps\r\nof the strange man-animals they encountered.\r\n\r\nThe months passed by. Still continued the journey of Grey Beaver. White\r\nFang\xe2\x80\x99s strength was developed by the long hours on trail and the steady\r\ntoil at the sled; and it would have seemed that his mental development\r\nwas well-nigh complete. He had come to know quite thoroughly the world\r\nin which he lived. His outlook was bleak and materialistic. The world\r\nas he saw it was a fierce and brutal world, a world without warmth, a\r\nworld in which caresses and affection and the bright sweetnesses of the\r\nspirit did not exist.\r\n\r\nHe had no affection for Grey Beaver. True, he was a god, but a most\r\nsavage god. White Fang was glad to acknowledge his lordship, but it was\r\na lordship based upon superior intelligence and brute strength. There\r\nwas something in the fibre of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s being that made his lordship\r\na thing to be desired, else he would not have come back from the Wild\r\nwhen he did to tender his allegiance. There were deeps in his nature\r\nwhich had never been sounded. A kind word, a caressing touch of the\r\nhand, on the part of Grey Beaver, might have sounded these deeps; but\r\nGrey Beaver did not caress, nor speak kind words. It was not his way.\r\nHis primacy was savage, and savagely he ruled, administering justice\r\nwith a club, punishing transgression with the pain of a blow, and\r\nrewarding merit, not by kindness, but by withholding a blow.\r\n\r\nSo White Fang knew nothing of the heaven a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand might contain for\r\nhim. Besides, he did not like the hands of the man-animals. He was\r\nsuspicious of them. It was true that they sometimes gave meat, but more\r\noften they gave hurt. Hands were things to keep away from. They hurled\r\nstones, wielded sticks and clubs and whips, administered slaps and\r\nclouts, and, when they touched him, were cunning to hurt with pinch and\r\ntwist and wrench. In strange villages he had encountered the hands of\r\nthe children and learned that they were cruel to hurt. Also, he had\r\nonce nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose. From these\r\nexperiences he became suspicious of all children. He could not tolerate\r\nthem. When they came near with their ominous hands, he got up.\r\n\r\nIt was in a village at the Great Slave Lake, that, in the course of\r\nresenting the evil of the hands of the man-animals, he came to modify\r\nthe law that he had learned from Grey Beaver: namely, that the\r\nunpardonable crime was to bite one of the gods. In this village, after\r\nthe custom of all dogs in all villages, White Fang went foraging, for\r\nfood. A boy was chopping frozen moose-meat with an axe, and the chips\r\nwere flying in the snow. White Fang, sliding by in quest of meat,\r\nstopped and began to eat the chips. He observed the boy lay down the\r\naxe and take up a stout club. White Fang sprang clear, just in time to\r\nescape the descending blow. The boy pursued him, and he, a stranger in\r\nthe village, fled between two tepees to find himself cornered against a\r\nhigh earth bank.\r\n\r\nThere was no escape for White Fang. The only way out was between the\r\ntwo tepees, and this the boy guarded. Holding his club prepared to\r\nstrike, he drew in on his cornered quarry. White Fang was furious. He\r\nfaced the boy, bristling and snarling, his sense of justice outraged.\r\nHe knew the law of forage. All the wastage of meat, such as the frozen\r\nchips, belonged to the dog that found it. He had done no wrong, broken\r\nno law, yet here was this boy preparing to give him a beating. White\r\nFang scarcely knew what happened. He did it in a surge of rage. And he\r\ndid it so quickly that the boy did not know either. All the boy knew\r\nwas that he had in some unaccountable way been overturned into the\r\nsnow, and that his club-hand had been ripped wide open by White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nBut White Fang knew that he had broken the law of the gods. He had\r\ndriven his teeth into the sacred flesh of one of them, and could expect\r\nnothing but a most terrible punishment. He fled away to Grey Beaver,\r\nbehind whose protecting legs he crouched when the bitten boy and the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s family came, demanding vengeance. But they went away with\r\nvengeance unsatisfied. Grey Beaver defended White Fang. So did Mit-sah\r\nand Kloo-kooch. White Fang, listening to the wordy war and watching the\r\nangry gestures, knew that his act was justified. And so it came that he\r\nlearned there were gods and gods. There were his gods, and there were\r\nother gods, and between them there was a difference. Justice or\r\ninjustice, it was all the same, he must take all things from the hands\r\nof his own gods. But he was not compelled to take injustice from the\r\nother gods. It was his privilege to resent it with his teeth. And this\r\nalso was a law of the gods.\r\n\r\nBefore the day was out, White Fang was to learn more about this law.\r\nMit-sah, alone, gathering firewood in the forest, encountered the boy\r\nthat had been bitten. With him were other boys. Hot words passed. Then\r\nall the boys attacked Mit-sah. It was going hard with him. Blows were\r\nraining upon him from all sides. White Fang looked on at first. This\r\nwas an affair of the gods, and no concern of his. Then he realised that\r\nthis was Mit-sah, one of his own particular gods, who was being\r\nmaltreated. It was no reasoned impulse that made White Fang do what he\r\nthen did. A mad rush of anger sent him leaping in amongst the\r\ncombatants. Five minutes later the landscape was covered with fleeing\r\nboys, many of whom dripped blood upon the snow in token that White\r\nFang\xe2\x80\x99s teeth had not been idle. When Mit-sah told the story in camp,\r\nGrey Beaver ordered meat to be given to White Fang. He ordered much\r\nmeat to be given, and White Fang, gorged and sleepy by the fire, knew\r\nthat the law had received its verification.\r\n\r\nIt was in line with these experiences that White Fang came to learn the\r\nlaw of property and the duty of the defence of property. From the\r\nprotection of his god\xe2\x80\x99s body to the protection of his god\xe2\x80\x99s possessions\r\nwas a step, and this step he made. What was his god\xe2\x80\x99s was to be\r\ndefended against all the world\xe2\x80\x94even to the extent of biting other gods.\r\nNot only was such an act sacrilegious in its nature, but it was fraught\r\nwith peril. The gods were all-powerful, and a dog was no match against\r\nthem; yet White Fang learned to face them, fiercely belligerent and\r\nunafraid. Duty rose above fear, and thieving gods learned to leave Grey\r\nBeaver\xe2\x80\x99s property alone.\r\n\r\nOne thing, in this connection, White Fang quickly learnt, and that was\r\nthat a thieving god was usually a cowardly god and prone to run away at\r\nthe sounding of the alarm. Also, he learned that but brief time elapsed\r\nbetween his sounding of the alarm and Grey Beaver coming to his aid. He\r\ncame to know that it was not fear of him that drove the thief away, but\r\nfear of Grey Beaver. White Fang did not give the alarm by barking. He\r\nnever barked. His method was to drive straight at the intruder, and to\r\nsink his teeth in if he could. Because he was morose and solitary,\r\nhaving nothing to do with the other dogs, he was unusually fitted to\r\nguard his master\xe2\x80\x99s property; and in this he was encouraged and trained\r\nby Grey Beaver. One result of this was to make White Fang more\r\nferocious and indomitable, and more solitary.\r\n\r\nThe months went by, binding stronger and stronger the covenant between\r\ndog and man. This was the ancient covenant that the first wolf that\r\ncame in from the Wild entered into with man. And, like all succeeding\r\nwolves and wild dogs that had done likewise, White Fang worked the\r\ncovenant out for himself. The terms were simple. For the possession of\r\na flesh-and-blood god, he exchanged his own liberty. Food and fire,\r\nprotection and companionship, were some of the things he received from\r\nthe god. In return, he guarded the god\xe2\x80\x99s property, defended his body,\r\nworked for him, and obeyed him.\r\n\r\nThe possession of a god implies service. White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s was a service of\r\nduty and awe, but not of love. He did not know what love was. He had no\r\nexperience of love. Kiche was a remote memory. Besides, not only had he\r\nabandoned the Wild and his kind when he gave himself up to man, but the\r\nterms of the covenant were such that if ever he met Kiche again he\r\nwould not desert his god to go with her. His allegiance to man seemed\r\nsomehow a law of his being greater than the love of liberty, of kind\r\nand kin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE FAMINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring of the year was at hand when Grey Beaver finished his long\r\njourney. It was April, and White Fang was a year old when he pulled\r\ninto the home villages and was loosed from the harness by Mit-sah.\r\nThough a long way from his full growth, White Fang, next to Lip-lip,\r\nwas the largest yearling in the village. Both from his father, the\r\nwolf, and from Kiche, he had inherited stature and strength, and\r\nalready he was measuring up alongside the full-grown dogs. But he had\r\nnot yet grown compact. His body was slender and rangy, and his strength\r\nmore stringy than massive, His coat was the true wolf-grey, and to all\r\nappearances he was true wolf himself. The quarter-strain of dog he had\r\ninherited from Kiche had left no mark on him physically, though it had\r\nplayed its part in his mental make-up.\r\n\r\nHe wandered through the village, recognising with staid satisfaction\r\nthe various gods he had known before the long journey. Then there were\r\nthe dogs, puppies growing up like himself, and grown dogs that did not\r\nlook so large and formidable as the memory pictures he retained of\r\nthem. Also, he stood less in fear of them than formerly, stalking among\r\nthem with a certain careless ease that was as new to him as it was\r\nenjoyable.\r\n\r\nThere was Baseek, a grizzled old fellow that in his younger days had\r\nbut to uncover his fangs to send White Fang cringing and crouching to\r\nthe right about. From him White Fang had learned much of his own\r\ninsignificance; and from him he was now to learn much of the change and\r\ndevelopment that had taken place in himself. While Baseek had been\r\ngrowing weaker with age, White Fang had been growing stronger with\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nIt was at the cutting-up of a moose, fresh-killed, that White Fang\r\nlearned of the changed relations in which he stood to the dog-world. He\r\nhad got for himself a hoof and part of the shin-bone, to which quite a\r\nbit of meat was attached. Withdrawn from the immediate scramble of the\r\nother dogs\xe2\x80\x94in fact out of sight behind a thicket\xe2\x80\x94he was devouring his\r\nprize, when Baseek rushed in upon him. Before he knew what he was\r\ndoing, he had slashed the intruder twice and sprung clear. Baseek was\r\nsurprised by the other\xe2\x80\x99s temerity and swiftness of attack. He stood,\r\ngazing stupidly across at White Fang, the raw, red shin-bone between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBaseek was old, and already he had come to know the increasing valour\r\nof the dogs it had been his wont to bully. Bitter experiences these,\r\nwhich, perforce, he swallowed, calling upon all his wisdom to cope with\r\nthem. In the old days he would have sprung upon White Fang in a fury of\r\nrighteous wrath. But now his waning powers would not permit such a\r\ncourse. He bristled fiercely and looked ominously across the shin-bone\r\nat White Fang. And White Fang, resurrecting quite a deal of the old\r\nawe, seemed to wilt and to shrink in upon himself and grow small, as he\r\ncast about in his mind for a way to beat a retreat not too inglorious.\r\n\r\nAnd right here Baseek erred. Had he contented himself with looking\r\nfierce and ominous, all would have been well. White Fang, on the verge\r\nof retreat, would have retreated, leaving the meat to him. But Baseek\r\ndid not wait. He considered the victory already his and stepped forward\r\nto the meat. As he bent his head carelessly to smell it, White Fang\r\nbristled slightly. Even then it was not too late for Baseek to retrieve\r\nthe situation. Had he merely stood over the meat, head up and\r\nglowering, White Fang would ultimately have slunk away. But the fresh\r\nmeat was strong in Baseek\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils, and greed urged him to take a\r\nbite of it.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for White Fang. Fresh upon his months of mastery over\r\nhis own team-mates, it was beyond his self-control to stand idly by\r\nwhile another devoured the meat that belonged to him. He struck, after\r\nhis custom, without warning. With the first slash, Baseek\xe2\x80\x99s right ear\r\nwas ripped into ribbons. He was astounded at the suddenness of it. But\r\nmore things, and most grievous ones, were happening with equal\r\nsuddenness. He was knocked off his feet. His throat was bitten. While\r\nhe was struggling to his feet the young dog sank teeth twice into his\r\nshoulder. The swiftness of it was bewildering. He made a futile rush at\r\nWhite Fang, clipping the empty air with an outraged snap. The next\r\nmoment his nose was laid open, and he was staggering backward away from\r\nthe meat.\r\n\r\nThe situation was now reversed. White Fang stood over the shin-bone,\r\nbristling and menacing, while Baseek stood a little way off, preparing\r\nto retreat. He dared not risk a fight with this young lightning-flash,\r\nand again he knew, and more bitterly, the enfeeblement of oncoming age.\r\nHis attempt to maintain his dignity was heroic. Calmly turning his back\r\nupon young dog and shin-bone, as though both were beneath his notice\r\nand unworthy of his consideration, he stalked grandly away. Nor, until\r\nwell out of sight, did he stop to lick his bleeding wounds.\r\n\r\nThe effect on White Fang was to give him a greater faith in himself,\r\nand a greater pride. He walked less softly among the grown dogs; his\r\nattitude toward them was less compromising. Not that he went out of his\r\nway looking for trouble. Far from it. But upon his way he demanded\r\nconsideration. He stood upon his right to go his way unmolested and to\r\ngive trail to no dog. He had to be taken into account, that was all. He\r\nwas no longer to be disregarded and ignored, as was the lot of puppies,\r\nand as continued to be the lot of the puppies that were his team-mates.\r\nThey got out of the way, gave trail to the grown dogs, and gave up meat\r\nto them under compulsion. But White Fang, uncompanionable, solitary,\r\nmorose, scarcely looking to right or left, redoubtable, forbidding of\r\naspect, remote and alien, was accepted as an equal by his puzzled\r\nelders. They quickly learned to leave him alone, neither venturing\r\nhostile acts nor making overtures of friendliness. If they left him\r\nalone, he left them alone\xe2\x80\x94a state of affairs that they found, after a\r\nfew encounters, to be pre-eminently desirable.\r\n\r\nIn midsummer White Fang had an experience. Trotting along in his silent\r\nway to investigate a new tepee which had been erected on the edge of\r\nthe village while he was away with the hunters after moose, he came\r\nfull upon Kiche. He paused and looked at her. He remembered her\r\nvaguely, but he _remembered_ her, and that was more than could be said\r\nfor her. She lifted her lip at him in the old snarl of menace, and his\r\nmemory became clear. His forgotten cubhood, all that was associated\r\nwith that familiar snarl, rushed back to him. Before he had known the\r\ngods, she had been to him the centre-pin of the universe. The old\r\nfamiliar feelings of that time came back upon him, surged up within\r\nhim. He bounded towards her joyously, and she met him with shrewd fangs\r\nthat laid his cheek open to the bone. He did not understand. He backed\r\naway, bewildered and puzzled.\r\n\r\nBut it was not Kiche\xe2\x80\x99s fault. A wolf-mother was not made to remember\r\nher cubs of a year or so before. So she did not remember White Fang. He\r\nwas a strange animal, an intruder; and her present litter of puppies\r\ngave her the right to resent such intrusion.\r\n\r\nOne of the puppies sprawled up to White Fang. They were half-brothers,\r\nonly they did not know it. White Fang sniffed the puppy curiously,\r\nwhereupon Kiche rushed upon him, gashing his face a second time. He\r\nbacked farther away. All the old memories and associations died down\r\nagain and passed into the grave from which they had been resurrected.\r\nHe looked at Kiche licking her puppy and stopping now and then to snarl\r\nat him. She was without value to him. He had learned to get along\r\nwithout her. Her meaning was forgotten. There was no place for her in\r\nhis scheme of things, as there was no place for him in hers.\r\n\r\nHe was still standing, stupid and bewildered, the memories forgotten,\r\nwondering what it was all about, when Kiche attacked him a third time,\r\nintent on driving him away altogether from the vicinity. And White Fang\r\nallowed himself to be driven away. This was a female of his kind, and\r\nit was a law of his kind that the males must not fight the females. He\r\ndid not know anything about this law, for it was no generalisation of\r\nthe mind, not a something acquired by experience of the world. He knew\r\nit as a secret prompting, as an urge of instinct\xe2\x80\x94of the same instinct\r\nthat made him howl at the moon and stars of nights, and that made him\r\nfear death and the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe months went by. White Fang grew stronger, heavier, and more\r\ncompact, while his character was developing along the lines laid down\r\nby his heredity and his environment. His heredity was a life-stuff that\r\nmay be likened to clay. It possessed many possibilities, was capable of\r\nbeing moulded into many different forms. Environment served to model\r\nthe clay, to give it a particular form. Thus, had White Fang never come\r\nin to the fires of man, the Wild would have moulded him into a true\r\nwolf. But the gods had given him a different environment, and he was\r\nmoulded into a dog that was rather wolfish, but that was a dog and not\r\na wolf.\r\n\r\nAnd so, according to the clay of his nature and the pressure of his\r\nsurroundings, his character was being moulded into a certain particular\r\nshape. There was no escaping it. He was becoming more morose, more\r\nuncompanionable, more solitary, more ferocious; while the dogs were\r\nlearning more and more that it was better to be at peace with him than\r\nat war, and Grey Beaver was coming to prize him more greatly with the\r\npassage of each day.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang, seeming to sum up strength in all his qualities,\r\nnevertheless suffered from one besetting weakness. He could not stand\r\nbeing laughed at. The laughter of men was a hateful thing. They might\r\nlaugh among themselves about anything they pleased except himself, and\r\nhe did not mind. But the moment laughter was turned upon him he would\r\nfly into a most terrible rage. Grave, dignified, sombre, a laugh made\r\nhim frantic to ridiculousness. It so outraged him and upset him that\r\nfor hours he would behave like a demon. And woe to the dog that at such\r\ntimes ran foul of him. He knew the law too well to take it out of Grey\r\nBeaver; behind Grey Beaver were a club and godhead. But behind the dogs\r\nthere was nothing but space, and into this space they flew when White\r\nFang came on the scene, made mad by laughter.\r\n\r\nIn the third year of his life there came a great famine to the\r\nMackenzie Indians. In the summer the fish failed. In the winter the\r\ncariboo forsook their accustomed track. Moose were scarce, the rabbits\r\nalmost disappeared, hunting and preying animals perished. Denied their\r\nusual food-supply, weakened by hunger, they fell upon and devoured one\r\nanother. Only the strong survived. White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s gods were always\r\nhunting animals. The old and the weak of them died of hunger. There was\r\nwailing in the village, where the women and children went without in\r\norder that what little they had might go into the bellies of the lean\r\nand hollow-eyed hunters who trod the forest in the vain pursuit of\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nTo such extremity were the gods driven that they ate the soft-tanned\r\nleather of their mocassins and mittens, while the dogs ate the\r\nharnesses off their backs and the very whip-lashes. Also, the dogs ate\r\none another, and also the gods ate the dogs. The weakest and the more\r\nworthless were eaten first. The dogs that still lived, looked on and\r\nunderstood. A few of the boldest and wisest forsook the fires of the\r\ngods, which had now become a shambles, and fled into the forest, where,\r\nin the end, they starved to death or were eaten by wolves.\r\n\r\nIn this time of misery, White Fang, too, stole away into the woods. He\r\nwas better fitted for the life than the other dogs, for he had the\r\ntraining of his cubhood to guide him. Especially adept did he become in\r\nstalking small living things. He would lie concealed for hours,\r\nfollowing every movement of a cautious tree-squirrel, waiting, with a\r\npatience as huge as the hunger he suffered from, until the squirrel\r\nventured out upon the ground. Even then, White Fang was not premature.\r\nHe waited until he was sure of striking before the squirrel could gain\r\na tree-refuge. Then, and not until then, would he flash from his\r\nhiding-place, a grey projectile, incredibly swift, never failing its\r\nmark\xe2\x80\x94the fleeing squirrel that fled not fast enough.\r\n\r\nSuccessful as he was with squirrels, there was one difficulty that\r\nprevented him from living and growing fat on them. There were not\r\nenough squirrels. So he was driven to hunt still smaller things. So\r\nacute did his hunger become at times that he was not above rooting out\r\nwood-mice from their burrows in the ground. Nor did he scorn to do\r\nbattle with a weasel as hungry as himself and many times more\r\nferocious.\r\n\r\nIn the worst pinches of the famine he stole back to the fires of the\r\ngods. But he did not go into the fires. He lurked in the forest,\r\navoiding discovery and robbing the snares at the rare intervals when\r\ngame was caught. He even robbed Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s snare of a rabbit at a\r\ntime when Grey Beaver staggered and tottered through the forest,\r\nsitting down often to rest, what of weakness and of shortness of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nOne day While Fang encountered a young wolf, gaunt and scrawny,\r\nloose-jointed with famine. Had he not been hungry himself, White Fang\r\nmight have gone with him and eventually found his way into the pack\r\namongst his wild brethren. As it was, he ran the young wolf down and\r\nkilled and ate him.\r\n\r\nFortune seemed to favour him. Always, when hardest pressed for food, he\r\nfound something to kill. Again, when he was weak, it was his luck that\r\nnone of the larger preying animals chanced upon him. Thus, he was\r\nstrong from the two days\xe2\x80\x99 eating a lynx had afforded him when the\r\nhungry wolf-pack ran full tilt upon him. It was a long, cruel chase,\r\nbut he was better nourished than they, and in the end outran them. And\r\nnot only did he outrun them, but, circling widely back on his track, he\r\ngathered in one of his exhausted pursuers.\r\n\r\nAfter that he left that part of the country and journeyed over to the\r\nvalley wherein he had been born. Here, in the old lair, he encountered\r\nKiche. Up to her old tricks, she, too, had fled the inhospitable fires\r\nof the gods and gone back to her old refuge to give birth to her young.\r\nOf this litter but one remained alive when White Fang came upon the\r\nscene, and this one was not destined to live long. Young life had\r\nlittle chance in such a famine.\r\n\r\nKiche\xe2\x80\x99s greeting of her grown son was anything but affectionate. But\r\nWhite Fang did not mind. He had outgrown his mother. So he turned tail\r\nphilosophically and trotted on up the stream. At the forks he took the\r\nturning to the left, where he found the lair of the lynx with whom his\r\nmother and he had fought long before. Here, in the abandoned lair, he\r\nsettled down and rested for a day.\r\n\r\nDuring the early summer, in the last days of the famine, he met\r\nLip-lip, who had likewise taken to the woods, where he had eked out a\r\nmiserable existence.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang came upon him unexpectedly. Trotting in opposite directions\r\nalong the base of a high bluff, they rounded a corner of rock and found\r\nthemselves face to face. They paused with instant alarm, and looked at\r\neach other suspiciously.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang was in splendid condition. His hunting had been good, and\r\nfor a week he had eaten his fill. He was even gorged from his latest\r\nkill. But in the moment he looked at Lip-lip his hair rose on end all\r\nalong his back. It was an involuntary bristling on his part, the\r\nphysical state that in the past had always accompanied the mental state\r\nproduced in him by Lip-lip\xe2\x80\x99s bullying and persecution. As in the past\r\nhe had bristled and snarled at sight of Lip-lip, so now, and\r\nautomatically, he bristled and snarled. He did not waste any time. The\r\nthing was done thoroughly and with despatch. Lip-lip essayed to back\r\naway, but White Fang struck him hard, shoulder to shoulder. Lip-lip was\r\noverthrown and rolled upon his back. White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s teeth drove into the\r\nscrawny throat. There was a death-struggle, during which White Fang\r\nwalked around, stiff-legged and observant. Then he resumed his course\r\nand trotted on along the base of the bluff.\r\n\r\nOne day, not long after, he came to the edge of the forest, where a\r\nnarrow stretch of open land sloped down to the Mackenzie. He had been\r\nover this ground before, when it was bare, but now a village occupied\r\nit. Still hidden amongst the trees, he paused to study the situation.\r\nSights and sounds and scents were familiar to him. It was the old\r\nvillage changed to a new place. But sights and sounds and smells were\r\ndifferent from those he had last had when he fled away from it. There\r\nwas no whimpering nor wailing. Contented sounds saluted his ear, and\r\nwhen he heard the angry voice of a woman he knew it to be the anger\r\nthat proceeds from a full stomach. And there was a smell in the air of\r\nfish. There was food. The famine was gone. He came out boldly from the\r\nforest and trotted into camp straight to Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s tepee. Grey\r\nBeaver was not there; but Kloo-kooch welcomed him with glad cries and\r\nthe whole of a fresh-caught fish, and he lay down to wait Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE ENEMY OF HIS KIND\r\n\r\n\r\nHad there been in White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s nature any possibility, no matter how\r\nremote, of his ever coming to fraternise with his kind, such\r\npossibility was irretrievably destroyed when he was made leader of the\r\nsled-team. For now the dogs hated him\xe2\x80\x94hated him for the extra meat\r\nbestowed upon him by Mit-sah; hated him for all the real and fancied\r\nfavours he received; hated him for that he fled always at the head of\r\nthe team, his waving brush of a tail and his perpetually retreating\r\nhind-quarters for ever maddening their eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd White Fang just as bitterly hated them back. Being sled-leader was\r\nanything but gratifying to him. To be compelled to run away before the\r\nyelling pack, every dog of which, for three years, he had thrashed and\r\nmastered, was almost more than he could endure. But endure it he must,\r\nor perish, and the life that was in him had no desire to perish out.\r\nThe moment Mit-sah gave his order for the start, that moment the whole\r\nteam, with eager, savage cries, sprang forward at White Fang.\r\n\r\nThere was no defence for him. If he turned upon them, Mit-sah would\r\nthrow the stinging lash of the whip into his face. Only remained to him\r\nto run away. He could not encounter that howling horde with his tail\r\nand hind-quarters. These were scarcely fit weapons with which to meet\r\nthe many merciless fangs. So run away he did, violating his own nature\r\nand pride with every leap he made, and leaping all day long.\r\n\r\nOne cannot violate the promptings of one\xe2\x80\x99s nature without having that\r\nnature recoil upon itself. Such a recoil is like that of a hair, made\r\nto grow out from the body, turning unnaturally upon the direction of\r\nits growth and growing into the body\xe2\x80\x94a rankling, festering thing of\r\nhurt. And so with White Fang. Every urge of his being impelled him to\r\nspring upon the pack that cried at his heels, but it was the will of\r\nthe gods that this should not be; and behind the will, to enforce it,\r\nwas the whip of cariboo-gut with its biting thirty-foot lash. So White\r\nFang could only eat his heart in bitterness and develop a hatred and\r\nmalice commensurate with the ferocity and indomitability of his nature.\r\n\r\nIf ever a creature was the enemy of its kind, White Fang was that\r\ncreature. He asked no quarter, gave none. He was continually marred and\r\nscarred by the teeth of the pack, and as continually he left his own\r\nmarks upon the pack. Unlike most leaders, who, when camp was made and\r\nthe dogs were unhitched, huddled near to the gods for protection, White\r\nFang disdained such protection. He walked boldly about the camp,\r\ninflicting punishment in the night for what he had suffered in the day.\r\nIn the time before he was made leader of the team, the pack had learned\r\nto get out of his way. But now it was different. Excited by the\r\nday-long pursuit of him, swayed subconsciously by the insistent\r\niteration on their brains of the sight of him fleeing away, mastered by\r\nthe feeling of mastery enjoyed all day, the dogs could not bring\r\nthemselves to give way to him. When he appeared amongst them, there was\r\nalways a squabble. His progress was marked by snarl and snap and growl.\r\nThe very atmosphere he breathed was surcharged with hatred and malice,\r\nand this but served to increase the hatred and malice within him.\r\n\r\nWhen Mit-sah cried out his command for the team to stop, White Fang\r\nobeyed. At first this caused trouble for the other dogs. All of them\r\nwould spring upon the hated leader only to find the tables turned.\r\nBehind him would be Mit-sah, the great whip singing in his hand. So the\r\ndogs came to understand that when the team stopped by order, White Fang\r\nwas to be let alone. But when White Fang stopped without orders, then\r\nit was allowed them to spring upon him and destroy him if they could.\r\nAfter several experiences, White Fang never stopped without orders. He\r\nlearned quickly. It was in the nature of things, that he must learn\r\nquickly if he were to survive the unusually severe conditions under\r\nwhich life was vouchsafed him.\r\n\r\nBut the dogs could never learn the lesson to leave him alone in camp.\r\nEach day, pursuing him and crying defiance at him, the lesson of the\r\nprevious night was erased, and that night would have to be learned over\r\nagain, to be as immediately forgotten. Besides, there was a greater\r\nconsistence in their dislike of him. They sensed between themselves and\r\nhim a difference of kind\xe2\x80\x94cause sufficient in itself for hostility. Like\r\nhim, they were domesticated wolves. But they had been domesticated for\r\ngenerations. Much of the Wild had been lost, so that to them the Wild\r\nwas the unknown, the terrible, the ever-menacing and ever warring. But\r\nto him, in appearance and action and impulse, still clung the Wild. He\r\nsymbolised it, was its personification: so that when they showed their\r\nteeth to him they were defending themselves against the powers of\r\ndestruction that lurked in the shadows of the forest and in the dark\r\nbeyond the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nBut there was one lesson the dogs did learn, and that was to keep\r\ntogether. White Fang was too terrible for any of them to face\r\nsingle-handed. They met him with the mass-formation, otherwise he would\r\nhave killed them, one by one, in a night. As it was, he never had a\r\nchance to kill them. He might roll a dog off its feet, but the pack\r\nwould be upon him before he could follow up and deliver the deadly\r\nthroat-stroke. At the first hint of conflict, the whole team drew\r\ntogether and faced him. The dogs had quarrels among themselves, but\r\nthese were forgotten when trouble was brewing with White Fang.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, try as they would, they could not kill White Fang.\r\nHe was too quick for them, too formidable, too wise. He avoided tight\r\nplaces and always backed out of it when they bade fair to surround him.\r\nWhile, as for getting him off his feet, there was no dog among them\r\ncapable of doing the trick. His feet clung to the earth with the same\r\ntenacity that he clung to life. For that matter, life and footing were\r\nsynonymous in this unending warfare with the pack, and none knew it\r\nbetter than White Fang.\r\n\r\nSo he became the enemy of his kind, domesticated wolves that they were,\r\nsoftened by the fires of man, weakened in the sheltering shadow of\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s strength. White Fang was bitter and implacable. The clay of him\r\nwas so moulded. He declared a vendetta against all dogs. And so\r\nterribly did he live this vendetta that Grey Beaver, fierce savage\r\nhimself, could not but marvel at White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s ferocity. Never, he\r\nswore, had there been the like of this animal; and the Indians in\r\nstrange villages swore likewise when they considered the tale of his\r\nkillings amongst their dogs.\r\n\r\nWhen White Fang was nearly five years old, Grey Beaver took him on\r\nanother great journey, and long remembered was the havoc he worked\r\namongst the dogs of the many villages along the Mackenzie, across the\r\nRockies, and down the Porcupine to the Yukon. He revelled in the\r\nvengeance he wreaked upon his kind. They were ordinary, unsuspecting\r\ndogs. They were not prepared for his swiftness and directness, for his\r\nattack without warning. They did not know him for what he was, a\r\nlightning-flash of slaughter. They bristled up to him, stiff-legged and\r\nchallenging, while he, wasting no time on elaborate preliminaries,\r\nsnapping into action like a steel spring, was at their throats and\r\ndestroying them before they knew what was happening and while they were\r\nyet in the throes of surprise.\r\n\r\nHe became an adept at fighting. He economised. He never wasted his\r\nstrength, never tussled. He was in too quickly for that, and, if he\r\nmissed, was out again too quickly. The dislike of the wolf for close\r\nquarters was his to an unusual degree. He could not endure a prolonged\r\ncontact with another body. It smacked of danger. It made him frantic.\r\nHe must be away, free, on his own legs, touching no living thing. It\r\nwas the Wild still clinging to him, asserting itself through him. This\r\nfeeling had been accentuated by the Ishmaelite life he had led from his\r\npuppyhood. Danger lurked in contacts. It was the trap, ever the trap,\r\nthe fear of it lurking deep in the life of him, woven into the fibre of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, the strange dogs he encountered had no chance against\r\nhim. He eluded their fangs. He got them, or got away, himself untouched\r\nin either event. In the natural course of things there were exceptions\r\nto this. There were times when several dogs, pitching on to him,\r\npunished him before he could get away; and there were times when a\r\nsingle dog scored deeply on him. But these were accidents. In the main,\r\nso efficient a fighter had he become, he went his way unscathed.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage he possessed was that of correctly judging time and\r\ndistance. Not that he did this consciously, however. He did not\r\ncalculate such things. It was all automatic. His eyes saw correctly,\r\nand the nerves carried the vision correctly to his brain. The parts of\r\nhim were better adjusted than those of the average dog. They worked\r\ntogether more smoothly and steadily. His was a better, far better,\r\nnervous, mental, and muscular co-ordination. When his eyes conveyed to\r\nhis brain the moving image of an action, his brain without conscious\r\neffort, knew the space that limited that action and the time required\r\nfor its completion. Thus, he could avoid the leap of another dog, or\r\nthe drive of its fangs, and at the same moment could seize the\r\ninfinitesimal fraction of time in which to deliver his own attack. Body\r\nand brain, his was a more perfected mechanism. Not that he was to be\r\npraised for it. Nature had been more generous to him than to the\r\naverage animal, that was all.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer that White Fang arrived at Fort Yukon. Grey Beaver\r\nhad crossed the great watershed between Mackenzie and the Yukon in the\r\nlate winter, and spent the spring in hunting among the western outlying\r\nspurs of the Rockies. Then, after the break-up of the ice on the\r\nPorcupine, he had built a canoe and paddled down that stream to where\r\nit effected its junction with the Yukon just under the Artic circle.\r\nHere stood the old Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Company fort; and here were many\r\nIndians, much food, and unprecedented excitement. It was the summer of\r\n1898, and thousands of gold-hunters were going up the Yukon to Dawson\r\nand the Klondike. Still hundreds of miles from their goal, nevertheless\r\nmany of them had been on the way for a year, and the least any of them\r\nhad travelled to get that far was five thousand miles, while some had\r\ncome from the other side of the world.\r\n\r\nHere Grey Beaver stopped. A whisper of the gold-rush had reached his\r\nears, and he had come with several bales of furs, and another of\r\ngut-sewn mittens and moccasins. He would not have ventured so long a\r\ntrip had he not expected generous profits. But what he had expected was\r\nnothing to what he realised. His wildest dreams had not exceeded a\r\nhundred per cent. profit; he made a thousand per cent. And like a true\r\nIndian, he settled down to trade carefully and slowly, even if it took\r\nall summer and the rest of the winter to dispose of his goods.\r\n\r\nIt was at Fort Yukon that White Fang saw his first white men. As\r\ncompared with the Indians he had known, they were to him another race\r\nof beings, a race of superior gods. They impressed him as possessing\r\nsuperior power, and it is on power that godhead rests. White Fang did\r\nnot reason it out, did not in his mind make the sharp generalisation\r\nthat the white gods were more powerful. It was a feeling, nothing more,\r\nand yet none the less potent. As, in his puppyhood, the looming bulks\r\nof the tepees, man-reared, had affected him as manifestations of power,\r\nso was he affected now by the houses and the huge fort all of massive\r\nlogs. Here was power. Those white gods were strong. They possessed\r\ngreater mastery over matter than the gods he had known, most powerful\r\namong which was Grey Beaver. And yet Grey Beaver was as a child-god\r\namong these white-skinned ones.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, White Fang only felt these things. He was not conscious of\r\nthem. Yet it is upon feeling, more often than thinking, that animals\r\nact; and every act White Fang now performed was based upon the feeling\r\nthat the white men were the superior gods. In the first place he was\r\nvery suspicious of them. There was no telling what unknown terrors were\r\ntheirs, what unknown hurts they could administer. He was curious to\r\nobserve them, fearful of being noticed by them. For the first few hours\r\nhe was content with slinking around and watching them from a safe\r\ndistance. Then he saw that no harm befell the dogs that were near to\r\nthem, and he came in closer.\r\n\r\nIn turn he was an object of great curiosity to them. His wolfish\r\nappearance caught their eyes at once, and they pointed him out to one\r\nanother. This act of pointing put White Fang on his guard, and when\r\nthey tried to approach him he showed his teeth and backed away. Not one\r\nsucceeded in laying a hand on him, and it was well that they did not.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang soon learned that very few of these gods\xe2\x80\x94not more than a\r\ndozen\xe2\x80\x94lived at this place. Every two or three days a steamer (another\r\nand colossal manifestation of power) came into the bank and stopped for\r\nseveral hours. The white men came from off these steamers and went away\r\non them again. There seemed untold numbers of these white men. In the\r\nfirst day or so, he saw more of them than he had seen Indians in all\r\nhis life; and as the days went by they continued to come up the river,\r\nstop, and then go on up the river out of sight.\r\n\r\nBut if the white gods were all-powerful, their dogs did not amount to\r\nmuch. This White Fang quickly discovered by mixing with those that came\r\nashore with their masters. They were irregular shapes and sizes. Some\r\nwere short-legged\xe2\x80\x94too short; others were long-legged\xe2\x80\x94too long. They had\r\nhair instead of fur, and a few had very little hair at that. And none\r\nof them knew how to fight.\r\n\r\nAs an enemy of his kind, it was in White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s province to fight with\r\nthem. This he did, and he quickly achieved for them a mighty contempt.\r\nThey were soft and helpless, made much noise, and floundered around\r\nclumsily trying to accomplish by main strength what he accomplished by\r\ndexterity and cunning. They rushed bellowing at him. He sprang to the\r\nside. They did not know what had become of him; and in that moment he\r\nstruck them on the shoulder, rolling them off their feet and delivering\r\nhis stroke at the throat.\r\n\r\nSometimes this stroke was successful, and a stricken dog rolled in the\r\ndirt, to be pounced upon and torn to pieces by the pack of Indian dogs\r\nthat waited. White Fang was wise. He had long since learned that the\r\ngods were made angry when their dogs were killed. The white men were no\r\nexception to this. So he was content, when he had overthrown and\r\nslashed wide the throat of one of their dogs, to drop back and let the\r\npack go in and do the cruel finishing work. It was then that the white\r\nmen rushed in, visiting their wrath heavily on the pack, while White\r\nFang went free. He would stand off at a little distance and look on,\r\nwhile stones, clubs, axes, and all sorts of weapons fell upon his\r\nfellows. White Fang was very wise.\r\n\r\nBut his fellows grew wise in their own way; and in this White Fang grew\r\nwise with them. They learned that it was when a steamer first tied to\r\nthe bank that they had their fun. After the first two or three strange\r\ndogs had been downed and destroyed, the white men hustled their own\r\nanimals back on board and wrecked savage vengeance on the offenders.\r\nOne white man, having seen his dog, a setter, torn to pieces before his\r\neyes, drew a revolver. He fired rapidly, six times, and six of the pack\r\nlay dead or dying\xe2\x80\x94another manifestation of power that sank deep into\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang enjoyed it all. He did not love his kind, and he was shrewd\r\nenough to escape hurt himself. At first, the killing of the white men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndogs had been a diversion. After a time it became his occupation. There\r\nwas no work for him to do. Grey Beaver was busy trading and getting\r\nwealthy. So White Fang hung around the landing with the disreputable\r\ngang of Indian dogs, waiting for steamers. With the arrival of a\r\nsteamer the fun began. After a few minutes, by the time the white men\r\nhad got over their surprise, the gang scattered. The fun was over until\r\nthe next steamer should arrive.\r\n\r\nBut it can scarcely be said that White Fang was a member of the gang.\r\nHe did not mingle with it, but remained aloof, always himself, and was\r\neven feared by it. It is true, he worked with it. He picked the quarrel\r\nwith the strange dog while the gang waited. And when he had overthrown\r\nthe strange dog the gang went in to finish it. But it is equally true\r\nthat he then withdrew, leaving the gang to receive the punishment of\r\nthe outraged gods.\r\n\r\nIt did not require much exertion to pick these quarrels. All he had to\r\ndo, when the strange dogs came ashore, was to show himself. When they\r\nsaw him they rushed for him. It was their instinct. He was the Wild\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nunknown, the terrible, the ever-menacing, the thing that prowled in the\r\ndarkness around the fires of the primeval world when they, cowering\r\nclose to the fires, were reshaping their instincts, learning to fear\r\nthe Wild out of which they had come, and which they had deserted and\r\nbetrayed. Generation by generation, down all the generations, had this\r\nfear of the Wild been stamped into their natures. For centuries the\r\nWild had stood for terror and destruction. And during all this time\r\nfree licence had been theirs, from their masters, to kill the things of\r\nthe Wild. In doing this they had protected both themselves and the gods\r\nwhose companionship they shared.\r\n\r\nAnd so, fresh from the soft southern world, these dogs, trotting down\r\nthe gang-plank and out upon the Yukon shore had but to see White Fang\r\nto experience the irresistible impulse to rush upon him and destroy\r\nhim. They might be town-reared dogs, but the instinctive fear of the\r\nWild was theirs just the same. Not alone with their own eyes did they\r\nsee the wolfish creature in the clear light of day, standing before\r\nthem. They saw him with the eyes of their ancestors, and by their\r\ninherited memory they knew White Fang for the wolf, and they remembered\r\nthe ancient feud.\r\n\r\nAll of which served to make White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s days enjoyable. If the sight\r\nof him drove these strange dogs upon him, so much the better for him,\r\nso much the worse for them. They looked upon him as legitimate prey,\r\nand as legitimate prey he looked upon them.\r\n\r\nNot for nothing had he first seen the light of day in a lonely lair and\r\nfought his first fights with the ptarmigan, the weasel, and the lynx.\r\nAnd not for nothing had his puppyhood been made bitter by the\r\npersecution of Lip-lip and the whole puppy pack. It might have been\r\notherwise, and he would then have been otherwise. Had Lip-lip not\r\nexisted, he would have passed his puppyhood with the other puppies and\r\ngrown up more doglike and with more liking for dogs. Had Grey Beaver\r\npossessed the plummet of affection and love, he might have sounded the\r\ndeeps of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s nature and brought up to the surface all manner\r\nof kindly qualities. But these things had not been so. The clay of\r\nWhite Fang had been moulded until he became what he was, morose and\r\nlonely, unloving and ferocious, the enemy of all his kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE MAD GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nA small number of white men lived in Fort Yukon. These men had been\r\nlong in the country. They called themselves Sour-doughs, and took great\r\npride in so classifying themselves. For other men, new in the land,\r\nthey felt nothing but disdain. The men who came ashore from the\r\nsteamers were newcomers. They were known as _chechaquos_, and they\r\nalways wilted at the application of the name. They made their bread\r\nwith baking-powder. This was the invidious distinction between them and\r\nthe Sour-doughs, who, forsooth, made their bread from sour-dough\r\nbecause they had no baking-powder.\r\n\r\nAll of which is neither here nor there. The men in the fort disdained\r\nthe newcomers and enjoyed seeing them come to grief. Especially did\r\nthey enjoy the havoc worked amongst the newcomers\xe2\x80\x99 dogs by White Fang\r\nand his disreputable gang. When a steamer arrived, the men of the fort\r\nmade it a point always to come down to the bank and see the fun. They\r\nlooked forward to it with as much anticipation as did the Indian dogs,\r\nwhile they were not slow to appreciate the savage and crafty part\r\nplayed by White Fang.\r\n\r\nBut there was one man amongst them who particularly enjoyed the sport.\r\nHe would come running at the first sound of a steamboat\xe2\x80\x99s whistle; and\r\nwhen the last fight was over and White Fang and the pack had scattered,\r\nhe would return slowly to the fort, his face heavy with regret.\r\nSometimes, when a soft southland dog went down, shrieking its death-cry\r\nunder the fangs of the pack, this man would be unable to contain\r\nhimself, and would leap into the air and cry out with delight. And\r\nalways he had a sharp and covetous eye for White Fang.\r\n\r\nThis man was called \xe2\x80\x9cBeauty\xe2\x80\x9d by the other men of the fort. No one knew\r\nhis first name, and in general he was known in the country as Beauty\r\nSmith. But he was anything save a beauty. To antithesis was due his\r\nnaming. He was pre-eminently unbeautiful. Nature had been niggardly\r\nwith him. He was a small man to begin with; and upon his meagre frame\r\nwas deposited an even more strikingly meagre head. Its apex might be\r\nlikened to a point. In fact, in his boyhood, before he had been named\r\nBeauty by his fellows, he had been called \xe2\x80\x9cPinhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBackward, from the apex, his head slanted down to his neck and forward\r\nit slanted uncompromisingly to meet a low and remarkably wide forehead.\r\nBeginning here, as though regretting her parsimony, Nature had spread\r\nhis features with a lavish hand. His eyes were large, and between them\r\nwas the distance of two eyes. His face, in relation to the rest of him,\r\nwas prodigious. In order to discover the necessary area, Nature had\r\ngiven him an enormous prognathous jaw. It was wide and heavy, and\r\nprotruded outward and down until it seemed to rest on his chest.\r\nPossibly this appearance was due to the weariness of the slender neck,\r\nunable properly to support so great a burden.\r\n\r\nThis jaw gave the impression of ferocious determination. But something\r\nlacked. Perhaps it was from excess. Perhaps the jaw was too large. At\r\nany rate, it was a lie. Beauty Smith was known far and wide as the\r\nweakest of weak-kneed and snivelling cowards. To complete his\r\ndescription, his teeth were large and yellow, while the two eye-teeth,\r\nlarger than their fellows, showed under his lean lips like fangs. His\r\neyes were yellow and muddy, as though Nature had run short on pigments\r\nand squeezed together the dregs of all her tubes. It was the same with\r\nhis hair, sparse and irregular of growth, muddy-yellow and\r\ndirty-yellow, rising on his head and sprouting out of his face in\r\nunexpected tufts and bunches, in appearance like clumped and wind-blown\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nIn short, Beauty Smith was a monstrosity, and the blame of it lay\r\nelsewhere. He was not responsible. The clay of him had been so moulded\r\nin the making. He did the cooking for the other men in the fort, the\r\ndish-washing and the drudgery. They did not despise him. Rather did\r\nthey tolerate him in a broad human way, as one tolerates any creature\r\nevilly treated in the making. Also, they feared him. His cowardly rages\r\nmade them dread a shot in the back or poison in their coffee. But\r\nsomebody had to do the cooking, and whatever else his shortcomings,\r\nBeauty Smith could cook.\r\n\r\nThis was the man that looked at White Fang, delighted in his ferocious\r\nprowess, and desired to possess him. He made overtures to White Fang\r\nfrom the first. White Fang began by ignoring him. Later on, when the\r\novertures became more insistent, White Fang bristled and bared his\r\nteeth and backed away. He did not like the man. The feel of him was\r\nbad. He sensed the evil in him, and feared the extended hand and the\r\nattempts at soft-spoken speech. Because of all this, he hated the man.\r\n\r\nWith the simpler creatures, good and bad are things simply understood.\r\nThe good stands for all things that bring easement and satisfaction and\r\nsurcease from pain. Therefore, the good is liked. The bad stands for\r\nall things that are fraught with discomfort, menace, and hurt, and is\r\nhated accordingly. White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s feel of Beauty Smith was bad. From the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s distorted body and twisted mind, in occult ways, like mists\r\nrising from malarial marshes, came emanations of the unhealth within.\r\nNot by reasoning, not by the five senses alone, but by other and\r\nremoter and uncharted senses, came the feeling to White Fang that the\r\nman was ominous with evil, pregnant with hurtfulness, and therefore a\r\nthing bad, and wisely to be hated.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang was in Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s camp when Beauty Smith first visited\r\nit. At the faint sound of his distant feet, before he came in sight,\r\nWhite Fang knew who was coming and began to bristle. He had been lying\r\ndown in an abandon of comfort, but he arose quickly, and, as the man\r\narrived, slid away in true wolf-fashion to the edge of the camp. He did\r\nnot know what they said, but he could see the man and Grey Beaver\r\ntalking together. Once, the man pointed at him, and White Fang snarled\r\nback as though the hand were just descending upon him instead of being,\r\nas it was, fifty feet away. The man laughed at this; and White Fang\r\nslunk away to the sheltering woods, his head turned to observe as he\r\nglided softly over the ground.\r\n\r\nGrey Beaver refused to sell the dog. He had grown rich with his trading\r\nand stood in need of nothing. Besides, White Fang was a valuable\r\nanimal, the strongest sled-dog he had ever owned, and the best leader.\r\nFurthermore, there was no dog like him on the Mackenzie nor the Yukon.\r\nHe could fight. He killed other dogs as easily as men killed\r\nmosquitoes. (Beauty Smith\xe2\x80\x99s eyes lighted up at this, and he licked his\r\nthin lips with an eager tongue). No, White Fang was not for sale at any\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nBut Beauty Smith knew the ways of Indians. He visited Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncamp often, and hidden under his coat was always a black bottle or so.\r\nOne of the potencies of whisky is the breeding of thirst. Grey Beaver\r\ngot the thirst. His fevered membranes and burnt stomach began to\r\nclamour for more and more of the scorching fluid; while his brain,\r\nthrust all awry by the unwonted stimulant, permitted him to go any\r\nlength to obtain it. The money he had received for his furs and mittens\r\nand moccasins began to go. It went faster and faster, and the shorter\r\nhis money-sack grew, the shorter grew his temper.\r\n\r\nIn the end his money and goods and temper were all gone. Nothing\r\nremained to him but his thirst, a prodigious possession in itself that\r\ngrew more prodigious with every sober breath he drew. Then it was that\r\nBeauty Smith had talk with him again about the sale of White Fang; but\r\nthis time the price offered was in bottles, not dollars, and Grey\r\nBeaver\xe2\x80\x99s ears were more eager to hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ketch um dog you take um all right,\xe2\x80\x9d was his last word.\r\n\r\nThe bottles were delivered, but after two days. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ketch um dog,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwere Beauty Smith\xe2\x80\x99s words to Grey Beaver.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang slunk into camp one evening and dropped down with a sigh of\r\ncontent. The dreaded white god was not there. For days his\r\nmanifestations of desire to lay hands on him had been growing more\r\ninsistent, and during that time White Fang had been compelled to avoid\r\nthe camp. He did not know what evil was threatened by those insistent\r\nhands. He knew only that they did threaten evil of some sort, and that\r\nit was best for him to keep out of their reach.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had he lain down when Grey Beaver staggered over to him\r\nand tied a leather thong around his neck. He sat down beside White\r\nFang, holding the end of the thong in his hand. In the other hand he\r\nheld a bottle, which, from time to time, was inverted above his head to\r\nthe accompaniment of gurgling noises.\r\n\r\nAn hour of this passed, when the vibrations of feet in contact with the\r\nground foreran the one who approached. White Fang heard it first, and\r\nhe was bristling with recognition while Grey Beaver still nodded\r\nstupidly. White Fang tried to draw the thong softly out of his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand; but the relaxed fingers closed tightly and Grey Beaver roused\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBeauty Smith strode into camp and stood over White Fang. He snarled\r\nsoftly up at the thing of fear, watching keenly the deportment of the\r\nhands. One hand extended outward and began to descend upon his head.\r\nHis soft snarl grew tense and harsh. The hand continued slowly to\r\ndescend, while he crouched beneath it, eyeing it malignantly, his snarl\r\ngrowing shorter and shorter as, with quickening breath, it approached\r\nits culmination. Suddenly he snapped, striking with his fangs like a\r\nsnake. The hand was jerked back, and the teeth came together emptily\r\nwith a sharp click. Beauty Smith was frightened and angry. Grey Beaver\r\nclouted White Fang alongside the head, so that he cowered down close to\r\nthe earth in respectful obedience.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s suspicious eyes followed every movement. He saw Beauty\r\nSmith go away and return with a stout club. Then the end of the thong\r\nwas given over to him by Grey Beaver. Beauty Smith started to walk\r\naway. The thong grew taut. White Fang resisted it. Grey Beaver clouted\r\nhim right and left to make him get up and follow. He obeyed, but with a\r\nrush, hurling himself upon the stranger who was dragging him away.\r\nBeauty Smith did not jump away. He had been waiting for this. He swung\r\nthe club smartly, stopping the rush midway and smashing White Fang down\r\nupon the ground. Grey Beaver laughed and nodded approval. Beauty Smith\r\ntightened the thong again, and White Fang crawled limply and dizzily to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nHe did not rush a second time. One smash from the club was sufficient\r\nto convince him that the white god knew how to handle it, and he was\r\ntoo wise to fight the inevitable. So he followed morosely at Beauty\r\nSmith\xe2\x80\x99s heels, his tail between his legs, yet snarling softly under his\r\nbreath. But Beauty Smith kept a wary eye on him, and the club was held\r\nalways ready to strike.\r\n\r\nAt the fort Beauty Smith left him securely tied and went in to bed.\r\nWhite Fang waited an hour. Then he applied his teeth to the thong, and\r\nin the space of ten seconds was free. He had wasted no time with his\r\nteeth. There had been no useless gnawing. The thong was cut across,\r\ndiagonally, almost as clean as though done by a knife. White Fang\r\nlooked up at the fort, at the same time bristling and growling. Then he\r\nturned and trotted back to Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s camp. He owed no allegiance to\r\nthis strange and terrible god. He had given himself to Grey Beaver, and\r\nto Grey Beaver he considered he still belonged.\r\n\r\nBut what had occurred before was repeated\xe2\x80\x94with a difference. Grey\r\nBeaver again made him fast with a thong, and in the morning turned him\r\nover to Beauty Smith. And here was where the difference came in. Beauty\r\nSmith gave him a beating. Tied securely, White Fang could only rage\r\nfutilely and endure the punishment. Club and whip were both used upon\r\nhim, and he experienced the worst beating he had ever received in his\r\nlife. Even the big beating given him in his puppyhood by Grey Beaver\r\nwas mild compared with this.\r\n\r\nBeauty Smith enjoyed the task. He delighted in it. He gloated over his\r\nvictim, and his eyes flamed dully, as he swung the whip or club and\r\nlistened to White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s cries of pain and to his helpless bellows and\r\nsnarls. For Beauty Smith was cruel in the way that cowards are cruel.\r\nCringing and snivelling himself before the blows or angry speech of a\r\nman, he revenged himself, in turn, upon creatures weaker than he. All\r\nlife likes power, and Beauty Smith was no exception. Denied the\r\nexpression of power amongst his own kind, he fell back upon the lesser\r\ncreatures and there vindicated the life that was in him. But Beauty\r\nSmith had not created himself, and no blame was to be attached to him.\r\nHe had come into the world with a twisted body and a brute\r\nintelligence. This had constituted the clay of him, and it had not been\r\nkindly moulded by the world.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang knew why he was being beaten. When Grey Beaver tied the\r\nthong around his neck, and passed the end of the thong into Beauty\r\nSmith\xe2\x80\x99s keeping, White Fang knew that it was his god\xe2\x80\x99s will for him to\r\ngo with Beauty Smith. And when Beauty Smith left him tied outside the\r\nfort, he knew that it was Beauty Smith\xe2\x80\x99s will that he should remain\r\nthere. Therefore, he had disobeyed the will of both the gods, and\r\nearned the consequent punishment. He had seen dogs change owners in the\r\npast, and he had seen the runaways beaten as he was being beaten. He\r\nwas wise, and yet in the nature of him there were forces greater than\r\nwisdom. One of these was fidelity. He did not love Grey Beaver, yet,\r\neven in the face of his will and his anger, he was faithful to him. He\r\ncould not help it. This faithfulness was a quality of the clay that\r\ncomposed him. It was the quality that was peculiarly the possession of\r\nhis kind; the quality that set apart his species from all other\r\nspecies; the quality that has enabled the wolf and the wild dog to come\r\nin from the open and be the companions of man.\r\n\r\nAfter the beating, White Fang was dragged back to the fort. But this\r\ntime Beauty Smith left him tied with a stick. One does not give up a\r\ngod easily, and so with White Fang. Grey Beaver was his own particular\r\ngod, and, in spite of Grey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s will, White Fang still clung to him\r\nand would not give him up. Grey Beaver had betrayed and forsaken him,\r\nbut that had no effect upon him. Not for nothing had he surrendered\r\nhimself body and soul to Grey Beaver. There had been no reservation on\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s part, and the bond was not to be broken easily.\r\n\r\nSo, in the night, when the men in the fort were asleep, White Fang\r\napplied his teeth to the stick that held him. The wood was seasoned and\r\ndry, and it was tied so closely to his neck that he could scarcely get\r\nhis teeth to it. It was only by the severest muscular exertion and\r\nneck-arching that he succeeded in getting the wood between his teeth,\r\nand barely between his teeth at that; and it was only by the exercise\r\nof an immense patience, extending through many hours, that he succeeded\r\nin gnawing through the stick. This was something that dogs were not\r\nsupposed to do. It was unprecedented. But White Fang did it, trotting\r\naway from the fort in the early morning, with the end of the stick\r\nhanging to his neck.\r\n\r\nHe was wise. But had he been merely wise he would not have gone back to\r\nGrey Beaver who had already twice betrayed him. But there was his\r\nfaithfulness, and he went back to be betrayed yet a third time. Again\r\nhe yielded to the tying of a thong around his neck by Grey Beaver, and\r\nagain Beauty Smith came to claim him. And this time he was beaten even\r\nmore severely than before.\r\n\r\nGrey Beaver looked on stolidly while the white man wielded the whip. He\r\ngave no protection. It was no longer his dog. When the beating was over\r\nWhite Fang was sick. A soft southland dog would have died under it, but\r\nnot he. His school of life had been sterner, and he was himself of\r\nsterner stuff. He had too great vitality. His clutch on life was too\r\nstrong. But he was very sick. At first he was unable to drag himself\r\nalong, and Beauty Smith had to wait half-an-hour for him. And then,\r\nblind and reeling, he followed at Beauty Smith\xe2\x80\x99s heels back to the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nBut now he was tied with a chain that defied his teeth, and he strove\r\nin vain, by lunging, to draw the staple from the timber into which it\r\nwas driven. After a few days, sober and bankrupt, Grey Beaver departed\r\nup the Porcupine on his long journey to the Mackenzie. White Fang\r\nremained on the Yukon, the property of a man more than half mad and all\r\nbrute. But what is a dog to know in its consciousness of madness? To\r\nWhite Fang, Beauty Smith was a veritable, if terrible, god. He was a\r\nmad god at best, but White Fang knew nothing of madness; he knew only\r\nthat he must submit to the will of this new master, obey his every whim\r\nand fancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE REIGN OF HATE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the tutelage of the mad god, White Fang became a fiend. He was\r\nkept chained in a pen at the rear of the fort, and here Beauty Smith\r\nteased and irritated and drove him wild with petty torments. The man\r\nearly discovered White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility to laughter, and made it a\r\npoint after painfully tricking him, to laugh at him. This laughter was\r\nuproarious and scornful, and at the same time the god pointed his\r\nfinger derisively at White Fang. At such times reason fled from White\r\nFang, and in his transports of rage he was even more mad than Beauty\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nFormerly, White Fang had been merely the enemy of his kind, withal a\r\nferocious enemy. He now became the enemy of all things, and more\r\nferocious than ever. To such an extent was he tormented, that he hated\r\nblindly and without the faintest spark of reason. He hated the chain\r\nthat bound him, the men who peered in at him through the slats of the\r\npen, the dogs that accompanied the men and that snarled malignantly at\r\nhim in his helplessness. He hated the very wood of the pen that\r\nconfined him. And, first, last, and most of all, he hated Beauty Smith.\r\n\r\nBut Beauty Smith had a purpose in all that he did to White Fang. One\r\nday a number of men gathered about the pen. Beauty Smith entered, club\r\nin hand, and took the chain off from White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s neck. When his master\r\nhad gone out, White Fang turned loose and tore around the pen, trying\r\nto get at the men outside. He was magnificently terrible. Fully five\r\nfeet in length, and standing two and one-half feet at the shoulder, he\r\nfar outweighed a wolf of corresponding size. From his mother he had\r\ninherited the heavier proportions of the dog, so that he weighed,\r\nwithout any fat and without an ounce of superfluous flesh, over ninety\r\npounds. It was all muscle, bone, and sinew-fighting flesh in the finest\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe door of the pen was being opened again. White Fang paused.\r\nSomething unusual was happening. He waited. The door was opened wider.\r\nThen a huge dog was thrust inside, and the door was slammed shut behind\r\nhim. White Fang had never seen such a dog (it was a mastiff); but the\r\nsize and fierce aspect of the intruder did not deter him. Here was some\r\nthing, not wood nor iron, upon which to wreak his hate. He leaped in\r\nwith a flash of fangs that ripped down the side of the mastiff\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\nThe mastiff shook his head, growled hoarsely, and plunged at White\r\nFang. But White Fang was here, there, and everywhere, always evading\r\nand eluding, and always leaping in and slashing with his fangs and\r\nleaping out again in time to escape punishment.\r\n\r\nThe men outside shouted and applauded, while Beauty Smith, in an\r\necstasy of delight, gloated over the ripping and mangling performed by\r\nWhite Fang. There was no hope for the mastiff from the first. He was\r\ntoo ponderous and slow. In the end, while Beauty Smith beat White Fang\r\nback with a club, the mastiff was dragged out by its owner. Then there\r\nwas a payment of bets, and money clinked in Beauty Smith\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang came to look forward eagerly to the gathering of the men\r\naround his pen. It meant a fight; and this was the only way that was\r\nnow vouchsafed him of expressing the life that was in him. Tormented,\r\nincited to hate, he was kept a prisoner so that there was no way of\r\nsatisfying that hate except at the times his master saw fit to put\r\nanother dog against him. Beauty Smith had estimated his powers well,\r\nfor he was invariably the victor. One day, three dogs were turned in\r\nupon him in succession. Another day a full-grown wolf, fresh-caught\r\nfrom the Wild, was shoved in through the door of the pen. And on still\r\nanother day two dogs were set against him at the same time. This was\r\nhis severest fight, and though in the end he killed them both he was\r\nhimself half killed in doing it.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the year, when the first snows were falling and mush-ice\r\nwas running in the river, Beauty Smith took passage for himself and\r\nWhite Fang on a steamboat bound up the Yukon to Dawson. White Fang had\r\nnow achieved a reputation in the land. As \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fighting Wolf\xe2\x80\x9d he was\r\nknown far and wide, and the cage in which he was kept on the\r\nsteam-boat\xe2\x80\x99s deck was usually surrounded by curious men. He raged and\r\nsnarled at them, or lay quietly and studied them with cold hatred. Why\r\nshould he not hate them? He never asked himself the question. He knew\r\nonly hate and lost himself in the passion of it. Life had become a hell\r\nto him. He had not been made for the close confinement wild beasts\r\nendure at the hands of men. And yet it was in precisely this way that\r\nhe was treated. Men stared at him, poked sticks between the bars to\r\nmake him snarl, and then laughed at him.\r\n\r\nThey were his environment, these men, and they were moulding the clay\r\nof him into a more ferocious thing than had been intended by Nature.\r\nNevertheless, Nature had given him plasticity. Where many another\r\nanimal would have died or had its spirit broken, he adjusted himself\r\nand lived, and at no expense of the spirit. Possibly Beauty Smith,\r\narch-fiend and tormentor, was capable of breaking White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s spirit,\r\nbut as yet there were no signs of his succeeding.\r\n\r\nIf Beauty Smith had in him a devil, White Fang had another; and the two\r\nof them raged against each other unceasingly. In the days before, White\r\nFang had had the wisdom to cower down and submit to a man with a club\r\nin his hand; but this wisdom now left him. The mere sight of Beauty\r\nSmith was sufficient to send him into transports of fury. And when they\r\ncame to close quarters, and he had been beaten back by the club, he\r\nwent on growling and snarling, and showing his fangs. The last growl\r\ncould never be extracted from him. No matter how terribly he was\r\nbeaten, he had always another growl; and when Beauty Smith gave up and\r\nwithdrew, the defiant growl followed after him, or White Fang sprang at\r\nthe bars of the cage bellowing his hatred.\r\n\r\nWhen the steamboat arrived at Dawson, White Fang went ashore. But he\r\nstill lived a public life, in a cage, surrounded by curious men. He was\r\nexhibited as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fighting Wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d and men paid fifty cents in gold dust\r\nto see him. He was given no rest. Did he lie down to sleep, he was\r\nstirred up by a sharp stick\xe2\x80\x94so that the audience might get its money\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworth. In order to make the exhibition interesting, he was kept in a\r\nrage most of the time. But worse than all this, was the atmosphere in\r\nwhich he lived. He was regarded as the most fearful of wild beasts, and\r\nthis was borne in to him through the bars of the cage. Every word,\r\nevery cautious action, on the part of the men, impressed upon him his\r\nown terrible ferocity. It was so much added fuel to the flame of his\r\nfierceness. There could be but one result, and that was that his\r\nferocity fed upon itself and increased. It was another instance of the\r\nplasticity of his clay, of his capacity for being moulded by the\r\npressure of environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being exhibited he was a professional fighting animal.\r\nAt irregular intervals, whenever a fight could be arranged, he was\r\ntaken out of his cage and led off into the woods a few miles from town.\r\nUsually this occurred at night, so as to avoid interference from the\r\nmounted police of the Territory. After a few hours of waiting, when\r\ndaylight had come, the audience and the dog with which he was to fight\r\narrived. In this manner it came about that he fought all sizes and\r\nbreeds of dogs. It was a savage land, the men were savage, and the\r\nfights were usually to the death.\r\n\r\nSince White Fang continued to fight, it is obvious that it was the\r\nother dogs that died. He never knew defeat. His early training, when he\r\nfought with Lip-lip and the whole puppy-pack, stood him in good stead.\r\nThere was the tenacity with which he clung to the earth. No dog could\r\nmake him lose his footing. This was the favourite trick of the wolf\r\nbreeds\xe2\x80\x94to rush in upon him, either directly or with an unexpected\r\nswerve, in the hope of striking his shoulder and overthrowing him.\r\nMackenzie hounds, Eskimo and Labrador dogs, huskies and Malemutes\xe2\x80\x94all\r\ntried it on him, and all failed. He was never known to lose his\r\nfooting. Men told this to one another, and looked each time to see it\r\nhappen; but White Fang always disappointed them.\r\n\r\nThen there was his lightning quickness. It gave him a tremendous\r\nadvantage over his antagonists. No matter what their fighting\r\nexperience, they had never encountered a dog that moved so swiftly as\r\nhe. Also to be reckoned with, was the immediateness of his attack. The\r\naverage dog was accustomed to the preliminaries of snarling and\r\nbristling and growling, and the average dog was knocked off his feet\r\nand finished before he had begun to fight or recovered from his\r\nsurprise. So often did this happen, that it became the custom to hold\r\nWhite Fang until the other dog went through its preliminaries, was good\r\nand ready, and even made the first attack.\r\n\r\nBut greatest of all the advantages in White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s favour, was his\r\nexperience. He knew more about fighting than did any of the dogs that\r\nfaced him. He had fought more fights, knew how to meet more tricks and\r\nmethods, and had more tricks himself, while his own method was scarcely\r\nto be improved upon.\r\n\r\nAs the time went by, he had fewer and fewer fights. Men despaired of\r\nmatching him with an equal, and Beauty Smith was compelled to pit\r\nwolves against him. These were trapped by the Indians for the purpose,\r\nand a fight between White Fang and a wolf was always sure to draw a\r\ncrowd. Once, a full-grown female lynx was secured, and this time White\r\nFang fought for his life. Her quickness matched his; her ferocity\r\nequalled his; while he fought with his fangs alone, and she fought with\r\nher sharp-clawed feet as well.\r\n\r\nBut after the lynx, all fighting ceased for White Fang. There were no\r\nmore animals with which to fight\xe2\x80\x94at least, there was none considered\r\nworthy of fighting with him. So he remained on exhibition until spring,\r\nwhen one Tim Keenan, a faro-dealer, arrived in the land. With him came\r\nthe first bull-dog that had ever entered the Klondike. That this dog\r\nand White Fang should come together was inevitable, and for a week the\r\nanticipated fight was the mainspring of conversation in certain\r\nquarters of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE CLINGING DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nBeauty Smith slipped the chain from his neck and stepped back.\r\n\r\nFor once White Fang did not make an immediate attack. He stood still,\r\nears pricked forward, alert and curious, surveying the strange animal\r\nthat faced him. He had never seen such a dog before. Tim Keenan shoved\r\nthe bull-dog forward with a muttered \xe2\x80\x9cGo to it.\xe2\x80\x9d The animal waddled\r\ntoward the centre of the circle, short and squat and ungainly. He came\r\nto a stop and blinked across at White Fang.\r\n\r\nThere were cries from the crowd of, \xe2\x80\x9cGo to him, Cherokee! Sick \xe2\x80\x99m,\r\nCherokee! Eat \xe2\x80\x99m up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Cherokee did not seem anxious to fight. He turned his head and\r\nblinked at the men who shouted, at the same time wagging his stump of a\r\ntail good-naturedly. He was not afraid, but merely lazy. Besides, it\r\ndid not seem to him that it was intended he should fight with the dog\r\nhe saw before him. He was not used to fighting with that kind of dog,\r\nand he was waiting for them to bring on the real dog.\r\n\r\nTim Keenan stepped in and bent over Cherokee, fondling him on both\r\nsides of the shoulders with hands that rubbed against the grain of the\r\nhair and that made slight, pushing-forward movements. These were so\r\nmany suggestions. Also, their effect was irritating, for Cherokee began\r\nto growl, very softly, deep down in his throat. There was a\r\ncorrespondence in rhythm between the growls and the movements of the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s hands. The growl rose in the throat with the culmination of each\r\nforward-pushing movement, and ebbed down to start up afresh with the\r\nbeginning of the next movement. The end of each movement was the accent\r\nof the rhythm, the movement ending abruptly and the growling rising\r\nwith a jerk.\r\n\r\nThis was not without its effect on White Fang. The hair began to rise\r\non his neck and across the shoulders. Tim Keenan gave a final shove\r\nforward and stepped back again. As the impetus that carried Cherokee\r\nforward died down, he continued to go forward of his own volition, in a\r\nswift, bow-legged run. Then White Fang struck. A cry of startled\r\nadmiration went up. He had covered the distance and gone in more like a\r\ncat than a dog; and with the same cat-like swiftness he had slashed\r\nwith his fangs and leaped clear.\r\n\r\nThe bull-dog was bleeding back of one ear from a rip in his thick neck.\r\nHe gave no sign, did not even snarl, but turned and followed after\r\nWhite Fang. The display on both sides, the quickness of the one and the\r\nsteadiness of the other, had excited the partisan spirit of the crowd,\r\nand the men were making new bets and increasing original bets. Again,\r\nand yet again, White Fang sprang in, slashed, and got away untouched,\r\nand still his strange foe followed after him, without too great haste,\r\nnot slowly, but deliberately and determinedly, in a businesslike sort\r\nof way. There was purpose in his method\xe2\x80\x94something for him to do that he\r\nwas intent upon doing and from which nothing could distract him.\r\n\r\nHis whole demeanour, every action, was stamped with this purpose. It\r\npuzzled White Fang. Never had he seen such a dog. It had no hair\r\nprotection. It was soft, and bled easily. There was no thick mat of fur\r\nto baffle White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s teeth as they were often baffled by dogs of his\r\nown breed. Each time that his teeth struck they sank easily into the\r\nyielding flesh, while the animal did not seem able to defend itself.\r\nAnother disconcerting thing was that it made no outcry, such as he had\r\nbeen accustomed to with the other dogs he had fought. Beyond a growl or\r\na grunt, the dog took its punishment silently. And never did it flag in\r\nits pursuit of him.\r\n\r\nNot that Cherokee was slow. He could turn and whirl swiftly enough, but\r\nWhite Fang was never there. Cherokee was puzzled, too. He had never\r\nfought before with a dog with which he could not close. The desire to\r\nclose had always been mutual. But here was a dog that kept at a\r\ndistance, dancing and dodging here and there and all about. And when it\r\ndid get its teeth into him, it did not hold on but let go instantly and\r\ndarted away again.\r\n\r\nBut White Fang could not get at the soft underside of the throat. The\r\nbull-dog stood too short, while its massive jaws were an added\r\nprotection. White Fang darted in and out unscathed, while Cherokee\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwounds increased. Both sides of his neck and head were ripped and\r\nslashed. He bled freely, but showed no signs of being disconcerted. He\r\ncontinued his plodding pursuit, though once, for the moment baffled, he\r\ncame to a full stop and blinked at the men who looked on, at the same\r\ntime wagging his stump of a tail as an expression of his willingness to\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nIn that moment White Fang was in upon him and out, in passing ripping\r\nhis trimmed remnant of an ear. With a slight manifestation of anger,\r\nCherokee took up the pursuit again, running on the inside of the circle\r\nWhite Fang was making, and striving to fasten his deadly grip on White\r\nFang\xe2\x80\x99s throat. The bull-dog missed by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth, and cries of\r\npraise went up as White Fang doubled suddenly out of danger in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe time went by. White Fang still danced on, dodging and doubling,\r\nleaping in and out, and ever inflicting damage. And still the bull-dog,\r\nwith grim certitude, toiled after him. Sooner or later he would\r\naccomplish his purpose, get the grip that would win the battle. In the\r\nmeantime, he accepted all the punishment the other could deal him. His\r\ntufts of ears had become tassels, his neck and shoulders were slashed\r\nin a score of places, and his very lips were cut and bleeding\xe2\x80\x94all from\r\nthese lightning snaps that were beyond his foreseeing and guarding.\r\n\r\nTime and again White Fang had attempted to knock Cherokee off his feet;\r\nbut the difference in their height was too great. Cherokee was too\r\nsquat, too close to the ground. White Fang tried the trick once too\r\noften. The chance came in one of his quick doublings and\r\ncounter-circlings. He caught Cherokee with head turned away as he\r\nwhirled more slowly. His shoulder was exposed. White Fang drove in upon\r\nit: but his own shoulder was high above, while he struck with such\r\nforce that his momentum carried him on across over the other\xe2\x80\x99s body.\r\nFor the first time in his fighting history, men saw White Fang lose his\r\nfooting. His body turned a half-somersault in the air, and he would\r\nhave landed on his back had he not twisted, catlike, still in the air,\r\nin the effort to bring his feet to the earth. As it was, he struck\r\nheavily on his side. The next instant he was on his feet, but in that\r\ninstant Cherokee\xe2\x80\x99s teeth closed on his throat.\r\n\r\nIt was not a good grip, being too low down toward the chest; but\r\nCherokee held on. White Fang sprang to his feet and tore wildly around,\r\ntrying to shake off the bull-dog\xe2\x80\x99s body. It made him frantic, this\r\nclinging, dragging weight. It bound his movements, restricted his\r\nfreedom. It was like the trap, and all his instinct resented it and\r\nrevolted against it. It was a mad revolt. For several minutes he was to\r\nall intents insane. The basic life that was in him took charge of him.\r\nThe will to exist of his body surged over him. He was dominated by this\r\nmere flesh-love of life. All intelligence was gone. It was as though he\r\nhad no brain. His reason was unseated by the blind yearning of the\r\nflesh to exist and move, at all hazards to move, to continue to move,\r\nfor movement was the expression of its existence.\r\n\r\nRound and round he went, whirling and turning and reversing, trying to\r\nshake off the fifty-pound weight that dragged at his throat. The\r\nbull-dog did little but keep his grip. Sometimes, and rarely, he\r\nmanaged to get his feet to the earth and for a moment to brace himself\r\nagainst White Fang. But the next moment his footing would be lost and\r\nhe would be dragging around in the whirl of one of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s mad\r\ngyrations. Cherokee identified himself with his instinct. He knew that\r\nhe was doing the right thing by holding on, and there came to him\r\ncertain blissful thrills of satisfaction. At such moments he even\r\nclosed his eyes and allowed his body to be hurled hither and thither,\r\nwilly-nilly, careless of any hurt that might thereby come to it. That\r\ndid not count. The grip was the thing, and the grip he kept.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang ceased only when he had tired himself out. He could do\r\nnothing, and he could not understand. Never, in all his fighting, had\r\nthis thing happened. The dogs he had fought with did not fight that\r\nway. With them it was snap and slash and get away, snap and slash and\r\nget away. He lay partly on his side, panting for breath. Cherokee still\r\nholding his grip, urged against him, trying to get him over entirely on\r\nhis side. White Fang resisted, and he could feel the jaws shifting\r\ntheir grip, slightly relaxing and coming together again in a chewing\r\nmovement. Each shift brought the grip closer to his throat. The\r\nbull-dog\xe2\x80\x99s method was to hold what he had, and when opportunity\r\nfavoured to work in for more. Opportunity favoured when White Fang\r\nremained quiet. When White Fang struggled, Cherokee was content merely\r\nto hold on.\r\n\r\nThe bulging back of Cherokee\xe2\x80\x99s neck was the only portion of his body\r\nthat White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s teeth could reach. He got hold toward the base where\r\nthe neck comes out from the shoulders; but he did not know the chewing\r\nmethod of fighting, nor were his jaws adapted to it. He spasmodically\r\nripped and tore with his fangs for a space. Then a change in their\r\nposition diverted him. The bull-dog had managed to roll him over on his\r\nback, and still hanging on to his throat, was on top of him. Like a\r\ncat, White Fang bowed his hind-quarters in, and, with the feet digging\r\ninto his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s abdomen above him, he began to claw with long\r\ntearing-strokes. Cherokee might well have been disembowelled had he not\r\nquickly pivoted on his grip and got his body off of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s and at\r\nright angles to it.\r\n\r\nThere was no escaping that grip. It was like Fate itself, and as\r\ninexorable. Slowly it shifted up along the jugular. All that saved\r\nWhite Fang from death was the loose skin of his neck and the thick fur\r\nthat covered it. This served to form a large roll in Cherokee\xe2\x80\x99s mouth,\r\nthe fur of which well-nigh defied his teeth. But bit by bit, whenever\r\nthe chance offered, he was getting more of the loose skin and fur in\r\nhis mouth. The result was that he was slowly throttling White Fang. The\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s breath was drawn with greater and greater difficulty as the\r\nmoments went by.\r\n\r\nIt began to look as though the battle were over. The backers of\r\nCherokee waxed jubilant and offered ridiculous odds. White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbackers were correspondingly depressed, and refused bets of ten to one\r\nand twenty to one, though one man was rash enough to close a wager of\r\nfifty to one. This man was Beauty Smith. He took a step into the ring\r\nand pointed his finger at White Fang. Then he began to laugh derisively\r\nand scornfully. This produced the desired effect. White Fang went wild\r\nwith rage. He called up his reserves of strength, and gained his feet.\r\nAs he struggled around the ring, the fifty pounds of his foe ever\r\ndragging on his throat, his anger passed on into panic. The basic life\r\nof him dominated him again, and his intelligence fled before the will\r\nof his flesh to live. Round and round and back again, stumbling and\r\nfalling and rising, even uprearing at times on his hind-legs and\r\nlifting his foe clear of the earth, he struggled vainly to shake off\r\nthe clinging death.\r\n\r\nAt last he fell, toppling backward, exhausted; and the bull-dog\r\npromptly shifted his grip, getting in closer, mangling more and more of\r\nthe fur-folded flesh, throttling White Fang more severely than ever.\r\nShouts of applause went up for the victor, and there were many cries of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCherokee!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCherokee!\xe2\x80\x9d To this Cherokee responded by vigorous wagging\r\nof the stump of his tail. But the clamour of approval did not distract\r\nhim. There was no sympathetic relation between his tail and his massive\r\njaws. The one might wag, but the others held their terrible grip on\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s throat.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that a diversion came to the spectators. There was\r\na jingle of bells. Dog-mushers\xe2\x80\x99 cries were heard. Everybody, save\r\nBeauty Smith, looked apprehensively, the fear of the police strong upon\r\nthem. But they saw, up the trail, and not down, two men running with\r\nsled and dogs. They were evidently coming down the creek from some\r\nprospecting trip. At sight of the crowd they stopped their dogs and\r\ncame over and joined it, curious to see the cause of the excitement.\r\nThe dog-musher wore a moustache, but the other, a taller and younger\r\nman, was smooth-shaven, his skin rosy from the pounding of his blood\r\nand the running in the frosty air.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang had practically ceased struggling. Now and again he resisted\r\nspasmodically and to no purpose. He could get little air, and that\r\nlittle grew less and less under the merciless grip that ever tightened.\r\nIn spite of his armour of fur, the great vein of his throat would have\r\nlong since been torn open, had not the first grip of the bull-dog been\r\nso low down as to be practically on the chest. It had taken Cherokee a\r\nlong time to shift that grip upward, and this had also tended further\r\nto clog his jaws with fur and skin-fold.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the abysmal brute in Beauty Smith had been rising into\r\nhis brain and mastering the small bit of sanity that he possessed at\r\nbest. When he saw White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s eyes beginning to glaze, he knew beyond\r\ndoubt that the fight was lost. Then he broke loose. He sprang upon\r\nWhite Fang and began savagely to kick him. There were hisses from the\r\ncrowd and cries of protest, but that was all. While this went on, and\r\nBeauty Smith continued to kick White Fang, there was a commotion in the\r\ncrowd. The tall young newcomer was forcing his way through, shouldering\r\nmen right and left without ceremony or gentleness. When he broke\r\nthrough into the ring, Beauty Smith was just in the act of delivering\r\nanother kick. All his weight was on one foot, and he was in a state of\r\nunstable equilibrium. At that moment the newcomer\xe2\x80\x99s fist landed a\r\nsmashing blow full in his face. Beauty Smith\xe2\x80\x99s remaining leg left the\r\nground, and his whole body seemed to lift into the air as he turned\r\nover backward and struck the snow. The newcomer turned upon the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cowards!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou beasts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was in a rage himself\xe2\x80\x94a sane rage. His grey eyes seemed metallic and\r\nsteel-like as they flashed upon the crowd. Beauty Smith regained his\r\nfeet and came toward him, sniffling and cowardly. The new-comer did not\r\nunderstand. He did not know how abject a coward the other was, and\r\nthought he was coming back intent on fighting. So, with a \xe2\x80\x9cYou beast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe smashed Beauty Smith over backward with a second blow in the face.\r\nBeauty Smith decided that the snow was the safest place for him, and\r\nlay where he had fallen, making no effort to get up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Matt, lend a hand,\xe2\x80\x9d the newcomer called the dog-musher, who\r\nhad followed him into the ring.\r\n\r\nBoth men bent over the dogs. Matt took hold of White Fang, ready to\r\npull when Cherokee\xe2\x80\x99s jaws should be loosened. This the younger man\r\nendeavoured to accomplish by clutching the bulldog\xe2\x80\x99s jaws in his hands\r\nand trying to spread them. It was a vain undertaking. As he pulled and\r\ntugged and wrenched, he kept exclaiming with every expulsion of breath,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeasts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd began to grow unruly, and some of the men were protesting\r\nagainst the spoiling of the sport; but they were silenced when the\r\nnewcomer lifted his head from his work for a moment and glared at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou damn beasts!\xe2\x80\x9d he finally exploded, and went back to his task.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use, Mr. Scott, you can\xe2\x80\x99t break \xe2\x80\x99m apart that way,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt said\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nThe pair paused and surveyed the locked dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t bleedin\xe2\x80\x99 much,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt announced. \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t got all the way in yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s liable to any moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, did you see\r\nthat! He shifted his grip in a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe younger man\xe2\x80\x99s excitement and apprehension for White Fang was\r\ngrowing. He struck Cherokee about the head savagely again and again.\r\nBut that did not loosen the jaws. Cherokee wagged the stump of his tail\r\nin advertisement that he understood the meaning of the blows, but that\r\nhe knew he was himself in the right and only doing his duty by keeping\r\nhis grip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t some of you help?\xe2\x80\x9d Scott cried desperately at the crowd.\r\n\r\nBut no help was offered. Instead, the crowd began sarcastically to\r\ncheer him on and showered him with facetious advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get a pry,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt counselled.\r\n\r\nThe other reached into the holster at his hip, drew his revolver, and\r\ntried to thrust its muzzle between the bull-dog\xe2\x80\x99s jaws. He shoved, and\r\nshoved hard, till the grating of the steel against the locked teeth\r\ncould be distinctly heard. Both men were on their knees, bending over\r\nthe dogs. Tim Keenan strode into the ring. He paused beside Scott and\r\ntouched him on the shoulder, saying ominously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t break them teeth, stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll break his neck,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott retorted, continuing his shoving and\r\nwedging with the revolver muzzle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said don\xe2\x80\x99t break them teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d the faro-dealer repeated more\r\nominously than before.\r\n\r\nBut if it was a bluff he intended, it did not work. Scott never\r\ndesisted from his efforts, though he looked up coolly and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe faro-dealer grunted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen get in here and break this grip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d the other drawled irritatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling\r\nyou that\xe2\x80\x99s something I ain\xe2\x80\x99t worked out for myself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to\r\nturn the trick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen get out of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbusy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTim Keenan continued standing over him, but Scott took no further\r\nnotice of his presence. He had managed to get the muzzle in between the\r\njaws on one side, and was trying to get it out between the jaws on the\r\nother side. This accomplished, he pried gently and carefully, loosening\r\nthe jaws a bit at a time, while Matt, a bit at a time, extricated White\r\nFang\xe2\x80\x99s mangled neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by to receive your dog,\xe2\x80\x9d was Scott\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory order to\r\nCherokee\xe2\x80\x99s owner.\r\n\r\nThe faro-dealer stooped down obediently and got a firm hold on\r\nCherokee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d Scott warned, giving the final pry.\r\n\r\nThe dogs were drawn apart, the bull-dog struggling vigorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him away,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott commanded, and Tim Keenan dragged Cherokee back\r\ninto the crowd.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang made several ineffectual efforts to get up. Once he gained\r\nhis feet, but his legs were too weak to sustain him, and he slowly\r\nwilted and sank back into the snow. His eyes were half closed, and the\r\nsurface of them was glassy. His jaws were apart, and through them the\r\ntongue protruded, draggled and limp. To all appearances he looked like\r\na dog that had been strangled to death. Matt examined him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust about all in,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s breathin\xe2\x80\x99 all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeauty Smith had regained his feet and come over to look at White Fang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatt, how much is a good sled-dog worth?\xe2\x80\x9d Scott asked.\r\n\r\nThe dog-musher, still on his knees and stooped over White Fang,\r\ncalculated for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much for one that\xe2\x80\x99s all chewed up like this one?\xe2\x80\x9d Scott asked,\r\nnudging White Fang with his foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf of that,\xe2\x80\x9d was the dog-musher\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. Scott turned upon Beauty\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear, Mr. Beast? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take your dog from you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to give you a hundred and fifty for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened his pocket-book and counted out the bills.\r\n\r\nBeauty Smith put his hands behind his back, refusing to touch the\r\nproffered money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-sellin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes you are,\xe2\x80\x9d the other assured him. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m buying. Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour money. The dog\xe2\x80\x99s mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeauty Smith, his hands still behind him, began to back away.\r\n\r\nScott sprang toward him, drawing his fist back to strike. Beauty Smith\r\ncowered down in anticipation of the blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my rights,\xe2\x80\x9d he whimpered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve forfeited your rights to own that dog,\xe2\x80\x9d was the rejoinder. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou going to take the money? or do I have to hit you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Beauty Smith spoke up with the alacrity of fear. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\ntake the money under protest,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dog\xe2\x80\x99s a mint. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be robbed. A man\xe2\x80\x99s got his rights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorrect,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott answered, passing the money over to him. \xe2\x80\x9cA man\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nhis rights. But you\xe2\x80\x99re not a man. You\xe2\x80\x99re a beast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till I get back to Dawson,\xe2\x80\x9d Beauty Smith threatened. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nthe law on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you open your mouth when you get back to Dawson, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you run\r\nout of town. Understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeauty Smith replied with a grunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d the other thundered with abrupt fierceness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Beauty Smith grunted, shrinking away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Beauty Smith snarled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out! He\xe2\x80\x99ll bite!\xe2\x80\x9d some one shouted, and a guffaw of laughter went\r\nup.\r\n\r\nScott turned his back on him, and returned to help the dog-musher, who\r\nwas working over White Fang.\r\n\r\nSome of the men were already departing; others stood in groups, looking\r\non and talking. Tim Keenan joined one of the groups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that mug?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeedon Scott,\xe2\x80\x9d some one answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who in hell is Weedon Scott?\xe2\x80\x9d the faro-dealer demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, one of them crackerjack minin\xe2\x80\x99 experts. He\xe2\x80\x99s in with all the big\r\nbugs. If you want to keep out of trouble, you\xe2\x80\x99ll steer clear of him,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s my talk. He\xe2\x80\x99s all hunky with the officials. The Gold\r\nCommissioner\xe2\x80\x99s a special pal of his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he must be somebody,\xe2\x80\x9d was the faro-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s comment. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhy I kept my hands offen him at the start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE INDOMITABLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hopeless,\xe2\x80\x9d Weedon Scott confessed.\r\n\r\nHe sat on the step of his cabin and stared at the dog-musher, who\r\nresponded with a shrug that was equally hopeless.\r\n\r\nTogether they looked at White Fang at the end of his stretched chain,\r\nbristling, snarling, ferocious, straining to get at the sled-dogs.\r\nHaving received sundry lessons from Matt, said lessons being imparted\r\nby means of a club, the sled-dogs had learned to leave White Fang\r\nalone; and even then they were lying down at a distance, apparently\r\noblivious of his existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wolf and there\xe2\x80\x99s no taming it,\xe2\x80\x9d Weedon Scott announced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt objected. \xe2\x80\x9cMight be a lot of dog in\r\n\xe2\x80\x99m, for all you can tell. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I know sure, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no gettin\xe2\x80\x99 away from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dog-musher paused and nodded his head confidentially at Moosehide\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a miser with what you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott said sharply, after\r\nwaiting a suitable length of time. \xe2\x80\x9cSpit it out. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dog-musher indicated White Fang with a backward thrust of his\r\nthumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWolf or dog, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s ben tamed \xe2\x80\x99ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you yes, an\xe2\x80\x99 broke to harness. Look close there. D\xe2\x80\x99ye see them\r\nmarks across the chest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, Matt. He was a sled-dog before Beauty Smith got hold of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s not much reason against his bein\xe2\x80\x99 a sled-dog again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99ye think?\xe2\x80\x9d Scott queried eagerly. Then the hope died down as he\r\nadded, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had him two weeks now, and if anything\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s wilder than ever at the present moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive \xe2\x80\x99m a chance,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt counselled. \xe2\x80\x9cTurn \xe2\x80\x99m loose for a spell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other looked at him incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a\r\nclub.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou try it then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dog-musher secured a club and went over to the chained animal.\r\nWhite Fang watched the club after the manner of a caged lion watching\r\nthe whip of its trainer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee \xe2\x80\x99m keep his eye on that club,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s no fool. Don\xe2\x80\x99t dast tackle me so long as I got that club handy.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s not clean crazy, sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the man\xe2\x80\x99s hand approached his neck, White Fang bristled and snarled\r\nand crouched down. But while he eyed the approaching hand, he at the\r\nsame time contrived to keep track of the club in the other hand,\r\nsuspended threateningly above him. Matt unsnapped the chain from the\r\ncollar and stepped back.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang could scarcely realise that he was free. Many months had\r\ngone by since he passed into the possession of Beauty Smith, and in all\r\nthat period he had never known a moment of freedom except at the times\r\nhe had been loosed to fight with other dogs. Immediately after such\r\nfights he had always been imprisoned again.\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to make of it. Perhaps some new devilry of the\r\ngods was about to be perpetrated on him. He walked slowly and\r\ncautiously, prepared to be assailed at any moment. He did not know what\r\nto do, it was all so unprecedented. He took the precaution to sheer off\r\nfrom the two watching gods, and walked carefully to the corner of the\r\ncabin. Nothing happened. He was plainly perplexed, and he came back\r\nagain, pausing a dozen feet away and regarding the two men intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t he run away?\xe2\x80\x9d his new owner asked.\r\n\r\nMatt shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cGot to take a gamble. Only way to find\r\nout is to find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor devil,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott murmured pityingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat he needs is some show of\r\nhuman kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning and going into the cabin.\r\n\r\nHe came out with a piece of meat, which he tossed to White Fang. He\r\nsprang away from it, and from a distance studied it suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi-yu, Major!\xe2\x80\x9d Matt shouted warningly, but too late.\r\n\r\nMajor had made a spring for the meat. At the instant his jaws closed on\r\nit, White Fang struck him. He was overthrown. Matt rushed in, but\r\nquicker than he was White Fang. Major staggered to his feet, but the\r\nblood spouting from his throat reddened the snow in a widening path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too bad, but it served him right,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott said hastily.\r\n\r\nBut Matt\xe2\x80\x99s foot had already started on its way to kick White Fang.\r\nThere was a leap, a flash of teeth, a sharp exclamation. White Fang,\r\nsnarling fiercely, scrambled backward for several yards, while Matt\r\nstooped and investigated his leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got me all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, pointing to the torn trousers and\r\nundercloths, and the growing stain of red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you it was hopeless, Matt,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott said in a discouraged voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about it off and on, while not wanting to think of it.\r\nBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to it now. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he talked, with reluctant movements he drew his revolver, threw open\r\nthe cylinder, and assured himself of its contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Mr. Scott,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt objected; \xe2\x80\x9cthat dog\xe2\x80\x99s ben through hell.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t expect \xe2\x80\x99m to come out a white an\xe2\x80\x99 shinin\xe2\x80\x99 angel. Give \xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Major,\xe2\x80\x9d the other rejoined.\r\n\r\nThe dog-musher surveyed the stricken dog. He had sunk down on the snow\r\nin the circle of his blood and was plainly in the last gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServed \xe2\x80\x99m right. You said so yourself, Mr. Scott. He tried to take\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s meat, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s dead-O. That was to be expected. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive two whoops in hell for a dog that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fight for his own\r\nmeat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look at yourself, Matt. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right about the dogs, but we must\r\ndraw the line somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServed me right,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt argued stubbornly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99d I want to kick \xe2\x80\x99m\r\nfor? You said yourself that he\xe2\x80\x99d done right. Then I had no right to\r\nkick \xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a mercy to kill him,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s untamable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, Mr. Scott, give the poor devil a fightin\xe2\x80\x99 chance. He\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t had no chance yet. He\xe2\x80\x99s just come through hell, an\xe2\x80\x99 this is the\r\nfirst time he\xe2\x80\x99s ben loose. Give \xe2\x80\x99m a fair chance, an\xe2\x80\x99 if he don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeliver the goods, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill \xe2\x80\x99m myself. There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to kill him or have him killed,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott\r\nanswered, putting away the revolver. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll let him run loose and see\r\nwhat kindness can do for him. And here\xe2\x80\x99s a try at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked over to White Fang and began talking to him gently and\r\nsoothingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter have a club handy,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt warned.\r\n\r\nScott shook his head and went on trying to win White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s confidence.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang was suspicious. Something was impending. He had killed this\r\ngod\xe2\x80\x99s dog, bitten his companion god, and what else was to be expected\r\nthan some terrible punishment? But in the face of it he was\r\nindomitable. He bristled and showed his teeth, his eyes vigilant, his\r\nwhole body wary and prepared for anything. The god had no club, so he\r\nsuffered him to approach quite near. The god\xe2\x80\x99s hand had come out and\r\nwas descending upon his head. White Fang shrank together and grew tense\r\nas he crouched under it. Here was danger, some treachery or something.\r\nHe knew the hands of the gods, their proved mastery, their cunning to\r\nhurt. Besides, there was his old antipathy to being touched. He snarled\r\nmore menacingly, crouched still lower, and still the hand descended. He\r\ndid not want to bite the hand, and he endured the peril of it until his\r\ninstinct surged up in him, mastering him with its insatiable yearning\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott had believed that he was quick enough to avoid any snap or\r\nslash. But he had yet to learn the remarkable quickness of White Fang,\r\nwho struck with the certainty and swiftness of a coiled snake.\r\n\r\nScott cried out sharply with surprise, catching his torn hand and\r\nholding it tightly in his other hand. Matt uttered a great oath and\r\nsprang to his side. White Fang crouched down, and backed away,\r\nbristling, showing his fangs, his eyes malignant with menace. Now he\r\ncould expect a beating as fearful as any he had received from Beauty\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Scott cried suddenly.\r\n\r\nMatt had dashed into the cabin and come out with a rifle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, with a careless calmness that was assumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9conly goin\xe2\x80\x99 to keep that promise I made. I reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s up to me to kill\r\n\xe2\x80\x99m as I said I\xe2\x80\x99d do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I do. Watch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Matt had pleaded for White Fang when he had been bitten, it was now\r\nWeedon Scott\xe2\x80\x99s turn to plead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said to give him a chance. Well, give it to him. We\xe2\x80\x99ve only just\r\nstarted, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t quit at the beginning. It served me right, this\r\ntime. And\xe2\x80\x94look at him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang, near the corner of the cabin and forty feet away, was\r\nsnarling with blood-curdling viciousness, not at Scott, but at the\r\ndog-musher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be everlastingly gosh-swoggled!\xe2\x80\x9d was the dog-musher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpression of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the intelligence of him,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott went on hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows the\r\nmeaning of firearms as well as you do. He\xe2\x80\x99s got intelligence and we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to give that intelligence a chance. Put up the gun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99m willin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt agreed, leaning the rifle against the\r\nwoodpile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will you look at that!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed the next moment.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang had quieted down and ceased snarling. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is worth\r\ninvestigatin\xe2\x80\x99. Watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatt, reached for the rifle, and at the same moment White Fang snarled.\r\nHe stepped away from the rifle, and White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s lifted lips descended,\r\ncovering his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, just for fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatt took the rifle and began slowly to raise it to his shoulder. White\r\nFang\xe2\x80\x99s snarling began with the movement, and increased as the movement\r\napproached its culmination. But the moment before the rifle came to a\r\nlevel on him, he leaped sidewise behind the corner of the cabin. Matt\r\nstood staring along the sights at the empty space of snow which had\r\nbeen occupied by White Fang.\r\n\r\nThe dog-musher put the rifle down solemnly, then turned and looked at\r\nhis employer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you, Mr. Scott. That dog\xe2\x80\x99s too intelligent to kill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE LOVE-MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs White Fang watched Weedon Scott approach, he bristled and snarled to\r\nadvertise that he would not submit to punishment. Twenty-four hours had\r\npassed since he had slashed open the hand that was now bandaged and\r\nheld up by a sling to keep the blood out of it. In the past White Fang\r\nhad experienced delayed punishments, and he apprehended that such a one\r\nwas about to befall him. How could it be otherwise? He had committed\r\nwhat was to him sacrilege, sunk his fangs into the holy flesh of a god,\r\nand of a white-skinned superior god at that. In the nature of things,\r\nand of intercourse with gods, something terrible awaited him.\r\n\r\nThe god sat down several feet away. White Fang could see nothing\r\ndangerous in that. When the gods administered punishment they stood on\r\ntheir legs. Besides, this god had no club, no whip, no firearm. And\r\nfurthermore, he himself was free. No chain nor stick bound him. He\r\ncould escape into safety while the god was scrambling to his feet. In\r\nthe meantime he would wait and see.\r\n\r\nThe god remained quiet, made no movement; and White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s snarl slowly\r\ndwindled to a growl that ebbed down in his throat and ceased. Then the\r\ngod spoke, and at the first sound of his voice, the hair rose on White\r\nFang\xe2\x80\x99s neck and the growl rushed up in his throat. But the god made no\r\nhostile movement, and went on calmly talking. For a time White Fang\r\ngrowled in unison with him, a correspondence of rhythm being\r\nestablished between growl and voice. But the god talked on\r\ninterminably. He talked to White Fang as White Fang had never been\r\ntalked to before. He talked softly and soothingly, with a gentleness\r\nthat somehow, somewhere, touched White Fang. In spite of himself and\r\nall the pricking warnings of his instinct, White Fang began to have\r\nconfidence in this god. He had a feeling of security that was belied by\r\nall his experience with men.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time, the god got up and went into the cabin. White Fang\r\nscanned him apprehensively when he came out. He had neither whip nor\r\nclub nor weapon. Nor was his uninjured hand behind his back hiding\r\nsomething. He sat down as before, in the same spot, several feet away.\r\nHe held out a small piece of meat. White Fang pricked his ears and\r\ninvestigated it suspiciously, managing to look at the same time both at\r\nthe meat and the god, alert for any overt act, his body tense and ready\r\nto spring away at the first sign of hostility.\r\n\r\nStill the punishment delayed. The god merely held near to his nose a\r\npiece of meat. And about the meat there seemed nothing wrong. Still\r\nWhite Fang suspected; and though the meat was proffered to him with\r\nshort inviting thrusts of the hand, he refused to touch it. The gods\r\nwere all-wise, and there was no telling what masterful treachery lurked\r\nbehind that apparently harmless piece of meat. In past experience,\r\nespecially in dealing with squaws, meat and punishment had often been\r\ndisastrously related.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the god tossed the meat on the snow at White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\nHe smelled the meat carefully; but he did not look at it. While he\r\nsmelled it he kept his eyes on the god. Nothing happened. He took the\r\nmeat into his mouth and swallowed it. Still nothing happened. The god\r\nwas actually offering him another piece of meat. Again he refused to\r\ntake it from the hand, and again it was tossed to him. This was\r\nrepeated a number of times. But there came a time when the god refused\r\nto toss it. He kept it in his hand and steadfastly proffered it.\r\n\r\nThe meat was good meat, and White Fang was hungry. Bit by bit,\r\ninfinitely cautious, he approached the hand. At last the time came that\r\nhe decided to eat the meat from the hand. He never took his eyes from\r\nthe god, thrusting his head forward with ears flattened back and hair\r\ninvoluntarily rising and cresting on his neck. Also a low growl rumbled\r\nin his throat as warning that he was not to be trifled with. He ate the\r\nmeat, and nothing happened. Piece by piece, he ate all the meat, and\r\nnothing happened. Still the punishment delayed.\r\n\r\nHe licked his chops and waited. The god went on talking. In his voice\r\nwas kindness\xe2\x80\x94something of which White Fang had no experience whatever.\r\nAnd within him it aroused feelings which he had likewise never\r\nexperienced before. He was aware of a certain strange satisfaction, as\r\nthough some need were being gratified, as though some void in his being\r\nwere being filled. Then again came the prod of his instinct and the\r\nwarning of past experience. The gods were ever crafty, and they had\r\nunguessed ways of attaining their ends.\r\n\r\nAh, he had thought so! There it came now, the god\xe2\x80\x99s hand, cunning to\r\nhurt, thrusting out at him, descending upon his head. But the god went\r\non talking. His voice was soft and soothing. In spite of the menacing\r\nhand, the voice inspired confidence. And in spite of the assuring\r\nvoice, the hand inspired distrust. White Fang was torn by conflicting\r\nfeelings, impulses. It seemed he would fly to pieces, so terrible was\r\nthe control he was exerting, holding together by an unwonted indecision\r\nthe counter-forces that struggled within him for mastery.\r\n\r\nHe compromised. He snarled and bristled and flattened his ears. But he\r\nneither snapped nor sprang away. The hand descended. Nearer and nearer\r\nit came. It touched the ends of his upstanding hair. He shrank down\r\nunder it. It followed down after him, pressing more closely against\r\nhim. Shrinking, almost shivering, he still managed to hold himself\r\ntogether. It was a torment, this hand that touched him and violated his\r\ninstinct. He could not forget in a day all the evil that had been\r\nwrought him at the hands of men. But it was the will of the god, and he\r\nstrove to submit.\r\n\r\nThe hand lifted and descended again in a patting, caressing movement.\r\nThis continued, but every time the hand lifted, the hair lifted under\r\nit. And every time the hand descended, the ears flattened down and a\r\ncavernous growl surged in his throat. White Fang growled and growled\r\nwith insistent warning. By this means he announced that he was prepared\r\nto retaliate for any hurt he might receive. There was no telling when\r\nthe god\xe2\x80\x99s ulterior motive might be disclosed. At any moment that soft,\r\nconfidence-inspiring voice might break forth in a roar of wrath, that\r\ngentle and caressing hand transform itself into a vice-like grip to\r\nhold him helpless and administer punishment.\r\n\r\nBut the god talked on softly, and ever the hand rose and fell with\r\nnon-hostile pats. White Fang experienced dual feelings. It was\r\ndistasteful to his instinct. It restrained him, opposed the will of him\r\ntoward personal liberty. And yet it was not physically painful. On the\r\ncontrary, it was even pleasant, in a physical way. The patting movement\r\nslowly and carefully changed to a rubbing of the ears about their\r\nbases, and the physical pleasure even increased a little. Yet he\r\ncontinued to fear, and he stood on guard, expectant of unguessed evil,\r\nalternately suffering and enjoying as one feeling or the other came\r\nuppermost and swayed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gosh-swoggled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke Matt, coming out of the cabin, his sleeves rolled up, a pan of\r\ndirty dish-water in his hands, arrested in the act of emptying the pan\r\nby the sight of Weedon Scott patting White Fang.\r\n\r\nAt the instant his voice broke the silence, White Fang leaped back,\r\nsnarling savagely at him.\r\n\r\nMatt regarded his employer with grieved disapproval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my expressin\xe2\x80\x99 my feelin\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr. Scott, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make free\r\nto say you\xe2\x80\x99re seventeen kinds of a damn fool an\xe2\x80\x99 all of \xe2\x80\x99em different,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 then some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott smiled with a superior air, gained his feet, and walked\r\nover to White Fang. He talked soothingly to him, but not for long, then\r\nslowly put out his hand, rested it on White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s head, and resumed\r\nthe interrupted patting. White Fang endured it, keeping his eyes fixed\r\nsuspiciously, not upon the man that patted him, but upon the man that\r\nstood in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be a number one, tip-top minin\xe2\x80\x99 expert, all right all right,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe dog-musher delivered himself oracularly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you missed the chance\r\nof your life when you was a boy an\xe2\x80\x99 didn\xe2\x80\x99t run off an\xe2\x80\x99 join a circus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang snarled at the sound of his voice, but this time did not\r\nleap away from under the hand that was caressing his head and the back\r\nof his neck with long, soothing strokes.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of the end for White Fang\xe2\x80\x94the ending of the old\r\nlife and the reign of hate. A new and incomprehensibly fairer life was\r\ndawning. It required much thinking and endless patience on the part of\r\nWeedon Scott to accomplish this. And on the part of White Fang it\r\nrequired nothing less than a revolution. He had to ignore the urges and\r\npromptings of instinct and reason, defy experience, give the lie to\r\nlife itself.\r\n\r\nLife, as he had known it, not only had had no place in it for much that\r\nhe now did; but all the currents had gone counter to those to which he\r\nnow abandoned himself. In short, when all things were considered, he\r\nhad to achieve an orientation far vaster than the one he had achieved\r\nat the time he came voluntarily in from the Wild and accepted Grey\r\nBeaver as his lord. At that time he was a mere puppy, soft from the\r\nmaking, without form, ready for the thumb of circumstance to begin its\r\nwork upon him. But now it was different. The thumb of circumstance had\r\ndone its work only too well. By it he had been formed and hardened into\r\nthe Fighting Wolf, fierce and implacable, unloving and unlovable. To\r\naccomplish the change was like a reflux of being, and this when the\r\nplasticity of youth was no longer his; when the fibre of him had become\r\ntough and knotty; when the warp and the woof of him had made of him an\r\nadamantine texture, harsh and unyielding; when the face of his spirit\r\nhad become iron and all his instincts and axioms had crystallised into\r\nset rules, cautions, dislikes, and desires.\r\n\r\nYet again, in this new orientation, it was the thumb of circumstance\r\nthat pressed and prodded him, softening that which had become hard and\r\nremoulding it into fairer form. Weedon Scott was in truth this thumb.\r\nHe had gone to the roots of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s nature, and with kindness\r\ntouched to life potencies that had languished and well-nigh perished.\r\nOne such potency was _love_. It took the place of _like_, which latter\r\nhad been the highest feeling that thrilled him in his intercourse with\r\nthe gods.\r\n\r\nBut this love did not come in a day. It began with _like_ and out of it\r\nslowly developed. White Fang did not run away, though he was allowed to\r\nremain loose, because he liked this new god. This was certainly better\r\nthan the life he had lived in the cage of Beauty Smith, and it was\r\nnecessary that he should have some god. The lordship of man was a need\r\nof his nature. The seal of his dependence on man had been set upon him\r\nin that early day when he turned his back on the Wild and crawled to\r\nGrey Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s feet to receive the expected beating. This seal had been\r\nstamped upon him again, and ineradicably, on his second return from the\r\nWild, when the long famine was over and there was fish once more in the\r\nvillage of Grey Beaver.\r\n\r\nAnd so, because he needed a god and because he preferred Weedon Scott\r\nto Beauty Smith, White Fang remained. In acknowledgment of fealty, he\r\nproceeded to take upon himself the guardianship of his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproperty. He prowled about the cabin while the sled-dogs slept, and the\r\nfirst night-visitor to the cabin fought him off with a club until\r\nWeedon Scott came to the rescue. But White Fang soon learned to\r\ndifferentiate between thieves and honest men, to appraise the true\r\nvalue of step and carriage. The man who travelled, loud-stepping, the\r\ndirect line to the cabin door, he let alone\xe2\x80\x94though he watched him\r\nvigilantly until the door opened and he received the endorsement of the\r\nmaster. But the man who went softly, by circuitous ways, peering with\r\ncaution, seeking after secrecy\xe2\x80\x94that was the man who received no\r\nsuspension of judgment from White Fang, and who went away abruptly,\r\nhurriedly, and without dignity.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott had set himself the task of redeeming White Fang\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nrather, of redeeming mankind from the wrong it had done White Fang. It\r\nwas a matter of principle and conscience. He felt that the ill done\r\nWhite Fang was a debt incurred by man and that it must be paid. So he\r\nwent out of his way to be especially kind to the Fighting Wolf. Each\r\nday he made it a point to caress and pet White Fang, and to do it at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nAt first suspicious and hostile, White Fang grew to like this petting.\r\nBut there was one thing that he never outgrew\xe2\x80\x94his growling. Growl he\r\nwould, from the moment the petting began till it ended. But it was a\r\ngrowl with a new note in it. A stranger could not hear this note, and\r\nto such a stranger the growling of White Fang was an exhibition of\r\nprimordial savagery, nerve-racking and blood-curdling. But White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthroat had become harsh-fibred from the making of ferocious sounds\r\nthrough the many years since his first little rasp of anger in the lair\r\nof his cubhood, and he could not soften the sounds of that throat now\r\nto express the gentleness he felt. Nevertheless, Weedon Scott\xe2\x80\x99s ear and\r\nsympathy were fine enough to catch the new note all but drowned in the\r\nfierceness\xe2\x80\x94the note that was the faintest hint of a croon of content\r\nand that none but he could hear.\r\n\r\nAs the days went by, the evolution of _like_ into _love_ was\r\naccelerated. White Fang himself began to grow aware of it, though in\r\nhis consciousness he knew not what love was. It manifested itself to\r\nhim as a void in his being\xe2\x80\x94a hungry, aching, yearning void that\r\nclamoured to be filled. It was a pain and an unrest; and it received\r\neasement only by the touch of the new god\xe2\x80\x99s presence. At such times\r\nlove was joy to him, a wild, keen-thrilling satisfaction. But when away\r\nfrom his god, the pain and the unrest returned; the void in him sprang\r\nup and pressed against him with its emptiness, and the hunger gnawed\r\nand gnawed unceasingly.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang was in the process of finding himself. In spite of the\r\nmaturity of his years and of the savage rigidity of the mould that had\r\nformed him, his nature was undergoing an expansion. There was a\r\nburgeoning within him of strange feelings and unwonted impulses. His\r\nold code of conduct was changing. In the past he had liked comfort and\r\nsurcease from pain, disliked discomfort and pain, and he had adjusted\r\nhis actions accordingly. But now it was different. Because of this new\r\nfeeling within him, he ofttimes elected discomfort and pain for the\r\nsake of his god. Thus, in the early morning, instead of roaming and\r\nforaging, or lying in a sheltered nook, he would wait for hours on the\r\ncheerless cabin-stoop for a sight of the god\xe2\x80\x99s face. At night, when the\r\ngod returned home, White Fang would leave the warm sleeping-place he\r\nhad burrowed in the snow in order to receive the friendly snap of\r\nfingers and the word of greeting. Meat, even meat itself, he would\r\nforego to be with his god, to receive a caress from him or to accompany\r\nhim down into the town.\r\n\r\n_Like_ had been replaced by _love_. And love was the plummet dropped\r\ndown into the deeps of him where like had never gone. And responsive\r\nout of his deeps had come the new thing\xe2\x80\x94love. That which was given unto\r\nhim did he return. This was a god indeed, a love-god, a warm and\r\nradiant god, in whose light White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s nature expanded as a flower\r\nexpands under the sun.\r\n\r\nBut White Fang was not demonstrative. He was too old, too firmly\r\nmoulded, to become adept at expressing himself in new ways. He was too\r\nself-possessed, too strongly poised in his own isolation. Too long had\r\nhe cultivated reticence, aloofness, and moroseness. He had never barked\r\nin his life, and he could not now learn to bark a welcome when his god\r\napproached. He was never in the way, never extravagant nor foolish in\r\nthe expression of his love. He never ran to meet his god. He waited at\r\na distance; but he always waited, was always there. His love partook of\r\nthe nature of worship, dumb, inarticulate, a silent adoration. Only by\r\nthe steady regard of his eyes did he express his love, and by the\r\nunceasing following with his eyes of his god\xe2\x80\x99s every movement. Also, at\r\ntimes, when his god looked at him and spoke to him, he betrayed an\r\nawkward self-consciousness, caused by the struggle of his love to\r\nexpress itself and his physical inability to express it.\r\n\r\nHe learned to adjust himself in many ways to his new mode of life. It\r\nwas borne in upon him that he must let his master\xe2\x80\x99s dogs alone. Yet his\r\ndominant nature asserted itself, and he had first to thrash them into\r\nan acknowledgment of his superiority and leadership. This accomplished,\r\nhe had little trouble with them. They gave trail to him when he came\r\nand went or walked among them, and when he asserted his will they\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, he came to tolerate Matt\xe2\x80\x94as a possession of his\r\nmaster. His master rarely fed him. Matt did that, it was his business;\r\nyet White Fang divined that it was his master\xe2\x80\x99s food he ate and that it\r\nwas his master who thus fed him vicariously. Matt it was who tried to\r\nput him into the harness and make him haul sled with the other dogs.\r\nBut Matt failed. It was not until Weedon Scott put the harness on White\r\nFang and worked him, that he understood. He took it as his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill that Matt should drive him and work him just as he drove and\r\nworked his master\xe2\x80\x99s other dogs.\r\n\r\nDifferent from the Mackenzie toboggans were the Klondike sleds with\r\nrunners under them. And different was the method of driving the dogs.\r\nThere was no fan-formation of the team. The dogs worked in single file,\r\none behind another, hauling on double traces. And here, in the\r\nKlondike, the leader was indeed the leader. The wisest as well as\r\nstrongest dog was the leader, and the team obeyed him and feared him.\r\nThat White Fang should quickly gain this post was inevitable. He could\r\nnot be satisfied with less, as Matt learned after much inconvenience\r\nand trouble. White Fang picked out the post for himself, and Matt\r\nbacked his judgment with strong language after the experiment had been\r\ntried. But, though he worked in the sled in the day, White Fang did not\r\nforego the guarding of his master\xe2\x80\x99s property in the night. Thus he was\r\non duty all the time, ever vigilant and faithful, the most valuable of\r\nall the dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMakin\xe2\x80\x99 free to spit out what\xe2\x80\x99s in me,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt said one day, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg to\r\nstate that you was a wise guy all right when you paid the price you did\r\nfor that dog. You clean swindled Beauty Smith on top of pushin\xe2\x80\x99 his\r\nface in with your fist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA recrudescence of anger glinted in Weedon Scott\xe2\x80\x99s grey eyes, and he\r\nmuttered savagely, \xe2\x80\x9cThe beast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the late spring a great trouble came to White Fang. Without warning,\r\nthe love-master disappeared. There had been warning, but White Fang was\r\nunversed in such things and did not understand the packing of a grip.\r\nHe remembered afterwards that his packing had preceded the master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisappearance; but at the time he suspected nothing. That night he\r\nwaited for the master to return. At midnight the chill wind that blew\r\ndrove him to shelter at the rear of the cabin. There he drowsed, only\r\nhalf asleep, his ears keyed for the first sound of the familiar step.\r\nBut, at two in the morning, his anxiety drove him out to the cold front\r\nstoop, where he crouched, and waited.\r\n\r\nBut no master came. In the morning the door opened and Matt stepped\r\noutside. White Fang gazed at him wistfully. There was no common speech\r\nby which he might learn what he wanted to know. The days came and went,\r\nbut never the master. White Fang, who had never known sickness in his\r\nlife, became sick. He became very sick, so sick that Matt was finally\r\ncompelled to bring him inside the cabin. Also, in writing to his\r\nemployer, Matt devoted a postscript to White Fang.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott reading the letter down in Circle City, came upon the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat dam wolf won\xe2\x80\x99t work. Won\xe2\x80\x99t eat. Aint got no spunk left. All the\r\ndogs is licking him. Wants to know what has become of you, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to tell him. Mebbe he is going to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as Matt had said. White Fang had ceased eating, lost heart, and\r\nallowed every dog of the team to thrash him. In the cabin he lay on the\r\nfloor near the stove, without interest in food, in Matt, nor in life.\r\nMatt might talk gently to him or swear at him, it was all the same; he\r\nnever did more than turn his dull eyes upon the man, then drop his head\r\nback to its customary position on his fore-paws.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one night, Matt, reading to himself with moving lips and\r\nmumbled sounds, was startled by a low whine from White Fang. He had got\r\nupon his feet, his ears cocked towards the door, and he was listening\r\nintently. A moment later, Matt heard a footstep. The door opened, and\r\nWeedon Scott stepped in. The two men shook hands. Then Scott looked\r\naround the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the wolf?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThen he discovered him, standing where he had been lying, near to the\r\nstove. He had not rushed forward after the manner of other dogs. He\r\nstood, watching and waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d Matt exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at \xe2\x80\x99m wag his tail!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott strode half across the room toward him, at the same time\r\ncalling him. White Fang came to him, not with a great bound, yet\r\nquickly. He was awakened from self-consciousness, but as he drew near,\r\nhis eyes took on a strange expression. Something, an incommunicable\r\nvastness of feeling, rose up into his eyes as a light and shone forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never looked at me that way all the time you was gone!\xe2\x80\x9d Matt\r\ncommented.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott did not hear. He was squatting down on his heels, face to\r\nface with White Fang and petting him\xe2\x80\x94rubbing at the roots of the ears,\r\nmaking long caressing strokes down the neck to the shoulders, tapping\r\nthe spine gently with the balls of his fingers. And White Fang was\r\ngrowling responsively, the crooning note of the growl more pronounced\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nBut that was not all. What of his joy, the great love in him, ever\r\nsurging and struggling to express itself, succeeded in finding a new\r\nmode of expression. He suddenly thrust his head forward and nudged his\r\nway in between the master\xe2\x80\x99s arm and body. And here, confined, hidden\r\nfrom view all except his ears, no longer growling, he continued to\r\nnudge and snuggle.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other. Scott\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were shining.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Matt in an awe-stricken voice.\r\n\r\nA moment later, when he had recovered himself, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI always\r\ninsisted that wolf was a dog. Look at \xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the return of the love-master, White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s recovery was rapid.\r\nTwo nights and a day he spent in the cabin. Then he sallied forth. The\r\nsled-dogs had forgotten his prowess. They remembered only the latest,\r\nwhich was his weakness and sickness. At the sight of him as he came out\r\nof the cabin, they sprang upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk about your rough-houses,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt murmured gleefully, standing in\r\nthe doorway and looking on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive \xe2\x80\x99m hell, you wolf! Give \xe2\x80\x99m hell!\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 then some!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang did not need the encouragement. The return of the\r\nlove-master was enough. Life was flowing through him again, splendid\r\nand indomitable. He fought from sheer joy, finding in it an expression\r\nof much that he felt and that otherwise was without speech. There could\r\nbe but one ending. The team dispersed in ignominious defeat, and it was\r\nnot until after dark that the dogs came sneaking back, one by one, by\r\nmeekness and humility signifying their fealty to White Fang.\r\n\r\nHaving learned to snuggle, White Fang was guilty of it often. It was\r\nthe final word. He could not go beyond it. The one thing of which he\r\nhad always been particularly jealous was his head. He had always\r\ndisliked to have it touched. It was the Wild in him, the fear of hurt\r\nand of the trap, that had given rise to the panicky impulses to avoid\r\ncontacts. It was the mandate of his instinct that that head must be\r\nfree. And now, with the love-master, his snuggling was the deliberate\r\nact of putting himself into a position of hopeless helplessness. It was\r\nan expression of perfect confidence, of absolute self-surrender, as\r\nthough he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI put myself into thy hands. Work thou thy will with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne night, not long after the return, Scott and Matt sat at a game of\r\ncribbage preliminary to going to bed. \xe2\x80\x9cFifteen-two, fifteen-four an\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\npair makes six,\xe2\x80\x9d Mat was pegging up, when there was an outcry and sound\r\nof snarling without. They looked at each other as they started to rise\r\nto their feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wolf\xe2\x80\x99s nailed somebody,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt said.\r\n\r\nA wild scream of fear and anguish hastened them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring a light!\xe2\x80\x9d Scott shouted, as he sprang outside.\r\n\r\nMatt followed with the lamp, and by its light they saw a man lying on\r\nhis back in the snow. His arms were folded, one above the other, across\r\nhis face and throat. Thus he was trying to shield himself from White\r\nFang\xe2\x80\x99s teeth. And there was need for it. White Fang was in a rage,\r\nwickedly making his attack on the most vulnerable spot. From shoulder\r\nto wrist of the crossed arms, the coat-sleeve, blue flannel shirt and\r\nundershirt were ripped in rags, while the arms themselves were terribly\r\nslashed and streaming blood.\r\n\r\nAll this the two men saw in the first instant. The next instant Weedon\r\nScott had White Fang by the throat and was dragging him clear. White\r\nFang struggled and snarled, but made no attempt to bite, while he\r\nquickly quieted down at a sharp word from the master.\r\n\r\nMatt helped the man to his feet. As he arose he lowered his crossed\r\narms, exposing the bestial face of Beauty Smith. The dog-musher let go\r\nof him precipitately, with action similar to that of a man who has\r\npicked up live fire. Beauty Smith blinked in the lamplight and looked\r\nabout him. He caught sight of White Fang and terror rushed into his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Matt noticed two objects lying in the snow. He held\r\nthe lamp close to them, indicating them with his toe for his employer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbenefit\xe2\x80\x94a steel dog-chain and a stout club.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott saw and nodded. Not a word was spoken. The dog-musher laid\r\nhis hand on Beauty Smith\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and faced him to the right about.\r\nNo word needed to be spoken. Beauty Smith started.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the love-master was patting White Fang and talking to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTried to steal you, eh? And you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it! Well, well, he made\r\na mistake, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99 thought he had hold of seventeen devils,\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher\r\nsniggered.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang, still wrought up and bristling, growled and growled, the\r\nhair slowly lying down, the crooning note remote and dim, but growing\r\nin his throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE LONG TRAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the air. White Fang sensed the coming calamity, even before\r\nthere was tangible evidence of it. In vague ways it was borne in upon\r\nhim that a change was impending. He knew not how nor why, yet he got\r\nhis feel of the oncoming event from the gods themselves. In ways\r\nsubtler than they knew, they betrayed their intentions to the wolf-dog\r\nthat haunted the cabin-stoop, and that, though he never came inside the\r\ncabin, knew what went on inside their brains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to that, will you!\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher exclaimed at supper one\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott listened. Through the door came a low, anxious whine, like\r\na sobbing under the breath that had just grown audible. Then came the\r\nlong sniff, as White Fang reassured himself that his god was still\r\ninside and had not yet taken himself off in mysterious and solitary\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe that wolf\xe2\x80\x99s on to you,\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher said.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott looked across at his companion with eyes that almost\r\npleaded, though this was given the lie by his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil can I do with a wolf in California?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil can you do with a\r\nwolf in California?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this did not satisfy Weedon Scott. The other seemed to be judging\r\nhim in a non-committal sort of way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhite man\xe2\x80\x99s dogs would have no show against him,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott went on. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nkill them on sight. If he didn\xe2\x80\x99t bankrupt me with damaged suits, the\r\nauthorities would take him away from me and electrocute him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a downright murderer, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d was the dog-musher\xe2\x80\x99s comment.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott looked at him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would never do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said decisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would never do!\xe2\x80\x9d Matt concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy you\xe2\x80\x99d have to hire a man\r\n\xe2\x80\x99specially to take care of \xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other suspicion was allayed. He nodded cheerfully. In the silence\r\nthat followed, the low, half-sobbing whine was heard at the door and\r\nthen the long, questing sniff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no denyin\xe2\x80\x99 he thinks a hell of a lot of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt said.\r\n\r\nThe other glared at him in sudden wrath. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all, man! I know my\r\nown mind and what\xe2\x80\x99s best!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m agreein\xe2\x80\x99 with you, only . . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly what?\xe2\x80\x9d Scott snapped out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly . . . \xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher began softly, then changed his mind and\r\nbetrayed a rising anger of his own. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t get so all-fired\r\nhet up about it. Judgin\xe2\x80\x99 by your actions one\xe2\x80\x99d think you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nyour own mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott debated with himself for a while, and then said more\r\ngently: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Matt. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know my own mind, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it would be rank ridiculousness for me to take that dog along,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe broke out after another pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m agreein\xe2\x80\x99 with you,\xe2\x80\x9d was Matt\xe2\x80\x99s answer, and again his employer was\r\nnot quite satisfied with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how in the name of the great Sardanapolis he knows you\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 is\r\nwhat gets me,\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher continued innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s beyond me, Matt,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott answered, with a mournful shake of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThen came the day when, through the open cabin door, White Fang saw the\r\nfatal grip on the floor and the love-master packing things into it.\r\nAlso, there were comings and goings, and the erstwhile placid\r\natmosphere of the cabin was vexed with strange perturbations and\r\nunrest. Here was indubitable evidence. White Fang had already scented\r\nit. He now reasoned it. His god was preparing for another flight. And\r\nsince he had not taken him with him before, so, now, he could look to\r\nbe left behind.\r\n\r\nThat night he lifted the long wolf-howl. As he had howled, in his puppy\r\ndays, when he fled back from the Wild to the village to find it\r\nvanished and naught but a rubbish-heap to mark the site of Grey\r\nBeaver\xe2\x80\x99s tepee, so now he pointed his muzzle to the cold stars and told\r\nto them his woe.\r\n\r\nInside the cabin the two men had just gone to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone off his food again,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt remarked from his bunk.\r\n\r\nThere was a grunt from Weedon Scott\xe2\x80\x99s bunk, and a stir of blankets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the way he cut up the other time you went away, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder\r\nthis time but what he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blankets in the other bunk stirred irritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shut up!\xe2\x80\x9d Scott cried out through the darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou nag worse\r\nthan a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m agreein\xe2\x80\x99 with you,\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher answered, and Weedon Scott was\r\nnot quite sure whether or not the other had snickered.\r\n\r\nThe next day White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety and restlessness were even more\r\npronounced. He dogged his master\xe2\x80\x99s heels whenever he left the cabin,\r\nand haunted the front stoop when he remained inside. Through the open\r\ndoor he could catch glimpses of the luggage on the floor. The grip had\r\nbeen joined by two large canvas bags and a box. Matt was rolling the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s blankets and fur robe inside a small tarpaulin. White Fang\r\nwhined as he watched the operation.\r\n\r\nLater on two Indians arrived. He watched them closely as they\r\nshouldered the luggage and were led off down the hill by Matt, who\r\ncarried the bedding and the grip. But White Fang did not follow them.\r\nThe master was still in the cabin. After a time, Matt returned. The\r\nmaster came to the door and called White Fang inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou poor devil,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently, rubbing White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s ears and tapping\r\nhis spine. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hitting the long trail, old man, where you cannot\r\nfollow. Now give me a growl\xe2\x80\x94the last, good, good-bye growl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut White Fang refused to growl. Instead, and after a wistful,\r\nsearching look, he snuggled in, burrowing his head out of sight between\r\nthe master\xe2\x80\x99s arm and body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she blows!\xe2\x80\x9d Matt cried. From the Yukon arose the hoarse\r\nbellowing of a river steamboat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to cut it short. Be sure\r\nand lock the front door. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out the back. Get a move on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two doors slammed at the same moment, and Weedon Scott waited for\r\nMatt to come around to the front. From inside the door came a low\r\nwhining and sobbing. Then there were long, deep-drawn sniffs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must take good care of him, Matt,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott said, as they started\r\ndown the hill. \xe2\x80\x9cWrite and let me know how he gets along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut listen to that, will you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth men stopped. White Fang was howling as dogs howl when their\r\nmasters lie dead. He was voicing an utter woe, his cry bursting upward\r\nin great heart-breaking rushes, dying down into quavering misery, and\r\nbursting upward again with a rush upon rush of grief.\r\n\r\nThe _Aurora_ was the first steamboat of the year for the Outside, and\r\nher decks were jammed with prosperous adventurers and broken gold\r\nseekers, all equally as mad to get to the Outside as they had been\r\noriginally to get to the Inside. Near the gang-plank, Scott was shaking\r\nhands with Matt, who was preparing to go ashore. But Matt\xe2\x80\x99s hand went\r\nlimp in the other\xe2\x80\x99s grasp as his gaze shot past and remained fixed on\r\nsomething behind him. Scott turned to see. Sitting on the deck several\r\nfeet away and watching wistfully was White Fang.\r\n\r\nThe dog-musher swore softly, in awe-stricken accents. Scott could only\r\nlook in wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you lock the front door?\xe2\x80\x9d Matt demanded. The other nodded, and\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow about the back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just bet I did,\xe2\x80\x9d was the fervent reply.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang flattened his ears ingratiatingly, but remained where he\r\nwas, making no attempt to approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take \xe2\x80\x99m ashore with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatt made a couple of steps toward White Fang, but the latter slid away\r\nfrom him. The dog-musher made a rush of it, and White Fang dodged\r\nbetween the legs of a group of men. Ducking, turning, doubling, he slid\r\nabout the deck, eluding the other\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to capture him.\r\n\r\nBut when the love-master spoke, White Fang came to him with prompt\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t come to the hand that\xe2\x80\x99s fed \xe2\x80\x99m all these months,\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher\r\nmuttered resentfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x94you ain\xe2\x80\x99t never fed \xe2\x80\x99m after them first\r\ndays of gettin\xe2\x80\x99 acquainted. I\xe2\x80\x99m blamed if I can see how he works it out\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99re the boss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScott, who had been patting White Fang, suddenly bent closer and\r\npointed out fresh-made cuts on his muzzle, and a gash between the eyes.\r\n\r\nMatt bent over and passed his hand along White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s belly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe plump forgot the window. He\xe2\x80\x99s all cut an\xe2\x80\x99 gouged underneath. Must\r\n\xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99 butted clean through it, b\xe2\x80\x99gosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Weedon Scott was not listening. He was thinking rapidly. The\r\n_Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s_ whistle hooted a final announcement of departure. Men were\r\nscurrying down the gang-plank to the shore. Matt loosened the bandana\r\nfrom his own neck and started to put it around White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s. Scott\r\ngrasped the dog-musher\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Matt, old man. About the wolf\xe2\x80\x94you needn\xe2\x80\x99t write. You see,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve . . . !\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-musher exploded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say . . .?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing I mean. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your bandana. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to you about\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatt paused halfway down the gang-plank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never stand the climate!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted back. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you clip \xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin warm weather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gang-plank was hauled in, and the _Aurora_ swung out from the bank.\r\nWeedon Scott waved a last good-bye. Then he turned and bent over White\r\nFang, standing by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow growl, damn you, growl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he patted the responsive head\r\nand rubbed the flattening ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE SOUTHLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Fang landed from the steamer in San Francisco. He was appalled.\r\nDeep in him, below any reasoning process or act of consciousness, he\r\nhad associated power with godhead. And never had the white men seemed\r\nsuch marvellous gods as now, when he trod the slimy pavement of San\r\nFrancisco. The log cabins he had known were replaced by towering\r\nbuildings. The streets were crowded with perils\xe2\x80\x94waggons, carts,\r\nautomobiles; great, straining horses pulling huge trucks; and monstrous\r\ncable and electric cars hooting and clanging through the midst,\r\nscreeching their insistent menace after the manner of the lynxes he had\r\nknown in the northern woods.\r\n\r\nAll this was the manifestation of power. Through it all, behind it all,\r\nwas man, governing and controlling, expressing himself, as of old, by\r\nhis mastery over matter. It was colossal, stunning. White Fang was\r\nawed. Fear sat upon him. As in his cubhood he had been made to feel his\r\nsmallness and puniness on the day he first came in from the Wild to the\r\nvillage of Grey Beaver, so now, in his full-grown stature and pride of\r\nstrength, he was made to feel small and puny. And there were so many\r\ngods! He was made dizzy by the swarming of them. The thunder of the\r\nstreets smote upon his ears. He was bewildered by the tremendous and\r\nendless rush and movement of things. As never before, he felt his\r\ndependence on the love-master, close at whose heels he followed, no\r\nmatter what happened never losing sight of him.\r\n\r\nBut White Fang was to have no more than a nightmare vision of the\r\ncity\xe2\x80\x94an experience that was like a bad dream, unreal and terrible, that\r\nhaunted him for long after in his dreams. He was put into a baggage-car\r\nby the master, chained in a corner in the midst of heaped trunks and\r\nvalises. Here a squat and brawny god held sway, with much noise,\r\nhurling trunks and boxes about, dragging them in through the door and\r\ntossing them into the piles, or flinging them out of the door, smashing\r\nand crashing, to other gods who awaited them.\r\n\r\nAnd here, in this inferno of luggage, was White Fang deserted by the\r\nmaster. Or at least White Fang thought he was deserted, until he\r\nsmelled out the master\xe2\x80\x99s canvas clothes-bags alongside of him, and\r\nproceeded to mount guard over them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Bout time you come,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the god of the car, an hour later, when\r\nWeedon Scott appeared at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cThat dog of yourn won\xe2\x80\x99t let me lay\r\na finger on your stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang emerged from the car. He was astonished. The nightmare city\r\nwas gone. The car had been to him no more than a room in a house, and\r\nwhen he had entered it the city had been all around him. In the\r\ninterval the city had disappeared. The roar of it no longer dinned upon\r\nhis ears. Before him was smiling country, streaming with sunshine, lazy\r\nwith quietude. But he had little time to marvel at the transformation.\r\nHe accepted it as he accepted all the unaccountable doings and\r\nmanifestations of the gods. It was their way.\r\n\r\nThere was a carriage waiting. A man and a woman approached the master.\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s arms went out and clutched the master around the neck\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhostile act! The next moment Weedon Scott had torn loose from the\r\nembrace and closed with White Fang, who had become a snarling, raging\r\ndemon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott was saying as he kept tight hold of\r\nWhite Fang and placated him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thought you were going to injure me,\r\nand he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand for it. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlearn soon enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in the meantime I may be permitted to love my son when his dog is\r\nnot around,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, though she was pale and weak from the fright.\r\n\r\nShe looked at White Fang, who snarled and bristled and glared\r\nmalevolently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to learn, and he shall, without postponement,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott said.\r\n\r\nHe spoke softly to White Fang until he had quieted him, then his voice\r\nbecame firm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown, sir! Down with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis had been one of the things taught him by the master, and White\r\nFang obeyed, though he lay down reluctantly and sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScott opened his arms to her, but kept his eyes on White Fang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown!\xe2\x80\x9d he warned. \xe2\x80\x9cDown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang, bristling silently, half-crouching as he rose, sank back\r\nand watched the hostile act repeated. But no harm came of it, nor of\r\nthe embrace from the strange man-god that followed. Then the\r\nclothes-bags were taken into the carriage, the strange gods and the\r\nlove-master followed, and White Fang pursued, now running vigilantly\r\nbehind, now bristling up to the running horses and warning them that he\r\nwas there to see that no harm befell the god they dragged so swiftly\r\nacross the earth.\r\n\r\nAt the end of fifteen minutes, the carriage swung in through a stone\r\ngateway and on between a double row of arched and interlacing walnut\r\ntrees. On either side stretched lawns, their broad sweep broken here\r\nand there by great sturdy-limbed oaks. In the near distance, in\r\ncontrast with the young-green of the tended grass, sunburnt hay-fields\r\nshowed tan and gold; while beyond were the tawny hills and upland\r\npastures. From the head of the lawn, on the first soft swell from the\r\nvalley-level, looked down the deep-porched, many-windowed house.\r\n\r\nLittle opportunity was given White Fang to see all this. Hardly had the\r\ncarriage entered the grounds, when he was set upon by a sheep-dog,\r\nbright-eyed, sharp-muzzled, righteously indignant and angry. It was\r\nbetween him and the master, cutting him off. White Fang snarled no\r\nwarning, but his hair bristled as he made his silent and deadly rush.\r\nThis rush was never completed. He halted with awkward abruptness, with\r\nstiff fore-legs bracing himself against his momentum, almost sitting\r\ndown on his haunches, so desirous was he of avoiding contact with the\r\ndog he was in the act of attacking. It was a female, and the law of his\r\nkind thrust a barrier between. For him to attack her would require\r\nnothing less than a violation of his instinct.\r\n\r\nBut with the sheep-dog it was otherwise. Being a female, she possessed\r\nno such instinct. On the other hand, being a sheep-dog, her instinctive\r\nfear of the Wild, and especially of the wolf, was unusually keen. White\r\nFang was to her a wolf, the hereditary marauder who had preyed upon her\r\nflocks from the time sheep were first herded and guarded by some dim\r\nancestor of hers. And so, as he abandoned his rush at her and braced\r\nhimself to avoid the contact, she sprang upon him. He snarled\r\ninvoluntarily as he felt her teeth in his shoulder, but beyond this\r\nmade no offer to hurt her. He backed away, stiff-legged with\r\nself-consciousness, and tried to go around her. He dodged this way and\r\nthat, and curved and turned, but to no purpose. She remained always\r\nbetween him and the way he wanted to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Collie!\xe2\x80\x9d called the strange man in the carriage.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, father. It is good discipline. White Fang will have to\r\nlearn many things, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just as well that he begins now. He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nadjust himself all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carriage drove on, and still Collie blocked White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s way. He\r\ntried to outrun her by leaving the drive and circling across the lawn\r\nbut she ran on the inner and smaller circle, and was always there,\r\nfacing him with her two rows of gleaming teeth. Back he circled, across\r\nthe drive to the other lawn, and again she headed him off.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was bearing the master away. White Fang caught glimpses of\r\nit disappearing amongst the trees. The situation was desperate. He\r\nessayed another circle. She followed, running swiftly. And then,\r\nsuddenly, he turned upon her. It was his old fighting trick. Shoulder\r\nto shoulder, he struck her squarely. Not only was she overthrown. So\r\nfast had she been running that she rolled along, now on her back, now\r\non her side, as she struggled to stop, clawing gravel with her feet and\r\ncrying shrilly her hurt pride and indignation.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang did not wait. The way was clear, and that was all he had\r\nwanted. She took after him, never ceasing her outcry. It was the\r\nstraightaway now, and when it came to real running, White Fang could\r\nteach her things. She ran frantically, hysterically, straining to the\r\nutmost, advertising the effort she was making with every leap: and all\r\nthe time White Fang slid smoothly away from her silently, without\r\neffort, gliding like a ghost over the ground.\r\n\r\nAs he rounded the house to the _porte-coch\xc3\xa8re_, he came upon the\r\ncarriage. It had stopped, and the master was alighting. At this moment,\r\nstill running at top speed, White Fang became suddenly aware of an\r\nattack from the side. It was a deer-hound rushing upon him. White Fang\r\ntried to face it. But he was going too fast, and the hound was too\r\nclose. It struck him on the side; and such was his forward momentum and\r\nthe unexpectedness of it, White Fang was hurled to the ground and\r\nrolled clear over. He came out of the tangle a spectacle of malignancy,\r\nears flattened back, lips writhing, nose wrinkling, his teeth clipping\r\ntogether as the fangs barely missed the hound\xe2\x80\x99s soft throat.\r\n\r\nThe master was running up, but was too far away; and it was Collie that\r\nsaved the hound\xe2\x80\x99s life. Before White Fang could spring in and deliver\r\nthe fatal stroke, and just as he was in the act of springing in, Collie\r\narrived. She had been out-manoeuvred and out-run, to say nothing of her\r\nhaving been unceremoniously tumbled in the gravel, and her arrival was\r\nlike that of a tornado\xe2\x80\x94made up of offended dignity, justifiable wrath,\r\nand instinctive hatred for this marauder from the Wild. She struck\r\nWhite Fang at right angles in the midst of his spring, and again he was\r\nknocked off his feet and rolled over.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the master arrived, and with one hand held White Fang,\r\nwhile the father called off the dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, this is a pretty warm reception for a poor lone wolf from the\r\nArctic,\xe2\x80\x9d the master said, while White Fang calmed down under his\r\ncaressing hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all his life he\xe2\x80\x99s only been known once to go off\r\nhis feet, and here he\xe2\x80\x99s been rolled twice in thirty seconds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carriage had driven away, and other strange gods had appeared from\r\nout the house. Some of these stood respectfully at a distance; but two\r\nof them, women, perpetrated the hostile act of clutching the master\r\naround the neck. White Fang, however, was beginning to tolerate this\r\nact. No harm seemed to come of it, while the noises the gods made were\r\ncertainly not threatening. These gods also made overtures to White\r\nFang, but he warned them off with a snarl, and the master did likewise\r\nwith word of mouth. At such times White Fang leaned in close against\r\nthe master\xe2\x80\x99s legs and received reassuring pats on the head.\r\n\r\nThe hound, under the command, \xe2\x80\x9cDick! Lie down, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d had gone up the\r\nsteps and lain down to one side of the porch, still growling and\r\nkeeping a sullen watch on the intruder. Collie had been taken in charge\r\nby one of the woman-gods, who held arms around her neck and petted and\r\ncaressed her; but Collie was very much perplexed and worried, whining\r\nand restless, outraged by the permitted presence of this wolf and\r\nconfident that the gods were making a mistake.\r\n\r\nAll the gods started up the steps to enter the house. White Fang\r\nfollowed closely at the master\xe2\x80\x99s heels. Dick, on the porch, growled,\r\nand White Fang, on the steps, bristled and growled back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake Collie inside and leave the two of them to fight it out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsuggested Scott\xe2\x80\x99s father. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen White Fang, to show his friendship, will have to be chief mourner\r\nat the funeral,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the master.\r\n\r\nThe elder Scott looked incredulously, first at White Fang, then at\r\nDick, and finally at his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean . . .?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeedon nodded his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean just that. You\xe2\x80\x99d have a dead Dick\r\ninside one minute\xe2\x80\x94two minutes at the farthest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to White Fang. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, you wolf. It\xe2\x80\x99s you that\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\r\ncome inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang walked stiff-legged up the steps and across the porch, with\r\ntail rigidly erect, keeping his eyes on Dick to guard against a flank\r\nattack, and at the same time prepared for whatever fierce manifestation\r\nof the unknown that might pounce out upon him from the interior of the\r\nhouse. But no thing of fear pounced out, and when he had gained the\r\ninside he scouted carefully around, looking at it and finding it not.\r\nThen he lay down with a contented grunt at the master\xe2\x80\x99s feet, observing\r\nall that went on, ever ready to spring to his feet and fight for life\r\nwith the terrors he felt must lurk under the trap-roof of the dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE GOD\xe2\x80\x99S DOMAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only was White Fang adaptable by nature, but he had travelled much,\r\nand knew the meaning and necessity of adjustment. Here, in Sierra\r\nVista, which was the name of Judge Scott\xe2\x80\x99s place, White Fang quickly\r\nbegan to make himself at home. He had no further serious trouble with\r\nthe dogs. They knew more about the ways of the Southland gods than did\r\nhe, and in their eyes he had qualified when he accompanied the gods\r\ninside the house. Wolf that he was, and unprecedented as it was, the\r\ngods had sanctioned his presence, and they, the dogs of the gods, could\r\nonly recognise this sanction.\r\n\r\nDick, perforce, had to go through a few stiff formalities at first,\r\nafter which he calmly accepted White Fang as an addition to the\r\npremises. Had Dick had his way, they would have been good friends. All\r\nbut White Fang was averse to friendship. All he asked of other dogs was\r\nto be let alone. His whole life he had kept aloof from his kind, and he\r\nstill desired to keep aloof. Dick\xe2\x80\x99s overtures bothered him, so he\r\nsnarled Dick away. In the north he had learned the lesson that he must\r\nlet the master\xe2\x80\x99s dogs alone, and he did not forget that lesson now. But\r\nhe insisted on his own privacy and self-seclusion, and so thoroughly\r\nignored Dick that that good-natured creature finally gave him up and\r\nscarcely took as much interest in him as in the hitching-post near the\r\nstable.\r\n\r\nNot so with Collie. While she accepted him because it was the mandate\r\nof the gods, that was no reason that she should leave him in peace.\r\nWoven into her being was the memory of countless crimes he and his had\r\nperpetrated against her ancestry. Not in a day nor a generation were\r\nthe ravaged sheepfolds to be forgotten. All this was a spur to her,\r\npricking her to retaliation. She could not fly in the face of the gods\r\nwho permitted him, but that did not prevent her from making life\r\nmiserable for him in petty ways. A feud, ages old, was between them,\r\nand she, for one, would see to it that he was reminded.\r\n\r\nSo Collie took advantage of her sex to pick upon White Fang and\r\nmaltreat him. His instinct would not permit him to attack her, while\r\nher persistence would not permit him to ignore her. When she rushed at\r\nhim he turned his fur-protected shoulder to her sharp teeth and walked\r\naway stiff-legged and stately. When she forced him too hard, he was\r\ncompelled to go about in a circle, his shoulder presented to her, his\r\nhead turned from her, and on his face and in his eyes a patient and\r\nbored expression. Sometimes, however, a nip on his hind-quarters\r\nhastened his retreat and made it anything but stately. But as a rule he\r\nmanaged to maintain a dignity that was almost solemnity. He ignored her\r\nexistence whenever it was possible, and made it a point to keep out of\r\nher way. When he saw or heard her coming, he got up and walked off.\r\n\r\nThere was much in other matters for White Fang to learn. Life in the\r\nNorthland was simplicity itself when compared with the complicated\r\naffairs of Sierra Vista. First of all, he had to learn the family of\r\nthe master. In a way he was prepared to do this. As Mit-sah and\r\nKloo-kooch had belonged to Grey Beaver, sharing his food, his fire, and\r\nhis blankets, so now, at Sierra Vista, belonged to the love-master all\r\nthe denizens of the house.\r\n\r\nBut in this matter there was a difference, and many differences. Sierra\r\nVista was a far vaster affair than the tepee of Grey Beaver. There were\r\nmany persons to be considered. There was Judge Scott, and there was his\r\nwife. There were the master\xe2\x80\x99s two sisters, Beth and Mary. There was his\r\nwife, Alice, and then there were his children, Weedon and Maud,\r\ntoddlers of four and six. There was no way for anybody to tell him\r\nabout all these people, and of blood-ties and relationship he knew\r\nnothing whatever and never would be capable of knowing. Yet he quickly\r\nworked it out that all of them belonged to the master. Then, by\r\nobservation, whenever opportunity offered, by study of action, speech,\r\nand the very intonations of the voice, he slowly learned the intimacy\r\nand the degree of favour they enjoyed with the master. And by this\r\nascertained standard, White Fang treated them accordingly. What was of\r\nvalue to the master he valued; what was dear to the master was to be\r\ncherished by White Fang and guarded carefully.\r\n\r\nThus it was with the two children. All his life he had disliked\r\nchildren. He hated and feared their hands. The lessons were not tender\r\nthat he had learned of their tyranny and cruelty in the days of the\r\nIndian villages. When Weedon and Maud had first approached him, he\r\ngrowled warningly and looked malignant. A cuff from the master and a\r\nsharp word had then compelled him to permit their caresses, though he\r\ngrowled and growled under their tiny hands, and in the growl there was\r\nno crooning note. Later, he observed that the boy and girl were of\r\ngreat value in the master\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Then it was that no cuff nor sharp\r\nword was necessary before they could pat him.\r\n\r\nYet White Fang was never effusively affectionate. He yielded to the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s children with an ill but honest grace, and endured their\r\nfooling as one would endure a painful operation. When he could no\r\nlonger endure, he would get up and stalk determinedly away from them.\r\nBut after a time, he grew even to like the children. Still he was not\r\ndemonstrative. He would not go up to them. On the other hand, instead\r\nof walking away at sight of them, he waited for them to come to him.\r\nAnd still later, it was noticed that a pleased light came into his eyes\r\nwhen he saw them approaching, and that he looked after them with an\r\nappearance of curious regret when they left him for other amusements.\r\n\r\nAll this was a matter of development, and took time. Next in his\r\nregard, after the children, was Judge Scott. There were two reasons,\r\npossibly, for this. First, he was evidently a valuable possession of\r\nthe master\xe2\x80\x99s, and next, he was undemonstrative. White Fang liked to lie\r\nat his feet on the wide porch when he read the newspaper, from time to\r\ntime favouring White Fang with a look or a word\xe2\x80\x94untroublesome tokens\r\nthat he recognised White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s presence and existence. But this was\r\nonly when the master was not around. When the master appeared, all\r\nother beings ceased to exist so far as White Fang was concerned.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang allowed all the members of the family to pet him and make\r\nmuch of him; but he never gave to them what he gave to the master. No\r\ncaress of theirs could put the love-croon into his throat, and, try as\r\nthey would, they could never persuade him into snuggling against them.\r\nThis expression of abandon and surrender, of absolute trust, he\r\nreserved for the master alone. In fact, he never regarded the members\r\nof the family in any other light than possessions of the love-master.\r\n\r\nAlso White Fang had early come to differentiate between the family and\r\nthe servants of the household. The latter were afraid of him, while he\r\nmerely refrained from attacking them. This because he considered that\r\nthey were likewise possessions of the master. Between White Fang and\r\nthem existed a neutrality and no more. They cooked for the master and\r\nwashed the dishes and did other things just as Matt had done up in the\r\nKlondike. They were, in short, appurtenances of the household.\r\n\r\nOutside the household there was even more for White Fang to learn. The\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s domain was wide and complex, yet it had its metes and bounds.\r\nThe land itself ceased at the county road. Outside was the common\r\ndomain of all gods\xe2\x80\x94the roads and streets. Then inside other fences were\r\nthe particular domains of other gods. A myriad laws governed all these\r\nthings and determined conduct; yet he did not know the speech of the\r\ngods, nor was there any way for him to learn save by experience. He\r\nobeyed his natural impulses until they ran him counter to some law.\r\nWhen this had been done a few times, he learned the law and after that\r\nobserved it.\r\n\r\nBut most potent in his education was the cuff of the master\xe2\x80\x99s hand, the\r\ncensure of the master\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Because of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s very great love,\r\na cuff from the master hurt him far more than any beating Grey Beaver\r\nor Beauty Smith had ever given him. They had hurt only the flesh of\r\nhim; beneath the flesh the spirit had still raged, splendid and\r\ninvincible. But with the master the cuff was always too light to hurt\r\nthe flesh. Yet it went deeper. It was an expression of the master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisapproval, and White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s spirit wilted under it.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the cuff was rarely administered. The master\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nwas sufficient. By it White Fang knew whether he did right or not. By\r\nit he trimmed his conduct and adjusted his actions. It was the compass\r\nby which he steered and learned to chart the manners of a new land and\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn the Northland, the only domesticated animal was the dog. All other\r\nanimals lived in the Wild, and were, when not too formidable, lawful\r\nspoil for any dog. All his days White Fang had foraged among the live\r\nthings for food. It did not enter his head that in the Southland it was\r\notherwise. But this he was to learn early in his residence in Santa\r\nClara Valley. Sauntering around the corner of the house in the early\r\nmorning, he came upon a chicken that had escaped from the chicken-yard.\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s natural impulse was to eat it. A couple of bounds, a flash\r\nof teeth and a frightened squawk, and he had scooped in the adventurous\r\nfowl. It was farm-bred and fat and tender; and White Fang licked his\r\nchops and decided that such fare was good.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, he chanced upon another stray chicken near the\r\nstables. One of the grooms ran to the rescue. He did not know White\r\nFang\xe2\x80\x99s breed, so for weapon he took a light buggy-whip. At the first\r\ncut of the whip, White Fang left the chicken for the man. A club might\r\nhave stopped White Fang, but not a whip. Silently, without flinching,\r\nhe took a second cut in his forward rush, and as he leaped for the\r\nthroat the groom cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d and staggered backward. He\r\ndropped the whip and shielded his throat with his arms. In consequence,\r\nhis forearm was ripped open to the bone.\r\n\r\nThe man was badly frightened. It was not so much White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s ferocity\r\nas it was his silence that unnerved the groom. Still protecting his\r\nthroat and face with his torn and bleeding arm, he tried to retreat to\r\nthe barn. And it would have gone hard with him had not Collie appeared\r\non the scene. As she had saved Dick\xe2\x80\x99s life, she now saved the groom\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nShe rushed upon White Fang in frenzied wrath. She had been right. She\r\nhad known better than the blundering gods. All her suspicions were\r\njustified. Here was the ancient marauder up to his old tricks again.\r\n\r\nThe groom escaped into the stables, and White Fang backed away before\r\nCollie\xe2\x80\x99s wicked teeth, or presented his shoulder to them and circled\r\nround and round. But Collie did not give over, as was her wont, after a\r\ndecent interval of chastisement. On the contrary, she grew more excited\r\nand angry every moment, until, in the end, White Fang flung dignity to\r\nthe winds and frankly fled away from her across the fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll learn to leave chickens alone,\xe2\x80\x9d the master said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive him the lesson until I catch him in the act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo nights later came the act, but on a more generous scale than the\r\nmaster had anticipated. White Fang had observed closely the\r\nchicken-yards and the habits of the chickens. In the night-time, after\r\nthey had gone to roost, he climbed to the top of a pile of newly hauled\r\nlumber. From there he gained the roof of a chicken-house, passed over\r\nthe ridgepole and dropped to the ground inside. A moment later he was\r\ninside the house, and the slaughter began.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when the master came out on to the porch, fifty white\r\nLeghorn hens, laid out in a row by the groom, greeted his eyes. He\r\nwhistled to himself, softly, first with surprise, and then, at the end,\r\nwith admiration. His eyes were likewise greeted by White Fang, but\r\nabout the latter there were no signs of shame nor guilt. He carried\r\nhimself with pride, as though, forsooth, he had achieved a deed\r\npraiseworthy and meritorious. There was about him no consciousness of\r\nsin. The master\xe2\x80\x99s lips tightened as he faced the disagreeable task.\r\nThen he talked harshly to the unwitting culprit, and in his voice there\r\nwas nothing but godlike wrath. Also, he held White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s nose down to\r\nthe slain hens, and at the same time cuffed him soundly.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang never raided a chicken-roost again. It was against the law,\r\nand he had learned it. Then the master took him into the chicken-yards.\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s natural impulse, when he saw the live food fluttering\r\nabout him and under his very nose, was to spring upon it. He obeyed the\r\nimpulse, but was checked by the master\xe2\x80\x99s voice. They continued in the\r\nyards for half an hour. Time and again the impulse surged over White\r\nFang, and each time, as he yielded to it, he was checked by the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Thus it was he learned the law, and ere he left the\r\ndomain of the chickens, he had learned to ignore their existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can never cure a chicken-killer.\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Scott shook his head sadly\r\nat luncheon table, when his son narrated the lesson he had given White\r\nFang. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce they\xe2\x80\x99ve got the habit and the taste of blood . . .\xe2\x80\x9d Again\r\nhe shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\nBut Weedon Scott did not agree with his father. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d he challenged finally. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lock White Fang in with the\r\nchickens all afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think of the chickens,\xe2\x80\x9d objected the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd furthermore,\xe2\x80\x9d the son went on, \xe2\x80\x9cfor every chicken he kills, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npay you one dollar gold coin of the realm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you should penalise father, too,\xe2\x80\x9d interpose Beth.\r\n\r\nHer sister seconded her, and a chorus of approval arose from around the\r\ntable. Judge Scott nodded his head in agreement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d Weedon Scott pondered for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if, at the end of\r\nthe afternoon White Fang hasn\xe2\x80\x99t harmed a chicken, for every ten minutes\r\nof the time he has spent in the yard, you will have to say to him,\r\ngravely and with deliberation, just as if you were sitting on the bench\r\nand solemnly passing judgment, \xe2\x80\x98White Fang, you are smarter than I\r\nthought.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom hidden points of vantage the family watched the performance. But\r\nit was a fizzle. Locked in the yard and there deserted by the master,\r\nWhite Fang lay down and went to sleep. Once he got up and walked over\r\nto the trough for a drink of water. The chickens he calmly ignored. So\r\nfar as he was concerned they did not exist. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock he executed\r\na running jump, gained the roof of the chicken-house and leaped to the\r\nground outside, whence he sauntered gravely to the house. He had\r\nlearned the law. And on the porch, before the delighted family, Judge\r\nScott, face to face with White Fang, said slowly and solemnly, sixteen\r\ntimes, \xe2\x80\x9cWhite Fang, you are smarter than I thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was the multiplicity of laws that befuddled White Fang and often\r\nbrought him into disgrace. He had to learn that he must not touch the\r\nchickens that belonged to other gods. Then there were cats, and\r\nrabbits, and turkeys; all these he must let alone. In fact, when he had\r\nbut partly learned the law, his impression was that he must leave all\r\nlive things alone. Out in the back-pasture, a quail could flutter up\r\nunder his nose unharmed. All tense and trembling with eagerness and\r\ndesire, he mastered his instinct and stood still. He was obeying the\r\nwill of the gods.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one day, again out in the back-pasture, he saw Dick start a\r\njackrabbit and run it. The master himself was looking on and did not\r\ninterfere. Nay, he encouraged White Fang to join in the chase. And thus\r\nhe learned that there was no taboo on jackrabbits. In the end he worked\r\nout the complete law. Between him and all domestic animals there must\r\nbe no hostilities. If not amity, at least neutrality must obtain. But\r\nthe other animals\xe2\x80\x94the squirrels, and quail, and cottontails, were\r\ncreatures of the Wild who had never yielded allegiance to man. They\r\nwere the lawful prey of any dog. It was only the tame that the gods\r\nprotected, and between the tame deadly strife was not permitted. The\r\ngods held the power of life and death over their subjects, and the gods\r\nwere jealous of their power.\r\n\r\nLife was complex in the Santa Clara Valley after the simplicities of\r\nthe Northland. And the chief thing demanded by these intricacies of\r\ncivilisation was control, restraint\xe2\x80\x94a poise of self that was as\r\ndelicate as the fluttering of gossamer wings and at the same time as\r\nrigid as steel. Life had a thousand faces, and White Fang found he must\r\nmeet them all\xe2\x80\x94thus, when he went to town, in to San Jose, running\r\nbehind the carriage or loafing about the streets when the carriage\r\nstopped. Life flowed past him, deep and wide and varied, continually\r\nimpinging upon his senses, demanding of him instant and endless\r\nadjustments and correspondences, and compelling him, almost always, to\r\nsuppress his natural impulses.\r\n\r\nThere were butcher-shops where meat hung within reach. This meat he\r\nmust not touch. There were cats at the houses the master visited that\r\nmust be let alone. And there were dogs everywhere that snarled at him\r\nand that he must not attack. And then, on the crowded sidewalks there\r\nwere persons innumerable whose attention he attracted. They would stop\r\nand look at him, point him out to one another, examine him, talk of\r\nhim, and, worst of all, pat him. And these perilous contacts from all\r\nthese strange hands he must endure. Yet this endurance he achieved.\r\nFurthermore, he got over being awkward and self-conscious. In a lofty\r\nway he received the attentions of the multitudes of strange gods. With\r\ncondescension he accepted their condescension. On the other hand, there\r\nwas something about him that prevented great familiarity. They patted\r\nhim on the head and passed on, contented and pleased with their own\r\ndaring.\r\n\r\nBut it was not all easy for White Fang. Running behind the carriage in\r\nthe outskirts of San Jose, he encountered certain small boys who made a\r\npractice of flinging stones at him. Yet he knew that it was not\r\npermitted him to pursue and drag them down. Here he was compelled to\r\nviolate his instinct of self-preservation, and violate it he did, for\r\nhe was becoming tame and qualifying himself for civilisation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, White Fang was not quite satisfied with the arrangement.\r\nHe had no abstract ideas about justice and fair play. But there is a\r\ncertain sense of equity that resides in life, and it was this sense in\r\nhim that resented the unfairness of his being permitted no defence\r\nagainst the stone-throwers. He forgot that in the covenant entered into\r\nbetween him and the gods they were pledged to care for him and defend\r\nhim. But one day the master sprang from the carriage, whip in hand, and\r\ngave the stone-throwers a thrashing. After that they threw stones no\r\nmore, and White Fang understood and was satisfied.\r\n\r\nOne other experience of similar nature was his. On the way to town,\r\nhanging around the saloon at the cross-roads, were three dogs that made\r\na practice of rushing out upon him when he went by. Knowing his deadly\r\nmethod of fighting, the master had never ceased impressing upon White\r\nFang the law that he must not fight. As a result, having learned the\r\nlesson well, White Fang was hard put whenever he passed the cross-roads\r\nsaloon. After the first rush, each time, his snarl kept the three dogs\r\nat a distance but they trailed along behind, yelping and bickering and\r\ninsulting him. This endured for some time. The men at the saloon even\r\nurged the dogs on to attack White Fang. One day they openly sicked the\r\ndogs on him. The master stopped the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to White Fang.\r\n\r\nBut White Fang could not believe. He looked at the master, and he\r\nlooked at the dogs. Then he looked back eagerly and questioningly at\r\nthe master.\r\n\r\nThe master nodded his head. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to them, old fellow. Eat them up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang no longer hesitated. He turned and leaped silently among his\r\nenemies. All three faced him. There was a great snarling and growling,\r\na clashing of teeth and a flurry of bodies. The dust of the road arose\r\nin a cloud and screened the battle. But at the end of several minutes\r\ntwo dogs were struggling in the dirt and the third was in full flight.\r\nHe leaped a ditch, went through a rail fence, and fled across a field.\r\nWhite Fang followed, sliding over the ground in wolf fashion and with\r\nwolf speed, swiftly and without noise, and in the centre of the field\r\nhe dragged down and slew the dog.\r\n\r\nWith this triple killing his main troubles with dogs ceased. The word\r\nwent up and down the valley, and men saw to it that their dogs did not\r\nmolest the Fighting Wolf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE CALL OF KIND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe months came and went. There was plenty of food and no work in the\r\nSouthland, and White Fang lived fat and prosperous and happy. Not alone\r\nwas he in the geographical Southland, for he was in the Southland of\r\nlife. Human kindness was like a sun shining upon him, and he flourished\r\nlike a flower planted in good soil.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he remained somehow different from other dogs. He knew the law\r\neven better than did the dogs that had known no other life, and he\r\nobserved the law more punctiliously; but still there was about him a\r\nsuggestion of lurking ferocity, as though the Wild still lingered in\r\nhim and the wolf in him merely slept.\r\n\r\nHe never chummed with other dogs. Lonely he had lived, so far as his\r\nkind was concerned, and lonely he would continue to live. In his\r\npuppyhood, under the persecution of Lip-lip and the puppy-pack, and in\r\nhis fighting days with Beauty Smith, he had acquired a fixed aversion\r\nfor dogs. The natural course of his life had been diverted, and,\r\nrecoiling from his kind, he had clung to the human.\r\n\r\nBesides, all Southland dogs looked upon him with suspicion. He aroused\r\nin them their instinctive fear of the Wild, and they greeted him always\r\nwith snarl and growl and belligerent hatred. He, on the other hand,\r\nlearned that it was not necessary to use his teeth upon them. His naked\r\nfangs and writhing lips were uniformly efficacious, rarely failing to\r\nsend a bellowing on-rushing dog back on its haunches.\r\n\r\nBut there was one trial in White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x94Collie. She never gave him\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace. She was not so amenable to the law as he. She defied\r\nall efforts of the master to make her become friends with White Fang.\r\nEver in his ears was sounding her sharp and nervous snarl. She had\r\nnever forgiven him the chicken-killing episode, and persistently held\r\nto the belief that his intentions were bad. She found him guilty before\r\nthe act, and treated him accordingly. She became a pest to him, like a\r\npoliceman following him around the stable and the hounds, and, if he\r\neven so much as glanced curiously at a pigeon or chicken, bursting into\r\nan outcry of indignation and wrath. His favourite way of ignoring her\r\nwas to lie down, with his head on his fore-paws, and pretend sleep.\r\nThis always dumfounded and silenced her.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Collie, all things went well with White Fang. He\r\nhad learned control and poise, and he knew the law. He achieved a\r\nstaidness, and calmness, and philosophic tolerance. He no longer lived\r\nin a hostile environment. Danger and hurt and death did not lurk\r\neverywhere about him. In time, the unknown, as a thing of terror and\r\nmenace ever impending, faded away. Life was soft and easy. It flowed\r\nalong smoothly, and neither fear nor foe lurked by the way.\r\n\r\nHe missed the snow without being aware of it. \xe2\x80\x9cAn unduly long summer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwould have been his thought had he thought about it; as it was, he\r\nmerely missed the snow in a vague, subconscious way. In the same\r\nfashion, especially in the heat of summer when he suffered from the\r\nsun, he experienced faint longings for the Northland. Their only effect\r\nupon him, however, was to make him uneasy and restless without his\r\nknowing what was the matter.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang had never been very demonstrative. Beyond his snuggling and\r\nthe throwing of a crooning note into his love-growl, he had no way of\r\nexpressing his love. Yet it was given him to discover a third way. He\r\nhad always been susceptible to the laughter of the gods. Laughter had\r\naffected him with madness, made him frantic with rage. But he did not\r\nhave it in him to be angry with the love-master, and when that god\r\nelected to laugh at him in a good-natured, bantering way, he was\r\nnonplussed. He could feel the pricking and stinging of the old anger as\r\nit strove to rise up in him, but it strove against love. He could not\r\nbe angry; yet he had to do something. At first he was dignified, and\r\nthe master laughed the harder. Then he tried to be more dignified, and\r\nthe master laughed harder than before. In the end, the master laughed\r\nhim out of his dignity. His jaws slightly parted, his lips lifted a\r\nlittle, and a quizzical expression that was more love than humour came\r\ninto his eyes. He had learned to laugh.\r\n\r\nLikewise he learned to romp with the master, to be tumbled down and\r\nrolled over, and be the victim of innumerable rough tricks. In return\r\nhe feigned anger, bristling and growling ferociously, and clipping his\r\nteeth together in snaps that had all the seeming of deadly intention.\r\nBut he never forgot himself. Those snaps were always delivered on the\r\nempty air. At the end of such a romp, when blow and cuff and snap and\r\nsnarl were fast and furious, they would break off suddenly and stand\r\nseveral feet apart, glaring at each other. And then, just as suddenly,\r\nlike the sun rising on a stormy sea, they would begin to laugh. This\r\nwould always culminate with the master\xe2\x80\x99s arms going around White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck and shoulders while the latter crooned and growled his love-song.\r\n\r\nBut nobody else ever romped with White Fang. He did not permit it. He\r\nstood on his dignity, and when they attempted it, his warning snarl and\r\nbristling mane were anything but playful. That he allowed the master\r\nthese liberties was no reason that he should be a common dog, loving\r\nhere and loving there, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s property for a romp and good time.\r\nHe loved with single heart and refused to cheapen himself or his love.\r\n\r\nThe master went out on horseback a great deal, and to accompany him was\r\none of White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s chief duties in life. In the Northland he had\r\nevidenced his fealty by toiling in the harness; but there were no sleds\r\nin the Southland, nor did dogs pack burdens on their backs. So he\r\nrendered fealty in the new way, by running with the master\xe2\x80\x99s horse. The\r\nlongest day never played White Fang out. His was the gait of the wolf,\r\nsmooth, tireless and effortless, and at the end of fifty miles he would\r\ncome in jauntily ahead of the horse.\r\n\r\nIt was in connection with the riding, that White Fang achieved one\r\nother mode of expression\xe2\x80\x94remarkable in that he did it but twice in all\r\nhis life. The first time occurred when the master was trying to teach a\r\nspirited thoroughbred the method of opening and closing gates without\r\nthe rider\xe2\x80\x99s dismounting. Time and again and many times he ranged the\r\nhorse up to the gate in the effort to close it and each time the horse\r\nbecame frightened and backed and plunged away. It grew more nervous and\r\nexcited every moment. When it reared, the master put the spurs to it\r\nand made it drop its fore-legs back to earth, whereupon it would begin\r\nkicking with its hind-legs. White Fang watched the performance with\r\nincreasing anxiety until he could contain himself no longer, when he\r\nsprang in front of the horse and barked savagely and warningly.\r\n\r\nThough he often tried to bark thereafter, and the master encouraged\r\nhim, he succeeded only once, and then it was not in the master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence. A scamper across the pasture, a jackrabbit rising suddenly\r\nunder the horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet, a violent sheer, a stumble, a fall to earth,\r\nand a broken leg for the master, was the cause of it. White Fang sprang\r\nin a rage at the throat of the offending horse, but was checked by the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome! Go home!\xe2\x80\x9d the master commanded when he had ascertained his\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang was disinclined to desert him. The master thought of writing\r\na note, but searched his pockets vainly for pencil and paper. Again he\r\ncommanded White Fang to go home.\r\n\r\nThe latter regarded him wistfully, started away, then returned and\r\nwhined softly. The master talked to him gently but seriously, and he\r\ncocked his ears, and listened with painful intentness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, old fellow, you just run along home,\xe2\x80\x9d ran the talk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on home and tell them what\xe2\x80\x99s happened to me. Home with you, you\r\nwolf. Get along home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang knew the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9chome,\xe2\x80\x9d and though he did not understand\r\nthe remainder of the master\xe2\x80\x99s language, he knew it was his will that he\r\nshould go home. He turned and trotted reluctantly away. Then he\r\nstopped, undecided, and looked back over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo home!\xe2\x80\x9d came the sharp command, and this time he obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe family was on the porch, taking the cool of the afternoon, when\r\nWhite Fang arrived. He came in among them, panting, covered with dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeedon\xe2\x80\x99s back,\xe2\x80\x9d Weedon\xe2\x80\x99s mother announced.\r\n\r\nThe children welcomed White Fang with glad cries and ran to meet him.\r\nHe avoided them and passed down the porch, but they cornered him\r\nagainst a rocking-chair and the railing. He growled and tried to push\r\nby them. Their mother looked apprehensively in their direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess, he makes me nervous around the children,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\na dread that he will turn upon them unexpectedly some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrowling savagely, White Fang sprang out of the corner, overturning the\r\nboy and the girl. The mother called them to her and comforted them,\r\ntelling them not to bother White Fang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wolf is a wolf!\xe2\x80\x9d commented Judge Scott. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no trusting one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is not all wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Beth, standing for her brother in\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have only Weedon\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for that,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the judge. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nmerely surmises that there is some strain of dog in White Fang; but as\r\nhe will tell you himself, he knows nothing about it. As for his\r\nappearance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not finish his sentence. White Fang stood before him, growling\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away! Lie down, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Scott commanded.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang turned to the love-master\xe2\x80\x99s wife. She screamed with fright\r\nas he seized her dress in his teeth and dragged on it till the frail\r\nfabric tore away. By this time he had become the centre of interest.\r\n\r\nHe had ceased from his growling and stood, head up, looking into their\r\nfaces. His throat worked spasmodically, but made no sound, while he\r\nstruggled with all his body, convulsed with the effort to rid himself\r\nof the incommunicable something that strained for utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he is not going mad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Weedon\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cI told Weedon that\r\nI was afraid the warm climate would not agree with an Arctic animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s trying to speak, I do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d Beth announced.\r\n\r\nAt this moment speech came to White Fang, rushing up in a great burst\r\nof barking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething has happened to Weedon,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife said decisively.\r\n\r\nThey were all on their feet now, and White Fang ran down the steps,\r\nlooking back for them to follow. For the second and last time in his\r\nlife he had barked and made himself understood.\r\n\r\nAfter this event he found a warmer place in the hearts of the Sierra\r\nVista people, and even the groom whose arm he had slashed admitted that\r\nhe was a wise dog even if he was a wolf. Judge Scott still held to the\r\nsame opinion, and proved it to everybody\xe2\x80\x99s dissatisfaction by\r\nmeasurements and descriptions taken from the encyclopaedia and various\r\nworks on natural history.\r\n\r\nThe days came and went, streaming their unbroken sunshine over the\r\nSanta Clara Valley. But as they grew shorter and White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s second\r\nwinter in the Southland came on, he made a strange discovery. Collie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nteeth were no longer sharp. There was a playfulness about her nips and\r\na gentleness that prevented them from really hurting him. He forgot\r\nthat she had made life a burden to him, and when she disported herself\r\naround him he responded solemnly, striving to be playful and becoming\r\nno more than ridiculous.\r\n\r\nOne day she led him off on a long chase through the back-pasture land\r\ninto the woods. It was the afternoon that the master was to ride, and\r\nWhite Fang knew it. The horse stood saddled and waiting at the door.\r\nWhite Fang hesitated. But there was that in him deeper than all the law\r\nhe had learned, than the customs that had moulded him, than his love\r\nfor the master, than the very will to live of himself; and when, in the\r\nmoment of his indecision, Collie nipped him and scampered off, he\r\nturned and followed after. The master rode alone that day; and in the\r\nwoods, side by side, White Fang ran with Collie, as his mother, Kiche,\r\nand old One Eye had run long years before in the silent Northland\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE SLEEPING WOLF\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the newspapers were full of the daring\r\nescape of a convict from San Quentin prison. He was a ferocious man. He\r\nhad been ill-made in the making. He had not been born right, and he had\r\nnot been helped any by the moulding he had received at the hands of\r\nsociety. The hands of society are harsh, and this man was a striking\r\nsample of its handiwork. He was a beast\xe2\x80\x94a human beast, it is true, but\r\nnevertheless so terrible a beast that he can best be characterised as\r\ncarnivorous.\r\n\r\nIn San Quentin prison he had proved incorrigible. Punishment failed to\r\nbreak his spirit. He could die dumb-mad and fighting to the last, but\r\nhe could not live and be beaten. The more fiercely he fought, the more\r\nharshly society handled him, and the only effect of harshness was to\r\nmake him fiercer. Strait-jackets, starvation, and beatings and\r\nclubbings were the wrong treatment for Jim Hall; but it was the\r\ntreatment he received. It was the treatment he had received from the\r\ntime he was a little pulpy boy in a San Francisco slum\xe2\x80\x94soft clay in the\r\nhands of society and ready to be formed into something.\r\n\r\nIt was during Jim Hall\xe2\x80\x99s third term in prison that he encountered a\r\nguard that was almost as great a beast as he. The guard treated him\r\nunfairly, lied about him to the warden, lost his credits, persecuted\r\nhim. The difference between them was that the guard carried a bunch of\r\nkeys and a revolver. Jim Hall had only his naked hands and his teeth.\r\nBut he sprang upon the guard one day and used his teeth on the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthroat just like any jungle animal.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Jim Hall went to live in the incorrigible cell. He lived\r\nthere three years. The cell was of iron, the floor, the walls, the\r\nroof. He never left this cell. He never saw the sky nor the sunshine.\r\nDay was a twilight and night was a black silence. He was in an iron\r\ntomb, buried alive. He saw no human face, spoke to no human thing. When\r\nhis food was shoved in to him, he growled like a wild animal. He hated\r\nall things. For days and nights he bellowed his rage at the universe.\r\nFor weeks and months he never made a sound, in the black silence eating\r\nhis very soul. He was a man and a monstrosity, as fearful a thing of\r\nfear as ever gibbered in the visions of a maddened brain.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one night, he escaped. The warders said it was impossible,\r\nbut nevertheless the cell was empty, and half in half out of it lay the\r\nbody of a dead guard. Two other dead guards marked his trail through\r\nthe prison to the outer walls, and he had killed with his hands to\r\navoid noise.\r\n\r\nHe was armed with the weapons of the slain guards\xe2\x80\x94a live arsenal that\r\nfled through the hills pursued by the organised might of society. A\r\nheavy price of gold was upon his head. Avaricious farmers hunted him\r\nwith shot-guns. His blood might pay off a mortgage or send a son to\r\ncollege. Public-spirited citizens took down their rifles and went out\r\nafter him. A pack of bloodhounds followed the way of his bleeding feet.\r\nAnd the sleuth-hounds of the law, the paid fighting animals of society,\r\nwith telephone, and telegraph, and special train, clung to his trail\r\nnight and day.\r\n\r\nSometimes they came upon him, and men faced him like heroes, or\r\nstampeded through barbed-wire fences to the delight of the commonwealth\r\nreading the account at the breakfast table. It was after such\r\nencounters that the dead and wounded were carted back to the towns, and\r\ntheir places filled by men eager for the man-hunt.\r\n\r\nAnd then Jim Hall disappeared. The bloodhounds vainly quested on the\r\nlost trail. Inoffensive ranchers in remote valleys were held up by\r\narmed men and compelled to identify themselves. While the remains of\r\nJim Hall were discovered on a dozen mountain-sides by greedy claimants\r\nfor blood-money.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the newspapers were read at Sierra Vista, not so much\r\nwith interest as with anxiety. The women were afraid. Judge Scott\r\npooh-poohed and laughed, but not with reason, for it was in his last\r\ndays on the bench that Jim Hall had stood before him and received\r\nsentence. And in open court-room, before all men, Jim Hall had\r\nproclaimed that the day would come when he would wreak vengeance on the\r\nJudge that sentenced him.\r\n\r\nFor once, Jim Hall was right. He was innocent of the crime for which he\r\nwas sentenced. It was a case, in the parlance of thieves and police, of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crail-roading.\xe2\x80\x9d Jim Hall was being \xe2\x80\x9crail-roaded\xe2\x80\x9d to prison for a crime\r\nhe had not committed. Because of the two prior convictions against him,\r\nJudge Scott imposed upon him a sentence of fifty years.\r\n\r\nJudge Scott did not know all things, and he did not know that he was\r\nparty to a police conspiracy, that the evidence was hatched and\r\nperjured, that Jim Hall was guiltless of the crime charged. And Jim\r\nHall, on the other hand, did not know that Judge Scott was merely\r\nignorant. Jim Hall believed that the judge knew all about it and was\r\nhand in glove with the police in the perpetration of the monstrous\r\ninjustice. So it was, when the doom of fifty years of living death was\r\nuttered by Judge Scott, that Jim Hall, hating all things in the society\r\nthat misused him, rose up and raged in the court-room until dragged\r\ndown by half a dozen of his blue-coated enemies. To him, Judge Scott\r\nwas the keystone in the arch of injustice, and upon Judge Scott he\r\nemptied the vials of his wrath and hurled the threats of his revenge\r\nyet to come. Then Jim Hall went to his living death . . . and escaped.\r\n\r\nOf all this White Fang knew nothing. But between him and Alice, the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s wife, there existed a secret. Each night, after Sierra Vista\r\nhad gone to bed, she rose and let in White Fang to sleep in the big\r\nhall. Now White Fang was not a house-dog, nor was he permitted to sleep\r\nin the house; so each morning, early, she slipped down and let him out\r\nbefore the family was awake.\r\n\r\nOn one such night, while all the house slept, White Fang awoke and lay\r\nvery quietly. And very quietly he smelled the air and read the message\r\nit bore of a strange god\xe2\x80\x99s presence. And to his ears came sounds of the\r\nstrange god\xe2\x80\x99s movements. White Fang burst into no furious outcry. It\r\nwas not his way. The strange god walked softly, but more softly walked\r\nWhite Fang, for he had no clothes to rub against the flesh of his body.\r\nHe followed silently. In the Wild he had hunted live meat that was\r\ninfinitely timid, and he knew the advantage of surprise.\r\n\r\nThe strange god paused at the foot of the great staircase and listened,\r\nand White Fang was as dead, so without movement was he as he watched\r\nand waited. Up that staircase the way led to the love-master and to the\r\nlove-master\xe2\x80\x99s dearest possessions. White Fang bristled, but waited. The\r\nstrange god\xe2\x80\x99s foot lifted. He was beginning the ascent.\r\n\r\nThen it was that White Fang struck. He gave no warning, with no snarl\r\nanticipated his own action. Into the air he lifted his body in the\r\nspring that landed him on the strange god\xe2\x80\x99s back. White Fang clung with\r\nhis fore-paws to the man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, at the same time burying his\r\nfangs into the back of the man\xe2\x80\x99s neck. He clung on for a moment, long\r\nenough to drag the god over backward. Together they crashed to the\r\nfloor. White Fang leaped clear, and, as the man struggled to rise, was\r\nin again with the slashing fangs.\r\n\r\nSierra Vista awoke in alarm. The noise from downstairs was as that of a\r\nscore of battling fiends. There were revolver shots. A man\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nscreamed once in horror and anguish. There was a great snarling and\r\ngrowling, and over all arose a smashing and crashing of furniture and\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nBut almost as quickly as it had arisen, the commotion died away. The\r\nstruggle had not lasted more than three minutes. The frightened\r\nhousehold clustered at the top of the stairway. From below, as from out\r\nan abyss of blackness, came up a gurgling sound, as of air bubbling\r\nthrough water. Sometimes this gurgle became sibilant, almost a whistle.\r\nBut this, too, quickly died down and ceased. Then naught came up out of\r\nthe blackness save a heavy panting of some creature struggling sorely\r\nfor air.\r\n\r\nWeedon Scott pressed a button, and the staircase and downstairs hall\r\nwere flooded with light. Then he and Judge Scott, revolvers in hand,\r\ncautiously descended. There was no need for this caution. White Fang\r\nhad done his work. In the midst of the wreckage of overthrown and\r\nsmashed furniture, partly on his side, his face hidden by an arm, lay a\r\nman. Weedon Scott bent over, removed the arm and turned the man\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nupward. A gaping throat explained the manner of his death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Judge Scott, and father and son looked significantly\r\nat each other.\r\n\r\nThen they turned to White Fang. He, too, was lying on his side. His\r\neyes were closed, but the lids slightly lifted in an effort to look at\r\nthem as they bent over him, and the tail was perceptibly agitated in a\r\nvain effort to wag. Weedon Scott patted him, and his throat rumbled an\r\nacknowledging growl. But it was a weak growl at best, and it quickly\r\nceased. His eyelids drooped and went shut, and his whole body seemed to\r\nrelax and flatten out upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s all in, poor devil,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see about that,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted the Judge, as he started for the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrankly, he has one chance in a thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d announced the surgeon,\r\nafter he had worked an hour and a half on White Fang.\r\n\r\nDawn was breaking through the windows and dimming the electric lights.\r\nWith the exception of the children, the whole family was gathered about\r\nthe surgeon to hear his verdict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne broken hind-leg,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThree broken ribs, one at least of\r\nwhich has pierced the lungs. He has lost nearly all the blood in his\r\nbody. There is a large likelihood of internal injuries. He must have\r\nbeen jumped upon. To say nothing of three bullet holes clear through\r\nhim. One chance in a thousand is really optimistic. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a chance\r\nin ten thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t lose any chance that might be of help to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge\r\nScott exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind expense. Put him under the X-ray\xe2\x80\x94anything.\r\nWeedon, telegraph at once to San Francisco for Doctor Nichols. No\r\nreflection on you, doctor, you understand; but he must have the\r\nadvantage of every chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon smiled indulgently. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I understand. He deserves\r\nall that can be done for him. He must be nursed as you would nurse a\r\nhuman being, a sick child. And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget what I told you about\r\ntemperature. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite Fang received the nursing. Judge Scott\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion of a trained\r\nnurse was indignantly clamoured down by the girls, who themselves\r\nundertook the task. And White Fang won out on the one chance in ten\r\nthousand denied him by the surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe latter was not to be censured for his misjudgment. All his life he\r\nhad tended and operated on the soft humans of civilisation, who lived\r\nsheltered lives and had descended out of many sheltered generations.\r\nCompared with White Fang, they were frail and flabby, and clutched life\r\nwithout any strength in their grip. White Fang had come straight from\r\nthe Wild, where the weak perish early and shelter is vouchsafed to\r\nnone. In neither his father nor his mother was there any weakness, nor\r\nin the generations before them. A constitution of iron and the vitality\r\nof the Wild were White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance, and he clung to life, the\r\nwhole of him and every part of him, in spirit and in flesh, with the\r\ntenacity that of old belonged to all creatures.\r\n\r\nBound down a prisoner, denied even movement by the plaster casts and\r\nbandages, White Fang lingered out the weeks. He slept long hours and\r\ndreamed much, and through his mind passed an unending pageant of\r\nNorthland visions. All the ghosts of the past arose and were with him.\r\nOnce again he lived in the lair with Kiche, crept trembling to the\r\nknees of Grey Beaver to tender his allegiance, ran for his life before\r\nLip-lip and all the howling bedlam of the puppy-pack.\r\n\r\nHe ran again through the silence, hunting his living food through the\r\nmonths of famine; and again he ran at the head of the team, the\r\ngut-whips of Mit-sah and Grey Beaver snapping behind, their voices\r\ncrying \xe2\x80\x9cRa! Raa!\xe2\x80\x9d when they came to a narrow passage and the team\r\nclosed together like a fan to go through. He lived again all his days\r\nwith Beauty Smith and the fights he had fought. At such times he\r\nwhimpered and snarled in his sleep, and they that looked on said that\r\nhis dreams were bad.\r\n\r\nBut there was one particular nightmare from which he suffered\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nclanking, clanging monsters of electric cars that were to him colossal\r\nscreaming lynxes. He would lie in a screen of bushes, watching for a\r\nsquirrel to venture far enough out on the ground from its tree-refuge.\r\nThen, when he sprang out upon it, it would transform itself into an\r\nelectric car, menacing and terrible, towering over him like a mountain,\r\nscreaming and clanging and spitting fire at him. It was the same when\r\nhe challenged the hawk down out of the sky. Down out of the blue it\r\nwould rush, as it dropped upon him changing itself into the ubiquitous\r\nelectric car. Or again, he would be in the pen of Beauty Smith. Outside\r\nthe pen, men would be gathering, and he knew that a fight was on. He\r\nwatched the door for his antagonist to enter. The door would open, and\r\nthrust in upon him would come the awful electric car. A thousand times\r\nthis occurred, and each time the terror it inspired was as vivid and\r\ngreat as ever.\r\n\r\nThen came the day when the last bandage and the last plaster cast were\r\ntaken off. It was a gala day. All Sierra Vista was gathered around. The\r\nmaster rubbed his ears, and he crooned his love-growl. The master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife called him the \xe2\x80\x9cBlessed Wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d which name was taken up with\r\nacclaim and all the women called him the Blessed Wolf.\r\n\r\nHe tried to rise to his feet, and after several attempts fell down from\r\nweakness. He had lain so long that his muscles had lost their cunning,\r\nand all the strength had gone out of them. He felt a little shame\r\nbecause of his weakness, as though, forsooth, he were failing the gods\r\nin the service he owed them. Because of this he made heroic efforts to\r\narise and at last he stood on his four legs, tottering and swaying back\r\nand forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Blessed Wolf!\xe2\x80\x9d chorused the women.\r\n\r\nJudge Scott surveyed them triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of your own mouths be it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as I contended right\r\nalong. No mere dog could have done what he did. He\xe2\x80\x99s a wolf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Blessed Wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d amended the Judge\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Blessed Wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the Judge. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd henceforth that shall be my\r\nname for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to learn to walk again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon; \xe2\x80\x9cso he might as\r\nwell start in right now. It won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him. Take him outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd outside he went, like a king, with all Sierra Vista about him and\r\ntending on him. He was very weak, and when he reached the lawn he lay\r\ndown and rested for a while.\r\n\r\nThen the procession started on, little spurts of strength coming into\r\nWhite Fang\xe2\x80\x99s muscles as he used them and the blood began to surge\r\nthrough them. The stables were reached, and there in the doorway, lay\r\nCollie, a half-dozen pudgy puppies playing about her in the sun.\r\n\r\nWhite Fang looked on with a wondering eye. Collie snarled warningly at\r\nhim, and he was careful to keep his distance. The master with his toe\r\nhelped one sprawling puppy toward him. He bristled suspiciously, but\r\nthe master warned him that all was well. Collie, clasped in the arms of\r\none of the women, watched him jealously and with a snarl warned him\r\nthat all was not well.\r\n\r\nThe puppy sprawled in front of him. He cocked his ears and watched it\r\ncuriously. Then their noses touched, and he felt the warm little tongue\r\nof the puppy on his jowl. White Fang\xe2\x80\x99s tongue went out, he knew not\r\nwhy, and he licked the puppy\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nHand-clapping and pleased cries from the gods greeted the performance.\r\nHe was surprised, and looked at them in a puzzled way. Then his\r\nweakness asserted itself, and he lay down, his ears cocked, his head on\r\none side, as he watched the puppy. The other puppies came sprawling\r\ntoward him, to Collie\xe2\x80\x99s great disgust; and he gravely permitted them to\r\nclamber and tumble over him. At first, amid the applause of the gods,\r\nhe betrayed a trifle of his old self-consciousness and awkwardness.\r\nThis passed away as the puppies\xe2\x80\x99 antics and mauling continued, and he\r\nlay with half-shut patient eyes, drowsing in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHITE FANG ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
