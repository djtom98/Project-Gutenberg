Somerset Maugham\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day broke gray and dull. The clouds hung heavily, and there was a\r\nrawness in the air that suggested snow. A woman servant came into a\r\nroom in which a child was sleeping and drew the curtains. She glanced\r\nmechanically at the house opposite, a stucco house with a portico, and\r\nwent to the child\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake up, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe pulled down the bed-clothes, took him in her arms, and carried him\r\ndownstairs. He was only half awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother wants you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door of a room on the floor below and took the child\r\nover to a bed in which a woman was lying. It was his mother. She\r\nstretched out her arms, and the child nestled by her side. He did not\r\nask why he had been awakened. The woman kissed his eyes, and with thin,\r\nsmall hands felt the warm body through his white flannel nightgown. She\r\npressed him closer to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sleepy, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHer voice was so weak that it seemed to come already from a great\r\ndistance. The child did not answer, but smiled comfortably. He was very\r\nhappy in the large, warm bed, with those soft arms about him. He tried\r\nto make himself smaller still as he cuddled up against his mother, and\r\nhe kissed her sleepily. In a moment he closed his eyes and was fast\r\nasleep. The doctor came forwards and stood by the bed-side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t take him away yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, without answering, looked at her gravely. Knowing she would\r\nnot be allowed to keep the child much longer, the woman kissed him\r\nagain; and she passed her hand down his body till she came to his feet;\r\nshe held the right foot in her hand and felt the five small toes; and\r\nthen slowly passed her hand over the left one. She gave a sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, unable to speak, and the tears rolled down her\r\ncheeks. The doctor bent down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me take him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was too weak to resist his wish, and she gave the child up. The\r\ndoctor handed him back to his nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better put him back in his own bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d The little boy, still sleeping, was taken away. His\r\nmother sobbed now broken-heartedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will happen to him, poor child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe monthly nurse tried to quiet her, and presently, from exhaustion,\r\nthe crying ceased. The doctor walked to a table on the other side of\r\nthe room, upon which, under a towel, lay the body of a still-born\r\nchild. He lifted the towel and looked. He was hidden from the bed by a\r\nscreen, but the woman guessed what he was doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it a girl or a boy?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to the nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman did not answer. In a moment the child\xe2\x80\x99s nurse came back. She\r\napproached the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Philip never woke up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. There was a pause. Then the\r\ndoctor felt his patient\xe2\x80\x99s pulse once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I can do just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call\r\nagain after breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you out, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child\xe2\x80\x99s nurse.\r\n\r\nThey walked downstairs in silence. In the hall the doctor stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve sent for Mrs. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know at what time he\xe2\x80\x99ll be here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting a telegram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the little boy? I should think he\xe2\x80\x99d be better out of the\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Watkin said she\xe2\x80\x99d take him, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s his godmother, sir. D\xe2\x80\x99you think Mrs. Carey will get over it,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a week later. Philip was sitting on the floor in the\r\ndrawing-room at Miss Watkin\xe2\x80\x99s house in Onslow gardens. He was an only\r\nchild and used to amusing himself. The room was filled with massive\r\nfurniture, and on each of the sofas were three big cushions. There was\r\na cushion too in each arm-chair. All these he had taken and, with the\r\nhelp of the gilt rout chairs, light and easy to move, had made an\r\nelaborate cave in which he could hide himself from the Red Indians who\r\nwere lurking behind the curtains. He put his ear to the floor and\r\nlistened to the herd of buffaloes that raced across the prairie.\r\nPresently, hearing the door open, he held his breath so that he might\r\nnot be discovered; but a violent hand pulled away a chair and the\r\ncushions fell down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou naughty boy, Miss Watkin WILL be cross with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa, Emma!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe nurse bent down and kissed him, then began to shake out the\r\ncushions, and put them back in their places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to come home?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to fetch you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a new dress on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in eighteen-eighty-five, and she wore a bustle. Her gown was of\r\nblack velvet, with tight sleeves and sloping shoulders, and the skirt\r\nhad three large flounces. She wore a black bonnet with velvet strings.\r\nShe hesitated. The question she had expected did not come, and so she\r\ncould not give the answer she had prepared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to ask how your mamma is?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I forgot. How is mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow she was ready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mamma is quite well and happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mamma\xe2\x80\x99s gone away. You won\xe2\x80\x99t ever see her any more.\xe2\x80\x9d Philip did\r\nnot know what she meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mamma\xe2\x80\x99s in heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to cry, and Philip, though he did not quite understand, cried\r\ntoo. Emma was a tall, big-boned woman, with fair hair and large\r\nfeatures. She came from Devonshire and, notwithstanding her many years\r\nof service in London, had never lost the breadth of her accent. Her\r\ntears increased her emotion, and she pressed the little boy to her\r\nheart. She felt vaguely the pity of that child deprived of the only\r\nlove in the world that is quite unselfish. It seemed dreadful that he\r\nmust be handed over to strangers. But in a little while she pulled\r\nherself together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Uncle William is waiting in to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and say\r\ngood-bye to Miss Watkin, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, instinctively anxious to\r\nhide his tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, run upstairs and get your hat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fetched it, and when he came down Emma was waiting for him in the\r\nhall. He heard the sound of voices in the study behind the dining-room.\r\nHe paused. He knew that Miss Watkin and her sister were talking to\r\nfriends, and it seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94he was nine years old\xe2\x80\x94that if he went in\r\nthey would be sorry for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and say good-bye to Miss Watkin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in and tell them I\xe2\x80\x99m coming,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe wished to make the most of his opportunity. Emma knocked at the door\r\nand walked in. He heard her speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Philip wants to say good-bye to you, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden hush of the conversation, and Philip limped in.\r\nHenrietta Watkin was a stout woman, with a red face and dyed hair. In\r\nthose days to dye the hair excited comment, and Philip had heard much\r\ngossip at home when his godmother\xe2\x80\x99s changed colour. She lived with an\r\nelder sister, who had resigned herself contentedly to old age. Two\r\nladies, whom Philip did not know, were calling, and they looked at him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Watkin, opening her arms.\r\n\r\nShe began to cry. Philip understood now why she had not been in to\r\nluncheon and why she wore a black dress. She could not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, at last.\r\n\r\nHe disengaged himself from Miss Watkin\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and she kissed him\r\nagain. Then he went to her sister and bade her good-bye too. One of the\r\nstrange ladies asked if she might kiss him, and he gravely gave her\r\npermission. Though crying, he keenly enjoyed the sensation he was\r\ncausing; he would have been glad to stay a little longer to be made\r\nmuch of, but felt they expected him to go, so he said that Emma was\r\nwaiting for him. He went out of the room. Emma had gone downstairs to\r\nspeak with a friend in the basement, and he waited for her on the\r\nlanding. He heard Henrietta Watkin\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis mother was my greatest friend. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think that she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have gone to the funeral, Henrietta,\xe2\x80\x9d said her sister.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it would upset you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen one of the strangers spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little boy, it\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful to think of him quite alone in the\r\nworld. I see he limps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a club-foot. It was such a grief to his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Emma came back. They called a hansom, and she told the driver\r\nwhere to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the house Mrs. Carey had died in\xe2\x80\x94it was in a dreary,\r\nrespectable street between Notting Hill Gate and High Street,\r\nKensington\xe2\x80\x94Emma led Philip into the drawing-room. His uncle was writing\r\nletters of thanks for the wreaths which had been sent. One of them,\r\nwhich had arrived too late for the funeral, lay in its cardboard box on\r\nthe hall-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Master Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey stood up slowly and shook hands with the little boy. Then on\r\nsecond thoughts he bent down and kissed his forehead. He was a man of\r\nsomewhat less than average height, inclined to corpulence, with his\r\nhair, worn long, arranged over the scalp so as to conceal his baldness.\r\nHe was clean-shaven. His features were regular, and it was possible to\r\nimagine that in his youth he had been good-looking. On his watch-chain\r\nhe wore a gold cross.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to live with me now, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carey. \xe2\x80\x9cShall you\r\nlike that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo years before Philip had been sent down to stay at the vicarage\r\nafter an attack of chicken-pox; but there remained with him a\r\nrecollection of an attic and a large garden rather than of his uncle\r\nand aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must look upon me and your Aunt Louisa as your father and mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child\xe2\x80\x99s mouth trembled a little, he reddened, but did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour dear mother left you in my charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey had no great ease in expressing himself. When the news came\r\nthat his sister-in-law was dying, he set off at once for London, but on\r\nthe way thought of nothing but the disturbance in his life that would\r\nbe caused if her death forced him to undertake the care of her son. He\r\nwas well over fifty, and his wife, to whom he had been married for\r\nthirty years, was childless; he did not look forward with any pleasure\r\nto the presence of a small boy who might be noisy and rough. He had\r\nnever much liked his sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to take you down to Blackstable tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Emma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child put his hand in hers, and she pressed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid Emma must go away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want Emma to come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip began to cry, and the nurse could not help crying too. Mr. Carey\r\nlooked at them helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d better leave me alone with Master Philip for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough Philip clung to her, she released herself gently. Mr. Carey took\r\nthe boy on his knee and put his arm round him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t cry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too old to have a nurse now. We\r\nmust see about sending you to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want Emma to come with me,\xe2\x80\x9d the child repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt costs too much money, Philip. Your father didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave very much,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s become of it. You must look at every penny you\r\nspend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey had called the day before on the family solicitor. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather was a surgeon in good practice, and his hospital appointments\r\nsuggested an established position; so that it was a surprise on his\r\nsudden death from blood-poisoning to find that he had left his widow\r\nlittle more than his life insurance and what could be got for the lease\r\nof their house in Bruton Street. This was six months ago; and Mrs.\r\nCarey, already in delicate health, finding herself with child, had lost\r\nher head and accepted for the lease the first offer that was made. She\r\nstored her furniture, and, at a rent which the parson thought\r\noutrageous, took a furnished house for a year, so that she might suffer\r\nfrom no inconvenience till her child was born. But she had never been\r\nused to the management of money, and was unable to adapt her\r\nexpenditure to her altered circumstances. The little she had slipped\r\nthrough her fingers in one way and another, so that now, when all\r\nexpenses were paid, not much more than two thousand pounds remained to\r\nsupport the boy till he was able to earn his own living. It was\r\nimpossible to explain all this to Philip and he was sobbing still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better go to Emma,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Carey said, feeling that she could\r\nconsole the child better than anyone.\r\n\r\nWithout a word Philip slipped off his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s knee, but Mr. Carey\r\nstopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go tomorrow, because on Saturday I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to prepare my\r\nsermon, and you must tell Emma to get your things ready today. You can\r\nbring all your toys. And if you want anything to remember your father\r\nand mother by you can take one thing for each of them. Everything else\r\nis going to be sold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy slipped out of the room. Mr. Carey was unused to work, and he\r\nturned to his correspondence with resentment. On one side of the desk\r\nwas a bundle of bills, and these filled him with irritation. One\r\nespecially seemed preposterous. Immediately after Mrs. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nEmma had ordered from the florist masses of white flowers for the room\r\nin which the dead woman lay. It was sheer waste of money. Emma took far\r\ntoo much upon herself. Even if there had been no financial necessity,\r\nhe would have dismissed her.\r\n\r\nBut Philip went to her, and hid his face in her bosom, and wept as\r\nthough his heart would break. And she, feeling that he was almost her\r\nown son\xe2\x80\x94she had taken him when he was a month old\xe2\x80\x94consoled him with\r\nsoft words. She promised that she would come and see him sometimes, and\r\nthat she would never forget him; and she told him about the country he\r\nwas going to and about her own home in Devonshire\xe2\x80\x94her father kept a\r\nturnpike on the high-road that led to Exeter, and there were pigs in\r\nthe sty, and there was a cow, and the cow had just had a calf\xe2\x80\x94till\r\nPhilip forgot his tears and grew excited at the thought of his\r\napproaching journey. Presently she put him down, for there was much to\r\nbe done, and he helped her to lay out his clothes on the bed. She sent\r\nhim into the nursery to gather up his toys, and in a little while he\r\nwas playing happily.\r\n\r\nBut at last he grew tired of being alone and went back to the bed-room,\r\nin which Emma was now putting his things into a big tin box; he\r\nremembered then that his uncle had said he might take something to\r\nremember his father and mother by. He told Emma and asked her what he\r\nshould take.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better go into the drawing-room and see what you fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle William\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. They\xe2\x80\x99re your own things now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip went downstairs slowly and found the door open. Mr. Carey had\r\nleft the room. Philip walked slowly round. They had been in the house\r\nso short a time that there was little in it that had a particular\r\ninterest to him. It was a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s room, and Philip saw nothing that\r\nstruck his fancy. But he knew which were his mother\xe2\x80\x99s things and which\r\nbelonged to the landlord, and presently fixed on a little clock that he\r\nhad once heard his mother say she liked. With this he walked again\r\nrather disconsolately upstairs. Outside the door of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed-room he stopped and listened. Though no one had told him not to go\r\nin, he had a feeling that it would be wrong to do so; he was a little\r\nfrightened, and his heart beat uncomfortably; but at the same time\r\nsomething impelled him to turn the handle. He turned it very gently, as\r\nif to prevent anyone within from hearing, and then slowly pushed the\r\ndoor open. He stood on the threshold for a moment before he had the\r\ncourage to enter. He was not frightened now, but it seemed strange. He\r\nclosed the door behind him. The blinds were drawn, and the room, in the\r\ncold light of a January afternoon, was dark. On the dressing-table were\r\nMrs. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s brushes and the hand mirror. In a little tray were\r\nhairpins. There was a photograph of himself on the chimney-piece and\r\none of his father. He had often been in the room when his mother was\r\nnot in it, but now it seemed different. There was something curious in\r\nthe look of the chairs. The bed was made as though someone were going\r\nto sleep in it that night, and in a case on the pillow was a\r\nnight-dress.\r\n\r\nPhilip opened a large cupboard filled with dresses and, stepping in,\r\ntook as many of them as he could in his arms and buried his face in\r\nthem. They smelt of the scent his mother used. Then he pulled open the\r\ndrawers, filled with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s things, and looked at them: there\r\nwere lavender bags among the linen, and their scent was fresh and\r\npleasant. The strangeness of the room left it, and it seemed to him\r\nthat his mother had just gone out for a walk. She would be in presently\r\nand would come upstairs to have nursery tea with him. And he seemed to\r\nfeel her kiss on his lips.\r\n\r\nIt was not true that he would never see her again. It was not true\r\nsimply because it was impossible. He climbed up on the bed and put his\r\nhead on the pillow. He lay there quite still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip parted from Emma with tears, but the journey to Blackstable\r\namused him, and, when they arrived, he was resigned and cheerful.\r\nBlackstable was sixty miles from London. Giving their luggage to a\r\nporter, Mr. Carey set out to walk with Philip to the vicarage; it took\r\nthem little more than five minutes, and, when they reached it, Philip\r\nsuddenly remembered the gate. It was red and five-barred: it swung both\r\nways on easy hinges; and it was possible, though forbidden, to swing\r\nbackwards and forwards on it. They walked through the garden to the\r\nfront-door. This was only used by visitors and on Sundays, and on\r\nspecial occasions, as when the Vicar went up to London or came back.\r\nThe traffic of the house took place through a side-door, and there was\r\na back door as well for the gardener and for beggars and tramps. It was\r\na fairly large house of yellow brick, with a red roof, built about five\r\nand twenty years before in an ecclesiastical style. The front-door was\r\nlike a church porch, and the drawing-room windows were gothic.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey, knowing by what train they were coming, waited in the\r\ndrawing-room and listened for the click of the gate. When she heard it\r\nshe went to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Aunt Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carey, when he saw her. \xe2\x80\x9cRun and give\r\nher a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip started to run, awkwardly, trailing his club-foot, and then\r\nstopped. Mrs. Carey was a little, shrivelled woman of the same age as\r\nher husband, with a face extraordinarily filled with deep wrinkles, and\r\npale blue eyes. Her gray hair was arranged in ringlets according to the\r\nfashion of her youth. She wore a black dress, and her only ornament was\r\na gold chain, from which hung a cross. She had a shy manner and a\r\ngentle voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you walk, William?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost reproachfully, as she kissed\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a glance at his nephew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you to walk, Philip, did it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I always walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a little surprised at their conversation. Aunt Louisa told him\r\nto come in, and they entered the hall. It was paved with red and yellow\r\ntiles, on which alternately were a Greek Cross and the Lamb of God. An\r\nimposing staircase led out of the hall. It was of polished pine, with a\r\npeculiar smell, and had been put in because fortunately, when the\r\nchurch was reseated, enough wood remained over. The balusters were\r\ndecorated with emblems of the Four Evangelists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had the stove lighted as I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be cold after your\r\njourney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Carey.\r\n\r\nIt was a large black stove that stood in the hall and was only lighted\r\nif the weather was very bad and the Vicar had a cold. It was not\r\nlighted if Mrs. Carey had a cold. Coal was expensive. Besides, Mary\r\nAnn, the maid, didn\xe2\x80\x99t like fires all over the place. If they wanted all\r\nthem fires they must keep a second girl. In the winter Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCarey lived in the dining-room so that one fire should do, and in the\r\nsummer they could not get out of the habit, so the drawing-room was\r\nused only by Mr. Carey on Sunday afternoons for his nap. But every\r\nSaturday he had a fire in the study so that he could write his sermon.\r\n\r\nAunt Louisa took Philip upstairs and showed him into a tiny bed-room\r\nthat looked out on the drive. Immediately in front of the window was a\r\nlarge tree, which Philip remembered now because the branches were so\r\nlow that it was possible to climb quite high up it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA small room for a small boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Carey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nfrightened at sleeping alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn his first visit to the vicarage he had come with his nurse, and Mrs.\r\nCarey had had little to do with him. She looked at him now with some\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you wash your own hands, or shall I wash them for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can wash myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall look at them when you come down to tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nCarey.\r\n\r\nShe knew nothing about children. After it was settled that Philip\r\nshould come down to Blackstable, Mrs. Carey had thought much how she\r\nshould treat him; she was anxious to do her duty; but now he was there\r\nshe found herself just as shy of him as he was of her. She hoped he\r\nwould not be noisy and rough, because her husband did not like rough\r\nand noisy boys. Mrs. Carey made an excuse to leave Philip alone, but in\r\na moment came back and knocked at the door; she asked him, without\r\ncoming in, if he could pour out the water himself. Then she went\r\ndownstairs and rang the bell for tea.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room, large and well-proportioned, had windows on two sides\r\nof it, with heavy curtains of red rep; there was a big table in the\r\nmiddle; and at one end an imposing mahogany sideboard with a\r\nlooking-glass in it. In one corner stood a harmonium. On each side of\r\nthe fireplace were chairs covered in stamped leather, each with an\r\nantimacassar; one had arms and was called the husband, and the other\r\nhad none and was called the wife. Mrs. Carey never sat in the\r\narm-chair: she said she preferred a chair that was not too comfortable;\r\nthere was always a lot to do, and if her chair had had arms she might\r\nnot be so ready to leave it.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey was making up the fire when Philip came in, and he pointed\r\nout to his nephew that there were two pokers. One was large and bright\r\nand polished and unused, and was called the Vicar; and the other, which\r\nwas much smaller and had evidently passed through many fires, was\r\ncalled the Curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told Mary Ann to make you an egg. I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be hungry after\r\nyour journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey thought the journey from London to Blackstable very tiring.\r\nShe seldom travelled herself, for the living was only three hundred a\r\nyear, and, when her husband wanted a holiday, since there was not money\r\nfor two, he went by himself. He was very fond of Church Congresses and\r\nusually managed to go up to London once a year; and once he had been to\r\nParis for the exhibition, and two or three times to Switzerland. Mary\r\nAnn brought in the egg, and they sat down. The chair was much too low\r\nfor Philip, and for a moment neither Mr. Carey nor his wife knew what\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put some books under him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Ann.\r\n\r\nShe took from the top of the harmonium the large Bible and the\r\nprayer-book from which the Vicar was accustomed to read prayers, and\r\nput them on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, William, he can\xe2\x80\x99t sit on the Bible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Carey, in a shocked\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you get him some books out of the study?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey considered the question for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters this once if you put the prayer-book on the\r\ntop, Mary Ann,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe book of Common Prayer is the composition\r\nof men like ourselves. It has no claim to divine authorship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that, William,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Louisa.\r\n\r\nPhilip perched himself on the books, and the Vicar, having said grace,\r\ncut the top off his egg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing it to Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can eat my top if you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip would have liked an egg to himself, but he was not offered one,\r\nso took what he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow have the chickens been laying since I went away?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Vicar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been dreadful, only one or two a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you like that top, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have another one on Sunday afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey always had a boiled egg at tea on Sunday, so that he might be\r\nfortified for the evening service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip came gradually to know the people he was to live with, and by\r\nfragments of conversation, some of it not meant for his ears, learned a\r\ngood deal both about himself and about his dead parents. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather had been much younger than the Vicar of Blackstable. After a\r\nbrilliant career at St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital he was put on the staff, and\r\npresently began to earn money in considerable sums. He spent it freely.\r\nWhen the parson set about restoring his church and asked his brother\r\nfor a subscription, he was surprised by receiving a couple of hundred\r\npounds: Mr. Carey, thrifty by inclination and economical by necessity,\r\naccepted it with mingled feelings; he was envious of his brother\r\nbecause he could afford to give so much, pleased for the sake of his\r\nchurch, and vaguely irritated by a generosity which seemed almost\r\nostentatious. Then Henry Carey married a patient, a beautiful girl but\r\npenniless, an orphan with no near relations, but of good family; and\r\nthere was an array of fine friends at the wedding. The parson, on his\r\nvisits to her when he came to London, held himself with reserve. He\r\nfelt shy with her and in his heart he resented her great beauty: she\r\ndressed more magnificently than became the wife of a hardworking\r\nsurgeon; and the charming furniture of her house, the flowers among\r\nwhich she lived even in winter, suggested an extravagance which he\r\ndeplored. He heard her talk of entertainments she was going to; and, as\r\nhe told his wife on getting home again, it was impossible to accept\r\nhospitality without making some return. He had seen grapes in the\r\ndining-room that must have cost at least eight shillings a pound; and\r\nat luncheon he had been given asparagus two months before it was ready\r\nin the vicarage garden. Now all he had anticipated was come to pass:\r\nthe Vicar felt the satisfaction of the prophet who saw fire and\r\nbrimstone consume the city which would not mend its way to his warning.\r\nPoor Philip was practically penniless, and what was the good of his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s fine friends now? He heard that his father\xe2\x80\x99s extravagance was\r\nreally criminal, and it was a mercy that Providence had seen fit to\r\ntake his dear mother to itself: she had no more idea of money than a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip had been a week at Blackstable an incident happened which\r\nseemed to irritate his uncle very much. One morning he found on the\r\nbreakfast table a small packet which had been sent on by post from the\r\nlate Mrs. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s house in London. It was addressed to her. When the\r\nparson opened it he found a dozen photographs of Mrs. Carey. They\r\nshowed the head and shoulders only, and her hair was more plainly done\r\nthan usual, low on the forehead, which gave her an unusual look; the\r\nface was thin and worn, but no illness could impair the beauty of her\r\nfeatures. There was in the large dark eyes a sadness which Philip did\r\nnot remember. The first sight of the dead woman gave Mr. Carey a little\r\nshock, but this was quickly followed by perplexity. The photographs\r\nseemed quite recent, and he could not imagine who had ordered them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know anything about these, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember mamma said she\xe2\x80\x99d been taken,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Watkin\r\nscolded her\xe2\x80\xa6. She said: I wanted the boy to have something to remember\r\nme by when he grows up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey looked at Philip for an instant. The child spoke in a clear\r\ntreble. He recalled the words, but they meant nothing to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better take one of the photographs and keep it in your room,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Carey. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put the others away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sent one to Miss Watkin, and she wrote and explained how they came\r\nto be taken.\r\n\r\nOne day Mrs. Carey was lying in bed, but she was feeling a little\r\nbetter than usual, and the doctor in the morning had seemed hopeful;\r\nEmma had taken the child out, and the maids were downstairs in the\r\nbasement: suddenly Mrs. Carey felt desperately alone in the world. A\r\ngreat fear seized her that she would not recover from the confinement\r\nwhich she was expecting in a fortnight. Her son was nine years old. How\r\ncould he be expected to remember her? She could not bear to think that\r\nhe would grow up and forget, forget her utterly; and she had loved him\r\nso passionately, because he was weakly and deformed, and because he was\r\nher child. She had no photographs of herself taken since her marriage,\r\nand that was ten years before. She wanted her son to know what she\r\nlooked like at the end. He could not forget her then, not forget\r\nutterly. She knew that if she called her maid and told her she wanted\r\nto get up, the maid would prevent her, and perhaps send for the doctor,\r\nand she had not the strength now to struggle or argue. She got out of\r\nbed and began to dress herself. She had been on her back so long that\r\nher legs gave way beneath her, and then the soles of her feet tingled\r\nso that she could hardly bear to put them to the ground. But she went\r\non. She was unused to doing her own hair and, when she raised her arms\r\nand began to brush it, she felt faint. She could never do it as her\r\nmaid did. It was beautiful hair, very fine, and of a deep rich gold.\r\nHer eyebrows were straight and dark. She put on a black skirt, but\r\nchose the bodice of the evening dress which she liked best: it was of a\r\nwhite damask which was fashionable in those days. She looked at herself\r\nin the glass. Her face was very pale, but her skin was clear: she had\r\nnever had much colour, and this had always made the redness of her\r\nbeautiful mouth emphatic. She could not restrain a sob. But she could\r\nnot afford to be sorry for herself; she was feeling already desperately\r\ntired; and she put on the furs which Henry had given her the Christmas\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94she had been so proud of them and so happy then\xe2\x80\x94and slipped\r\ndownstairs with beating heart. She got safely out of the house and\r\ndrove to a photographer. She paid for a dozen photographs. She was\r\nobliged to ask for a glass of water in the middle of the sitting; and\r\nthe assistant, seeing she was ill, suggested that she should come\r\nanother day, but she insisted on staying till the end. At last it was\r\nfinished, and she drove back again to the dingy little house in\r\nKensington which she hated with all her heart. It was a horrible house\r\nto die in.\r\n\r\nShe found the front door open, and when she drove up the maid and Emma\r\nran down the steps to help her. They had been frightened when they\r\nfound her room empty. At first they thought she must have gone to Miss\r\nWatkin, and the cook was sent round. Miss Watkin came back with her and\r\nwas waiting anxiously in the drawing-room. She came downstairs now full\r\nof anxiety and reproaches; but the exertion had been more than Mrs.\r\nCarey was fit for, and when the occasion for firmness no longer existed\r\nshe gave way. She fell heavily into Emma\xe2\x80\x99s arms and was carried\r\nupstairs. She remained unconscious for a time that seemed incredibly\r\nlong to those that watched her, and the doctor, hurriedly sent for, did\r\nnot come. It was next day, when she was a little better, that Miss\r\nWatkin got some explanation out of her. Philip was playing on the floor\r\nof his mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed-room, and neither of the ladies paid attention to\r\nhim. He only understood vaguely what they were talking about, and he\r\ncould not have said why those words remained in his memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted the boy to have something to remember me by when he grows\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make out why she ordered a dozen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carey. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo would\r\nhave done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day was very like another at the vicarage.\r\n\r\nSoon after breakfast Mary Ann brought in The Times. Mr. Carey shared it\r\nwith two neighbours. He had it from ten till one, when the gardener\r\ntook it over to Mr. Ellis at the Limes, with whom it remained till\r\nseven; then it was taken to Miss Brooks at the Manor House, who, since\r\nshe got it late, had the advantage of keeping it. In summer Mrs. Carey,\r\nwhen she was making jam, often asked her for a copy to cover the pots\r\nwith. When the Vicar settled down to his paper his wife put on her\r\nbonnet and went out to do the shopping. Philip accompanied her.\r\nBlackstable was a fishing village. It consisted of a high street in\r\nwhich were the shops, the bank, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the houses of\r\ntwo or three coalship owners; round the little harbor were shabby\r\nstreets in which lived fishermen and poor people; but since they went\r\nto chapel they were of no account. When Mrs. Carey passed the\r\ndissenting ministers in the street she stepped over to the other side\r\nto avoid meeting them, but if there was not time for this fixed her\r\neyes on the pavement. It was a scandal to which the Vicar had never\r\nresigned himself that there were three chapels in the High Street: he\r\ncould not help feeling that the law should have stepped in to prevent\r\ntheir erection. Shopping in Blackstable was not a simple matter; for\r\ndissent, helped by the fact that the parish church was two miles from\r\nthe town, was very common; and it was necessary to deal only with\r\nchurchgoers; Mrs. Carey knew perfectly that the vicarage custom might\r\nmake all the difference to a tradesman\xe2\x80\x99s faith. There were two butchers\r\nwho went to church, and they would not understand that the Vicar could\r\nnot deal with both of them at once; nor were they satisfied with his\r\nsimple plan of going for six months to one and for six months to the\r\nother. The butcher who was not sending meat to the vicarage constantly\r\nthreatened not to come to church, and the Vicar was sometimes obliged\r\nto make a threat: it was very wrong of him not to come to church, but\r\nif he carried iniquity further and actually went to chapel, then of\r\ncourse, excellent as his meat was, Mr. Carey would be forced to leave\r\nhim for ever. Mrs. Carey often stopped at the bank to deliver a message\r\nto Josiah Graves, the manager, who was choir-master, treasurer, and\r\nchurchwarden. He was a tall, thin man with a sallow face and a long\r\nnose; his hair was very white, and to Philip he seemed extremely old.\r\nHe kept the parish accounts, arranged the treats for the choir and the\r\nschools; though there was no organ in the parish church, it was\r\ngenerally considered (in Blackstable) that the choir he led was the\r\nbest in Kent; and when there was any ceremony, such as a visit from the\r\nBishop for confirmation or from the Rural Dean to preach at the Harvest\r\nThanksgiving, he made the necessary preparations. But he had no\r\nhesitation in doing all manner of things without more than a\r\nperfunctory consultation with the Vicar, and the Vicar, though always\r\nready to be saved trouble, much resented the churchwarden\xe2\x80\x99s managing\r\nways. He really seemed to look upon himself as the most important\r\nperson in the parish. Mr. Carey constantly told his wife that if Josiah\r\nGraves did not take care he would give him a good rap over the knuckles\r\none day; but Mrs. Carey advised him to bear with Josiah Graves: he\r\nmeant well, and it was not his fault if he was not quite a gentleman.\r\nThe Vicar, finding his comfort in the practice of a Christian virtue,\r\nexercised forbearance; but he revenged himself by calling the\r\nchurchwarden Bismarck behind his back.\r\n\r\nOnce there had been a serious quarrel between the pair, and Mrs. Carey\r\nstill thought of that anxious time with dismay. The Conservative\r\ncandidate had announced his intention of addressing a meeting at\r\nBlackstable; and Josiah Graves, having arranged that it should take\r\nplace in the Mission Hall, went to Mr. Carey and told him that he hoped\r\nhe would say a few words. It appeared that the candidate had asked\r\nJosiah Graves to take the chair. This was more than Mr. Carey could put\r\nup with. He had firm views upon the respect which was due to the cloth,\r\nand it was ridiculous for a churchwarden to take the chair at a meeting\r\nwhen the Vicar was there. He reminded Josiah Graves that parson meant\r\nperson, that is, the vicar was the person of the parish. Josiah Graves\r\nanswered that he was the first to recognise the dignity of the church,\r\nbut this was a matter of politics, and in his turn he reminded the\r\nVicar that their Blessed Saviour had enjoined upon them to render unto\r\nCaesar the things that were Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s. To this Mr. Carey replied that\r\nthe devil could quote scripture to his purpose, himself had sole\r\nauthority over the Mission Hall, and if he were not asked to be\r\nchairman he would refuse the use of it for a political meeting. Josiah\r\nGraves told Mr. Carey that he might do as he chose, and for his part he\r\nthought the Wesleyan Chapel would be an equally suitable place. Then\r\nMr. Carey said that if Josiah Graves set foot in what was little better\r\nthan a heathen temple he was not fit to be churchwarden in a Christian\r\nparish. Josiah Graves thereupon resigned all his offices, and that very\r\nevening sent to the church for his cassock and surplice. His sister,\r\nMiss Graves, who kept house for him, gave up her secretaryship of the\r\nMaternity Club, which provided the pregnant poor with flannel, baby\r\nlinen, coals, and five shillings. Mr. Carey said he was at last master\r\nin his own house. But soon he found that he was obliged to see to all\r\nsorts of things that he knew nothing about; and Josiah Graves, after\r\nthe first moment of irritation, discovered that he had lost his chief\r\ninterest in life. Mrs. Carey and Miss Graves were much distressed by\r\nthe quarrel; they met after a discreet exchange of letters, and made up\r\ntheir minds to put the matter right: they talked, one to her husband,\r\nthe other to her brother, from morning till night; and since they were\r\npersuading these gentlemen to do what in their hearts they wanted,\r\nafter three weeks of anxiety a reconciliation was effected. It was to\r\nboth their interests, but they ascribed it to a common love for their\r\nRedeemer. The meeting was held at the Mission Hall, and the doctor was\r\nasked to be chairman. Mr. Carey and Josiah Graves both made speeches.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Carey had finished her business with the banker, she\r\ngenerally went upstairs to have a little chat with his sister; and\r\nwhile the ladies talked of parish matters, the curate or the new bonnet\r\nof Mrs. Wilson\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Wilson was the richest man in Blackstable, he was\r\nthought to have at least five hundred a year, and he had married his\r\ncook\xe2\x80\x94Philip sat demurely in the stiff parlour, used only to receive\r\nvisitors, and busied himself with the restless movements of goldfish in\r\na bowl. The windows were never opened except to air the room for a few\r\nminutes in the morning, and it had a stuffy smell which seemed to\r\nPhilip to have a mysterious connection with banking.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Carey remembered that she had to go to the grocer, and they\r\ncontinued their way. When the shopping was done they often went down a\r\nside street of little houses, mostly of wood, in which fishermen dwelt\r\n(and here and there a fisherman sat on his doorstep mending his nets,\r\nand nets hung to dry upon the doors), till they came to a small beach,\r\nshut in on each side by warehouses, but with a view of the sea. Mrs.\r\nCarey stood for a few minutes and looked at it, it was turbid and\r\nyellow, [and who knows what thoughts passed through her mind?] while\r\nPhilip searched for flat stones to play ducks and drakes. Then they\r\nwalked slowly back. They looked into the post office to get the right\r\ntime, nodded to Mrs. Wigram the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who sat at her window\r\nsewing, and so got home.\r\n\r\nDinner was at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday it\r\nconsisted of beef, roast, hashed, and minced, and on Thursday, Friday,\r\nand Saturday of mutton. On Sunday they ate one of their own chickens.\r\nIn the afternoon Philip did his lessons, He was taught Latin and\r\nmathematics by his uncle who knew neither, and French and the piano by\r\nhis aunt. Of French she was ignorant, but she knew the piano well\r\nenough to accompany the old-fashioned songs she had sung for thirty\r\nyears. Uncle William used to tell Philip that when he was a curate his\r\nwife had known twelve songs by heart, which she could sing at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice whenever she was asked. She often sang still when there\r\nwas a tea-party at the vicarage. There were few people whom the Careys\r\ncared to ask there, and their parties consisted always of the curate,\r\nJosiah Graves with his sister, Dr. Wigram and his wife. After tea Miss\r\nGraves played one or two of Mendelssohn\xe2\x80\x99s Songs without Words, and Mrs.\r\nCarey sang When the Swallows Homeward Fly, or Trot, Trot, My Pony.\r\n\r\nBut the Careys did not give tea-parties often; the preparations upset\r\nthem, and when their guests were gone they felt themselves exhausted.\r\nThey preferred to have tea by themselves, and after tea they played\r\nbackgammon. Mrs. Carey arranged that her husband should win, because he\r\ndid not like losing. They had cold supper at eight. It was a scrappy\r\nmeal because Mary Ann resented getting anything ready after tea, and\r\nMrs. Carey helped to clear away. Mrs. Carey seldom ate more than bread\r\nand butter, with a little stewed fruit to follow, but the Vicar had a\r\nslice of cold meat. Immediately after supper Mrs. Carey rang the bell\r\nfor prayers, and then Philip went to bed. He rebelled against being\r\nundressed by Mary Ann and after a while succeeded in establishing his\r\nright to dress and undress himself. At nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock Mary Ann brought in\r\nthe eggs and the plate. Mrs. Carey wrote the date on each egg and put\r\nthe number down in a book. She then took the plate-basket on her arm\r\nand went upstairs. Mr. Carey continued to read one of his old books,\r\nbut as the clock struck ten he got up, put out the lamps, and followed\r\nhis wife to bed.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip arrived there was some difficulty in deciding on which\r\nevening he should have his bath. It was never easy to get plenty of hot\r\nwater, since the kitchen boiler did not work, and it was impossible for\r\ntwo persons to have a bath on the same day. The only man who had a\r\nbathroom in Blackstable was Mr. Wilson, and it was thought ostentatious\r\nof him. Mary Ann had her bath in the kitchen on Monday night, because\r\nshe liked to begin the week clean. Uncle William could not have his on\r\nSaturday, because he had a heavy day before him and he was always a\r\nlittle tired after a bath, so he had it on Friday. Mrs. Carey had hers\r\non Thursday for the same reason. It looked as though Saturday were\r\nnaturally indicated for Philip, but Mary Ann said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep the\r\nfire up on Saturday night: what with all the cooking on Sunday, having\r\nto make pastry and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what all, she did not feel up to\r\ngiving the boy his bath on Saturday night; and it was quite clear that\r\nhe could not bath himself. Mrs. Carey was shy about bathing a boy, and\r\nof course the Vicar had his sermon. But the Vicar insisted that Philip\r\nshould be clean and sweet for the lord\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Mary Ann said she would\r\nrather go than be put upon\xe2\x80\x94and after eighteen years she didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect\r\nto have more work given her, and they might show some consideration\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nPhilip said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to bath him, but could very well bath\r\nhimself. This settled it. Mary Ann said she was quite sure he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbath himself properly, and rather than he should go dirty\xe2\x80\x94and not\r\nbecause he was going into the presence of the Lord, but because she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide a boy who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t properly washed\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99d work herself to\r\nthe bone even if it was Saturday night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday was a day crowded with incident. Mr. Carey was accustomed to say\r\nthat he was the only man in his parish who worked seven days a week.\r\n\r\nThe household got up half an hour earlier than usual. No lying abed for\r\na poor parson on the day of rest, Mr. Carey remarked as Mary Ann\r\nknocked at the door punctually at eight. It took Mrs. Carey longer to\r\ndress, and she got down to breakfast at nine, a little breathless, only\r\njust before her husband. Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s boots stood in front of the fire\r\nto warm. Prayers were longer than usual, and the breakfast more\r\nsubstantial. After breakfast the Vicar cut thin slices of bread for the\r\ncommunion, and Philip was privileged to cut off the crust. He was sent\r\nto the study to fetch a marble paperweight, with which Mr. Carey\r\npressed the bread till it was thin and pulpy, and then it was cut into\r\nsmall squares. The amount was regulated by the weather. On a very bad\r\nday few people came to church, and on a very fine one, though many\r\ncame, few stayed for communion. There were most when it was dry enough\r\nto make the walk to church pleasant, but not so fine that people wanted\r\nto hurry away.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Carey brought the communion plate out of the safe, which\r\nstood in the pantry, and the Vicar polished it with a chamois leather.\r\nAt ten the fly drove up, and Mr. Carey got into his boots. Mrs. Carey\r\ntook several minutes to put on her bonnet, during which the Vicar, in a\r\nvoluminous cloak, stood in the hall with just such an expression on his\r\nface as would have become an early Christian about to be led into the\r\narena. It was extraordinary that after thirty years of marriage his\r\nwife could not be ready in time on Sunday morning. At last she came, in\r\nblack satin; the Vicar did not like colours in a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s wife at\r\nany time, but on Sundays he was determined that she should wear black;\r\nnow and then, in conspiracy with Miss Graves, she ventured a white\r\nfeather or a pink rose in her bonnet, but the Vicar insisted that it\r\nshould disappear; he said he would not go to church with the scarlet\r\nwoman: Mrs. Carey sighed as a woman but obeyed as a wife. They were\r\nabout to step into the carriage when the Vicar remembered that no one\r\nhad given him his egg. They knew that he must have an egg for his\r\nvoice, there were two women in the house, and no one had the least\r\nregard for his comfort. Mrs. Carey scolded Mary Ann, and Mary Ann\r\nanswered that she could not think of everything. She hurried away to\r\nfetch an egg, and Mrs. Carey beat it up in a glass of sherry. The Vicar\r\nswallowed it at a gulp. The communion plate was stowed in the carriage,\r\nand they set off.\r\n\r\nThe fly came from The Red Lion and had a peculiar smell of stale straw.\r\nThey drove with both windows closed so that the Vicar should not catch\r\ncold. The sexton was waiting at the porch to take the communion plate,\r\nand while the Vicar went to the vestry Mrs. Carey and Philip settled\r\nthemselves in the vicarage pew. Mrs. Carey placed in front of her the\r\nsixpenny bit she was accustomed to put in the plate, and gave Philip\r\nthreepence for the same purpose. The church filled up gradually and the\r\nservice began.\r\n\r\nPhilip grew bored during the sermon, but if he fidgetted Mrs. Carey put\r\na gentle hand on his arm and looked at him reproachfully. He regained\r\ninterest when the final hymn was sung and Mr. Graves passed round with\r\nthe plate.\r\n\r\nWhen everyone had gone Mrs. Carey went into Miss Graves\xe2\x80\x99 pew to have a\r\nfew words with her while they were waiting for the gentlemen, and\r\nPhilip went to the vestry. His uncle, the curate, and Mr. Graves were\r\nstill in their surplices. Mr. Carey gave him the remains of the\r\nconsecrated bread and told him he might eat it. He had been accustomed\r\nto eat it himself, as it seemed blasphemous to throw it away, but\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s keen appetite relieved him from the duty. Then they counted\r\nthe money. It consisted of pennies, sixpences and threepenny bits.\r\nThere were always two single shillings, one put in the plate by the\r\nVicar and the other by Mr. Graves; and sometimes there was a florin.\r\nMr. Graves told the Vicar who had given this. It was always a stranger\r\nto Blackstable, and Mr. Carey wondered who he was. But Miss Graves had\r\nobserved the rash act and was able to tell Mrs. Carey that the stranger\r\ncame from London, was married and had children. During the drive home\r\nMrs. Carey passed the information on, and the Vicar made up his mind to\r\ncall on him and ask for a subscription to the Additional Curates\r\nSociety. Mr. Carey asked if Philip had behaved properly; and Mrs. Carey\r\nremarked that Mrs. Wigram had a new mantle, Mr. Cox was not in church,\r\nand somebody thought that Miss Phillips was engaged. When they reached\r\nthe vicarage they all felt that they deserved a substantial dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen this was over Mrs. Carey went to her room to rest, and Mr. Carey\r\nlay down on the sofa in the drawing-room for forty winks.\r\n\r\nThey had tea at five, and the Vicar ate an egg to support himself for\r\nevensong. Mrs. Carey did not go to this so that Mary Ann might, but she\r\nread the service through and the hymns. Mr. Carey walked to church in\r\nthe evening, and Philip limped along by his side. The walk through the\r\ndarkness along the country road strangely impressed him, and the church\r\nwith all its lights in the distance, coming gradually nearer, seemed\r\nvery friendly. At first he was shy with his uncle, but little by little\r\ngrew used to him, and he would slip his hand in his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s and walk\r\nmore easily for the feeling of protection.\r\n\r\nThey had supper when they got home. Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s slippers were waiting\r\nfor him on a footstool in front of the fire and by their side Philip\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\none the shoe of a small boy, the other misshapen and odd. He was\r\ndreadfully tired when he went up to bed, and he did not resist when\r\nMary Ann undressed him. She kissed him after she tucked him up, and he\r\nbegan to love her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip had led always the solitary life of an only child, and his\r\nloneliness at the vicarage was no greater than it had been when his\r\nmother lived. He made friends with Mary Ann. She was a chubby little\r\nperson of thirty-five, the daughter of a fisherman, and had come to the\r\nvicarage at eighteen; it was her first place and she had no intention\r\nof leaving it; but she held a possible marriage as a rod over the timid\r\nheads of her master and mistress. Her father and mother lived in a\r\nlittle house off Harbour Street, and she went to see them on her\r\nevenings out. Her stories of the sea touched Philip\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, and\r\nthe narrow alleys round the harbour grew rich with the romance which\r\nhis young fancy lent them. One evening he asked whether he might go\r\nhome with her; but his aunt was afraid that he might catch something,\r\nand his uncle said that evil communications corrupted good manners. He\r\ndisliked the fisher folk, who were rough, uncouth, and went to chapel.\r\nBut Philip was more comfortable in the kitchen than in the dining-room,\r\nand, whenever he could, he took his toys and played there. His aunt was\r\nnot sorry. She did not like disorder, and though she recognised that\r\nboys must be expected to be untidy she preferred that he should make a\r\nmess in the kitchen. If he fidgeted his uncle was apt to grow restless\r\nand say it was high time he went to school. Mrs. Carey thought Philip\r\nvery young for this, and her heart went out to the motherless child;\r\nbut her attempts to gain his affection were awkward, and the boy,\r\nfeeling shy, received her demonstrations with so much sullenness that\r\nshe was mortified. Sometimes she heard his shrill voice raised in\r\nlaughter in the kitchen, but when she went in, he grew suddenly silent,\r\nand he flushed darkly when Mary Ann explained the joke. Mrs. Carey\r\ncould not see anything amusing in what she heard, and she smiled with\r\nconstraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems happier with Mary Ann than with us, William,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when\r\nshe returned to her sewing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can see he\xe2\x80\x99s been very badly brought up. He wants licking into\r\nshape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the second Sunday after Philip arrived an unlucky incident occurred.\r\nMr. Carey had retired as usual after dinner for a little snooze in the\r\ndrawing-room, but he was in an irritable mood and could not sleep.\r\nJosiah Graves that morning had objected strongly to some candlesticks\r\nwith which the Vicar had adorned the altar. He had bought them\r\nsecond-hand in Tercanbury, and he thought they looked very well. But\r\nJosiah Graves said they were popish. This was a taunt that always\r\naroused the Vicar. He had been at Oxford during the movement which\r\nended in the secession from the Established Church of Edward Manning,\r\nand he felt a certain sympathy for the Church of Rome. He would\r\nwillingly have made the service more ornate than had been usual in the\r\nlow-church parish of Blackstable, and in his secret soul he yearned for\r\nprocessions and lighted candles. He drew the line at incense. He hated\r\nthe word protestant. He called himself a Catholic. He was accustomed to\r\nsay that Papists required an epithet, they were Roman Catholic; but the\r\nChurch of England was Catholic in the best, the fullest, and the\r\nnoblest sense of the term. He was pleased to think that his shaven face\r\ngave him the look of a priest, and in his youth he had possessed an\r\nascetic air which added to the impression. He often related that on one\r\nof his holidays in Boulogne, one of those holidays upon which his wife\r\nfor economy\xe2\x80\x99s sake did not accompany him, when he was sitting in a\r\nchurch, the cure had come up to him and invited him to preach a sermon.\r\nHe dismissed his curates when they married, having decided views on the\r\ncelibacy of the unbeneficed clergy. But when at an election the\r\nLiberals had written on his garden fence in large blue letters: This\r\nway to Rome, he had been very angry, and threatened to prosecute the\r\nleaders of the Liberal party in Blackstable. He made up his mind now\r\nthat nothing Josiah Graves said would induce him to remove the\r\ncandlesticks from the altar, and he muttered Bismarck to himself once\r\nor twice irritably.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard an unexpected noise. He pulled the handkerchief off\r\nhis face, got up from the sofa on which he was lying, and went into the\r\ndining-room. Philip was seated on the table with all his bricks around\r\nhim. He had built a monstrous castle, and some defect in the foundation\r\nhad just brought the structure down in noisy ruin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing with those bricks, Philip? You know you\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nallowed to play games on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip stared at him for a moment with frightened eyes, and, as his\r\nhabit was, flushed deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always used to play at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure your dear mamma never allowed you to do such a wicked thing\r\nas that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not know it was wicked; but if it was, he did not wish it to\r\nbe supposed that his mother had consented to it. He hung his head and\r\ndid not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know it\xe2\x80\x99s very, very wicked to play on Sunday? What d\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s called the day of rest for? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to church\r\ntonight, and how can you face your Maker when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been breaking one\r\nof His laws in the afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey told him to put the bricks away at once, and stood over him\r\nwhile Philip did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a very naughty boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of the grief you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncausing your poor mother in heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt inclined to cry, but he had an instinctive disinclination\r\nto letting other people see his tears, and he clenched his teeth to\r\nprevent the sobs from escaping. Mr. Carey sat down in his arm-chair and\r\nbegan to turn over the pages of a book. Philip stood at the window. The\r\nvicarage was set back from the highroad to Tercanbury, and from the\r\ndining-room one saw a semicircular strip of lawn and then as far as the\r\nhorizon green fields. Sheep were grazing in them. The sky was forlorn\r\nand gray. Philip felt infinitely unhappy.\r\n\r\nPresently Mary Ann came in to lay the tea, and Aunt Louisa descended\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had a nice little nap, William?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip made so much noise that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep a\r\nwink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not quite accurate, for he had been kept awake by his own\r\nthoughts; and Philip, listening sullenly, reflected that he had only\r\nmade a noise once, and there was no reason why his uncle should not\r\nhave slept before or after. When Mrs. Carey asked for an explanation\r\nthe Vicar narrated the facts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even said he was sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Philip, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Carey, anxious that the\r\nchild should not seem wickeder to his uncle than need be.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not reply. He went on munching his bread and butter. He did\r\nnot know what power it was in him that prevented him from making any\r\nexpression of regret. He felt his ears tingling, he was a little\r\ninclined to cry, but no word would issue from his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t make it worse by sulking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\nTea was finished in silence. Mrs. Carey looked at Philip\r\nsurreptitiously now and then, but the Vicar elaborately ignored him.\r\nWhen Philip saw his uncle go upstairs to get ready for church he went\r\ninto the hall and got his hat and coat, but when the Vicar came\r\ndownstairs and saw him, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish you to go to church tonight, Philip. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nin a proper frame of mind to enter the House of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not say a word. He felt it was a deep humiliation that was\r\nplaced upon him, and his cheeks reddened. He stood silently watching\r\nhis uncle put on his broad hat and his voluminous cloak. Mrs. Carey as\r\nusual went to the door to see him off. Then she turned to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Philip, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be a naughty boy next Sunday, will you,\r\nand then your uncle will take you to church with him in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took off his hat and coat, and led him into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you and I read the service together, Philip, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll sing the\r\nhymns at the harmonium. Would you like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip shook his head decidedly. Mrs. Carey was taken aback. If he\r\nwould not read the evening service with her she did not know what to do\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what would you like to do until your uncle comes back?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nhelplessly.\r\n\r\nPhilip broke his silence at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be left alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, how can you say anything so unkind? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that your\r\nuncle and I only want your good? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you love me at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate you. I wish you was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey gasped. He said the words so savagely that it gave her quite\r\na start. She had nothing to say. She sat down in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s chair;\r\nand as she thought of her desire to love the friendless, crippled boy\r\nand her eager wish that he should love her\xe2\x80\x94she was a barren woman and,\r\neven though it was clearly God\xe2\x80\x99s will that she should be childless, she\r\ncould scarcely bear to look at little children sometimes, her heart\r\nached so\xe2\x80\x94the tears rose to her eyes and one by one, slowly, rolled down\r\nher cheeks. Philip watched her in amazement. She took out her\r\nhandkerchief, and now she cried without restraint. Suddenly Philip\r\nrealised that she was crying because of what he had said, and he was\r\nsorry. He went up to her silently and kissed her. It was the first kiss\r\nhe had ever given her without being asked. And the poor lady, so small\r\nin her black satin, shrivelled up and sallow, with her funny corkscrew\r\ncurls, took the little boy on her lap and put her arms around him and\r\nwept as though her heart would break. But her tears were partly tears\r\nof happiness, for she felt that the strangeness between them was gone.\r\nShe loved him now with a new love because he had made her suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday, when the Vicar was making his preparations to\r\ngo into the drawing-room for his nap\xe2\x80\x94all the actions of his life were\r\nconducted with ceremony\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs. Carey was about to go upstairs, Philip\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do if I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to play?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you sit still for once and be quiet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sit still till tea-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey looked out of the window, but it was cold and raw, and he\r\ncould not suggest that Philip should go into the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you can do. You can learn by heart the collect for the\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the prayer-book which was used for prayers from the harmonium,\r\nand turned the pages till he came to the place he wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a long one. If you can say it without a mistake when I come\r\nin to tea you shall have the top of my egg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey drew up Philip\xe2\x80\x99s chair to the dining-room table\xe2\x80\x94they had\r\nbought him a high chair by now\xe2\x80\x94and placed the book in front of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil finds work for idle hands to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\nHe put some more coals on the fire so that there should be a cheerful\r\nblaze when he came in to tea, and went into the drawing-room. He\r\nloosened his collar, arranged the cushions, and settled himself\r\ncomfortably on the sofa. But thinking the drawing-room a little chilly,\r\nMrs. Carey brought him a rug from the hall; she put it over his legs\r\nand tucked it round his feet. She drew the blinds so that the light\r\nshould not offend his eyes, and since he had closed them already went\r\nout of the room on tiptoe. The Vicar was at peace with himself today,\r\nand in ten minutes he was asleep. He snored softly.\r\n\r\nIt was the Sixth Sunday after Epiphany, and the collect began with the\r\nwords: O God, whose blessed Son was manifested that he might destroy\r\nthe works of the devil, and make us the sons of God, and heirs of\r\nEternal life. Philip read it through. He could make no sense of it. He\r\nbegan saying the words aloud to himself, but many of them were unknown\r\nto him, and the construction of the sentence was strange. He could not\r\nget more than two lines in his head. And his attention was constantly\r\nwandering: there were fruit trees trained on the walls of the vicarage,\r\nand a long twig beat now and then against the windowpane; sheep grazed\r\nstolidly in the field beyond the garden. It seemed as though there were\r\nknots inside his brain. Then panic seized him that he would not know\r\nthe words by tea-time, and he kept on whispering them to himself\r\nquickly; he did not try to understand, but merely to get them\r\nparrot-like into his memory.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey could not sleep that afternoon, and by four o\xe2\x80\x99clock she was\r\nso wide awake that she came downstairs. She thought she would hear\r\nPhilip his collect so that he should make no mistakes when he said it\r\nto his uncle. His uncle then would be pleased; he would see that the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s heart was in the right place. But when Mrs. Carey came to the\r\ndining-room and was about to go in, she heard a sound that made her\r\nstop suddenly. Her heart gave a little jump. She turned away and\r\nquietly slipped out of the front-door. She walked round the house till\r\nshe came to the dining-room window and then cautiously looked in.\r\nPhilip was still sitting on the chair she had put him in, but his head\r\nwas on the table buried in his arms, and he was sobbing desperately.\r\nShe saw the convulsive movement of his shoulders. Mrs. Carey was\r\nfrightened. A thing that had always struck her about the child was that\r\nhe seemed so collected. She had never seen him cry. And now she\r\nrealised that his calmness was some instinctive shame of showing his\r\nfeelings: he hid himself to weep.\r\n\r\nWithout thinking that her husband disliked being wakened suddenly, she\r\nburst into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam, William,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s crying as though his heart\r\nwould break.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey sat up and disentangled himself from the rug about his legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he got to cry about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\xa6. Oh, William, we can\xe2\x80\x99t let the boy be unhappy. D\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s our fault? If we\xe2\x80\x99d had children we\xe2\x80\x99d have known what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey looked at her in perplexity. He felt extraordinarily\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t be crying because I gave him the collect to learn. It\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nmore than ten lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think I might take him some picture books to look at,\r\nWilliam? There are some of the Holy Land. There couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be anything\r\nwrong in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey went into the study. To collect books was Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\npassion, and he never went into Tercanbury without spending an hour or\r\ntwo in the second-hand shop; he always brought back four or five musty\r\nvolumes. He never read them, for he had long lost the habit of reading,\r\nbut he liked to turn the pages, look at the illustrations if they were\r\nillustrated, and mend the bindings. He welcomed wet days because on\r\nthem he could stay at home without pangs of conscience and spend the\r\nafternoon with white of egg and a glue-pot, patching up the Russia\r\nleather of some battered quarto. He had many volumes of old travels,\r\nwith steel engravings, and Mrs. Carey quickly found two which described\r\nPalestine. She coughed elaborately at the door so that Philip should\r\nhave time to compose himself, she felt that he would be humiliated if\r\nshe came upon him in the midst of his tears, then she rattled the door\r\nhandle. When she went in Philip was poring over the prayer-book, hiding\r\nhis eyes with his hands so that she might not see he had been crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the collect yet?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer for a moment, and she felt that he did not trust his\r\nvoice. She was oddly embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t learn it by heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, with a gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some picture\r\nbooks for you to look at. Come and sit on my lap, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at\r\nthem together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip slipped off his chair and limped over to her. He looked down so\r\nthat she should not see his eyes. She put her arms round him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the place where our blessed Lord was born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed him an Eastern town with flat roofs and cupolas and\r\nminarets. In the foreground was a group of palm-trees, and under them\r\nwere resting two Arabs and some camels. Philip passed his hand over the\r\npicture as if he wanted to feel the houses and the loose habiliments of\r\nthe nomads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead what it says,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey in her even voice read the opposite page. It was a romantic\r\nnarrative of some Eastern traveller of the thirties, pompous maybe, but\r\nfragrant with the emotion with which the East came to the generation\r\nthat followed Byron and Chateaubriand. In a moment or two Philip\r\ninterrupted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to see another picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mary Ann came in and Mrs. Carey rose to help her lay the cloth.\r\nPhilip took the book in his hands and hurried through the\r\nillustrations. It was with difficulty that his aunt induced him to put\r\nthe book down for tea. He had forgotten his horrible struggle to get\r\nthe collect by heart; he had forgotten his tears. Next day it was\r\nraining, and he asked for the book again. Mrs. Carey gave it him\r\njoyfully. Talking over his future with her husband she had found that\r\nboth desired him to take orders, and this eagerness for the book which\r\ndescribed places hallowed by the presence of Jesus seemed a good sign.\r\nIt looked as though the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mind addressed itself naturally to holy\r\nthings. But in a day or two he asked for more books. Mr. Carey took him\r\ninto his study, showed him the shelf in which he kept illustrated\r\nworks, and chose for him one that dealt with Rome. Philip took it\r\ngreedily. The pictures led him to a new amusement. He began to read the\r\npage before and the page after each engraving to find out what it was\r\nabout, and soon he lost all interest in his toys.\r\n\r\nThen, when no one was near, he took out books for himself; and perhaps\r\nbecause the first impression on his mind was made by an Eastern town,\r\nhe found his chief amusement in those which described the Levant. His\r\nheart beat with excitement at the pictures of mosques and rich palaces;\r\nbut there was one, in a book on Constantinople, which peculiarly\r\nstirred his imagination. It was called the Hall of the Thousand\r\nColumns. It was a Byzantine cistern, which the popular fancy had\r\nendowed with fantastic vastness; and the legend which he read told that\r\na boat was always moored at the entrance to tempt the unwary, but no\r\ntraveller venturing into the darkness had ever been seen again. And\r\nPhilip wondered whether the boat went on for ever through one pillared\r\nalley after another or came at last to some strange mansion.\r\n\r\nOne day a good fortune befell him, for he hit upon Lane\xe2\x80\x99s translation\r\nof The Thousand Nights and a Night. He was captured first by the\r\nillustrations, and then he began to read, to start with, the stories\r\nthat dealt with magic, and then the others; and those he liked he read\r\nagain and again. He could think of nothing else. He forgot the life\r\nabout him. He had to be called two or three times before he would come\r\nto his dinner. Insensibly he formed the most delightful habit in the\r\nworld, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus he was providing\r\nhimself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did not know\r\neither that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would\r\nmake the real world of every day a source of bitter disappointment.\r\nPresently he began to read other things. His brain was precocious. His\r\nuncle and aunt, seeing that he occupied himself and neither worried nor\r\nmade a noise, ceased to trouble themselves about him. Mr. Carey had so\r\nmany books that he did not know them, and as he read little he forgot\r\nthe odd lots he had bought at one time and another because they were\r\ncheap. Haphazard among the sermons and homilies, the travels, the lives\r\nof the Saints, the Fathers, the histories of the church, were\r\nold-fashioned novels; and these Philip at last discovered. He chose\r\nthem by their titles, and the first he read was The Lancashire Witches,\r\nand then he read The Admirable Crichton, and then many more. Whenever\r\nhe started a book with two solitary travellers riding along the brink\r\nof a desperate ravine he knew he was safe.\r\n\r\nThe summer was come now, and the gardener, an old sailor, made him a\r\nhammock and fixed it up for him in the branches of a weeping willow.\r\nAnd here for long hours he lay, hidden from anyone who might come to\r\nthe vicarage, reading, reading passionately. Time passed and it was\r\nJuly; August came: on Sundays the church was crowded with strangers,\r\nand the collection at the offertory often amounted to two pounds.\r\nNeither the Vicar nor Mrs. Carey went out of the garden much during\r\nthis period; for they disliked strange faces, and they looked upon the\r\nvisitors from London with aversion. The house opposite was taken for\r\nsix weeks by a gentleman who had two little boys, and he sent in to ask\r\nif Philip would like to go and play with them; but Mrs. Carey returned\r\na polite refusal. She was afraid that Philip would be corrupted by\r\nlittle boys from London. He was going to be a clergyman, and it was\r\nnecessary that he should be preserved from contamination. She liked to\r\nsee in him an infant Samuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Careys made up their minds to send Philip to King\xe2\x80\x99s School at\r\nTercanbury. The neighbouring clergy sent their sons there. It was\r\nunited by long tradition to the Cathedral: its headmaster was an\r\nhonorary Canon, and a past headmaster was the Archdeacon. Boys were\r\nencouraged there to aspire to Holy Orders, and the education was such\r\nas might prepare an honest lad to spend his life in God\xe2\x80\x99s service. A\r\npreparatory school was attached to it, and to this it was arranged that\r\nPhilip should go. Mr. Carey took him into Tercanbury one Thursday\r\nafternoon towards the end of September. All day Philip had been excited\r\nand rather frightened. He knew little of school life but what he had\r\nread in the stories of The Boy\xe2\x80\x99s Own Paper. He had also read Eric, or\r\nLittle by Little.\r\n\r\nWhen they got out of the train at Tercanbury, Philip felt sick with\r\napprehension, and during the drive in to the town sat pale and silent.\r\nThe high brick wall in front of the school gave it the look of a\r\nprison. There was a little door in it, which opened on their ringing;\r\nand a clumsy, untidy man came out and fetched Philip\xe2\x80\x99s tin trunk and\r\nhis play-box. They were shown into the drawing-room; it was filled with\r\nmassive, ugly furniture, and the chairs of the suite were placed round\r\nthe walls with a forbidding rigidity. They waited for the headmaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Watson like?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, after a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Mr. Carey wondered why the headmaster did not\r\ncome. Presently Philip made an effort and spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a club-foot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Carey could speak the door burst open and Mr. Watson swept\r\ninto the room. To Philip he seemed gigantic. He was a man of over six\r\nfeet high, and broad, with enormous hands and a great red beard; he\r\ntalked loudly in a jovial manner; but his aggressive cheerfulness\r\nstruck terror in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart. He shook hands with Mr. Carey, and\r\nthen took Philip\xe2\x80\x99s small hand in his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened and found no word to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must say sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said his uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good lot to learn,\xe2\x80\x9d the headmaster bellowed\r\ncheerily.\r\n\r\nTo give the boy confidence he began to tickle him with rough fingers.\r\nPhilip, feeling shy and uncomfortable, squirmed under his touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve put him in the small dormitory for the present\xe2\x80\xa6. You\xe2\x80\x99ll like\r\nthat, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly eight of you in there. You\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t feel so strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the door opened, and Mrs. Watson came in. She was a dark woman\r\nwith black hair, neatly parted in the middle. She had curiously thick\r\nlips and a small round nose. Her eyes were large and black. There was a\r\nsingular coldness in her appearance. She seldom spoke and smiled more\r\nseldom still. Her husband introduced Mr. Carey to her, and then gave\r\nPhilip a friendly push towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a new boy, Helen, His name\xe2\x80\x99s Carey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word she shook hands with Philip and then sat down, not\r\nspeaking, while the headmaster asked Mr. Carey how much Philip knew and\r\nwhat books he had been working with. The Vicar of Blackstable was a\r\nlittle embarrassed by Mr. Watson\xe2\x80\x99s boisterous heartiness, and in a\r\nmoment or two got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d better leave Philip with you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Watson. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be safe with me. He\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\non like a house on fire. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you, young fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer from Philip the big man burst into a\r\ngreat bellow of laughter. Mr. Carey kissed Philip on the forehead and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, young fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mr. Watson. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the\r\nschool-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe swept out of the drawing-room with giant strides, and Philip\r\nhurriedly limped behind him. He was taken into a long, bare room with\r\ntwo tables that ran along its whole length; on each side of them were\r\nwooden forms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody much here yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Watson. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just show you the\r\nplayground, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you to shift for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Watson led the way. Philip found himself in a large play-ground\r\nwith high brick walls on three sides of it. On the fourth side was an\r\niron railing through which you saw a vast lawn and beyond this some of\r\nthe buildings of King\xe2\x80\x99s School. One small boy was wandering\r\ndisconsolately, kicking up the gravel as he walked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa, Venning,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mr. Watson. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you turn up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe small boy came forward and shook hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a new boy. He\xe2\x80\x99s older and bigger than you, so don\xe2\x80\x99t you bully\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe headmaster glared amicably at the two children, filling them with\r\nfear by the roar of his voice, and then with a guffaw left them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Does your mother wash?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s dead, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thought this answer would cause the boy a certain awkwardness,\r\nbut Venning was not to be turned from his facetiousness for so little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, did she wash?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a washerwoman then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she didn\xe2\x80\x99t wash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little boy crowed with delight at the success of his dialectic.\r\nThen he caught sight of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with your foot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip instinctively tried to withdraw it from sight. He hid it behind\r\nthe one which was whole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a club-foot,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always had it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little boy accompanied the words with a sharp kick on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshin, which Philip did not expect and thus could not guard against. The\r\npain was so great that it made him gasp, but greater than the pain was\r\nthe surprise. He did not know why Venning kicked him. He had not the\r\npresence of mind to give him a black eye. Besides, the boy was smaller\r\nthan he, and he had read in The Boy\xe2\x80\x99s Own Paper that it was a mean\r\nthing to hit anyone smaller than yourself. While Philip was nursing his\r\nshin a third boy appeared, and his tormentor left him. In a little\r\nwhile he noticed that the pair were talking about him, and he felt they\r\nwere looking at his feet. He grew hot and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nBut others arrived, a dozen together, and then more, and they began to\r\ntalk about their doings during the holidays, where they had been, and\r\nwhat wonderful cricket they had played. A few new boys appeared, and\r\nwith these presently Philip found himself talking. He was shy and\r\nnervous. He was anxious to make himself pleasant, but he could not\r\nthink of anything to say. He was asked a great many questions and\r\nanswered them all quite willingly. One boy asked him whether he could\r\nplay cricket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a club-foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy looked down quickly and reddened. Philip saw that he felt he\r\nhad asked an unseemly question. He was too shy to apologise and looked\r\nat Philip awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning when the clanging of a bell awoke Philip he looked round\r\nhis cubicle in astonishment. Then a voice sang out, and he remembered\r\nwhere he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you awake, Singer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe partitions of the cubicle were of polished pitch-pine, and there\r\nwas a green curtain in front. In those days there was little thought of\r\nventilation, and the windows were closed except when the dormitory was\r\naired in the morning.\r\n\r\nPhilip got up and knelt down to say his prayers. It was a cold morning,\r\nand he shivered a little; but he had been taught by his uncle that his\r\nprayers were more acceptable to God if he said them in his nightshirt\r\nthan if he waited till he was dressed. This did not surprise him, for\r\nhe was beginning to realise that he was the creature of a God who\r\nappreciated the discomfort of his worshippers. Then he washed. There\r\nwere two baths for the fifty boarders, and each boy had a bath once a\r\nweek. The rest of his washing was done in a small basin on a\r\nwash-stand, which with the bed and a chair, made up the furniture of\r\neach cubicle. The boys chatted gaily while they dressed. Philip was all\r\nears. Then another bell sounded, and they ran downstairs. They took\r\ntheir seats on the forms on each side of the two long tables in the\r\nschool-room; and Mr. Watson, followed by his wife and the servants,\r\ncame in and sat down. Mr. Watson read prayers in an impressive manner,\r\nand the supplications thundered out in his loud voice as though they\r\nwere threats personally addressed to each boy. Philip listened with\r\nanxiety. Then Mr. Watson read a chapter from the Bible, and the\r\nservants trooped out. In a moment the untidy youth brought in two large\r\npots of tea and on a second journey immense dishes of bread and butter.\r\n\r\nPhilip had a squeamish appetite, and the thick slabs of poor butter on\r\nthe bread turned his stomach, but he saw other boys scraping it off and\r\nfollowed their example. They all had potted meats and such like, which\r\nthey had brought in their play-boxes; and some had \xe2\x80\x98extras,\xe2\x80\x99 eggs or\r\nbacon, upon which Mr. Watson made a profit. When he had asked Mr. Carey\r\nwhether Philip was to have these, Mr. Carey replied that he did not\r\nthink boys should be spoilt. Mr. Watson quite agreed with him\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nconsidered nothing was better than bread and butter for growing\r\nlads\xe2\x80\x94but some parents, unduly pampering their offspring, insisted on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPhilip noticed that \xe2\x80\x98extras\xe2\x80\x99 gave boys a certain consideration and made\r\nup his mind, when he wrote to Aunt Louisa, to ask for them.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the boys wandered out into the play-ground. Here the\r\nday-boys were gradually assembling. They were sons of the local clergy,\r\nof the officers at the Depot, and of such manufacturers or men of\r\nbusiness as the old town possessed. Presently a bell rang, and they all\r\ntrooped into school. This consisted of a large, long room at opposite\r\nends of which two under-masters conducted the second and third forms,\r\nand of a smaller one, leading out of it, used by Mr. Watson, who taught\r\nthe first form. To attach the preparatory to the senior school these\r\nthree classes were known officially, on speech days and in reports, as\r\nupper, middle, and lower second. Philip was put in the last. The\r\nmaster, a red-faced man with a pleasant voice, was called Rice; he had\r\na jolly manner with boys, and the time passed quickly. Philip was\r\nsurprised when it was a quarter to eleven and they were let out for ten\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 rest.\r\n\r\nThe whole school rushed noisily into the play-ground. The new boys were\r\ntold to go into the middle, while the others stationed themselves along\r\nopposite walls. They began to play Pig in the Middle. The old boys ran\r\nfrom wall to wall while the new boys tried to catch them: when one was\r\nseized and the mystic words said\xe2\x80\x94one, two, three, and a pig for me\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nbecame a prisoner and, turning sides, helped to catch those who were\r\nstill free. Philip saw a boy running past and tried to catch him, but\r\nhis limp gave him no chance; and the runners, taking their opportunity,\r\nmade straight for the ground he covered. Then one of them had the\r\nbrilliant idea of imitating Philip\xe2\x80\x99s clumsy run. Other boys saw it and\r\nbegan to laugh; then they all copied the first; and they ran round\r\nPhilip, limping grotesquely, screaming in their treble voices with\r\nshrill laughter. They lost their heads with the delight of their new\r\namusement, and choked with helpless merriment. One of them tripped\r\nPhilip up and he fell, heavily as he always fell, and cut his knee.\r\nThey laughed all the louder when he got up. A boy pushed him from\r\nbehind, and he would have fallen again if another had not caught him.\r\nThe game was forgotten in the entertainment of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s deformity. One\r\nof them invented an odd, rolling limp that struck the rest as supremely\r\nridiculous, and several of the boys lay down on the ground and rolled\r\nabout in laughter: Philip was completely scared. He could not make out\r\nwhy they were laughing at him. His heart beat so that he could hardly\r\nbreathe, and he was more frightened than he had ever been in his life.\r\nHe stood still stupidly while the boys ran round him, mimicking and\r\nlaughing; they shouted to him to try and catch them; but he did not\r\nmove. He did not want them to see him run any more. He was using all\r\nhis strength to prevent himself from crying.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the bell rang, and they all trooped back to school. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknee was bleeding, and he was dusty and dishevelled. For some minutes\r\nMr. Rice could not control his form. They were excited still by the\r\nstrange novelty, and Philip saw one or two of them furtively looking\r\ndown at his feet. He tucked them under the bench.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon they went up to play football, but Mr. Watson stopped\r\nPhilip on the way out after dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you can\xe2\x80\x99t play football, Carey?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked him.\r\n\r\nPhilip blushed self-consciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. You\xe2\x80\x99d better go up to the field. You can walk as far as\r\nthat, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had no idea where the field was, but he answered all the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys went in charge of Mr. Rice, who glanced at Philip and seeing\r\nhe had not changed, asked why he was not going to play.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Watson said I needn\xe2\x80\x99t, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were boys all round him, looking at him curiously, and a feeling\r\nof shame came over Philip. He looked down without answering. Others\r\ngave the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got a club-foot, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Rice was quite young; he had only taken his degree a year before;\r\nand he was suddenly embarrassed. His instinct was to beg the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npardon, but he was too shy to do so. He made his voice gruff and loud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, you boys, what are you waiting about for? Get on with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of them had already started and those that were left now set off,\r\nin groups of two or three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better come along with me, Carey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow the way, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip guessed the kindness, and a sob came to his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go very fast, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll go very slow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master, with a smile.\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart went out to the red-faced, commonplace young man who\r\nsaid a gentle word to him. He suddenly felt less unhappy.\r\n\r\nBut at night when they went up to bed and were undressing, the boy who\r\nwas called Singer came out of his cubicle and put his head in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at your foot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\nHe jumped into bed quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say no to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Singer. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Mason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy in the next cubicle was looking round the corner, and at the\r\nwords he slipped in. They made for Philip and tried to tear the\r\nbed-clothes off him, but he held them tightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you leave me alone?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nSinger seized a brush and with the back of it beat Philip\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\nclenched on the blanket. Philip cried out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you show us your foot quietly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn desperation Philip clenched his fist and hit the boy who tormented\r\nhim, but he was at a disadvantage, and the boy seized his arm. He began\r\nto turn it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll break my arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop still then and put out your foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip gave a sob and a gasp. The boy gave the arm another wrench. The\r\npain was unendurable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe put out his foot. Singer still kept his hand on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s wrist. He\r\nlooked curiously at the deformity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it beastly?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mason.\r\n\r\nAnother came in and looked too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word, it is rum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Singer, making a face. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it hard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe touched it with the tip of his forefinger, cautiously, as though it\r\nwere something that had a life of its own. Suddenly they heard Mr.\r\nWatson\xe2\x80\x99s heavy tread on the stairs. They threw the clothes back on\r\nPhilip and dashed like rabbits into their cubicles. Mr. Watson came\r\ninto the dormitory. Raising himself on tiptoe he could see over the rod\r\nthat bore the green curtain, and he looked into two or three of the\r\ncubicles. The little boys were safely in bed. He put out the light and\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\nSinger called out to Philip, but he did not answer. He had got his\r\nteeth in the pillow so that his sobbing should be inaudible. He was not\r\ncrying for the pain they had caused him, nor for the humiliation he had\r\nsuffered when they looked at his foot, but with rage at himself\r\nbecause, unable to stand the torture, he had put out his foot of his\r\nown accord.\r\n\r\nAnd then he felt the misery of his life. It seemed to his childish mind\r\nthat this unhappiness must go on for ever. For no particular reason he\r\nremembered that cold morning when Emma had taken him out of bed and put\r\nhim beside his mother. He had not thought of it once since it happened,\r\nbut now he seemed to feel the warmth of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s body against his\r\nand her arms around him. Suddenly it seemed to him that his life was a\r\ndream, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, and the life at the vicarage, and these two\r\nwretched days at school, and he would awake in the morning and be back\r\nagain at home. His tears dried as he thought of it. He was too unhappy,\r\nit must be nothing but a dream, and his mother was alive, and Emma\r\nwould come up presently and go to bed. He fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBut when he awoke next morning it was to the clanging of a bell, and\r\nthe first thing his eyes saw was the green curtain of his cubicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs time went on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s deformity ceased to interest. It was accepted\r\nlike one boy\xe2\x80\x99s red hair and another\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonable corpulence. But\r\nmeanwhile he had grown horribly sensitive. He never ran if he could\r\nhelp it, because he knew it made his limp more conspicuous, and he\r\nadopted a peculiar walk. He stood still as much as he could, with his\r\nclub-foot behind the other, so that it should not attract notice, and\r\nhe was constantly on the look out for any reference to it. Because he\r\ncould not join in the games which other boys played, their life\r\nremained strange to him; he only interested himself from the outside in\r\ntheir doings; and it seemed to him that there was a barrier between\r\nthem and him. Sometimes they seemed to think that it was his fault if\r\nhe could not play football, and he was unable to make them understand.\r\nHe was left a good deal to himself. He had been inclined to\r\ntalkativeness, but gradually he became silent. He began to think of the\r\ndifference between himself and others.\r\n\r\nThe biggest boy in his dormitory, Singer, took a dislike to him, and\r\nPhilip, small for his age, had to put up with a good deal of hard\r\ntreatment. About half-way through the term a mania ran through the\r\nschool for a game called Nibs. It was a game for two, played on a table\r\nor a form with steel pens. You had to push your nib with the\r\nfinger-nail so as to get the point of it over your opponent\xe2\x80\x99s, while he\r\nmanoeuvred to prevent this and to get the point of his nib over the\r\nback of yours; when this result was achieved you breathed on the ball\r\nof your thumb, pressed it hard on the two nibs, and if you were able\r\nthen to lift them without dropping either, both nibs became yours. Soon\r\nnothing was seen but boys playing this game, and the more skilful\r\nacquired vast stores of nibs. But in a little while Mr. Watson made up\r\nhis mind that it was a form of gambling, forbade the game, and\r\nconfiscated all the nibs in the boys\xe2\x80\x99 possession. Philip had been very\r\nadroit, and it was with a heavy heart that he gave up his winning; but\r\nhis fingers itched to play still, and a few days later, on his way to\r\nthe football field, he went into a shop and bought a pennyworth of J\r\npens. He carried them loose in his pocket and enjoyed feeling them.\r\nPresently Singer found out that he had them. Singer had given up his\r\nnibs too, but he had kept back a very large one, called a Jumbo, which\r\nwas almost unconquerable, and he could not resist the opportunity of\r\ngetting Philip\xe2\x80\x99s Js out of him. Though Philip knew that he was at a\r\ndisadvantage with his small nibs, he had an adventurous disposition and\r\nwas willing to take the risk; besides, he was aware that Singer would\r\nnot allow him to refuse. He had not played for a week and sat down to\r\nthe game now with a thrill of excitement. He lost two of his small nibs\r\nquickly, and Singer was jubilant, but the third time by some chance the\r\nJumbo slipped round and Philip was able to push his J across it. He\r\ncrowed with triumph. At that moment Mr. Watson came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked from Singer to Philip, but neither answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve forbidden you to play that idiotic game?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat fast. He knew what was coming and was dreadfully\r\nfrightened, but in his fright there was a certain exultation. He had\r\nnever been swished. Of course it would hurt, but it was something to\r\nboast about afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into my study.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe headmaster turned, and they followed him side by side Singer\r\nwhispered to Philip:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Watson pointed to Singer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBend over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPhilip, very white, saw the boy quiver at each stroke, and after the\r\nthird he heard him cry out. Three more followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do. Get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSinger stood up. The tears were streaming down his face. Philip stepped\r\nforward. Mr. Watson looked at him for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to cane you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a new boy. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t hit a\r\ncripple. Go away, both of you, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be naughty again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they got back into the school-room a group of boys, who had\r\nlearned in some mysterious way what was happening, were waiting for\r\nthem. They set upon Singer at once with eager questions. Singer faced\r\nthem, his face red with the pain and marks of tears still on his\r\ncheeks. He pointed with his head at Philip, who was standing a little\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got off because he\xe2\x80\x99s a cripple,\xe2\x80\x9d he said angrily.\r\n\r\nPhilip stood silent and flushed. He felt that they looked at him with\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many did you get?\xe2\x80\x9d one boy asked Singer.\r\n\r\nBut he did not answer. He was angry because he had been hurt\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to play Nibs with you again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njolly nice for you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t risk anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe quickly put out his foot and tripped Philip up. Philip was always\r\nrather unsteady on his feet, and he fell heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCripple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Singer.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the term he tormented Philip cruelly, and, though\r\nPhilip tried to keep out of his way, the school was so small that it\r\nwas impossible; he tried being friendly and jolly with him; he abased\r\nhimself, so far as to buy him a knife; but though Singer took the knife\r\nhe was not placated. Once or twice, driven beyond endurance, he hit and\r\nkicked the bigger boy, but Singer was so much stronger that Philip was\r\nhelpless, and he was always forced after more or less torture to beg\r\nhis pardon. It was that which rankled with Philip: he could not bear\r\nthe humiliation of apologies, which were wrung from him by pain greater\r\nthan he could bear. And what made it worse was that there seemed no end\r\nto his wretchedness; Singer was only eleven and would not go to the\r\nupper school till he was thirteen. Philip realised that he must live\r\ntwo years with a tormentor from whom there was no escape. He was only\r\nhappy while he was working and when he got into bed. And often there\r\nrecurred to him then that queer feeling that his life with all its\r\nmisery was nothing but a dream, and that he would awake in the morning\r\nin his own little bed in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years passed, and Philip was nearly twelve. He was in the first\r\nform, within two or three places of the top, and after Christmas when\r\nseveral boys would be leaving for the senior school he would be head\r\nboy. He had already quite a collection of prizes, worthless books on\r\nbad paper, but in gorgeous bindings decorated with the arms of the\r\nschool: his position had freed him from bullying, and he was not\r\nunhappy. His fellows forgave him his success because of his deformity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, it\xe2\x80\x99s jolly easy for him to get prizes,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing he CAN do but swat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had lost his early terror of Mr. Watson. He had grown used to the\r\nloud voice, and when the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s heavy hand was laid on his\r\nshoulder Philip discerned vaguely the intention of a caress. He had the\r\ngood memory which is more useful for scholastic achievements than\r\nmental power, and he knew Mr. Watson expected him to leave the\r\npreparatory school with a scholarship.\r\n\r\nBut he had grown very self-conscious. The new-born child does not\r\nrealise that his body is more a part of himself than surrounding\r\nobjects, and will play with his toes without any feeling that they\r\nbelong to him more than the rattle by his side; and it is only by\r\ndegrees, through pain, that he understands the fact of the body. And\r\nexperiences of the same kind are necessary for the individual to become\r\nconscious of himself; but here there is the difference that, although\r\neveryone becomes equally conscious of his body as a separate and\r\ncomplete organism, everyone does not become equally conscious of\r\nhimself as a complete and separate personality. The feeling of\r\napartness from others comes to most with puberty, but it is not always\r\ndeveloped to such a degree as to make the difference between the\r\nindividual and his fellows noticeable to the individual. It is such as\r\nhe, as little conscious of himself as the bee in a hive, who are the\r\nlucky in life, for they have the best chance of happiness: their\r\nactivities are shared by all, and their pleasures are only pleasures\r\nbecause they are enjoyed in common; you will see them on Whit-Monday\r\ndancing on Hampstead Heath, shouting at a football match, or from club\r\nwindows in Pall Mall cheering a royal procession. It is because of them\r\nthat man has been called a social animal.\r\n\r\nPhilip passed from the innocence of childhood to bitter consciousness\r\nof himself by the ridicule which his club-foot had excited. The\r\ncircumstances of his case were so peculiar that he could not apply to\r\nthem the ready-made rules which acted well enough in ordinary affairs,\r\nand he was forced to think for himself. The many books he had read\r\nfilled his mind with ideas which, because he only half understood them,\r\ngave more scope to his imagination. Beneath his painful shyness\r\nsomething was growing up within him, and obscurely he realised his\r\npersonality. But at times it gave him odd surprises; he did things, he\r\nknew not why, and afterwards when he thought of them found himself all\r\nat sea.\r\n\r\nThere was a boy called Luard between whom and Philip a friendship had\r\narisen, and one day, when they were playing together in the\r\nschool-room, Luard began to perform some trick with an ebony pen-holder\r\nof Philip\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t play the giddy ox,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll only break it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no sooner were the words out of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mouth than the pen-holder\r\nsnapped in two. Luard looked at Philip with dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears rolled down Philip\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, but he did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Luard, with surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get you\r\nanother one exactly the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about the pen-holder I care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, in a trembling\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9conly it was given me by my mater, just before she died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, Carey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip took the two pieces of the pen-holder and looked at them. He\r\ntried to restrain his sobs. He felt utterly miserable. And yet he could\r\nnot tell why, for he knew quite well that he had bought the pen-holder\r\nduring his last holidays at Blackstable for one and twopence. He did\r\nnot know in the least what had made him invent that pathetic story, but\r\nhe was quite as unhappy as though it had been true. The pious\r\natmosphere of the vicarage and the religious tone of the school had\r\nmade Philip\xe2\x80\x99s conscience very sensitive; he absorbed insensibly the\r\nfeeling about him that the Tempter was ever on the watch to gain his\r\nimmortal soul; and though he was not more truthful than most boys he\r\nnever told a lie without suffering from remorse. When he thought over\r\nthis incident he was very much distressed, and made up his mind that he\r\nmust go to Luard and tell him that the story was an invention. Though\r\nhe dreaded humiliation more than anything in the world, he hugged\r\nhimself for two or three days at the thought of the agonising joy of\r\nhumiliating himself to the Glory of God. But he never got any further.\r\nHe satisfied his conscience by the more comfortable method of\r\nexpressing his repentance only to the Almighty. But he could not\r\nunderstand why he should have been so genuinely affected by the story\r\nhe was making up. The tears that flowed down his grubby cheeks were\r\nreal tears. Then by some accident of association there occurred to him\r\nthat scene when Emma had told him of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, and, though he\r\ncould not speak for crying, he had insisted on going in to say good-bye\r\nto the Misses Watkin so that they might see his grief and pity him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThen a wave of religiosity passed through the school. Bad language was\r\nno longer heard, and the little nastinesses of small boys were looked\r\nupon with hostility; the bigger boys, like the lords temporal of the\r\nMiddle Ages, used the strength of their arms to persuade those weaker\r\nthan themselves to virtuous courses.\r\n\r\nPhilip, his restless mind avid for new things, became very devout. He\r\nheard soon that it was possible to join a Bible League, and wrote to\r\nLondon for particulars. These consisted in a form to be filled up with\r\nthe applicant\xe2\x80\x99s name, age, and school; a solemn declaration to be\r\nsigned that he would read a set portion of Holy Scripture every night\r\nfor a year; and a request for half a crown; this, it was explained, was\r\ndemanded partly to prove the earnestness of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s desire to\r\nbecome a member of the League, and partly to cover clerical expenses.\r\nPhilip duly sent the papers and the money, and in return received a\r\ncalendar worth about a penny, on which was set down the appointed\r\npassage to be read each day, and a sheet of paper on one side of which\r\nwas a picture of the Good Shepherd and a lamb, and on the other,\r\ndecoratively framed in red lines, a short prayer which had to be said\r\nbefore beginning to read.\r\n\r\nEvery evening he undressed as quickly as possible in order to have time\r\nfor his task before the gas was put out. He read industriously, as he\r\nread always, without criticism, stories of cruelty, deceit,\r\ningratitude, dishonesty, and low cunning. Actions which would have\r\nexcited his horror in the life about him, in the reading passed through\r\nhis mind without comment, because they were committed under the direct\r\ninspiration of God. The method of the League was to alternate a book of\r\nthe Old Testament with a book of the New, and one night Philip came\r\nacross these words of Jesus Christ:\r\n\r\nIf ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is\r\ndone to the fig-tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be\r\nthou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.\r\n\r\nAnd all this, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\nThey made no particular impression on him, but it happened that two or\r\nthree days later, being Sunday, the Canon in residence chose them for\r\nthe text of his sermon. Even if Philip had wanted to hear this it would\r\nhave been impossible, for the boys of King\xe2\x80\x99s School sit in the choir,\r\nand the pulpit stands at the corner of the transept so that the\r\npreacher\xe2\x80\x99s back is almost turned to them. The distance also is so great\r\nthat it needs a man with a fine voice and a knowledge of elocution to\r\nmake himself heard in the choir; and according to long usage the Canons\r\nof Tercanbury are chosen for their learning rather than for any\r\nqualities which might be of use in a cathedral church. But the words of\r\nthe text, perhaps because he had read them so short a while before,\r\ncame clearly enough to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s ears, and they seemed on a sudden to\r\nhave a personal application. He thought about them through most of the\r\nsermon, and that night, on getting into bed, he turned over the pages\r\nof the Gospel and found once more the passage. Though he believed\r\nimplicitly everything he saw in print, he had learned already that in\r\nthe Bible things that said one thing quite clearly often mysteriously\r\nmeant another. There was no one he liked to ask at school, so he kept\r\nthe question he had in mind till the Christmas holidays, and then one\r\nday he made an opportunity. It was after supper and prayers were just\r\nfinished. Mrs. Carey was counting the eggs that Mary Ann had brought in\r\nas usual and writing on each one the date. Philip stood at the table\r\nand pretended to turn listlessly the pages of the Bible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Uncle William, this passage here, does it really mean that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his finger against it as though he had come across it\r\naccidentally.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey looked up over his spectacles. He was holding The Blackstable\r\nTimes in front of the fire. It had come in that evening damp from the\r\npress, and the Vicar always aired it for ten minutes before he began to\r\nread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat passage is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this about if you have faith you can remove mountains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it says so in the Bible it is so, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Carey gently,\r\ntaking up the plate-basket.\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at his uncle for an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say that if you really believed you could move mountains\r\nyou could?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the grace of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, say good-night to your uncle, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Louisa. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot wanting to move a mountain tonight, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip allowed himself to be kissed on the forehead by his uncle and\r\npreceded Mrs. Carey upstairs. He had got the information he wanted. His\r\nlittle room was icy, and he shivered when he put on his nightshirt. But\r\nhe always felt that his prayers were more pleasing to God when he said\r\nthem under conditions of discomfort. The coldness of his hands and feet\r\nwere an offering to the Almighty. And tonight he sank on his knees;\r\nburied his face in his hands, and prayed to God with all his might that\r\nHe would make his club-foot whole. It was a very small thing beside the\r\nmoving of mountains. He knew that God could do it if He wished, and his\r\nown faith was complete. Next morning, finishing his prayers with the\r\nsame request, he fixed a date for the miracle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, God, in Thy loving mercy and goodness, if it be Thy will, please\r\nmake my foot all right on the night before I go back to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was glad to get his petition into a formula, and he repeated it\r\nlater in the dining-room during the short pause which the Vicar always\r\nmade after prayers, before he rose from his knees. He said it again in\r\nthe evening and again, shivering in his nightshirt, before he got into\r\nbed. And he believed. For once he looked forward with eagerness to the\r\nend of the holidays. He laughed to himself as he thought of his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nastonishment when he ran down the stairs three at a time; and after\r\nbreakfast he and Aunt Louisa would have to hurry out and buy a new pair\r\nof boots. At school they would be astounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa, Carey, what have you done with your foot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d he would answer casually, as though it were\r\nthe most natural thing in the world.\r\n\r\nHe would be able to play football. His heart leaped as he saw himself\r\nrunning, running, faster than any of the other boys. At the end of the\r\nEaster term there were the sports, and he would be able to go in for\r\nthe races; he rather fancied himself over the hurdles. It would be\r\nsplendid to be like everyone else, not to be stared at curiously by new\r\nboys who did not know about his deformity, nor at the baths in summer\r\nto need incredible precautions, while he was undressing, before he\r\ncould hide his foot in the water.\r\n\r\nHe prayed with all the power of his soul. No doubts assailed him. He\r\nwas confident in the word of God. And the night before he was to go\r\nback to school he went up to bed tremulous with excitement. There was\r\nsnow on the ground, and Aunt Louisa had allowed herself the\r\nunaccustomed luxury of a fire in her bed-room; but in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nroom it was so cold that his fingers were numb, and he had great\r\ndifficulty in undoing his collar. His teeth chattered. The idea came to\r\nhim that he must do something more than usual to attract the attention\r\nof God, and he turned back the rug which was in front of his bed so\r\nthat he could kneel on the bare boards; and then it struck him that his\r\nnightshirt was a softness that might displease his Maker, so he took it\r\noff and said his prayers naked. When he got into bed he was so cold\r\nthat for some time he could not sleep, but when he did, it was so\r\nsoundly that Mary Ann had to shake him when she brought in his hot\r\nwater next morning. She talked to him while she drew the curtains, but\r\nhe did not answer; he had remembered at once that this was the morning\r\nfor the miracle. His heart was filled with joy and gratitude. His first\r\ninstinct was to put down his hand and feel the foot which was whole\r\nnow, but to do this seemed to doubt the goodness of God. He knew that\r\nhis foot was well. But at last he made up his mind, and with the toes\r\nof his right foot he just touched his left. Then he passed his hand\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nHe limped downstairs just as Mary Ann was going into the dining-room\r\nfor prayers, and then he sat down to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very quiet this morning, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Louisa presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of the good breakfast he\xe2\x80\x99ll have at school to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Vicar.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip answered, it was in a way that always irritated his uncle,\r\nwith something that had nothing to do with the matter in hand. He\r\ncalled it a bad habit of wool-gathering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing you\xe2\x80\x99d asked God to do something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cand really\r\nbelieved it was going to happen, like moving a mountain, I mean, and\r\nyou had faith, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, what would it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a funny boy you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Louisa. \xe2\x80\x9cYou asked about moving\r\nmountains two or three weeks ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would just mean that you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got faith,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Uncle William.\r\n\r\nPhilip accepted the explanation. If God had not cured him, it was\r\nbecause he did not really believe. And yet he did not see how he could\r\nbelieve more than he did. But perhaps he had not given God enough time.\r\nHe had only asked Him for nineteen days. In a day or two he began his\r\nprayer again, and this time he fixed upon Easter. That was the day of\r\nHis Son\xe2\x80\x99s glorious resurrection, and God in His happiness might be\r\nmercifully inclined. But now Philip added other means of attaining his\r\ndesire: he began to wish, when he saw a new moon or a dappled horse,\r\nand he looked out for shooting stars; during exeat they had a chicken\r\nat the vicarage, and he broke the lucky bone with Aunt Louisa and\r\nwished again, each time that his foot might be made whole. He was\r\nappealing unconsciously to gods older to his race than the God of\r\nIsrael. And he bombarded the Almighty with his prayer, at odd times of\r\nthe day, whenever it occurred to him, in identical words always, for it\r\nseemed to him important to make his request in the same terms. But\r\npresently the feeling came to him that this time also his faith would\r\nnot be great enough. He could not resist the doubt that assailed him.\r\nHe made his own experience into a general rule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose no one ever has faith enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nIt was like the salt which his nurse used to tell him about: you could\r\ncatch any bird by putting salt on his tail; and once he had taken a\r\nlittle bag of it into Kensington Gardens. But he could never get near\r\nenough to put the salt on a bird\xe2\x80\x99s tail. Before Easter he had given up\r\nthe struggle. He felt a dull resentment against his uncle for taking\r\nhim in. The text which spoke of the moving of mountains was just one of\r\nthose that said one thing and meant another. He thought his uncle had\r\nbeen playing a practical joke on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King\xe2\x80\x99s School at Tercanbury, to which Philip went when he was\r\nthirteen, prided itself on its antiquity. It traced its origin to an\r\nabbey school, founded before the Conquest, where the rudiments of\r\nlearning were taught by Augustine monks; and, like many another\r\nestablishment of this sort, on the destruction of the monasteries it\r\nhad been reorganised by the officers of King Henry VIII and thus\r\nacquired its name. Since then, pursuing its modest course, it had given\r\nto the sons of the local gentry and of the professional people of Kent\r\nan education sufficient to their needs. One or two men of letters,\r\nbeginning with a poet, than whom only Shakespeare had a more splendid\r\ngenius, and ending with a writer of prose whose view of life has\r\naffected profoundly the generation of which Philip was a member, had\r\ngone forth from its gates to achieve fame; it had produced one or two\r\neminent lawyers, but eminent lawyers are common, and one or two\r\nsoldiers of distinction; but during the three centuries since its\r\nseparation from the monastic order it had trained especially men of the\r\nchurch, bishops, deans, canons, and above all country clergymen: there\r\nwere boys in the school whose fathers, grandfathers,\r\ngreat-grandfathers, had been educated there and had all been rectors of\r\nparishes in the diocese of Tercanbury; and they came to it with their\r\nminds made up already to be ordained. But there were signs\r\nnotwithstanding that even there changes were coming; for a few,\r\nrepeating what they had heard at home, said that the Church was no\r\nlonger what it used to be. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much the money; but the class\r\nof people who went in for it weren\xe2\x80\x99t the same; and two or three boys\r\nknew curates whose fathers were tradesmen: they\xe2\x80\x99d rather go out to the\r\nColonies (in those days the Colonies were still the last hope of those\r\nwho could get nothing to do in England) than be a curate under some\r\nchap who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman. At King\xe2\x80\x99s School, as at Blackstable\r\nVicarage, a tradesman was anyone who was not lucky enough to own land\r\n(and here a fine distinction was made between the gentleman farmer and\r\nthe landowner), or did not follow one of the four professions to which\r\nit was possible for a gentleman to belong. Among the day-boys, of whom\r\nthere were about a hundred and fifty, sons of the local gentry and of\r\nthe men stationed at the depot, those whose fathers were engaged in\r\nbusiness were made to feel the degradation of their state.\r\n\r\nThe masters had no patience with modern ideas of education, which they\r\nread of sometimes in The Times or The Guardian, and hoped fervently\r\nthat King\xe2\x80\x99s School would remain true to its old traditions. The dead\r\nlanguages were taught with such thoroughness that an old boy seldom\r\nthought of Homer or Virgil in after life without a qualm of boredom;\r\nand though in the common room at dinner one or two bolder spirits\r\nsuggested that mathematics were of increasing importance, the general\r\nfeeling was that they were a less noble study than the classics.\r\nNeither German nor chemistry was taught, and French only by the\r\nform-masters; they could keep order better than a foreigner, and, since\r\nthey knew the grammar as well as any Frenchman, it seemed unimportant\r\nthat none of them could have got a cup of coffee in the restaurant at\r\nBoulogne unless the waiter had known a little English. Geography was\r\ntaught chiefly by making boys draw maps, and this was a favourite\r\noccupation, especially when the country dealt with was mountainous: it\r\nwas possible to waste a great deal of time in drawing the Andes or the\r\nApennines. The masters, graduates of Oxford or Cambridge, were ordained\r\nand unmarried; if by chance they wished to marry they could only do so\r\nby accepting one of the smaller livings at the disposal of the Chapter;\r\nbut for many years none of them had cared to leave the refined society\r\nof Tercanbury, which owing to the cavalry depot had a martial as well\r\nas an ecclesiastical tone, for the monotony of life in a country\r\nrectory; and they were now all men of middle age.\r\n\r\nThe headmaster, on the other hand, was obliged to be married and he\r\nconducted the school till age began to tell upon him. When he retired\r\nhe was rewarded with a much better living than any of the under-masters\r\ncould hope for, and an honorary Canonry.\r\n\r\nBut a year before Philip entered the school a great change had come\r\nover it. It had been obvious for some time that Dr. Fleming, who had\r\nbeen headmaster for the quarter of a century, was become too deaf to\r\ncontinue his work to the greater glory of God; and when one of the\r\nlivings on the outskirts of the city fell vacant, with a stipend of six\r\nhundred a year, the Chapter offered it to him in such a manner as to\r\nimply that they thought it high time for him to retire. He could nurse\r\nhis ailments comfortably on such an income. Two or three curates who\r\nhad hoped for preferment told their wives it was scandalous to give a\r\nparish that needed a young, strong, and energetic man to an old fellow\r\nwho knew nothing of parochial work, and had feathered his nest already;\r\nbut the mutterings of the unbeneficed clergy do not reach the ears of a\r\ncathedral Chapter. And as for the parishioners they had nothing to say\r\nin the matter, and therefore nobody asked for their opinion. The\r\nWesleyans and the Baptists both had chapels in the village.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Fleming was thus disposed of it became necessary to find a\r\nsuccessor. It was contrary to the traditions of the school that one of\r\nthe lower-masters should be chosen. The common-room was unanimous in\r\ndesiring the election of Mr. Watson, headmaster of the preparatory\r\nschool; he could hardly be described as already a master of King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSchool, they had all known him for twenty years, and there was no\r\ndanger that he would make a nuisance of himself. But the Chapter sprang\r\na surprise on them. It chose a man called Perkins. At first nobody knew\r\nwho Perkins was, and the name favourably impressed no one; but before\r\nthe shock of it had passed away, it was realised that Perkins was the\r\nson of Perkins the linendraper. Dr. Fleming informed the masters just\r\nbefore dinner, and his manner showed his consternation. Such of them as\r\nwere dining in, ate their meal almost in silence, and no reference was\r\nmade to the matter till the servants had left the room. Then they set\r\nto. The names of those present on this occasion are unimportant, but\r\nthey had been known to generations of school-boys as Sighs, Tar, Winks,\r\nSquirts, and Pat.\r\n\r\nThey all knew Tom Perkins. The first thing about him was that he was\r\nnot a gentleman. They remembered him quite well. He was a small, dark\r\nboy, with untidy black hair and large eyes. He looked like a gipsy. He\r\nhad come to the school as a day-boy, with the best scholarship on their\r\nendowment, so that his education had cost him nothing. Of course he was\r\nbrilliant. At every Speech-Day he was loaded with prizes. He was their\r\nshow-boy, and they remembered now bitterly their fear that he would try\r\nto get some scholarship at one of the larger public schools and so pass\r\nout of their hands. Dr. Fleming had gone to the linendraper his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94they all remembered the shop, Perkins and Cooper, in St.\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s Street\xe2\x80\x94and said he hoped Tom would remain with them till he\r\nwent to Oxford. The school was Perkins and Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s best customer, and\r\nMr. Perkins was only too glad to give the required assurance. Tom\r\nPerkins continued to triumph, he was the finest classical scholar that\r\nDr. Fleming remembered, and on leaving the school took with him the\r\nmost valuable scholarship they had to offer. He got another at Magdalen\r\nand settled down to a brilliant career at the University. The school\r\nmagazine recorded the distinctions he achieved year after year, and\r\nwhen he got his double first Dr. Fleming himself wrote a few words of\r\neulogy on the front page. It was with greater satisfaction that they\r\nwelcomed his success, since Perkins and Cooper had fallen upon evil\r\ndays: Cooper drank like a fish, and just before Tom Perkins took his\r\ndegree the linendrapers filed their petition in bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIn due course Tom Perkins took Holy Orders and entered upon the\r\nprofession for which he was so admirably suited. He had been an\r\nassistant master at Wellington and then at Rugby.\r\n\r\nBut there was quite a difference between welcoming his success at other\r\nschools and serving under his leadership in their own. Tar had\r\nfrequently given him lines, and Squirts had boxed his ears. They could\r\nnot imagine how the Chapter had made such a mistake. No one could be\r\nexpected to forget that he was the son of a bankrupt linendraper, and\r\nthe alcoholism of Cooper seemed to increase the disgrace. It was\r\nunderstood that the Dean had supported his candidature with zeal, so\r\nthe Dean would probably ask him to dinner; but would the pleasant\r\nlittle dinners in the precincts ever be the same when Tom Perkins sat\r\nat the table? And what about the depot? He really could not expect\r\nofficers and gentlemen to receive him as one of themselves. It would do\r\nthe school incalculable harm. Parents would be dissatisfied, and no one\r\ncould be surprised if there were wholesale withdrawals. And then the\r\nindignity of calling him Mr. Perkins! The masters thought by way of\r\nprotest of sending in their resignations in a body, but the uneasy fear\r\nthat they would be accepted with equanimity restrained them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is to prepare ourselves for changes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sighs, who\r\nhad conducted the fifth form for five and twenty years with\r\nunparalleled incompetence.\r\n\r\nAnd when they saw him they were not reassured. Dr. Fleming invited them\r\nto meet him at luncheon. He was now a man of thirty-two, tall and lean,\r\nbut with the same wild and unkempt look they remembered on him as a\r\nboy. His clothes, ill-made and shabby, were put on untidily. His hair\r\nwas as black and as long as ever, and he had plainly never learned to\r\nbrush it; it fell over his forehead with every gesture, and he had a\r\nquick movement of the hand with which he pushed it back from his eyes.\r\nHe had a black moustache and a beard which came high up on his face\r\nalmost to the cheek-bones, He talked to the masters quite easily, as\r\nthough he had parted from them a week or two before; he was evidently\r\ndelighted to see them. He seemed unconscious of the strangeness of the\r\nposition and appeared not to notice any oddness in being addressed as\r\nMr. Perkins.\r\n\r\nWhen he bade them good-bye, one of the masters, for something to say,\r\nremarked that he was allowing himself plenty of time to catch his\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go round and have a look at the shop,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\nThere was a distinct embarrassment. They wondered that he could be so\r\ntactless, and to make it worse Dr. Fleming had not heard what he said.\r\nHis wife shouted it in his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to go round and look at his father\xe2\x80\x99s old shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnly Tom Perkins was unconscious of the humiliation which the whole\r\nparty felt. He turned to Mrs. Fleming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s got it now, d\xe2\x80\x99you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could hardly answer. She was very angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still a linendraper\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d she said bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cGrove is the name. We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deal there any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99d let me go over the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect he would if you explain who you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not till the end of dinner that evening that any reference was\r\nmade in the common-room to the subject that was in all their minds.\r\nThen it was Sighs who asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did you think of our new head?\xe2\x80\x9d They thought of the\r\nconversation at luncheon. It was hardly a conversation; it was a\r\nmonologue. Perkins had talked incessantly. He talked very quickly, with\r\na flow of easy words and in a deep, resonant voice. He had a short, odd\r\nlittle laugh which showed his white teeth. They had followed him with\r\ndifficulty, for his mind darted from subject to subject with a\r\nconnection they did not always catch. He talked of pedagogics, and this\r\nwas natural enough; but he had much to say of modern theories in\r\nGermany which they had never heard of and received with misgiving. He\r\ntalked of the classics, but he had been to Greece, and he discoursed of\r\narchaeology; he had once spent a winter digging; they could not see how\r\nthat helped a man to teach boys to pass examinations, He talked of\r\npolitics. It sounded odd to them to hear him compare Lord Beaconsfield\r\nwith Alcibiades. He talked of Mr. Gladstone and Home Rule. They\r\nrealised that he was a Liberal. Their hearts sank. He talked of German\r\nphilosophy and of French fiction. They could not think a man profound\r\nwhose interests were so diverse.\r\n\r\nIt was Winks who summed up the general impression and put it into a\r\nform they all felt conclusively damning. Winks was the master of the\r\nupper third, a weak-kneed man with drooping eye-lids, He was too tall\r\nfor his strength, and his movements were slow and languid. He gave an\r\nimpression of lassitude, and his nickname was eminently appropriate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very enthusiastic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winks.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm was ill-bred. Enthusiasm was ungentlemanly. They thought of\r\nthe Salvation Army with its braying trumpets and its drums. Enthusiasm\r\nmeant change. They had goose-flesh when they thought of all the\r\npleasant old habits which stood in imminent danger. They hardly dared\r\nto look forward to the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks more of a gipsy than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if the Dean and Chapter knew that he was a Radical when they\r\nelected him,\xe2\x80\x9d another observed bitterly.\r\n\r\nBut conversation halted. They were too much disturbed for words.\r\n\r\nWhen Tar and Sighs were walking together to the Chapter House on\r\nSpeech-Day a week later, Tar, who had a bitter tongue, remarked to his\r\ncolleague:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a good many Speech-Days here, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we? I wonder if\r\nwe shall see another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSighs was more melancholy even than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anything worth having comes along in the way of a living I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind when I retire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nA year passed, and when Philip came to the school the old masters were\r\nall in their places; but a good many changes had taken place\r\nnotwithstanding their stubborn resistance, none the less formidable\r\nbecause it was concealed under an apparent desire to fall in with the\r\nnew head\xe2\x80\x99s ideas. Though the form-masters still taught French to the\r\nlower school, another master had come, with a degree of doctor of\r\nphilology from the University of Heidelberg and a record of three years\r\nspent in a French lycee, to teach French to the upper forms and German\r\nto anyone who cared to take it up instead of Greek. Another master was\r\nengaged to teach mathematics more systematically than had been found\r\nnecessary hitherto. Neither of these was ordained. This was a real\r\nrevolution, and when the pair arrived the older masters received them\r\nwith distrust. A laboratory had been fitted up, army classes were\r\ninstituted; they all said the character of the school was changing. And\r\nheaven only knew what further projects Mr. Perkins turned in that\r\nuntidy head of his. The school was small as public schools go, there\r\nwere not more than two hundred boarders; and it was difficult for it to\r\ngrow larger, for it was huddled up against the Cathedral; the\r\nprecincts, with the exception of a house in which some of the masters\r\nlodged, were occupied by the cathedral clergy; and there was no more\r\nroom for building. But Mr. Perkins devised an elaborate scheme by which\r\nhe might obtain sufficient space to make the school double its present\r\nsize. He wanted to attract boys from London. He thought it would be\r\ngood for them to be thrown in contact with the Kentish lads, and it\r\nwould sharpen the country wits of these.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s against all our traditions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sighs, when Mr. Perkins made\r\nthe suggestion to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve rather gone out of our way to avoid the\r\ncontamination of boys from London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Perkins.\r\n\r\nNo one had ever told the form-master before that he talked nonsense,\r\nand he was meditating an acid reply, in which perhaps he might insert a\r\nveiled reference to hosiery, when Mr. Perkins in his impetuous way\r\nattacked him outrageously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat house in the precincts\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99d only marry I\xe2\x80\x99d get the Chapter to\r\nput another couple of stories on, and we\xe2\x80\x99d make dormitories and\r\nstudies, and your wife could help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elderly clergyman gasped. Why should he marry? He was fifty-seven,\r\na man couldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry at fifty-seven. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t start looking after a\r\nhouse at his time of life. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry. If the choice lay\r\nbetween that and the country living he would much sooner resign. All he\r\nwanted now was peace and quietness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking of marrying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins looked at him with his dark, bright eyes, and if there was\r\na twinkle in them poor Sighs never saw it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity! Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you marry to oblige me? It would help me a great\r\ndeal with the Dean and Chapter when I suggest rebuilding your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 most unpopular innovation was his system of taking\r\noccasionally another man\xe2\x80\x99s form. He asked it as a favour, but after all\r\nit was a favour which could not be refused, and as Tar, otherwise Mr.\r\nTurner, said, it was undignified for all parties. He gave no warning,\r\nbut after morning prayers would say to one of the masters:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99d mind taking the Sixth today at eleven. We\xe2\x80\x99ll change\r\nover, shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not know whether this was usual at other schools, but\r\ncertainly it had never been done at Tercanbury. The results were\r\ncurious. Mr. Turner, who was the first victim, broke the news to his\r\nform that the headmaster would take them for Latin that day, and on the\r\npretence that they might like to ask him a question or two so that they\r\nshould not make perfect fools of themselves, spent the last quarter of\r\nan hour of the history lesson in construing for them the passage of\r\nLivy which had been set for the day; but when he rejoined his class and\r\nlooked at the paper on which Mr. Perkins had written the marks, a\r\nsurprise awaited him; for the two boys at the top of the form seemed to\r\nhave done very ill, while others who had never distinguished themselves\r\nbefore were given full marks. When he asked Eldridge, his cleverest\r\nboy, what was the meaning of this the answer came sullenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Perkins never gave us any construing to do. He asked me what I\r\nknew about General Gordon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Turner looked at him in astonishment. The boys evidently felt they\r\nhad been hardly used, and he could not help agreeing with their silent\r\ndissatisfaction. He could not see either what General Gordon had to do\r\nwith Livy. He hazarded an inquiry afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEldridge was dreadfully put out because you asked him what he knew\r\nabout General Gordon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the headmaster, with an attempt at a\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw they\xe2\x80\x99d got to the agrarian laws of Caius Gracchus, and I\r\nwondered if they knew anything about the agrarian troubles in Ireland.\r\nBut all they knew about Ireland was that Dublin was on the Liffey. So I\r\nwondered if they\xe2\x80\x99d ever heard of General Gordon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the horrid fact was disclosed that the new head had a mania for\r\ngeneral information. He had doubts about the utility of examinations on\r\nsubjects which had been crammed for the occasion. He wanted common\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nSighs grew more worried every month; he could not get the thought out\r\nof his head that Mr. Perkins would ask him to fix a day for his\r\nmarriage; and he hated the attitude the head adopted towards classical\r\nliterature. There was no doubt that he was a fine scholar, and he was\r\nengaged on a work which was quite in the right tradition: he was\r\nwriting a treatise on the trees in Latin literature; but he talked of\r\nit flippantly, as though it were a pastime of no great importance, like\r\nbilliards, which engaged his leisure but was not to be considered with\r\nseriousness. And Squirts, the master of the Middle Third, grew more\r\nill-tempered every day.\r\n\r\nIt was in his form that Philip was put on entering the school. The Rev.\r\nB. B. Gordon was a man by nature ill-suited to be a schoolmaster: he\r\nwas impatient and choleric. With no one to call him to account, with\r\nonly small boys to face him, he had long lost all power of\r\nself-control. He began his work in a rage and ended it in a passion. He\r\nwas a man of middle height and of a corpulent figure; he had sandy\r\nhair, worn very short and now growing gray, and a small bristly\r\nmoustache. His large face, with indistinct features and small blue\r\neyes, was naturally red, but during his frequent attacks of anger it\r\ngrew dark and purple. His nails were bitten to the quick, for while\r\nsome trembling boy was construing he would sit at his desk shaking with\r\nthe fury that consumed him, and gnaw his fingers. Stories, perhaps\r\nexaggerated, were told of his violence, and two years before there had\r\nbeen some excitement in the school when it was heard that one father\r\nwas threatening a prosecution: he had boxed the ears of a boy named\r\nWalters with a book so violently that his hearing was affected and the\r\nboy had to be taken away from the school. The boy\xe2\x80\x99s father lived in\r\nTercanbury, and there had been much indignation in the city, the local\r\npaper had referred to the matter; but Mr. Walters was only a brewer, so\r\nthe sympathy was divided. The rest of the boys, for reasons best known\r\nto themselves, though they loathed the master, took his side in the\r\naffair, and, to show their indignation that the school\xe2\x80\x99s business had\r\nbeen dealt with outside, made things as uncomfortable as they could for\r\nWalters\xe2\x80\x99 younger brother, who still remained. But Mr. Gordon had only\r\nescaped the country living by the skin of his teeth, and he had never\r\nhit a boy since. The right the masters possessed to cane boys on the\r\nhand was taken away from them, and Squirts could no longer emphasize\r\nhis anger by beating his desk with the cane. He never did more now than\r\ntake a boy by the shoulders and shake him. He still made a naughty or\r\nrefractory lad stand with one arm stretched out for anything from ten\r\nminutes to half an hour, and he was as violent as before with his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nNo master could have been more unfitted to teach things to so shy a boy\r\nas Philip. He had come to the school with fewer terrors than he had\r\nwhen first he went to Mr. Watson\xe2\x80\x99s. He knew a good many boys who had\r\nbeen with him at the preparatory school. He felt more grownup, and\r\ninstinctively realised that among the larger numbers his deformity\r\nwould be less noticeable. But from the first day Mr. Gordon struck\r\nterror in his heart; and the master, quick to discern the boys who were\r\nfrightened of him, seemed on that account to take a peculiar dislike to\r\nhim. Philip had enjoyed his work, but now he began to look upon the\r\nhours passed in school with horror. Rather than risk an answer which\r\nmight be wrong and excite a storm of abuse from the master, he would\r\nsit stupidly silent, and when it came towards his turn to stand up and\r\nconstrue he grew sick and white with apprehension. His happy moments\r\nwere those when Mr. Perkins took the form. He was able to gratify the\r\npassion for general knowledge which beset the headmaster; he had read\r\nall sorts of strange books beyond his years, and often Mr. Perkins,\r\nwhen a question was going round the room, would stop at Philip with a\r\nsmile that filled the boy with rapture, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Carey, you tell them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good marks he got on these occasions increased Mr. Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindignation. One day it came to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s turn to translate, and the\r\nmaster sat there glaring at him and furiously biting his thumb. He was\r\nin a ferocious mood. Philip began to speak in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mumble,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the master.\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to stick in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on. Go on. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach time the words were screamed more loudly. The effect was to drive\r\nall he knew out of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s head, and he looked at the printed page\r\nvacantly. Mr. Gordon began to breathe heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t know why don\xe2\x80\x99t you say so? Do you know it or not? Did you\r\nhear all this construed last time or not? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak? Speak,\r\nyou blockhead, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe master seized the arms of his chair and grasped them as though to\r\nprevent himself from falling upon Philip. They knew that in past days\r\nhe often used to seize boys by the throat till they almost choked. The\r\nveins in his forehead stood out and his face grew dark and threatening.\r\nHe was a man insane.\r\n\r\nPhilip had known the passage perfectly the day before, but now he could\r\nremember nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know it,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it? Let\xe2\x80\x99s take the words one by one. We\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see\r\nif you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip stood silent, very white, trembling a little, with his head bent\r\ndown on the book. The master\xe2\x80\x99s breathing grew almost stertorous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe headmaster says you\xe2\x80\x99re clever. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how he sees it.\r\nGeneral information.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed savagely. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they put\r\nyou in his form for, Blockhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was pleased with the word, and he repeated it at the top of his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlockhead! Blockhead! Club-footed blockhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat relieved him a little. He saw Philip redden suddenly. He told him\r\nto fetch the Black Book. Philip put down his Caesar and went silently\r\nout. The Black Book was a sombre volume in which the names of boys were\r\nwritten with their misdeeds, and when a name was down three times it\r\nmeant a caning. Philip went to the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s house and knocked at\r\nhis study-door. Mr. Perkins was seated at his table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I have the Black Book, please, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Perkins, indicating its place by a nod of\r\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins gave him a quick look, but without answering went on with\r\nhis work. Philip took the book and went out. When the hour was up, a\r\nfew minutes later, he brought it back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me have a look at it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the headmaster. \xe2\x80\x9cI see Mr. Gordon has\r\nblack-booked you for \xe2\x80\x98gross impertinence.\xe2\x80\x99 What was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir. Mr. Gordon said I was a club-footed blockhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins looked at him again. He wondered whether there was sarcasm\r\nbehind the boy\xe2\x80\x99s reply, but he was still much too shaken. His face was\r\nwhite and his eyes had a look of terrified distress. Mr. Perkins got up\r\nand put the book down. As he did so he took up some photographs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of mine sent me some pictures of Athens this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid casually. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, there\xe2\x80\x99s the Akropolis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began explaining to Philip what he saw. The ruin grew vivid with his\r\nwords. He showed him the theatre of Dionysus and explained in what\r\norder the people sat, and how beyond they could see the blue Aegean.\r\nAnd then suddenly he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember Mr. Gordon used to call me a gipsy counter-jumper when I\r\nwas in his form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd before Philip, his mind fixed on the photographs, had time to\r\ngather the meaning of the remark, Mr. Perkins was showing him a picture\r\nof Salamis, and with his finger, a finger of which the nail had a\r\nlittle black edge to it, was pointing out how the Greek ships were\r\nplaced and how the Persian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip passed the next two years with comfortable monotony. He was not\r\nbullied more than other boys of his size; and his deformity,\r\nwithdrawing him from games, acquired for him an insignificance for\r\nwhich he was grateful. He was not popular, and he was very lonely. He\r\nspent a couple of terms with Winks in the Upper Third. Winks, with his\r\nweary manner and his drooping eyelids, looked infinitely bored. He did\r\nhis duty, but he did it with an abstracted mind. He was kind, gentle,\r\nand foolish. He had a great belief in the honour of boys; he felt that\r\nthe first thing to make them truthful was not to let it enter your head\r\nfor a moment that it was possible for them to lie. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk much,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nquoted, \xe2\x80\x9cand much shall be given to you.\xe2\x80\x9d Life was easy in the Upper\r\nThird. You knew exactly what lines would come to your turn to construe,\r\nand with the crib that passed from hand to hand you could find out all\r\nyou wanted in two minutes; you could hold a Latin Grammar open on your\r\nknees while questions were passing round; and Winks never noticed\r\nanything odd in the fact that the same incredible mistake was to be\r\nfound in a dozen different exercises. He had no great faith in\r\nexaminations, for he noticed that boys never did so well in them as in\r\nform: it was disappointing, but not significant. In due course they\r\nwere moved up, having learned little but a cheerful effrontery in the\r\ndistortion of truth, which was possibly of greater service to them in\r\nafter life than an ability to read Latin at sight.\r\n\r\nThen they fell into the hands of Tar. His name was Turner; he was the\r\nmost vivacious of the old masters, a short man with an immense belly, a\r\nblack beard turning now to gray, and a swarthy skin. In his clerical\r\ndress there was indeed something in him to suggest the tar-barrel; and\r\nthough on principle he gave five hundred lines to any boy on whose lips\r\nhe overheard his nickname, at dinner-parties in the precincts he often\r\nmade little jokes about it. He was the most worldly of the masters; he\r\ndined out more frequently than any of the others, and the society he\r\nkept was not so exclusively clerical. The boys looked upon him as\r\nrather a dog. He left off his clerical attire during the holidays and\r\nhad been seen in Switzerland in gay tweeds. He liked a bottle of wine\r\nand a good dinner, and having once been seen at the Cafe Royal with a\r\nlady who was very probably a near relation, was thenceforward supposed\r\nby generations of schoolboys to indulge in orgies the circumstantial\r\ndetails of which pointed to an unbounded belief in human depravity.\r\n\r\nMr. Turner reckoned that it took him a term to lick boys into shape\r\nafter they had been in the Upper Third; and now and then he let fall a\r\nsly hint, which showed that he knew perfectly what went on in his\r\ncolleague\xe2\x80\x99s form. He took it good-humouredly. He looked upon boys as\r\nyoung ruffians who were more apt to be truthful if it was quite certain\r\na lie would be found out, whose sense of honour was peculiar to\r\nthemselves and did not apply to dealings with masters, and who were\r\nleast likely to be troublesome when they learned that it did not pay.\r\nHe was proud of his form and as eager at fifty-five that it should do\r\nbetter in examinations than any of the others as he had been when he\r\nfirst came to the school. He had the choler of the obese, easily roused\r\nand as easily calmed, and his boys soon discovered that there was much\r\nkindliness beneath the invective with which he constantly assailed\r\nthem. He had no patience with fools, but was willing to take much\r\ntrouble with boys whom he suspected of concealing intelligence behind\r\ntheir wilfulness. He was fond of inviting them to tea; and, though\r\nvowing they never got a look in with him at the cakes and muffins, for\r\nit was the fashion to believe that his corpulence pointed to a\r\nvoracious appetite, and his voracious appetite to tapeworms, they\r\naccepted his invitations with real pleasure.\r\n\r\nPhilip was now more comfortable, for space was so limited that there\r\nwere only studies for boys in the upper school, and till then he had\r\nlived in the great hall in which they all ate and in which the lower\r\nforms did preparation in a promiscuity which was vaguely distasteful to\r\nhim. Now and then it made him restless to be with people and he wanted\r\nurgently to be alone. He set out for solitary walks into the country.\r\nThere was a little stream, with pollards on both sides of it, that ran\r\nthrough green fields, and it made him happy, he knew not why, to wander\r\nalong its banks. When he was tired he lay face-downward on the grass\r\nand watched the eager scurrying of minnows and of tadpoles. It gave him\r\na peculiar satisfaction to saunter round the precincts. On the green in\r\nthe middle they practised at nets in the summer, but during the rest of\r\nthe year it was quiet: boys used to wander round sometimes arm in arm,\r\nor a studious fellow with abstracted gaze walked slowly, repeating to\r\nhimself something he had to learn by heart. There was a colony of rooks\r\nin the great elms, and they filled the air with melancholy cries. Along\r\none side lay the Cathedral with its great central tower, and Philip,\r\nwho knew as yet nothing of beauty, felt when he looked at it a\r\ntroubling delight which he could not understand. When he had a study\r\n(it was a little square room looking on a slum, and four boys shared\r\nit), he bought a photograph of that view of the Cathedral, and pinned\r\nit up over his desk. And he found himself taking a new interest in what\r\nhe saw from the window of the Fourth Form room. It looked on to old\r\nlawns, carefully tended, and fine trees with foliage dense and rich. It\r\ngave him an odd feeling in his heart, and he did not know if it was\r\npain or pleasure. It was the first dawn of the aesthetic emotion. It\r\naccompanied other changes. His voice broke. It was no longer quite\r\nunder his control, and queer sounds issued from his throat.\r\n\r\nThen he began to go to the classes which were held in the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy, immediately after tea, to prepare boys for confirmation.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s piety had not stood the test of time, and he had long since\r\ngiven up his nightly reading of the Bible; but now, under the influence\r\nof Mr. Perkins, with this new condition of the body which made him so\r\nrestless, his old feelings revived, and he reproached himself bitterly\r\nfor his backsliding. The fires of Hell burned fiercely before his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x99s eye. If he had died during that time when he was little better\r\nthan an infidel he would have been lost; he believed implicitly in pain\r\neverlasting, he believed in it much more than in eternal happiness; and\r\nhe shuddered at the dangers he had run.\r\n\r\nSince the day on which Mr. Perkins had spoken kindly to him, when he\r\nwas smarting under the particular form of abuse which he could least\r\nbear, Philip had conceived for his headmaster a dog-like adoration. He\r\nracked his brains vainly for some way to please him. He treasured the\r\nsmallest word of commendation which by chance fell from his lips. And\r\nwhen he came to the quiet little meetings in his house he was prepared\r\nto surrender himself entirely. He kept his eyes fixed on Mr. Perkins\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshining eyes, and sat with mouth half open, his head a little thrown\r\nforward so as to miss no word. The ordinariness of the surroundings\r\nmade the matters they dealt with extraordinarily moving. And often the\r\nmaster, seized himself by the wonder of his subject, would push back\r\nthe book in front of him, and with his hands clasped together over his\r\nheart, as though to still the beating, would talk of the mysteries of\r\ntheir religion. Sometimes Philip did not understand, but he did not\r\nwant to understand, he felt vaguely that it was enough to feel. It\r\nseemed to him then that the headmaster, with his black, straggling hair\r\nand his pale face, was like those prophets of Israel who feared not to\r\ntake kings to task; and when he thought of the Redeemer he saw Him only\r\nwith the same dark eyes and those wan cheeks.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins took this part of his work with great seriousness. There\r\nwas never here any of that flashing humour which made the other masters\r\nsuspect him of flippancy. Finding time for everything in his busy day,\r\nhe was able at certain intervals to take separately for a quarter of an\r\nhour or twenty minutes the boys whom he was preparing for confirmation.\r\nHe wanted to make them feel that this was the first consciously serious\r\nstep in their lives; he tried to grope into the depths of their souls;\r\nhe wanted to instil in them his own vehement devotion. In Philip,\r\nnotwithstanding his shyness, he felt the possibility of a passion equal\r\nto his own. The boy\xe2\x80\x99s temperament seemed to him essentially religious.\r\nOne day he broke off suddenly from the subject on which he had been\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you thought at all what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be when you grow up?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle wants me to be ordained,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked away. He was ashamed to answer that he felt himself\r\nunworthy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any life that\xe2\x80\x99s so full of happiness as ours. I wish I\r\ncould make you feel what a wonderful privilege it is. One can serve God\r\nin every walk, but we stand nearer to Him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to influence\r\nyou, but if you made up your mind\xe2\x80\x94oh, at once\xe2\x80\x94you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling\r\nthat joy and relief which never desert one again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not answer, but the headmaster read in his eyes that he\r\nrealised already something of what he tried to indicate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you go on as you are now you\xe2\x80\x99ll find yourself head of the school\r\none of these days, and you ought to be pretty safe for a scholarship\r\nwhen you leave. Have you got anything of your own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle says I shall have a hundred a year when I\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be rich. I had nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe headmaster hesitated a moment, and then, idly drawing lines with a\r\npencil on the blotting paper in front of him, went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid your choice of professions will be rather limited. You\r\nnaturally couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go in for anything that required physical activity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened to the roots of his hair, as he always did when any\r\nreference was made to his club-foot. Mr. Perkins looked at him gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99re not oversensitive about your misfortune. Has it\r\never struck you to thank God for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked up quickly. His lips tightened. He remembered how for\r\nmonths, trusting in what they told him, he had implored God to heal him\r\nas He had healed the Leper and made the Blind to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as you accept it rebelliously it can only cause you shame. But\r\nif you looked upon it as a cross that was given you to bear only\r\nbecause your shoulders were strong enough to bear it, a sign of God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavour, then it would be a source of happiness to you instead of\r\nmisery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw that the boy hated to discuss the matter and he let him go.\r\n\r\nBut Philip thought over all that the headmaster had said, and\r\npresently, his mind taken up entirely with the ceremony that was before\r\nhim, a mystical rapture seized him. His spirit seemed to free itself\r\nfrom the bonds of the flesh and he seemed to be living a new life. He\r\naspired to perfection with all the passion that was in him. He wanted\r\nto surrender himself entirely to the service of God, and he made up his\r\nmind definitely that he would be ordained. When the great day arrived,\r\nhis soul deeply moved by all the preparation, by the books he had\r\nstudied and above all by the overwhelming influence of the head, he\r\ncould hardly contain himself for fear and joy. One thought had\r\ntormented him. He knew that he would have to walk alone through the\r\nchancel, and he dreaded showing his limp thus obviously, not only to\r\nthe whole school, who were attending the service, but also to the\r\nstrangers, people from the city or parents who had come to see their\r\nsons confirmed. But when the time came he felt suddenly that he could\r\naccept the humiliation joyfully; and as he limped up the chancel, very\r\nsmall and insignificant beneath the lofty vaulting of the Cathedral, he\r\noffered consciously his deformity as a sacrifice to the God who loved\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Philip could not live long in the rarefied air of the hilltops.\r\nWhat had happened to him when first he was seized by the religious\r\nemotion happened to him now. Because he felt so keenly the beauty of\r\nfaith, because the desire for self-sacrifice burned in his heart with\r\nsuch a gem-like glow, his strength seemed inadequate to his ambition.\r\nHe was tired out by the violence of his passion. His soul was filled on\r\na sudden with a singular aridity. He began to forget the presence of\r\nGod which had seemed so surrounding; and his religious exercises, still\r\nvery punctually performed, grew merely formal. At first he blamed\r\nhimself for this falling away, and the fear of hell-fire urged him to\r\nrenewed vehemence; but the passion was dead, and gradually other\r\ninterests distracted his thoughts.\r\n\r\nPhilip had few friends. His habit of reading isolated him: it became\r\nsuch a need that after being in company for some time he grew tired and\r\nrestless; he was vain of the wider knowledge he had acquired from the\r\nperusal of so many books, his mind was alert, and he had not the skill\r\nto hide his contempt for his companions\xe2\x80\x99 stupidity. They complained\r\nthat he was conceited; and, since he excelled only in matters which to\r\nthem were unimportant, they asked satirically what he had to be\r\nconceited about. He was developing a sense of humour, and found that he\r\nhad a knack of saying bitter things, which caught people on the raw; he\r\nsaid them because they amused him, hardly realising how much they hurt,\r\nand was much offended when he found that his victims regarded him with\r\nactive dislike. The humiliations he suffered when first he went to\r\nschool had caused in him a shrinking from his fellows which he could\r\nnever entirely overcome; he remained shy and silent. But though he did\r\neverything to alienate the sympathy of other boys he longed with all\r\nhis heart for the popularity which to some was so easily accorded.\r\nThese from his distance he admired extravagantly; and though he was\r\ninclined to be more sarcastic with them than with others, though he\r\nmade little jokes at their expense, he would have given anything to\r\nchange places with them. Indeed he would gladly have changed places\r\nwith the dullest boy in the school who was whole of limb. He took to a\r\nsingular habit. He would imagine that he was some boy whom he had a\r\nparticular fancy for; he would throw his soul, as it were, into the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s body, talk with his voice and laugh with his heart; he would\r\nimagine himself doing all the things the other did. It was so vivid\r\nthat he seemed for a moment really to be no longer himself. In this way\r\nhe enjoyed many intervals of fantastic happiness.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Christmas term which followed on his\r\nconfirmation Philip found himself moved into another study. One of the\r\nboys who shared it was called Rose. He was in the same form as Philip,\r\nand Philip had always looked upon him with envious admiration. He was\r\nnot good-looking; though his large hands and big bones suggested that\r\nhe would be a tall man, he was clumsily made; but his eyes were\r\ncharming, and when he laughed (he was constantly laughing) his face\r\nwrinkled all round them in a jolly way. He was neither clever nor\r\nstupid, but good enough at his work and better at games. He was a\r\nfavourite with masters and boys, and he in his turn liked everyone.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip was put in the study he could not help seeing that the\r\nothers, who had been together for three terms, welcomed him coldly. It\r\nmade him nervous to feel himself an intruder; but he had learned to\r\nhide his feelings, and they found him quiet and unobtrusive. With Rose,\r\nbecause he was as little able as anyone else to resist his charm,\r\nPhilip was even more than usually shy and abrupt; and whether on\r\naccount of this, unconsciously bent upon exerting the fascination he\r\nknew was his only by the results, or whether from sheer kindness of\r\nheart, it was Rose who first took Philip into the circle. One day,\r\nquite suddenly, he asked Philip if he would walk to the football field\r\nwith him. Philip flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t walk fast enough for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot. Come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd just before they were setting out some boy put his head in the\r\nstudy-door and asked Rose to go with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve already promised Carey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother about me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Philip with those good-natured eyes of his and laughed.\r\nPhilip felt a curious tremor in his heart.\r\n\r\nIn a little while, their friendship growing with boyish rapidity, the\r\npair were inseparable. Other fellows wondered at the sudden intimacy,\r\nand Rose was asked what he saw in Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not half a bad chap really.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon they grew accustomed to the two walking into chapel arm in arm or\r\nstrolling round the precincts in conversation; wherever one was the\r\nother could be found also, and, as though acknowledging his\r\nproprietorship, boys who wanted Rose would leave messages with Carey.\r\nPhilip at first was reserved. He would not let himself yield entirely\r\nto the proud joy that filled him; but presently his distrust of the\r\nfates gave way before a wild happiness. He thought Rose the most\r\nwonderful fellow he had ever seen. His books now were insignificant; he\r\ncould not bother about them when there was something infinitely more\r\nimportant to occupy him. Rose\xe2\x80\x99s friends used to come in to tea in the\r\nstudy sometimes or sit about when there was nothing better to do\xe2\x80\x94Rose\r\nliked a crowd and the chance of a rag\xe2\x80\x94and they found that Philip was\r\nquite a decent fellow. Philip was happy.\r\n\r\nWhen the last day of term came he and Rose arranged by which train they\r\nshould come back, so that they might meet at the station and have tea\r\nin the town before returning to school. Philip went home with a heavy\r\nheart. He thought of Rose all through the holidays, and his fancy was\r\nactive with the things they would do together next term. He was bored\r\nat the vicarage, and when on the last day his uncle put him the usual\r\nquestion in the usual facetious tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you glad to be going back to school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip answered joyfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn order to be sure of meeting Rose at the station he took an earlier\r\ntrain than he usually did, and he waited about the platform for an\r\nhour. When the train came in from Faversham, where he knew Rose had to\r\nchange, he ran along it excitedly. But Rose was not there. He got a\r\nporter to tell him when another train was due, and he waited; but again\r\nhe was disappointed; and he was cold and hungry, so he walked, through\r\nside-streets and slums, by a short cut to the school. He found Rose in\r\nthe study, with his feet on the chimney-piece, talking eighteen to the\r\ndozen with half a dozen boys who were sitting on whatever there was to\r\nsit on. He shook hands with Philip enthusiastically, but Philip\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nfell, for he realised that Rose had forgotten all about their\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, why are you so late?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were never\r\ncoming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were at the station at half-past four,\xe2\x80\x9d said another boy. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw\r\nyou when I came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip blushed a little. He did not want Rose to know that he had been\r\nsuch a fool as to wait for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to see about a friend of my people\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he invented readily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas asked to see her off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his disappointment made him a little sulky. He sat in silence, and\r\nwhen spoken to answered in monosyllables. He was making up his mind to\r\nhave it out with Rose when they were alone. But when the others had\r\ngone Rose at once came over and sat on the arm of the chair in which\r\nPhilip was lounging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m jolly glad we\xe2\x80\x99re in the same study this term. Ripping,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed so genuinely pleased to see Philip that Philip\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance\r\nvanished. They began as if they had not been separated for five minutes\r\nto talk eagerly of the thousand things that interested them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first Philip had been too grateful for Rose\xe2\x80\x99s friendship to make any\r\ndemands on him. He took things as they came and enjoyed life. But\r\npresently he began to resent Rose\xe2\x80\x99s universal amiability; he wanted a\r\nmore exclusive attachment, and he claimed as a right what before he had\r\naccepted as a favour. He watched jealously Rose\xe2\x80\x99s companionship with\r\nothers; and though he knew it was unreasonable could not help sometimes\r\nsaying bitter things to him. If Rose spent an hour playing the fool in\r\nanother study, Philip would receive him when he returned to his own\r\nwith a sullen frown. He would sulk for a day, and he suffered more\r\nbecause Rose either did not notice his ill-humour or deliberately\r\nignored it. Not seldom Philip, knowing all the time how stupid he was,\r\nwould force a quarrel, and they would not speak to one another for a\r\ncouple of days. But Philip could not bear to be angry with him long,\r\nand even when convinced that he was in the right, would apologise\r\nhumbly. Then for a week they would be as great friends as ever. But the\r\nbest was over, and Philip could see that Rose often walked with him\r\nmerely from old habit or from fear of his anger; they had not so much\r\nto say to one another as at first, and Rose was often bored. Philip\r\nfelt that his lameness began to irritate him.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the term two or three boys caught scarlet fever, and\r\nthere was much talk of sending them all home in order to escape an\r\nepidemic; but the sufferers were isolated, and since no more were\r\nattacked it was supposed that the outbreak was stopped. One of the\r\nstricken was Philip. He remained in hospital through the Easter\r\nholidays, and at the beginning of the summer term was sent home to the\r\nvicarage to get a little fresh air. The Vicar, notwithstanding medical\r\nassurance that the boy was no longer infectious, received him with\r\nsuspicion; he thought it very inconsiderate of the doctor to suggest\r\nthat his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s convalescence should be spent by the seaside, and\r\nconsented to have him in the house only because there was nowhere else\r\nhe could go.\r\n\r\nPhilip went back to school at half-term. He had forgotten the quarrels\r\nhe had had with Rose, but remembered only that he was his greatest\r\nfriend. He knew that he had been silly. He made up his mind to be more\r\nreasonable. During his illness Rose had sent him in a couple of little\r\nnotes, and he had ended each with the words: \xe2\x80\x9cHurry up and come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPhilip thought Rose must be looking forward as much to his return as he\r\nwas himself to seeing Rose.\r\n\r\nHe found that owing to the death from scarlet fever of one of the boys\r\nin the Sixth there had been some shifting in the studies and Rose was\r\nno longer in his. It was a bitter disappointment. But as soon as he\r\narrived he burst into Rose\xe2\x80\x99s study. Rose was sitting at his desk,\r\nworking with a boy called Hunter, and turned round crossly as Philip\r\ncame in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. And then, seeing Philip: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip stopped in embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come in and see how you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were just working.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHunter broke into the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you get back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive minutes ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat and looked at him as though he was disturbing them. They\r\nevidently expected him to go quickly. Philip reddened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be off. You might look in when you\xe2\x80\x99ve done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip closed the door behind him and limped back to his own study. He\r\nfelt frightfully hurt. Rose, far from seeming glad to see him, had\r\nlooked almost put out. They might never have been more than\r\nacquaintances. Though he waited in his study, not leaving it for a\r\nmoment in case just then Rose should come, his friend never appeared;\r\nand next morning when he went in to prayers he saw Rose and Hunter\r\nsinging along arm in arm. What he could not see for himself others told\r\nhim. He had forgotten that three months is a long time in a schoolboy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife, and though he had passed them in solitude Rose had lived in the\r\nworld. Hunter had stepped into the vacant place. Philip found that Rose\r\nwas quietly avoiding him. But he was not the boy to accept a situation\r\nwithout putting it into words; he waited till he was sure Rose was\r\nalone in his study and went in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nRose looked at him with an embarrassment that made him angry with\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, why have you been so rotten since I came back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be an ass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you see in Hunter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked down. He could not bring himself to say what was in his\r\nheart. He was afraid of humiliating himself. Rose got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to the Gym,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nWhen he was at the door Philip forced himself to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Rose, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a perfect beast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go to hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose slammed the door behind him and left Philip alone. Philip shivered\r\nwith rage. He went back to his study and turned the conversation over\r\nin his mind. He hated Rose now, he wanted to hurt him, he thought of\r\nbiting things he might have said to him. He brooded over the end to\r\ntheir friendship and fancied that others were talking of it. In his\r\nsensitiveness he saw sneers and wonderings in other fellows\xe2\x80\x99 manner\r\nwhen they were not bothering their heads with him at all. He imagined\r\nto himself what they were saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to last long. I wonder he ever stuck Carey\r\nat all. Blighter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo show his indifference he struck up a violent friendship with a boy\r\ncalled Sharp whom he hated and despised. He was a London boy, with a\r\nloutish air, a heavy fellow with the beginnings of a moustache on his\r\nlip and bushy eyebrows that joined one another across the bridge of his\r\nnose. He had soft hands and manners too suave for his years. He spoke\r\nwith the suspicion of a cockney accent. He was one of those boys who\r\nare too slack to play games, and he exercised great ingenuity in making\r\nexcuses to avoid such as were compulsory. He was regarded by boys and\r\nmasters with a vague dislike, and it was from arrogance that Philip now\r\nsought his society. Sharp in a couple of terms was going to Germany for\r\na year. He hated school, which he looked upon as an indignity to be\r\nendured till he was old enough to go out into the world. London was all\r\nhe cared for, and he had many stories to tell of his doings there\r\nduring the holidays. From his conversation\xe2\x80\x94he spoke in a soft,\r\ndeep-toned voice\xe2\x80\x94there emerged the vague rumour of the London streets\r\nby night. Philip listened to him at once fascinated and repelled. With\r\nhis vivid fancy he seemed to see the surging throng round the pit-door\r\nof theatres, and the glitter of cheap restaurants, bars where men, half\r\ndrunk, sat on high stools talking with barmaids; and under the street\r\nlamps the mysterious passing of dark crowds bent upon pleasure. Sharp\r\nlent him cheap novels from Holywell Row, which Philip read in his\r\ncubicle with a sort of wonderful fear.\r\n\r\nOnce Rose tried to effect a reconciliation. He was a good-natured\r\nfellow, who did not like having enemies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Carey, why are you being such a silly ass? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do you\r\nany good cutting me and all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bore me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose shrugged his shoulders and left him. Philip was very white, as he\r\nalways became when he was moved, and his heart beat violently. When\r\nRose went away he felt suddenly sick with misery. He did not know why\r\nhe had answered in that fashion. He would have given anything to be\r\nfriends with Rose. He hated to have quarrelled with him, and now that\r\nhe saw he had given him pain he was very sorry. But at the moment he\r\nhad not been master of himself. It seemed that some devil had seized\r\nhim, forcing him to say bitter things against his will, even though at\r\nthe time he wanted to shake hands with Rose and meet him more than\r\nhalfway. The desire to wound had been too strong for him. He had wanted\r\nto revenge himself for the pain and the humiliation he had endured. It\r\nwas pride: it was folly too, for he knew that Rose would not care at\r\nall, while he would suffer bitterly. The thought came to him that he\r\nwould go to Rose, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I was such a beast. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make it\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he knew he would never be able to do it. He was afraid that Rose\r\nwould sneer at him. He was angry with himself, and when Sharp came in a\r\nlittle while afterwards he seized upon the first opportunity to quarrel\r\nwith him. Philip had a fiendish instinct for discovering other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nraw spots, and was able to say things that rankled because they were\r\ntrue. But Sharp had the last word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard Rose talking about you to Mellor just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMellor\r\nsaid: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you kick him? It would teach him manners. And Rose\r\nsaid: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to. Damned cripple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip suddenly became scarlet. He could not answer, for there was a\r\nlump in his throat that almost choked him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip was moved into the Sixth, but he hated school now with all his\r\nheart, and, having lost his ambition, cared nothing whether he did ill\r\nor well. He awoke in the morning with a sinking heart because he must\r\ngo through another day of drudgery. He was tired of having to do things\r\nbecause he was told; and the restrictions irked him, not because they\r\nwere unreasonable, but because they were restrictions. He yearned for\r\nfreedom. He was weary of repeating things that he knew already and of\r\nthe hammering away, for the sake of a thick-witted fellow, at something\r\nthat he understood from the beginning.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Perkins you could work or not as you chose. He was at once\r\neager and abstracted. The Sixth Form room was in a part of the old\r\nabbey which had been restored, and it had a gothic window: Philip tried\r\nto cheat his boredom by drawing this over and over again; and sometimes\r\nout of his head he drew the great tower of the Cathedral or the gateway\r\nthat led into the precincts. He had a knack for drawing. Aunt Louisa\r\nduring her youth had painted in water colours, and she had several\r\nalbums filled with sketches of churches, old bridges, and picturesque\r\ncottages. They were often shown at the vicarage tea-parties. She had\r\nonce given Philip a paint-box as a Christmas present, and he had\r\nstarted by copying her pictures. He copied them better than anyone\r\ncould have expected, and presently he did little pictures of his own.\r\nMrs. Carey encouraged him. It was a good way to keep him out of\r\nmischief, and later on his sketches would be useful for bazaars. Two or\r\nthree of them had been framed and hung in his bed-room.\r\n\r\nBut one day, at the end of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s work, Mr. Perkins stopped him\r\nas he was lounging out of the form-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you, Carey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip waited. Mr. Perkins ran his lean fingers through his beard and\r\nlooked at Philip. He seemed to be thinking over what he wanted to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you, Carey?\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly.\r\n\r\nPhilip, flushing, looked at him quickly. But knowing him well by now,\r\nwithout answering, he waited for him to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been dissatisfied with you lately. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been slack and\r\ninattentive. You seem to take no interest in your work. It\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nslovenly and bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all you have to say for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked down sulkily. How could he answer that he was bored to\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, this term you\xe2\x80\x99ll go down instead of up. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t give you a\r\nvery good report.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip wondered what he would say if he knew how the report was\r\ntreated. It arrived at breakfast, Mr. Carey glanced at it\r\nindifferently, and passed it over to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your report. You\xe2\x80\x99d better see what it says,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, as\r\nhe ran his fingers through the wrapper of a catalogue of second-hand\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nPhilip read it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it good?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aunt Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so good as I deserve,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip, with a smile, giving it to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll read it afterwards when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my spectacles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nBut after breakfast Mary Ann came in to say the butcher was there, and\r\nshe generally forgot.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed with you. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I know you can do\r\nthings if you want to, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want to any more. I was\r\ngoing to make you a monitor next term, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99d better wait a\r\nbit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip flushed. He did not like the thought of being passed over. He\r\ntightened his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s something else. You must begin thinking of your\r\nscholarship now. You won\xe2\x80\x99t get anything unless you start working very\r\nseriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was irritated by the lecture. He was angry with the headmaster,\r\nand angry with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going up to Oxford,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I thought your idea was to be ordained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not answer. Mr. Perkins, holding himself oddly as he always\r\ndid, like a figure in one of Perugino\xe2\x80\x99s pictures, drew his fingers\r\nthoughtfully through his beard. He looked at Philip as though he were\r\ntrying to understand and then abruptly told him he might go.\r\n\r\nApparently he was not satisfied, for one evening, a week later, when\r\nPhilip had to go into his study with some papers, he resumed the\r\nconversation; but this time he adopted a different method: he spoke to\r\nPhilip not as a schoolmaster with a boy but as one human being with\r\nanother. He did not seem to care now that Philip\xe2\x80\x99s work was poor, that\r\nhe ran small chance against keen rivals of carrying off the scholarship\r\nnecessary for him to go to Oxford: the important matter was his changed\r\nintention about his life afterwards. Mr. Perkins set himself to revive\r\nhis eagerness to be ordained. With infinite skill he worked on his\r\nfeelings, and this was easier since he was himself genuinely moved.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s change of mind caused him bitter distress, and he really\r\nthought he was throwing away his chance of happiness in life for he\r\nknew not what. His voice was very persuasive. And Philip, easily moved\r\nby the emotion of others, very emotional himself notwithstanding a\r\nplacid exterior\xe2\x80\x94his face, partly by nature but also from the habit of\r\nall these years at school, seldom except by his quick flushing showed\r\nwhat he felt\xe2\x80\x94Philip was deeply touched by what the master said. He was\r\nvery grateful to him for the interest he showed, and he was\r\nconscience-stricken by the grief which he felt his behaviour caused\r\nhim. It was subtly flattering to know that with the whole school to\r\nthink about Mr. Perkins should trouble with him, but at the same time\r\nsomething else in him, like another person standing at his elbow, clung\r\ndesperately to two words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t. I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt himself slipping. He was powerless against the weakness that\r\nseemed to well up in him; it was like the water that rises up in an\r\nempty bottle held over a full basin; and he set his teeth, saying the\r\nwords over and over to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t. I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Perkins put his hand on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to influence you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must decide for\r\nyourself. Pray to Almighty God for help and guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Philip came out of the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s house there was a light rain\r\nfalling. He went under the archway that led to the precincts, there was\r\nnot a soul there, and the rooks were silent in the elms. He walked\r\nround slowly. He felt hot, and the rain did him good. He thought over\r\nall that Mr. Perkins had said, calmly now that he was withdrawn from\r\nthe fervour of his personality, and he was thankful he had not given\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness he could but vaguely see the great mass of the\r\nCathedral: he hated it now because of the irksomeness of the long\r\nservices which he was forced to attend. The anthem was interminable,\r\nand you had to stand drearily while it was being sung; you could not\r\nhear the droning sermon, and your body twitched because you had to sit\r\nstill when you wanted to move about. Then Philip thought of the two\r\nservices every Sunday at Blackstable. The church was bare and cold, and\r\nthere was a smell all about one of pomade and starched clothes. The\r\ncurate preached once and his uncle preached once. As he grew up he had\r\nlearned to know his uncle; Philip was downright and intolerant, and he\r\ncould not understand that a man might sincerely say things as a\r\nclergyman which he never acted up to as a man. The deception outraged\r\nhim. His uncle was a weak and selfish man, whose chief desire it was to\r\nbe saved trouble.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins had spoken to him of the beauty of a life dedicated to the\r\nservice of God. Philip knew what sort of lives the clergy led in the\r\ncorner of East Anglia which was his home. There was the Vicar of\r\nWhitestone, a parish a little way from Blackstable: he was a bachelor\r\nand to give himself something to do had lately taken up farming: the\r\nlocal paper constantly reported the cases he had in the county court\r\nagainst this one and that, labourers he would not pay their wages to or\r\ntradesmen whom he accused of cheating him; scandal said he starved his\r\ncows, and there was much talk about some general action which should be\r\ntaken against him. Then there was the Vicar of Ferne, a bearded, fine\r\nfigure of a man: his wife had been forced to leave him because of his\r\ncruelty, and she had filled the neighbourhood with stories of his\r\nimmorality. The Vicar of Surle, a tiny hamlet by the sea, was to be\r\nseen every evening in the public house a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw from his\r\nvicarage; and the churchwardens had been to Mr. Carey to ask his\r\nadvice. There was not a soul for any of them to talk to except small\r\nfarmers or fishermen; there were long winter evenings when the wind\r\nblew, whistling drearily through the leafless trees, and all around\r\nthey saw nothing but the bare monotony of ploughed fields; and there\r\nwas poverty, and there was lack of any work that seemed to matter;\r\nevery kink in their characters had free play; there was nothing to\r\nrestrain them; they grew narrow and eccentric: Philip knew all this,\r\nbut in his young intolerance he did not offer it as an excuse. He\r\nshivered at the thought of leading such a life; he wanted to get out\r\ninto the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins soon saw that his words had had no effect on Philip, and\r\nfor the rest of the term ignored him. He wrote a report which was\r\nvitriolic. When it arrived and Aunt Louisa asked Philip what it was\r\nlike, he answered cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar. \xe2\x80\x9cI must look at it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any use in my staying on at Tercanbury? I should\r\nhave thought it would be better if I went to Germany for a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has put that in your head?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s rather a good idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSharp had already left King\xe2\x80\x99s School and had written to Philip from\r\nHanover. He was really starting life, and it made Philip more restless\r\nto think of it. He felt he could not bear another year of restraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a scholarship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a chance of getting one anyhow. And besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat I particularly want to go to Oxford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be ordained, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d Aunt Louisa exclaimed in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve given up that idea long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey looked at him with startled eyes, and then, used to\r\nself-restraint, she poured out another cup of tea for his uncle. They\r\ndid not speak. In a moment Philip saw tears slowly falling down her\r\ncheeks. His heart was suddenly wrung because he caused her pain. In her\r\ntight black dress, made by the dressmaker down the street, with her\r\nwrinkled face and pale tired eyes, her gray hair still done in the\r\nfrivolous ringlets of her youth, she was a ridiculous but strangely\r\npathetic figure. Philip saw it for the first time.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when the Vicar was shut up in his study with the curate, he\r\nput his arms round her waist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re upset, Aunt Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ngood my being ordained if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a real vocation, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so disappointed, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d set my heart on it. I\r\nthought you could be your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s curate, and then when our time\r\ncame\xe2\x80\x94after all, we can\xe2\x80\x99t last for ever, can we?\xe2\x80\x94you might have taken\r\nhis place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip shivered. He was seized with panic. His heart beat like a pigeon\r\nin a trap beating with its wings. His aunt wept softly, her head upon\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d persuade Uncle William to let me leave Tercanbury. I\xe2\x80\x99m so\r\nsick of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Vicar of Blackstable did not easily alter any arrangements he\r\nhad made, and it had always been intended that Philip should stay at\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s School till he was eighteen, and should then go to Oxford. At\r\nall events he would not hear of Philip leaving then, for no notice had\r\nbeen given and the term\xe2\x80\x99s fee would have to be paid in any case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen will you give notice for me to leave at Christmas?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip,\r\nat the end of a long and often bitter conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write to Mr. Perkins about it and see what he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wish to goodness I were twenty-one. It is awful to be at\r\nsomebody else\xe2\x80\x99s beck and call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to your uncle like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Carey\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that Perkins will want me to stay? He gets so much a\r\nhead for every chap in the school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to go to Oxford?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good if I\xe2\x80\x99m not going into the Church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t go into the Church: you\xe2\x80\x99re in the Church already,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nVicar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrdained then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Philip impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to be, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Carey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not made up my mind. But whatever I am, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nuseful to know foreign languages. I shall get far more out of a year in\r\nGermany than by staying on at that hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would not say that he felt Oxford would be little better than a\r\ncontinuation of his life at school. He wished immensely to be his own\r\nmaster. Besides he would be known to a certain extent among old\r\nschoolfellows, and he wanted to get away from them all. He felt that\r\nhis life at school had been a failure. He wanted to start fresh.\r\n\r\nIt happened that his desire to go to Germany fell in with certain ideas\r\nwhich had been of late discussed at Blackstable. Sometimes friends came\r\nto stay with the doctor and brought news of the world outside; and the\r\nvisitors spending August by the sea had their own way of looking at\r\nthings. The Vicar had heard that there were people who did not think\r\nthe old-fashioned education so useful nowadays as it had been in the\r\npast, and modern languages were gaining an importance which they had\r\nnot had in his own youth. His own mind was divided, for a younger\r\nbrother of his had been sent to Germany when he failed in some\r\nexamination, thus creating a precedent but since he had there died of\r\ntyphoid it was impossible to look upon the experiment as other than\r\ndangerous. The result of innumerable conversations was that Philip\r\nshould go back to Tercanbury for another term, and then should leave.\r\nWith this agreement Philip was not dissatisfied. But when he had been\r\nback a few days the headmaster spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a letter from your uncle. It appears you want to go to\r\nGermany, and he asks me what I think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was astounded. He was furious with his guardian for going back\r\non his word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was settled, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve written to say I think it the greatest mistake to\r\ntake you away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip immediately sat down and wrote a violent letter to his uncle. He\r\ndid not measure his language. He was so angry that he could not get to\r\nsleep till quite late that night, and he awoke in the early morning and\r\nbegan brooding over the way they had treated him. He waited impatiently\r\nfor an answer. In two or three days it came. It was a mild, pained\r\nletter from Aunt Louisa, saying that he should not write such things to\r\nhis uncle, who was very much distressed. He was unkind and unchristian.\r\nHe must know they were only trying to do their best for him, and they\r\nwere so much older than he that they must be better judges of what was\r\ngood for him. Philip clenched his hands. He had heard that statement so\r\noften, and he could not see why it was true; they did not know the\r\nconditions as he did, why should they accept it as self-evident that\r\ntheir greater age gave them greater wisdom? The letter ended with the\r\ninformation that Mr. Carey had withdrawn the notice he had given.\r\n\r\nPhilip nursed his wrath till the next half-holiday. They had them on\r\nTuesdays and Thursdays, since on Saturday afternoons they had to go to\r\na service in the Cathedral. He stopped behind when the rest of the\r\nSixth went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I go to Blackstable this afternoon, please, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the headmaster briefly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see my uncle about something very important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear me say no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not answer. He went out. He felt almost sick with\r\nhumiliation, the humiliation of having to ask and the humiliation of\r\nthe curt refusal. He hated the headmaster now. Philip writhed under\r\nthat despotism which never vouchsafed a reason for the most tyrannous\r\nact. He was too angry to care what he did, and after dinner walked down\r\nto the station, by the back ways he knew so well, just in time to catch\r\nthe train to Blackstable. He walked into the vicarage and found his\r\nuncle and aunt sitting in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa, where have you sprung from?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar.\r\n\r\nIt was very clear that he was not pleased to see him. He looked a\r\nlittle uneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come and see you about my leaving. I want to know what\r\nyou mean by promising me one thing when I was here, and doing something\r\ndifferent a week after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a little frightened at his own boldness, but he had made up his\r\nmind exactly what words to use, and, though his heart beat violently,\r\nhe forced himself to say them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got leave to come here this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I asked Perkins and he refused. If you like to write and tell him\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been here you can get me into a really fine old row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey sat knitting with trembling hands. She was unused to scenes\r\nand they agitated her extremely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would serve you right if I told him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like to be a perfect sneak you can. After writing to Perkins as\r\nyou did you\xe2\x80\x99re quite capable of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was foolish of Philip to say that, because it gave the Vicar exactly\r\nthe opportunity he wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to sit still while you say impertinent things to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid with dignity.\r\n\r\nHe got up and walked quickly out of the room into his study. Philip\r\nheard him shut the door and lock it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wish to God I were twenty-one. It is awful to be tied down like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Louisa began to cry quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Philip, you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have spoken to your uncle like that. Do\r\nplease go and tell him you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not in the least sorry. He\xe2\x80\x99s taking a mean advantage. Of course\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just waste of money keeping me on at school, but what does he\r\ncare? It\xe2\x80\x99s not his money. It was cruel to put me under the guardianship\r\nof people who know nothing about things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip in his voluble anger stopped suddenly at the sound of her voice.\r\nIt was heart-broken. He had not realised what bitter things he was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, how can you be so unkind? You know we are only trying to do\r\nour best for you, and we know that we have no experience; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nif we\xe2\x80\x99d had any children of our own: that\xe2\x80\x99s why we consulted Mr.\r\nPerkins.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice broke. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be like a mother to you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nloved you as if you were my own son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so small and frail, there was something so pathetic in her\r\nold-maidish air, that Philip was touched. A great lump came suddenly in\r\nhis throat and his eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be beastly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knelt down beside her and took her in his arms, and kissed her wet,\r\nwithered cheeks. She sobbed bitterly, and he seemed to feel on a sudden\r\nthe pity of that wasted life. She had never surrendered herself before\r\nto such a display of emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been what I wanted to be to you, Philip, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how. It\xe2\x80\x99s been just as dreadful for me to have no children as for\r\nyou to have no mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip forgot his anger and his own concerns, but thought only of\r\nconsoling her, with broken words and clumsy little caresses. Then the\r\nclock struck, and he had to bolt off at once to catch the only train\r\nthat would get him back to Tercanbury in time for call-over. As he sat\r\nin the corner of the railway carriage he saw that he had done nothing.\r\nHe was angry with himself for his weakness. It was despicable to have\r\nallowed himself to be turned from his purpose by the pompous airs of\r\nthe Vicar and the tears of his aunt. But as the result of he knew not\r\nwhat conversations between the couple another letter was written to the\r\nheadmaster. Mr. Perkins read it with an impatient shrug of the\r\nshoulders. He showed it to Philip. It ran:\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Perkins,\r\n\r\nForgive me for troubling you again about my ward, but both his Aunt and\r\nI have been uneasy about him. He seems very anxious to leave school,\r\nand his Aunt thinks he is unhappy. It is very difficult for us to know\r\nwhat to do as we are not his parents. He does not seem to think he is\r\ndoing very well and he feels it is wasting his money to stay on. I\r\nshould be very much obliged if you would have a talk to him, and if he\r\nis still of the same mind perhaps it would be better if he left at\r\nChristmas as I originally intended.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n  William Carey.\r\n\r\nPhilip gave him back the letter. He felt a thrill of pride in his\r\ntriumph. He had got his own way, and he was satisfied. His will had\r\ngained a victory over the wills of others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not much good my spending half an hour writing to your uncle if\r\nhe changes his mind the next letter he gets from you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nheadmaster irritably.\r\n\r\nPhilip said nothing, and his face was perfectly placid; but he could\r\nnot prevent the twinkle in his eyes. Mr. Perkins noticed it and broke\r\ninto a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve rather scored, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThen Philip smiled outright. He could not conceal his exultation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true that you\xe2\x80\x99re very anxious to leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you unhappy here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip blushed. He hated instinctively any attempt to get into the\r\ndepths of his feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins, slowly dragging his fingers through his beard, looked at\r\nhim thoughtfully. He seemed to speak almost to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course schools are made for the average. The holes are all round,\r\nand whatever shape the pegs are they must wedge in somehow. One hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntime to bother about anything but the average.\xe2\x80\x9d Then suddenly he\r\naddressed himself to Philip: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a suggestion to make\r\nto you. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting on towards the end of the term now. Another term\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t kill you, and if you want to go to Germany you\xe2\x80\x99d better go after\r\nEaster than after Christmas. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be much pleasanter in the spring\r\nthan in midwinter. If at the end of the next term you still want to go\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make no objection. What d\xe2\x80\x99you say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was so glad to have gained the last three months that he did not\r\nmind the extra term. The school seemed less of a prison when he knew\r\nthat before Easter he would be free from it for ever. His heart danced\r\nwithin him. That evening in chapel he looked round at the boys,\r\nstanding according to their forms, each in his due place, and he\r\nchuckled with satisfaction at the thought that soon he would never see\r\nthem again. It made him regard them almost with a friendly feeling. His\r\neyes rested on Rose. Rose took his position as a monitor very\r\nseriously: he had quite an idea of being a good influence in the\r\nschool; it was his turn to read the lesson that evening, and he read it\r\nvery well. Philip smiled when he thought that he would be rid of him\r\nfor ever, and it would not matter in six months whether Rose was tall\r\nand straight-limbed; and where would the importance be that he was a\r\nmonitor and captain of the eleven? Philip looked at the masters in\r\ntheir gowns. Gordon was dead, he had died of apoplexy two years before,\r\nbut all the rest were there. Philip knew now what a poor lot they were,\r\nexcept Turner perhaps, there was something of a man in him; and he\r\nwrithed at the thought of the subjection in which they had held him. In\r\nsix months they would not matter either. Their praise would mean\r\nnothing to him, and he would shrug his shoulders at their censure.\r\n\r\nPhilip had learned not to express his emotions by outward signs, and\r\nshyness still tormented him, but he had often very high spirits; and\r\nthen, though he limped about demurely, silent and reserved, it seemed\r\nto be hallooing in his heart. He seemed to himself to walk more\r\nlightly. All sorts of ideas danced through his head, fancies chased one\r\nanother so furiously that he could not catch them; but their coming and\r\ntheir going filled him with exhilaration. Now, being happy, he was able\r\nto work, and during the remaining weeks of the term set himself to make\r\nup for his long neglect. His brain worked easily, and he took a keen\r\npleasure in the activity of his intellect. He did very well in the\r\nexaminations that closed the term. Mr. Perkins made only one remark: he\r\nwas talking to him about an essay he had written, and, after the usual\r\ncriticisms, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve made up your mind to stop playing the fool for a bit, have\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled at him with his shining teeth, and Philip, looking down, gave\r\nan embarrassed smile.\r\n\r\nThe half dozen boys who expected to divide between them the various\r\nprizes which were given at the end of the summer term had ceased to\r\nlook upon Philip as a serious rival, but now they began to regard him\r\nwith some uneasiness. He told no one that he was leaving at Easter and\r\nso was in no sense a competitor, but left them to their anxieties. He\r\nknew that Rose flattered himself on his French, for he had spent two or\r\nthree holidays in France; and he expected to get the Dean\xe2\x80\x99s Prize for\r\nEnglish essay; Philip got a good deal of satisfaction in watching his\r\ndismay when he saw how much better Philip was doing in these subjects\r\nthan himself. Another fellow, Norton, could not go to Oxford unless he\r\ngot one of the scholarships at the disposal of the school. He asked\r\nPhilip if he was going in for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\nIt entertained him to think that he held someone else\xe2\x80\x99s future in his\r\nhand. There was something romantic in getting these various rewards\r\nactually in his grasp, and then leaving them to others because he\r\ndisdained them. At last the breaking-up day came, and he went to Mr.\r\nPerkins to bid him good-bye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you really want to leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n Philip\xe2\x80\x99s face fell at the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s evident surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put any objection in the way, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was only a whim that I\xe2\x80\x99d better humour. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nobstinate and headstrong. What on earth d\xe2\x80\x99you want to leave for now?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only got another term in any case. You can get the Magdalen\r\nscholarship easily; you\xe2\x80\x99ll get half the prizes we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at him sullenly. He felt that he had been tricked; but he\r\nhad the promise, and Perkins would have to stand by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a very pleasant time at Oxford. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t decide at once\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do afterwards. I wonder if you realise how\r\ndelightful the life is up there for anyone who has brains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made all my arrangements now to go to Germany, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they arrangements that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be altered?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr.\r\nPerkins, with his quizzical smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very sorry to lose you.\r\nIn schools the rather stupid boys who work always do better than the\r\nclever boy who\xe2\x80\x99s idle, but when the clever boy works\xe2\x80\x94why then, he does\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ve done this term.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip flushed darkly. He was unused to compliments, and no one had\r\never told him he was clever. The headmaster put his hand on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, driving things into the heads of thick-witted boys is dull\r\nwork, but when now and then you have the chance of teaching a boy who\r\ncomes half-way towards you, who understands almost before you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nthe words out of your mouth, why, then teaching is the most\r\nexhilarating thing in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Philip was melted by kindness; it had\r\nnever occurred to him that it mattered really to Mr. Perkins whether he\r\nwent or stayed. He was touched and immensely flattered. It would be\r\npleasant to end up his school-days with glory and then go to Oxford: in\r\na flash there appeared before him the life which he had heard described\r\nfrom boys who came back to play in the O.K.S. match or in letters from\r\nthe University read out in one of the studies. But he was ashamed; he\r\nwould look such a fool in his own eyes if he gave in now; his uncle\r\nwould chuckle at the success of the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s ruse. It was rather a\r\ncome-down from the dramatic surrender of all these prizes which were in\r\nhis reach, because he disdained to take them, to the plain, ordinary\r\nwinning of them. It only required a little more persuasion, just enough\r\nto save his self-respect, and Philip would have done anything that Mr.\r\nPerkins wished; but his face showed nothing of his conflicting\r\nemotions. It was placid and sullen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins, like many men who manage things by their personal\r\ninfluence, grew a little impatient when his power was not immediately\r\nmanifest. He had a great deal of work to do, and could not waste more\r\ntime on a boy who seemed to him insanely obstinate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I promised to let you if you really wanted it, and I keep\r\nmy promise. When do you go to Germany?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat violently. The battle was won, and he did not know\r\nwhether he had not rather lost it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning of May, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must come and see us when you get back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand. If he had given him one more chance Philip would\r\nhave changed his mind, but he seemed to look upon the matter as\r\nsettled. Philip walked out of the house. His school-days were over, and\r\nhe was free; but the wild exultation to which he had looked forward at\r\nthat moment was not there. He walked round the precincts slowly, and a\r\nprofound depression seized him. He wished now that he had not been\r\nfoolish. He did not want to go, but he knew he could never bring\r\nhimself to go to the headmaster and tell him he would stay. That was a\r\nhumiliation he could never put upon himself. He wondered whether he had\r\ndone right. He was dissatisfied with himself and with all his\r\ncircumstances. He asked himself dully whether whenever you got your way\r\nyou wished afterwards that you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s uncle had an old friend, called Miss Wilkinson, who lived in\r\nBerlin. She was the daughter of a clergyman, and it was with her\r\nfather, the rector of a village in Lincolnshire, that Mr. Carey had\r\nspent his last curacy; on his death, forced to earn her living, she had\r\ntaken various situations as a governess in France and Germany. She had\r\nkept up a correspondence with Mrs. Carey, and two or three times had\r\nspent her holidays at Blackstable Vicarage, paying as was usual with\r\nthe Careys\xe2\x80\x99 unfrequent guests a small sum for her keep. When it became\r\nclear that it was less trouble to yield to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s wishes than to\r\nresist them, Mrs. Carey wrote to ask her for advice. Miss Wilkinson\r\nrecommended Heidelberg as an excellent place to learn German in and the\r\nhouse of Frau Professor Erlin as a comfortable home. Philip might live\r\nthere for thirty marks a week, and the Professor himself, a teacher at\r\nthe local high school, would instruct him.\r\n\r\nPhilip arrived in Heidelberg one morning in May. His things were put on\r\na barrow and he followed the porter out of the station. The sky was\r\nbright blue, and the trees in the avenue through which they passed were\r\nthick with leaves; there was something in the air fresh to Philip, and\r\nmingled with the timidity he felt at entering on a new life, among\r\nstrangers, was a great exhilaration. He was a little disconsolate that\r\nno one had come to meet him, and felt very shy when the porter left him\r\nat the front door of a big white house. An untidy lad let him in and\r\ntook him into a drawing-room. It was filled with a large suite covered\r\nin green velvet, and in the middle was a round table. On this in water\r\nstood a bouquet of flowers tightly packed together in a paper frill\r\nlike the bone of a mutton chop, and carefully spaced round it were\r\nbooks in leather bindings. There was a musty smell.\r\n\r\nPresently, with an odour of cooking, the Frau Professor came in, a\r\nshort, very stout woman with tightly dressed hair and a red face; she\r\nhad little eyes, sparkling like beads, and an effusive manner. She took\r\nboth Philip\xe2\x80\x99s hands and asked him about Miss Wilkinson, who had twice\r\nspent a few weeks with her. She spoke in German and in broken English.\r\nPhilip could not make her understand that he did not know Miss\r\nWilkinson. Then her two daughters appeared. They seemed hardly young to\r\nPhilip, but perhaps they were not more than twenty-five: the elder,\r\nThekla, was as short as her mother, with the same, rather shifty air,\r\nbut with a pretty face and abundant dark hair; Anna, her younger\r\nsister, was tall and plain, but since she had a pleasant smile Philip\r\nimmediately preferred her. After a few minutes of polite conversation\r\nthe Frau Professor took Philip to his room and left him. It was in a\r\nturret, looking over the tops of the trees in the Anlage; and the bed\r\nwas in an alcove, so that when you sat at the desk it had not the look\r\nof a bed-room at all. Philip unpacked his things and set out all his\r\nbooks. He was his own master at last.\r\n\r\nA bell summoned him to dinner at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and he found the Frau\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s guests assembled in the drawing-room. He was introduced to\r\nher husband, a tall man of middle age with a large fair head, turning\r\nnow to gray, and mild blue eyes. He spoke to Philip in correct, rather\r\narchaic English, having learned it from a study of the English\r\nclassics, not from conversation; and it was odd to hear him use words\r\ncolloquially which Philip had only met in the plays of Shakespeare.\r\nFrau Professor Erlin called her establishment a family and not a\r\npension; but it would have required the subtlety of a metaphysician to\r\nfind out exactly where the difference lay. When they sat down to dinner\r\nin a long dark apartment that led out of the drawing-room, Philip,\r\nfeeling very shy, saw that there were sixteen people. The Frau\r\nProfessor sat at one end and carved. The service was conducted, with a\r\ngreat clattering of plates, by the same clumsy lout who had opened the\r\ndoor for him; and though he was quick it happened that the first\r\npersons to be served had finished before the last had received their\r\nappointed portions. The Frau Professor insisted that nothing but German\r\nshould be spoken, so that Philip, even if his bashfulness had permitted\r\nhim to be talkative, was forced to hold his tongue. He looked at the\r\npeople among whom he was to live. By the Frau Professor sat several old\r\nladies, but Philip did not give them much of his attention. There were\r\ntwo young girls, both fair and one of them very pretty, whom Philip\r\nheard addressed as Fraulein Hedwig and Fraulein Cacilie. Fraulein\r\nCacilie had a long pig-tail hanging down her back. They sat side by\r\nside and chattered to one another, with smothered laughter: now and\r\nthen they glanced at Philip and one of them said something in an\r\nundertone; they both giggled, and Philip blushed awkwardly, feeling\r\nthat they were making fun of him. Near them sat a Chinaman, with a\r\nyellow face and an expansive smile, who was studying Western conditions\r\nat the University. He spoke so quickly, with a queer accent, that the\r\ngirls could not always understand him, and then they burst out\r\nlaughing. He laughed too, good-humouredly, and his almond eyes almost\r\nclosed as he did so. There were two or three American men, in black\r\ncoats, rather yellow and dry of skin: they were theological students;\r\nPhilip heard the twang of their New England accent through their bad\r\nGerman, and he glanced at them with suspicion; for he had been taught\r\nto look upon Americans as wild and desperate barbarians.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when they had sat for a little on the stiff green velvet\r\nchairs of the drawing-room, Fraulein Anna asked Philip if he would like\r\nto go for a walk with them.\r\n\r\nPhilip accepted the invitation. They were quite a party. There were the\r\ntwo daughters of the Frau Professor, the two other girls, one of the\r\nAmerican students, and Philip. Philip walked by the side of Anna and\r\nFraulein Hedwig. He was a little fluttered. He had never known any\r\ngirls. At Blackstable there were only the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 daughters and the\r\ngirls of the local tradesmen. He knew them by name and by sight, but he\r\nwas timid, and he thought they laughed at his deformity. He accepted\r\nwillingly the difference which the Vicar and Mrs. Carey put between\r\ntheir own exalted rank and that of the farmers. The doctor had two\r\ndaughters, but they were both much older than Philip and had been\r\nmarried to successive assistants while Philip was still a small boy. At\r\nschool there had been two or three girls of more boldness than modesty\r\nwhom some of the boys knew; and desperate stories, due in all\r\nprobability to the masculine imagination, were told of intrigues with\r\nthem; but Philip had always concealed under a lofty contempt the terror\r\nwith which they filled him. His imagination and the books he had read\r\nhad inspired in him a desire for the Byronic attitude; and he was torn\r\nbetween a morbid self-consciousness and a conviction that he owed it to\r\nhimself to be gallant. He felt now that he should be bright and\r\namusing, but his brain seemed empty and he could not for the life of\r\nhim think of anything to say. Fraulein Anna, the Frau Professor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, addressed herself to him frequently from a sense of duty, but\r\nthe other said little: she looked at him now and then with sparkling\r\neyes, and sometimes to his confusion laughed outright. Philip felt that\r\nshe thought him perfectly ridiculous. They walked along the side of a\r\nhill among pine-trees, and their pleasant odour caused Philip a keen\r\ndelight. The day was warm and cloudless. At last they came to an\r\neminence from which they saw the valley of the Rhine spread out before\r\nthem under the sun. It was a vast stretch of country, sparkling with\r\ngolden light, with cities in the distance; and through it meandered the\r\nsilver ribband of the river. Wide spaces are rare in the corner of Kent\r\nwhich Philip knew, the sea offers the only broad horizon, and the\r\nimmense distance he saw now gave him a peculiar, an indescribable\r\nthrill. He felt suddenly elated. Though he did not know it, it was the\r\nfirst time that he had experienced, quite undiluted with foreign\r\nemotions, the sense of beauty. They sat on a bench, the three of them,\r\nfor the others had gone on, and while the girls talked in rapid German,\r\nPhilip, indifferent to their proximity, feasted his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, I am happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself unconsciously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip thought occasionally of the King\xe2\x80\x99s School at Tercanbury, and\r\nlaughed to himself as he remembered what at some particular moment of\r\nthe day they were doing. Now and then he dreamed that he was there\r\nstill, and it gave him an extraordinary satisfaction, on awaking, to\r\nrealise that he was in his little room in the turret. From his bed he\r\ncould see the great cumulus clouds that hung in the blue sky. He\r\nrevelled in his freedom. He could go to bed when he chose and get up\r\nwhen the fancy took him. There was no one to order him about. It struck\r\nhim that he need not tell any more lies.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that Professor Erlin should teach him Latin and\r\nGerman; a Frenchman came every day to give him lessons in French; and\r\nthe Frau Professor had recommended for mathematics an Englishman who\r\nwas taking a philological degree at the university. This was a man\r\nnamed Wharton. Philip went to him every morning. He lived in one room\r\non the top floor of a shabby house. It was dirty and untidy, and it was\r\nfilled with a pungent odour made up of many different stinks. He was\r\ngenerally in bed when Philip arrived at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and he jumped out,\r\nput on a filthy dressing-gown and felt slippers, and, while he gave\r\ninstruction, ate his simple breakfast. He was a short man, stout from\r\nexcessive beer drinking, with a heavy moustache and long, unkempt hair.\r\nHe had been in Germany for five years and was become very Teutonic. He\r\nspoke with scorn of Cambridge where he had taken his degree and with\r\nhorror of the life which awaited him when, having taken his doctorate\r\nin Heidelberg, he must return to England and a pedagogic career. He\r\nadored the life of the German university with its happy freedom and its\r\njolly companionships. He was a member of a Burschenschaft, and promised\r\nto take Philip to a Kneipe. He was very poor and made no secret that\r\nthe lessons he was giving Philip meant the difference between meat for\r\nhis dinner and bread and cheese. Sometimes after a heavy night he had\r\nsuch a headache that he could not drink his coffee, and he gave his\r\nlesson with heaviness of spirit. For these occasions he kept a few\r\nbottles of beer under the bed, and one of these and a pipe would help\r\nhim to bear the burden of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hair of the dog that bit him,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say as he poured out the\r\nbeer, carefully so that the foam should not make him wait too long to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nThen he would talk to Philip of the university, the quarrels between\r\nrival corps, the duels, and the merits of this and that professor.\r\nPhilip learnt more of life from him than of mathematics. Sometimes\r\nWharton would sit back with a laugh and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not done anything today. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t pay me for the\r\nlesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nThis was something new and very interesting, and he felt that it was of\r\ngreater import than trigonometry, which he never could understand. It\r\nwas like a window on life that he had a chance of peeping through, and\r\nhe looked with a wildly beating heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you can keep your dirty money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wharton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how about your dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, with a smile, for he knew\r\nexactly how his master\xe2\x80\x99s finances stood.\r\n\r\nWharton had even asked him to pay him the two shillings which the\r\nlesson cost once a week rather than once a month, since it made things\r\nless complicated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind my dinner. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve dined off a\r\nbottle of beer, and my mind\xe2\x80\x99s never clearer than when I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dived under the bed (the sheets were gray with want of washing), and\r\nfished out another bottle. Philip, who was young and did not know the\r\ngood things of life, refused to share it with him, so he drank alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long are you going to stay here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wharton.\r\n\r\nBoth he and Philip had given up with relief the pretence of\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I suppose about a year. Then my people want me to go\r\nto Oxford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWharton gave a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders. It was a new\r\nexperience for Philip to learn that there were persons who did not look\r\nupon that seat of learning with awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you want to go there for? You\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a glorified schoolboy.\r\nWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you matriculate here? A year\xe2\x80\x99s no good. Spend five years\r\nhere. You know, there are two good things in life, freedom of thought\r\nand freedom of action. In France you get freedom of action: you can do\r\nwhat you like and nobody bothers, but you must think like everybody\r\nelse. In Germany you must do what everybody else does, but you may\r\nthink as you choose. They\xe2\x80\x99re both very good things. I personally prefer\r\nfreedom of thought. But in England you get neither: you\xe2\x80\x99re ground down\r\nby convention. You can\xe2\x80\x99t think as you like and you can\xe2\x80\x99t act as you\r\nlike. That\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s a democratic nation. I expect America\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned back cautiously, for the chair on which he sat had a ricketty\r\nleg, and it was disconcerting when a rhetorical flourish was\r\ninterrupted by a sudden fall to the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to go back to England this year, but if I can scrape together\r\nenough to keep body and soul on speaking terms I shall stay another\r\ntwelve months. But then I shall have to go. And I must leave all\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he waved his arm round the dirty garret, with its unmade bed, the\r\nclothes lying on the floor, a row of empty beer bottles against the\r\nwall, piles of unbound, ragged books in every corner\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor some\r\nprovincial university where I shall try and get a chair of philology.\r\nAnd I shall play tennis and go to tea-parties.\xe2\x80\x9d He interrupted himself\r\nand gave Philip, very neatly dressed, with a clean collar on and his\r\nhair well-brushed, a quizzical look. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, my God! I shall have to\r\nwash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened, feeling his own spruceness an intolerable reproach;\r\nfor of late he had begun to pay some attention to his toilet, and he\r\nhad come out from England with a pretty selection of ties.\r\n\r\nThe summer came upon the country like a conqueror. Each day was\r\nbeautiful. The sky had an arrogant blue which goaded the nerves like a\r\nspur. The green of the trees in the Anlage was violent and crude; and\r\nthe houses, when the sun caught them, had a dazzling white which\r\nstimulated till it hurt. Sometimes on his way back from Wharton Philip\r\nwould sit in the shade on one of the benches in the Anlage, enjoying\r\nthe coolness and watching the patterns of light which the sun, shining\r\nthrough the leaves, made on the ground. His soul danced with delight as\r\ngaily as the sunbeams. He revelled in those moments of idleness stolen\r\nfrom his work. Sometimes he sauntered through the streets of the old\r\ntown. He looked with awe at the students of the corps, their cheeks\r\ngashed and red, who swaggered about in their coloured caps. In the\r\nafternoons he wandered about the hills with the girls in the Frau\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s house, and sometimes they went up the river and had tea in\r\na leafy beer-garden. In the evenings they walked round and round the\r\nStadtgarten, listening to the band.\r\n\r\nPhilip soon learned the various interests of the household. Fraulein\r\nThekla, the professor\xe2\x80\x99s elder daughter, was engaged to a man in England\r\nwho had spent twelve months in the house to learn German, and their\r\nmarriage was to take place at the end of the year. But the young man\r\nwrote that his father, an india-rubber merchant who lived in Slough,\r\ndid not approve of the union, and Fraulein Thekla was often in tears.\r\nSometimes she and her mother might be seen, with stern eyes and\r\ndetermined mouths, looking over the letters of the reluctant lover.\r\nThekla painted in water colour, and occasionally she and Philip, with\r\nanother of the girls to keep them company, would go out and paint\r\nlittle pictures. The pretty Fraulein Hedwig had amorous troubles too.\r\nShe was the daughter of a merchant in Berlin and a dashing hussar had\r\nfallen in love with her, a von if you please: but his parents opposed a\r\nmarriage with a person of her condition, and she had been sent to\r\nHeidelberg to forget him. She could never, never do this, and\r\ncorresponded with him continually, and he was making every effort to\r\ninduce an exasperating father to change his mind. She told all this to\r\nPhilip with pretty sighs and becoming blushes, and showed him the\r\nphotograph of the gay lieutenant. Philip liked her best of all the\r\ngirls at the Frau Professor\xe2\x80\x99s, and on their walks always tried to get\r\nby her side. He blushed a great deal when the others chaffed him for\r\nhis obvious preference. He made the first declaration in his life to\r\nFraulein Hedwig, but unfortunately it was an accident, and it happened\r\nin this manner. In the evenings when they did not go out, the young\r\nwomen sang little songs in the green velvet drawing-room, while\r\nFraulein Anna, who always made herself useful, industriously\r\naccompanied. Fraulein Hedwig\xe2\x80\x99s favourite song was called Ich liebe\r\ndich, I love you; and one evening after she had sung this, when Philip\r\nwas standing with her on the balcony, looking at the stars, it occurred\r\nto him to make some remark about it. He began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIch liebe dich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis German was halting, and he looked about for the word he wanted. The\r\npause was infinitesimal, but before he could go on Fraulein Hedwig\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, Herr Carey, Sie mussen mir nicht du sagen\xe2\x80\x94you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me\r\nin the second person singular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt himself grow hot all over, for he would never have dared to\r\ndo anything so familiar, and he could think of nothing on earth to say.\r\nIt would be ungallant to explain that he was not making an observation,\r\nbut merely mentioning the title of a song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntschuldigen Sie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nShe smiled pleasantly, quietly took his hand and pressed it, then\r\nturned back into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nNext day he was so embarrassed that he could not speak to her, and in\r\nhis shyness did all that was possible to avoid her. When he was asked\r\nto go for the usual walk he refused because, he said, he had work to\r\ndo. But Fraulein Hedwig seized an opportunity to speak to him alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you behaving in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d she said kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nangry with you for what you said last night. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help it if you\r\nlove me. I\xe2\x80\x99m flattered. But although I\xe2\x80\x99m not exactly engaged to Hermann\r\nI can never love anyone else, and I look upon myself as his bride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip blushed again, but he put on quite the expression of a rejected\r\nlover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Erlin gave Philip a lesson every day. He made out a list of\r\nbooks which Philip was to read till he was ready for the final\r\nachievement of Faust, and meanwhile, ingeniously enough, started him on\r\na German translation of one of the plays by Shakespeare which Philip\r\nhad studied at school. It was the period in Germany of Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s highest\r\nfame. Notwithstanding his rather condescending attitude towards\r\npatriotism he had been adopted as the national poet, and seemed since\r\nthe war of seventy to be one of the most significant glories of\r\nnational unity. The enthusiastic seemed in the wildness of the\r\nWalpurgisnacht to hear the rattle of artillery at Gravelotte. But one\r\nmark of a writer\xe2\x80\x99s greatness is that different minds can find in him\r\ndifferent inspirations; and Professor Erlin, who hated the Prussians,\r\ngave his enthusiastic admiration to Goethe because his works, Olympian\r\nand sedate, offered the only refuge for a sane mind against the\r\nonslaughts of the present generation. There was a dramatist whose name\r\nof late had been much heard at Heidelberg, and the winter before one of\r\nhis plays had been given at the theatre amid the cheers of adherents\r\nand the hisses of decent people. Philip heard discussions about it at\r\nthe Frau Professor\xe2\x80\x99s long table, and at these Professor Erlin lost his\r\nwonted calm: he beat the table with his fist, and drowned all\r\nopposition with the roar of his fine deep voice. It was nonsense and\r\nobscene nonsense. He forced himself to sit the play out, but he did not\r\nknow whether he was more bored or nauseated. If that was what the\r\ntheatre was coming to, then it was high time the police stepped in and\r\nclosed the playhouses. He was no prude and could laugh as well as\r\nanyone at the witty immorality of a farce at the Palais Royal, but here\r\nwas nothing but filth. With an emphatic gesture he held his nose and\r\nwhistled through his teeth. It was the ruin of the family, the\r\nuprooting of morals, the destruction of Germany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAber, Adolf,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frau Professor from the other end of the table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalm yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his fist at her. He was the mildest of creatures and ventured\r\nupon no action of his life without consulting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Helene, I tell you this,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cI would sooner my daughters\r\nwere lying dead at my feet than see them listening to the garbage of\r\nthat shameless fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe play was The Doll\xe2\x80\x99s House and the author was Henrik Ibsen.\r\n\r\nProfessor Erlin classed him with Richard Wagner, but of him he spoke\r\nnot with anger but with good-humoured laughter. He was a charlatan but\r\na successful charlatan, and in that was always something for the comic\r\nspirit to rejoice in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerruckter Kerl! A madman!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe had seen Lohengrin and that passed muster. It was dull but no worse.\r\nBut Siegfried! When he mentioned it Professor Erlin leaned his head on\r\nhis hand and bellowed with laughter. Not a melody in it from beginning\r\nto end! He could imagine Richard Wagner sitting in his box and laughing\r\ntill his sides ached at the sight of all the people who were taking it\r\nseriously. It was the greatest hoax of the nineteenth century. He\r\nlifted his glass of beer to his lips, threw back his head, and drank\r\ntill the glass was empty. Then wiping his mouth with the back of his\r\nhand, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you young people that before the nineteenth century is out\r\nWagner will be as dead as mutton. Wagner! I would give all his works\r\nfor one opera by Donizetti.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oddest of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s masters was his teacher of French. Monsieur\r\nDucroz was a citizen of Geneva. He was a tall old man, with a sallow\r\nskin and hollow cheeks; his gray hair was thin and long. He wore shabby\r\nblack clothes, with holes at the elbows of his coat and frayed\r\ntrousers. His linen was very dirty. Philip had never seen him in a\r\nclean collar. He was a man of few words, who gave his lesson\r\nconscientiously but without enthusiasm, arriving as the clock struck\r\nand leaving on the minute. His charges were very small. He was\r\ntaciturn, and what Philip learnt about him he learnt from others: it\r\nappeared that he had fought with Garibaldi against the Pope, but had\r\nleft Italy in disgust when it was clear that all his efforts for\r\nfreedom, by which he meant the establishment of a republic, tended to\r\nno more than an exchange of yokes; he had been expelled from Geneva for\r\nit was not known what political offences. Philip looked upon him with\r\npuzzled surprise; for he was very unlike his idea of the revolutionary:\r\nhe spoke in a low voice and was extraordinarily polite; he never sat\r\ndown till he was asked to; and when on rare occasions he met Philip in\r\nthe street took off his hat with an elaborate gesture; he never\r\nlaughed, he never even smiled. A more complete imagination than\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s might have pictured a youth of splendid hope, for he must have\r\nbeen entering upon manhood in 1848 when kings, remembering their\r\nbrother of France, went about with an uneasy crick in their necks; and\r\nperhaps that passion for liberty which passed through Europe, sweeping\r\nbefore it what of absolutism and tyranny had reared its head during the\r\nreaction from the revolution of 1789, filled no breast with a hotter\r\nfire. One might fancy him, passionate with theories of human equality\r\nand human rights, discussing, arguing, fighting behind barricades in\r\nParis, flying before the Austrian cavalry in Milan, imprisoned here,\r\nexiled from there, hoping on and upborne ever with the word which\r\nseemed so magical, the word Liberty; till at last, broken with disease\r\nand starvation, old, without means to keep body and soul together but\r\nsuch lessons as he could pick up from poor students, he found himself\r\nin that little neat town under the heel of a personal tyranny greater\r\nthan any in Europe. Perhaps his taciturnity hid a contempt for the\r\nhuman race which had abandoned the great dreams of his youth and now\r\nwallowed in sluggish ease; or perhaps these thirty years of revolution\r\nhad taught him that men are unfit for liberty, and he thought that he\r\nhad spent his life in the pursuit of that which was not worth the\r\nfinding. Or maybe he was tired out and waited only with indifference\r\nfor the release of death.\r\n\r\nOne day Philip, with the bluntness of his age, asked him if it was true\r\nhe had been with Garibaldi. The old man did not seem to attach any\r\nimportance to the question. He answered quite quietly in as low a voice\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say you were in the Commune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they? Shall we get on with our work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held the book open and Philip, intimidated, began to translate the\r\npassage he had prepared.\r\n\r\nOne day Monsieur Ducroz seemed to be in great pain. He had been\r\nscarcely able to drag himself up the many stairs to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s room: and\r\nwhen he arrived sat down heavily, his sallow face drawn, with beads of\r\nsweat on his forehead, trying to recover himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re ill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Philip saw that he was suffering, and at the end of the hour asked\r\nwhether he would not prefer to give no more lessons till he was better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, in his even low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer to go on while\r\nI am able.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, morbidly nervous when he had to make any reference to money,\r\nreddened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it won\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for the\r\nlessons just the same. If you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind I\xe2\x80\x99d like to give you the\r\nmoney for next week in advance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Ducroz charged eighteen pence an hour. Philip took a ten-mark\r\npiece out of his pocket and shyly put it on the table. He could not\r\nbring himself to offer it as if the old man were a beggar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case I think I won\xe2\x80\x99t come again till I\xe2\x80\x99m better.\xe2\x80\x9d He took the\r\ncoin and, without anything more than the elaborate bow with which he\r\nalways took his leave, went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonjour, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was vaguely disappointed. Thinking he had done a generous thing,\r\nhe had expected that Monsieur Ducroz would overwhelm him with\r\nexpressions of gratitude. He was taken aback to find that the old\r\nteacher accepted the present as though it were his due. He was so\r\nyoung, he did not realise how much less is the sense of obligation in\r\nthose who receive favours than in those who grant them. Monsieur Ducroz\r\nappeared again five or six days later. He tottered a little more and\r\nwas very weak, but seemed to have overcome the severity of the attack.\r\nHe was no more communicative than he had been before. He remained\r\nmysterious, aloof, and dirty. He made no reference to his illness till\r\nafter the lesson: and then, just as he was leaving, at the door, which\r\nhe held open, he paused. He hesitated, as though to speak were\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the money you gave me I should have starved. It\r\nwas all I had to live on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made his solemn, obsequious bow, and went out. Philip felt a little\r\nlump in his throat. He seemed to realise in a fashion the hopeless\r\nbitterness of the old man\xe2\x80\x99s struggle, and how hard life was for him\r\nwhen to himself it was so pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip had spent three months in Heidelberg when one morning the Frau\r\nProfessor told him that an Englishman named Hayward was coming to stay\r\nin the house, and the same evening at supper he saw a new face. For\r\nsome days the family had lived in a state of excitement. First, as the\r\nresult of heaven knows what scheming, by dint of humble prayers and\r\nveiled threats, the parents of the young Englishman to whom Fraulein\r\nThekla was engaged had invited her to visit them in England, and she\r\nhad set off with an album of water colours to show how accomplished she\r\nwas and a bundle of letters to prove how deeply the young man had\r\ncompromised himself. A week later Fraulein Hedwig with radiant smiles\r\nannounced that the lieutenant of her affections was coming to\r\nHeidelberg with his father and mother. Exhausted by the importunity of\r\ntheir son and touched by the dowry which Fraulein Hedwig\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\noffered, the lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s parents had consented to pass through\r\nHeidelberg to make the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance. The interview was\r\nsatisfactory and Fraulein Hedwig had the satisfaction of showing her\r\nlover in the Stadtgarten to the whole of Frau Professor Erlin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold. The silent old ladies who sat at the top of the table near\r\nthe Frau Professor were in a flutter, and when Fraulein Hedwig said she\r\nwas to go home at once for the formal engagement to take place, the\r\nFrau Professor, regardless of expense, said she would give a Maibowle.\r\nProfessor Erlin prided himself on his skill in preparing this mild\r\nintoxicant, and after supper the large bowl of hock and soda, with\r\nscented herbs floating in it and wild strawberries, was placed with\r\nsolemnity on the round table in the drawing-room. Fraulein Anna teased\r\nPhilip about the departure of his lady-love, and he felt very\r\nuncomfortable and rather melancholy. Fraulein Hedwig sang several\r\nsongs, Fraulein Anna played the Wedding March, and the Professor sang\r\nDie Wacht am Rhein. Amid all this jollification Philip paid little\r\nattention to the new arrival. They had sat opposite one another at\r\nsupper, but Philip was chattering busily with Fraulein Hedwig, and the\r\nstranger, knowing no German, had eaten his food in silence. Philip,\r\nobserving that he wore a pale blue tie, had on that account taken a\r\nsudden dislike to him. He was a man of twenty-six, very fair, with\r\nlong, wavy hair through which he passed his hand frequently with a\r\ncareless gesture. His eyes were large and blue, but the blue was very\r\npale, and they looked rather tired already. He was clean-shaven, and\r\nhis mouth, notwithstanding its thin lips, was well-shaped. Fraulein\r\nAnna took an interest in physiognomy, and she made Philip notice\r\nafterwards how finely shaped was his skull, and how weak was the lower\r\npart of his face. The head, she remarked, was the head of a thinker,\r\nbut the jaw lacked character. Fraulein Anna, foredoomed to a spinster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife, with her high cheek-bones and large misshapen nose, laid great\r\nstress upon character. While they talked of him he stood a little apart\r\nfrom the others, watching the noisy party with a good-humoured but\r\nfaintly supercilious expression. He was tall and slim. He held himself\r\nwith a deliberate grace. Weeks, one of the American students, seeing\r\nhim alone, went up and began to talk to him. The pair were oddly\r\ncontrasted: the American very neat in his black coat and\r\npepper-and-salt trousers, thin and dried-up, with something of\r\necclesiastical unction already in his manner; and the Englishman in his\r\nloose tweed suit, large-limbed and slow of gesture.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not speak to the newcomer till next day. They found\r\nthemselves alone on the balcony of the drawing-room before dinner.\r\nHayward addressed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re English, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the food always as bad it was last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always about the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeastly, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeastly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had found nothing wrong with the food at all, and in fact had\r\neaten it in large quantities with appetite and enjoyment, but he did\r\nnot want to show himself a person of so little discrimination as to\r\nthink a dinner good which another thought execrable.\r\n\r\nFraulein Thekla\xe2\x80\x99s visit to England made it necessary for her sister to\r\ndo more in the house, and she could not often spare the time for long\r\nwalks; and Fraulein Cacilie, with her long plait of fair hair and her\r\nlittle snub-nosed face, had of late shown a certain disinclination for\r\nsociety. Fraulein Hedwig was gone, and Weeks, the American who\r\ngenerally accompanied them on their rambles, had set out for a tour of\r\nSouth Germany. Philip was left a good deal to himself. Hayward sought\r\nhis acquaintance; but Philip had an unfortunate trait: from shyness or\r\nfrom some atavistic inheritance of the cave-dweller, he always disliked\r\npeople on first acquaintance; and it was not till he became used to\r\nthem that he got over his first impression. It made him difficult of\r\naccess. He received Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s advances very shyly, and when Hayward\r\nasked him one day to go for a walk he accepted only because he could\r\nnot think of a civil excuse. He made his usual apology, angry with\r\nhimself for the flushing cheeks he could not control, and trying to\r\ncarry it off with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t walk very fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, I don\xe2\x80\x99t walk for a wager. I prefer to stroll. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremember the chapter in Marius where Pater talks of the gentle exercise\r\nof walking as the best incentive to conversation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was a good listener; though he often thought of clever things to\r\nsay, it was seldom till after the opportunity to say them had passed;\r\nbut Hayward was communicative; anyone more experienced than Philip\r\nmight have thought he liked to hear himself talk. His supercilious\r\nattitude impressed Philip. He could not help admiring, and yet being\r\nawed by, a man who faintly despised so many things which Philip had\r\nlooked upon as almost sacred. He cast down the fetish of exercise,\r\ndamning with the contemptuous word pot-hunters all those who devoted\r\nthemselves to its various forms; and Philip did not realise that he was\r\nmerely putting up in its stead the other fetish of culture.\r\n\r\nThey wandered up to the castle, and sat on the terrace that overlooked\r\nthe town. It nestled in the valley along the pleasant Neckar with a\r\ncomfortable friendliness. The smoke from the chimneys hung over it, a\r\npale blue haze; and the tall roofs, the spires of the churches, gave it\r\na pleasantly medieval air. There was a homeliness in it which warmed\r\nthe heart. Hayward talked of Richard Feverel and Madame Bovary, of\r\nVerlaine, Dante, and Matthew Arnold. In those days Fitzgerald\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntranslation of Omar Khayyam was known only to the elect, and Hayward\r\nrepeated it to Philip. He was very fond of reciting poetry, his own and\r\nthat of others, which he did in a monotonous sing-song. By the time\r\nthey reached home Philip\xe2\x80\x99s distrust of Hayward was changed to\r\nenthusiastic admiration.\r\n\r\nThey made a practice of walking together every afternoon, and Philip\r\nlearned presently something of Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances. He was the son\r\nof a country judge, on whose death some time before he had inherited\r\nthree hundred a year. His record at Charterhouse was so brilliant that\r\nwhen he went to Cambridge the Master of Trinity Hall went out of his\r\nway to express his satisfaction that he was going to that college. He\r\nprepared himself for a distinguished career. He moved in the most\r\nintellectual circles: he read Browning with enthusiasm and turned up\r\nhis well-shaped nose at Tennyson; he knew all the details of Shelley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntreatment of Harriet; he dabbled in the history of art (on the walls of\r\nhis rooms were reproductions of pictures by G. F. Watts, Burne-Jones,\r\nand Botticelli); and he wrote not without distinction verses of a\r\npessimistic character. His friends told one another that he was a man\r\nof excellent gifts, and he listened to them willingly when they\r\nprophesied his future eminence. In course of time he became an\r\nauthority on art and literature. He came under the influence of\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s Apologia; the picturesqueness of the Roman Catholic faith\r\nappealed to his esthetic sensibility; and it was only the fear of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s wrath (a plain, blunt man of narrow ideas, who read Macaulay)\r\nwhich prevented him from \xe2\x80\x98going over.\xe2\x80\x99 When he only got a pass degree\r\nhis friends were astonished; but he shrugged his shoulders and\r\ndelicately insinuated that he was not the dupe of examiners. He made\r\none feel that a first class was ever so slightly vulgar. He described\r\none of the vivas with tolerant humour; some fellow in an outrageous\r\ncollar was asking him questions in logic; it was infinitely tedious,\r\nand suddenly he noticed that he wore elastic-sided boots: it was\r\ngrotesque and ridiculous; so he withdrew his mind and thought of the\r\ngothic beauty of the Chapel at King\xe2\x80\x99s. But he had spent some delightful\r\ndays at Cambridge; he had given better dinners than anyone he knew; and\r\nthe conversation in his rooms had been often memorable. He quoted to\r\nPhilip the exquisite epigram:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey told me, Herakleitus, they told me you were dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now, when he related again the picturesque little anecdote about\r\nthe examiner and his boots, he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it was folly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was a folly in which there\r\nwas something fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, with a little thrill, thought it magnificent.\r\n\r\nThen Hayward went to London to read for the Bar. He had charming rooms\r\nin Clement\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, with panelled walls, and he tried to make them look\r\nlike his old rooms at the Hall. He had ambitions that were vaguely\r\npolitical, he described himself as a Whig, and he was put up for a club\r\nwhich was of Liberal but gentlemanly flavour. His idea was to practise\r\nat the Bar (he chose the Chancery side as less brutal), and get a seat\r\nfor some pleasant constituency as soon as the various promises made him\r\nwere carried out; meanwhile he went a great deal to the opera, and made\r\nacquaintance with a small number of charming people who admired the\r\nthings that he admired. He joined a dining-club of which the motto was,\r\nThe Whole, The Good, and The Beautiful. He formed a platonic friendship\r\nwith a lady some years older than himself, who lived in Kensington\r\nSquare; and nearly every afternoon he drank tea with her by the light\r\nof shaded candles, and talked of George Meredith and Walter Pater. It\r\nwas notorious that any fool could pass the examinations of the Bar\r\nCouncil, and he pursued his studies in a dilatory fashion. When he was\r\nploughed for his final he looked upon it as a personal affront. At the\r\nsame time the lady in Kensington Square told him that her husband was\r\ncoming home from India on leave, and was a man, though worthy in every\r\nway, of a commonplace mind, who would not understand a young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrequent visits. Hayward felt that life was full of ugliness, his soul\r\nrevolted from the thought of affronting again the cynicism of\r\nexaminers, and he saw something rather splendid in kicking away the\r\nball which lay at his feet. He was also a good deal in debt: it was\r\ndifficult to live in London like a gentleman on three hundred a year;\r\nand his heart yearned for the Venice and Florence which John Ruskin had\r\nso magically described. He felt that he was unsuited to the vulgar\r\nbustle of the Bar, for he had discovered that it was not sufficient to\r\nput your name on a door to get briefs; and modern politics seemed to\r\nlack nobility. He felt himself a poet. He disposed of his rooms in\r\nClement\xe2\x80\x99s Inn and went to Italy. He had spent a winter in Florence and\r\na winter in Rome, and now was passing his second summer abroad in\r\nGermany so that he might read Goethe in the original.\r\n\r\nHayward had one gift which was very precious. He had a real feeling for\r\nliterature, and he could impart his own passion with an admirable\r\nfluency. He could throw himself into sympathy with a writer and see all\r\nthat was best in him, and then he could talk about him with\r\nunderstanding. Philip had read a great deal, but he had read without\r\ndiscrimination everything that he happened to come across, and it was\r\nvery good for him now to meet someone who could guide his taste. He\r\nborrowed books from the small lending library which the town possessed\r\nand began reading all the wonderful things that Hayward spoke of. He\r\ndid not read always with enjoyment but invariably with perseverance. He\r\nwas eager for self-improvement. He felt himself very ignorant and very\r\nhumble. By the end of August, when Weeks returned from South Germany,\r\nPhilip was completely under Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s influence. Hayward did not like\r\nWeeks. He deplored the American\xe2\x80\x99s black coat and pepper-and-salt\r\ntrousers, and spoke with a scornful shrug of his New England\r\nconscience. Philip listened complacently to the abuse of a man who had\r\ngone out of his way to be kind to him, but when Weeks in his turn made\r\ndisagreeable remarks about Hayward he lost his temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour new friend looks like a poet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Weeks, with a thin smile on\r\nhis careworn, bitter mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you so? In America we should call him a pretty fair\r\nspecimen of a waster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in America,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip frigidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old is he? Twenty-five? And he does nothing but stay in pensions\r\nand write poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip hotly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I do: I\xe2\x80\x99ve met a hundred and forty-seven of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeeks\xe2\x80\x99 eyes twinkled, but Philip, who did not understand American\r\nhumour, pursed his lips and looked severe. Weeks to Philip seemed a man\r\nof middle age, but he was in point of fact little more than thirty. He\r\nhad a long, thin body and the scholar\xe2\x80\x99s stoop; his head was large and\r\nugly; he had pale scanty hair and an earthy skin; his thin mouth and\r\nthin, long nose, and the great protuberance of his frontal bones, gave\r\nhim an uncouth look. He was cold and precise in his manner, a bloodless\r\nman, without passion; but he had a curious vein of frivolity which\r\ndisconcerted the serious-minded among whom his instincts naturally\r\nthrew him. He was studying theology in Heidelberg, but the other\r\ntheological students of his own nationality looked upon him with\r\nsuspicion. He was very unorthodox, which frightened them; and his\r\nfreakish humour excited their disapproval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you have known a hundred and forty-seven of him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve met him in the Latin Quarter in Paris, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve met him in\r\npensions in Berlin and Munich. He lives in small hotels in Perugia and\r\nAssisi. He stands by the dozen before the Botticellis in Florence, and\r\nhe sits on all the benches of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. In Italy he\r\ndrinks a little too much wine, and in Germany he drinks a great deal\r\ntoo much beer. He always admires the right thing whatever the right\r\nthing is, and one of these days he\xe2\x80\x99s going to write a great work. Think\r\nof it, there are a hundred and forty-seven great works reposing in the\r\nbosoms of a hundred and forty-seven great men, and the tragic thing is\r\nthat not one of those hundred and forty-seven great works will ever be\r\nwritten. And yet the world goes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeeks spoke seriously, but his gray eyes twinkled a little at the end\r\nof his long speech, and Philip flushed when he saw that the American\r\nwas making fun of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do talk rot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said crossly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nWeeks had two little rooms at the back of Frau Erlin\xe2\x80\x99s house, and one\r\nof them, arranged as a parlour, was comfortable enough for him to\r\ninvite people to sit in. After supper, urged perhaps by the impish\r\nhumour which was the despair of his friends in Cambridge, Mass., he\r\noften asked Philip and Hayward to come in for a chat. He received them\r\nwith elaborate courtesy and insisted on their sitting in the only two\r\ncomfortable chairs in the room. Though he did not drink himself, with a\r\npoliteness of which Philip recognised the irony, he put a couple of\r\nbottles of beer at Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s elbow, and he insisted on lighting matches\r\nwhenever in the heat of argument Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s pipe went out. At the\r\nbeginning of their acquaintance Hayward, as a member of so celebrated a\r\nuniversity, had adopted a patronising attitude towards Weeks, who was a\r\ngraduate of Harvard; and when by chance the conversation turned upon\r\nthe Greek tragedians, a subject upon which Hayward felt he spoke with\r\nauthority, he had assumed the air that it was his part to give\r\ninformation rather than to exchange ideas. Weeks had listened politely,\r\nwith smiling modesty, till Hayward finished; then he asked one or two\r\ninsidious questions, so innocent in appearance that Hayward, not seeing\r\ninto what a quandary they led him, answered blandly; Weeks made a\r\ncourteous objection, then a correction of fact, after that a quotation\r\nfrom some little known Latin commentator, then a reference to a German\r\nauthority; and the fact was disclosed that he was a scholar. With\r\nsmiling ease, apologetically, Weeks tore to pieces all that Hayward had\r\nsaid; with elaborate civility he displayed the superficiality of his\r\nattainments. He mocked him with gentle irony. Philip could not help\r\nseeing that Hayward looked a perfect fool, and Hayward had not the\r\nsense to hold his tongue; in his irritation, his self-assurance\r\nundaunted, he attempted to argue: he made wild statements and Weeks\r\namicably corrected them; he reasoned falsely and Weeks proved that he\r\nwas absurd: Weeks confessed that he had taught Greek Literature at\r\nHarvard. Hayward gave a laugh of scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have known it. Of course you read Greek like a schoolmaster,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI read it like a poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you find it more poetic when you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what it\r\nmeans? I thought it was only in revealed religion that a mistranslation\r\nimproved the sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last, having finished the beer, Hayward left Weeks\xe2\x80\x99 room hot and\r\ndishevelled; with an angry gesture he said to Philip:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course the man\xe2\x80\x99s a pedant. He has no real feeling for beauty.\r\nAccuracy is the virtue of clerks. It\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit of the Greeks that we\r\naim at. Weeks is like that fellow who went to hear Rubenstein and\r\ncomplained that he played false notes. False notes! What did they\r\nmatter when he played divinely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, not knowing how many incompetent people have found solace in\r\nthese false notes, was much impressed.\r\n\r\nHayward could never resist the opportunity which Weeks offered him of\r\nregaining ground lost on a previous occasion, and Weeks was able with\r\nthe greatest ease to draw him into a discussion. Though he could not\r\nhelp seeing how small his attainments were beside the American\xe2\x80\x99s, his\r\nBritish pertinacity, his wounded vanity (perhaps they are the same\r\nthing), would not allow him to give up the struggle. Hayward seemed to\r\ntake a delight in displaying his ignorance, self-satisfaction, and\r\nwrongheadedness. Whenever Hayward said something which was illogical,\r\nWeeks in a few words would show the falseness of his reasoning, pause\r\nfor a moment to enjoy his triumph, and then hurry on to another subject\r\nas though Christian charity impelled him to spare the vanquished foe.\r\nPhilip tried sometimes to put in something to help his friend, and\r\nWeeks gently crushed him, but so kindly, differently from the way in\r\nwhich he answered Hayward, that even Philip, outrageously sensitive,\r\ncould not feel hurt. Now and then, losing his calm as he felt himself\r\nmore and more foolish, Hayward became abusive, and only the American\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsmiling politeness prevented the argument from degenerating into a\r\nquarrel. On these occasions when Hayward left Weeks\xe2\x80\x99 room he muttered\r\nangrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamned Yankee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat settled it. It was a perfect answer to an argument which had\r\nseemed unanswerable.\r\n\r\nThough they began by discussing all manner of subjects in Weeks\xe2\x80\x99 little\r\nroom eventually the conversation always turned to religion: the\r\ntheological student took a professional interest in it, and Hayward\r\nwelcomed a subject in which hard facts need not disconcert him; when\r\nfeeling is the gauge you can snap your angers at logic, and when your\r\nlogic is weak that is very agreeable. Hayward found it difficult to\r\nexplain his beliefs to Philip without a great flow of words; but it was\r\nclear (and this fell in with Philip\xe2\x80\x99s idea of the natural order of\r\nthings), that he had been brought up in the church by law established.\r\nThough he had now given up all idea of becoming a Roman Catholic, he\r\nstill looked upon that communion with sympathy. He had much to say in\r\nits praise, and he compared favourably its gorgeous ceremonies with the\r\nsimple services of the Church of England. He gave Philip Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nApologia to read, and Philip, finding it very dull, nevertheless read\r\nit to the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it for its style, not for its matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hayward.\r\n\r\nHe talked enthusiastically of the music at the Oratory, and said\r\ncharming things about the connection between incense and the devotional\r\nspirit. Weeks listened to him with his frigid smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it proves the truth of Roman Catholicism that John Henry\r\nNewman wrote good English and that Cardinal Manning has a picturesque\r\nappearance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHayward hinted that he had gone through much trouble with his soul. For\r\na year he had swum in a sea of darkness. He passed his fingers through\r\nhis fair, waving hair and told them that he would not for five hundred\r\npounds endure again those agonies of mind. Fortunately he had reached\r\ncalm waters at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you believe?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, who was never satisfied with\r\nvague statements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in the Whole, the Good, and the Beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHayward with his loose large limbs and the fine carriage of his head\r\nlooked very handsome when he said this, and he said it with an air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that how you would describe your religion in a census paper?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nWeeks, in mild tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate the rigid definition: it\xe2\x80\x99s so ugly, so obvious. If you like I\r\nwill say that I believe in the church of the Duke of Wellington and Mr.\r\nGladstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the Church of England,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh wise young man!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Hayward, with a smile which made Philip\r\nblush, for he felt that in putting into plain words what the other had\r\nexpressed in a paraphrase, he had been guilty of vulgarity. \xe2\x80\x9cI belong\r\nto the Church of England. But I love the gold and the silk which clothe\r\nthe priest of Rome, and his celibacy, and the confessional, and\r\npurgatory: and in the darkness of an Italian cathedral, incense-laden\r\nand mysterious, I believe with all my heart in the miracle of the Mass.\r\nIn Venice I have seen a fisherwoman come in, barefoot, throw down her\r\nbasket of fish by her side, fall on her knees, and pray to the Madonna;\r\nand that I felt was the real faith, and I prayed and believed with her.\r\nBut I believe also in Aphrodite and Apollo and the Great God Pan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a charming voice, and he chose his words as he spoke; he uttered\r\nthem almost rhythmically. He would have gone on, but Weeks opened a\r\nsecond bottle of beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me give you something to drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHayward turned to Philip with the slightly condescending gesture which\r\nso impressed the youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow are you satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nPhilip, somewhat bewildered, confessed that he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t add a little Buddhism,\xe2\x80\x9d said Weeks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I confess I have a sort of sympathy for Mahomet; I regret that you\r\nshould have left him out in the cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHayward laughed, for he was in a good humour with himself that evening,\r\nand the ring of his sentences still sounded pleasant in his ears. He\r\nemptied his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWith your cold\r\nAmerican intelligence you can only adopt the critical attitude. Emerson\r\nand all that sort of thing. But what is criticism? Criticism is purely\r\ndestructive; anyone can destroy, but not everyone can build up. You are\r\na pedant, my dear fellow. The important thing is to construct: I am\r\nconstructive; I am a poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeeks looked at him with eyes which seemed at the same time to be quite\r\ngrave and yet to be smiling brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying so, you\xe2\x80\x99re a little drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Hayward cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd not enough for\r\nme to be unable to overwhelm you in argument. But come, I have\r\nunbosomed my soul; now tell us what your religion is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeeks put his head on one side so that he looked like a sparrow on a\r\nperch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to find that out for years. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m a Unitarian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s a dissenter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe could not imagine why they both burst into laughter, Hayward\r\nuproariously, and Weeks with a funny chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in England dissenters aren\xe2\x80\x99t gentlemen, are they?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Weeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you ask me point-blank, they\xe2\x80\x99re not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Philip rather\r\ncrossly.\r\n\r\nHe hated being laughed at, and they laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you tell me what a gentleman is?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Weeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; everyone knows what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo doubt had ever crossed Philip\xe2\x80\x99s mind on the subject, but he knew it\r\nwas not a thing to state of oneself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a man tells you he\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman you can bet your boots he isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s truthfulness made it difficult for him to answer, but he was\r\nnaturally polite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re different,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re American, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we may take it that only Englishmen are gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWeeks gravely.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not contradict him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you give me a few more particulars?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Weeks.\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened, but, growing angry, did not care if he made himself\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can give you plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d He remembered his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s saying that it took\r\nthree generations to make a gentleman: it was a companion proverb to\r\nthe silk purse and the sow\xe2\x80\x99s ear. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all he\xe2\x80\x99s the son of a\r\ngentleman, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been to a public school, and to Oxford or\r\nCambridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdinburgh wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Weeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he talks English like a gentleman, and he wears the right sort of\r\nthings, and if he\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman he can always tell if another chap\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed rather lame to Philip as he went on, but there it was: that\r\nwas what he meant by the word, and everyone he had ever known had meant\r\nthat too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is evident to me that I am not a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Weeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee why you should have been so surprised because I was a dissenter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what a Unitarian is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nWeeks in his odd way again put his head on one side: you almost\r\nexpected him to twitter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Unitarian very earnestly disbelieves in almost everything that\r\nanybody else believes, and he has a very lively sustaining faith in he\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should make fun of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI really\r\nwant to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, I\xe2\x80\x99m not making fun of you. I have arrived at that\r\ndefinition after years of great labour and the most anxious,\r\nnerve-racking study.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Philip and Hayward got up to go, Weeks handed Philip a little book\r\nin a paper cover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you can read French pretty well by now. I wonder if this\r\nwould amuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thanked him and, taking the book, looked at the title. It was\r\nRenan\xe2\x80\x99s Vie de Jesus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt occurred neither to Hayward nor to Weeks that the conversations\r\nwhich helped them to pass an idle evening were being turned over\r\nafterwards in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s active brain. It had never struck him before\r\nthat religion was a matter upon which discussion was possible. To him\r\nit meant the Church of England, and not to believe in its tenets was a\r\nsign of wilfulness which could not fail of punishment here or\r\nhereafter. There was some doubt in his mind about the chastisement of\r\nunbelievers. It was possible that a merciful judge, reserving the\r\nflames of hell for the heathen\xe2\x80\x94Mahommedans, Buddhists, and the\r\nrest\xe2\x80\x94would spare Dissenters and Roman Catholics (though at the cost of\r\nhow much humiliation when they were made to realise their error!), and\r\nit was also possible that He would be pitiful to those who had had no\r\nchance of learning the truth,\xe2\x80\x94this was reasonable enough, though such\r\nwere the activities of the Missionary Society there could not be many\r\nin this condition\xe2\x80\x94but if the chance had been theirs and they had\r\nneglected it (in which category were obviously Roman Catholics and\r\nDissenters), the punishment was sure and merited. It was clear that the\r\nmiscreant was in a parlous state. Perhaps Philip had not been taught it\r\nin so many words, but certainly the impression had been given him that\r\nonly members of the Church of England had any real hope of eternal\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that Philip had heard definitely stated was that the\r\nunbeliever was a wicked and a vicious man; but Weeks, though he\r\nbelieved in hardly anything that Philip believed, led a life of\r\nChristian purity. Philip had received little kindness in his life, and\r\nhe was touched by the American\xe2\x80\x99s desire to help him: once when a cold\r\nkept him in bed for three days, Weeks nursed him like a mother. There\r\nwas neither vice nor wickedness in him, but only sincerity and\r\nloving-kindness. It was evidently possible to be virtuous and\r\nunbelieving.\r\n\r\nAlso Philip had been given to understand that people adhered to other\r\nfaiths only from obstinacy or self-interest: in their hearts they knew\r\nthey were false; they deliberately sought to deceive others. Now, for\r\nthe sake of his German he had been accustomed on Sunday mornings to\r\nattend the Lutheran service, but when Hayward arrived he began instead\r\nto go with him to Mass. He noticed that, whereas the Protestant church\r\nwas nearly empty and the congregation had a listless air, the Jesuit on\r\nthe other hand was crowded and the worshippers seemed to pray with all\r\ntheir hearts. They had not the look of hypocrites. He was surprised at\r\nthe contrast; for he knew of course that the Lutherans, whose faith was\r\ncloser to that of the Church of England, on that account were nearer\r\nthe truth than the Roman Catholics. Most of the men\xe2\x80\x94it was largely a\r\nmasculine congregation\xe2\x80\x94were South Germans; and he could not help saying\r\nto himself that if he had been born in South Germany he would certainly\r\nhave been a Roman Catholic. He might just as well have been born in a\r\nRoman Catholic country as in England; and in England as well in a\r\nWesleyan, Baptist, or Methodist family as in one that fortunately\r\nbelonged to the church by law established. He was a little breathless\r\nat the danger he had run. Philip was on friendly terms with the little\r\nChinaman who sat at table with him twice each day. His name was Sung.\r\nHe was always smiling, affable, and polite. It seemed strange that he\r\nshould frizzle in hell merely because he was a Chinaman; but if\r\nsalvation was possible whatever a man\xe2\x80\x99s faith was, there did not seem\r\nto be any particular advantage in belonging to the Church of England.\r\n\r\nPhilip, more puzzled than he had ever been in his life, sounded Weeks.\r\nHe had to be careful, for he was very sensitive to ridicule; and the\r\nacidulous humour with which the American treated the Church of England\r\ndisconcerted him. Weeks only puzzled him more. He made Philip\r\nacknowledge that those South Germans whom he saw in the Jesuit church\r\nwere every bit as firmly convinced of the truth of Roman Catholicism as\r\nhe was of that of the Church of England, and from that he led him to\r\nadmit that the Mahommedan and the Buddhist were convinced also of the\r\ntruth of their respective religions. It looked as though knowing that\r\nyou were right meant nothing; they all knew they were right. Weeks had\r\nno intention of undermining the boy\xe2\x80\x99s faith, but he was deeply\r\ninterested in religion, and found it an absorbing topic of\r\nconversation. He had described his own views accurately when he said\r\nthat he very earnestly disbelieved in almost everything that other\r\npeople believed. Once Philip asked him a question, which he had heard\r\nhis uncle put when the conversation at the vicarage had fallen upon\r\nsome mildly rationalistic work which was then exciting discussion in\r\nthe newspapers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you be right and all those fellows like St. Anselm and\r\nSt. Augustine be wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that they were very clever and learned men, while you have\r\ngrave doubts whether I am either?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Weeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip uncertainly, for put in that way his question\r\nseemed impertinent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Augustine believed that the earth was flat and that the sun turned\r\nround it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that proves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it proves that you believe with your generation. Your saints\r\nlived in an age of faith, when it was practically impossible to\r\ndisbelieve what to us is positively incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how d\xe2\x80\x99you know that we have the truth now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thought this over for a moment, then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why the things we believe absolutely now shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be just\r\nas wrong as what they believed in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither do I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how can you believe anything at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip asked Weeks what he thought of Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s religion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen have always formed gods in their own image,\xe2\x80\x9d said Weeks. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nbelieves in the picturesque.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip paused for a little while, then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why one should believe in God at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were no sooner out of his mouth than he realised that he had\r\nceased to do so. It took his breath away like a plunge into cold water.\r\nHe looked at Weeks with startled eyes. Suddenly he felt afraid. He left\r\nWeeks as quickly as he could. He wanted to be alone. It was the most\r\nstartling experience that he had ever had. He tried to think it all\r\nout; it was very exciting, since his whole life seemed concerned (he\r\nthought his decision on this matter must profoundly affect its course)\r\nand a mistake might lead to eternal damnation; but the more he\r\nreflected the more convinced he was; and though during the next few\r\nweeks he read books, aids to scepticism, with eager interest it was\r\nonly to confirm him in what he felt instinctively. The fact was that he\r\nhad ceased to believe not for this reason or the other, but because he\r\nhad not the religious temperament. Faith had been forced upon him from\r\nthe outside. It was a matter of environment and example. A new\r\nenvironment and a new example gave him the opportunity to find himself.\r\nHe put off the faith of his childhood quite simply, like a cloak that\r\nhe no longer needed. At first life seemed strange and lonely without\r\nthe belief which, though he never realised it, had been an unfailing\r\nsupport. He felt like a man who has leaned on a stick and finds himself\r\nforced suddenly to walk without assistance. It really seemed as though\r\nthe days were colder and the nights more solitary. But he was upheld by\r\nthe excitement; it seemed to make life a more thrilling adventure; and\r\nin a little while the stick which he had thrown aside, the cloak which\r\nhad fallen from his shoulders, seemed an intolerable burden of which he\r\nhad been eased. The religious exercises which for so many years had\r\nbeen forced upon him were part and parcel of religion to him. He\r\nthought of the collects and epistles which he had been made to learn by\r\nheart, and the long services at the Cathedral through which he had sat\r\nwhen every limb itched with the desire for movement; and he remembered\r\nthose walks at night through muddy roads to the parish church at\r\nBlackstable, and the coldness of that bleak building; he sat with his\r\nfeet like ice, his fingers numb and heavy, and all around was the\r\nsickly odour of pomatum. Oh, he had been so bored! His heart leaped\r\nwhen he saw he was free from all that.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at himself because he ceased to believe so easily,\r\nand, not knowing that he felt as he did on account of the subtle\r\nworkings of his inmost nature, he ascribed the certainty he had reached\r\nto his own cleverness. He was unduly pleased with himself. With youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlack of sympathy for an attitude other than its own he despised not a\r\nlittle Weeks and Hayward because they were content with the vague\r\nemotion which they called God and would not take the further step which\r\nto himself seemed so obvious. One day he went alone up a certain hill\r\nso that he might see a view which, he knew not why, filled him always\r\nwith wild exhilaration. It was autumn now, but often the days were\r\ncloudless still, and then the sky seemed to glow with a more splendid\r\nlight: it was as though nature consciously sought to put a fuller\r\nvehemence into the remaining days of fair weather. He looked down upon\r\nthe plain, a-quiver with the sun, stretching vastly before him: in the\r\ndistance were the roofs of Mannheim and ever so far away the dimness of\r\nWorms. Here and there a more piercing glitter was the Rhine. The\r\ntremendous spaciousness of it was glowing with rich gold. Philip, as he\r\nstood there, his heart beating with sheer joy, thought how the tempter\r\nhad stood with Jesus on a high mountain and shown him the kingdoms of\r\nthe earth. To Philip, intoxicated with the beauty of the scene, it\r\nseemed that it was the whole world which was spread before him, and he\r\nwas eager to step down and enjoy it. He was free from degrading fears\r\nand free from prejudice. He could go his way without the intolerable\r\ndread of hell-fire. Suddenly he realised that he had lost also that\r\nburden of responsibility which made every action of his life a matter\r\nof urgent consequence. He could breathe more freely in a lighter air.\r\nHe was responsible only to himself for the things he did. Freedom! He\r\nwas his own master at last. From old habit, unconsciously he thanked\r\nGod that he no longer believed in Him.\r\n\r\nDrunk with pride in his intelligence and in his fearlessness, Philip\r\nentered deliberately upon a new life. But his loss of faith made less\r\ndifference in his behaviour than he expected. Though he had thrown on\r\none side the Christian dogmas it never occurred to him to criticise the\r\nChristian ethics; he accepted the Christian virtues, and indeed thought\r\nit fine to practise them for their own sake, without a thought of\r\nreward or punishment. There was small occasion for heroism in the Frau\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s house, but he was a little more exactly truthful than he\r\nhad been, and he forced himself to be more than commonly attentive to\r\nthe dull, elderly ladies who sometimes engaged him in conversation. The\r\ngentle oath, the violent adjective, which are typical of our language\r\nand which he had cultivated before as a sign of manliness, he now\r\nelaborately eschewed.\r\n\r\nHaving settled the whole matter to his satisfaction he sought to put it\r\nout of his mind, but that was more easily said than done; and he could\r\nnot prevent the regrets nor stifle the misgivings which sometimes\r\ntormented him. He was so young and had so few friends that immortality\r\nhad no particular attractions for him, and he was able without trouble\r\nto give up belief in it; but there was one thing which made him\r\nwretched; he told himself that he was unreasonable, he tried to laugh\r\nhimself out of such pathos; but the tears really came to his eyes when\r\nhe thought that he would never see again the beautiful mother whose\r\nlove for him had grown more precious as the years since her death\r\npassed on. And sometimes, as though the influence of innumerable\r\nancestors, Godfearing and devout, were working in him unconsciously,\r\nthere seized him a panic fear that perhaps after all it was all true,\r\nand there was, up there behind the blue sky, a jealous God who would\r\npunish in everlasting flames the atheist. At these times his reason\r\ncould offer him no help, he imagined the anguish of a physical torment\r\nwhich would last endlessly, he felt quite sick with fear and burst into\r\na violent sweat. At last he would say to himself desperately:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault. I can\xe2\x80\x99t force myself to believe. If\r\nthere is a God after all and he punishes me because I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve in Him I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter set in. Weeks went to Berlin to attend the lectures of Paulssen,\r\nand Hayward began to think of going South. The local theatre opened its\r\ndoors. Philip and Hayward went to it two or three times a week with the\r\npraiseworthy intention of improving their German, and Philip found it a\r\nmore diverting manner of perfecting himself in the language than\r\nlistening to sermons. They found themselves in the midst of a revival\r\nof the drama. Several of Ibsen\xe2\x80\x99s plays were on the repertory for the\r\nwinter; Sudermann\xe2\x80\x99s Die Ehre was then a new play, and on its production\r\nin the quiet university town caused the greatest excitement; it was\r\nextravagantly praised and bitterly attacked; other dramatists followed\r\nwith plays written under the modern influence, and Philip witnessed a\r\nseries of works in which the vileness of mankind was displayed before\r\nhim. He had never been to a play in his life till then (poor touring\r\ncompanies sometimes came to the Assembly Rooms at Blackstable, but the\r\nVicar, partly on account of his profession, partly because he thought\r\nit would be vulgar, never went to see them) and the passion of the\r\nstage seized him. He felt a thrill the moment he got into the little,\r\nshabby, ill-lit theatre. Soon he came to know the peculiarities of the\r\nsmall company, and by the casting could tell at once what were the\r\ncharacteristics of the persons in the drama; but this made no\r\ndifference to him. To him it was real life. It was a strange life, dark\r\nand tortured, in which men and women showed to remorseless eyes the\r\nevil that was in their hearts: a fair face concealed a depraved mind;\r\nthe virtuous used virtue as a mask to hide their secret vice, the\r\nseeming-strong fainted within with their weakness; the honest were\r\ncorrupt, the chaste were lewd. You seemed to dwell in a room where the\r\nnight before an orgy had taken place: the windows had not been opened\r\nin the morning; the air was foul with the dregs of beer, and stale\r\nsmoke, and flaring gas. There was no laughter. At most you sniggered at\r\nthe hypocrite or the fool: the characters expressed themselves in cruel\r\nwords that seemed wrung out of their hearts by shame and anguish.\r\n\r\nPhilip was carried away by the sordid intensity of it. He seemed to see\r\nthe world again in another fashion, and this world too he was anxious\r\nto know. After the play was over he went to a tavern and sat in the\r\nbright warmth with Hayward to eat a sandwich and drink a glass of beer.\r\nAll round were little groups of students, talking and laughing; and\r\nhere and there was a family, father and mother, a couple of sons and a\r\ngirl; and sometimes the girl said a sharp thing, and the father leaned\r\nback in his chair and laughed, laughed heartily. It was very friendly\r\nand innocent. There was a pleasant homeliness in the scene, but for\r\nthis Philip had no eyes. His thoughts ran on the play he had just come\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do feel it\xe2\x80\x99s life, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I can stay here much longer. I want to get to London so\r\nthat I can really begin. I want to have experiences. I\xe2\x80\x99m so tired of\r\npreparing for life: I want to live it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes Hayward left Philip to go home by himself. He would never\r\nexactly reply to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eager questioning, but with a merry, rather\r\nstupid laugh, hinted at a romantic amour; he quoted a few lines of\r\nRossetti, and once showed Philip a sonnet in which passion and purple,\r\npessimism and pathos, were packed together on the subject of a young\r\nlady called Trude. Hayward surrounded his sordid and vulgar little\r\nadventures with a glow of poetry, and thought he touched hands with\r\nPericles and Pheidias because to describe the object of his attentions\r\nhe used the word hetaira instead of one of those, more blunt and apt,\r\nprovided by the English language. Philip in the daytime had been led by\r\ncuriosity to pass through the little street near the old bridge, with\r\nits neat white houses and green shutters, in which according to Hayward\r\nthe Fraulein Trude lived; but the women, with brutal faces and painted\r\ncheeks, who came out of their doors and cried out to him, filled him\r\nwith fear; and he fled in horror from the rough hands that sought to\r\ndetain him. He yearned above all things for experience and felt himself\r\nridiculous because at his age he had not enjoyed that which all fiction\r\ntaught him was the most important thing in life; but he had the\r\nunfortunate gift of seeing things as they were, and the reality which\r\nwas offered him differed too terribly from the ideal of his dreams.\r\n\r\nHe did not know how wide a country, arid and precipitous, must be\r\ncrossed before the traveller through life comes to an acceptance of\r\nreality. It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those\r\nwho have lost it; but the young know they are wretched, for they are\r\nfull of the truthless ideals which have been instilled into them, and\r\neach time they come in contact with the real they are bruised and\r\nwounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy; for the\r\nbooks they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the\r\nconversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a\r\nrosy haze of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must\r\ndiscover for themselves that all they have read and all they have been\r\ntold are lies, lies, lies; and each discovery is another nail driven\r\ninto the body on the cross of life. The strange thing is that each one\r\nwho has gone through that bitter disillusionment adds to it in his\r\nturn, unconsciously, by the power within him which is stronger than\r\nhimself. The companionship of Hayward was the worst possible thing for\r\nPhilip. He was a man who saw nothing for himself, but only through a\r\nliterary atmosphere, and he was dangerous because he had deceived\r\nhimself into sincerity. He honestly mistook his sensuality for romantic\r\nemotion, his vacillation for the artistic temperament, and his idleness\r\nfor philosophic calm. His mind, vulgar in its effort at refinement, saw\r\neverything a little larger than life size, with the outlines blurred,\r\nin a golden mist of sentimentality. He lied and never knew that he\r\nlied, and when it was pointed out to him said that lies were beautiful.\r\nHe was an idealist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip was restless and dissatisfied. Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s poetic allusions\r\ntroubled his imagination, and his soul yearned for romance. At least\r\nthat was how he put it to himself.\r\n\r\nAnd it happened that an incident was taking place in Frau Erlin\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nwhich increased Philip\xe2\x80\x99s preoccupation with the matter of sex. Two or\r\nthree times on his walks among the hills he had met Fraulein Cacilie\r\nwandering by herself. He had passed her with a bow, and a few yards\r\nfurther on had seen the Chinaman. He thought nothing of it; but one\r\nevening on his way home, when night had already fallen, he passed two\r\npeople walking very close together. Hearing his footstep, they\r\nseparated quickly, and though he could not see well in the darkness he\r\nwas almost certain they were Cacilie and Herr Sung. Their rapid\r\nmovement apart suggested that they had been walking arm in arm. Philip\r\nwas puzzled and surprised. He had never paid much attention to Fraulein\r\nCacilie. She was a plain girl, with a square face and blunt features.\r\nShe could not have been more than sixteen, since she still wore her\r\nlong fair hair in a plait. That evening at supper he looked at her\r\ncuriously; and, though of late she had talked little at meals, she\r\naddressed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you go for your walk today, Herr Carey?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I walked up towards the Konigstuhl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out,\xe2\x80\x9d she volunteered. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a headache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman, who sat next to her, turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it\xe2\x80\x99s better now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFraulein Cacilie was evidently uneasy, for she spoke again to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you meet many people on the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip could not help reddening when he told a downright lie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I saw a living soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fancied that a look of relief passed across her eyes.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, there could be no doubt that there was something between\r\nthe pair, and other people in the Frau Professor\xe2\x80\x99s house saw them\r\nlurking in dark places. The elderly ladies who sat at the head of the\r\ntable began to discuss what was now a scandal. The Frau Professor was\r\nangry and harassed. She had done her best to see nothing. The winter\r\nwas at hand, and it was not as easy a matter then as in the summer to\r\nkeep her house full. Herr Sung was a good customer: he had two rooms on\r\nthe ground floor, and he drank a bottle of Moselle at each meal. The\r\nFrau Professor charged him three marks a bottle and made a good profit.\r\nNone of her other guests drank wine, and some of them did not even\r\ndrink beer. Neither did she wish to lose Fraulein Cacilie, whose\r\nparents were in business in South America and paid well for the Frau\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s motherly care; and she knew that if she wrote to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuncle, who lived in Berlin, he would immediately take her away. The\r\nFrau Professor contented herself with giving them both severe looks at\r\ntable and, though she dared not be rude to the Chinaman, got a certain\r\nsatisfaction out of incivility to Cacilie. But the three elderly ladies\r\nwere not content. Two were widows, and one, a Dutchwoman, was a\r\nspinster of masculine appearance; they paid the smallest possible sum\r\nfor their pension, and gave a good deal of trouble, but they were\r\npermanent and therefore had to be put up with. They went to the Frau\r\nProfessor and said that something must be done; it was disgraceful, and\r\nthe house was ceasing to be respectable. The Frau Professor tried\r\nobstinacy, anger, tears, but the three old ladies routed her, and with\r\na sudden assumption of virtuous indignation she said that she would put\r\na stop to the whole thing.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon she took Cacilie into her bed-room and began to talk\r\nvery seriously to her; but to her amazement the girl adopted a brazen\r\nattitude; she proposed to go about as she liked; and if she chose to\r\nwalk with the Chinaman she could not see it was anybody\xe2\x80\x99s business but\r\nher own. The Frau Professor threatened to write to her uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Onkel Heinrich will put me in a family in Berlin for the winter,\r\nand that will be much nicer for me. And Herr Sung will come to Berlin\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Frau Professor began to cry. The tears rolled down her coarse, red,\r\nfat cheeks; and Cacilie laughed at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will mean three rooms empty all through the winter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThen the Frau Professor tried another plan. She appealed to Fraulein\r\nCacilie\xe2\x80\x99s better nature: she was kind, sensible, tolerant; she treated\r\nher no longer as a child, but as a grown woman. She said that it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so dreadful, but a Chinaman, with his yellow skin and flat\r\nnose, and his little pig\xe2\x80\x99s eyes! That\xe2\x80\x99s what made it so horrible. It\r\nfilled one with disgust to think of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBitte, bitte,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cacilie, with a rapid intake of the breath. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t listen to anything against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not serious?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Frau Erlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love him. I love him. I love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGott im Himmel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Frau Professor stared at her with horrified surprise; she had\r\nthought it was no more than naughtiness on the child\xe2\x80\x99s part, and\r\ninnocent, folly. but the passion in her voice revealed everything.\r\nCacilie looked at her for a moment with flaming eyes, and then with a\r\nshrug of her shoulders went out of the room.\r\n\r\nFrau Erlin kept the details of the interview to herself, and a day or\r\ntwo later altered the arrangement of the table. She asked Herr Sung if\r\nhe would not come and sit at her end, and he with his unfailing\r\npoliteness accepted with alacrity. Cacilie took the change\r\nindifferently. But as if the discovery that the relations between them\r\nwere known to the whole household made them more shameless, they made\r\nno secret now of their walks together, and every afternoon quite openly\r\nset out to wander about the hills. It was plain that they did not care\r\nwhat was said of them. At last even the placidity of Professor Erlin\r\nwas moved, and he insisted that his wife should speak to the Chinaman.\r\nShe took him aside in his turn and expostulated; he was ruining the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s reputation, he was doing harm to the house, he must see how\r\nwrong and wicked his conduct was; but she was met with smiling denials;\r\nHerr Sung did not know what she was talking about, he was not paying\r\nany attention to Fraulein Cacilie, he never walked with her; it was all\r\nuntrue, every word of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, Herr Sung, how can you say such things? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been seen again\r\nand again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99re mistaken. It\xe2\x80\x99s untrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with an unceasing smile, which showed his even, little\r\nwhite teeth. He was quite calm. He denied everything. He denied with\r\nbland effrontery. At last the Frau Professor lost her temper and said\r\nthe girl had confessed she loved him. He was not moved. He continued to\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Nonsense! It\xe2\x80\x99s all untrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could get nothing out of him. The weather grew very bad; there was\r\nsnow and frost, and then a thaw with a long succession of cheerless\r\ndays, on which walking was a poor amusement. One evening when Philip\r\nhad just finished his German lesson with the Herr Professor and was\r\nstanding for a moment in the drawing-room, talking to Frau Erlin, Anna\r\ncame quickly in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, where is Cacilie?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she\xe2\x80\x99s in her room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no light in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Frau Professor gave an exclamation, and she looked at her daughter\r\nin dismay. The thought which was in Anna\xe2\x80\x99s head had flashed across\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRing for Emil,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hoarsely.\r\n\r\nThis was the stupid lout who waited at table and did most of the\r\nhousework. He came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmil, go down to Herr Sung\xe2\x80\x99s room and enter without knocking. If\r\nanyone is there say you came in to see about the stove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sign of astonishment appeared on Emil\xe2\x80\x99s phlegmatic face.\r\n\r\nHe went slowly downstairs. The Frau Professor and Anna left the door\r\nopen and listened. Presently they heard Emil come up again, and they\r\ncalled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas anyone there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Frau Professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Herr Sung was there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beginning of a cunning smile narrowed his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Fraulein Cacilie was there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s disgraceful,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Frau Professor.\r\n\r\nNow he smiled broadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFraulein Cacilie is there every evening. She spends hours at a time\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrau Professor began to wring her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how abominable! But why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was no business of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, slowly shrugging his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they paid you well. Go away. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lurched clumsily to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must go away, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is going to pay the rent? And the taxes are falling due. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall very well for you to say they must go away. If they go away I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npay the bills.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to Philip, with tears streaming down her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cAch, Herr Carey, you will not say what you have heard. If\r\nFraulein Forster\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d this was the Dutch spinster\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif Fraulein Forster\r\nknew she would leave at once. And if they all go we must close the\r\nhouse. I cannot afford to keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she stays, I will not speak to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna.\r\n\r\nThat evening at supper Fraulein Cacilie, redder than usual, with a look\r\nof obstinacy on her face, took her place punctually; but Herr Sung did\r\nnot appear, and for a while Philip thought he was going to shirk the\r\nordeal. At last he came, very smiling, his little eyes dancing with the\r\napologies he made for his late arrival. He insisted as usual on pouring\r\nout the Frau Professor a glass of his Moselle, and he offered a glass\r\nto Fraulein Forster. The room was very hot, for the stove had been\r\nalight all day and the windows were seldom opened. Emil blundered\r\nabout, but succeeded somehow in serving everyone quickly and with\r\norder. The three old ladies sat in silence, visibly disapproving: the\r\nFrau Professor had scarcely recovered from her tears; her husband was\r\nsilent and oppressed. Conversation languished. It seemed to Philip that\r\nthere was something dreadful in that gathering which he had sat with so\r\noften; they looked different under the light of the two hanging lamps\r\nfrom what they had ever looked before; he was vaguely uneasy. Once he\r\ncaught Cacilie\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and he thought she looked at him with hatred and\r\ncontempt. The room was stifling. It was as though the beastly passion\r\nof that pair troubled them all; there was a feeling of Oriental\r\ndepravity; a faint savour of joss-sticks, a mystery of hidden vices,\r\nseemed to make their breath heavy. Philip could feel the beating of the\r\narteries in his forehead. He could not understand what strange emotion\r\ndistracted him; he seemed to feel something infinitely attractive, and\r\nyet he was repelled and horrified.\r\n\r\nFor several days things went on. The air was sickly with the unnatural\r\npassion which all felt about them, and the nerves of the little\r\nhousehold seemed to grow exasperated. Only Herr Sung remained\r\nunaffected; he was no less smiling, affable, and polite than he had\r\nbeen before: one could not tell whether his manner was a triumph of\r\ncivilisation or an expression of contempt on the part of the Oriental\r\nfor the vanquished West. Cacilie was flaunting and cynical. At last\r\neven the Frau Professor could bear the position no longer. Suddenly\r\npanic seized her; for Professor Erlin with brutal frankness had\r\nsuggested the possible consequences of an intrigue which was now\r\nmanifest to everyone, and she saw her good name in Heidelberg and the\r\nrepute of her house ruined by a scandal which could not possibly be\r\nhidden. For some reason, blinded perhaps by her interests, this\r\npossibility had never occurred to her; and now, her wits muddled by a\r\nterrible fear, she could hardly be prevented from turning the girl out\r\nof the house at once. It was due to Anna\xe2\x80\x99s good sense that a cautious\r\nletter was written to the uncle in Berlin suggesting that Cacilie\r\nshould be taken away.\r\n\r\nBut having made up her mind to lose the two lodgers, the Frau Professor\r\ncould not resist the satisfaction of giving rein to the ill-temper she\r\nhad curbed so long. She was free now to say anything she liked to\r\nCacilie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have written to your uncle, Cacilie, to take you away. I cannot have\r\nyou in my house any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer little round eyes sparkled when she noticed the sudden whiteness of\r\nthe girl\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re shameless. Shameless,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\r\nShe called her foul names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say to my uncle Heinrich, Frau Professor?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl\r\nasked, suddenly falling from her attitude of flaunting independence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you himself. I expect to get a letter from him\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext day, in order to make the humiliation more public, at supper she\r\ncalled down the table to Cacilie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a letter from your uncle, Cacilie. You are to pack your\r\nthings tonight, and we will put you in the train tomorrow morning. He\r\nwill meet you himself in Berlin at the Central Bahnhof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Frau Professor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerr Sung smiled in the Frau Professor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and notwithstanding her\r\nprotests insisted on pouring out a glass of wine for her. The Frau\r\nProfessor ate her supper with a good appetite. But she had triumphed\r\nunwisely. Just before going to bed she called the servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmil, if Fraulein Cacilie\xe2\x80\x99s box is ready you had better take it\r\ndownstairs tonight. The porter will fetch it before breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant went away and in a moment came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFraulein Cacilie is not in her room, and her bag has gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a cry the Frau Professor hurried along: the box was on the floor,\r\nstrapped and locked; but there was no bag, and neither hat nor cloak.\r\nThe dressing-table was empty. Breathing heavily, the Frau Professor ran\r\ndownstairs to the Chinaman\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, she had not moved so quickly for\r\ntwenty years, and Emil called out after her to beware she did not fall;\r\nshe did not trouble to knock, but burst in. The rooms were empty. The\r\nluggage had gone, and the door into the garden, still open, showed how\r\nit had been got away. In an envelope on the table were notes for the\r\nmoney due on the month\xe2\x80\x99s board and an approximate sum for extras.\r\nGroaning, suddenly overcome by her haste, the Frau Professor sank\r\nobesely on to a sofa. There could be no doubt. The pair had gone off\r\ntogether. Emil remained stolid and unmoved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHayward, after saying for a month that he was going South next day and\r\ndelaying from week to week out of inability to make up his mind to the\r\nbother of packing and the tedium of a journey, had at last been driven\r\noff just before Christmas by the preparations for that festival. He\r\ncould not support the thought of a Teutonic merry-making. It gave him\r\ngoose-flesh to think of the season\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive cheerfulness, and in\r\nhis desire to avoid the obvious he determined to travel on Christmas\r\nEve.\r\n\r\nPhilip was not sorry to see him off, for he was a downright person and\r\nit irritated him that anybody should not know his own mind. Though much\r\nunder Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s influence, he would not grant that indecision pointed\r\nto a charming sensitiveness; and he resented the shadow of a sneer with\r\nwhich Hayward looked upon his straight ways. They corresponded. Hayward\r\nwas an admirable letter-writer, and knowing his talent took pains with\r\nhis letters. His temperament was receptive to the beautiful influences\r\nwith which he came in contact, and he was able in his letters from Rome\r\nto put a subtle fragrance of Italy. He thought the city of the ancient\r\nRomans a little vulgar, finding distinction only in the decadence of\r\nthe Empire; but the Rome of the Popes appealed to his sympathy, and in\r\nhis chosen words, quite exquisitely, there appeared a rococo beauty. He\r\nwrote of old church music and the Alban Hills, and of the languor of\r\nincense and the charm of the streets by night, in the rain, when the\r\npavements shone and the light of the street lamps was mysterious.\r\nPerhaps he repeated these admirable letters to various friends. He did\r\nnot know what a troubling effect they had upon Philip; they seemed to\r\nmake his life very humdrum. With the spring Hayward grew dithyrambic.\r\nHe proposed that Philip should come down to Italy. He was wasting his\r\ntime at Heidelberg. The Germans were gross and life there was common;\r\nhow could the soul come to her own in that prim landscape? In Tuscany\r\nthe spring was scattering flowers through the land, and Philip was\r\nnineteen; let him come and they could wander through the mountain towns\r\nof Umbria. Their names sang in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart. And Cacilie too, with\r\nher lover, had gone to Italy. When he thought of them Philip was seized\r\nwith a restlessness he could not account for. He cursed his fate\r\nbecause he had no money to travel, and he knew his uncle would not send\r\nhim more than the fifteen pounds a month which had been agreed upon. He\r\nhad not managed his allowance very well. His pension and the price of\r\nhis lessons left him very little over, and he had found going about\r\nwith Hayward expensive. Hayward had often suggested excursions, a visit\r\nto the play, or a bottle of wine, when Philip had come to the end of\r\nhis month\xe2\x80\x99s money; and with the folly of his age he had been unwilling\r\nto confess he could not afford an extravagance.\r\n\r\nLuckily Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s letters came seldom, and in the intervals Philip\r\nsettled down again to his industrious life. He had matriculated at the\r\nuniversity and attended one or two courses of lectures. Kuno Fischer\r\nwas then at the height of his fame and during the winter had been\r\nlecturing brilliantly on Schopenhauer. It was Philip\xe2\x80\x99s introduction to\r\nphilosophy. He had a practical mind and moved uneasily amid the\r\nabstract; but he found an unexpected fascination in listening to\r\nmetaphysical disquisitions; they made him breathless; it was a little\r\nlike watching a tight-rope dancer doing perilous feats over an abyss;\r\nbut it was very exciting. The pessimism of the subject attracted his\r\nyouth; and he believed that the world he was about to enter was a place\r\nof pitiless woe and of darkness. That made him none the less eager to\r\nenter it; and when, in due course, Mrs. Carey, acting as the\r\ncorrespondent for his guardian\xe2\x80\x99s views, suggested that it was time for\r\nhim to come back to England, he agreed with enthusiasm. He must make up\r\nhis mind now what he meant to do. If he left Heidelberg at the end of\r\nJuly they could talk things over during August, and it would be a good\r\ntime to make arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe date of his departure was settled, and Mrs. Carey wrote to him\r\nagain. She reminded him of Miss Wilkinson, through whose kindness he\r\nhad gone to Frau Erlin\xe2\x80\x99s house at Heidelberg, and told him that she had\r\narranged to spend a few weeks with them at Blackstable. She would be\r\ncrossing from Flushing on such and such a day, and if he travelled at\r\nthe same time he could look after her and come on to Blackstable in her\r\ncompany. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s shyness immediately made him write to say that he\r\ncould not leave till a day or two afterwards. He pictured himself\r\nlooking out for Miss Wilkinson, the embarrassment of going up to her\r\nand asking if it were she (and he might so easily address the wrong\r\nperson and be snubbed), and then the difficulty of knowing whether in\r\nthe train he ought to talk to her or whether he could ignore her and\r\nread his book.\r\n\r\nAt last he left Heidelberg. For three months he had been thinking of\r\nnothing but the future; and he went without regret. He never knew that\r\nhe had been happy there. Fraulein Anna gave him a copy of Der Trompeter\r\nvon Sackingen and in return he presented her with a volume of William\r\nMorris. Very wisely neither of them ever read the other\xe2\x80\x99s present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip was surprised when he saw his uncle and aunt. He had never\r\nnoticed before that they were quite old people. The Vicar received him\r\nwith his usual, not unamiable indifference. He was a little stouter, a\r\nlittle balder, a little grayer. Philip saw how insignificant he was.\r\nHis face was weak and self-indulgent. Aunt Louisa took him in her arms\r\nand kissed him; and tears of happiness flowed down her cheeks. Philip\r\nwas touched and embarrassed; he had not known with what a hungry love\r\nshe cared for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the time has seemed long since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been away, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nShe stroked his hands and looked into his face with glad eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve grown. You\xe2\x80\x99re quite a man now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a very small moustache on his upper lip. He had bought a\r\nrazor and now and then with infinite care shaved the down off his\r\nsmooth chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been so lonely without you.\xe2\x80\x9d And then shyly, with a little break\r\nin her voice, she asked: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are glad to come back to your home,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, rather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so thin that she seemed almost transparent, the arms she put\r\nround his neck were frail bones that reminded you of chicken bones, and\r\nher faded face was oh! so wrinkled. The gray curls which she still wore\r\nin the fashion of her youth gave her a queer, pathetic look; and her\r\nlittle withered body was like an autumn leaf, you felt it might be\r\nblown away by the first sharp wind. Philip realised that they had done\r\nwith life, these two quiet little people: they belonged to a past\r\ngeneration, and they were waiting there patiently, rather stupidly, for\r\ndeath; and he, in his vigour and his youth, thirsting for excitement\r\nand adventure, was appalled at the waste. They had done nothing, and\r\nwhen they went it would be just as if they had never been. He felt a\r\ngreat pity for Aunt Louisa, and he loved her suddenly because she loved\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen Miss Wilkinson, who had kept discreetly out of the way till the\r\nCareys had had a chance of welcoming their nephew, came into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Miss Wilkinson, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Carey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prodigal has returned,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, holding out her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nbrought a rose for the prodigal\xe2\x80\x99s buttonhole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a gay smile she pinned to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s coat the flower she had just\r\npicked in the garden. He blushed and felt foolish. He knew that Miss\r\nWilkinson was the daughter of his Uncle William\xe2\x80\x99s last rector, and he\r\nhad a wide acquaintance with the daughters of clergymen. They wore\r\nill-cut clothes and stout boots. They were generally dressed in black,\r\nfor in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s early years at Blackstable homespuns had not reached\r\nEast Anglia, and the ladies of the clergy did not favour colours. Their\r\nhair was done very untidily, and they smelt aggressively of starched\r\nlinen. They considered the feminine graces unbecoming and looked the\r\nsame whether they were old or young. They bore their religion\r\narrogantly. The closeness of their connection with the church made them\r\nadopt a slightly dictatorial attitude to the rest of mankind.\r\n\r\nMiss Wilkinson was very different. She wore a white muslin gown stamped\r\nwith gay little bunches of flowers, and pointed, high-heeled shoes,\r\nwith open-work stockings. To Philip\xe2\x80\x99s inexperience it seemed that she\r\nwas wonderfully dressed; he did not see that her frock was cheap and\r\nshowy. Her hair was elaborately dressed, with a neat curl in the middle\r\nof the forehead: it was very black, shiny and hard, and it looked as\r\nthough it could never be in the least disarranged. She had large black\r\neyes and her nose was slightly aquiline; in profile she had somewhat\r\nthe look of a bird of prey, but full face she was prepossessing. She\r\nsmiled a great deal, but her mouth was large and when she smiled she\r\ntried to hide her teeth, which were big and rather yellow. But what\r\nembarrassed Philip most was that she was heavily powdered: he had very\r\nstrict views on feminine behaviour and did not think a lady ever\r\npowdered; but of course Miss Wilkinson was a lady because she was a\r\nclergyman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and a clergyman was a gentleman.\r\n\r\nPhilip made up his mind to dislike her thoroughly. She spoke with a\r\nslight French accent; and he did not know why she should, since she had\r\nbeen born and bred in the heart of England. He thought her smile\r\naffected, and the coy sprightliness of her manner irritated him. For\r\ntwo or three days he remained silent and hostile, but Miss Wilkinson\r\napparently did not notice it. She was very affable. She addressed her\r\nconversation almost exclusively to him, and there was something\r\nflattering in the way she appealed constantly to his sane judgment. She\r\nmade him laugh too, and Philip could never resist people who amused\r\nhim: he had a gift now and then of saying neat things; and it was\r\npleasant to have an appreciative listener. Neither the Vicar nor Mrs.\r\nCarey had a sense of humour, and they never laughed at anything he\r\nsaid. As he grew used to Miss Wilkinson, and his shyness left him, he\r\nbegan to like her better; he found the French accent picturesque; and\r\nat a garden party which the doctor gave she was very much better\r\ndressed than anyone else. She wore a blue foulard with large white\r\nspots, and Philip was tickled at the sensation it caused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m certain they think you\xe2\x80\x99re no better than you should be,\xe2\x80\x9d he told\r\nher, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the dream of my life to be taken for an abandoned hussy,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nOne day when Miss Wilkinson was in her room he asked Aunt Louisa how\r\nold she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear, you should never ask a lady\xe2\x80\x99s age; but she\xe2\x80\x99s certainly\r\ntoo old for you to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Vicar gave his slow, obese smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s no chicken, Louisa,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was nearly grown up when we\r\nwere in Lincolnshire, and that was twenty years ago. She wore a pigtail\r\nhanging down her back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may not have been more than ten,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was older than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she was near twenty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, William. Sixteen or seventeen at the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would make her well over thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Miss Wilkinson tripped downstairs, singing a song by\r\nBenjamin Goddard. She had put her hat on, for she and Philip were going\r\nfor a walk, and she held out her hand for him to button her glove. He\r\ndid it awkwardly. He felt embarrassed but gallant. Conversation went\r\neasily between them now, and as they strolled along they talked of all\r\nmanner of things. She told Philip about Berlin, and he told her of his\r\nyear in Heidelberg. As he spoke, things which had appeared of no\r\nimportance gained a new interest: he described the people at Frau\r\nErlin\xe2\x80\x99s house; and to the conversations between Hayward and Weeks,\r\nwhich at the time seemed so significant, he gave a little twist, so\r\nthat they looked absurd. He was flattered at Miss Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite frightened of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so sarcastic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she asked him playfully whether he had not had any love affairs at\r\nHeidelberg. Without thinking, he frankly answered that he had not; but\r\nshe refused to believe him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow secretive you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt your age is it likely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe blushed and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know too much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at him blushing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was pleased that she should think he had been a sad dog, and he\r\nchanged the conversation so as to make her believe he had all sorts of\r\nromantic things to conceal. He was angry with himself that he had not.\r\nThere had been no opportunity.\r\n\r\nMiss Wilkinson was dissatisfied with her lot. She resented having to\r\nearn her living and told Philip a long story of an uncle of her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s, who had been expected to leave her a fortune but had married\r\nhis cook and changed his will. She hinted at the luxury of her home and\r\ncompared her life in Lincolnshire, with horses to ride and carriages to\r\ndrive in, with the mean dependence of her present state. Philip was a\r\nlittle puzzled when he mentioned this afterwards to Aunt Louisa, and\r\nshe told him that when she knew the Wilkinsons they had never had\r\nanything more than a pony and a dog-cart; Aunt Louisa had heard of the\r\nrich uncle, but as he was married and had children before Emily was\r\nborn she could never have had much hope of inheriting his fortune. Miss\r\nWilkinson had little good to say of Berlin, where she was now in a\r\nsituation. She complained of the vulgarity of German life, and compared\r\nit bitterly with the brilliance of Paris, where she had spent a number\r\nof years. She did not say how many. She had been governess in the\r\nfamily of a fashionable portrait-painter, who had married a Jewish wife\r\nof means, and in their house she had met many distinguished people. She\r\ndazzled Philip with their names. Actors from the Comedie Francaise had\r\ncome to the house frequently, and Coquelin, sitting next her at dinner,\r\nhad told her he had never met a foreigner who spoke such perfect\r\nFrench. Alphonse Daudet had come also, and he had given her a copy of\r\nSappho: he had promised to write her name in it, but she had forgotten\r\nto remind him. She treasured the volume none the less and she would\r\nlend it to Philip. Then there was Maupassant. Miss Wilkinson with a\r\nrippling laugh looked at Philip knowingly. What a man, but what a\r\nwriter! Hayward had talked of Maupassant, and his reputation was not\r\nunknown to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he make love to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to stick funnily in his throat, but he asked them\r\nnevertheless. He liked Miss Wilkinson very much now, and was thrilled\r\nby her conversation, but he could not imagine anyone making love to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a question!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Guy, he made love to every woman he\r\nmet. It was a habit that he could not break himself of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed a little, and seemed to look back tenderly on the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a charming man,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nA greater experience than Philip\xe2\x80\x99s would have guessed from these words\r\nthe probabilities of the encounter: the distinguished writer invited to\r\nluncheon en famille, the governess coming in sedately with the two tall\r\ngirls she was teaching; the introduction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotre Miss Anglaise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the luncheon during which the Miss Anglaise sat silent while the\r\ndistinguished writer talked to his host and hostess.\r\n\r\nBut to Philip her words called up much more romantic fancies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me all about him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said excitedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to tell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said truthfully, but in such a manner as\r\nto convey that three volumes would scarcely have contained the lurid\r\nfacts. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to talk of Paris. She loved the boulevards and the Bois.\r\nThere was grace in every street, and the trees in the Champs Elysees\r\nhad a distinction which trees had not elsewhere. They were sitting on a\r\nstile now by the high-road, and Miss Wilkinson looked with disdain upon\r\nthe stately elms in front of them. And the theatres: the plays were\r\nbrilliant, and the acting was incomparable. She often went with Madame\r\nFoyot, the mother of the girls she was educating, when she was trying\r\non clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a misery to be poor!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThese beautiful things,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s only in Paris they know how to dress, and not to be able to afford\r\nthem! Poor Madame Foyot, she had no figure. Sometimes the dressmaker\r\nused to whisper to me: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, Mademoiselle, if she only had your\r\nfigure.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip noticed then that Miss Wilkinson had a robust form and was proud\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen are so stupid in England. They only think of the face. The French,\r\nwho are a nation of lovers, know how much more important the figure\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had never thought of such things before, but he observed now\r\nthat Miss Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s ankles were thick and ungainly. He withdrew his\r\neyes quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should go to France. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go to Paris for a year? You\r\nwould learn French, and it would\xe2\x80\x94deniaiser you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\nShe laughed slyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must look it out in the dictionary. Englishmen do not know how to\r\ntreat women. They are so shy. Shyness is ridiculous in a man. They\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to make love. They can\xe2\x80\x99t even tell a woman she is\r\ncharming without looking foolish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt himself absurd. Miss Wilkinson evidently expected him to\r\nbehave very differently; and he would have been delighted to say\r\ngallant and witty things, but they never occurred to him; and when they\r\ndid he was too much afraid of making a fool of himself to say them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I love Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Miss Wilkinson. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I had to go to Berlin.\r\nI was with the Foyots till the girls married, and then I could get\r\nnothing to do, and I had the chance of this post in Berlin. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nrelations of Madame Foyot, and I accepted. I had a tiny apartment in\r\nthe Rue Breda, on the cinquieme: it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all respectable. You know\r\nabout the Rue Breda\xe2\x80\x94ces dames, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip nodded, not knowing at all what she meant, but vaguely\r\nsuspecting, and anxious she should not think him too ignorant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care. Je suis libre, n\xe2\x80\x99est-ce pas?\xe2\x80\x9d She was very fond of\r\nspeaking French, which indeed she spoke well. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce I had such a\r\ncurious adventure there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused a little and Philip pressed her to tell it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me yours in Heidelberg,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were so unadventurous,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Mrs. Carey would say if she knew the sort of things\r\nwe talk about together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I shall tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had done this, she told him how an art-student who had a room\r\non the floor above her\xe2\x80\x94but she interrupted herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go in for art? You paint so prettily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot well enough for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is for others to judge. Je m\xe2\x80\x99y connais, and I believe you have\r\nthe making of a great artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see Uncle William\xe2\x80\x99s face if I suddenly told him I wanted to\r\ngo to Paris and study art?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re your own master, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re trying to put me off. Please go on with the story.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nWilkinson, with a little laugh, went on. The art-student had passed her\r\nseveral times on the stairs, and she had paid no particular attention.\r\nShe saw that he had fine eyes, and he took off his hat very politely.\r\nAnd one day she found a letter slipped under her door. It was from him.\r\nHe told her that he had adored her for months, and that he waited about\r\nthe stairs for her to pass. Oh, it was a charming letter! Of course she\r\ndid not reply, but what woman could help being flattered? And next day\r\nthere was another letter! It was wonderful, passionate, and touching.\r\nWhen next she met him on the stairs she did not know which way to look.\r\nAnd every day the letters came, and now he begged her to see him. He\r\nsaid he would come in the evening, vers neuf heures, and she did not\r\nknow what to do. Of course it was impossible, and he might ring and\r\nring, but she would never open the door; and then while she was waiting\r\nfor the tinkling of the bell, all nerves, suddenly he stood before her.\r\nShe had forgotten to shut the door when she came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99etait une fatalite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what happened then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the end of the story,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with a ripple of laughter.\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent for a moment. His heart beat quickly, and strange\r\nemotions seemed to be hustling one another in his heart. He saw the\r\ndark staircase and the chance meetings, and he admired the boldness of\r\nthe letters\xe2\x80\x94oh, he would never have dared to do that\xe2\x80\x94and then the\r\nsilent, almost mysterious entrance. It seemed to him the very soul of\r\nromance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he was handsome. Charmant garcon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt a slight feeling of irritation as he asked this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe treated me abominably. Men are always the same. You\xe2\x80\x99re heartless,\r\nall of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, not without embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Wilkinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip could not get Miss Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s story out of his head. It was\r\nclear enough what she meant even though she cut it short, and he was a\r\nlittle shocked. That sort of thing was all very well for married women,\r\nhe had read enough French novels to know that in France it was indeed\r\nthe rule, but Miss Wilkinson was English and unmarried; her father was\r\na clergyman. Then it struck him that the art-student probably was\r\nneither the first nor the last of her lovers, and he gasped: he had\r\nnever looked upon Miss Wilkinson like that; it seemed incredible that\r\nanyone should make love to her. In his ingenuousness he doubted her\r\nstory as little as he doubted what he read in books, and he was angry\r\nthat such wonderful things never happened to him. It was humiliating\r\nthat if Miss Wilkinson insisted upon his telling her of his adventures\r\nin Heidelberg he would have nothing to tell. It was true that he had\r\nsome power of invention, but he was not sure whether he could persuade\r\nher that he was steeped in vice; women were full of intuition, he had\r\nread that, and she might easily discover that he was fibbing. He\r\nblushed scarlet as he thought of her laughing up her sleeve.\r\n\r\nMiss Wilkinson played the piano and sang in a rather tired voice; but\r\nher songs, Massenet, Benjamin Goddard, and Augusta Holmes, were new to\r\nPhilip; and together they spent many hours at the piano. One day she\r\nwondered if he had a voice and insisted on trying it. She told him he\r\nhad a pleasant baritone and offered to give him lessons. At first with\r\nhis usual bashfulness he refused, but she insisted, and then every\r\nmorning at a convenient time after breakfast she gave him an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlesson. She had a natural gift for teaching, and it was clear that she\r\nwas an excellent governess. She had method and firmness. Though her\r\nFrench accent was so much part of her that it remained, all the\r\nmellifluousness of her manner left her when she was engaged in\r\nteaching. She put up with no nonsense. Her voice became a little\r\nperemptory, and instinctively she suppressed inattention and corrected\r\nslovenliness. She knew what she was about and put Philip to scales and\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nWhen the lesson was over she resumed without effort her seductive\r\nsmiles, her voice became again soft and winning, but Philip could not\r\nso easily put away the pupil as she the pedagogue; and this impression\r\nconvicted with the feelings her stories had aroused in him. He looked\r\nat her more narrowly. He liked her much better in the evening than in\r\nthe morning. In the morning she was rather lined and the skin of her\r\nneck was just a little rough. He wished she would hide it, but the\r\nweather was very warm just then and she wore blouses which were cut\r\nlow. She was very fond of white; in the morning it did not suit her. At\r\nnight she often looked very attractive, she put on a gown which was\r\nalmost a dinner dress, and she wore a chain of garnets round her neck;\r\nthe lace about her bosom and at her elbows gave her a pleasant\r\nsoftness, and the scent she wore (at Blackstable no one used anything\r\nbut Eau de Cologne, and that only on Sundays or when suffering from a\r\nsick headache) was troubling and exotic. She really looked very young\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nPhilip was much exercised over her age. He added twenty and seventeen\r\ntogether, and could not bring them to a satisfactory total. He asked\r\nAunt Louisa more than once why she thought Miss Wilkinson was\r\nthirty-seven: she didn\xe2\x80\x99t look more than thirty, and everyone knew that\r\nforeigners aged more rapidly than English women; Miss Wilkinson had\r\nlived so long abroad that she might almost be called a foreigner. He\r\npersonally wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought her more than twenty-six.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Louisa.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not believe in the accuracy of the Careys\xe2\x80\x99 statements. All\r\nthey distinctly remembered was that Miss Wilkinson had not got her hair\r\nup the last time they saw her in Lincolnshire. Well, she might have\r\nbeen twelve then: it was so long ago and the Vicar was always so\r\nunreliable. They said it was twenty years ago, but people used round\r\nfigures, and it was just as likely to be eighteen years, or seventeen.\r\nSeventeen and twelve were only twenty-nine, and hang it all, that\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t old, was it? Cleopatra was forty-eight when Antony threw away\r\nthe world for her sake.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine summer. Day after day was hot and cloudless; but the heat\r\nwas tempered by the neighbourhood of the sea, and there was a pleasant\r\nexhilaration in the air, so that one was excited and not oppressed by\r\nthe August sunshine. There was a pond in the garden in which a fountain\r\nplayed; water lilies grew in it and gold fish sunned themselves on the\r\nsurface. Philip and Miss Wilkinson used to take rugs and cushions there\r\nafter dinner and lie on the lawn in the shade of a tall hedge of roses.\r\nThey talked and read all the afternoon. They smoked cigarettes, which\r\nthe Vicar did not allow in the house; he thought smoking a disgusting\r\nhabit, and used frequently to say that it was disgraceful for anyone to\r\ngrow a slave to a habit. He forgot that he was himself a slave to\r\nafternoon tea.\r\n\r\nOne day Miss Wilkinson gave Philip La Vie de Boheme. She had found it\r\nby accident when she was rummaging among the books in the Vicar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy. It had been bought in a lot with something Mr. Carey wanted and\r\nhad remained undiscovered for ten years.\r\n\r\nPhilip began to read Murger\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating, ill-written, absurd\r\nmasterpiece, and fell at once under its spell. His soul danced with joy\r\nat that picture of starvation which is so good-humoured, of squalor\r\nwhich is so picturesque, of sordid love which is so romantic, of bathos\r\nwhich is so moving. Rodolphe and Mimi, Musette and Schaunard! They\r\nwander through the gray streets of the Latin Quarter, finding refuge\r\nnow in one attic, now in another, in their quaint costumes of Louis\r\nPhilippe, with their tears and their smiles, happy-go-lucky and\r\nreckless. Who can resist them? It is only when you return to the book\r\nwith a sounder judgment that you find how gross their pleasures were,\r\nhow vulgar their minds; and you feel the utter worthlessness, as\r\nartists and as human beings, of that gay procession. Philip was\r\nenraptured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you wish you were going to Paris instead of London?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss\r\nWilkinson, smiling at his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late now even if I did,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nDuring the fortnight he had been back from Germany there had been much\r\ndiscussion between himself and his uncle about his future. He had\r\nrefused definitely to go to Oxford, and now that there was no chance of\r\nhis getting scholarships even Mr. Carey came to the conclusion that he\r\ncould not afford it. His entire fortune had consisted of only two\r\nthousand pounds, and though it had been invested in mortgages at five\r\nper cent, he had not been able to live on the interest. It was now a\r\nlittle reduced. It would be absurd to spend two hundred a year, the\r\nleast he could live on at a university, for three years at Oxford which\r\nwould lead him no nearer to earning his living. He was anxious to go\r\nstraight to London. Mrs. Carey thought there were only four professions\r\nfor a gentleman, the Army, the Navy, the Law, and the Church. She had\r\nadded medicine because her brother-in-law practised it, but did not\r\nforget that in her young days no one ever considered the doctor a\r\ngentleman. The first two were out of the question, and Philip was firm\r\nin his refusal to be ordained. Only the law remained. The local doctor\r\nhad suggested that many gentlemen now went in for engineering, but Mrs.\r\nCarey opposed the idea at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like Philip to go into trade,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he must have a profession,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Vicar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not make him a doctor like his father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hate it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey was not sorry. The Bar seemed out of the question, since he\r\nwas not going to Oxford, for the Careys were under the impression that\r\na degree was still necessary for success in that calling; and finally\r\nit was suggested that he should become articled to a solicitor. They\r\nwrote to the family lawyer, Albert Nixon, who was co-executor with the\r\nVicar of Blackstable for the late Henry Carey\xe2\x80\x99s estate, and asked him\r\nwhether he would take Philip. In a day or two the answer came back that\r\nhe had not a vacancy, and was very much opposed to the whole scheme;\r\nthe profession was greatly overcrowded, and without capital or\r\nconnections a man had small chance of becoming more than a managing\r\nclerk; he suggested, however, that Philip should become a chartered\r\naccountant. Neither the Vicar nor his wife knew in the least what this\r\nwas, and Philip had never heard of anyone being a chartered accountant;\r\nbut another letter from the solicitor explained that the growth of\r\nmodern businesses and the increase of companies had led to the\r\nformation of many firms of accountants to examine the books and put\r\ninto the financial affairs of their clients an order which\r\nold-fashioned methods had lacked. Some years before a Royal Charter had\r\nbeen obtained, and the profession was becoming every year more\r\nrespectable, lucrative, and important. The chartered accountants whom\r\nAlbert Nixon had employed for thirty years happened to have a vacancy\r\nfor an articled pupil, and would take Philip for a fee of three hundred\r\npounds. Half of this would be returned during the five years the\r\narticles lasted in the form of salary. The prospect was not exciting,\r\nbut Philip felt that he must decide on something, and the thought of\r\nliving in London over-balanced the slight shrinking he felt. The Vicar\r\nof Blackstable wrote to ask Mr. Nixon whether it was a profession\r\nsuited to a gentleman; and Mr. Nixon replied that, since the Charter,\r\nmen were going into it who had been to public schools and a university;\r\nmoreover, if Philip disliked the work and after a year wished to leave,\r\nHerbert Carter, for that was the accountant\xe2\x80\x99s name, would return half\r\nthe money paid for the articles. This settled it, and it was arranged\r\nthat Philip should start work on the fifteenth of September.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a full month before me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you go to freedom and I to bondage,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Wilkinson.\r\n\r\nHer holidays were to last six weeks, and she would be leaving\r\nBlackstable only a day or two before Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if we shall ever meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak in that practical way. I never knew anyone so\r\nunsentimental.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened. He was afraid that Miss Wilkinson would think him a\r\nmilksop: after all she was a young woman, sometimes quite pretty, and\r\nhe was getting on for twenty; it was absurd that they should talk of\r\nnothing but art and literature. He ought to make love to her. They had\r\ntalked a good deal of love. There was the art-student in the Rue Breda,\r\nand then there was the painter in whose family she had lived so long in\r\nParis: he had asked her to sit for him, and had started to make love to\r\nher so violently that she was forced to invent excuses not to sit to\r\nhim again. It was clear enough that Miss Wilkinson was used to\r\nattentions of that sort. She looked very nice now in a large straw hat:\r\nit was hot that afternoon, the hottest day they had had, and beads of\r\nsweat stood in a line on her upper lip. He called to mind Fraulein\r\nCacilie and Herr Sung. He had never thought of Cacilie in an amorous\r\nway, she was exceedingly plain; but now, looking back, the affair\r\nseemed very romantic. He had a chance of romance too. Miss Wilkinson\r\nwas practically French, and that added zest to a possible adventure.\r\nWhen he thought of it at night in bed, or when he sat by himself in the\r\ngarden reading a book, he was thrilled by it; but when he saw Miss\r\nWilkinson it seemed less picturesque.\r\n\r\nAt all events, after what she had told him, she would not be surprised\r\nif he made love to her. He had a feeling that she must think it odd of\r\nhim to make no sign: perhaps it was only his fancy, but once or twice\r\nin the last day or two he had imagined that there was a suspicion of\r\ncontempt in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA penny for your thoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Wilkinson, looking at him with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking that he ought to kiss her there and then. He wondered\r\nif she expected him to do it; but after all he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see how he could\r\nwithout any preliminary business at all. She would just think him mad,\r\nor she might slap his face; and perhaps she would complain to his\r\nuncle. He wondered how Herr Sung had started with Fraulein Cacilie. It\r\nwould be beastly if she told his uncle: he knew what his uncle was, he\r\nwould tell the doctor and Josiah Graves; and he would look a perfect\r\nfool. Aunt Louisa kept on saying that Miss Wilkinson was thirty-seven\r\nif she was a day; he shuddered at the thought of the ridicule he would\r\nbe exposed to; they would say she was old enough to be his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwopence for your thoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Miss Wilkinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered boldly.\r\n\r\nThat at all events committed him to nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now you want to know too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaughty boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Wilkinson.\r\n\r\nThere it was again! Whenever he had succeeded in working himself up she\r\nsaid something which reminded him of the governess. She called him\r\nplayfully a naughty boy when he did not sing his exercises to her\r\nsatisfaction. This time he grew quite sulky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t treat me as if I were a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you cross?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand and he took it. Once or twice lately when they\r\nshook hands at night he had fancied she slightly pressed his hand, but\r\nthis time there was no doubt about it.\r\n\r\nHe did not quite know what he ought to say next. Here at last was his\r\nchance of an adventure, and he would be a fool not to take it; but it\r\nwas a little ordinary, and he had expected more glamour. He had read\r\nmany descriptions of love, and he felt in himself none of that uprush\r\nof emotion which novelists described; he was not carried off his feet\r\nin wave upon wave of passion; nor was Miss Wilkinson the ideal: he had\r\noften pictured to himself the great violet eyes and the alabaster skin\r\nof some lovely girl, and he had thought of himself burying his face in\r\nthe rippling masses of her auburn hair. He could not imagine himself\r\nburying his face in Miss Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s hair, it always struck him as a\r\nlittle sticky. All the same it would be very satisfactory to have an\r\nintrigue, and he thrilled with the legitimate pride he would enjoy in\r\nhis conquest. He owed it to himself to seduce her. He made up his mind\r\nto kiss Miss Wilkinson; not then, but in the evening; it would be\r\neasier in the dark, and after he had kissed her the rest would follow.\r\nHe would kiss her that very evening. He swore an oath to that effect.\r\n\r\nHe laid his plans. After supper he suggested that they should take a\r\nstroll in the garden. Miss Wilkinson accepted, and they sauntered side\r\nby side. Philip was very nervous. He did not know why, but the\r\nconversation would not lead in the right direction; he had decided that\r\nthe first thing to do was to put his arm round her waist; but he could\r\nnot suddenly put his arm round her waist when she was talking of the\r\nregatta which was to be held next week. He led her artfully into the\r\ndarkest parts of the garden, but having arrived there his courage\r\nfailed him. They sat on a bench, and he had really made up his mind\r\nthat here was his opportunity when Miss Wilkinson said she was sure\r\nthere were earwigs and insisted on moving. They walked round the garden\r\nonce more, and Philip promised himself he would take the plunge before\r\nthey arrived at that bench again; but as they passed the house, they\r\nsaw Mrs. Carey standing at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t you young people better come in? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the night air isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngood for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we had better go in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to catch\r\ncold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it with a sigh of relief. He could attempt nothing more that\r\nnight. But afterwards, when he was alone in his room, he was furious\r\nwith himself. He had been a perfect fool. He was certain that Miss\r\nWilkinson expected him to kiss her, otherwise she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come\r\ninto the garden. She was always saying that only Frenchmen knew how to\r\ntreat women. Philip had read French novels. If he had been a Frenchman\r\nhe would have seized her in his arms and told her passionately that he\r\nadored her; he would have pressed his lips on her nuque. He did not\r\nknow why Frenchmen always kissed ladies on the nuque. He did not\r\nhimself see anything so very attractive in the nape of the neck. Of\r\ncourse it was much easier for Frenchmen to do these things; the\r\nlanguage was such an aid; Philip could never help feeling that to say\r\npassionate things in English sounded a little absurd. He wished now\r\nthat he had never undertaken the siege of Miss Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s virtue; the\r\nfirst fortnight had been so jolly, and now he was wretched; but he was\r\ndetermined not to give in, he would never respect himself again if he\r\ndid, and he made up his mind irrevocably that the next night he would\r\nkiss her without fail.\r\n\r\nNext day when he got up he saw it was raining, and his first thought\r\nwas that they would not be able to go into the garden that evening. He\r\nwas in high spirits at breakfast. Miss Wilkinson sent Mary Ann in to\r\nsay that she had a headache and would remain in bed. She did not come\r\ndown till tea-time, when she appeared in a becoming wrapper and a pale\r\nface; but she was quite recovered by supper, and the meal was very\r\ncheerful. After prayers she said she would go straight to bed, and she\r\nkissed Mrs. Carey. Then she turned to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to kiss you too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and held out her hand. She distinctly pressed his.\r\n\r\nThe following day there was not a cloud in the sky, and the garden was\r\nsweet and fresh after the rain. Philip went down to the beach to bathe\r\nand when he came home ate a magnificent dinner. They were having a\r\ntennis party at the vicarage in the afternoon and Miss Wilkinson put on\r\nher best dress. She certainly knew how to wear her clothes, and Philip\r\ncould not help noticing how elegant she looked beside the curate\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nand the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s married daughter. There were two roses in her\r\nwaistband. She sat in a garden chair by the side of the lawn, holding a\r\nred parasol over herself, and the light on her face was very becoming.\r\nPhilip was fond of tennis. He served well and as he ran clumsily played\r\nclose to the net: notwithstanding his club-foot he was quick, and it\r\nwas difficult to get a ball past him. He was pleased because he won all\r\nhis sets. At tea he lay down at Miss Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s feet, hot and panting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlannels suit you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look very nice this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe blushed with delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can honestly return the compliment. You look perfectly ravishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled and gave him a long look with her black eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter supper he insisted that she should come out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you had enough exercise for one day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be lovely in the garden tonight. The stars are all out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was in high spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know, Mrs. Carey has been scolding me on your account?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Wilkinson, when they were sauntering through the kitchen garden.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t flirt with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been flirting with me? I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was only joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very unkind of you to refuse to kiss me last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you saw the look your uncle gave me when I said what I did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that all that prevented you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer to kiss people without witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no witnesses now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip put his arm round her waist and kissed her lips. She only\r\nlaughed a little and made no attempt to withdraw. It had come quite\r\nnaturally. Philip was very proud of himself. He said he would, and he\r\nhad. It was the easiest thing in the world. He wished he had done it\r\nbefore. He did it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I like it,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day after dinner they took their rugs and cushions to the\r\nfountain, and their books; but they did not read. Miss Wilkinson made\r\nherself comfortable and she opened the red sun-shade. Philip was not at\r\nall shy now, but at first she would not let him kiss her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very wrong of me last night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, I\r\nfelt I\xe2\x80\x99d done so wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you slept like a top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think your uncle would say if he knew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why he should know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned over her, and his heart went pit-a-pat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy d\xe2\x80\x99you want to kiss me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew he ought to reply: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d But he could not bring\r\nhimself to say it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked instead.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with smiling eyes and touched his face with the tips\r\nof her fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow smooth your face is,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want shaving awfully,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing how difficult he found it to make romantic speeches.\r\nHe found that silence helped him much more than words. He could look\r\ninexpressible things. Miss Wilkinson sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like me at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, awfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he tried to kiss her again she did not resist. He pretended to be\r\nmuch more passionate than he really was, and he succeeded in playing a\r\npart which looked very well in his own eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to be rather frightened of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Wilkinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come out after supper, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he begged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot unless you promise to behave yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll promise anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was catching fire from the flame he was partly simulating, and at\r\ntea-time he was obstreperously merry. Miss Wilkinson looked at him\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t have those shining eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him afterwards.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will your Aunt Louisa think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what she thinks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Wilkinson gave a little laugh of pleasure. They had no sooner\r\nfinished supper than he said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to keep me company while I smoke a cigarette?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you let Miss Wilkinson rest?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Carey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nremember she\xe2\x80\x99s not as young as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go out, Mrs. Carey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rather acidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter dinner walk a mile, after supper rest a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour aunt is very nice, but she gets on my nerves sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Wilkinson, as soon as they closed the side-door behind them.\r\n\r\nPhilip threw away the cigarette he had just lighted, and flung his arms\r\nround her. She tried to push him away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised you\xe2\x80\x99d be good, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I was going to keep a promise like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so near the house, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing someone should\r\ncome out suddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led her to the kitchen garden where no one was likely to come, and\r\nthis time Miss Wilkinson did not think of earwigs. He kissed her\r\npassionately. It was one of the things that puzzled him that he did not\r\nlike her at all in the morning, and only moderately in the afternoon,\r\nbut at night the touch of her hand thrilled him. He said things that he\r\nwould never have thought himself capable of saying; he could certainly\r\nnever have said them in the broad light of day; and he listened to\r\nhimself with wonder and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautifully you make love,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThat was what he thought himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I could only say all the things that burn my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured passionately.\r\n\r\nIt was splendid. It was the most thrilling game he had ever played; and\r\nthe wonderful thing was that he felt almost all he said. It was only\r\nthat he exaggerated a little. He was tremendously interested and\r\nexcited in the effect he could see it had on her. It was obviously with\r\nan effort that at last she suggested going in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t go yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a sudden intuition what was the right thing to do then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go in yet. I shall stay here and think. My cheeks are burning.\r\nI want the night-air. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand seriously, and she took it in silence. He thought\r\nshe stifled a sob. Oh, it was magnificent! When, after a decent\r\ninterval during which he had been rather bored in the dark garden by\r\nhimself, he went in he found that Miss Wilkinson had already gone to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nAfter that things were different between them. The next day and the day\r\nafter Philip showed himself an eager lover. He was deliciously\r\nflattered to discover that Miss Wilkinson was in love with him: she\r\ntold him so in English, and she told him so in French. She paid him\r\ncompliments. No one had ever informed him before that his eyes were\r\ncharming and that he had a sensual mouth. He had never bothered much\r\nabout his personal appearance, but now, when occasion presented, he\r\nlooked at himself in the glass with satisfaction. When he kissed her it\r\nwas wonderful to feel the passion that seemed to thrill her soul. He\r\nkissed her a good deal, for he found it easier to do that than to say\r\nthe things he instinctively felt she expected of him. It still made him\r\nfeel a fool to say he worshipped her. He wished there were someone to\r\nwhom he could boast a little, and he would willingly have discussed\r\nminute points of his conduct. Sometimes she said things that were\r\nenigmatic, and he was puzzled. He wished Hayward had been there so that\r\nhe could ask him what he thought she meant, and what he had better do\r\nnext. He could not make up his mind whether he ought to rush things or\r\nlet them take their time. There were only three weeks more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt breaks my heart. And\r\nthen perhaps we shall never see one another again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you cared for me at all, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so unkind to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why can\xe2\x80\x99t you be content to let it go on as it is? Men are always\r\nthe same. They\xe2\x80\x99re never satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when he pressed her, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you see it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible. How can we here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe proposed all sorts of schemes, but she would not have anything to do\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daren\xe2\x80\x99t take the risk. It would be too dreadful if your aunt found\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA day or two later he had an idea which seemed brilliant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, if you had a headache on Sunday evening and offered to stay\r\nat home and look after the house, Aunt Louisa would go to church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGenerally Mrs. Carey remained in on Sunday evening in order to allow\r\nMary Ann to go to church, but she would welcome the opportunity of\r\nattending evensong.\r\n\r\nPhilip had not found it necessary to impart to his relations the change\r\nin his views on Christianity which had occurred in Germany; they could\r\nnot be expected to understand; and it seemed less trouble to go to\r\nchurch quietly. But he only went in the morning. He regarded this as a\r\ngraceful concession to the prejudices of society and his refusal to go\r\na second time as an adequate assertion of free thought.\r\n\r\nWhen he made the suggestion, Miss Wilkinson did not speak for a moment,\r\nthen shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nBut on Sunday at tea-time she surprised Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome to church this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve really got a\r\ndreadful headache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey, much concerned, insisted on giving her some \xe2\x80\x98drops\xe2\x80\x99 which\r\nshe was herself in the habit of using. Miss Wilkinson thanked her, and\r\nimmediately after tea announced that she would go to her room and lie\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you\xe2\x80\x99ll want?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Carey anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to church. I don\xe2\x80\x99t often have\r\nthe chance of going in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, do go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss Wilkinson wants anything, she\r\ncan always call me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better leave the drawing-room door open, Philip, so that if Miss\r\nWilkinson rings, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nSo after six o\xe2\x80\x99clock Philip was left alone in the house with Miss\r\nWilkinson. He felt sick with apprehension. He wished with all his heart\r\nthat he had not suggested the plan; but it was too late now; he must\r\ntake the opportunity which he had made. What would Miss Wilkinson think\r\nof him if he did not! He went into the hall and listened. There was not\r\na sound. He wondered if Miss Wilkinson really had a headache. Perhaps\r\nshe had forgotten his suggestion. His heart beat painfully. He crept up\r\nthe stairs as softly as he could, and he stopped with a start when they\r\ncreaked. He stood outside Miss Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s room and listened; he put\r\nhis hand on the knob of the door-handle. He waited. It seemed to him\r\nthat he waited for at least five minutes, trying to make up his mind;\r\nand his hand trembled. He would willingly have bolted, but he was\r\nafraid of the remorse which he knew would seize him. It was like\r\ngetting on the highest diving-board in a swimming-bath; it looked\r\nnothing from below, but when you got up there and stared down at the\r\nwater your heart sank; and the only thing that forced you to dive was\r\nthe shame of coming down meekly by the steps you had climbed up. Philip\r\nscrewed up his courage. He turned the handle softly and walked in. He\r\nseemed to himself to be trembling like a leaf.\r\n\r\nMiss Wilkinson was standing at the dressing-table with her back to the\r\ndoor, and she turned round quickly when she heard it open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you. What d\xe2\x80\x99you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had taken off her skirt and blouse, and was standing in her\r\npetticoat. It was short and only came down to the top of her boots; the\r\nupper part of it was black, of some shiny material, and there was a red\r\nflounce. She wore a camisole of white calico with short arms. She\r\nlooked grotesque. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank as he stared at her; she had\r\nnever seemed so unattractive; but it was too late now. He closed the\r\ndoor behind him and locked it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip woke early next morning. His sleep had been restless; but when\r\nhe stretched his legs and looked at the sunshine that slid through the\r\nVenetian blinds, making patterns on the floor, he sighed with\r\nsatisfaction. He was delighted with himself. He began to think of Miss\r\nWilkinson. She had asked him to call her Emily, but, he knew not why,\r\nhe could not; he always thought of her as Miss Wilkinson. Since she\r\nchid him for so addressing her, he avoided using her name at all.\r\nDuring his childhood he had often heard a sister of Aunt Louisa, the\r\nwidow of a naval officer, spoken of as Aunt Emily. It made him\r\nuncomfortable to call Miss Wilkinson by that name, nor could he think\r\nof any that would have suited her better. She had begun as Miss\r\nWilkinson, and it seemed inseparable from his impression of her. He\r\nfrowned a little: somehow or other he saw her now at her worst; he\r\ncould not forget his dismay when she turned round and he saw her in her\r\ncamisole and the short petticoat; he remembered the slight roughness of\r\nher skin and the sharp, long lines on the side of the neck. His triumph\r\nwas short-lived. He reckoned out her age again, and he did not see how\r\nshe could be less than forty. It made the affair ridiculous. She was\r\nplain and old. His quick fancy showed her to him, wrinkled, haggard,\r\nmade-up, in those frocks which were too showy for her position and too\r\nyoung for her years. He shuddered; he felt suddenly that he never\r\nwanted to see her again; he could not bear the thought of kissing her.\r\nHe was horrified with himself. Was that love?\r\n\r\nHe took as long as he could over dressing in order to put back the\r\nmoment of seeing her, and when at last he went into the dining-room it\r\nwas with a sinking heart. Prayers were over, and they were sitting down\r\nat breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLazybones,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Wilkinson cried gaily.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her and gave a little gasp of relief. She was sitting with\r\nher back to the window. She was really quite nice. He wondered why he\r\nhad thought such things about her. His self-satisfaction returned to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe was taken aback by the change in her. She told him in a voice\r\nthrilling with emotion immediately after breakfast that she loved him;\r\nand when a little later they went into the drawing-room for his singing\r\nlesson and she sat down on the music-stool she put up her face in the\r\nmiddle of a scale and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmbrasse-moi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he bent down she flung her arms round his neck. It was slightly\r\nuncomfortable, for she held him in such a position that he felt rather\r\nchoked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, je t\xe2\x80\x99aime. Je t\xe2\x80\x99aime. Je t\xe2\x80\x99aime,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with her\r\nextravagantly French accent.\r\n\r\nPhilip wished she would speak English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s struck you that the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nlikely to pass the window any minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, je m\xe2\x80\x99en fiche du jardinier. Je m\xe2\x80\x99en refiche, et je m\xe2\x80\x99en\r\ncontrefiche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thought it was very like a French novel, and he did not know why\r\nit slightly irritated him.\r\n\r\nAt last he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll tootle along to the beach and have a dip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to leave me this morning\xe2\x80\x94of all mornings?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip\r\ndid not quite know why he should not, but it did not matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to stay?\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you darling! But no, go. Go. I want to think of you mastering the\r\nsalt sea waves, bathing your limbs in the broad ocean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got his hat and sauntered off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat rot women talk!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself.\r\n\r\nBut he was pleased and happy and flattered. She was evidently\r\nfrightfully gone on him. As he limped along the high street of\r\nBlackstable he looked with a tinge of superciliousness at the people he\r\npassed. He knew a good many to nod to, and as he gave them a smile of\r\nrecognition he thought to himself, if they only knew! He did want\r\nsomeone to know very badly. He thought he would write to Hayward, and\r\nin his mind composed the letter. He would talk of the garden and the\r\nroses, and the little French governess, like an exotic flower amongst\r\nthem, scented and perverse: he would say she was French, because\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nshe had lived in France so long that she almost was, and besides it\r\nwould be shabby to give the whole thing away too exactly, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow; and he would tell Hayward how he had seen her first in her pretty\r\nmuslin dress and of the flower she had given him. He made a delicate\r\nidyl of it: the sunshine and the sea gave it passion and magic, and the\r\nstars added poetry, and the old vicarage garden was a fit and exquisite\r\nsetting. There was something Meredithian about it: it was not quite\r\nLucy Feverel and not quite Clara Middleton; but it was inexpressibly\r\ncharming. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat quickly. He was so delighted with his\r\nfancies that he began thinking of them again as soon as he crawled\r\nback, dripping and cold, into his bathing-machine. He thought of the\r\nobject of his affections. She had the most adorable little nose and\r\nlarge brown eyes\xe2\x80\x94he would describe her to Hayward\xe2\x80\x94and masses of soft\r\nbrown hair, the sort of hair it was delicious to bury your face in, and\r\na skin which was like ivory and sunshine, and her cheek was like a red,\r\nred rose. How old was she? Eighteen perhaps, and he called her Musette.\r\nHer laughter was like a rippling brook, and her voice was so soft, so\r\nlow, it was the sweetest music he had ever heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ARE you thinking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip stopped suddenly. He was walking slowly home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been waving at you for the last quarter of a mile. You ARE\r\nabsent-minded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Wilkinson was standing in front of him, laughing at his surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come and meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awfully nice of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I startle you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted.\r\n\r\nHe wrote his letter to Hayward all the same. There were eight pages of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe fortnight that remained passed quickly, and though each evening,\r\nwhen they went into the garden after supper, Miss Wilkinson remarked\r\nthat one day more had gone, Philip was in too cheerful spirits to let\r\nthe thought depress him. One night Miss Wilkinson suggested that it\r\nwould be delightful if she could exchange her situation in Berlin for\r\none in London. Then they could see one another constantly. Philip said\r\nit would be very jolly, but the prospect aroused no enthusiasm in him;\r\nhe was looking forward to a wonderful life in London, and he preferred\r\nnot to be hampered. He spoke a little too freely of all he meant to do,\r\nand allowed Miss Wilkinson to see that already he was longing to be\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that if you loved me,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nHe was taken aback and remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool I\xe2\x80\x99ve been,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise he saw that she was crying. He had a tender heart, and\r\nhated to see anyone miserable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry. What have I done? Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Philip, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean to me. I have\r\nsuch a wretched life, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve made me so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her silently. There really was anguish in her tone, and he\r\nwas frightened. It had never occurred to him that she meant what she\r\nsaid quite, quite seriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry. You know I\xe2\x80\x99m frightfully fond of you. I wish you\r\nwould come to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Places are almost impossible to get, and I hate\r\nEnglish life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost unconscious that he was acting a part, moved by her distress, he\r\npressed her more and more. Her tears vaguely flattered him, and he\r\nkissed her with real passion.\r\n\r\nBut a day or two later she made a real scene. There was a tennis-party\r\nat the vicarage, and two girls came, daughters of a retired major in an\r\nIndian regiment who had lately settled in Blackstable. They were very\r\npretty, one was Philip\xe2\x80\x99s age and the other was a year or two younger.\r\nBeing used to the society of young men (they were full of stories of\r\nhill-stations in India, and at that time the stories of Rudyard Kipling\r\nwere in every hand) they began to chaff Philip gaily; and he, pleased\r\nwith the novelty\xe2\x80\x94the young ladies at Blackstable treated the Vicar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnephew with a certain seriousness\xe2\x80\x94was gay and jolly. Some devil within\r\nhim prompted him to start a violent flirtation with them both, and as\r\nhe was the only young man there, they were quite willing to meet him\r\nhalf-way. It happened that they played tennis quite well and Philip was\r\ntired of pat-ball with Miss Wilkinson (she had only begun to play when\r\nshe came to Blackstable), so when he arranged the sets after tea he\r\nsuggested that Miss Wilkinson should play against the curate\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\nwith the curate as her partner; and he would play later with the\r\nnew-comers. He sat down by the elder Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Connor and said to her in\r\nan undertone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll get the duffers out of the way first, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a\r\njolly set afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently Miss Wilkinson overheard him, for she threw down her racket,\r\nand, saying she had a headache, went away. It was plain to everyone\r\nthat she was offended. Philip was annoyed that she should make the fact\r\npublic. The set was arranged without her, but presently Mrs. Carey\r\ncalled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, you\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt Emily\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. She\xe2\x80\x99s gone to her room and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, something about a duffer\xe2\x80\x99s set. Do go to her, and say you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to be unkind, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knocked at Miss Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s door, but receiving no answer went in.\r\nHe found her lying face downwards on her bed, weeping. He touched her\r\non the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what on earth\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone. I never want to speak to you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done? I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry if I\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt your feelings. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to. I say, do get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so unhappy. How could you be cruel to me? You know I hate that\r\nstupid game. I only play because I want to play with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up and walked towards the dressing-table, but after a quick\r\nlook in the glass sank into a chair. She made her handkerchief into a\r\nball and dabbed her eyes with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve given you the greatest thing a woman can give a man\xe2\x80\x94oh, what a\r\nfool I was\xe2\x80\x94and you have no gratitude. You must be quite heartless. How\r\ncould you be so cruel as to torment me by flirting with those vulgar\r\ngirls. We\xe2\x80\x99ve only got just over a week. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you even give me that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip stood over her rather sulkily. He thought her behaviour\r\nchildish. He was vexed with her for having shown her ill-temper before\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t care twopence about either of the O\xe2\x80\x99Connors. Why\r\non earth should you think I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Wilkinson put away her handkerchief. Her tears had made marks on\r\nher powdered face, and her hair was somewhat disarranged. Her white\r\ndress did not suit her very well just then. She looked at Philip with\r\nhungry, passionate eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99re twenty and so\xe2\x80\x99s she,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened and looked away. The anguish of her tone made him feel\r\nstrangely uneasy. He wished with all his heart that he had never had\r\nanything to do with Miss Wilkinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make you unhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said awkwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better go\r\ndown and look after your friends. They\xe2\x80\x99ll wonder what has become of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was glad to leave her.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel was quickly followed by a reconciliation, but the few days\r\nthat remained were sometimes irksome to Philip. He wanted to talk of\r\nnothing but the future, and the future invariably reduced Miss\r\nWilkinson to tears. At first her weeping affected him, and feeling\r\nhimself a beast he redoubled his protestations of undying passion; but\r\nnow it irritated him: it would have been all very well if she had been\r\na girl, but it was silly of a grown-up woman to cry so much. She never\r\nceased reminding him that he was under a debt of gratitude to her which\r\nhe could never repay. He was willing to acknowledge this since she made\r\na point of it, but he did not really know why he should be any more\r\ngrateful to her than she to him. He was expected to show his sense of\r\nobligation in ways which were rather a nuisance: he had been a good\r\ndeal used to solitude, and it was a necessity to him sometimes; but\r\nMiss Wilkinson looked upon it as an unkindness if he was not always at\r\nher beck and call. The Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Connors asked them both to tea, and\r\nPhilip would have liked to go, but Miss Wilkinson said she only had\r\nfive days more and wanted him entirely to herself. It was flattering,\r\nbut a bore. Miss Wilkinson told him stories of the exquisite delicacy\r\nof Frenchmen when they stood in the same relation to fair ladies as he\r\nto Miss Wilkinson. She praised their courtesy, their passion for\r\nself-sacrifice, their perfect tact. Miss Wilkinson seemed to want a\r\ngreat deal.\r\n\r\nPhilip listened to her enumeration of the qualities which must be\r\npossessed by the perfect lover, and he could not help feeling a certain\r\nsatisfaction that she lived in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will write to me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Write to me every day. I want to know\r\neverything you\xe2\x80\x99re doing. You must keep nothing from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be awfully, busy\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write as often as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flung her arms passionately round his neck. He was embarrassed\r\nsometimes by the demonstrations of her affection. He would have\r\npreferred her to be more passive. It shocked him a little that she\r\nshould give him so marked a lead: it did not tally altogether with his\r\nprepossessions about the modesty of the feminine temperament.\r\n\r\nAt length the day came on which Miss Wilkinson was to go, and she came\r\ndown to breakfast, pale and subdued, in a serviceable travelling dress\r\nof black and white check. She looked a very competent governess. Philip\r\nwas silent too, for he did not quite know what to say that would fit\r\nthe circumstance; and he was terribly afraid that, if he said something\r\nflippant, Miss Wilkinson would break down before his uncle and make a\r\nscene. They had said their last good-bye to one another in the garden\r\nthe night before, and Philip was relieved that there was now no\r\nopportunity for them to be alone. He remained in the dining-room after\r\nbreakfast in case Miss Wilkinson should insist on kissing him on the\r\nstairs. He did not want Mary Ann, now a woman hard upon middle age with\r\na sharp tongue, to catch them in a compromising position. Mary Ann did\r\nnot like Miss Wilkinson and called her an old cat. Aunt Louisa was not\r\nvery well and could not come to the station, but the Vicar and Philip\r\nsaw her off. Just as the train was leaving she leaned out and kissed\r\nMr. Carey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must kiss you too, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, blushing.\r\n\r\nHe stood up on the step and she kissed him quickly. The train started,\r\nand Miss Wilkinson sank into the corner of her carriage and wept\r\ndisconsolately. Philip, as he walked back to the vicarage, felt a\r\ndistinct sensation of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, did you see her safely off?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aunt Louisa, when they got\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she seemed rather weepy. She insisted on kissing me and Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, at her age it\xe2\x80\x99s not dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Carey pointed to the\r\nsideboard. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a letter for you, Philip. It came by the second\r\npost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was from Hayward and ran as follows:\r\n\r\nMy dear boy,\r\n\r\nI answer your letter at once. I ventured to read it to a great friend\r\nof mine, a charming woman whose help and sympathy have been very\r\nprecious to me, a woman withal with a real feeling for art and\r\nliterature; and we agreed that it was charming. You wrote from your\r\nheart and you do not know the delightful naivete which is in every\r\nline. And because you love you write like a poet. Ah, dear boy, that is\r\nthe real thing: I felt the glow of your young passion, and your prose\r\nwas musical from the sincerity of your emotion. You must be happy! I\r\nwish I could have been present unseen in that enchanted garden while\r\nyou wandered hand in hand, like Daphnis and Chloe, amid the flowers. I\r\ncan see you, my Daphnis, with the light of young love in your eyes,\r\ntender, enraptured, and ardent; while Chloe in your arms, so young and\r\nsoft and fresh, vowing she would ne\xe2\x80\x99er consent\xe2\x80\x94consented. Roses and\r\nviolets and honeysuckle! Oh, my friend, I envy you. It is so good to\r\nthink that your first love should have been pure poetry. Treasure the\r\nmoments, for the immortal gods have given you the Greatest Gift of All,\r\nand it will be a sweet, sad memory till your dying day. You will never\r\nagain enjoy that careless rapture. First love is best love; and she is\r\nbeautiful and you are young, and all the world is yours. I felt my\r\npulse go faster when with your adorable simplicity you told me that you\r\nburied your face in her long hair. I am sure that it is that exquisite\r\nchestnut which seems just touched with gold. I would have you sit under\r\na leafy tree side by side, and read together Romeo and Juliet; and then\r\nI would have you fall on your knees and on my behalf kiss the ground on\r\nwhich her foot has left its imprint; then tell her it is the homage of\r\na poet to her radiant youth and to your love for her.\r\nYours always,\r\nG. Etheridge Hayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat damned rot!\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, when he finished the letter.\r\n\r\nMiss Wilkinson oddly enough had suggested that they should read Romeo\r\nand Juliet together; but Philip had firmly declined. Then, as he put\r\nthe letter in his pocket, he felt a queer little pang of bitterness\r\nbecause reality seemed so different from the ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later Philip went to London. The curate had recommended\r\nrooms in Barnes, and these Philip engaged by letter at fourteen\r\nshillings a week. He reached them in the evening; and the landlady, a\r\nfunny little old woman with a shrivelled body and a deeply wrinkled\r\nface, had prepared high tea for him. Most of the sitting-room was taken\r\nup by the sideboard and a square table; against one wall was a sofa\r\ncovered with horsehair, and by the fireplace an arm-chair to match:\r\nthere was a white antimacassar over the back of it, and on the seat,\r\nbecause the springs were broken, a hard cushion.\r\n\r\nAfter having his tea he unpacked and arranged his books, then he sat\r\ndown and tried to read; but he was depressed. The silence in the street\r\nmade him slightly uncomfortable, and he felt very much alone.\r\n\r\nNext day he got up early. He put on his tail-coat and the tall hat\r\nwhich he had worn at school; but it was very shabby, and he made up his\r\nmind to stop at the Stores on his way to the office and buy a new one.\r\nWhen he had done this he found himself in plenty of time and so walked\r\nalong the Strand. The office of Messrs. Herbert Carter & Co. was in a\r\nlittle street off Chancery Lane, and he had to ask his way two or three\r\ntimes. He felt that people were staring at him a great deal, and once\r\nhe took off his hat to see whether by chance the label had been left\r\non. When he arrived he knocked at the door; but no one answered, and\r\nlooking at his watch he found it was barely half past nine; he supposed\r\nhe was too early. He went away and ten minutes later returned to find\r\nan office-boy, with a long nose, pimply face, and a Scotch accent,\r\nopening the door. Philip asked for Mr. Herbert Carter. He had not come\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will he be here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween ten and half past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you wanting?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the office-boy.\r\n\r\nPhilip was nervous, but tried to hide the fact by a jocose manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work here if you have no objection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re the new articled clerk? You\xe2\x80\x99d better come in. Mr.\r\nGoodworthy\xe2\x80\x99ll be here in a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip walked in, and as he did so saw the office-boy\xe2\x80\x94he was about the\r\nsame age as Philip and called himself a junior clerk\xe2\x80\x94look at his foot.\r\nHe flushed and, sitting down, hid it behind the other. He looked round\r\nthe room. It was dark and very dingy. It was lit by a skylight. There\r\nwere three rows of desks in it and against them high stools. Over the\r\nchimney-piece was a dirty engraving of a prize-fight. Presently a clerk\r\ncame in and then another; they glanced at Philip and in an undertone\r\nasked the office-boy (Philip found his name was Macdougal) who he was.\r\nA whistle blew, and Macdougal got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Goodworthy\xe2\x80\x99s come. He\xe2\x80\x99s the managing clerk. Shall I tell him\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nThe office-boy went out and in a moment returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip followed him across the passage and was shown into a room, small\r\nand barely furnished, in which a little, thin man was standing with his\r\nback to the fireplace. He was much below the middle height, but his\r\nlarge head, which seemed to hang loosely on his body, gave him an odd\r\nungainliness. His features were wide and flattened, and he had\r\nprominent, pale eyes; his thin hair was sandy; he wore whiskers that\r\ngrew unevenly on his face, and in places where you would have expected\r\nthe hair to grow thickly there was no hair at all. His skin was pasty\r\nand yellow. He held out his hand to Philip, and when he smiled showed\r\nbadly decayed teeth. He spoke with a patronising and at the same time a\r\ntimid air, as though he sought to assume an importance which he did not\r\nfeel. He said he hoped Philip would like the work; there was a good\r\ndeal of drudgery about it, but when you got used to it, it was\r\ninteresting; and one made money, that was the chief thing, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nHe laughed with his odd mixture of superiority and shyness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Carter will be here presently,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a little late on\r\nMonday mornings sometimes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you when he comes. In the meantime\r\nI must give you something to do. Do you know anything about\r\nbook-keeping or accounts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you would. They don\xe2\x80\x99t teach you things at school that\r\nare much use in business, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d He considered for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink I can find you something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went into the next room and after a little while came out with a\r\nlarge cardboard box. It contained a vast number of letters in great\r\ndisorder, and he told Philip to sort them out and arrange them\r\nalphabetically according to the names of the writers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to the room in which the articled clerk generally sits.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice fellow in it. His name is Watson. He\xe2\x80\x99s a son of\r\nWatson, Crag, and Thompson\xe2\x80\x94you know\xe2\x80\x94the brewers. He\xe2\x80\x99s spending a year\r\nwith us to learn business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Goodworthy led Philip through the dingy office, where now six or\r\neight clerks were working, into a narrow room behind. It had been made\r\ninto a separate apartment by a glass partition, and here they found\r\nWatson sitting back in a chair, reading The Sportsman. He was a large,\r\nstout young man, elegantly dressed, and he looked up as Mr. Goodworthy\r\nentered. He asserted his position by calling the managing clerk\r\nGoodworthy. The managing clerk objected to the familiarity, and\r\npointedly called him Mr. Watson, but Watson, instead of seeing that it\r\nwas a rebuke, accepted the title as a tribute to his gentlemanliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see they\xe2\x80\x99ve scratched Rigoletto,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Philip, as soon as they\r\nwere left alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, who knew nothing about horse-racing.\r\n\r\nHe looked with awe upon Watson\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful clothes. His tail-coat\r\nfitted him perfectly, and there was a valuable pin artfully stuck in\r\nthe middle of an enormous tie. On the chimney-piece rested his tall\r\nhat; it was saucy and bell-shaped and shiny. Philip felt himself very\r\nshabby. Watson began to talk of hunting\xe2\x80\x94it was such an infernal bore\r\nhaving to waste one\xe2\x80\x99s time in an infernal office, he would only be able\r\nto hunt on Saturdays\xe2\x80\x94and shooting: he had ripping invitations all over\r\nthe country and of course he had to refuse them. It was infernal luck,\r\nbut he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to put up with it long; he was only in this\r\ninternal hole for a year, and then he was going into the business, and\r\nhe would hunt four days a week and get all the shooting there was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got five years of it, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, waving his arm\r\nround the tiny room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay I shall see something of you. Carter does our accounts, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was somewhat overpowered by the young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s condescension.\r\nAt Blackstable they had always looked upon brewing with civil contempt,\r\nthe Vicar made little jokes about the beerage, and it was a surprising\r\nexperience for Philip to discover that Watson was such an important and\r\nmagnificent fellow. He had been to Winchester and to Oxford, and his\r\nconversation impressed the fact upon one with frequency. When he\r\ndiscovered the details of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s education his manner became more\r\npatronising still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, if one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go to a public school those sort of schools\r\nare the next best thing, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip asked about the other men in the office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t bother about them much, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Watson. \xe2\x80\x9cCarter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot a bad sort. We have him to dine now and then. All the rest are\r\nawful bounders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently Watson applied himself to some work he had in hand, and\r\nPhilip set about sorting his letters. Then Mr. Goodworthy came in to\r\nsay that Mr. Carter had arrived. He took Philip into a large room next\r\ndoor to his own. There was a big desk in it, and a couple of big\r\narm-chairs; a Turkey carpet adorned the floor, and the walls were\r\ndecorated with sporting prints. Mr. Carter was sitting at the desk and\r\ngot up to shake hands with Philip. He was dressed in a long frock coat.\r\nHe looked like a military man; his moustache was waxed, his gray hair\r\nwas short and neat, he held himself upright, he talked in a breezy way,\r\nhe lived at Enfield. He was very keen on games and the good of the\r\ncountry. He was an officer in the Hertfordshire Yeomanry and chairman\r\nof the Conservative Association. When he was told that a local magnate\r\nhad said no one would take him for a City man, he felt that he had not\r\nlived in vain. He talked to Philip in a pleasant, off-hand fashion. Mr.\r\nGoodworthy would look after him. Watson was a nice fellow, perfect\r\ngentleman, good sportsman\xe2\x80\x94did Philip hunt? Pity, THE sport for\r\ngentlemen. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much chance of hunting now, had to leave that to\r\nhis son. His son was at Cambridge, he\xe2\x80\x99d sent him to Rugby, fine school\r\nRugby, nice class of boys there, in a couple of years his son would be\r\narticled, that would be nice for Philip, he\xe2\x80\x99d like his son, thorough\r\nsportsman. He hoped Philip would get on well and like the work, he\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t miss his lectures, they were getting up the tone of the\r\nprofession, they wanted gentlemen in it. Well, well, Mr. Goodworthy was\r\nthere. If he wanted to know anything Mr. Goodworthy would tell him.\r\nWhat was his handwriting like? Ah well, Mr. Goodworthy would see about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nPhilip was overwhelmed by so much gentlemanliness: in East Anglia they\r\nknew who were gentlemen and who weren\xe2\x80\x99t, but the gentlemen didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first the novelty of the work kept Philip interested. Mr. Carter\r\ndictated letters to him, and he had to make fair copies of statements\r\nof accounts.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter preferred to conduct the office on gentlemanly lines; he\r\nwould have nothing to do with typewriting and looked upon shorthand\r\nwith disfavour: the office-boy knew shorthand, but it was only Mr.\r\nGoodworthy who made use of his accomplishment. Now and then Philip with\r\none of the more experienced clerks went out to audit the accounts of\r\nsome firm: he came to know which of the clients must be treated with\r\nrespect and which were in low water. Now and then long lists of figures\r\nwere given him to add up. He attended lectures for his first\r\nexamination. Mr. Goodworthy repeated to him that the work was dull at\r\nfirst, but he would grow used to it. Philip left the office at six and\r\nwalked across the river to Waterloo. His supper was waiting for him\r\nwhen he reached his lodgings and he spent the evening reading. On\r\nSaturday afternoons he went to the National Gallery. Hayward had\r\nrecommended to him a guide which had been compiled out of Ruskin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworks, and with this in hand he went industriously through room after\r\nroom: he read carefully what the critic had said about a picture and\r\nthen in a determined fashion set himself to see the same things in it.\r\nHis Sundays were difficult to get through. He knew no one in London and\r\nspent them by himself. Mr. Nixon, the solicitor, asked him to spend a\r\nSunday at Hampstead, and Philip passed a happy day with a set of\r\nexuberant strangers; he ate and drank a great deal, took a walk on the\r\nheath, and came away with a general invitation to come again whenever\r\nhe liked; but he was morbidly afraid of being in the way, so waited for\r\na formal invitation. Naturally enough it never came, for with numbers\r\nof friends of their own the Nixons did not think of the lonely, silent\r\nboy whose claim upon their hospitality was so small. So on Sundays he\r\ngot up late and took a walk along the tow-path. At Barnes the river is\r\nmuddy, dingy, and tidal; it has neither the graceful charm of the\r\nThames above the locks nor the romance of the crowded stream below\r\nLondon Bridge. In the afternoon he walked about the common; and that is\r\ngray and dingy too; it is neither country nor town; the gorse is\r\nstunted; and all about is the litter of civilisation. He went to a play\r\nevery Saturday night and stood cheerfully for an hour or more at the\r\ngallery-door. It was not worth while to go back to Barnes for the\r\ninterval between the closing of the Museum and his meal in an A. B. C.\r\nshop, and the time hung heavily on his hands. He strolled up Bond\r\nStreet or through the Burlington Arcade, and when he was tired went and\r\nsat down in the Park or in wet weather in the public library in St.\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s Lane. He looked at the people walking about and envied them\r\nbecause they had friends; sometimes his envy turned to hatred because\r\nthey were happy and he was miserable. He had never imagined that it was\r\npossible to be so lonely in a great city. Sometimes when he was\r\nstanding at the gallery-door the man next to him would attempt a\r\nconversation; but Philip had the country boy\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion of strangers\r\nand answered in such a way as to prevent any further acquaintance.\r\nAfter the play was over, obliged to keep to himself all he thought\r\nabout it, he hurried across the bridge to Waterloo. When he got back to\r\nhis rooms, in which for economy no fire had been lit, his heart sank.\r\nIt was horribly cheerless. He began to loathe his lodgings and the long\r\nsolitary evenings he spent in them. Sometimes he felt so lonely that he\r\ncould not read, and then he sat looking into the fire hour after hour\r\nin bitter wretchedness.\r\n\r\nHe had spent three months in London now, and except for that one Sunday\r\nat Hampstead had never talked to anyone but his fellow-clerks. One\r\nevening Watson asked him to dinner at a restaurant and they went to a\r\nmusic-hall together; but he felt shy and uncomfortable. Watson talked\r\nall the time of things he did not care about, and while he looked upon\r\nWatson as a Philistine he could not help admiring him. He was angry\r\nbecause Watson obviously set no store on his culture, and with his way\r\nof taking himself at the estimate at which he saw others held him he\r\nbegan to despise the acquirements which till then had seemed to him not\r\nunimportant. He felt for the first time the humiliation of poverty. His\r\nuncle sent him fourteen pounds a month and he had had to buy a good\r\nmany clothes. His evening suit cost him five guineas. He had not dared\r\ntell Watson that it was bought in the Strand. Watson said there was\r\nonly one tailor in London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t dance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Watson, one day, with a glance at\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s club-foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked to bring some dancing men to a ball. I could\r\nhave introduced you to some jolly girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, hating the thought of going back to Barnes, Philip had\r\nremained in town, and late in the evening wandered through the West End\r\ntill he found some house at which there was a party. He stood among the\r\nlittle group of shabby people, behind the footmen, watching the guests\r\narrive, and he listened to the music that floated through the window.\r\nSometimes, notwithstanding the cold, a couple came on to the balcony\r\nand stood for a moment to get some fresh air; and Philip, imagining\r\nthat they were in love with one another, turned away and limped along\r\nthe street with a heavy hurt. He would never be able to stand in that\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s place. He felt that no woman could ever really look upon him\r\nwithout distaste for his deformity.\r\n\r\nThat reminded him of Miss Wilkinson. He thought of her without\r\nsatisfaction. Before parting they had made an arrangement that she\r\nshould write to Charing Cross Post Office till he was able to send her\r\nan address, and when he went there he found three letters from her. She\r\nwrote on blue paper with violet ink, and she wrote in French. Philip\r\nwondered why she could not write in English like a sensible woman, and\r\nher passionate expressions, because they reminded him of a French\r\nnovel, left him cold. She upbraided him for not having written, and\r\nwhen he answered he excused himself by saying that he had been busy. He\r\ndid not quite know how to start the letter. He could not bring himself\r\nto use dearest or darling, and he hated to address her as Emily, so\r\nfinally he began with the word dear. It looked odd, standing by itself,\r\nand rather silly, but he made it do. It was the first love letter he\r\nhad ever written, and he was conscious of its tameness; he felt that he\r\nshould say all sorts of vehement things, how he thought of her every\r\nminute of the day and how he longed to kiss her beautiful hands and how\r\nhe trembled at the thought of her red lips, but some inexplicable\r\nmodesty prevented him; and instead he told her of his new rooms and his\r\noffice. The answer came by return of post, angry, heart-broken,\r\nreproachful: how could he be so cold? Did he not know that she hung on\r\nhis letters? She had given him all that a woman could give, and this\r\nwas her reward. Was he tired of her already? Then, because he did not\r\nreply for several days, Miss Wilkinson bombarded him with letters. She\r\ncould not bear his unkindness, she waited for the post, and it never\r\nbrought her his letter, she cried herself to sleep night after night,\r\nshe was looking so ill that everyone remarked on it: if he did not love\r\nher why did he not say so? She added that she could not live without\r\nhim, and the only thing was for her to commit suicide. She told him he\r\nwas cold and selfish and ungrateful. It was all in French, and Philip\r\nknew that she wrote in that language to show off, but he was worried\r\nall the same. He did not want to make her unhappy. In a little while\r\nshe wrote that she could not bear the separation any longer, she would\r\narrange to come over to London for Christmas. Philip wrote back that he\r\nwould like nothing better, only he had already an engagement to spend\r\nChristmas with friends in the country, and he did not see how he could\r\nbreak it. She answered that she did not wish to force herself on him,\r\nit was quite evident that he did not wish to see her; she was deeply\r\nhurt, and she never thought he would repay with such cruelty all her\r\nkindness. Her letter was touching, and Philip thought he saw marks of\r\nher tears on the paper; he wrote an impulsive reply saying that he was\r\ndreadfully sorry and imploring her to come; but it was with relief that\r\nhe received her answer in which she said that she found it would be\r\nimpossible for her to get away. Presently when her letters came his\r\nheart sank: he delayed opening them, for he knew what they would\r\ncontain, angry reproaches and pathetic appeals; they would make him\r\nfeel a perfect beast, and yet he did not see with what he had to blame\r\nhimself. He put off his answer from day to day, and then another letter\r\nwould come, saying she was ill and lonely and miserable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to God I\xe2\x80\x99d never had anything to do with her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe admired Watson because he arranged these things so easily. The young\r\nman had been engaged in an intrigue with a girl who played in touring\r\ncompanies, and his account of the affair filled Philip with envious\r\namazement. But after a time Watson\xe2\x80\x99s young affections changed, and one\r\nday he described the rupture to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was no good making any bones about it so I just told her\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t she make an awful scene?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe usual thing, you know, but I told her it was no good trying on\r\nthat sort of thing with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she cry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe began to, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand women when they cry, so I said she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter hook it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s sense of humour was growing keener with advancing years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did she hook it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything else for her to do, was there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Christmas holidays approached. Mrs. Carey had been ill\r\nall through November, and the doctor suggested that she and the Vicar\r\nshould go to Cornwall for a couple of weeks round Christmas so that she\r\nshould get back her strength. The result was that Philip had nowhere to\r\ngo, and he spent Christmas Day in his lodgings. Under Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence he had persuaded himself that the festivities that attend\r\nthis season were vulgar and barbaric, and he made up his mind that he\r\nwould take no notice of the day; but when it came, the jollity of all\r\naround affected him strangely. His landlady and her husband were\r\nspending the day with a married daughter, and to save trouble Philip\r\nannounced that he would take his meals out. He went up to London\r\ntowards mid-day and ate a slice of turkey and some Christmas pudding by\r\nhimself at Gatti\xe2\x80\x99s, and since he had nothing to do afterwards went to\r\nWestminster Abbey for the afternoon service. The streets were almost\r\nempty, and the people who went along had a preoccupied look; they did\r\nnot saunter but walked with some definite goal in view, and hardly\r\nanyone was alone. To Philip they all seemed happy. He felt himself more\r\nsolitary than he had ever done in his life. His intention had been to\r\nkill the day somehow in the streets and then dine at a restaurant, but\r\nhe could not face again the sight of cheerful people, talking,\r\nlaughing, and making merry; so he went back to Waterloo, and on his way\r\nthrough the Westminster Bridge Road bought some ham and a couple of\r\nmince pies and went back to Barnes. He ate his food in his lonely\r\nlittle room and spent the evening with a book. His depression was\r\nalmost intolerable.\r\n\r\nWhen he was back at the office it made him very sore to listen to\r\nWatson\xe2\x80\x99s account of the short holiday. They had had some jolly girls\r\nstaying with them, and after dinner they had cleared out the\r\ndrawing-room and had a dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to bed till three and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I got there then.\r\nBy George, I was squiffy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last Philip asked desperately:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does one get to know people in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWatson looked at him with surprise and with a slightly contemptuous\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, one just knows them. If you go to dances you soon\r\nget to know as many people as you can do with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip hated Watson, and yet he would have given anything to change\r\nplaces with him. The old feeling that he had had at school came back to\r\nhim, and he tried to throw himself into the other\xe2\x80\x99s skin, imagining\r\nwhat life would be if he were Watson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year there was a great deal to do. Philip went to\r\nvarious places with a clerk named Thompson and spent the day\r\nmonotonously calling out items of expenditure, which the other checked;\r\nand sometimes he was given long pages of figures to add up. He had\r\nnever had a head for figures, and he could only do this slowly.\r\nThompson grew irritated at his mistakes. His fellow-clerk was a long,\r\nlean man of forty, sallow, with black hair and a ragged moustache; he\r\nhad hollow cheeks and deep lines on each side of his nose. He took a\r\ndislike to Philip because he was an articled clerk. Because he could\r\nput down three hundred guineas and keep himself for five years Philip\r\nhad the chance of a career; while he, with his experience and ability,\r\nhad no possibility of ever being more than a clerk at thirty-five\r\nshillings a week. He was a cross-grained man, oppressed by a large\r\nfamily, and he resented the superciliousness which he fancied he saw in\r\nPhilip. He sneered at Philip because he was better educated than\r\nhimself, and he mocked at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s pronunciation; he could not forgive\r\nhim because he spoke without a cockney accent, and when he talked to\r\nhim sarcastically exaggerated his aitches. At first his manner was\r\nmerely gruff and repellent, but as he discovered that Philip had no\r\ngift for accountancy he took pleasure in humiliating him; his attacks\r\nwere gross and silly, but they wounded Philip, and in self-defence he\r\nassumed an attitude of superiority which he did not feel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad a bath this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d Thompson said when Philip came to the office\r\nlate, for his early punctuality had not lasted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a gentleman, I\xe2\x80\x99m only a clerk. I have a bath on Saturday\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re more than usually disagreeable on Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you condescend to do a few sums in simple addition today? I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid it\xe2\x80\x99s asking a great deal from a gentleman who knows Latin and\r\nGreek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour attempts at sarcasm are not very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Philip could not conceal from himself that the other clerks,\r\nill-paid and uncouth, were more useful than himself. Once or twice Mr.\r\nGoodworthy grew impatient with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really ought to be able to do better than this by now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not even as smart as the office-boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip listened sulkily. He did not like being blamed, and it\r\nhumiliated him, when, having been given accounts to make fair copies\r\nof, Mr. Goodworthy was not satisfied and gave them to another clerk to\r\ndo. At first the work had been tolerable from its novelty, but now it\r\ngrew irksome; and when he discovered that he had no aptitude for it, he\r\nbegan to hate it. Often, when he should have been doing something that\r\nwas given him, he wasted his time drawing little pictures on the office\r\nnote-paper. He made sketches of Watson in every conceivable attitude,\r\nand Watson was impressed by his talent. It occurred to him to take the\r\ndrawings home, and he came back next day with the praises of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you didn\xe2\x80\x99t become a painter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly of course\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no money in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt chanced that Mr. Carter two or three days later was dining with the\r\nWatsons, and the sketches were shown him. The following morning he sent\r\nfor Philip. Philip saw him seldom and stood in some awe of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, young fellow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you do out of office-hours,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those sketches of yours and they\xe2\x80\x99re on office-paper, and\r\nMr. Goodworthy tells me you\xe2\x80\x99re slack. You won\xe2\x80\x99t do any good as a\r\nchartered accountant unless you look alive. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fine profession, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re getting a very good class of men in it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a profession in\r\nwhich you have to\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d he looked for the termination of his phrase, but\r\ncould not find exactly what he wanted, so finished rather tamely, \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nwhich you have to look alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps Philip would have settled down but for the agreement that if he\r\ndid not like the work he could leave after a year, and get back half\r\nthe money paid for his articles. He felt that he was fit for something\r\nbetter than to add up accounts, and it was humiliating that he did so\r\nill something which seemed contemptible. The vulgar scenes with\r\nThompson got on his nerves. In March Watson ended his year at the\r\noffice and Philip, though he did not care for him, saw him go with\r\nregret. The fact that the other clerks disliked them equally, because\r\nthey belonged to a class a little higher than their own, was a bond of\r\nunion. When Philip thought that he must spend over four years more with\r\nthat dreary set of fellows his heart sank. He had expected wonderful\r\nthings from London and it had given him nothing. He hated it now. He\r\ndid not know a soul, and he had no idea how he was to get to know\r\nanyone. He was tired of going everywhere by himself. He began to feel\r\nthat he could not stand much more of such a life. He would lie in bed\r\nat night and think of the joy of never seeing again that dingy office\r\nor any of the men in it, and of getting away from those drab lodgings.\r\n\r\nA great disappointment befell him in the spring. Hayward had announced\r\nhis intention of coming to London for the season, and Philip had looked\r\nforward very much to seeing him again. He had read so much lately and\r\nthought so much that his mind was full of ideas which he wanted to\r\ndiscuss, and he knew nobody who was willing to interest himself in\r\nabstract things. He was quite excited at the thought of talking his\r\nfill with someone, and he was wretched when Hayward wrote to say that\r\nthe spring was lovelier than ever he had known it in Italy, and he\r\ncould not bear to tear himself away. He went on to ask why Philip did\r\nnot come. What was the use of squandering the days of his youth in an\r\noffice when the world was beautiful? The letter proceeded.\r\n\r\n I wonder you can bear it. I think of Fleet Street and Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn\r\n now with a shudder of disgust. There are only two things in the world\r\n that make life worth living, love and art. I cannot imagine you\r\n sitting in an office over a ledger, and do you wear a tall hat and an\r\n umbrella and a little black bag? My feeling is that one should look\r\n upon life as an adventure, one should burn with the hard, gem-like\r\n flame, and one should take risks, one should expose oneself to danger.\r\n Why do you not go to Paris and study art? I always thought you had\r\n talent.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion fell in with the possibility that Philip for some time\r\nhad been vaguely turning over in his mind. It startled him at first,\r\nbut he could not help thinking of it, and in the constant rumination\r\nover it he found his only escape from the wretchedness of his present\r\nstate. They all thought he had talent; at Heidelberg they had admired\r\nhis water colours, Miss Wilkinson had told him over and over again that\r\nthey were chasing; even strangers like the Watsons had been struck by\r\nhis sketches. La Vie de Boheme had made a deep impression on him. He\r\nhad brought it to London and when he was most depressed he had only to\r\nread a few pages to be transported into those chasing attics where\r\nRodolphe and the rest of them danced and loved and sang. He began to\r\nthink of Paris as before he had thought of London, but he had no fear\r\nof a second disillusion; he yearned for romance and beauty and love,\r\nand Paris seemed to offer them all. He had a passion for pictures, and\r\nwhy should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else? He wrote to\r\nMiss Wilkinson and asked her how much she thought he could live on in\r\nParis. She told him that he could manage easily on eighty pounds a\r\nyear, and she enthusiastically approved of his project. She told him he\r\nwas too good to be wasted in an office. Who would be a clerk when he\r\nmight be a great artist, she asked dramatically, and she besought\r\nPhilip to believe in himself: that was the great thing. But Philip had\r\na cautious nature. It was all very well for Hayward to talk of taking\r\nrisks, he had three hundred a year in gilt-edged securities; Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentire fortune amounted to no more than eighteen-hundred pounds. He\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\nThen it chanced that one day Mr. Goodworthy asked him suddenly if he\r\nwould like to go to Paris. The firm did the accounts for a hotel in the\r\nFaubourg St. Honore, which was owned by an English company, and twice a\r\nyear Mr. Goodworthy and a clerk went over. The clerk who generally went\r\nhappened to be ill, and a press of work prevented any of the others\r\nfrom getting away. Mr. Goodworthy thought of Philip because he could\r\nbest be spared, and his articles gave him some claim upon a job which\r\nwas one of the pleasures of the business. Philip was delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99ave to work all day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Goodworthy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we get our\r\nevenings to ourselves, and Paris is Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled in a knowing way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do us very well at the hotel, and they give us all our meals, so\r\nit don\xe2\x80\x99t cost one anything. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way I like going to Paris, at\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Calais and Philip saw the crowd of gesticulating\r\nporters his heart leaped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the real thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\nHe was all eyes as the train sped through the country; he adored the\r\nsand dunes, their colour seemed to him more lovely than anything he had\r\never seen; and he was enchanted with the canals and the long lines of\r\npoplars. When they got out of the Gare du Nord, and trundled along the\r\ncobbled streets in a ramshackle, noisy cab, it seemed to him that he\r\nwas breathing a new air so intoxicating that he could hardly restrain\r\nhimself from shouting aloud. They were met at the door of the hotel by\r\nthe manager, a stout, pleasant man, who spoke tolerable English; Mr.\r\nGoodworthy was an old friend and he greeted them effusively; they dined\r\nin his private room with his wife, and to Philip it seemed that he had\r\nnever eaten anything so delicious as the beefsteak aux pommes, nor\r\ndrunk such nectar as the vin ordinaire, which were set before them.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Goodworthy, a respectable householder with excellent principles,\r\nthe capital of France was a paradise of the joyously obscene. He asked\r\nthe manager next morning what there was to be seen that was \xe2\x80\x98thick.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nthoroughly enjoyed these visits of his to Paris; he said they kept you\r\nfrom growing rusty. In the evenings, after their work was over and they\r\nhad dined, he took Philip to the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergeres.\r\nHis little eyes twinkled and his face wore a sly, sensual smile as he\r\nsought out the pornographic. He went into all the haunts which were\r\nspecially arranged for the foreigner, and afterwards said that a nation\r\ncould come to no good which permitted that sort of thing. He nudged\r\nPhilip when at some revue a woman appeared with practically nothing on,\r\nand pointed out to him the most strapping of the courtesans who walked\r\nabout the hall. It was a vulgar Paris that he showed Philip, but Philip\r\nsaw it with eyes blinded with illusion. In the early morning he would\r\nrush out of the hotel and go to the Champs Elysees, and stand at the\r\nPlace de la Concorde. It was June, and Paris was silvery with the\r\ndelicacy of the air. Philip felt his heart go out to the people. Here\r\nhe thought at last was romance.\r\n\r\nThey spent the inside of a week there, leaving on Sunday, and when\r\nPhilip late at night reached his dingy rooms in Barnes his mind was\r\nmade up; he would surrender his articles, and go to Paris to study art;\r\nbut so that no one should think him unreasonable he determined to stay\r\nat the office till his year was up. He was to have his holiday during\r\nthe last fortnight in August, and when he went away he would tell\r\nHerbert Carter that he had no intention of returning. But though Philip\r\ncould force himself to go to the office every day he could not even\r\npretend to show any interest in the work. His mind was occupied with\r\nthe future. After the middle of July there was nothing much to do and\r\nhe escaped a good deal by pretending he had to go to lectures for his\r\nfirst examination. The time he got in this way he spent in the National\r\nGallery. He read books about Paris and books about painting. He was\r\nsteeped in Ruskin. He read many of Vasari\xe2\x80\x99s lives of the painters. He\r\nliked that story of Correggio, and he fancied himself standing before\r\nsome great masterpiece and crying: Anch\xe2\x80\x99 io son\xe2\x80\x99 pittore. His\r\nhesitation had left him now, and he was convinced that he had in him\r\nthe makings of a great painter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, I can only try,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing in\r\nlife is to take risks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last came the middle of August. Mr. Carter was spending the month in\r\nScotland, and the managing clerk was in charge of the office. Mr.\r\nGoodworthy had seemed pleasantly disposed to Philip since their trip to\r\nParis, and now that Philip knew he was so soon to be free, he could\r\nlook upon the funny little man with tolerance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going for your holiday tomorrow, Carey?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to him in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAll day Philip had been telling himself that this was the last time he\r\nwould ever sit in that hateful office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this is the end of my year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ve not done very well. Mr. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s very dissatisfied\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot nearly so dissatisfied as I am with Mr. Carter,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Philip\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you should speak like that, Carey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not coming back. I made the arrangement that if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\naccountancy Mr. Carter would return me half the money I paid for my\r\narticles and I could chuck it at the end of a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to such a decision hastily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor ten months I\xe2\x80\x99ve loathed it all, I\xe2\x80\x99ve loathed the work, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nloathed the office, I loathe London. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather sweep a crossing than\r\nspend my days here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re very fitted for accountancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, holding out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to thank you for\r\nyour kindness to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if I\xe2\x80\x99ve been troublesome. I knew almost\r\nfrom the beginning I was no good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you really do make up your mind it is good-bye. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re in the neighbourhood at any time\r\ncome in and see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip gave a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it sounds very rude, but I hope from the bottom of my heart\r\nthat I shall never set eyes on any of you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vicar of Blackstable would have nothing to do with the scheme which\r\nPhilip laid before him. He had a great idea that one should stick to\r\nwhatever one had begun. Like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress\r\non not changing one\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou chose to be an accountant of your own free will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just took that because it was the only chance I saw of getting up to\r\ntown. I hate London, I hate the work, and nothing will induce me to go\r\nback to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Carey were frankly shocked at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s idea of being an\r\nartist. He should not forget, they said, that his father and mother\r\nwere gentlefolk, and painting wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a serious profession; it was\r\nBohemian, disreputable, immoral. And then Paris!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as I have anything to say in the matter, I shall not allow you\r\nto live in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar firmly.\r\n\r\nIt was a sink of iniquity. The scarlet woman and she of Babylon\r\nflaunted their vileness there; the cities of the plain were not more\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been brought up like a gentleman and Christian, and I should be\r\nfalse to the trust laid upon me by your dead father and mother if I\r\nallowed you to expose yourself to such temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not a Christian and I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to doubt whether\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nThe dispute grew more violent. There was another year before Philip\r\ntook possession of his small inheritance, and during that time Mr.\r\nCarey proposed only to give him an allowance if he remained at the\r\noffice. It was clear to Philip that if he meant not to continue with\r\naccountancy he must leave it while he could still get back half the\r\nmoney that had been paid for his articles. The Vicar would not listen.\r\nPhilip, losing all reserve, said things to wound and irritate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got no right to waste my money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s my money, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child. You can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent me from\r\ngoing to Paris if I make up my mind to. You can\xe2\x80\x99t force me to go back\r\nto London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can do is to refuse you money unless you do what I think fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind to go to Paris. I shall sell\r\nmy clothes, and my books, and my father\xe2\x80\x99s jewellery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Louisa sat by in silence, anxious and unhappy. She saw that Philip\r\nwas beside himself, and anything she said then would but increase his\r\nanger. Finally the Vicar announced that he wished to hear nothing more\r\nabout it and with dignity left the room. For the next three days\r\nneither Philip nor he spoke to one another. Philip wrote to Hayward for\r\ninformation about Paris, and made up his mind to set out as soon as he\r\ngot a reply. Mrs. Carey turned the matter over in her mind incessantly;\r\nshe felt that Philip included her in the hatred he bore her husband,\r\nand the thought tortured her. She loved him with all her heart. At\r\nlength she spoke to him; she listened attentively while he poured out\r\nall his disillusionment of London and his eager ambition for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may be no good, but at least let me have a try. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be a worse\r\nfailure than I was in that beastly office. And I feel that I can paint.\r\nI know I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was not so sure as her husband that they did right in thwarting so\r\nstrong an inclination. She had read of great painters whose parents had\r\nopposed their wish to study, the event had shown with what folly; and\r\nafter all it was just as possible for a painter to lead a virtuous life\r\nto the glory of God as for a chartered accountant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so afraid of your going to Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d she said piteously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so bad if you studied in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m going in for painting I must do it thoroughly, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only in\r\nParis that you can get the real thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt his suggestion Mrs. Carey wrote to the solicitor, saying that Philip\r\nwas discontented with his work in London, and asking what he thought of\r\na change. Mr. Nixon answered as follows:\r\n\r\nDear Mrs. Carey,\r\n\r\nI have seen Mr. Herbert Carter, and I am afraid I must tell you that\r\nPhilip has not done so well as one could have wished. If he is very\r\nstrongly set against the work, perhaps it is better that he should take\r\nthe opportunity there is now to break his articles. I am naturally very\r\ndisappointed, but as you know you can take a horse to the water, but\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t make him drink.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely,\r\n  Albert Nixon.\r\n\r\nThe letter was shown to the Vicar, but served only to increase his\r\nobstinacy. He was willing enough that Philip should take up some other\r\nprofession, he suggested his father\xe2\x80\x99s calling, medicine, but nothing\r\nwould induce him to pay an allowance if Philip went to Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a mere excuse for self-indulgence and sensuality,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m interested to hear you blame self-indulgence in others,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted\r\nPhilip acidly.\r\n\r\nBut by this time an answer had come from Hayward, giving the name of a\r\nhotel where Philip could get a room for thirty francs a month and\r\nenclosing a note of introduction to the massiere of a school. Philip\r\nread the letter to Mrs. Carey and told her he proposed to start on the\r\nfirst of September.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any money?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going into Tercanbury this afternoon to sell the jewellery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had inherited from his father a gold watch and chain, two or three\r\nrings, some links, and two pins. One of them was a pearl and might\r\nfetch a considerable sum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very different thing, what a thing\xe2\x80\x99s worth and what it\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfetch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Louisa.\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled, for this was one of his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s stock phrases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but at the worst I think I can get a hundred pounds on the\r\nlot, and that\xe2\x80\x99ll keep me till I\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey did not answer, but she went upstairs, put on her little\r\nblack bonnet, and went to the bank. In an hour she came back. She went\r\nto Philip, who was reading in the drawing-room, and handed him an\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little present for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, smiling shyly.\r\n\r\nHe opened it and found eleven five-pound notes and a little paper sack\r\nbulging with sovereigns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to let you sell your father\xe2\x80\x99s jewellery. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmoney I had in the bank. It comes to very nearly a hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip blushed, and, he knew not why, tears suddenly filled his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s most awfully good of\r\nyou, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Carey was married she had three hundred pounds, and this\r\nmoney, carefully watched, had been used by her to meet any unforeseen\r\nexpense, any urgent charity, or to buy Christmas and birthday presents\r\nfor her husband and for Philip. In the course of years it had\r\ndiminished sadly, but it was still with the Vicar a subject for\r\njesting. He talked of his wife as a rich woman and he constantly spoke\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x98nest egg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please take it, Philip. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry I\xe2\x80\x99ve been extravagant, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s only that left. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll make me so happy if you\xe2\x80\x99ll accept\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll want it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall. I was keeping it in case your uncle died\r\nbefore me. I thought it would be useful to have a little something I\r\ncould get at immediately if I wanted it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall live\r\nvery much longer now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. Why, of course you\xe2\x80\x99re going to live for\r\never. I can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly spare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice broke and she hid her eyes, but in a\r\nmoment, drying them, she smiled bravely. \xe2\x80\x9cAt first, I used to pray to\r\nGod that He might not take me first, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want your uncle\r\nto be left alone, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to have all the suffering, but now\r\nI know that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mean so much to your uncle as it would mean to\r\nme. He wants to live more than I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been the wife he\r\nwanted, and I daresay he\xe2\x80\x99d marry again if anything happened to me. So I\r\nshould like to go first. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s selfish of me, Philip, do\r\nyou? But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it if he went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip kissed her wrinkled, thin cheek. He did not know why the sight\r\nhe had of that overwhelming love made him feel strangely ashamed. It\r\nwas incomprehensible that she should care so much for a man who was so\r\nindifferent, so selfish, so grossly self-indulgent; and he divined\r\ndimly that in her heart she knew his indifference and his selfishness,\r\nknew them and loved him humbly all the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will take the money, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently stroking his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you can do without it, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll give me so much happiness.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to do something for you. You see, I never had a\r\nchild of my own, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved you as if you were my son. When you\r\nwere a little boy, though I knew it was wicked, I used to wish almost\r\nthat you might be ill, so that I could nurse you day and night. But you\r\nwere only ill once and then it was at school. I should so like to help\r\nyou. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only chance I shall ever have. And perhaps some day when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a great artist you won\xe2\x80\x99t forget me, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that I\r\ngave you your start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very good of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d A smile came\r\ninto her tired eyes, a smile of pure happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later Mrs. Carey went to the station to see Philip off. She\r\nstood at the door of the carriage, trying to keep back her tears.\r\nPhilip was restless and eager. He wanted to be gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss me once more,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe leaned out of the window and kissed her. The train started, and she\r\nstood on the wooden platform of the little station, waving her\r\nhandkerchief till it was out of sight. Her heart was dreadfully heavy,\r\nand the few hundred yards to the vicarage seemed very, very long. It\r\nwas natural enough that he should be eager to go, she thought, he was a\r\nboy and the future beckoned to him; but she\xe2\x80\x94she clenched her teeth so\r\nthat she should not cry. She uttered a little inward prayer that God\r\nwould guard him, and keep him out of temptation, and give him happiness\r\nand good fortune.\r\n\r\nBut Philip ceased to think of her a moment after he had settled down in\r\nhis carriage. He thought only of the future. He had written to Mrs.\r\nOtter, the massiere to whom Hayward had given him an introduction, and\r\nhad in his pocket an invitation to tea on the following day. When he\r\narrived in Paris he had his luggage put on a cab and trundled off\r\nslowly through the gay streets, over the bridge, and along the narrow\r\nways of the Latin Quarter. He had taken a room at the Hotel des Deux\r\nEcoles, which was in a shabby street off the Boulevard du Montparnasse;\r\nit was convenient for Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s School at which he was going to work.\r\nA waiter took his box up five flights of stairs, and Philip was shown\r\ninto a tiny room, fusty from unopened windows, the greater part of\r\nwhich was taken up by a large wooden bed with a canopy over it of red\r\nrep; there were heavy curtains on the windows of the same dingy\r\nmaterial; the chest of drawers served also as a washing-stand; and\r\nthere was a massive wardrobe of the style which is connected with the\r\ngood King Louis Philippe. The wall-paper was discoloured with age; it\r\nwas dark gray, and there could be vaguely seen on it garlands of brown\r\nleaves. To Philip the room seemed quaint and charming.\r\n\r\nThough it was late he felt too excited to sleep and, going out, made\r\nhis way into the boulevard and walked towards the light. This led him\r\nto the station; and the square in front of it, vivid with arc-lamps,\r\nnoisy with the yellow trams that seemed to cross it in all directions,\r\nmade him laugh aloud with joy. There were cafes all round, and by\r\nchance, thirsty and eager to get a nearer sight of the crowd, Philip\r\ninstalled himself at a little table outside the Cafe de Versailles.\r\nEvery other table was taken, for it was a fine night; and Philip looked\r\ncuriously at the people, here little family groups, there a knot of men\r\nwith odd-shaped hats and beards talking loudly and gesticulating; next\r\nto him were two men who looked like painters with women who Philip\r\nhoped were not their lawful wives; behind him he heard Americans loudly\r\narguing on art. His soul was thrilled. He sat till very late, tired out\r\nbut too happy to move, and when at last he went to bed he was wide\r\nawake; he listened to the manifold noise of Paris.\r\n\r\nNext day about tea-time he made his way to the Lion de Belfort, and in\r\na new street that led out of the Boulevard Raspail found Mrs. Otter.\r\nShe was an insignificant woman of thirty, with a provincial air and a\r\ndeliberately lady-like manner; she introduced him to her mother. He\r\ndiscovered presently that she had been studying in Paris for three\r\nyears and later that she was separated from her husband. She had in her\r\nsmall drawing-room one or two portraits which she had painted, and to\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s inexperience they seemed extremely accomplished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I shall ever be able to paint as well as that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I expect so,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, not without self-satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t expect to do everything all at once, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was very kind. She gave him the address of a shop where he could\r\nget a portfolio, drawing-paper, and charcoal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be going to Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s about nine tomorrow, and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nthere then I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you get a good place and all that sort of\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked him what he wanted to do, and Philip felt that he should not\r\nlet her see how vague he was about the whole matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, first I want to learn to draw,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad to hear you say that. People always want to do things in\r\nsuch a hurry. I never touched oils till I\xe2\x80\x99d been here for two years,\r\nand look at the result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a glance at the portrait of her mother, a sticky piece of\r\npainting that hung over the piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I were you, I would be very careful about the people you get to\r\nknow. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mix myself up with any foreigners. I\xe2\x80\x99m very careful\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thanked her for the suggestion, but it seemed to him odd. He did\r\nnot know that he particularly wanted to be careful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe live just as we would if we were in England,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Otter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother, who till then had spoken little. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we came here we brought\r\nall our own furniture over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked round the room. It was filled with a massive suite, and\r\nat the window were the same sort of white lace curtains which Aunt\r\nLouisa put up at the vicarage in summer. The piano was draped in\r\nLiberty silk and so was the chimney-piece. Mrs. Otter followed his\r\nwandering eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the evening when we close the shutters one might really feel one\r\nwas in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we have our meals just as if we were at home,\xe2\x80\x9d added her mother.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA meat breakfast in the morning and dinner in the middle of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he left Mrs. Otter Philip went to buy drawing materials; and next\r\nmorning at the stroke of nine, trying to seem self-assured, he\r\npresented himself at the school. Mrs. Otter was already there, and she\r\ncame forward with a friendly smile. He had been anxious about the\r\nreception he would have as a nouveau, for he had read a good deal of\r\nthe rough joking to which a newcomer was exposed at some of the\r\nstudios; but Mrs. Otter had reassured him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like that here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, about half\r\nour students are ladies, and they set a tone to the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe studio was large and bare, with gray walls, on which were pinned\r\nthe studies that had received prizes. A model was sitting in a chair\r\nwith a loose wrap thrown over her, and about a dozen men and women were\r\nstanding about, some talking and others still working on their sketch.\r\nIt was the first rest of the model.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better not try anything too difficult at first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nOtter. \xe2\x80\x9cPut your easel here. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find that\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest pose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip placed an easel where she indicated, and Mrs. Otter introduced\r\nhim to a young woman who sat next to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Carey\xe2\x80\x94Miss Price. Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s never studied before, you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nhelping him a little just at first will you?\xe2\x80\x9d Then she turned to the\r\nmodel. \xe2\x80\x9cLa Pose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe model threw aside the paper she had been reading, La Petite\r\nRepublique, and sulkily, throwing off her gown, got on to the stand.\r\nShe stood, squarely on both feet with her hands clasped behind her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a stupid pose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Price. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine why they chose\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Philip entered, the people in the studio had looked at him\r\ncuriously, and the model gave him an indifferent glance, but now they\r\nceased to pay attention to him. Philip, with his beautiful sheet of\r\npaper in front of him, stared awkwardly at the model. He did not know\r\nhow to begin. He had never seen a naked woman before. She was not young\r\nand her breasts were shrivelled. She had colourless, fair hair that\r\nfell over her forehead untidily, and her face was covered with large\r\nfreckles. He glanced at Miss Price\xe2\x80\x99s work. She had only been working on\r\nit two days, and it looked as though she had had trouble; her paper was\r\nin a mess from constant rubbing out, and to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes the figure\r\nlooked strangely distorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought I could do as well as that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\nHe began on the head, thinking that he would work slowly downwards,\r\nbut, he could not understand why, he found it infinitely more difficult\r\nto draw a head from the model than to draw one from his imagination. He\r\ngot into difficulties. He glanced at Miss Price. She was working with\r\nvehement gravity. Her brow was wrinkled with eagerness, and there was\r\nan anxious look in her eyes. It was hot in the studio, and drops of\r\nsweat stood on her forehead. She was a girl of twenty-six, with a great\r\ndeal of dull gold hair; it was handsome hair, but it was carelessly\r\ndone, dragged back from her forehead and tied in a hurried knot. She\r\nhad a large face, with broad, flat features and small eyes; her skin\r\nwas pasty, with a singular unhealthiness of tone, and there was no\r\ncolour in the cheeks. She had an unwashed air and you could not help\r\nwondering if she slept in her clothes. She was serious and silent. When\r\nthe next pause came, she stepped back to look at her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I\xe2\x80\x99m having so much bother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I mean to\r\nget it right.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a rueful smile.\r\n\r\nShe looked at what he had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to do anything that way. You must take measurements.\r\nAnd you must square out your paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed him rapidly how to set about the business. Philip was\r\nimpressed by her earnestness, but repelled by her want of charm. He was\r\ngrateful for the hints she gave him and set to work again. Meanwhile\r\nother people had come in, mostly men, for the women always arrived\r\nfirst, and the studio for the time of year (it was early yet) was\r\nfairly full. Presently there came in a young man with thin, black hair,\r\nan enormous nose, and a face so long that it reminded you of a horse.\r\nHe sat down next to Philip and nodded across him to Miss Price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very late,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you only just up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was such a splendid day, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d lie in bed and think how\r\nbeautiful it was out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled, but Miss Price took the remark seriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seems a funny thing to do, I should have thought it would be more\r\nto the point to get up and enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way of the humorist is very hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man gravely.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem inclined to work. He looked at his canvas; he was\r\nworking in colour, and had sketched in the day before the model who was\r\nposing. He turned to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you just come out from England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you find your way to Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the only school I knew of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you haven\xe2\x80\x99t come with the idea that you will learn anything\r\nhere which will be of the smallest use to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best school in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Price. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the only one\r\nwhere they take art seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould art be taken seriously?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man asked; and since Miss\r\nPrice replied only with a scornful shrug, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut the point is,\r\nall schools are bad. They are academical, obviously. Why this is less\r\ninjurious than most is that the teaching is more incompetent than\r\nelsewhere. Because you learn nothing\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why d\xe2\x80\x99you come here then?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see the better course, but do not follow it. Miss Price, who is\r\ncultured, will remember the Latin of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would leave me out of your conversation, Mr. Clutton,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Price brusquely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way to learn to paint,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, imperturbable, \xe2\x80\x9cis to\r\ntake a studio, hire a model, and just fight it out for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seems a simple thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt only needs money,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Clutton.\r\n\r\nHe began to paint, and Philip looked at him from the corner of his eye.\r\nHe was long and desperately thin; his huge bones seemed to protrude\r\nfrom his body; his elbows were so sharp that they appeared to jut out\r\nthrough the arms of his shabby coat. His trousers were frayed at the\r\nbottom, and on each of his boots was a clumsy patch. Miss Price got up\r\nand went over to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s easel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Clutton will hold his tongue for a moment, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just help you a\r\nlittle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Price dislikes me because I have humour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clutton, looking\r\nmeditatively at his canvas, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she detests me because I have genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with solemnity, and his colossal, misshapen nose made what he\r\nsaid very quaint. Philip was obliged to laugh, but Miss Price grew\r\ndarkly red with anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the only person who has ever accused you of genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso I am the only person whose opinion is of the least value to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Price began to criticise what Philip had done. She talked glibly\r\nof anatomy and construction, planes and lines, and of much else which\r\nPhilip did not understand. She had been at the studio a long time and\r\nknew the main points which the masters insisted upon, but though she\r\ncould show what was wrong with Philip\xe2\x80\x99s work she could not tell him how\r\nto put it right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully kind of you to take so much trouble with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, flushing awkwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople did the\r\nsame for me when I first came, I\xe2\x80\x99d do it for anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Price wants to indicate that she is giving you the advantage of\r\nher knowledge from a sense of duty rather than on account of any charms\r\nof your person,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clutton.\r\n\r\nMiss Price gave him a furious look, and went back to her own drawing.\r\nThe clock struck twelve, and the model with a cry of relief stepped\r\ndown from the stand.\r\n\r\nMiss Price gathered up her things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of us go to Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s for lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Philip, with a look\r\nat Clutton. \xe2\x80\x9cI always go home myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clutton.\r\n\r\nPhilip thanked him and made ready to go. On his way out Mrs. Otter\r\nasked him how he had been getting on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Fanny Price help you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI put you there because I know\r\nshe can do it if she likes. She\xe2\x80\x99s a disagreeable, ill-natured girl, and\r\nshe can\xe2\x80\x99t draw herself at all, but she knows the ropes, and she can be\r\nuseful to a newcomer if she cares to take the trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the way down the street Clutton said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made an impression on Fanny Price. You\xe2\x80\x99d better look out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed. He had never seen anyone on whom he wished less to make\r\nan impression. They came to the cheap little restaurant at which\r\nseveral of the students ate, and Clutton sat down at a table at which\r\nthree or four men were already seated. For a franc, they got an egg, a\r\nplate of meat, cheese, and a small bottle of wine. Coffee was extra.\r\nThey sat on the pavement, and yellow trams passed up and down the\r\nboulevard with a ceaseless ringing of bells.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clutton, as they took their seats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to introduce an old and trusted friend, Carey by name,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nClutton gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Flanagan, Mr. Lawson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed and went on with their conversation. They talked of a\r\nthousand things, and they all talked at once. No one paid the smallest\r\nattention to anyone else. They talked of the places they had been to in\r\nthe summer, of studios, of the various schools; they mentioned names\r\nwhich were unfamiliar to Philip, Monet, Manet, Renoir, Pissarro, Degas.\r\nPhilip listened with all his ears, and though he felt a little out of\r\nit, his heart leaped with exultation. The time flew. When Clutton got\r\nup he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll find me here this evening if you care to come. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind this about the best place for getting dyspepsia at the lowest cost\r\nin the Quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip walked down the Boulevard du Montparnasse. It was not at all\r\nlike the Paris he had seen in the spring during his visit to do the\r\naccounts of the Hotel St. Georges\xe2\x80\x94he thought already of that part of\r\nhis life with a shudder\xe2\x80\x94but reminded him of what he thought a\r\nprovincial town must be. There was an easy-going air about it, and a\r\nsunny spaciousness which invited the mind to day-dreaming. The trimness\r\nof the trees, the vivid whiteness of the houses, the breadth, were very\r\nagreeable; and he felt himself already thoroughly at home. He sauntered\r\nalong, staring at the people; there seemed an elegance about the most\r\nordinary, workmen with their broad red sashes and their wide trousers,\r\nlittle soldiers in dingy, charming uniforms. He came presently to the\r\nAvenue de l\xe2\x80\x99Observatoire, and he gave a sigh of pleasure at the\r\nmagnificent, yet so graceful, vista. He came to the gardens of the\r\nLuxembourg: children were playing, nurses with long ribbons walked\r\nslowly two by two, busy men passed through with satchels under their\r\narms, youths strangely dressed. The scene was formal and dainty; nature\r\nwas arranged and ordered, but so exquisitely, that nature unordered and\r\nunarranged seemed barbaric. Philip was enchanted. It excited him to\r\nstand on that spot of which he had read so much; it was classic ground\r\nto him; and he felt the awe and the delight which some old don might\r\nfeel when for the first time he looked on the smiling plain of Sparta.\r\n\r\nAs he wandered he chanced to see Miss Price sitting by herself on a\r\nbench. He hesitated, for he did not at that moment want to see anyone,\r\nand her uncouth way seemed out of place amid the happiness he felt\r\naround him; but he had divined her sensitiveness to affront, and since\r\nshe had seen him thought it would be polite to speak to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as he came up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnjoying myself. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I come here every day from four to five. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think one does\r\nany good if one works straight through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I sit down for a minute?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound very cordial,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not much of a one for saying pretty things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, a little disconcerted, was silent as he lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Clutton say anything about my work?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s no good, you know. He thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s a genius, but he isn\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo lazy, for one thing. Genius is an infinite capacity for taking\r\npains. The only thing is to peg away. If one only makes up one\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nbadly enough to do a thing one can\xe2\x80\x99t help doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a passionate strenuousness which was rather striking.\r\nShe wore a sailor hat of black straw, a white blouse which was not\r\nquite clean, and a brown skirt. She had no gloves on, and her hands\r\nwanted washing. She was so unattractive that Philip wished he had not\r\nbegun to talk to her. He could not make out whether she wanted him to\r\nstay or go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything I can for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said all at once, without\r\nreference to anything that had gone before. \xe2\x80\x9cI know how hard it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, then in a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come\r\nand have tea with me somewhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly and flushed. When she reddened her pasty skin\r\nacquired a curiously mottled look, like strawberries and cream that had\r\ngone bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thanks. What d\xe2\x80\x99you think I want tea for? I\xe2\x80\x99ve only just had\r\nlunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would pass the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you find it long you needn\xe2\x80\x99t bother about me, you know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind being left alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment two men passed, in brown velveteens, enormous trousers,\r\nand basque caps. They were young, but both wore beards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, are those art-students?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cThey might have stepped\r\nout of the Vie de Boheme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Price scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cFrenchmen haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworn things like that for thirty years, but the Americans from the Far\r\nWest buy those clothes and have themselves photographed the day after\r\nthey arrive in Paris. That\xe2\x80\x99s about as near to art as they ever get. But\r\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to them, they\xe2\x80\x99ve all got money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip liked the daring picturesqueness of the Americans\xe2\x80\x99 costume; he\r\nthought it showed the romantic spirit. Miss Price asked him the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be getting along to the studio,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to\r\nthe sketch classes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not know anything about them, and she told him that from\r\nfive to six every evening a model sat, from whom anyone who liked could\r\ngo and draw at the cost of fifty centimes. They had a different model\r\nevery day, and it was very good practice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re good enough yet for that. You\xe2\x80\x99d better wait a\r\nbit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got anything else to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey got up and walked to the studio. Philip could not tell from her\r\nmanner whether Miss Price wished him to walk with her or preferred to\r\nwalk alone. He remained from sheer embarrassment, not knowing how to\r\nleave her; but she would not talk; she answered his questions in an\r\nungracious manner.\r\n\r\nA man was standing at the studio door with a large dish into which each\r\nperson as he went in dropped his half franc. The studio was much fuller\r\nthan it had been in the morning, and there was not the preponderance of\r\nEnglish and Americans; nor were women there in so large a proportion.\r\nPhilip felt the assemblage was more the sort of thing he had expected.\r\nIt was very warm, and the air quickly grew fetid. It was an old man who\r\nsat this time, with a vast gray beard, and Philip tried to put into\r\npractice the little he had learned in the morning; but he made a poor\r\njob of it; he realised that he could not draw nearly as well as he\r\nthought. He glanced enviously at one or two sketches of men who sat\r\nnear him, and wondered whether he would ever be able to use the\r\ncharcoal with that mastery. The hour passed quickly. Not wishing to\r\npress himself upon Miss Price he sat down at some distance from her,\r\nand at the end, as he passed her on his way out, she asked him\r\nbrusquely how he had got on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99d condescended to come and sit near me I could have given you\r\nsome hints. I suppose you thought yourself too grand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that. I was afraid you\xe2\x80\x99d think me a nuisance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I do that I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you sharp enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip saw that in her uncouth way she was offering him help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, tomorrow I\xe2\x80\x99ll just force myself upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nPhilip went out and wondered what he should do with himself till\r\ndinner. He was eager to do something characteristic. Absinthe! of\r\ncourse it was indicated, and so, sauntering towards the station, he\r\nseated himself outside a cafe and ordered it. He drank with nausea and\r\nsatisfaction. He found the taste disgusting, but the moral effect\r\nmagnificent; he felt every inch an art-student; and since he drank on\r\nan empty stomach his spirits presently grew very high. He watched the\r\ncrowds, and felt all men were his brothers. He was happy. When he\r\nreached Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s the table at which Clutton sat was full, but as soon\r\nas he saw Philip limping along he called out to him. They made room.\r\nThe dinner was frugal, a plate of soup, a dish of meat, fruit, cheese,\r\nand half a bottle of wine; but Philip paid no attention to what he ate.\r\nHe took note of the men at the table. Flanagan was there again: he was\r\nan American, a short, snub-nosed youth with a jolly face and a laughing\r\nmouth. He wore a Norfolk jacket of bold pattern, a blue stock round his\r\nneck, and a tweed cap of fantastic shape. At that time impressionism\r\nreigned in the Latin Quarter, but its victory over the older schools\r\nwas still recent; and Carolus-Duran, Bouguereau, and their like were\r\nset up against Manet, Monet, and Degas. To appreciate these was still a\r\nsign of grace. Whistler was an influence strong with the English and\r\nhis compatriots, and the discerning collected Japanese prints. The old\r\nmasters were tested by new standards. The esteem in which Raphael had\r\nbeen for centuries held was a matter of derision to wise young men.\r\nThey offered to give all his works for Velasquez\xe2\x80\x99 head of Philip IV in\r\nthe National Gallery. Philip found that a discussion on art was raging.\r\nLawson, whom he had met at luncheon, sat opposite to him. He was a thin\r\nyouth with a freckled face and red hair. He had very bright green eyes.\r\nAs Philip sat down he fixed them on him and remarked suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRaphael was only tolerable when he painted other people\xe2\x80\x99s pictures.\r\nWhen he painted Peruginos or Pinturichios he was charming; when he\r\npainted Raphaels he was,\xe2\x80\x9d with a scornful shrug, \xe2\x80\x9cRaphael.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson spoke so aggressively that Philip was taken aback, but he was\r\nnot obliged to answer because Flanagan broke in impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, to hell with art!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get ginny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were ginny last night, Flanagan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to what I mean to be tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy being in\r\nPa-ris and thinking of nothing but art all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke with a\r\nbroad Western accent. \xe2\x80\x9cMy, it is good to be alive.\xe2\x80\x9d He gathered himself\r\ntogether and then banged his fist on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cTo hell with art, I\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou not only say it, but you say it with tiresome iteration,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nClutton severely.\r\n\r\nThere was another American at the table. He was dressed like those fine\r\nfellows whom Philip had seen that afternoon in the Luxembourg. He had a\r\nhandsome face, thin, ascetic, with dark eyes; he wore his fantastic\r\ngarb with the dashing air of a buccaneer. He had a vast quantity of\r\ndark hair which fell constantly over his eyes, and his most frequent\r\ngesture was to throw back his head dramatically to get some long wisp\r\nout of the way. He began to talk of the Olympia by Manet, which then\r\nhung in the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stood in front of it for an hour today, and I tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s not a\r\ngood picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson put down his knife and fork. His green eyes flashed fire, he\r\ngasped with rage; but he could be seen imposing calm upon himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting to hear the mind of the untutored savage,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell us why it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good picture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the American could answer someone else broke in vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say you can look at the painting of that flesh and say\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. I think the right breast is very well painted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right breast be damned,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Lawson. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmiracle of painting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to describe in detail the beauties of the picture, but at this\r\ntable at Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s they who spoke at length spoke for their own\r\nedification. No one listened to him. The American interrupted angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you think the head\xe2\x80\x99s good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson, white with passion now, began to defend the head; but Clutton,\r\nwho had been sitting in silence with a look on his face of\r\ngood-humoured scorn, broke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him the head. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want the head. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the\r\npicture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the head,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lawson. \xe2\x80\x9cTake the head and\r\nbe damned to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the black line?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the American, triumphantly pushing\r\nback a wisp of hair which nearly fell in his soup. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t see a\r\nblack line round objects in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, God, send down fire from heaven to consume the blasphemer,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLawson. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has nature got to do with it? No one knows what\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nnature and what isn\xe2\x80\x99t! The world sees nature through the eyes of the\r\nartist. Why, for centuries it saw horses jumping a fence with all their\r\nlegs extended, and by Heaven, sir, they were extended. It saw shadows\r\nblack until Monet discovered they were coloured, and by Heaven, sir,\r\nthey were black. If we choose to surround objects with a black line,\r\nthe world will see the black line, and there will be a black line; and\r\nif we paint grass red and cows blue, it\xe2\x80\x99ll see them red and blue, and,\r\nby Heaven, they will be red and blue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo hell with art,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Flanagan. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get ginny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson took no notice of the interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, when Olympia was shown at the Salon, Zola\xe2\x80\x94amid the\r\njeers of the Philistines and the hisses of the pompiers, the\r\nacademicians, and the public, Zola said: \xe2\x80\x98I look forward to the day\r\nwhen Manet\xe2\x80\x99s picture will hang in the Louvre opposite the Odalisque of\r\nIngres, and it will not be the Odalisque which will gain by\r\ncomparison.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99ll be there. Every day I see the time grow nearer. In\r\nten years the Olympia will be in the Louvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the American, using both hands now with a sudden\r\ndesperate attempt to get his hair once for all out of the way. \xe2\x80\x9cIn ten\r\nyears that picture will be dead. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a fashion of the moment. No\r\npicture can live that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got something which that picture misses by\r\na million miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat art can\xe2\x80\x99t exist without a moral element.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lawson furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it was that. He wants\r\nmorality.\xe2\x80\x9d He joined his hands and held them towards heaven in\r\nsupplication. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Christopher Columbus, Christopher Columbus, what did\r\nyou do when you discovered America?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuskin says\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut before he could add another word, Clutton rapped with the handle of\r\nhis knife imperiously on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a stern voice, and his huge nose positively\r\nwrinkled with passion, \xe2\x80\x9ca name has been mentioned which I never thought\r\nto hear again in decent society. Freedom of speech is all very well,\r\nbut we must observe the limits of common propriety. You may talk of\r\nBouguereau if you will: there is a cheerful disgustingness in the sound\r\nwhich excites laughter; but let us not sully our chaste lips with the\r\nnames of J. Ruskin, G. F. Watts, or E. B. Jones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was Ruskin anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Flanagan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was one of the Great Victorians. He was a master of English style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuskin\xe2\x80\x99s style\xe2\x80\x94a thing of shreds and purple patches,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, damn the Great Victorians. Whenever I open a paper and see\r\nDeath of a Great Victorian, I thank Heaven there\xe2\x80\x99s one more of them\r\ngone. Their only talent was longevity, and no artist should be allowed\r\nto live after he\xe2\x80\x99s forty; by then a man has done his best work, all he\r\ndoes after that is repetition. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it was the greatest luck\r\nin the world for them that Keats, Shelley, Bonnington, and Byron died\r\nearly? What a genius we should think Swinburne if he had perished on\r\nthe day the first series of Poems and Ballads was published!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suggestion pleased, for no one at the table was more than\r\ntwenty-four, and they threw themselves upon it with gusto. They were\r\nunanimous for once. They elaborated. Someone proposed a vast bonfire\r\nmade out of the works of the Forty Academicians into which the Great\r\nVictorians might be hurled on their fortieth birthday. The idea was\r\nreceived with acclamation. Carlyle and Ruskin, Tennyson, Browning, G.\r\nF. Watts, E. B. Jones, Dickens, Thackeray, they were hurried into the\r\nflames; Mr. Gladstone, John Bright, and Cobden; there was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscussion about George Meredith, but Matthew Arnold and Emerson were\r\ngiven up cheerfully. At last came Walter Pater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Walter Pater,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Philip.\r\n\r\nLawson stared at him for a moment with his green eyes and then nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite right, Walter Pater is the only justification for Mona\r\nLisa. D\xe2\x80\x99you know Cronshaw? He used to know Pater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s Cronshaw?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s a poet. He lives here. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the Lilas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLa Closerie des Lilas was a cafe to which they often went in the\r\nevening after dinner, and here Cronshaw was invariably to be found\r\nbetween the hours of nine at night and two in the morning. But Flanagan\r\nhad had enough of intellectual conversation for one evening, and when\r\nLawson made his suggestion, turned to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh gee, let\xe2\x80\x99s go where there are girls,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to the Gaite\r\nMontparnasse, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get ginny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather go and see Cronshaw and keep sober,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a general disturbance. Flanagan and two or three more went on\r\nto the music-hall, while Philip walked slowly with Clutton and Lawson\r\nto the Closerie des Lilas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go to the Gaite Montparnasse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nof the loveliest things in Paris. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to paint it one of these\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, influenced by Hayward, looked upon music-halls with scornful\r\neyes, but he had reached Paris at a time when their artistic\r\npossibilities were just discovered. The peculiarities of lighting, the\r\nmasses of dingy red and tarnished gold, the heaviness of the shadows\r\nand the decorative lines, offered a new theme; and half the studios in\r\nthe Quarter contained sketches made in one or other of the local\r\ntheatres. Men of letters, following in the painters\xe2\x80\x99 wake, conspired\r\nsuddenly to find artistic value in the turns; and red-nosed comedians\r\nwere lauded to the skies for their sense of character; fat female\r\nsingers, who had bawled obscurely for twenty years, were discovered to\r\npossess inimitable drollery; there were those who found an aesthetic\r\ndelight in performing dogs; while others exhausted their vocabulary to\r\nextol the distinction of conjurers and trick-cyclists. The crowd too,\r\nunder another influence, was become an object of sympathetic interest.\r\nWith Hayward, Philip had disdained humanity in the mass; he adopted the\r\nattitude of one who wraps himself in solitariness and watches with\r\ndisgust the antics of the vulgar; but Clutton and Lawson talked of the\r\nmultitude with enthusiasm. They described the seething throng that\r\nfilled the various fairs of Paris, the sea of faces, half seen in the\r\nglare of acetylene, half hidden in the darkness, and the blare of\r\ntrumpets, the hooting of whistles, the hum of voices. What they said\r\nwas new and strange to Philip. They told him about Cronshaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever read any of his work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came out in The Yellow Book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked upon him, as painters often do writers, with contempt\r\nbecause he was a layman, with tolerance because he practised an art,\r\nand with awe because he used a medium in which themselves felt\r\nill-at-ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary fellow. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find him a bit disappointing at\r\nfirst, he only comes out at his best when he\xe2\x80\x99s drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the nuisance is,\xe2\x80\x9d added Clutton, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it takes him a devil of a\r\ntime to get drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the cafe Lawson told Philip that they would have\r\nto go in. There was hardly a bite in the autumn air, but Cronshaw had a\r\nmorbid fear of draughts and even in the warmest weather sat inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows everyone worth knowing,\xe2\x80\x9d Lawson explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knew Pater and\r\nOscar Wilde, and he knows Mallarme and all those fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe object of their search sat in the most sheltered corner of the\r\ncafe, with his coat on and the collar turned up. He wore his hat\r\npressed well down on his forehead so that he should avoid cold air. He\r\nwas a big man, stout but not obese, with a round face, a small\r\nmoustache, and little, rather stupid eyes. His head did not seem quite\r\nbig enough for his body. It looked like a pea uneasily poised on an\r\negg. He was playing dominoes with a Frenchman, and greeted the\r\nnew-comers with a quiet smile; he did not speak, but as if to make room\r\nfor them pushed away the little pile of saucers on the table which\r\nindicated the number of drinks he had already consumed. He nodded to\r\nPhilip when he was introduced to him, and went on with the game.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the language was small, but he knew enough to\r\ntell that Cronshaw, although he had lived in Paris for several years,\r\nspoke French execrably.\r\n\r\nAt last he leaned back with a smile of triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe vous ai battu,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an abominable accent. \xe2\x80\x9cGarcong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe called the waiter and turned to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust out from England? See any cricket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was a little confused at the unexpected question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCronshaw knows the averages of every first-class cricketer for the\r\nlast twenty years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman left them for friends at another table, and Cronshaw,\r\nwith the lazy enunciation which was one of his peculiarities, began to\r\ndiscourse on the relative merits of Kent and Lancashire. He told them\r\nof the last test match he had seen and described the course of the game\r\nwicket by wicket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing I miss in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he finished the\r\nbock which the waiter had brought. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t get any cricket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was disappointed, and Lawson, pardonably anxious to show off one\r\nof the celebrities of the Quarter, grew impatient. Cronshaw was taking\r\nhis time to wake up that evening, though the saucers at his side\r\nindicated that he had at least made an honest attempt to get drunk.\r\nClutton watched the scene with amusement. He fancied there was\r\nsomething of affectation in Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s minute knowledge of cricket; he\r\nliked to tantalise people by talking to them of things that obviously\r\nbored them; Clutton threw in a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Mallarme lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCronshaw looked at him slowly, as if he were turning the inquiry over\r\nin his mind, and before he answered rapped on the marble table with one\r\nof the saucers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring my bottle of whiskey,\xe2\x80\x9d he called out. He turned again to Philip.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI keep my own bottle of whiskey. I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to pay fifty centimes\r\nfor every thimbleful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter brought the bottle, and Cronshaw held it up to the light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been drinking it. Waiter, who\xe2\x80\x99s been helping himself to my\r\nwhiskey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais personne, Monsieur Cronshaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made a mark on it last night, and look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur made a mark, but he kept on drinking after that. At that rate\r\nMonsieur wastes his time in making marks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter was a jovial fellow and knew Cronshaw intimately. Cronshaw\r\ngazed at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you give me your word of honour as a nobleman and a gentleman that\r\nnobody but I has been drinking my whiskey, I\xe2\x80\x99ll accept your statement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis remark, translated literally into the crudest French, sounded very\r\nfunny, and the lady at the comptoir could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIl est impayable,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nCronshaw, hearing her, turned a sheepish eye upon her; she was stout,\r\nmatronly, and middle-aged; and solemnly kissed his hand to her. She\r\nshrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear not, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cI have passed the age when I am\r\ntempted by forty-five and gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe poured himself out some whiskey and water, and slowly drank it. He\r\nwiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe talked very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson and Clutton knew that Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s remark was an answer to the\r\nquestion about Mallarme. Cronshaw often went to the gatherings on\r\nTuesday evenings when the poet received men of letters and painters,\r\nand discoursed with subtle oratory on any subject that was suggested to\r\nhim. Cronshaw had evidently been there lately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe talked very well, but he talked nonsense. He talked about art as\r\nthough it were the most important thing in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, what are we here for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you\xe2\x80\x99re here for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It is no business of mine. But art\r\nis a luxury. Men attach importance only to self-preservation and the\r\npropagation of their species. It is only when these instincts are\r\nsatisfied that they consent to occupy themselves with the entertainment\r\nwhich is provided for them by writers, painters, and poets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCronshaw stopped for a moment to drink. He had pondered for twenty\r\nyears the problem whether he loved liquor because it made him talk or\r\nwhether he loved conversation because it made him thirsty.\r\n\r\nThen he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote a poem yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout being asked he began to recite it, very slowly, marking the\r\nrhythm with an extended forefinger. It was possibly a very fine poem,\r\nbut at that moment a young woman came in. She had scarlet lips, and it\r\nwas plain that the vivid colour of her cheeks was not due to the\r\nvulgarity of nature; she had blackened her eyelashes and eyebrows, and\r\npainted both eyelids a bold blue, which was continued to a triangle at\r\nthe corner of the eyes. It was fantastic and amusing. Her dark hair was\r\ndone over her ears in the fashion made popular by Mlle. Cleo de Merode.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes wandered to her, and Cronshaw, having finished the\r\nrecitation of his verses, smiled upon him indulgently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not listening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not blame you, for you have given an apt illustration of the\r\nstatement I just made. What is art beside love? I respect and applaud\r\nyour indifference to fine poetry when you can contemplate the\r\nmeretricious charms of this young person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe passed by the table at which they were sitting, and he took her\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit by my side, dear child, and let us play the divine comedy\r\nof love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFichez-moi la paix,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and pushing him on one side continued\r\nher perambulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, with a wave of the hand, \xe2\x80\x9cis merely the refuge\r\nwhich the ingenious have invented, when they were supplied with food\r\nand women, to escape the tediousness of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCronshaw filled his glass again, and began to talk at length. He spoke\r\nwith rotund delivery. He chose his words carefully. He mingled wisdom\r\nand nonsense in the most astounding manner, gravely making fun of his\r\nhearers at one moment, and at the next playfully giving them sound\r\nadvice. He talked of art, and literature, and life. He was by turns\r\ndevout and obscene, merry and lachrymose. He grew remarkably drunk, and\r\nthen he began to recite poetry, his own and Milton\xe2\x80\x99s, his own and\r\nShelley\xe2\x80\x99s, his own and Kit Marlowe\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nAt last Lawson, exhausted, got up to go home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nClutton, the most silent of them all, remained behind listening, with a\r\nsardonic smile on his lips, to Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s maunderings. Lawson\r\naccompanied Philip to his hotel and then bade him good-night. But when\r\nPhilip got to bed he could not sleep. All these new ideas that had been\r\nflung before him carelessly seethed in his brain. He was tremendously\r\nexcited. He felt in himself great powers. He had never before been so\r\nself-confident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I shall be a great artist,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel it in\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA thrill passed through him as another thought came, but even to\r\nhimself he would not put it into words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George, I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve got genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was in fact very drunk, but as he had not taken more than one glass\r\nof beer, it could have been due only to a more dangerous intoxicant\r\nthan alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesdays and Fridays masters spent the morning at Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\ncriticising the work done. In France the painter earns little unless he\r\npaints portraits and is patronised by rich Americans; and men of\r\nreputation are glad to increase their incomes by spending two or three\r\nhours once a week at one of the numerous studios where art is taught.\r\nTuesday was the day upon which Michel Rollin came to Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s. He was\r\nan elderly man, with a white beard and a florid complexion, who had\r\npainted a number of decorations for the State, but these were an object\r\nof derision to the students he instructed: he was a disciple of Ingres,\r\nimpervious to the progress of art and angrily impatient with that tas\r\nde farceurs whose names were Manet, Degas, Monet, and Sisley; but he\r\nwas an excellent teacher, helpful, polite, and encouraging. Foinet, on\r\nthe other hand, who visited the studio on Fridays, was a difficult man\r\nto get on with. He was a small, shrivelled person, with bad teeth and a\r\nbilious air, an untidy gray beard, and savage eyes; his voice was high\r\nand his tone sarcastic. He had had pictures bought by the Luxembourg,\r\nand at twenty-five looked forward to a great career; but his talent was\r\ndue to youth rather than to personality, and for twenty years he had\r\ndone nothing but repeat the landscape which had brought him his early\r\nsuccess. When he was reproached with monotony, he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorot only painted one thing. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was envious of everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s success, and had a peculiar, personal\r\nloathing of the impressionists; for he looked upon his own failure as\r\ndue to the mad fashion which had attracted the public, sale bete, to\r\ntheir works. The genial disdain of Michel Rollin, who called them\r\nimpostors, was answered by him with vituperation, of which crapule and\r\ncanaille were the least violent items; he amused himself with abuse of\r\ntheir private lives, and with sardonic humour, with blasphemous and\r\nobscene detail, attacked the legitimacy of their births and the purity\r\nof their conjugal relations: he used an Oriental imagery and an\r\nOriental emphasis to accentuate his ribald scorn. Nor did he conceal\r\nhis contempt for the students whose work he examined. By them he was\r\nhated and feared; the women by his brutal sarcasm he reduced often to\r\ntears, which again aroused his ridicule; and he remained at the studio,\r\nnotwithstanding the protests of those who suffered too bitterly from\r\nhis attacks, because there could be no doubt that he was one of the\r\nbest masters in Paris. Sometimes the old model who kept the school\r\nventured to remonstrate with him, but his expostulations quickly gave\r\nway before the violent insolence of the painter to abject apologies.\r\n\r\nIt was Foinet with whom Philip first came in contact. He was already in\r\nthe studio when Philip arrived. He went round from easel to easel, with\r\nMrs. Otter, the massiere, by his side to interpret his remarks for the\r\nbenefit of those who could not understand French. Fanny Price, sitting\r\nnext to Philip, was working feverishly. Her face was sallow with\r\nnervousness, and every now and then she stopped to wipe her hands on\r\nher blouse; for they were hot with anxiety. Suddenly she turned to\r\nPhilip with an anxious look, which she tried to hide by a sullen frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think it\xe2\x80\x99s good?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, nodding at her drawing.\r\n\r\nPhilip got up and looked at it. He was astounded; he felt she must have\r\nno eye at all; the thing was hopelessly out of drawing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could draw half as well myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to, you\xe2\x80\x99ve only just come. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit too much to\r\nexpect that you should draw as well as I do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here two years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny Price puzzled Philip. Her conceit was stupendous. Philip had\r\nalready discovered that everyone in the studio cordially disliked her;\r\nand it was no wonder, for she seemed to go out of her way to wound\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI complained to Mrs. Otter about Foinet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said now. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last two\r\nweeks he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t looked at my drawings. He spends about half an hour on\r\nMrs. Otter because she\xe2\x80\x99s the massiere. After all I pay as much as\r\nanybody else, and I suppose my money\xe2\x80\x99s as good as theirs. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nwhy I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get as much attention as anybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up her charcoal again, but in a moment put it down with a\r\ngroan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do any more now. I\xe2\x80\x99m so frightfully nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at Foinet, who was coming towards them with Mrs. Otter. Mrs.\r\nOtter, meek, mediocre, and self-satisfied, wore an air of importance.\r\nFoinet sat down at the easel of an untidy little Englishwoman called\r\nRuth Chalice. She had the fine black eyes, languid but passionate, the\r\nthin face, ascetic but sensual, the skin like old ivory, which under\r\nthe influence of Burne-Jones were cultivated at that time by young\r\nladies in Chelsea. Foinet seemed in a pleasant mood; he did not say\r\nmuch to her, but with quick, determined strokes of her charcoal pointed\r\nout her errors. Miss Chalice beamed with pleasure when he rose. He came\r\nto Clutton, and by this time Philip was nervous too but Mrs. Otter had\r\npromised to make things easy for him. Foinet stood for a moment in\r\nfront of Clutton\xe2\x80\x99s work, biting his thumb silently, then\r\nabsent-mindedly spat out upon the canvas the little piece of skin which\r\nhe had bitten off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fine line,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, indicating with his thumb what\r\npleased him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to learn to draw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClutton did not answer, but looked at the master with his usual air of\r\nsardonic indifference to the world\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to think you have at least a trace of talent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Otter, who did not like Clutton, pursed her lips. She did not see\r\nanything out of the way in his work. Foinet sat down and went into\r\ntechnical details. Mrs. Otter grew rather tired of standing. Clutton\r\ndid not say anything, but nodded now and then, and Foinet felt with\r\nsatisfaction that he grasped what he said and the reasons of it; most\r\nof them listened to him, but it was clear they never understood. Then\r\nFoinet got up and came to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only arrived two days ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Otter hurried to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbeginner. He\xe2\x80\x99s never studied before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCa se voit,\xe2\x80\x9d the master said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne sees that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed on, and Mrs. Otter murmured to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the young lady I told you about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her as though she were some repulsive animal, and his\r\nvoice grew more rasping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that you do not think I pay enough attention to you. You\r\nhave been complaining to the massiere. Well, show me this work to which\r\nyou wish me to give attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny Price coloured. The blood under her unhealthy skin seemed to be\r\nof a strange purple. Without answering she pointed to the drawing on\r\nwhich she had been at work since the beginning of the week. Foinet sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you wish me to say to you? Do you wish me to tell you it\r\nis good? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Do you wish me to tell you it is well drawn? It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t. Do you wish me to say it has merit? It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Do you wish me to\r\nshow you what is wrong with it? It is all wrong. Do you wish me to tell\r\nyou what to do with it? Tear it up. Are you satisfied now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Price became very white. She was furious because he had said all\r\nthis before Mrs. Otter. Though she had been in France so long and could\r\nunderstand French well enough, she could hardly speak two words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got no right to treat me like that. My money\xe2\x80\x99s as good as anyone\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s. I pay him to teach me. That\xe2\x80\x99s not teaching me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she say? What does she say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Foinet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Otter hesitated to translate, and Miss Price repeated in execrable\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe vous paye pour m\xe2\x80\x99apprendre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes flashed with rage, he raised his voice and shook his fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais, nom de Dieu, I can\xe2\x80\x99t teach you. I could more easily teach a\r\ncamel.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to Mrs. Otter. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk her, does she do this for\r\namusement, or does she expect to earn money by it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to earn my living as an artist,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Price answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is my duty to tell you that you are wasting your time. It\r\nwould not matter that you have no talent, talent does not run about the\r\nstreets in these days, but you have not the beginning of an aptitude.\r\nHow long have you been here? A child of five after two lessons would\r\ndraw better than you do. I only say one thing to you, give up this\r\nhopeless attempt. You\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to earn your living as a bonne a\r\ntout faire than as a painter. Look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized a piece of charcoal, and it broke as he applied it to the\r\npaper. He cursed, and with the stump drew great firm lines. He drew\r\nrapidly and spoke at the same time, spitting out the words with venom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, those arms are not the same length. That knee, it\xe2\x80\x99s grotesque. I\r\ntell you a child of five. You see, she\xe2\x80\x99s not standing on her legs. That\r\nfoot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith each word the angry pencil made a mark, and in a moment the\r\ndrawing upon which Fanny Price had spent so much time and eager trouble\r\nwas unrecognisable, a confusion of lines and smudges. At last he flung\r\ndown the charcoal and stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my advice, Mademoiselle, try dressmaking.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at his\r\nwatch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s twelve. A la semaine prochaine, messieurs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Price gathered up her things slowly. Philip waited behind after\r\nthe others to say to her something consolatory. He could think of\r\nnothing but:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry. What a beast that man is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned on him savagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting about for? When I want your sympathy I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nask for it. Please get out of my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked past him, out of the studio, and Philip, with a shrug of the\r\nshoulders, limped along to Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s for luncheon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt served her right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson, when Philip told him what had\r\nhappened. \xe2\x80\x9cIll-tempered slut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson was very sensitive to criticism and, in order to avoid it, never\r\nwent to the studio when Foinet was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want other people\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of my work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nmyself if it\xe2\x80\x99s good or bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t want other people\xe2\x80\x99s bad opinion of your work,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Clutton dryly.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Philip thought he would go to the Luxembourg to see\r\nthe pictures, and walking through the garden he saw Fanny Price sitting\r\nin her accustomed seat. He was sore at the rudeness with which she had\r\nmet his well-meant attempt to say something pleasant, and passed as\r\nthough he had not caught sight of her. But she got up at once and came\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you trying to cut me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, of course not. I thought perhaps you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be spoken to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to have a look at the Manet, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard so much about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to come with you? I know the Luxembourg rather well.\r\nI could show you one or two good things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe understood that, unable to bring herself to apologise directly, she\r\nmade this offer as amends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully kind of you. I should like it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t say yes if you\xe2\x80\x99d rather go alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked towards the gallery. Caillebotte\xe2\x80\x99s collection had lately\r\nbeen placed on view, and the student for the first time had the\r\nopportunity to examine at his ease the works of the impressionists.\r\nTill then it had been possible to see them only at Durand-Ruel\xe2\x80\x99s shop\r\nin the Rue Lafitte (and the dealer, unlike his fellows in England, who\r\nadopt towards the painter an attitude of superiority, was always\r\npleased to show the shabbiest student whatever he wanted to see), or at\r\nhis private house, to which it was not difficult to get a card of\r\nadmission on Tuesdays, and where you might see pictures of world-wide\r\nreputation. Miss Price led Philip straight up to Manet\xe2\x80\x99s Olympia. He\r\nlooked at it in astonished silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can take it from me that it\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing in the gallery except\r\nperhaps Whistler\xe2\x80\x99s portrait of his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a certain time to contemplate the masterpiece and then\r\ntook him to a picture representing a railway-station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, here\xe2\x80\x99s a Monet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Gare St. Lazare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the railway lines aren\xe2\x80\x99t parallel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a haughty air.\r\n\r\nPhilip felt ashamed of himself. Fanny Price had picked up the glib\r\nchatter of the studios and had no difficulty in impressing Philip with\r\nthe extent of her knowledge. She proceeded to explain the pictures to\r\nhim, superciliously but not without insight, and showed him what the\r\npainters had attempted and what he must look for. She talked with much\r\ngesticulation of the thumb, and Philip, to whom all she said was new,\r\nlistened with profound but bewildered interest. Till now he had\r\nworshipped Watts and Burne-Jones. The pretty colour of the first, the\r\naffected drawing of the second, had entirely satisfied his aesthetic\r\nsensibilities. Their vague idealism, the suspicion of a philosophical\r\nidea which underlay the titles they gave their pictures, accorded very\r\nwell with the functions of art as from his diligent perusal of Ruskin\r\nhe understood it; but here was something quite different: here was no\r\nmoral appeal; and the contemplation of these works could help no one to\r\nlead a purer and a higher life. He was puzzled.\r\n\r\nAt last he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\xe2\x80\x99m simply dead. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can absorb\r\nanything more profitably. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go and sit down on one of the benches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better not to take too much art at a time,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Price answered.\r\n\r\nWhen they got outside he thanked her warmly for the trouble she had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little ungraciously. \xe2\x80\x9cI do it\r\nbecause I enjoy it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Louvre tomorrow if you like, and\r\nthen I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to Durand-Ruel\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re really awfully good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think me such a beast as the most of them do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey think they\xe2\x80\x99ll drive me away from the studio; but they won\xe2\x80\x99t; I\r\nshall stay there just exactly as long as it suits me. All that this\r\nmorning, it was Lucy Otter\xe2\x80\x99s doing, I know it was. She always has hated\r\nme. She thought after that I\xe2\x80\x99d take myself off. I daresay she\xe2\x80\x99d like me\r\nto go. She\xe2\x80\x99s afraid I know too much about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Price told him a long, involved story, which made out that Mrs.\r\nOtter, a humdrum and respectable little person, had scabrous intrigues.\r\nThen she talked of Ruth Chalice, the girl whom Foinet had praised that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been with every one of the fellows at the studio. She\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nbetter than a street-walker. And she\xe2\x80\x99s dirty. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a bath for\r\na month. I know it for a fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip listened uncomfortably. He had heard already that various\r\nrumours were in circulation about Miss Chalice; but it was ridiculous\r\nto suppose that Mrs. Otter, living with her mother, was anything but\r\nrigidly virtuous. The woman walking by his side with her malignant\r\nlying positively horrified him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what they say. I shall go on just the same. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot it in me. I feel I\xe2\x80\x99m an artist. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner kill myself than give it\r\nup. Oh, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be the first they\xe2\x80\x99ve all laughed at in the schools and\r\nthen he\xe2\x80\x99s turned out the only genius of the lot. Art\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing I\r\ncare for, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to give my whole life to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a question\r\nof sticking to it and pegging away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe found discreditable motives for everyone who would not take her at\r\nher own estimate of herself. She detested Clutton. She told Philip that\r\nhis friend had no talent really; it was just flashy and superficial; he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t compose a figure to save his life. And Lawson:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle beast, with his red hair and his freckles. He\xe2\x80\x99s so afraid of\r\nFoinet that he won\xe2\x80\x99t let him see his work. After all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t funk it,\r\ndo I? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what Foinet says to me, I know I\xe2\x80\x99m a real artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached the street in which she lived, and with a sigh of relief\r\nPhilip left her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding when Miss Price on the following Sunday offered to\r\ntake him to the Louvre Philip accepted. She showed him Mona Lisa. He\r\nlooked at it with a slight feeling of disappointment, but he had read\r\ntill he knew by heart the jewelled words with which Walter Pater has\r\nadded beauty to the most famous picture in the world; and these now he\r\nrepeated to Miss Price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all literature,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nget away from that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed him the Rembrandts, and she said many appropriate things\r\nabout them. She stood in front of the Disciples at Emmaus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you feel the beauty of that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll know something\r\nabout painting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed him the Odalisque and La Source of Ingres. Fanny Price was a\r\nperemptory guide, she would not let him look at the things he wished,\r\nand attempted to force his admiration for all she admired. She was\r\ndesperately in earnest with her study of art, and when Philip, passing\r\nin the Long Gallery a window that looked out on the Tuileries, gay,\r\nsunny, and urbane, like a picture by Raffaelli, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, how jolly! Do let\xe2\x80\x99s stop here a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said, indifferently: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve come here to\r\nlook at pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe autumn air, blithe and vivacious, elated Philip; and when towards\r\nmid-day they stood in the great court-yard of the Louvre, he felt\r\ninclined to cry like Flanagan: To hell with art.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, do let\xe2\x80\x99s go to one of those restaurants in the Boul\xe2\x80\x99 Mich\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhave a snack together, shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\nMiss Price gave him a suspicious look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my lunch waiting for me at home,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. You can eat it tomorrow. Do let me stand you a\r\nlunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would give me pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, smiling.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the river, and at the corner of the Boulevard St. Michel\r\nthere was a restaurant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go there, it looks too expensive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked on firmly, and Philip was obliged to follow. A few steps\r\nbrought them to a smaller restaurant, where a dozen people were already\r\nlunching on the pavement under an awning; on the window was announced\r\nin large white letters: Dejeuner 1.25, vin compris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything cheaper than this, and it looks quite all\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat down at a vacant table and waited for the omelette which was\r\nthe first article on the bill of fare. Philip gazed with delight upon\r\nthe passers-by. His heart went out to them. He was tired but very\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, look at that man in the blouse. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he ripping!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Miss Price, and to his astonishment saw that she was\r\nlooking down at her plate, regardless of the passing spectacle, and two\r\nheavy tears were rolling down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you say anything to me I shall get up and go at once,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nHe was entirely puzzled, but fortunately at that moment the omelette\r\ncame. He divided it in two and they began to eat. Philip did his best\r\nto talk of indifferent things, and it seemed as though Miss Price were\r\nmaking an effort on her side to be agreeable; but the luncheon was not\r\naltogether a success. Philip was squeamish, and the way in which Miss\r\nPrice ate took his appetite away. She ate noisily, greedily, a little\r\nlike a wild beast in a menagerie, and after she had finished each\r\ncourse rubbed the plate with pieces of bread till it was white and\r\nshining, as if she did not wish to lose a single drop of gravy. They\r\nhad Camembert cheese, and it disgusted Philip to see that she ate rind\r\nand all of the portion that was given her. She could not have eaten\r\nmore ravenously if she were starving.\r\n\r\nMiss Price was unaccountable, and having parted from her on one day\r\nwith friendliness he could never tell whether on the next she would not\r\nbe sulky and uncivil; but he learned a good deal from her: though she\r\ncould not draw well herself, she knew all that could be taught, and her\r\nconstant suggestions helped his progress. Mrs. Otter was useful to him\r\ntoo, and sometimes Miss Chalice criticised his work; he learned from\r\nthe glib loquacity of Lawson and from the example of Clutton. But Fanny\r\nPrice hated him to take suggestions from anyone but herself, and when\r\nhe asked her help after someone else had been talking to him she would\r\nrefuse with brutal rudeness. The other fellows, Lawson, Clutton,\r\nFlanagan, chaffed him about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou be careful, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s in love with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\nThe thought that Miss Price could be in love with anyone was\r\npreposterous. It made him shudder when he thought of her uncomeliness,\r\nthe bedraggled hair and the dirty hands, the brown dress she always\r\nwore, stained and ragged at the hem: he supposed she was hard up, they\r\nwere all hard up, but she might at least be clean; and it was surely\r\npossible with a needle and thread to make her skirt tidy.\r\n\r\nPhilip began to sort his impressions of the people he was thrown in\r\ncontact with. He was not so ingenuous as in those days which now seemed\r\nso long ago at Heidelberg, and, beginning to take a more deliberate\r\ninterest in humanity, he was inclined to examine and to criticise. He\r\nfound it difficult to know Clutton any better after seeing him every\r\nday for three months than on the first day of their acquaintance. The\r\ngeneral impression at the studio was that he was able; it was supposed\r\nthat he would do great things, and he shared the general opinion; but\r\nwhat exactly he was going to do neither he nor anybody else quite knew.\r\nHe had worked at several studios before Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s, at Julian\xe2\x80\x99s, the\r\nBeaux Arts, and MacPherson\xe2\x80\x99s, and was remaining longer at Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthan anywhere because he found himself more left alone. He was not fond\r\nof showing his work, and unlike most of the young men who were studying\r\nart neither sought nor gave advice. It was said that in the little\r\nstudio in the Rue Campagne Premiere, which served him for work-room and\r\nbed-room, he had wonderful pictures which would make his reputation if\r\nonly he could be induced to exhibit them. He could not afford a model\r\nbut painted still life, and Lawson constantly talked of a plate of\r\napples which he declared was a masterpiece. He was fastidious, and,\r\naiming at something he did not quite fully grasp, was constantly\r\ndissatisfied with his work as a whole: perhaps a part would please him,\r\nthe forearm or the leg and foot of a figure, a glass or a cup in a\r\nstill-life; and he would cut this out and keep it, destroying the rest\r\nof the canvas; so that when people invited themselves to see his work\r\nhe could truthfully answer that he had not a single picture to show. In\r\nBrittany he had come across a painter whom nobody else had heard of, a\r\nqueer fellow who had been a stockbroker and taken up painting at\r\nmiddle-age, and he was greatly influenced by his work. He was turning\r\nhis back on the impressionists and working out for himself painfully an\r\nindividual way not only of painting but of seeing. Philip felt in him\r\nsomething strangely original.\r\n\r\nAt Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s where they ate, and in the evening at the Versailles or at\r\nthe Closerie des Lilas Clutton was inclined to taciturnity. He sat\r\nquietly, with a sardonic expression on his gaunt face, and spoke only\r\nwhen the opportunity occurred to throw in a witticism. He liked a butt\r\nand was most cheerful when someone was there on whom he could exercise\r\nhis sarcasm. He seldom talked of anything but painting, and then only\r\nwith the one or two persons whom he thought worth while. Philip\r\nwondered whether there was in him really anything: his reticence, the\r\nhaggard look of him, the pungent humour, seemed to suggest personality,\r\nbut might be no more than an effective mask which covered nothing.\r\n\r\nWith Lawson on the other hand Philip soon grew intimate. He had a\r\nvariety of interests which made him an agreeable companion. He read\r\nmore than most of the students and though his income was small, loved\r\nto buy books. He lent them willingly; and Philip became acquainted with\r\nFlaubert and Balzac, with Verlaine, Heredia, and Villiers de l\xe2\x80\x99Isle\r\nAdam. They went to plays together and sometimes to the gallery of the\r\nOpera Comique. There was the Odeon quite near them, and Philip soon\r\nshared his friend\xe2\x80\x99s passion for the tragedians of Louis XIV and the\r\nsonorous Alexandrine. In the Rue Taitbout were the Concerts Rouge,\r\nwhere for seventy-five centimes they could hear excellent music and get\r\ninto the bargain something which it was quite possible to drink: the\r\nseats were uncomfortable, the place was crowded, the air thick with\r\ncaporal horrible to breathe, but in their young enthusiasm they were\r\nindifferent. Sometimes they went to the Bal Bullier. On these occasions\r\nFlanagan accompanied them. His excitability and his roisterous\r\nenthusiasm made them laugh. He was an excellent dancer, and before they\r\nhad been ten minutes in the room he was prancing round with some little\r\nshop-girl whose acquaintance he had just made.\r\n\r\nThe desire of all of them was to have a mistress. It was part of the\r\nparaphernalia of the art-student in Paris. It gave consideration in the\r\neyes of one\xe2\x80\x99s fellows. It was something to boast about. But the\r\ndifficulty was that they had scarcely enough money to keep themselves,\r\nand though they argued that French-women were so clever it cost no more\r\nto keep two then one, they found it difficult to meet young women who\r\nwere willing to take that view of the circumstances. They had to\r\ncontent themselves for the most part with envying and abusing the\r\nladies who received protection from painters of more settled\r\nrespectability than their own. It was extraordinary how difficult these\r\nthings were in Paris. Lawson would become acquainted with some young\r\nthing and make an appointment; for twenty-four hours he would be all in\r\na flutter and describe the charmer at length to everyone he met; but\r\nshe never by any chance turned up at the time fixed. He would come to\r\nGravier\xe2\x80\x99s very late, ill-tempered, and exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it, another rabbit! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it is they don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nme. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s because I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak French well, or my red hair.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too sickening to have spent over a year in Paris without getting\r\nhold of anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t go the right way to work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flanagan.\r\n\r\nHe had a long and enviable list of triumphs to narrate, and though they\r\ntook leave not to believe all he said, evidence forced them to\r\nacknowledge that he did not altogether lie. But he sought no permanent\r\narrangement. He only had two years in Paris: he had persuaded his\r\npeople to let him come and study art instead of going to college; but\r\nat the end of that period he was to return to Seattle and go into his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s business. He had made up his mind to get as much fun as\r\npossible into the time, and demanded variety rather than duration in\r\nhis love affairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you get hold of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson furiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no difficulty about that, sonny,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Flanagan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just\r\ngo right in. The difficulty is to get rid of them. That\xe2\x80\x99s where you\r\nwant tact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was too much occupied with his work, the books he was reading,\r\nthe plays he saw, the conversation he listened to, to trouble himself\r\nwith the desire for female society. He thought there would be plenty of\r\ntime for that when he could speak French more glibly.\r\n\r\nIt was more than a year now since he had seen Miss Wilkinson, and\r\nduring his first weeks in Paris he had been too busy to answer a letter\r\nshe had written to him just before he left Blackstable. When another\r\ncame, knowing it would be full of reproaches and not being just then in\r\nthe mood for them, he put it aside, intending to open it later; but he\r\nforgot and did not run across it till a month afterwards, when he was\r\nturning out a drawer to find some socks that had no holes in them. He\r\nlooked at the unopened letter with dismay. He was afraid that Miss\r\nWilkinson had suffered a good deal, and it made him feel a brute; but\r\nshe had probably got over the suffering by now, at all events the worst\r\nof it. It suggested itself to him that women were often very emphatic\r\nin their expressions. These did not mean so much as when men used them.\r\nHe had quite made up his mind that nothing would induce him ever to see\r\nher again. He had not written for so long that it seemed hardly worth\r\nwhile to write now. He made up his mind not to read the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay she won\xe2\x80\x99t write again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nseeing the thing\xe2\x80\x99s over. After all, she was old enough to be my mother;\r\nshe ought to have known better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor an hour or two he felt a little uncomfortable. His attitude was\r\nobviously the right one, but he could not help a feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction with the whole business. Miss Wilkinson, however, did\r\nnot write again; nor did she, as he absurdly feared, suddenly appear in\r\nParis to make him ridiculous before his friends. In a little while he\r\nclean forgot her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he definitely forsook his old gods. The amazement with which\r\nat first he had looked upon the works of the impressionists, changed to\r\nadmiration; and presently he found himself talking as emphatically as\r\nthe rest on the merits of Manet, Monet, and Degas. He bought a\r\nphotograph of a drawing by Ingres of the Odalisque and a photograph of\r\nthe Olympia. They were pinned side by side over his washing-stand so\r\nthat he could contemplate their beauty while he shaved. He knew now\r\nquite positively that there had been no painting of landscape before\r\nMonet; and he felt a real thrill when he stood in front of Rembrandt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDisciples at Emmaus or Velasquez\xe2\x80\x99 Lady with the Flea-bitten Nose. That\r\nwas not her real name, but by that she was distinguished at Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto emphasise the picture\xe2\x80\x99s beauty notwithstanding the somewhat\r\nrevolting peculiarity of the sitter\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. With Ruskin,\r\nBurne-Jones, and Watts, he had put aside his bowler hat and the neat\r\nblue tie with white spots which he had worn on coming to Paris; and now\r\ndisported himself in a soft, broad-brimmed hat, a flowing black cravat,\r\nand a cape of romantic cut. He walked along the Boulevard du\r\nMontparnasse as though he had known it all his life, and by virtuous\r\nperseverance he had learnt to drink absinthe without distaste. He was\r\nletting his hair grow, and it was only because Nature is unkind and has\r\nno regard for the immortal longings of youth that he did not attempt a\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip soon realised that the spirit which informed his friends was\r\nCronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s. It was from him that Lawson got his paradoxes; and even\r\nClutton, who strained after individuality, expressed himself in the\r\nterms he had insensibly acquired from the older man. It was his ideas\r\nthat they bandied about at table, and on his authority they formed\r\ntheir judgments. They made up for the respect with which unconsciously\r\nthey treated him by laughing at his foibles and lamenting his vices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, poor old Cronshaw will never do any good,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite hopeless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey prided themselves on being alone in appreciating his genius; and\r\nthough, with the contempt of youth for the follies of middle-age, they\r\npatronised him among themselves, they did not fail to look upon it as a\r\nfeather in their caps if he had chosen a time when only one was there\r\nto be particularly wonderful. Cronshaw never came to Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s. For the\r\nlast four years he had lived in squalid conditions with a woman whom\r\nonly Lawson had once seen, in a tiny apartment on the sixth floor of\r\none of the most dilapidated houses on the Quai des Grands Augustins:\r\nLawson described with gusto the filth, the untidiness, the litter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the stink nearly blew your head off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at dinner, Lawson,\xe2\x80\x9d expostulated one of the others.\r\n\r\nBut he would not deny himself the pleasure of giving picturesque\r\ndetails of the odours which met his nostril. With a fierce delight in\r\nhis own realism he described the woman who had opened the door for him.\r\nShe was dark, small, and fat, quite young, with black hair that seemed\r\nalways on the point of coming down. She wore a slatternly blouse and no\r\ncorsets. With her red cheeks, large sensual mouth, and shining, lewd\r\neyes, she reminded you of the Bohemienne in the Louvre by Franz Hals.\r\nShe had a flaunting vulgarity which amused and yet horrified. A\r\nscrubby, unwashed baby was playing on the floor. It was known that the\r\nslut deceived Cronshaw with the most worthless ragamuffins of the\r\nQuarter, and it was a mystery to the ingenuous youths who absorbed his\r\nwisdom over a cafe table that Cronshaw with his keen intellect and his\r\npassion for beauty could ally himself to such a creature. But he seemed\r\nto revel in the coarseness of her language and would often report some\r\nphrase which reeked of the gutter. He referred to her ironically as la\r\nfille de mon concierge. Cronshaw was very poor. He earned a bare\r\nsubsistence by writing on the exhibitions of pictures for one or two\r\nEnglish papers, and he did a certain amount of translating. He had been\r\non the staff of an English paper in Paris, but had been dismissed for\r\ndrunkenness; he still however did odd jobs for it, describing sales at\r\nthe Hotel Drouot or the revues at music-halls. The life of Paris had\r\ngot into his bones, and he would not change it, notwithstanding its\r\nsqualor, drudgery, and hardship, for any other in the world. He\r\nremained there all through the year, even in summer when everyone he\r\nknew was away, and felt himself only at ease within a mile of the\r\nBoulevard St. Michel. But the curious thing was that he had never\r\nlearnt to speak French passably, and he kept in his shabby clothes\r\nbought at La Belle Jardiniere an ineradicably English appearance.\r\n\r\nHe was a man who would have made a success of life a century and a half\r\nago when conversation was a passport to good company and inebriety no\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have lived in the eighteen hundreds,\xe2\x80\x9d he said himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want is a patron. I should have published my poems by\r\nsubscription and dedicated them to a nobleman. I long to compose rhymed\r\ncouplets upon the poodle of a countess. My soul yearns for the love of\r\nchamber-maids and the conversation of bishops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe quoted the romantic Rolla,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe suis venu trop tard dans un monde trop vieux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe liked new faces, and he took a fancy to Philip, who seemed to\r\nachieve the difficult feat of talking just enough to suggest\r\nconversation and not too much to prevent monologue. Philip was\r\ncaptivated. He did not realise that little that Cronshaw said was new.\r\nHis personality in conversation had a curious power. He had a beautiful\r\nand a sonorous voice, and a manner of putting things which was\r\nirresistible to youth. All he said seemed to excite thought, and often\r\non the way home Lawson and Philip would walk to and from one another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhotels, discussing some point which a chance word of Cronshaw had\r\nsuggested. It was disconcerting to Philip, who had a youthful eagerness\r\nfor results, that Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s poetry hardly came up to expectation. It\r\nhad never been published in a volume, but most of it had appeared in\r\nperiodicals; and after a good deal of persuasion Cronshaw brought down\r\na bundle of pages torn out of The Yellow Book, The Saturday Review, and\r\nother journals, on each of which was a poem. Philip was taken aback to\r\nfind that most of them reminded him either of Henley or of Swinburne.\r\nIt needed the splendour of Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s delivery to make them personal.\r\nHe expressed his disappointment to Lawson, who carelessly repeated his\r\nwords; and next time Philip went to the Closerie des Lilas the poet\r\nturned to him with his sleek smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear you don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of my verses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI enjoyed reading them very\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not attempt to spare my feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cronshaw, with a wave\r\nof his fat hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not attach any exaggerated importance to my\r\npoetical works. Life is there to be lived rather than to be written\r\nabout. My aim is to search out the manifold experience that it offers,\r\nwringing from each moment what of emotion it presents. I look upon my\r\nwriting as a graceful accomplishment which does not absorb but rather\r\nadds pleasure to existence. And as for posterity\xe2\x80\x94damn posterity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled, for it leaped to one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes that the artist in life had\r\nproduced no more than a wretched daub. Cronshaw looked at him\r\nmeditatively and filled his glass. He sent the waiter for a packet of\r\ncigarettes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are amused because I talk in this fashion and you know that I am\r\npoor and live in an attic with a vulgar trollop who deceives me with\r\nhair-dressers and garcons de cafe; I translate wretched books for the\r\nBritish public, and write articles upon contemptible pictures which\r\ndeserve not even to be abused. But pray tell me what is the meaning of\r\nlife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, that\xe2\x80\x99s rather a difficult question. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you give the answer\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because it\xe2\x80\x99s worthless unless you yourself discover it. But what\r\ndo you suppose you are in the world for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had never asked himself, and he thought for a moment before\r\nreplying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know: I suppose to do one\xe2\x80\x99s duty, and make the best\r\npossible use of one\xe2\x80\x99s faculties, and avoid hurting other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, to do unto others as you would they should do unto you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristianity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has nothing to do with\r\nChristianity. It\xe2\x80\x99s just abstract morality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as abstract morality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, supposing under the influence of liquor you left your\r\npurse behind when you leave here and I picked it up, why do you imagine\r\nthat I should return it to you? It\xe2\x80\x99s not the fear of the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the dread of hell if you sin and the hope of Heaven if you are\r\nvirtuous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I believe in neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be. Neither did Kant when he devised the Categorical\r\nImperative. You have thrown aside a creed, but you have preserved the\r\nethic which was based upon it. To all intents you are a Christian\r\nstill, and if there is a God in Heaven you will undoubtedly receive\r\nyour reward. The Almighty can hardly be such a fool as the churches\r\nmake out. If you keep His laws I don\xe2\x80\x99t think He can care a packet of\r\npins whether you believe in Him or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I left my purse behind you would certainly return it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot from motives of abstract morality, but only from fear of the\r\npolice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand to one that the police would never find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ancestors have lived in a civilised state so long that the fear of\r\nthe police has eaten into my bones. The daughter of my concierge would\r\nnot hesitate for a moment. You answer that she belongs to the criminal\r\nclasses; not at all, she is merely devoid of vulgar prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then that does away with honour and virtue and goodness and\r\ndecency and everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever committed a sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak with the lips of a dissenting minister. I have never\r\ncommitted a sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCronshaw in his shabby great-coat, with the collar turned up, and his\r\nhat well down on his head, with his red fat face and his little\r\ngleaming eyes, looked extraordinarily comic; but Philip was too much in\r\nearnest to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never done anything you regret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I regret when what I did was inevitable?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cronshaw in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s fatalism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe illusion which man has that his will is free is so deeply rooted\r\nthat I am ready to accept it. I act as though I were a free agent. But\r\nwhen an action is performed it is clear that all the forces of the\r\nuniverse from all eternity conspired to cause it, and nothing I could\r\ndo could have prevented it. It was inevitable. If it was good I can\r\nclaim no merit; if it was bad I can accept no censure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brain reels,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some whiskey,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cronshaw, passing over the bottle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like it for clearing the head. You must expect to be\r\nthick-witted if you insist upon drinking beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip shook his head, and Cronshaw proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a bad fellow, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t drink. Sobriety disturbs\r\nconversation. But when I speak of good and bad\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Philip saw he was\r\ntaking up the thread of his discourse, \xe2\x80\x9cI speak conventionally. I\r\nattach no meaning to those words. I refuse to make a hierarchy of human\r\nactions and ascribe worthiness to some and ill-repute to others. The\r\nterms vice and virtue have no signification for me. I do not confer\r\npraise or blame: I accept. I am the measure of all things. I am the\r\ncentre of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are one or two other people in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak only for myself. I know them only as they limit my activities.\r\nRound each of them too the world turns, and each one for himself is the\r\ncentre of the universe. My right over them extends only as far as my\r\npower. What I can do is the only limit of what I may do. Because we are\r\ngregarious we live in society, and society holds together by means of\r\nforce, force of arms (that is the policeman) and force of public\r\nopinion (that is Mrs. Grundy). You have society on one hand and the\r\nindividual on the other: each is an organism striving for\r\nself-preservation. It is might against might. I stand alone, bound to\r\naccept society and not unwilling, since in return for the taxes I pay\r\nit protects me, a weakling, against the tyranny of another stronger\r\nthan I am; but I submit to its laws because I must; I do not\r\nacknowledge their justice: I do not know justice, I only know power.\r\nAnd when I have paid for the policeman who protects me and, if I live\r\nin a country where conscription is in force, served in the army which\r\nguards my house and land from the invader, I am quits with society: for\r\nthe rest I counter its might with my wiliness. It makes laws for its\r\nself-preservation, and if I break them it imprisons or kills me: it has\r\nthe might to do so and therefore the right. If I break the laws I will\r\naccept the vengeance of the state, but I will not regard it as\r\npunishment nor shall I feel myself convicted of wrong-doing. Society\r\ntempts me to its service by honours and riches and the good opinion of\r\nmy fellows; but I am indifferent to their good opinion, I despise\r\nhonours and I can do very well without riches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if everyone thought like you things would go to pieces at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to do with others, I am only concerned with myself. I\r\ntake advantage of the fact that the majority of mankind are led by\r\ncertain rewards to do things which directly or indirectly tend to my\r\nconvenience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me an awfully selfish way of looking at things,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you under the impression that men ever do anything except for\r\nselfish reasons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible that they should. You will find as you grow older\r\nthat the first thing needful to make the world a tolerable place to\r\nlive in is to recognise the inevitable selfishness of humanity. You\r\ndemand unselfishness from others, which is a preposterous claim that\r\nthey should sacrifice their desires to yours. Why should they? When you\r\nare reconciled to the fact that each is for himself in the world you\r\nwill ask less from your fellows. They will not disappoint you, and you\r\nwill look upon them more charitably. Men seek but one thing in\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94their pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip.\r\n\r\nCronshaw chuckled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rear like a frightened colt, because I use a word to which your\r\nChristianity ascribes a deprecatory meaning. You have a hierarchy of\r\nvalues; pleasure is at the bottom of the ladder, and you speak with a\r\nlittle thrill of self-satisfaction, of duty, charity, and truthfulness.\r\nYou think pleasure is only of the senses; the wretched slaves who\r\nmanufactured your morality despised a satisfaction which they had small\r\nmeans of enjoying. You would not be so frightened if I had spoken of\r\nhappiness instead of pleasure: it sounds less shocking, and your mind\r\nwanders from the sty of Epicurus to his garden. But I will speak of\r\npleasure, for I see that men aim at that, and I do not know that they\r\naim at happiness. It is pleasure that lurks in the practice of every\r\none of your virtues. Man performs actions because they are good for\r\nhim, and when they are good for other people as well they are thought\r\nvirtuous: if he finds pleasure in giving alms he is charitable; if he\r\nfinds pleasure in helping others he is benevolent; if he finds pleasure\r\nin working for society he is public-spirited; but it is for your\r\nprivate pleasure that you give twopence to a beggar as much as it is\r\nfor my private pleasure that I drink another whiskey and soda. I, less\r\nof a humbug than you, neither applaud myself for my pleasure nor demand\r\nyour admiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut have you never known people do things they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to instead\r\nof things they did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You put your question foolishly. What you mean is that people\r\naccept an immediate pain rather than an immediate pleasure. The\r\nobjection is as foolish as your manner of putting it. It is clear that\r\nmen accept an immediate pain rather than an immediate pleasure, but\r\nonly because they expect a greater pleasure in the future. Often the\r\npleasure is illusory, but their error in calculation is no refutation\r\nof the rule. You are puzzled because you cannot get over the idea that\r\npleasures are only of the senses; but, child, a man who dies for his\r\ncountry dies because he likes it as surely as a man eats pickled\r\ncabbage because he likes it. It is a law of creation. If it were\r\npossible for men to prefer pain to pleasure the human race would have\r\nlong since become extinct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if all that is true,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the use of anything?\r\nIf you take away duty and goodness and beauty why are we brought into\r\nthe world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes the gorgeous East to suggest an answer,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Cronshaw.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to two persons who at that moment opened the door of the\r\ncafe, and, with a blast of cold air, entered. They were Levantines,\r\nitinerant vendors of cheap rugs, and each bore on his arm a bundle. It\r\nwas Sunday evening, and the cafe was very full. They passed among the\r\ntables, and in that atmosphere heavy and discoloured with tobacco\r\nsmoke, rank with humanity, they seemed to bring an air of mystery. They\r\nwere clad in European, shabby clothes, their thin great-coats were\r\nthreadbare, but each wore a tarbouch. Their faces were gray with cold.\r\nOne was of middle age, with a black beard, but the other was a youth of\r\neighteen, with a face deeply scarred by smallpox and with one eye only.\r\nThey passed by Cronshaw and Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah is great, and Mahomet is his prophet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronshaw\r\nimpressively.\r\n\r\nThe elder advanced with a cringing smile, like a mongrel used to blows.\r\nWith a sidelong glance at the door and a quick surreptitious movement\r\nhe showed a pornographic picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you Masr-ed-Deen, the merchant of Alexandria, or is it from far\r\nBagdad that you bring your goods, O, my uncle; and yonder one-eyed\r\nyouth, do I see in him one of the three kings of whom Scheherazade told\r\nstories to her lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s smile grew more ingratiating, though he understood no word\r\nof what Cronshaw said, and like a conjurer he produced a sandalwood\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, show us the priceless web of Eastern looms,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Cronshaw. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nI would point a moral and adorn a tale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Levantine unfolded a table-cloth, red and yellow, vulgar, hideous,\r\nand grotesque.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-five francs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, my uncle, this cloth knew not the weavers of Samarkand, and those\r\ncolours were never made in the vats of Bokhara.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five francs,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled the pedlar obsequiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUltima Thule was the place of its manufacture, even Birmingham the\r\nplace of my birth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen francs,\xe2\x80\x9d cringed the bearded man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet thee gone, fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronshaw. \xe2\x80\x9cMay wild asses defile the\r\ngrave of thy maternal grandmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImperturbably, but smiling no more, the Levantine passed with his wares\r\nto another table. Cronshaw turned to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever been to the Cluny, the museum? There you will see\r\nPersian carpets of the most exquisite hue and of a pattern the\r\nbeautiful intricacy of which delights and amazes the eye. In them you\r\nwill see the mystery and the sensual beauty of the East, the roses of\r\nHafiz and the wine-cup of Omar; but presently you will see more. You\r\nwere asking just now what was the meaning of life. Go and look at those\r\nPersian carpets, and one of these days the answer will come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are cryptic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cronshaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip did not find living in Paris as cheap as he had been led to\r\nbelieve and by February had spent most of the money with which he\r\nstarted. He was too proud to appeal to his guardian, nor did he wish\r\nAunt Louisa to know that his circumstances were straitened, since he\r\nwas certain she would make an effort to send him something from her own\r\npocket, and he knew how little she could afford to. In three months he\r\nwould attain his majority and come into possession of his small\r\nfortune. He tided over the interval by selling the few trinkets which\r\nhe had inherited from his father.\r\n\r\nAt about this time Lawson suggested that they should take a small\r\nstudio which was vacant in one of the streets that led out of the\r\nBoulevard Raspail. It was very cheap. It had a room attached, which\r\nthey could use as a bed-room; and since Philip was at the school every\r\nmorning Lawson could have the undisturbed use of the studio then;\r\nLawson, after wandering from school to school, had come to the\r\nconclusion that he could work best alone, and proposed to get a model\r\nin three or four days a week. At first Philip hesitated on account of\r\nthe expense, but they reckoned it out; and it seemed (they were so\r\nanxious to have a studio of their own that they calculated\r\npragmatically) that the cost would not be much greater than that of\r\nliving in a hotel. Though the rent and the cleaning by the concierge\r\nwould come to a little more, they would save on the petit dejeuner,\r\nwhich they could make themselves. A year or two earlier Philip would\r\nhave refused to share a room with anyone, since he was so sensitive\r\nabout his deformed foot, but his morbid way of looking at it was\r\ngrowing less marked: in Paris it did not seem to matter so much, and,\r\nthough he never by any chance forgot it himself, he ceased to feel that\r\nother people were constantly noticing it.\r\n\r\nThey moved in, bought a couple of beds, a washing-stand, a few chairs,\r\nand felt for the first time the thrill of possession. They were so\r\nexcited that the first night they went to bed in what they could call a\r\nhome they lay awake talking till three in the morning; and next day\r\nfound lighting the fire and making their own coffee, which they had in\r\npyjamas, such a jolly business that Philip did not get to Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntill nearly eleven. He was in excellent spirits. He nodded to Fanny\r\nPrice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked cheerily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in reply.\r\n\r\nPhilip could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t jump down my throat. I was only trying to make myself polite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want your politeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth while quarrelling with me too?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip\r\nmildly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are so few people you\xe2\x80\x99re on speaking terms with, as it\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my business, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to work, vaguely wondering why Fanny Price made herself so\r\ndisagreeable. He had come to the conclusion that he thoroughly disliked\r\nher. Everyone did. People were only civil to her at all from fear of\r\nthe malice of her tongue; for to their faces and behind their backs she\r\nsaid abominable things. But Philip was feeling so happy that he did not\r\nwant even Miss Price to bear ill-feeling towards him. He used the\r\nartifice which had often before succeeded in banishing her ill-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come and look at my drawing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in an awful\r\nmess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got something better to do with my\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip stared at her in surprise, for the one thing she could be\r\ncounted upon to do with alacrity was to give advice. She went on\r\nquickly in a low voice, savage with fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s gone you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll put up with me. Thank you very\r\nmuch. Go and find somebody else to help you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s leavings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson had the pedagogic instinct; whenever he found anything out he\r\nwas eager to impart it; and because he taught with delight he talked\r\nwith profit. Philip, without thinking anything about it, had got into\r\nthe habit of sitting by his side; it never occurred to him that Fanny\r\nPrice was consumed with jealousy, and watched his acceptance of someone\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s tuition with ever-increasing anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were very glad to put up with me when you knew nobody here,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cand as soon as you made friends with other people you\r\nthrew me aside, like an old glove\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she repeated the stale metaphor with\r\nsatisfaction\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clike an old glove. All right, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ngoing to be made a fool of another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a suspicion of truth in what she said, and it made Philip\r\nangry enough to answer what first came into his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it all, I only asked your advice because I saw it pleased you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a gasp and threw him a sudden look of anguish. Then two tears\r\nrolled down her cheeks. She looked frowsy and grotesque. Philip, not\r\nknowing what on earth this new attitude implied, went back to his work.\r\nHe was uneasy and conscience-stricken; but he would not go to her and\r\nsay he was sorry if he had caused her pain, because he was afraid she\r\nwould take the opportunity to snub him. For two or three weeks she did\r\nnot speak to him, and, after Philip had got over the discomfort of\r\nbeing cut by her, he was somewhat relieved to be free from so difficult\r\na friendship. He had been a little disconcerted by the air of\r\nproprietorship she assumed over him. She was an extraordinary woman.\r\nShe came every day to the studio at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and was ready to\r\nstart working when the model was in position; she worked steadily,\r\ntalking to no one, struggling hour after hour with difficulties she\r\ncould not overcome, and remained till the clock struck twelve. Her work\r\nwas hopeless. There was not in it the smallest approach even to the\r\nmediocre achievement at which most of the young persons were able after\r\nsome months to arrive. She wore every day the same ugly brown dress,\r\nwith the mud of the last wet day still caked on the hem and with the\r\nraggedness, which Philip had noticed the first time he saw her, still\r\nunmended.\r\n\r\nBut one day she came up to him, and with a scarlet face asked whether\r\nshe might speak to him afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, as much as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait behind at\r\ntwelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to her when the day\xe2\x80\x99s work was over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you walk a little bit with me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking away from him\r\nwith embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked for two or three minutes in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember what you said to me the other day?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked then on a\r\nsudden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a quick, painful inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to quarrel with you. You\xe2\x80\x99re the only friend I had in\r\nParis. I thought you rather liked me. I felt there was something\r\nbetween us. I was drawn towards you\xe2\x80\x94you know what I mean, your\r\nclub-foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened and instinctively tried to walk without a limp. He did\r\nnot like anyone to mention the deformity. He knew what Fanny Price\r\nmeant. She was ugly and uncouth, and because he was deformed there was\r\nbetween them a certain sympathy. He was very angry with her, but he\r\nforced himself not to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you only asked my advice to please me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think my\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x99s any good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen your drawing at Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s. It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully hard to judge\r\nfrom that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99d come and look at my other work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nasked anyone else to look at it. I should like to show it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully kind of you. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live quite near here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said apologetically. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll only take you\r\nten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThey were walking along the boulevard, and she turned down a side\r\nstreet, then led him into another, poorer still, with cheap shops on\r\nthe ground floor, and at last stopped. They climbed flight after flight\r\nof stairs. She unlocked a door, and they went into a tiny attic with a\r\nsloping roof and a small window. This was closed and the room had a\r\nmusty smell. Though it was very cold there was no fire and no sign that\r\nthere had been one. The bed was unmade. A chair, a chest of drawers\r\nwhich served also as a wash-stand, and a cheap easel, were all the\r\nfurniture. The place would have been squalid enough in any case, but\r\nthe litter, the untidiness, made the impression revolting. On the\r\nchimney-piece, scattered over with paints and brushes, were a cup, a\r\ndirty plate, and a tea-pot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll stand over there I\xe2\x80\x99ll put them on the chair so that you can\r\nsee them better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed him twenty small canvases, about eighteen by twelve. She\r\nplaced them on the chair, one after the other, watching his face; he\r\nnodded as he looked at each one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do like them, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said anxiously, after a bit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just want to look at them all first,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk\r\nafterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was collecting himself. He was panic-stricken. He did not know what\r\nto say. It was not only that they were ill-drawn, or that the colour\r\nwas put on amateurishly by someone who had no eye for it; but there was\r\nno attempt at getting the values, and the perspective was grotesque. It\r\nlooked like the work of a child of five, but a child would have had\r\nsome naivete and might at least have made an attempt to put down what\r\nhe saw; but here was the work of a vulgar mind chock full of\r\nrecollections of vulgar pictures. Philip remembered that she had talked\r\nenthusiastically about Monet and the Impressionists, but here were only\r\nthe worst traditions of the Royal Academy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was no more truthful than anybody else, but he had a great\r\ndifficulty in telling a thundering, deliberate lie, and he blushed\r\nfuriously when he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think they\xe2\x80\x99re most awfully good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint colour came into her unhealthy cheeks, and she smiled a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t say so if you don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, you know. I want the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you got any criticism to offer? There must be some you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike as well as others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked round helplessly. He saw a landscape, the typical\r\npicturesque \xe2\x80\x98bit\xe2\x80\x99 of the amateur, an old bridge, a creeper-clad\r\ncottage, and a leafy bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite sure about the values of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flushed darkly and taking up the picture quickly turned its back to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you should have chosen that one to sneer at. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure my values are all right. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nthing you can\xe2\x80\x99t teach anyone, you either understand values or you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think they\xe2\x80\x99re all most awfully good,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Philip.\r\n\r\nShe looked at them with an air of self-satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re anything to be ashamed of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting late. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you let me give you a little lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my lunch waiting for me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip saw no sign of it, but supposed perhaps the concierge would\r\nbring it up when he was gone. He was in a hurry to get away. The\r\nmustiness of the room made his head ache.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March there was all the excitement of sending in to the Salon.\r\nClutton, characteristically, had nothing ready, and he was very\r\nscornful of the two heads that Lawson sent; they were obviously the\r\nwork of a student, straight-forward portraits of models, but they had a\r\ncertain force; Clutton, aiming at perfection, had no patience with\r\nefforts which betrayed hesitancy, and with a shrug of the shoulders\r\ntold Lawson it was an impertinence to exhibit stuff which should never\r\nhave been allowed out of his studio; he was not less contemptuous when\r\nthe two heads were accepted. Flanagan tried his luck too, but his\r\npicture was refused. Mrs. Otter sent a blameless Portrait de ma Mere,\r\naccomplished and second-rate; and was hung in a very good place.\r\n\r\nHayward, whom Philip had not seen since he left Heidelberg, arrived in\r\nParis to spend a few days in time to come to the party which Lawson and\r\nPhilip were giving in their studio to celebrate the hanging of Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npictures. Philip had been eager to see Hayward again, but when at last\r\nthey met, he experienced some disappointment. Hayward had altered a\r\nlittle in appearance: his fine hair was thinner, and with the rapid\r\nwilting of the very fair, he was becoming wizened and colourless; his\r\nblue eyes were paler than they had been, and there was a muzziness\r\nabout his features. On the other hand, in mind he did not seem to have\r\nchanged at all, and the culture which had impressed Philip at eighteen\r\naroused somewhat the contempt of Philip at twenty-one. He had altered a\r\ngood deal himself, and regarding with scorn all his old opinions of\r\nart, life, and letters, had no patience with anyone who still held\r\nthem. He was scarcely conscious of the fact that he wanted to show off\r\nbefore Hayward, but when he took him round the galleries he poured out\r\nto him all the revolutionary opinions which himself had so recently\r\nadopted. He took him to Manet\xe2\x80\x99s Olympia and said dramatically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would give all the old masters except Velasquez, Rembrandt, and\r\nVermeer for that one picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was Vermeer?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear fellow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know Vermeer? You\xe2\x80\x99re not civilised. You\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t live a moment longer without making his acquaintance. He\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\none old master who painted like a modern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dragged Hayward out of the Luxembourg and hurried him off to the\r\nLouvre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut aren\xe2\x80\x99t there any more pictures here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hayward, with the\r\ntourist\xe2\x80\x99s passion for thoroughness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the least consequence. You can come and look at them by\r\nyourself with your Baedeker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the Louvre Philip led his friend down the Long\r\nGallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see The Gioconda,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s only literature,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a small room, Philip stopped before The Lacemaker of\r\nVermeer van Delft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best picture in the Louvre. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly like a\r\nManet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith an expressive, eloquent thumb Philip expatiated on the charming\r\nwork. He used the jargon of the studios with overpowering effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I see anything so wonderful as all that in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s a painter\xe2\x80\x99s picture,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI can quite believe\r\nthe layman would see nothing much in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe layman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike most people who cultivate an interest in the arts, Hayward was\r\nextremely anxious to be right. He was dogmatic with those who did not\r\nventure to assert themselves, but with the self-assertive he was very\r\nmodest. He was impressed by Philip\xe2\x80\x99s assurance, and accepted meekly\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s implied suggestion that the painter\xe2\x80\x99s arrogant claim to be the\r\nsole possible judge of painting has anything but its impertinence to\r\nrecommend it.\r\n\r\nA day or two later Philip and Lawson gave their party. Cronshaw, making\r\nan exception in their favour, agreed to eat their food; and Miss\r\nChalice offered to come and cook for them. She took no interest in her\r\nown sex and declined the suggestion that other girls should be asked\r\nfor her sake. Clutton, Flanagan, Potter, and two others made up the\r\nparty. Furniture was scarce, so the model stand was used as a table,\r\nand the guests were to sit on portmanteaux if they liked, and if they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t on the floor. The feast consisted of a pot-au-feu, which Miss\r\nChalice had made, of a leg of mutton roasted round the corner and\r\nbrought round hot and savoury (Miss Chalice had cooked the potatoes,\r\nand the studio was redolent of the carrots she had fried; fried carrots\r\nwere her specialty); and this was to be followed by poires flambees,\r\npears with burning brandy, which Cronshaw had volunteered to make. The\r\nmeal was to finish with an enormous fromage de Brie, which stood near\r\nthe window and added fragrant odours to all the others which filled the\r\nstudio. Cronshaw sat in the place of honour on a Gladstone bag, with\r\nhis legs curled under him like a Turkish bashaw, beaming good-naturedly\r\non the young people who surrounded him. From force of habit, though the\r\nsmall studio with the stove lit was very hot, he kept on his\r\ngreat-coat, with the collar turned up, and his bowler hat: he looked\r\nwith satisfaction on the four large fiaschi of Chianti which stood in\r\nfront of him in a row, two on each side of a bottle of whiskey; he said\r\nit reminded him of a slim fair Circassian guarded by four corpulent\r\neunuchs. Hayward in order to put the rest of them at their ease had\r\nclothed himself in a tweed suit and a Trinity Hall tie. He looked\r\ngrotesquely British. The others were elaborately polite to him, and\r\nduring the soup they talked of the weather and the political situation.\r\nThere was a pause while they waited for the leg of mutton, and Miss\r\nChalice lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair,\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly.\r\n\r\nWith an elegant gesture she untied a ribbon so that her tresses fell\r\nover her shoulders. She shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always feel more comfortable with my hair down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith her large brown eyes, thin, ascetic face, her pale skin, and broad\r\nforehead, she might have stepped out of a picture by Burne-Jones. She\r\nhad long, beautiful hands, with fingers deeply stained by nicotine. She\r\nwore sweeping draperies, mauve and green. There was about her the\r\nromantic air of High Street, Kensington. She was wantonly aesthetic;\r\nbut she was an excellent creature, kind and good natured; and her\r\naffectations were but skin-deep. There was a knock at the door, and\r\nthey all gave a shout of exultation. Miss Chalice rose and opened. She\r\ntook the leg of mutton and held it high above her, as though it were\r\nthe head of John the Baptist on a platter; and, the cigarette still in\r\nher mouth, advanced with solemn, hieratic steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHail, daughter of Herodias,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cronshaw.\r\n\r\nThe mutton was eaten with gusto, and it did one good to see what a\r\nhearty appetite the pale-faced lady had. Clutton and Potter sat on each\r\nside of her, and everyone knew that neither had found her unduly coy.\r\nShe grew tired of most people in six weeks, but she knew exactly how to\r\ntreat afterwards the gentlemen who had laid their young hearts at her\r\nfeet. She bore them no ill-will, though having loved them she had\r\nceased to do so, and treated them with friendliness but without\r\nfamiliarity. Now and then she looked at Lawson with melancholy eyes.\r\nThe poires flambees were a great success, partly because of the brandy,\r\nand partly because Miss Chalice insisted that they should be eaten with\r\nthe cheese.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly delicious, or whether I\xe2\x80\x99m just\r\ngoing to vomit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after she had thoroughly tried the mixture.\r\n\r\nCoffee and cognac followed with sufficient speed to prevent any\r\nuntoward consequence, and they settled down to smoke in comfort. Ruth\r\nChalice, who could do nothing that was not deliberately artistic,\r\narranged herself in a graceful attitude by Cronshaw and just rested her\r\nexquisite head on his shoulder. She looked into the dark abyss of time\r\nwith brooding eyes, and now and then with a long meditative glance at\r\nLawson she sighed deeply.\r\n\r\nThen came the summer, and restlessness seized these young people. The\r\nblue skies lured them to the sea, and the pleasant breeze sighing\r\nthrough the leaves of the plane-trees on the boulevard drew them\r\ntowards the country. Everyone made plans for leaving Paris; they\r\ndiscussed what was the most suitable size for the canvases they meant\r\nto take; they laid in stores of panels for sketching; they argued about\r\nthe merits of various places in Brittany. Flanagan and Potter went to\r\nConcarneau; Mrs. Otter and her mother, with a natural instinct for the\r\nobvious, went to Pont-Aven; Philip and Lawson made up their minds to go\r\nto the forest of Fontainebleau, and Miss Chalice knew of a very good\r\nhotel at Moret where there was lots of stuff to paint; it was near\r\nParis, and neither Philip nor Lawson was indifferent to the railway\r\nfare. Ruth Chalice would be there, and Lawson had an idea for a\r\nportrait of her in the open air. Just then the Salon was full of\r\nportraits of people in gardens, in sunlight, with blinking eyes and\r\ngreen reflections of sunlit leaves on their faces. They asked Clutton\r\nto go with them, but he preferred spending the summer by himself. He\r\nhad just discovered Cezanne, and was eager to go to Provence; he wanted\r\nheavy skies from which the hot blue seemed to drip like beads of sweat,\r\nand broad white dusty roads, and pale roofs out of which the sun had\r\nburnt the colour, and olive trees gray with heat.\r\n\r\nThe day before they were to start, after the morning class, Philip,\r\nputting his things together, spoke to Fanny Price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff where?\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going away?\xe2\x80\x9d Her face fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going away for the summer. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m staying in Paris. I thought you were going to stay too. I was\r\nlooking forward\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped and shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t it be frightfully hot here? It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully bad for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch you care if it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for me. Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChalice is going there. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLawson and I are going. And she\xe2\x80\x99s going there too. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re actually going together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a low guttural sound, and her large face grew dark and red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow filthy! I thought you were a decent fellow. You were about the\r\nonly one here. She\xe2\x80\x99s been with Clutton and Potter and Flanagan, even\r\nwith old Foinet\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why he takes so much trouble about her\xe2\x80\x94and now\r\ntwo of you, you and Lawson. It makes me sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense! She\xe2\x80\x99s a very decent sort. One treats her just as if\r\nshe were a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can it matter to you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really no business\r\nof yours where I spend my summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking forward to it so much,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, speaking it seemed\r\nalmost to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you had the money to go away, and\r\nthere wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been anyone else here, and we could have worked\r\ntogether, and we\xe2\x80\x99d have gone to see things.\xe2\x80\x9d Then her thoughts flung\r\nback to Ruth Chalice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe filthy beast,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t fit to\r\nspeak to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at her with a sinking heart. He was not a man to think\r\ngirls were in love with him; he was too conscious of his deformity, and\r\nhe felt awkward and clumsy with women; but he did not know what else\r\nthis outburst could mean. Fanny Price, in the dirty brown dress, with\r\nher hair falling over her face, sloppy, untidy, stood before him; and\r\ntears of anger rolled down her cheeks. She was repellent. Philip\r\nglanced at the door, instinctively hoping that someone would come in\r\nand put an end to the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just the same as all of them. You take all you can get, and you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t even say thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve taught you everything you know. No one\r\nelse would take any trouble with you. Has Foinet ever bothered about\r\nyou? And I can tell you this\xe2\x80\x94you can work here for a thousand years and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll never do any good. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any talent. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nany originality. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not only me\xe2\x80\x94they all say it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never be\r\na painter as long as you live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no business of yours either, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, flushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you think it\xe2\x80\x99s only my temper. Ask Clutton, ask Lawson, ask\r\nChalice. Never, never, never. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip shrugged his shoulders and walked out. She shouted after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never, never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMoret was in those days an old-fashioned town of one street at the edge\r\nof the forest of Fontainebleau, and the Ecu d\xe2\x80\x99Or was a hotel which\r\nstill had about it the decrepit air of the Ancien Regime. It faced the\r\nwinding river, the Loing; and Miss Chalice had a room with a little\r\nterrace overlooking it, with a charming view of the old bridge and its\r\nfortified gateway. They sat here in the evenings after dinner, drinking\r\ncoffee, smoking, and discussing art. There ran into the river, a little\r\nway off, a narrow canal bordered by poplars, and along the banks of\r\nthis after their day\xe2\x80\x99s work they often wandered. They spent all day\r\npainting. Like most of their generation they were obsessed by the fear\r\nof the picturesque, and they turned their backs on the obvious beauty\r\nof the town to seek subjects which were devoid of a prettiness they\r\ndespised. Sisley and Monet had painted the canal with its poplars, and\r\nthey felt a desire to try their hands at what was so typical of France;\r\nbut they were frightened of its formal beauty, and set themselves\r\ndeliberately to avoid it. Miss Chalice, who had a clever dexterity\r\nwhich impressed Lawson notwithstanding his contempt for feminine art,\r\nstarted a picture in which she tried to circumvent the commonplace by\r\nleaving out the tops of the trees; and Lawson had the brilliant idea of\r\nputting in his foreground a large blue advertisement of chocolat Menier\r\nin order to emphasise his abhorrence of the chocolate box.\r\n\r\nPhilip began now to paint in oils. He experienced a thrill of delight\r\nwhen first he used that grateful medium. He went out with Lawson in the\r\nmorning with his little box and sat by him painting a panel; it gave\r\nhim so much satisfaction that he did not realise he was doing no more\r\nthan copy; he was so much under his friend\xe2\x80\x99s influence that he saw only\r\nwith his eyes. Lawson painted very low in tone, and they both saw the\r\nemerald of the grass like dark velvet, while the brilliance of the sky\r\nturned in their hands to a brooding ultramarine. Through July they had\r\none fine day after another; it was very hot; and the heat, searing\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart, filled him with languor; he could not work; his mind\r\nwas eager with a thousand thoughts. Often he spent the mornings by the\r\nside of the canal in the shade of the poplars, reading a few lines and\r\nthen dreaming for half an hour. Sometimes he hired a rickety bicycle\r\nand rode along the dusty road that led to the forest, and then lay down\r\nin a clearing. His head was full of romantic fancies. The ladies of\r\nWatteau, gay and insouciant, seemed to wander with their cavaliers\r\namong the great trees, whispering to one another careless, charming\r\nthings, and yet somehow oppressed by a nameless fear.\r\n\r\nThey were alone in the hotel but for a fat Frenchwoman of middle age, a\r\nRabelaisian figure with a broad, obscene laugh. She spent the day by\r\nthe river patiently fishing for fish she never caught, and Philip\r\nsometimes went down and talked to her. He found out that she had\r\nbelonged to a profession whose most notorious member for our generation\r\nwas Mrs. Warren, and having made a competence she now lived the quiet\r\nlife of the bourgeoise. She told Philip lewd stories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go to Seville,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94she spoke a little broken English.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe most beautiful women in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leered and nodded her head. Her triple chin, her large belly, shook\r\nwith inward laughter.\r\n\r\nIt grew so hot that it was almost impossible to sleep at night. The\r\nheat seemed to linger under the trees as though it were a material\r\nthing. They did not wish to leave the starlit night, and the three of\r\nthem would sit on the terrace of Ruth Chalice\xe2\x80\x99s room, silent, hour\r\nafter hour, too tired to talk any more, but in voluptuous enjoyment of\r\nthe stillness. They listened to the murmur of the river. The church\r\nclock struck one and two and sometimes three before they could drag\r\nthemselves to bed. Suddenly Philip became aware that Ruth Chalice and\r\nLawson were lovers. He divined it in the way the girl looked at the\r\nyoung painter, and in his air of possession; and as Philip sat with\r\nthem he felt a kind of effluence surrounding them, as though the air\r\nwere heavy with something strange. The revelation was a shock. He had\r\nlooked upon Miss Chalice as a very good fellow and he liked to talk to\r\nher, but it had never seemed to him possible to enter into a closer\r\nrelationship. One Sunday they had all gone with a tea-basket into the\r\nforest, and when they came to a glade which was suitably sylvan, Miss\r\nChalice, because it was idyllic, insisted on taking off her shoes and\r\nstockings. It would have been very charming only her feet were rather\r\nlarge and she had on both a large corn on the third toe. Philip felt it\r\nmade her proceeding a little ridiculous. But now he looked upon her\r\nquite differently; there was something softly feminine in her large\r\neyes and her olive skin; he felt himself a fool not to have seen that\r\nshe was attractive. He thought he detected in her a touch of contempt\r\nfor him, because he had not had the sense to see that she was there, in\r\nhis way, and in Lawson a suspicion of superiority. He was envious of\r\nLawson, and he was jealous, not of the individual concerned, but of his\r\nlove. He wished that he was standing in his shoes and feeling with his\r\nheart. He was troubled, and the fear seized him that love would pass\r\nhim by. He wanted a passion to seize him, he wanted to be swept off his\r\nfeet and borne powerless in a mighty rush he cared not whither. Miss\r\nChalice and Lawson seemed to him now somehow different, and the\r\nconstant companionship with them made him restless. He was dissatisfied\r\nwith himself. Life was not giving him what he wanted, and he had an\r\nuneasy feeling that he was losing his time.\r\n\r\nThe stout Frenchwoman soon guessed what the relations were between the\r\ncouple, and talked of the matter to Philip with the utmost frankness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with the tolerant smile of one who had fattened on\r\nthe lust of her fellows, \xe2\x80\x9chave you got a petite amie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not? C\xe2\x80\x99est de votre age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. He had a volume of Verlaine in his hands,\r\nand he wandered off. He tried to read, but his passion was too strong.\r\nHe thought of the stray amours to which he had been introduced by\r\nFlanagan, the sly visits to houses in a cul-de-sac, with the\r\ndrawing-room in Utrecht velvet, and the mercenary graces of painted\r\nwomen. He shuddered. He threw himself on the grass, stretching his\r\nlimbs like a young animal freshly awaked from sleep; and the rippling\r\nwater, the poplars gently tremulous in the faint breeze, the blue sky,\r\nwere almost more than he could bear. He was in love with love. In his\r\nfancy he felt the kiss of warm lips on his, and around his neck the\r\ntouch of soft hands. He imagined himself in the arms of Ruth Chalice,\r\nhe thought of her dark eyes and the wonderful texture of her skin; he\r\nwas mad to have let such a wonderful adventure slip through his\r\nfingers. And if Lawson had done it why should not he? But this was only\r\nwhen he did not see her, when he lay awake at night or dreamed idly by\r\nthe side of the canal; when he saw her he felt suddenly quite\r\ndifferent; he had no desire to take her in his arms, and he could not\r\nimagine himself kissing her. It was very curious. Away from her he\r\nthought her beautiful, remembering only her magnificent eyes and the\r\ncreamy pallor of her face; but when he was with her he saw only that\r\nshe was flat-chested and that her teeth were slightly decayed; he could\r\nnot forget the corns on her toes. He could not understand himself.\r\nWould he always love only in absence and be prevented from enjoying\r\nanything when he had the chance by that deformity of vision which\r\nseemed to exaggerate the revolting?\r\n\r\nHe was not sorry when a change in the weather, announcing the definite\r\nend of the long summer, drove them all back to Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Philip returned to Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s he found that Fanny Price was no\r\nlonger working there. She had given up the key of her locker. He asked\r\nMrs. Otter whether she knew what had become of her; and Mrs. Otter,\r\nwith a shrug of the shoulders, answered that she had probably gone back\r\nto England. Philip was relieved. He was profoundly bored by her\r\nill-temper. Moreover she insisted on advising him about his work,\r\nlooked upon it as a slight when he did not follow her precepts, and\r\nwould not understand that he felt himself no longer the duffer he had\r\nbeen at first. Soon he forgot all about her. He was working in oils now\r\nand he was full of enthusiasm. He hoped to have something done of\r\nsufficient importance to send to the following year\xe2\x80\x99s Salon. Lawson was\r\npainting a portrait of Miss Chalice. She was very paintable, and all\r\nthe young men who had fallen victims to her charm had made portraits of\r\nher. A natural indolence, joined with a passion for picturesque\r\nattitude, made her an excellent sitter; and she had enough technical\r\nknowledge to offer useful criticisms. Since her passion for art was\r\nchiefly a passion to live the life of artists, she was quite content to\r\nneglect her own work. She liked the warmth of the studio, and the\r\nopportunity to smoke innumerable cigarettes; and she spoke in a low,\r\npleasant voice of the love of art and the art of love. She made no\r\nclear distinction between the two.\r\n\r\nLawson was painting with infinite labour, working till he could hardly\r\nstand for days and then scraping out all he had done. He would have\r\nexhausted the patience of anyone but Ruth Chalice. At last he got into\r\na hopeless muddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is to take a new canvas and start fresh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow exactly what I want now, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t take me long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was present at the time, and Miss Chalice said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you paint me too? You\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to learn a lot by watching\r\nMr. Lawson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was one of Miss Chalice\xe2\x80\x99s delicacies that she always addressed her\r\nlovers by their surnames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like it awfully if Lawson wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Philip set about a portrait, and he began\r\nwith trepidation but also with pride. He sat by Lawson and painted as\r\nhe saw him paint. He profited by the example and by the advice which\r\nboth Lawson and Miss Chalice freely gave him. At last Lawson finished\r\nand invited Clutton in to criticise. Clutton had only just come back to\r\nParis. From Provence he had drifted down to Spain, eager to see\r\nVelasquez at Madrid, and thence he had gone to Toledo. He stayed there\r\nthree months, and he was returned with a name new to the young men: he\r\nhad wonderful things to say of a painter called El Greco, who it\r\nappeared could only be studied in Toledo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I know about him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s the old master whose\r\ndistinction it is that he painted as badly as the moderns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClutton, more taciturn than ever, did not answer, but he looked at\r\nLawson with a sardonic air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to show us the stuff you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought back from Spain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t paint in Spain, I was too busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought things out. I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m through with the Impressionists;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got an idea they\xe2\x80\x99ll seem very thin and superficial in a few years.\r\nI want to make a clean sweep of everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt and start fresh.\r\nWhen I came back I destroyed everything I\xe2\x80\x99d painted. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing\r\nin my studio now but an easel, my paints, and some clean canvases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only got an inkling of what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke slowly, in a curious manner, as though he were straining to\r\nhear something which was only just audible. There seemed to be a\r\nmysterious force in him which he himself did not understand, but which\r\nwas struggling obscurely to find an outlet. His strength impressed you.\r\nLawson dreaded the criticism he asked for and had discounted the blame\r\nhe thought he might get by affecting a contempt for any opinion of\r\nClutton\xe2\x80\x99s; but Philip knew there was nothing which would give him more\r\npleasure than Clutton\xe2\x80\x99s praise. Clutton looked at the portrait for some\r\ntime in silence, then glanced at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s picture, which was standing\r\non an easel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I had a shot at a portrait too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sedulous ape,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nHe turned away again to Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s canvas. Philip reddened but did not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what d\xe2\x80\x99you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lawson at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe modelling\xe2\x80\x99s jolly good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clutton. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very well\r\ndrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think the values are all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson smiled with delight. He shook himself in his clothes like a wet\r\ndog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m jolly glad you like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s of the smallest importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson\xe2\x80\x99s face fell, and he stared at Clutton with astonishment: he had\r\nno notion what he meant, Clutton had no gift of expression in words,\r\nand he spoke as though it were an effort. What he had to say was\r\nconfused, halting, and verbose; but Philip knew the words which served\r\nas the text of his rambling discourse. Clutton, who never read, had\r\nheard them first from Cronshaw; and though they had made small\r\nimpression, they had remained in his memory; and lately, emerging on a\r\nsudden, had acquired the character of a revelation: a good painter had\r\ntwo chief objects to paint, namely, man and the intention of his soul.\r\nThe Impressionists had been occupied with other problems, they had\r\npainted man admirably, but they had troubled themselves as little as\r\nthe English portrait painters of the eighteenth century with the\r\nintention of his soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when you try to get that you become literary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson,\r\ninterrupting. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me paint the man like Manet, and the intention of\r\nhis soul can go to the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be all very well if you could beat Manet at his own game,\r\nbut you can\xe2\x80\x99t get anywhere near him. You can\xe2\x80\x99t feed yourself on the day\r\nbefore yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s ground which has been swept dry. You must go\r\nback. It\xe2\x80\x99s when I saw the Grecos that I felt one could get something\r\nmore out of portraits than we knew before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just going back to Ruskin,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lawson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94you see, he went for morality: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn for morality:\r\nteaching doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come in, ethics and all that, but passion and emotion.\r\nThe greatest portrait painters have painted both, man and the intention\r\nof his soul; Rembrandt and El Greco; it\xe2\x80\x99s only the second-raters who\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nonly painted man. A lily of the valley would be lovely even if it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t smell, but it\xe2\x80\x99s more lovely because it has perfume. That\r\npicture\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed to Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s portrait\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwell, the drawing\xe2\x80\x99s all right\r\nand so\xe2\x80\x99s the modelling all right, but just conventional; it ought to be\r\ndrawn and modelled so that you know the girl\xe2\x80\x99s a lousy slut.\r\nCorrectness is all very well: El Greco made his people eight feet high\r\nbecause he wanted to express something he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn El Greco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of jawing about a man\r\nwhen we haven\xe2\x80\x99t a chance of seeing any of his work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClutton shrugged his shoulders, smoked a cigarette in silence, and went\r\naway. Philip and Lawson looked at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something in what he says,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nLawson stared ill-temperedly at his picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow the devil is one to get the intention of the soul except by\r\npainting exactly what one sees?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout this time Philip made a new friend. On Monday morning models\r\nassembled at the school in order that one might be chosen for the week,\r\nand one day a young man was taken who was plainly not a model by\r\nprofession. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s attention was attracted by the manner in which he\r\nheld himself: when he got on to the stand he stood firmly on both feet,\r\nsquare, with clenched hands, and with his head defiantly thrown\r\nforward; the attitude emphasised his fine figure; there was no fat on\r\nhim, and his muscles stood out as though they were of iron. His head,\r\nclose-cropped, was well-shaped, and he wore a short beard; he had\r\nlarge, dark eyes and heavy eyebrows. He held the pose hour after hour\r\nwithout appearance of fatigue. There was in his mien a mixture of shame\r\nand of determination. His air of passionate energy excited Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nromantic imagination, and when, the sitting ended, he saw him in his\r\nclothes, it seemed to him that he wore them as though he were a king in\r\nrags. He was uncommunicative, but in a day or two Mrs. Otter told\r\nPhilip that the model was a Spaniard and that he had never sat before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he was starving,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you noticed his clothes? They\xe2\x80\x99re quite neat and decent, aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt chanced that Potter, one of the Americans who worked at Amitrano\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwas going to Italy for a couple of months, and offered his studio to\r\nPhilip. Philip was pleased. He was growing a little impatient of\r\nLawson\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory advice and wanted to be by himself. At the end of\r\nthe week he went up to the model and on the pretence that his drawing\r\nwas not finished asked whether he would come and sit to him one day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a model,\xe2\x80\x9d the Spaniard answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have other things to do\r\nnext week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and have luncheon with me now, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip, and as the other hesitated, he added with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhurt you to lunch with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a shrug of the shoulders the model consented, and they went off to\r\na cremerie. The Spaniard spoke broken French, fluent but difficult to\r\nfollow, and Philip managed to get on well enough with him. He found out\r\nthat he was a writer. He had come to Paris to write novels and kept\r\nhimself meanwhile by all the expedients possible to a penniless man; he\r\ngave lessons, he did any translations he could get hold of, chiefly\r\nbusiness documents, and at last had been driven to make money by his\r\nfine figure. Sitting was well paid, and what he had earned during the\r\nlast week was enough to keep him for two more; he told Philip, amazed,\r\nthat he could live easily on two francs a day; but it filled him with\r\nshame that he was obliged to show his body for money, and he looked\r\nupon sitting as a degradation which only hunger could excuse. Philip\r\nexplained that he did not want him to sit for the figure, but only for\r\nthe head; he wished to do a portrait of him which he might send to the\r\nnext Salon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you want to paint me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Spaniard.\r\n\r\nPhilip answered that the head interested him, he thought he could do a\r\ngood portrait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the time. I grudge every minute that I have to rob from\r\nmy writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it would only be in the afternoon. I work at the school in the\r\nmorning. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to sit to me than to do translations of\r\nlegal documents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were legends in the Latin quarter of a time when students of\r\ndifferent countries lived together intimately, but this was long since\r\npassed, and now the various nations were almost as much separated as in\r\nan Oriental city. At Julian\xe2\x80\x99s and at the Beaux Arts a French student\r\nwas looked upon with disfavour by his fellow-countrymen when he\r\nconsorted with foreigners, and it was difficult for an Englishman to\r\nknow more than quite superficially any native inhabitants of the city\r\nin which he dwelt. Indeed, many of the students after living in Paris\r\nfor five years knew no more French than served them in shops and lived\r\nas English a life as though they were working in South Kensington.\r\n\r\nPhilip, with his passion for the romantic, welcomed the opportunity to\r\nget in touch with a Spaniard; he used all his persuasiveness to\r\novercome the man\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Spaniard at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sit to\r\nyou, but not for money, for my own pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip expostulated, but the other was firm, and at length they\r\narranged that he should come on the following Monday at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He\r\ngave Philip a card on which was printed his name: Miguel Ajuria.\r\n\r\nMiguel sat regularly, and though he refused to accept payment he\r\nborrowed fifty francs from Philip every now and then: it was a little\r\nmore expensive than if Philip had paid for the sittings in the usual\r\nway; but gave the Spaniard a satisfactory feeling that he was not\r\nearning his living in a degrading manner. His nationality made Philip\r\nregard him as a representative of romance, and he asked him about\r\nSeville and Granada, Velasquez and Calderon. But Miguel had no patience\r\nwith the grandeur of his country. For him, as for so many of his\r\ncompatriots, France was the only country for a man of intelligence and\r\nParis the centre of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpain is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has no writers, it has no art, it has\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle by little, with the exuberant rhetoric of his race, he revealed\r\nhis ambitions. He was writing a novel which he hoped would make his\r\nname. He was under the influence of Zola, and he had set his scene in\r\nParis. He told Philip the story at length. To Philip it seemed crude\r\nand stupid; the naive obscenity\xe2\x80\x94c\xe2\x80\x99est la vie, mon cher, c\xe2\x80\x99est la vie,\r\nhe cried\xe2\x80\x94the naive obscenity served only to emphasise the\r\nconventionality of the anecdote. He had written for two years, amid\r\nincredible hardships, denying himself all the pleasures of life which\r\nhad attracted him to Paris, fighting with starvation for art\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\ndetermined that nothing should hinder his great achievement. The effort\r\nwas heroic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why don\xe2\x80\x99t you write about Spain?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be so\r\nmuch more interesting. You know the life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Paris is the only place worth writing about. Paris is life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne day he brought part of the manuscript, and in his bad French,\r\ntranslating excitedly as he went along so that Philip could scarcely\r\nunderstand, he read passages. It was lamentable. Philip, puzzled,\r\nlooked at the picture he was painting: the mind behind that broad brow\r\nwas trivial; and the flashing, passionate eyes saw nothing in life but\r\nthe obvious. Philip was not satisfied with his portrait, and at the end\r\nof a sitting he nearly always scraped out what he had done. It was all\r\nvery well to aim at the intention of the soul: who could tell what that\r\nwas when people seemed a mass of contradictions? He liked Miguel, and\r\nit distressed him to realise that his magnificent struggle was futile:\r\nhe had everything to make a good writer but talent. Philip looked at\r\nhis own work. How could you tell whether there was anything in it or\r\nwhether you were wasting your time? It was clear that the will to\r\nachieve could not help you and confidence in yourself meant nothing.\r\nPhilip thought of Fanny Price; she had a vehement belief in her talent;\r\nher strength of will was extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I thought I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be really good, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather give up\r\npainting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any use in being a second-rate\r\npainter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen one morning when he was going out, the concierge called out to him\r\nthat there was a letter. Nobody wrote to him but his Aunt Louisa and\r\nsometimes Hayward, and this was a handwriting he did not know. The\r\nletter was as follows:\r\n\r\nPlease come at once when you get this. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put up with it any\r\nmore. Please come yourself. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the thought that anyone else\r\nshould touch me. I want you to have everything.\r\n\r\nF. Price\r\n\r\nI have not had anything to eat for three days.\r\n\r\nPhilip felt on a sudden sick with fear. He hurried to the house in\r\nwhich she lived. He was astonished that she was in Paris at all. He had\r\nnot seen her for months and imagined she had long since returned to\r\nEngland. When he arrived he asked the concierge whether she was in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen her go out for two days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip ran upstairs and knocked at the door. There was no reply. He\r\ncalled her name. The door was locked, and on bending down he found the\r\nkey was in the lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, I hope she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done something awful,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried aloud.\r\n\r\nHe ran down and told the porter that she was certainly in the room. He\r\nhad had a letter from her and feared a terrible accident. He suggested\r\nbreaking open the door. The porter, who had been sullen and disinclined\r\nto listen, became alarmed; he could not take the responsibility of\r\nbreaking into the room; they must go for the commissaire de police.\r\nThey walked together to the bureau, and then they fetched a locksmith.\r\nPhilip found that Miss Price had not paid the last quarter\xe2\x80\x99s rent: on\r\nNew Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day she had not given the concierge the present which\r\nold-established custom led him to regard as a right. The four of them\r\nwent upstairs, and they knocked again at the door. There was no reply.\r\nThe locksmith set to work, and at last they entered the room. Philip\r\ngave a cry and instinctively covered his eyes with his hands. The\r\nwretched woman was hanging with a rope round her neck, which she had\r\ntied to a hook in the ceiling fixed by some previous tenant to hold up\r\nthe curtains of the bed. She had moved her own little bed out of the\r\nway and had stood on a chair, which had been kicked away. It was lying\r\non its side on the floor. They cut her down. The body was quite cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story which Philip made out in one way and another was terrible.\r\nOne of the grievances of the women-students was that Fanny Price would\r\nnever share their gay meals in restaurants, and the reason was obvious:\r\nshe had been oppressed by dire poverty. He remembered the luncheon they\r\nhad eaten together when first he came to Paris and the ghoulish\r\nappetite which had disgusted him: he realised now that she ate in that\r\nmanner because she was ravenous. The concierge told him what her food\r\nhad consisted of. A bottle of milk was left for her every day and she\r\nbrought in her own loaf of bread; she ate half the loaf and drank half\r\nthe milk at mid-day when she came back from the school, and consumed\r\nthe rest in the evening. It was the same day after day. Philip thought\r\nwith anguish of what she must have endured. She had never given anyone\r\nto understand that she was poorer than the rest, but it was clear that\r\nher money had been coming to an end, and at last she could not afford\r\nto come any more to the studio. The little room was almost bare of\r\nfurniture, and there were no other clothes than the shabby brown dress\r\nshe had always worn. Philip searched among her things for the address\r\nof some friend with whom he could communicate. He found a piece of\r\npaper on which his own name was written a score of times. It gave him a\r\npeculiar shock. He supposed it was true that she had loved him; he\r\nthought of the emaciated body, in the brown dress, hanging from the\r\nnail in the ceiling; and he shuddered. But if she had cared for him why\r\ndid she not let him help her? He would so gladly have done all he\r\ncould. He felt remorseful because he had refused to see that she looked\r\nupon him with any particular feeling, and now these words in her letter\r\nwere infinitely pathetic: I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the thought that anyone else\r\nshould touch me. She had died of starvation.\r\n\r\nPhilip found at length a letter signed: your loving brother, Albert. It\r\nwas two or three weeks old, dated from some road in Surbiton, and\r\nrefused a loan of five pounds. The writer had his wife and family to\r\nthink of, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel justified in lending money, and his advice was\r\nthat Fanny should come back to London and try to get a situation.\r\nPhilip telegraphed to Albert Price, and in a little while an answer\r\ncame:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeeply distressed. Very awkward to leave my business. Is presence\r\nessential. Price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip wired a succinct affirmative, and next morning a stranger\r\npresented himself at the studio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Price,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when Philip opened the door.\r\n\r\nHe was a commonish man in black with a band round his bowler hat; he\r\nhad something of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s clumsy look; he wore a stubbly moustache, and\r\nhad a cockney accent. Philip asked him to come in. He cast sidelong\r\nglances round the studio while Philip gave him details of the accident\r\nand told him what he had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI needn\xe2\x80\x99t see her, need I?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Albert Price. \xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves aren\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\nstrong, and it takes very little to upset me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to talk freely. He was a rubber-merchant, and he had a wife\r\nand three children. Fanny was a governess, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out why\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stuck to that instead of coming to Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe and Mrs. Price told her Paris was no place for a girl. And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno money in art\xe2\x80\x94never \xe2\x80\x99as been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plain enough that he had not been on friendly terms with his\r\nsister, and he resented her suicide as a last injury that she had done\r\nhim. He did not like the idea that she had been forced to it by\r\npoverty; that seemed to reflect on the family. The idea struck him that\r\npossibly there was a more respectable reason for her act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she \xe2\x80\x99adn\xe2\x80\x99t any trouble with a man, \xe2\x80\x99ad she? You know what I\r\nmean, Paris and all that. She might \xe2\x80\x99ave done it so as not to disgrace\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt himself reddening and cursed his weakness. Price\xe2\x80\x99s keen\r\nlittle eyes seemed to suspect him of an intrigue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe your sister to have been perfectly virtuous,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\r\nacidly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe killed herself because she was starving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s very \xe2\x80\x99ard on her family, Mr. Carey. She only \xe2\x80\x99ad to write\r\nto me. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let my sister want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had found the brother\xe2\x80\x99s address only by reading the letter in\r\nwhich he refused a loan; but he shrugged his shoulders: there was no\r\nuse in recrimination. He hated the little man and wanted to have done\r\nwith him as soon as possible. Albert Price also wished to get through\r\nthe necessary business quickly so that he could get back to London.\r\nThey went to the tiny room in which poor Fanny had lived. Albert Price\r\nlooked at the pictures and the furniture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know much about art,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose these\r\npictures would fetch something, would they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe furniture\xe2\x80\x99s not worth ten shillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlbert Price knew no French and Philip had to do everything. It seemed\r\nthat it was an interminable process to get the poor body safely hidden\r\naway under ground: papers had to be obtained in one place and signed in\r\nanother; officials had to be seen. For three days Philip was occupied\r\nfrom morning till night. At last he and Albert Price followed the\r\nhearse to the cemetery at Montparnasse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to do the thing decent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Albert Price, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\nwasting money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe short ceremony was infinitely dreadful in the cold gray morning.\r\nHalf a dozen people who had worked with Fanny Price at the studio came\r\nto the funeral, Mrs. Otter because she was massiere and thought it her\r\nduty, Ruth Chalice because she had a kind heart, Lawson, Clutton, and\r\nFlanagan. They had all disliked her during her life. Philip, looking\r\nacross the cemetery crowded on all sides with monuments, some poor and\r\nsimple, others vulgar, pretentious, and ugly, shuddered. It was\r\nhorribly sordid. When they came out Albert Price asked Philip to lunch\r\nwith him. Philip loathed him now and he was tired; he had not been\r\nsleeping well, for he dreamed constantly of Fanny Price in the torn\r\nbrown dress, hanging from the nail in the ceiling; but he could not\r\nthink of an excuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take me somewhere where we can get a regular slap-up lunch. All\r\nthis is the very worst thing for my nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLavenue\xe2\x80\x99s is about the best place round here,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\nAlbert Price settled himself on a velvet seat with a sigh of relief. He\r\nordered a substantial luncheon and a bottle of wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe threw out a few artful questions, and Philip discovered that he was\r\neager to hear about the painter\xe2\x80\x99s life in Paris. He represented it to\r\nhimself as deplorable, but he was anxious for details of the orgies\r\nwhich his fancy suggested to him. With sly winks and discreet\r\nsniggering he conveyed that he knew very well that there was a great\r\ndeal more than Philip confessed. He was a man of the world, and he knew\r\na thing or two. He asked Philip whether he had ever been to any of\r\nthose places in Montmartre which are celebrated from Temple Bar to the\r\nRoyal Exchange. He would like to say he had been to the Moulin Rouge.\r\nThe luncheon was very good and the wine excellent. Albert Price\r\nexpanded as the processes of digestion went satisfactorily forwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99ave a little brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when the coffee was brought, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nblow the expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x99alf a mind to stay over tonight and go back\r\ntomorrow. What d\xe2\x80\x99you say to spending the evening together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean you want me to take you round Montmartre tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see\r\nyou damned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be quite the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer was made so seriously that Philip was tickled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides it would be rotten for your nerves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely.\r\n\r\nAlbert Price concluded that he had better go back to London by the four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock train, and presently he took leave of Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and come\r\nover to Paris again one of these days and I\xe2\x80\x99ll look you up. And then we\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99alf go on the razzle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was too restless to work that afternoon, so he jumped on a bus\r\nand crossed the river to see whether there were any pictures on view at\r\nDurand-Ruel\xe2\x80\x99s. After that he strolled along the boulevard. It was cold\r\nand wind-swept. People hurried by wrapped up in their coats, shrunk\r\ntogether in an effort to keep out of the cold, and their faces were\r\npinched and careworn. It was icy underground in the cemetery at\r\nMontparnasse among all those white tombstones. Philip felt lonely in\r\nthe world and strangely homesick. He wanted company. At that hour\r\nCronshaw would be working, and Clutton never welcomed visitors; Lawson\r\nwas painting another portrait of Ruth Chalice and would not care to be\r\ndisturbed. He made up his mind to go and see Flanagan. He found him\r\npainting, but delighted to throw up his work and talk. The studio was\r\ncomfortable, for the American had more money than most of them, and\r\nwarm; Flanagan set about making tea. Philip looked at the two heads\r\nthat he was sending to the Salon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awful cheek my sending anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flanagan, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to send. D\xe2\x80\x99you think they\xe2\x80\x99re rotten?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so rotten as I should have expected,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nThey showed in fact an astounding cleverness. The difficulties had been\r\navoided with skill, and there was a dash about the way in which the\r\npaint was put on which was surprising and even attractive. Flanagan,\r\nwithout knowledge or technique, painted with the loose brush of a man\r\nwho has spent a lifetime in the practice of the art.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf one were forbidden to look at any picture for more than thirty\r\nseconds you\xe2\x80\x99d be a great master, Flanagan,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Philip.\r\n\r\nThese young people were not in the habit of spoiling one another with\r\nexcessive flattery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got time in America to spend more than thirty seconds in\r\nlooking at any picture,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the other.\r\n\r\nFlanagan, though he was the most scatter-brained person in the world,\r\nhad a tenderness of heart which was unexpected and charming. Whenever\r\nanyone was ill he installed himself as sick-nurse. His gaiety was\r\nbetter than any medicine. Like many of his countrymen he had not the\r\nEnglish dread of sentimentality which keeps so tight a hold on emotion;\r\nand, finding nothing absurd in the show of feeling, could offer an\r\nexuberant sympathy which was often grateful to his friends in distress.\r\nHe saw that Philip was depressed by what he had gone through and with\r\nunaffected kindliness set himself boisterously to cheer him up. He\r\nexaggerated the Americanisms which he knew always made the Englishmen\r\nlaugh and poured out a breathless stream of conversation, whimsical,\r\nhigh-spirited, and jolly. In due course they went out to dinner and\r\nafterwards to the Gaite Montparnasse, which was Flanagan\xe2\x80\x99s favourite\r\nplace of amusement. By the end of the evening he was in his most\r\nextravagant humour. He had drunk a good deal, but any inebriety from\r\nwhich he suffered was due much more to his own vivacity than to\r\nalcohol. He proposed that they should go to the Bal Bullier, and\r\nPhilip, feeling too tired to go to bed, willingly enough consented.\r\nThey sat down at a table on the platform at the side, raised a little\r\nfrom the level of the floor so that they could watch the dancing, and\r\ndrank a bock. Presently Flanagan saw a friend and with a wild shout\r\nleaped over the barrier on to the space where they were dancing. Philip\r\nwatched the people. Bullier was not the resort of fashion. It was\r\nThursday night and the place was crowded. There were a number of\r\nstudents of the various faculties, but most of the men were clerks or\r\nassistants in shops; they wore their everyday clothes, ready-made\r\ntweeds or queer tail-coats, and their hats, for they had brought them\r\nin with them, and when they danced there was no place to put them but\r\ntheir heads. Some of the women looked like servant-girls, and some were\r\npainted hussies, but for the most part they were shop-girls. They were\r\npoorly-dressed in cheap imitation of the fashions on the other side of\r\nthe river. The hussies were got up to resemble the music-hall artiste\r\nor the dancer who enjoyed notoriety at the moment; their eyes were\r\nheavy with black and their cheeks impudently scarlet. The hall was lit\r\nby great white lights, low down, which emphasised the shadows on the\r\nfaces; all the lines seemed to harden under it, and the colours were\r\nmost crude. It was a sordid scene. Philip leaned over the rail, staring\r\ndown, and he ceased to hear the music. They danced furiously. They\r\ndanced round the room, slowly, talking very little, with all their\r\nattention given to the dance. The room was hot, and their faces shone\r\nwith sweat. It seemed to Philip that they had thrown off the guard\r\nwhich people wear on their expression, the homage to convention, and he\r\nsaw them now as they really were. In that moment of abandon they were\r\nstrangely animal: some were foxy and some were wolf-like; and others\r\nhad the long, foolish face of sheep. Their skins were sallow from the\r\nunhealthy life they led and the poor food they ate. Their features were\r\nblunted by mean interests, and their little eyes were shifty and\r\ncunning. There was nothing of nobility in their bearing, and you felt\r\nthat for all of them life was a long succession of petty concerns and\r\nsordid thoughts. The air was heavy with the musty smell of humanity.\r\nBut they danced furiously as though impelled by some strange power\r\nwithin them, and it seemed to Philip that they were driven forward by a\r\nrage for enjoyment. They were seeking desperately to escape from a\r\nworld of horror. The desire for pleasure which Cronshaw said was the\r\nonly motive of human action urged them blindly on, and the very\r\nvehemence of the desire seemed to rob it of all pleasure. They were\r\nhurried on by a great wind, helplessly, they knew not why and they knew\r\nnot whither. Fate seemed to tower above them, and they danced as though\r\neverlasting darkness were beneath their feet. Their silence was vaguely\r\nalarming. It was as if life terrified them and robbed them of power of\r\nspeech so that the shriek which was in their hearts died at their\r\nthroats. Their eyes were haggard and grim; and notwithstanding the\r\nbeastly lust that disfigured them, and the meanness of their faces, and\r\nthe cruelty, notwithstanding the stupidness which was worst of all, the\r\nanguish of those fixed eyes made all that crowd terrible and pathetic.\r\nPhilip loathed them, and yet his heart ached with the infinite pity\r\nwhich filled him.\r\n\r\nHe took his coat from the cloak-room and went out into the bitter\r\ncoldness of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip could not get the unhappy event out of his head. What troubled\r\nhim most was the uselessness of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s effort. No one could have\r\nworked harder than she, nor with more sincerity; she believed in\r\nherself with all her heart; but it was plain that self-confidence meant\r\nvery little, all his friends had it, Miguel Ajuria among the rest; and\r\nPhilip was shocked by the contrast between the Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s heroic\r\nendeavour and the triviality of the thing he attempted. The unhappiness\r\nof Philip\xe2\x80\x99s life at school had called up in him the power of\r\nself-analysis; and this vice, as subtle as drug-taking, had taken\r\npossession of him so that he had now a peculiar keenness in the\r\ndissection of his feelings. He could not help seeing that art affected\r\nhim differently from others. A fine picture gave Lawson an immediate\r\nthrill. His appreciation was instinctive. Even Flanagan felt certain\r\nthings which Philip was obliged to think out. His own appreciation was\r\nintellectual. He could not help thinking that if he had in him the\r\nartistic temperament (he hated the phrase, but could discover no other)\r\nhe would feel beauty in the emotional, unreasoning way in which they\r\ndid. He began to wonder whether he had anything more than a superficial\r\ncleverness of the hand which enabled him to copy objects with accuracy.\r\nThat was nothing. He had learned to despise technical dexterity. The\r\nimportant thing was to feel in terms of paint. Lawson painted in a\r\ncertain way because it was his nature to, and through the imitativeness\r\nof a student sensitive to every influence, there pierced individuality.\r\nPhilip looked at his own portrait of Ruth Chalice, and now that three\r\nmonths had passed he realised that it was no more than a servile copy\r\nof Lawson. He felt himself barren. He painted with the brain, and he\r\ncould not help knowing that the only painting worth anything was done\r\nwith the heart.\r\n\r\nHe had very little money, barely sixteen hundred pounds, and it would\r\nbe necessary for him to practise the severest economy. He could not\r\ncount on earning anything for ten years. The history of painting was\r\nfull of artists who had earned nothing at all. He must resign himself\r\nto penury; and it was worth while if he produced work which was\r\nimmortal; but he had a terrible fear that he would never be more than\r\nsecond-rate. Was it worth while for that to give up one\xe2\x80\x99s youth, and\r\nthe gaiety of life, and the manifold chances of being? He knew the\r\nexistence of foreign painters in Paris enough to see that the lives\r\nthey led were narrowly provincial. He knew some who had dragged along\r\nfor twenty years in the pursuit of a fame which always escaped them\r\ntill they sunk into sordidness and alcoholism. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s suicide had\r\naroused memories, and Philip heard ghastly stories of the way in which\r\none person or another had escaped from despair. He remembered the\r\nscornful advice which the master had given poor Fanny: it would have\r\nbeen well for her if she had taken it and given up an attempt which was\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nPhilip finished his portrait of Miguel Ajuria and made up his mind to\r\nsend it to the Salon. Flanagan was sending two pictures, and he thought\r\nhe could paint as well as Flanagan. He had worked so hard on the\r\nportrait that he could not help feeling it must have merit. It was true\r\nthat when he looked at it he felt that there was something wrong,\r\nthough he could not tell what; but when he was away from it his spirits\r\nwent up and he was not dissatisfied. He sent it to the Salon and it was\r\nrefused. He did not mind much, since he had done all he could to\r\npersuade himself that there was little chance that it would be taken,\r\ntill Flanagan a few days later rushed in to tell Lawson and Philip that\r\none of his pictures was accepted. With a blank face Philip offered his\r\ncongratulations, and Flanagan was so busy congratulating himself that\r\nhe did not catch the note of irony which Philip could not prevent from\r\ncoming into his voice. Lawson, quicker-witted, observed it and looked\r\nat Philip curiously. His own picture was all right, he knew that a day\r\nor two before, and he was vaguely resentful of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s attitude. But\r\nhe was surprised at the sudden question which Philip put him as soon as\r\nthe American was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were in my place would you chuck the whole thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s worth while being a second-rate painter. You see, in\r\nother things, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a doctor or if you\xe2\x80\x99re in business, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter so much if you\xe2\x80\x99re mediocre. You make a living and you get along.\r\nBut what is the good of turning out second-rate pictures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson was fond of Philip and, as soon as he thought he was seriously\r\ndistressed by the refusal of his picture, he set himself to console\r\nhim. It was notorious that the Salon had refused pictures which were\r\nafterwards famous; it was the first time Philip had sent, and he must\r\nexpect a rebuff; Flanagan\xe2\x80\x99s success was explicable, his picture was\r\nshowy and superficial: it was just the sort of thing a languid jury\r\nwould see merit in. Philip grew impatient; it was humiliating that\r\nLawson should think him capable of being seriously disturbed by so\r\ntrivial a calamity and would not realise that his dejection was due to\r\na deep-seated distrust of his powers.\r\n\r\nOf late Clutton had withdrawn himself somewhat from the group who took\r\ntheir meals at Gravier\xe2\x80\x99s, and lived very much by himself. Flanagan said\r\nhe was in love with a girl, but Clutton\xe2\x80\x99s austere countenance did not\r\nsuggest passion; and Philip thought it more probable that he separated\r\nhimself from his friends so that he might grow clear with the new ideas\r\nwhich were in him. But that evening, when the others had left the\r\nrestaurant to go to a play and Philip was sitting alone, Clutton came\r\nin and ordered dinner. They began to talk, and finding Clutton more\r\nloquacious and less sardonic than usual, Philip determined to take\r\nadvantage of his good humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come and look at my picture,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\nknow what you think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, reddening.\r\n\r\nThe request was one which they all made of one another, and no one ever\r\nthought of refusing. Clutton shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople ask you for criticism, but they only want praise. Besides,\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of criticism? What does it matter if your picture is\r\ngood or bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The only reason that one paints is that one can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfunction like any of the other functions of the body, only\r\ncomparatively few people have got it. One paints for oneself: otherwise\r\none would commit suicide. Just think of it, you spend God knows how\r\nlong trying to get something on to canvas, putting the sweat of your\r\nsoul into it, and what is the result? Ten to one it will be refused at\r\nthe Salon; if it\xe2\x80\x99s accepted, people glance at it for ten seconds as\r\nthey pass; if you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky some ignorant fool will buy it and put it on\r\nhis walls and look at it as little as he looks at his dining-room\r\ntable. Criticism has nothing to do with the artist. It judges\r\nobjectively, but the objective doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern the artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClutton put his hands over his eyes so that he might concentrate his\r\nmind on what he wanted to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe artist gets a peculiar sensation from something he sees, and is\r\nimpelled to express it and, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know why, he can only express\r\nhis feeling by lines and colours. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a musician; he\xe2\x80\x99ll read a\r\nline or two, and a certain combination of notes presents itself to him:\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know why such and such words call forth in him such and such\r\nnotes; they just do. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you another reason why criticism is\r\nmeaningless: a great painter forces the world to see nature as he sees\r\nit; but in the next generation another painter sees the world in\r\nanother way, and then the public judges him not by himself but by his\r\npredecessor. So the Barbizon people taught our fathers to look at trees\r\nin a certain manner, and when Monet came along and painted differently,\r\npeople said: But trees aren\xe2\x80\x99t like that. It never struck them that\r\ntrees are exactly how a painter chooses to see them. We paint from\r\nwithin outwards\xe2\x80\x94if we force our vision on the world it calls us great\r\npainters; if we don\xe2\x80\x99t it ignores us; but we are the same. We don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nattach any meaning to greatness or to smallness. What happens to our\r\nwork afterwards is unimportant; we have got all we could out of it\r\nwhile we were doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause while Clutton with voracious appetite devoured the\r\nfood that was set before him. Philip, smoking a cheap cigar, observed\r\nhim closely. The ruggedness of the head, which looked as though it were\r\ncarved from a stone refractory to the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s chisel, the rough mane\r\nof dark hair, the great nose, and the massive bones of the jaw,\r\nsuggested a man of strength; and yet Philip wondered whether perhaps\r\nthe mask concealed a strange weakness. Clutton\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to show his\r\nwork might be sheer vanity: he could not bear the thought of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncriticism, and he would not expose himself to the chance of a refusal\r\nfrom the Salon; he wanted to be received as a master and would not risk\r\ncomparisons with other work which might force him to diminish his own\r\nopinion of himself. During the eighteen months Philip had known him\r\nClutton had grown more harsh and bitter; though he would not come out\r\ninto the open and compete with his fellows, he was indignant with the\r\nfacile success of those who did. He had no patience with Lawson, and\r\nthe pair were no longer on the intimate terms upon which they had been\r\nwhen Philip first knew them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLawson\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said contemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to\r\nEngland, become a fashionable portrait painter, earn ten thousand a\r\nyear and be an A. R. A. before he\xe2\x80\x99s forty. Portraits done by hand for\r\nthe nobility and gentry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, too, looked into the future, and he saw Clutton in twenty\r\nyears, bitter, lonely, savage, and unknown; still in Paris, for the\r\nlife there had got into his bones, ruling a small cenacle with a savage\r\ntongue, at war with himself and the world, producing little in his\r\nincreasing passion for a perfection he could not reach; and perhaps\r\nsinking at last into drunkenness. Of late Philip had been captivated by\r\nan idea that since one had only one life it was important to make a\r\nsuccess of it, but he did not count success by the acquiring of money\r\nor the achieving of fame; he did not quite know yet what he meant by\r\nit, perhaps variety of experience and the making the most of his\r\nabilities. It was plain anyway that the life which Clutton seemed\r\ndestined to was failure. Its only justification would be the painting\r\nof imperishable masterpieces. He recollected Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s whimsical\r\nmetaphor of the Persian carpet; he had thought of it often; but\r\nCronshaw with his faun-like humour had refused to make his meaning\r\nclear: he repeated that it had none unless one discovered it for\r\noneself. It was this desire to make a success of life which was at the\r\nbottom of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s uncertainty about continuing his artistic career.\r\nBut Clutton began to talk again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember my telling you about that chap I met in Brittany? I saw\r\nhim the other day here. He\xe2\x80\x99s just off to Tahiti. He was broke to the\r\nworld. He was a brasseur d\xe2\x80\x99affaires, a stockbroker I suppose you call\r\nit in English; and he had a wife and family, and he was earning a large\r\nincome. He chucked it all to become a painter. He just went off and\r\nsettled down in Brittany and began to paint. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got any money\r\nand did the next best thing to starving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about his wife and family?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he dropped them. He left them to starve on their own account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds a pretty low-down thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear fellow, if you want to be a gentleman you must give up\r\nbeing an artist. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to do with one another. You hear\r\nof men painting pot-boilers to keep an aged mother\xe2\x80\x94well, it shows\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re excellent sons, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for bad work. They\xe2\x80\x99re only\r\ntradesmen. An artist would let his mother go to the workhouse. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na writer I know over here who told me that his wife died in childbirth.\r\nHe was in love with her and he was mad with grief, but as he sat at the\r\nbedside watching her die he found himself making mental notes of how\r\nshe looked and what she said and the things he was feeling.\r\nGentlemanly, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is your friend a good painter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not yet, he paints just like Pissarro. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t found himself,\r\nbut he\xe2\x80\x99s got a sense of colour and a sense of decoration. But that\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t the question. It\xe2\x80\x99s the feeling, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s got. He\xe2\x80\x99s behaved\r\nlike a perfect cad to his wife and children, he\xe2\x80\x99s always behaving like\r\na perfect cad; the way he treats the people who\xe2\x80\x99ve helped him\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsometimes he\xe2\x80\x99s been saved from starvation merely by the kindness of his\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94is simply beastly. He just happens to be a great artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip pondered over the man who was willing to sacrifice everything,\r\ncomfort, home, money, love, honour, duty, for the sake of getting on to\r\ncanvas with paint the emotion which the world gave him. It was\r\nmagnificent, and yet his courage failed him.\r\n\r\nThinking of Cronshaw recalled to him the fact that he had not seen him\r\nfor a week, and so, when Clutton left him, he wandered along to the\r\ncafe in which he was certain to find the writer. During the first few\r\nmonths of his stay in Paris Philip had accepted as gospel all that\r\nCronshaw said, but Philip had a practical outlook and he grew impatient\r\nwith the theories which resulted in no action. Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s slim bundle\r\nof poetry did not seem a substantial result for a life which was\r\nsordid. Philip could not wrench out of his nature the instincts of the\r\nmiddle-class from which he came; and the penury, the hack work which\r\nCronshaw did to keep body and soul together, the monotony of existence\r\nbetween the slovenly attic and the cafe table, jarred with his\r\nrespectability. Cronshaw was astute enough to know that the young man\r\ndisapproved of him, and he attacked his philistinism with an irony\r\nwhich was sometimes playful but often very keen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a tradesman,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cyou want to invest life in\r\nconsols so that it shall bring you in a safe three per cent. I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nspendthrift, I run through my capital. I shall spend my last penny with\r\nmy last heartbeat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe metaphor irritated Philip, because it assumed for the speaker a\r\nromantic attitude and cast a slur upon the position which Philip\r\ninstinctively felt had more to say for it than he could think of at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nBut this evening Philip, undecided, wanted to talk about himself.\r\nFortunately it was late already and Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s pile of saucers on the\r\ntable, each indicating a drink, suggested that he was prepared to take\r\nan independent view of things in general.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99d give me some advice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t take it, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip shrugged his shoulders impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I shall ever do much good as a painter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nany use in being second-rate. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of chucking it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip hesitated for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I like the life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA change came over Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s placid, round face. The corners of the\r\nmouth were suddenly depressed, the eyes sunk dully in their orbits; he\r\nseemed to become strangely bowed and old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, looking round the cafe in which they sat. His voice\r\nreally trembled a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can get out of it, do while there\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip stared at him with astonishment, but the sight of emotion always\r\nmade him feel shy, and he dropped his eyes. He knew that he was looking\r\nupon the tragedy of failure. There was silence. Philip thought that\r\nCronshaw was looking upon his own life; and perhaps he considered his\r\nyouth with its bright hopes and the disappointments which wore out the\r\nradiancy; the wretched monotony of pleasure, and the black future.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes rested on the little pile of saucers, and he knew that\r\nCronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s were on them too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo months passed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Philip, brooding over these matters, that in the true\r\npainters, writers, musicians, there was a power which drove them to\r\nsuch complete absorption in their work as to make it inevitable for\r\nthem to subordinate life to art. Succumbing to an influence they never\r\nrealised, they were merely dupes of the instinct that possessed them,\r\nand life slipped through their fingers unlived. But he had a feeling\r\nthat life was to be lived rather than portrayed, and he wanted to\r\nsearch out the various experiences of it and wring from each moment all\r\nthe emotion that it offered. He made up his mind at length to take a\r\ncertain step and abide by the result, and, having made up his mind, he\r\ndetermined to take the step at once. Luckily enough the next morning\r\nwas one of Foinet\xe2\x80\x99s days, and he resolved to ask him point-blank\r\nwhether it was worth his while to go on with the study of art. He had\r\nnever forgotten the master\xe2\x80\x99s brutal advice to Fanny Price. It had been\r\nsound. Philip could never get Fanny entirely out of his head. The\r\nstudio seemed strange without her, and now and then the gesture of one\r\nof the women working there or the tone of a voice would give him a\r\nsudden start, reminding him of her: her presence was more noticable now\r\nshe was dead than it had ever been during her life; and he often\r\ndreamed of her at night, waking with a cry of terror. It was horrible\r\nto think of all the suffering she must have endured.\r\n\r\nPhilip knew that on the days Foinet came to the studio he lunched at a\r\nlittle restaurant in the Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Odessa, and he hurried his own meal so\r\nthat he could go and wait outside till the painter came out. Philip\r\nwalked up and down the crowded street and at last saw Monsieur Foinet\r\nwalking, with bent head, towards him; Philip was very nervous, but he\r\nforced himself to go up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, monsieur, I should like to speak to you for one moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFoinet gave him a rapid glance, recognised him, but did not smile a\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been working here nearly two years now under you. I wanted to ask\r\nyou to tell me frankly if you think it worth while for me to continue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s voice was trembling a little. Foinet walked on without looking\r\nup. Philip, watching his face, saw no trace of expression upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very poor. If I have no talent I would sooner do something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know if you have talent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my friends know they have talent, but I am aware some of them are\r\nmistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFoinet\xe2\x80\x99s bitter mouth outlined the shadow of a smile, and he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you live near here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip told him where his studio was. Foinet turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go there? You shall show me your work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had nothing to say. He walked silently by the master\xe2\x80\x99s side. He\r\nfelt horribly sick. It had never struck him that Foinet would wish to\r\nsee his things there and then; he meant, so that he might have time to\r\nprepare himself, to ask him if he would mind coming at some future date\r\nor whether he might bring them to Foinet\xe2\x80\x99s studio. He was trembling\r\nwith anxiety. In his heart he hoped that Foinet would look at his\r\npicture, and that rare smile would come into his face, and he would\r\nshake Philip\xe2\x80\x99s hand and say: \xe2\x80\x9cPas mal. Go on, my lad. You have talent,\r\nreal talent.\xe2\x80\x9d Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart swelled at the thought. It was such a\r\nrelief, such a joy! Now he could go on with courage; and what did\r\nhardship matter, privation, and disappointment, if he arrived at last?\r\nHe had worked very hard, it would be too cruel if all that industry\r\nwere futile. And then with a start he remembered that he had heard\r\nFanny Price say just that. They arrived at the house, and Philip was\r\nseized with fear. If he had dared he would have asked Foinet to go\r\naway. He did not want to know the truth. They went in and the concierge\r\nhanded him a letter as they passed. He glanced at the envelope and\r\nrecognised his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting. Foinet followed him up the stairs.\r\nPhilip could think of nothing to say; Foinet was mute, and the silence\r\ngot on his nerves. The professor sat down; and Philip without a word\r\nplaced before him the picture which the Salon had rejected; Foinet\r\nnodded but did not speak; then Philip showed him the two portraits he\r\nhad made of Ruth Chalice, two or three landscapes which he had painted\r\nat Moret, and a number of sketches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently, with a nervous laugh.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Foinet rolled himself a cigarette and lit it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have very little private means?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery little,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip, with a sudden feeling of cold at his\r\nheart. \xe2\x80\x9cNot enough to live on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing so degrading as the constant anxiety about one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmeans of livelihood. I have nothing but contempt for the people who\r\ndespise money. They are hypocrites or fools. Money is like a sixth\r\nsense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five.\r\nWithout an adequate income half the possibilities of life are shut off.\r\nThe only thing to be careful about is that you do not pay more than a\r\nshilling for the shilling you earn. You will hear people say that\r\npoverty is the best spur to the artist. They have never felt the iron\r\nof it in their flesh. They do not know how mean it makes you. It\r\nexposes you to endless humiliation, it cuts your wings, it eats into\r\nyour soul like a cancer. It is not wealth one asks for, but just enough\r\nto preserve one\xe2\x80\x99s dignity, to work unhampered, to be generous, frank,\r\nand independent. I pity with all my heart the artist, whether he writes\r\nor paints, who is entirely dependent for subsistence upon his art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip quietly put away the various things which he had shown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that sounds as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I had much chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Foinet slightly shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a certain manual dexterity. With hard work and perseverance\r\nthere is no reason why you should not become a careful, not incompetent\r\npainter. You would find hundreds who painted worse than you, hundreds\r\nwho painted as well. I see no talent in anything you have shown me. I\r\nsee industry and intelligence. You will never be anything but\r\nmediocre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip obliged himself to answer quite steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful to you for having taken so much trouble. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthank you enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Foinet got up and made as if to go, but he changed his mind\r\nand, stopping, put his hand on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you were to ask me my advice, I should say: take your courage\r\nin both hands and try your luck at something else. It sounds very hard,\r\nbut let me tell you this: I would give all I have in the world if\r\nsomeone had given me that advice when I was your age and I had taken\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked up at him with surprise. The master forced his lips into\r\na smile, but his eyes remained grave and sad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is cruel to discover one\xe2\x80\x99s mediocrity only when it is too late. It\r\ndoes not improve the temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a little laugh as he said the last words and quickly walked out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nPhilip mechanically took up the letter from his uncle. The sight of his\r\nhandwriting made him anxious, for it was his aunt who always wrote to\r\nhim. She had been ill for the last three months, and he had offered to\r\ngo over to England and see her; but she, fearing it would interfere\r\nwith his work, had refused. She did not want him to put himself to\r\ninconvenience; she said she would wait till August and then she hoped\r\nhe would come and stay at the vicarage for two or three weeks. If by\r\nany chance she grew worse she would let him know, since she did not\r\nwish to die without seeing him again. If his uncle wrote to him it must\r\nbe because she was too ill to hold a pen. Philip opened the letter. It\r\nran as follows:\r\n\r\nMy dear Philip,\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that your dear Aunt departed this life early\r\nthis morning. She died very suddenly, but quite peacefully. The change\r\nfor the worse was so rapid that we had no time to send for you. She was\r\nfully prepared for the end and entered into rest with the complete\r\nassurance of a blessed resurrection and with resignation to the divine\r\nwill of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ. Your Aunt would have liked you\r\nto be present at the funeral so I trust you will come as soon as you\r\ncan. There is naturally a great deal of work thrown upon my shoulders\r\nand I am very much upset. I trust that you will be able to do\r\neverything for me. Your affectionate uncle,\r\nWilliam Carey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day Philip arrived at Blackstable. Since the death of his mother\r\nhe had never lost anyone closely connected with him; his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nshocked him and filled him also with a curious fear; he felt for the\r\nfirst time his own mortality. He could not realise what life would be\r\nfor his uncle without the constant companionship of the woman who had\r\nloved and tended him for forty years. He expected to find him broken\r\ndown with hopeless grief. He dreaded the first meeting; he knew that he\r\ncould say nothing which would be of use. He rehearsed to himself a\r\nnumber of apposite speeches.\r\n\r\nHe entered the vicarage by the side-door and went into the dining-room.\r\nUncle William was reading the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour train was late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking up.\r\n\r\nPhilip was prepared to give way to his emotion, but the matter-of-fact\r\nreception startled him. His uncle, subdued but calm, handed him the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice little paragraph about her in The Blackstable\r\nTimes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPhilip read it mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to come up and see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip nodded and together they walked upstairs. Aunt Louisa was lying\r\nin the middle of the large bed, with flowers all round her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to say a short prayer?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar.\r\n\r\nHe sank on his knees, and because it was expected of him Philip\r\nfollowed his example. He looked at the little shrivelled face. He was\r\nonly conscious of one emotion: what a wasted life! In a minute Mr.\r\nCarey gave a cough, and stood up. He pointed to a wreath at the foot of\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s from the Squire,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He spoke in a low voice as though he\r\nwere in church, but one felt that, as a clergyman, he found himself\r\nquite at home. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect tea is ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went down again to the dining-room. The drawn blinds gave a\r\nlugubrious aspect. The Vicar sat at the end of the table at which his\r\nwife had always sat and poured out the tea with ceremony. Philip could\r\nnot help feeling that neither of them should have been able to eat\r\nanything, but when he saw that his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s appetite was unimpaired he\r\nfell to with his usual heartiness. They did not speak for a while.\r\nPhilip set himself to eat an excellent cake with the air of grief which\r\nhe felt was decent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings have changed a great deal since I was a curate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar\r\npresently. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my young days the mourners used always to be given a\r\npair of black gloves and a piece of black silk for their hats. Poor\r\nLouisa used to make the silk into dresses. She always said that twelve\r\nfunerals gave her a new dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he told Philip who had sent wreaths; there were twenty-four of\r\nthem already; when Mrs. Rawlingson, wife of the Vicar at Ferne, had\r\ndied she had had thirty-two; but probably a good many more would come\r\nthe next day; the funeral would start at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock from the\r\nvicarage, and they should beat Mrs. Rawlingson easily. Louisa never\r\nliked Mrs. Rawlingson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take the funeral myself. I promised Louisa I would never let\r\nanyone else bury her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at his uncle with disapproval when he took a second piece\r\nof cake. Under the circumstances he could not help thinking it greedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary Ann certainly makes capital cakes. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid no one else will\r\nmake such good ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not going?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip, with astonishment.\r\n\r\nMary Ann had been at the vicarage ever since he could remember. She\r\nnever forgot his birthday, but made a point always of sending him a\r\ntrifle, absurd but touching. He had a real affection for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Carey. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it would do to have a single\r\nwoman in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, good heavens, she must be over forty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think she is. But she\xe2\x80\x99s been rather troublesome lately, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen inclined to take too much on herself, and I thought this was a\r\nvery good opportunity to give her notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one which isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to recur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe took out a cigarette, but his uncle prevented him from lighting it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till after the funeral, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be quite respectful to smoke in the house so long as your\r\npoor Aunt Louisa is upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJosiah Graves, churchwarden and manager of the bank, came back to\r\ndinner at the vicarage after the funeral. The blinds had been drawn up,\r\nand Philip, against his will, felt a curious sensation of relief. The\r\nbody in the house had made him uncomfortable: in life the poor woman\r\nhad been all that was kind and gentle; and yet, when she lay upstairs\r\nin her bed-room, cold and stark, it seemed as though she cast upon the\r\nsurvivors a baleful influence. The thought horrified Philip.\r\n\r\nHe found himself alone for a minute or two in the dining-room with the\r\nchurchwarden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to stay with your uncle a while,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think he ought to be left alone just yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any plans,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he wants me I shall be\r\nvery pleased to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy way of cheering the bereaved husband the churchwarden during dinner\r\ntalked of a recent fire at Blackstable which had partly destroyed the\r\nWesleyan chapel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear they weren\xe2\x80\x99t insured,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a little smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll get as much\r\nmoney as they want to rebuild. Chapel people are always ready to give\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that Holden sent a wreath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolden was the dissenting minister, and, though for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake who\r\ndied for both of them, Mr. Carey nodded to him in the street, he did\r\nnot speak to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it was very pushing,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were forty-one\r\nwreaths. Yours was beautiful. Philip and I admired it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed with satisfaction that it was larger than anyone\xe2\x80\x99s else.\r\nIt had looked very well. They began to discuss the people who attended\r\nthe funeral. Shops had been closed for it, and the churchwarden took\r\nout of his pocket the notice which had been printed: \xe2\x80\x9cOwing to the\r\nfuneral of Mrs. Carey this establishment will not be opened till one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my idea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it was very nice of them to close,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nLouisa would have appreciated that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip ate his dinner. Mary Ann had treated the day as Sunday, and they\r\nhad roast chicken and a gooseberry tart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought about a tombstone yet?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nchurchwarden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have. I thought of a plain stone cross. Louisa was always\r\nagainst ostentation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think one can do much better than a cross. If you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking\r\nof a text, what do you say to: With Christ, which is far better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Vicar pursed his lips. It was just like Bismarck to try and settle\r\neverything himself. He did not like that text; it seemed to cast an\r\naspersion on himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should put that. I much prefer: The Lord has given and\r\nthe Lord has taken away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do you? That always seems to me a little indifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Vicar answered with some acidity, and Mr. Graves replied in a tone\r\nwhich the widower thought too authoritative for the occasion. Things\r\nwere going rather far if he could not choose his own text for his own\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s tombstone. There was a pause, and then the conversation drifted\r\nto parish matters. Philip went into the garden to smoke his pipe. He\r\nsat on a bench, and suddenly began to laugh hysterically.\r\n\r\nA few days later his uncle expressed the hope that he would spend the\r\nnext few weeks at Blackstable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that will suit me very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99ll do if you go back to Paris in September.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not reply. He had thought much of what Foinet said to him,\r\nbut he was still so undecided that he did not wish to speak of the\r\nfuture. There would be something fine in giving up art because he was\r\nconvinced that he could not excel; but unfortunately it would seem so\r\nonly to himself: to others it would be an admission of defeat, and he\r\ndid not want to confess that he was beaten. He was an obstinate fellow,\r\nand the suspicion that his talent did not lie in one direction made him\r\ninclined to force circumstances and aim notwithstanding precisely in\r\nthat direction. He could not bear that his friends should laugh at him.\r\nThis might have prevented him from ever taking the definite step of\r\nabandoning the study of painting, but the different environment made\r\nhim on a sudden see things differently. Like many another he discovered\r\nthat crossing the Channel makes things which had seemed important\r\nsingularly futile. The life which had been so charming that he could\r\nnot bear to leave it now seemed inept; he was seized with a distaste\r\nfor the cafes, the restaurants with their ill-cooked food, the shabby\r\nway in which they all lived. He did not care any more what his friends\r\nthought about him: Cronshaw with his rhetoric, Mrs. Otter with her\r\nrespectability, Ruth Chalice with her affectations, Lawson and Clutton\r\nwith their quarrels; he felt a revulsion from them all. He wrote to\r\nLawson and asked him to send over all his belongings. A week later they\r\narrived. When he unpacked his canvases he found himself able to examine\r\nhis work without emotion. He noticed the fact with interest. His uncle\r\nwas anxious to see his pictures. Though he had so greatly disapproved\r\nof Philip\xe2\x80\x99s desire to go to Paris, he accepted the situation now with\r\nequanimity. He was interested in the life of students and constantly\r\nput Philip questions about it. He was in fact a little proud of him\r\nbecause he was a painter, and when people were present made attempts to\r\ndraw him out. He looked eagerly at the studies of models which Philip\r\nshowed him. Philip set before him his portrait of Miguel Ajuria.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you paint him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wanted a model, and his head interested me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got anything to do here I wonder you don\xe2\x80\x99t paint me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would bore you to sit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must see about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was amused at his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s vanity. It was clear that he was dying\r\nto have his portrait painted. To get something for nothing was a chance\r\nnot to be missed. For two or three days he threw out little hints. He\r\nreproached Philip for laziness, asked him when he was going to start\r\nwork, and finally began telling everyone he met that Philip was going\r\nto paint him. At last there came a rainy day, and after breakfast Mr.\r\nCarey said to Philip:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what d\xe2\x80\x99you say to starting on my portrait this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip\r\nput down the book he was reading and leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve given up painting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his uncle in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s much object in being a second-rate painter, and\r\nI came to the conclusion that I should never be anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me. Before you went to Paris you were quite certain that\r\nyou were a genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought now you\xe2\x80\x99d taken up a profession you\xe2\x80\x99d have the\r\npride to stick to it. It seems to me that what you lack is\r\nperseverance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was a little annoyed that his uncle did not even see how truly\r\nheroic his determination was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A rolling stone gathers no moss,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the clergyman. Philip\r\nhated that proverb above all, and it seemed to him perfectly\r\nmeaningless. His uncle had repeated it often during the arguments which\r\nhad preceded his departure from business. Apparently it recalled that\r\noccasion to his guardian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re no longer a boy, you know; you must begin to think of settling\r\ndown. First you insist on becoming a chartered accountant, and then you\r\nget tired of that and you want to become a painter. And now if you\r\nplease you change your mind again. It points to\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for a moment to consider what defects of character exactly\r\nit indicated, and Philip finished the sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIrresolution, incompetence, want of foresight, and lack of\r\ndetermination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Vicar looked up at his nephew quickly to see whether he was\r\nlaughing at him. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s face was serious, but there was a twinkle in\r\nhis eyes which irritated him. Philip should really be getting more\r\nserious. He felt it right to give him a rap over the knuckles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour money matters have nothing to do with me now. You\xe2\x80\x99re your own\r\nmaster; but I think you should remember that your money won\xe2\x80\x99t last for\r\never, and the unlucky deformity you have doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly make it easier\r\nfor you to earn your living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip knew by now that whenever anyone was angry with him his first\r\nthought was to say something about his club-foot. His estimate of the\r\nhuman race was determined by the fact that scarcely anyone failed to\r\nresist the temptation. But he had trained himself not to show any sign\r\nthat the reminder wounded him. He had even acquired control over the\r\nblushing which in his boyhood had been one of his torments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you justly remark,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cmy money matters have nothing to\r\ndo with you and I am my own master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events you will do me the justice to acknowledge that I was\r\njustified in my opposition when you made up your mind to become an\r\nart-student.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know so much about that. I daresay one profits more by the\r\nmistakes one makes off one\xe2\x80\x99s own bat than by doing the right thing on\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s else advice. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my fling, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind settling\r\ndown now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was not prepared for the question, since in fact he had not made\r\nup his mind. He had thought of a dozen callings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe most suitable thing you could do is to enter your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprofession and become a doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOddly enough that is precisely what I intend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had thought of doctoring among other things, chiefly because it was\r\nan occupation which seemed to give a good deal of personal freedom, and\r\nhis experience of life in an office had made him determine never to\r\nhave anything more to do with one; his answer to the Vicar slipped out\r\nalmost unawares, because it was in the nature of a repartee. It amused\r\nhim to make up his mind in that accidental way, and he resolved then\r\nand there to enter his father\xe2\x80\x99s old hospital in the autumn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your two years in Paris may be regarded as so much wasted time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that. I had a very jolly two years, and I learned\r\none or two useful things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reflected for an instant, and his answer was not devoid of a\r\ngentle desire to annoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI learned to look at hands, which I\xe2\x80\x99d never looked at before. And\r\ninstead of just looking at houses and trees I learned to look at houses\r\nand trees against the sky. And I learned also that shadows are not\r\nblack but coloured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you think you\xe2\x80\x99re very clever. I think your flippancy is\r\nquite inane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking the paper with him Mr. Carey retired to his study. Philip\r\nchanged his chair for that in which his uncle had been sitting (it was\r\nthe only comfortable one in the room), and looked out of the window at\r\nthe pouring rain. Even in that sad weather there was something restful\r\nabout the green fields that stretched to the horizon. There was an\r\nintimate charm in the landscape which he did not remember ever to have\r\nnoticed before. Two years in France had opened his eyes to the beauty\r\nof his own countryside.\r\n\r\nHe thought with a smile of his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s remark. It was lucky that the\r\nturn of his mind tended to flippancy. He had begun to realise what a\r\ngreat loss he had sustained in the death of his father and mother. That\r\nwas one of the differences in his life which prevented him from seeing\r\nthings in the same way as other people. The love of parents for their\r\nchildren is the only emotion which is quite disinterested. Among\r\nstrangers he had grown up as best he could, but he had seldom been used\r\nwith patience or forbearance. He prided himself on his self-control. It\r\nhad been whipped into him by the mockery of his fellows. Then they\r\ncalled him cynical and callous. He had acquired calmness of demeanour\r\nand under most circumstances an unruffled exterior, so that now he\r\ncould not show his feelings. People told him he was unemotional; but he\r\nknew that he was at the mercy of his emotions: an accidental kindness\r\ntouched him so much that sometimes he did not venture to speak in order\r\nnot to betray the unsteadiness of his voice. He remembered the\r\nbitterness of his life at school, the humiliation which he had endured,\r\nthe banter which had made him morbidly afraid of making himself\r\nridiculous; and he remembered the loneliness he had felt since, faced\r\nwith the world, the disillusion and the disappointment caused by the\r\ndifference between what it promised to his active imagination and what\r\nit gave. But notwithstanding he was able to look at himself from the\r\noutside and smile with amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, if I weren\xe2\x80\x99t flippant, I should hang myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\nHis mind went back to the answer he had given his uncle when he asked\r\nhim what he had learnt in Paris. He had learnt a good deal more than he\r\ntold him. A conversation with Cronshaw had stuck in his memory, and one\r\nphrase he had used, a commonplace one enough, had set his brain\r\nworking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d Cronshaw said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as abstract\r\nmorality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Philip ceased to believe in Christianity he felt that a great\r\nweight was taken from his shoulders; casting off the responsibility\r\nwhich weighed down every action, when every action was infinitely\r\nimportant for the welfare of his immortal soul, he experienced a vivid\r\nsense of liberty. But he knew now that this was an illusion. When he\r\nput away the religion in which he had been brought up, he had kept\r\nunimpaired the morality which was part and parcel of it. He made up his\r\nmind therefore to think things out for himself. He determined to be\r\nswayed by no prejudices. He swept away the virtues and the vices, the\r\nestablished laws of good and evil, with the idea of finding out the\r\nrules of life for himself. He did not know whether rules were necessary\r\nat all. That was one of the things he wanted to discover. Clearly much\r\nthat seemed valid seemed so only because he had been taught it from his\r\nearliest youth. He had read a number of books, but they did not help\r\nhim much, for they were based on the morality of Christianity; and even\r\nthe writers who emphasised the fact that they did not believe in it\r\nwere never satisfied till they had framed a system of ethics in\r\naccordance with that of the Sermon on the Mount. It seemed hardly worth\r\nwhile to read a long volume in order to learn that you ought to behave\r\nexactly like everybody else. Philip wanted to find out how he ought to\r\nbehave, and he thought he could prevent himself from being influenced\r\nby the opinions that surrounded him. But meanwhile he had to go on\r\nliving, and, until he formed a theory of conduct, he made himself a\r\nprovisional rule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow your inclinations with due regard to the policeman round the\r\ncorner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought the best thing he had gained in Paris was a complete liberty\r\nof spirit, and he felt himself at last absolutely free. In a desultory\r\nway he had read a good deal of philosophy, and he looked forward with\r\ndelight to the leisure of the next few months. He began to read at\r\nhaphazard. He entered upon each system with a little thrill of\r\nexcitement, expecting to find in each some guide by which he could rule\r\nhis conduct; he felt himself like a traveller in unknown countries and\r\nas he pushed forward the enterprise fascinated him; he read\r\nemotionally, as other men read pure literature, and his heart leaped as\r\nhe discovered in noble words what himself had obscurely felt. His mind\r\nwas concrete and moved with difficulty in regions of the abstract; but,\r\neven when he could not follow the reasoning, it gave him a curious\r\npleasure to follow the tortuosities of thoughts that threaded their\r\nnimble way on the edge of the incomprehensible. Sometimes great\r\nphilosophers seemed to have nothing to say to him, but at others he\r\nrecognised a mind with which he felt himself at home. He was like the\r\nexplorer in Central Africa who comes suddenly upon wide uplands, with\r\ngreat trees in them and stretches of meadow, so that he might fancy\r\nhimself in an English park. He delighted in the robust common sense of\r\nThomas Hobbes; Spinoza filled him with awe, he had never before come in\r\ncontact with a mind so noble, so unapproachable and austere; it\r\nreminded him of that statue by Rodin, L\xe2\x80\x99Age d\xe2\x80\x99Airain, which he\r\npassionately admired; and then there was Hume: the scepticism of that\r\ncharming philosopher touched a kindred note in Philip; and, revelling\r\nin the lucid style which seemed able to put complicated thought into\r\nsimple words, musical and measured, he read as he might have read a\r\nnovel, a smile of pleasure on his lips. But in none could he find\r\nexactly what he wanted. He had read somewhere that every man was born a\r\nPlatonist, an Aristotelian, a Stoic, or an Epicurean; and the history\r\nof George Henry Lewes (besides telling you that philosophy was all\r\nmoonshine) was there to show that the thought of each philosopher was\r\ninseparably connected with the man he was. When you knew that you could\r\nguess to a great extent the philosophy he wrote. It looked as though\r\nyou did not act in a certain way because you thought in a certain way,\r\nbut rather that you thought in a certain way because you were made in a\r\ncertain way. Truth had nothing to do with it. There was no such thing\r\nas truth. Each man was his own philosopher, and the elaborate systems\r\nwhich the great men of the past had composed were only valid for the\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nThe thing then was to discover what one was and one\xe2\x80\x99s system of\r\nphilosophy would devise itself. It seemed to Philip that there were\r\nthree things to find out: man\xe2\x80\x99s relation to the world he lives in,\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s relation with the men among whom he lives, and finally man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelation to himself. He made an elaborate plan of study.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of living abroad is that, coming in contact with the\r\nmanners and customs of the people among whom you live, you observe them\r\nfrom the outside and see that they have not the necessity which those\r\nwho practise them believe. You cannot fail to discover that the beliefs\r\nwhich to you are self-evident to the foreigner are absurd. The year in\r\nGermany, the long stay in Paris, had prepared Philip to receive the\r\nsceptical teaching which came to him now with such a feeling of relief.\r\nHe saw that nothing was good and nothing was evil; things were merely\r\nadapted to an end. He read The Origin of Species. It seemed to offer an\r\nexplanation of much that troubled him. He was like an explorer now who\r\nhas reasoned that certain natural features must present themselves,\r\nand, beating up a broad river, finds here the tributary that he\r\nexpected, there the fertile, populated plains, and further on the\r\nmountains. When some great discovery is made the world is surprised\r\nafterwards that it was not accepted at once, and even on those who\r\nacknowledge its truth the effect is unimportant. The first readers of\r\nThe Origin of Species accepted it with their reason; but their\r\nemotions, which are the ground of conduct, were untouched. Philip was\r\nborn a generation after this great book was published, and much that\r\nhorrified its contemporaries had passed into the feeling of the time,\r\nso that he was able to accept it with a joyful heart. He was intensely\r\nmoved by the grandeur of the struggle for life, and the ethical rule\r\nwhich it suggested seemed to fit in with his predispositions. He said\r\nto himself that might was right. Society stood on one side, an organism\r\nwith its own laws of growth and self-preservation, while the individual\r\nstood on the other. The actions which were to the advantage of society\r\nit termed virtuous and those which were not it called vicious. Good and\r\nevil meant nothing more than that. Sin was a prejudice from which the\r\nfree man should rid himself. Society had three arms in its contest with\r\nthe individual, laws, public opinion, and conscience: the first two\r\ncould be met by guile, guile is the only weapon of the weak against the\r\nstrong: common opinion put the matter well when it stated that sin\r\nconsisted in being found out; but conscience was the traitor within the\r\ngates; it fought in each heart the battle of society, and caused the\r\nindividual to throw himself, a wanton sacrifice, to the prosperity of\r\nhis enemy. For it was clear that the two were irreconcilable, the state\r\nand the individual conscious of himself. THAT uses the individual for\r\nits own ends, trampling upon him if he thwarts it, rewarding him with\r\nmedals, pensions, honours, when he serves it faithfully; THIS, strong\r\nonly in his independence, threads his way through the state, for\r\nconvenience\xe2\x80\x99 sake, paying in money or service for certain benefits, but\r\nwith no sense of obligation; and, indifferent to the rewards, asks only\r\nto be left alone. He is the independent traveller, who uses Cook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntickets because they save trouble, but looks with good-humoured\r\ncontempt on the personally conducted parties. The free man can do no\r\nwrong. He does everything he likes\xe2\x80\x94if he can. His power is the only\r\nmeasure of his morality. He recognises the laws of the state and he can\r\nbreak them without sense of sin, but if he is punished he accepts the\r\npunishment without rancour. Society has the power.\r\n\r\nBut if for the individual there was no right and no wrong, then it\r\nseemed to Philip that conscience lost its power. It was with a cry of\r\ntriumph that he seized the knave and flung him from his breast. But he\r\nwas no nearer to the meaning of life than he had been before. Why the\r\nworld was there and what men had come into existence for at all was as\r\ninexplicable as ever. Surely there must be some reason. He thought of\r\nCronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s parable of the Persian carpet. He offered it as a solution\r\nof the riddle, and mysteriously he stated that it was no answer at all\r\nunless you found it out for yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what the devil he meant,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip smiled.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on the last day of September, eager to put into practice all\r\nthese new theories of life, Philip, with sixteen hundred pounds and his\r\nclub-foot, set out for the second time to London to make his third\r\nstart in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe examination Philip had passed before he was articled to a chartered\r\naccountant was sufficient qualification for him to enter a medical\r\nschool. He chose St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s because his father had been a student\r\nthere, and before the end of the summer session had gone up to London\r\nfor a day in order to see the secretary. He got a list of rooms from\r\nhim, and took lodgings in a dingy house which had the advantage of\r\nbeing within two minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk of the hospital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to arrange about a part to dissect,\xe2\x80\x9d the secretary told\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better start on a leg; they generally do; they seem to\r\nthink it easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip found that his first lecture was in anatomy, at eleven, and\r\nabout half past ten he limped across the road, and a little nervously\r\nmade his way to the Medical School. Just inside the door a number of\r\nnotices were pinned up, lists of lectures, football fixtures, and the\r\nlike; and these he looked at idly, trying to seem at his ease. Young\r\nmen and boys dribbled in and looked for letters in the rack, chatted\r\nwith one another, and passed downstairs to the basement, in which was\r\nthe student\xe2\x80\x99s reading-room. Philip saw several fellows with a\r\ndesultory, timid look dawdling around, and surmised that, like himself,\r\nthey were there for the first time. When he had exhausted the notices\r\nhe saw a glass door which led into what was apparently a museum, and\r\nhaving still twenty minutes to spare he walked in. It was a collection\r\nof pathological specimens. Presently a boy of about eighteen came up to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, are you first year?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the lecture room, d\xe2\x80\x99you know? It\xe2\x80\x99s getting on for eleven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better try to find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked out of the museum into a long, dark corridor, with the\r\nwalls painted in two shades of red, and other youths walking along\r\nsuggested the way to them. They came to a door marked Anatomy Theatre.\r\nPhilip found that there were a good many people already there. The\r\nseats were arranged in tiers, and just as Philip entered an attendant\r\ncame in, put a glass of water on the table in the well of the\r\nlecture-room and then brought in a pelvis and two thigh-bones, right\r\nand left. More men entered and took their seats and by eleven the\r\ntheatre was fairly full. There were about sixty students. For the most\r\npart they were a good deal younger than Philip, smooth-faced boys of\r\neighteen, but there were a few who were older than he: he noticed one\r\ntall man, with a fierce red moustache, who might have been thirty;\r\nanother little fellow with black hair, only a year or two younger; and\r\nthere was one man with spectacles and a beard which was quite gray.\r\n\r\nThe lecturer came in, Mr. Cameron, a handsome man with white hair and\r\nclean-cut features. He called out the long list of names. Then he made\r\na little speech. He spoke in a pleasant voice, with well-chosen words,\r\nand he seemed to take a discreet pleasure in their careful arrangement.\r\nHe suggested one or two books which they might buy and advised the\r\npurchase of a skeleton. He spoke of anatomy with enthusiasm: it was\r\nessential to the study of surgery; a knowledge of it added to the\r\nappreciation of art. Philip pricked up his ears. He heard later that\r\nMr. Cameron lectured also to the students at the Royal Academy. He had\r\nlived many years in Japan, with a post at the University of Tokyo, and\r\nhe flattered himself on his appreciation of the beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to learn many tedious things,\xe2\x80\x9d he finished, with an\r\nindulgent smile, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich you will forget the moment you have passed your\r\nfinal examination, but in anatomy it is better to have learned and lost\r\nthan never to have learned at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up the pelvis which was lying on the table and began to\r\ndescribe it. He spoke well and clearly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the lecture the boy who had spoken to Philip in the\r\npathological museum and sat next to him in the theatre suggested that\r\nthey should go to the dissecting-room. Philip and he walked along the\r\ncorridor again, and an attendant told them where it was. As soon as\r\nthey entered Philip understood what the acrid smell was which he had\r\nnoticed in the passage. He lit a pipe. The attendant gave a short\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get used to the smell. I don\xe2\x80\x99t notice it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe asked Philip\xe2\x80\x99s name and looked at a list on the board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a leg\xe2\x80\x94number four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip saw that another name was bracketed with his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re very short of bodies just now. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had to put two on each\r\npart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dissecting-room was a large apartment painted like the corridors,\r\nthe upper part a rich salmon and the dado a dark terra-cotta. At\r\nregular intervals down the long sides of the room, at right angles with\r\nthe wall, were iron slabs, grooved like meat-dishes; and on each lay a\r\nbody. Most of them were men. They were very dark from the preservative\r\nin which they had been kept, and the skin had almost the look of\r\nleather. They were extremely emaciated. The attendant took Philip up to\r\none of the slabs. A youth was standing by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your name Carey?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then we\xe2\x80\x99ve got this leg together. It\xe2\x80\x99s lucky it\xe2\x80\x99s a man, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey generally always like a male better,\xe2\x80\x9d said the attendant. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nfemale\xe2\x80\x99s liable to have a lot of fat about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at the body. The arms and legs were so thin that there\r\nwas no shape in them, and the ribs stood out so that the skin over them\r\nwas tense. A man of about forty-five with a thin, gray beard, and on\r\nhis skull scanty, colourless hair: the eyes were closed and the lower\r\njaw sunken. Philip could not feel that this had ever been a man, and\r\nyet in the row of them there was something terrible and ghastly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d start at two,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man who was dissecting\r\nwith Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had bought the day before the case of instruments which was needful,\r\nand now he was given a locker. He looked at the boy who had accompanied\r\nhim into the dissecting-room and saw that he was white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake you feel rotten?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anyone dead before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked along the corridor till they came to the entrance of the\r\nschool. Philip remembered Fanny Price. She was the first dead person he\r\nhad ever seen, and he remembered how strangely it had affected him.\r\nThere was an immeasurable distance between the quick and the dead: they\r\ndid not seem to belong to the same species; and it was strange to think\r\nthat but a little while before they had spoken and moved and eaten and\r\nlaughed. There was something horrible about the dead, and you could\r\nimagine that they might cast an evil influence on the living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you say to having something to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d said his new friend to\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\nThey went down into the basement, where there was a dark room fitted up\r\nas a restaurant, and here the students were able to get the same sort\r\nof fare as they might have at an aerated bread shop. While they ate\r\n(Philip had a scone and butter and a cup of chocolate), he discovered\r\nthat his companion was called Dunsford. He was a fresh-complexioned\r\nlad, with pleasant blue eyes and curly, dark hair, large-limbed, slow\r\nof speech and movement. He had just come from Clifton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you taking the Conjoint?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I want to get qualified as soon as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m taking it too, but I shall take the F. R. C. S. afterwards. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing in for surgery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMost of the students took the curriculum of the Conjoint Board of the\r\nCollege of Surgeons and the College of Physicians; but the more\r\nambitious or the more industrious added to this the longer studies\r\nwhich led to a degree from the University of London. When Philip went\r\nto St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s changes had recently been made in the regulations, and\r\nthe course took five years instead of four as it had done for those who\r\nregistered before the autumn of 1892. Dunsford was well up in his plans\r\nand told Philip the usual course of events. The \xe2\x80\x9cfirst conjoint\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexamination consisted of biology, anatomy, and chemistry; but it could\r\nbe taken in sections, and most fellows took their biology three months\r\nafter entering the school. This science had been recently added to the\r\nlist of subjects upon which the student was obliged to inform himself,\r\nbut the amount of knowledge required was very small.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip went back to the dissecting-room, he was a few minutes\r\nlate, since he had forgotten to buy the loose sleeves which they wore\r\nto protect their shirts, and he found a number of men already working.\r\nHis partner had started on the minute and was busy dissecting out\r\ncutaneous nerves. Two others were engaged on the second leg, and more\r\nwere occupied with the arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my having started?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, fire away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe took the book, open at a diagram of the dissected part, and looked\r\nat what they had to find.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re rather a dab at this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a good deal of dissecting before, animals, you know, for\r\nthe Pre Sci.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a certain amount of conversation over the dissecting-table,\r\npartly about the work, partly about the prospects of the football\r\nseason, the demonstrators, and the lectures. Philip felt himself a\r\ngreat deal older than the others. They were raw schoolboys. But age is\r\na matter of knowledge rather than of years; and Newson, the active\r\nyoung man who was dissecting with him, was very much at home with his\r\nsubject. He was perhaps not sorry to show off, and he explained very\r\nfully to Philip what he was about. Philip, notwithstanding his hidden\r\nstores of wisdom, listened meekly. Then Philip took up the scalpel and\r\nthe tweezers and began working while the other looked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRipping to have him so thin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newson, wiping his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nblighter can\xe2\x80\x99t have had anything to eat for a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what he died of,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, any old thing, starvation chiefly, I suppose\xe2\x80\xa6. I\r\nsay, look out, don\xe2\x80\x99t cut that artery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine to say, don\xe2\x80\x99t cut that artery,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked one of the\r\nmen working on the opposite leg. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly old fool\xe2\x80\x99s got an artery in the\r\nwrong place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArteries always are in the wrong place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newson. \xe2\x80\x9cThe normal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe one thing you practically never get. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s called the\r\nnormal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cor I shall cut myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you cut yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Newson, full of information, \xe2\x80\x9cwash it\r\nat once with antiseptic. It\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be careful\r\nabout. There was a chap here last year who gave himself only a prick,\r\nand he didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother about it, and he got septicaemia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he get all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, he died in a week. I went and had a look at him in the P. M.\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s back ached by the time it was proper to have tea, and his\r\nluncheon had been so light that he was quite ready for it. His hands\r\nsmelt of that peculiar odour which he had first noticed that morning in\r\nthe corridor. He thought his muffin tasted of it too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newson. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the\r\ngood old dissecting-room stink about, you feel quite lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let it spoil my appetite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, as he\r\nfollowed up the muffin with a piece of cake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of the life of medical students, like those of the\r\npublic at large, were founded on the pictures which Charles Dickens\r\ndrew in the middle of the nineteenth century. He soon discovered that\r\nBob Sawyer, if he ever existed, was no longer at all like the medical\r\nstudent of the present.\r\n\r\nIt is a mixed lot which enters upon the medical profession, and\r\nnaturally there are some who are lazy and reckless. They think it is an\r\neasy life, idle away a couple of years; and then, because their funds\r\ncome to an end or because angry parents refuse any longer to support\r\nthem, drift away from the hospital. Others find the examinations too\r\nhard for them; one failure after another robs them of their nerve; and,\r\npanic-stricken, they forget as soon as they come into the forbidding\r\nbuildings of the Conjoint Board the knowledge which before they had so\r\npat. They remain year after year, objects of good-humoured scorn to\r\nyounger men: some of them crawl through the examination of the\r\nApothecaries Hall; others become non-qualified assistants, a precarious\r\nposition in which they are at the mercy of their employer; their lot is\r\npoverty, drunkenness, and Heaven only knows their end. But for the most\r\npart medical students are industrious young men of the middle-class\r\nwith a sufficient allowance to live in the respectable fashion they\r\nhave been used to; many are the sons of doctors who have already\r\nsomething of the professional manner; their career is mapped out: as\r\nsoon as they are qualified they propose to apply for a hospital\r\nappointment, after holding which (and perhaps a trip to the Far East as\r\na ship\xe2\x80\x99s doctor), they will join their father and spend the rest of\r\ntheir days in a country practice. One or two are marked out as\r\nexceptionally brilliant: they will take the various prizes and\r\nscholarships which are open each year to the deserving, get one\r\nappointment after another at the hospital, go on the staff, take a\r\nconsulting-room in Harley Street, and, specialising in one subject or\r\nanother, become prosperous, eminent, and titled.\r\n\r\nThe medical profession is the only one which a man may enter at any age\r\nwith some chance of making a living. Among the men of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s year\r\nwere three or four who were past their first youth: one had been in the\r\nNavy, from which according to report he had been dismissed for\r\ndrunkenness; he was a man of thirty, with a red face, a brusque manner,\r\nand a loud voice. Another was a married man with two children, who had\r\nlost money through a defaulting solicitor; he had a bowed look as if\r\nthe world were too much for him; he went about his work silently, and\r\nit was plain that he found it difficult at his age to commit facts to\r\nmemory. His mind worked slowly. His effort at application was painful\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nPhilip made himself at home in his tiny rooms. He arranged his books\r\nand hung on the walls such pictures and sketches as he possessed. Above\r\nhim, on the drawing-room floor, lived a fifth-year man called\r\nGriffiths; but Philip saw little of him, partly because he was occupied\r\nchiefly in the wards and partly because he had been to Oxford. Such of\r\nthe students as had been to a university kept a good deal together:\r\nthey used a variety of means natural to the young in order to impress\r\nupon the less fortunate a proper sense of their inferiority; the rest\r\nof the students found their Olympian serenity rather hard to bear.\r\nGriffiths was a tall fellow, with a quantity of curly red hair and blue\r\neyes, a white skin and a very red mouth; he was one of those fortunate\r\npeople whom everybody liked, for he had high spirits and a constant\r\ngaiety. He strummed a little on the piano and sang comic songs with\r\ngusto; and evening after evening, while Philip was reading in his\r\nsolitary room, he heard the shouts and the uproarious laughter of\r\nGriffiths\xe2\x80\x99 friends above him. He thought of those delightful evenings\r\nin Paris when they would sit in the studio, Lawson and he, Flanagan and\r\nClutton, and talk of art and morals, the love-affairs of the present,\r\nand the fame of the future. He felt sick at heart. He found that it was\r\neasy to make a heroic gesture, but hard to abide by its results. The\r\nworst of it was that the work seemed to him very tedious. He had got\r\nout of the habit of being asked questions by demonstrators. His\r\nattention wandered at lectures. Anatomy was a dreary science, a mere\r\nmatter of learning by heart an enormous number of facts; dissection\r\nbored him; he did not see the use of dissecting out laboriously nerves\r\nand arteries when with much less trouble you could see in the diagrams\r\nof a book or in the specimens of the pathological museum exactly where\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nHe made friends by chance, but not intimate friends, for he seemed to\r\nhave nothing in particular to say to his companions. When he tried to\r\ninterest himself in their concerns, he felt that they found him\r\npatronising. He was not of those who can talk of what moves them\r\nwithout caring whether it bores or not the people they talk to. One\r\nman, hearing that he had studied art in Paris, and fancying himself on\r\nhis taste, tried to discuss art with him; but Philip was impatient of\r\nviews which did not agree with his own; and, finding quickly that the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s ideas were conventional, grew monosyllabic. Philip desired\r\npopularity but could bring himself to make no advances to others. A\r\nfear of rebuff prevented him from affability, and he concealed his\r\nshyness, which was still intense, under a frigid taciturnity. He was\r\ngoing through the same experience as he had done at school, but here\r\nthe freedom of the medical students\xe2\x80\x99 life made it possible for him to\r\nlive a good deal by himself.\r\n\r\nIt was through no effort of his that he became friendly with Dunsford,\r\nthe fresh-complexioned, heavy lad whose acquaintance he had made at the\r\nbeginning of the session. Dunsford attached himself to Philip merely\r\nbecause he was the first person he had known at St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s. He had no\r\nfriends in London, and on Saturday nights he and Philip got into the\r\nhabit of going together to the pit of a music-hall or the gallery of a\r\ntheatre. He was stupid, but he was good-humoured and never took\r\noffence; he always said the obvious thing, but when Philip laughed at\r\nhim merely smiled. He had a very sweet smile. Though Philip made him\r\nhis butt, he liked him; he was amused by his candour and delighted with\r\nhis agreeable nature: Dunsford had the charm which himself was acutely\r\nconscious of not possessing.\r\n\r\nThey often went to have tea at a shop in Parliament Street, because\r\nDunsford admired one of the young women who waited. Philip did not find\r\nanything attractive in her. She was tall and thin, with narrow hips and\r\nthe chest of a boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one would look at her in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got a ripping face,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat DOES the face matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had the small regular features, the blue eyes, and the broad low\r\nbrow, which the Victorian painters, Lord Leighton, Alma Tadema, and a\r\nhundred others, induced the world they lived in to accept as a type of\r\nGreek beauty. She seemed to have a great deal of hair: it was arranged\r\nwith peculiar elaboration and done over the forehead in what she called\r\nan Alexandra fringe. She was very anaemic. Her thin lips were pale, and\r\nher skin was delicate, of a faint green colour, without a touch of red\r\neven in the cheeks. She had very good teeth. She took great pains to\r\nprevent her work from spoiling her hands, and they were small, thin,\r\nand white. She went about her duties with a bored look.\r\n\r\nDunsford, very shy with women, had never succeeded in getting into\r\nconversation with her; and he urged Philip to help him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I want is a lead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I can manage for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, to please him, made one or two remarks, but she answered with\r\nmonosyllables. She had taken their measure. They were boys, and she\r\nsurmised they were students. She had no use for them. Dunsford noticed\r\nthat a man with sandy hair and a bristly moustache, who looked like a\r\nGerman, was favoured with her attention whenever he came into the shop;\r\nand then it was only by calling her two or three times that they could\r\ninduce her to take their order. She used the clients whom she did not\r\nknow with frigid insolence, and when she was talking to a friend was\r\nperfectly indifferent to the calls of the hurried. She had the art of\r\ntreating women who desired refreshment with just that degree of\r\nimpertinence which irritated them without affording them an opportunity\r\nof complaining to the management. One day Dunsford told him her name\r\nwas Mildred. He had heard one of the other girls in the shop address\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an odious name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dunsford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so pretentious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt chanced that on this day the German was not there, and, when she\r\nbrought the tea, Philip, smiling, remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend\xe2\x80\x99s not here today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was referring to the nobleman with the sandy moustache. Has he left\r\nyou for another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people would do better to mind their own business,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted.\r\n\r\nShe left them, and, since for a minute or two there was no one to\r\nattend to, sat down and looked at the evening paper which a customer\r\nhad left behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a fool to put her back up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really quite indifferent to the attitude of her vertebrae,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Philip.\r\n\r\nBut he was piqued. It irritated him that when he tried to be agreeable\r\nwith a woman she should take offence. When he asked for the bill, he\r\nhazarded a remark which he meant to lead further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we no longer on speaking terms?\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here to take orders and to wait on customers. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to\r\nsay to them, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to say anything to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put down the slip of paper on which she had marked the sum they had\r\nto pay, and walked back to the table at which she had been sitting.\r\nPhilip flushed with anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one in the eye for you, Carey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsford, when they got\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIll-mannered slut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t go there again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis influence with Dunsford was strong enough to get him to take their\r\ntea elsewhere, and Dunsford soon found another young woman to flirt\r\nwith. But the snub which the waitress had inflicted on him rankled. If\r\nshe had treated him with civility he would have been perfectly\r\nindifferent to her; but it was obvious that she disliked him rather\r\nthan otherwise, and his pride was wounded. He could not suppress a\r\ndesire to be even with her. He was impatient with himself because he\r\nhad so petty a feeling, but three or four days\xe2\x80\x99 firmness, during which\r\nhe would not go to the shop, did not help him to surmount it; and he\r\ncame to the conclusion that it would be least trouble to see her.\r\nHaving done so he would certainly cease to think of her. Pretexting an\r\nappointment one afternoon, for he was not a little ashamed of his\r\nweakness, he left Dunsford and went straight to the shop which he had\r\nvowed never again to enter. He saw the waitress the moment he came in\r\nand sat down at one of her tables. He expected her to make some\r\nreference to the fact that he had not been there for a week, but when\r\nshe came up for his order she said nothing. He had heard her say to\r\nother customers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave no sign that she had ever seen him before. In order to see\r\nwhether she had really forgotten him, when she brought his tea, he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen my friend tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s not been in here for some days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wanted to use this as the beginning of a conversation, but he was\r\nstrangely nervous and could think of nothing to say. She gave him no\r\nopportunity, but at once went away. He had no chance of saying anything\r\ntill he asked for his bill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFilthy weather, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nIt was mortifying that he had been forced to prepare such a phrase as\r\nthat. He could not make out why she filled him with such embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t make much difference to me what the weather is, having to be\r\nin here all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an insolence in her tone that peculiarly irritated him. A\r\nsarcasm rose to his lips, but he forced himself to be silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to God she\xe2\x80\x99d say something really cheeky,\xe2\x80\x9d he raged to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cso that I could report her and get her sacked. It would serve her\r\ndamned well right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI\r\n\r\n\r\nHe could not get her out of his mind. He laughed angrily at his own\r\nfoolishness: it was absurd to care what an anaemic little waitress said\r\nto him; but he was strangely humiliated. Though no one knew of the\r\nhumiliation but Dunsford, and he had certainly forgotten, Philip felt\r\nthat he could have no peace till he had wiped it out. He thought over\r\nwhat he had better do. He made up his mind that he would go to the shop\r\nevery day; it was obvious that he had made a disagreeable impression on\r\nher, but he thought he had the wits to eradicate it; he would take care\r\nnot to say anything at which the most susceptible person could be\r\noffended. All this he did, but it had no effect. When he went in and\r\nsaid good-evening she answered with the same words, but when once he\r\nomitted to say it in order to see whether she would say it first, she\r\nsaid nothing at all. He murmured in his heart an expression which\r\nthough frequently applicable to members of the female sex is not often\r\nused of them in polite society; but with an unmoved face he ordered his\r\ntea. He made up his mind not to speak a word, and left the shop without\r\nhis usual good-night. He promised himself that he would not go any\r\nmore, but the next day at tea-time he grew restless. He tried to think\r\nof other things, but he had no command over his thoughts. At last he\r\nsaid desperately:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go if I want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe struggle with himself had taken a long time, and it was getting on\r\nfor seven when he entered the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you weren\xe2\x80\x99t coming,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said to him, when he sat down.\r\n\r\nHis heart leaped in his bosom and he felt himself reddening. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\ndetained. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCutting up people, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so bad as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a stoodent, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that seemed to satisfy her curiosity. She went away and, since at\r\nthat late hour there was nobody else at her tables, she immersed\r\nherself in a novelette. This was before the time of the sixpenny\r\nreprints. There was a regular supply of inexpensive fiction written to\r\norder by poor hacks for the consumption of the illiterate. Philip was\r\nelated; she had addressed him of her own accord; he saw the time\r\napproaching when his turn would come and he would tell her exactly what\r\nhe thought of her. It would be a great comfort to express the immensity\r\nof his contempt. He looked at her. It was true that her profile was\r\nbeautiful; it was extraordinary how English girls of that class had so\r\noften a perfection of outline which took your breath away, but it was\r\nas cold as marble; and the faint green of her delicate skin gave an\r\nimpression of unhealthiness. All the waitresses were dressed alike, in\r\nplain black dresses, with a white apron, cuffs, and a small cap. On a\r\nhalf sheet of paper that he had in his pocket Philip made a sketch of\r\nher as she sat leaning over her book (she outlined the words with her\r\nlips as she read), and left it on the table when he went away. It was\r\nan inspiration, for next day, when he came in, she smiled at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you could draw,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was an art-student in Paris for two years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI showed that drawing you left be\xe2\x80\x99ind you last night to the manageress\r\nand she WAS struck with it. Was it meant to be me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nWhen she went for his tea, one of the other girls came up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw that picture you done of Miss Rogers. It was the very image of\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThat was the first time he had heard her name, and when he wanted his\r\nbill he called her by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you know my name,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when she came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend mentioned it when she said something to me about that\r\ndrawing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants you to do one of her. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you do it. If you once begin\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go on, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll all be wanting you to do them.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nwithout a pause, with peculiar inconsequence, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nyoung fellow that used to come with you? Has he gone away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy your remembering him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a nice-looking young fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt quite a peculiar sensation in his heart. He did not know\r\nwhat it was. Dunsford had jolly curling hair, a fresh complexion, and a\r\nbeautiful smile. Philip thought of these advantages with envy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s in love,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a little laugh.\r\n\r\nPhilip repeated every word of the conversation to himself as he limped\r\nhome. She was quite friendly with him now. When opportunity arose he\r\nwould offer to make a more finished sketch of her, he was sure she\r\nwould like that; her face was interesting, the profile was lovely, and\r\nthere was something curiously fascinating about the chlorotic colour.\r\nHe tried to think what it was like; at first he thought of pea soup;\r\nbut, driving away that idea angrily, he thought of the petals of a\r\nyellow rosebud when you tore it to pieces before it had burst. He had\r\nno ill-feeling towards her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad sort,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nIt was silly of him to take offence at what she had said; it was\r\ndoubtless his own fault; she had not meant to make herself\r\ndisagreeable: he ought to be accustomed by now to making at first sight\r\na bad impression on people. He was flattered at the success of his\r\ndrawing; she looked upon him with more interest now that she was aware\r\nof this small talent. He was restless next day. He thought of going to\r\nlunch at the tea-shop, but he was certain there would be many people\r\nthere then, and Mildred would not be able to talk to him. He had\r\nmanaged before this to get out of having tea with Dunsford, and,\r\npunctually at half past four (he had looked at his watch a dozen\r\ntimes), he went into the shop.\r\n\r\nMildred had her back turned to him. She was sitting down, talking to\r\nthe German whom Philip had seen there every day till a fortnight ago\r\nand since then had not seen at all. She was laughing at what he said.\r\nPhilip thought she had a common laugh, and it made him shudder. He\r\ncalled her, but she took no notice; he called her again; then, growing\r\nangry, for he was impatient, he rapped the table loudly with his stick.\r\nShe approached sulkily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be in a great hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked down at him with the insolent manner which he knew so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll kindly give your order I\xe2\x80\x99ll get what you want. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\ntalking all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTea and toasted bun, please,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip answered briefly.\r\n\r\nHe was furious with her. He had The Star with him and read it\r\nelaborately when she brought the tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me my bill now I needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nicily.\r\n\r\nShe wrote out the slip, placed it on the table, and went back to the\r\nGerman. Soon she was talking to him with animation. He was a man of\r\nmiddle height, with the round head of his nation and a sallow face; his\r\nmoustache was large and bristling; he had on a tail-coat and gray\r\ntrousers, and he wore a massive gold watch-chain. Philip thought the\r\nother girls looked from him to the pair at the table and exchanged\r\nsignificant glances. He felt certain they were laughing at him, and his\r\nblood boiled. He detested Mildred now with all his heart. He knew that\r\nthe best thing he could do was to cease coming to the tea-shop, but he\r\ncould not bear to think that he had been worsted in the affair, and he\r\ndevised a plan to show her that he despised her. Next day he sat down\r\nat another table and ordered his tea from another waitress. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend was there again and she was talking to him. She paid no\r\nattention to Philip, and so when he went out he chose a moment when she\r\nhad to cross his path: as he passed he looked at her as though he had\r\nnever seen her before. He repeated this for three or four days. He\r\nexpected that presently she would take the opportunity to say something\r\nto him; he thought she would ask why he never came to one of her tables\r\nnow, and he had prepared an answer charged with all the loathing he\r\nfelt for her. He knew it was absurd to trouble, but he could not help\r\nhimself. She had beaten him again. The German suddenly disappeared, but\r\nPhilip still sat at other tables. She paid no attention to him.\r\nSuddenly he realised that what he did was a matter of complete\r\nindifference to her; he could go on in that way till doomsday, and it\r\nwould have no effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not finished yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThe day after he sat down in his old seat, and when she came up said\r\ngood-evening as though he had not ignored her for a week. His face was\r\nplacid, but he could not prevent the mad beating of his heart. At that\r\ntime the musical comedy had lately leaped into public favour, and he\r\nwas sure that Mildred would be delighted to go to one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99d dine with me one night\r\nand come to The Belle of New York. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a couple of stalls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe added the last sentence in order to tempt her. He knew that when the\r\ngirls went to the play it was either in the pit, or, if some man took\r\nthem, seldom to more expensive seats than the upper circle. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npale face showed no change of expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI get off early on Thursdays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey made arrangements. Mildred lived with an aunt at Herne Hill. The\r\nplay began at eight so they must dine at seven. She proposed that he\r\nshould meet her in the second-class waiting-room at Victoria Station.\r\nShe showed no pleasure, but accepted the invitation as though she\r\nconferred a favour. Philip was vaguely irritated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip arrived at Victoria Station nearly half an hour before the time\r\nwhich Mildred had appointed, and sat down in the second-class\r\nwaiting-room. He waited and she did not come. He began to grow anxious,\r\nand walked into the station watching the incoming suburban trains; the\r\nhour which she had fixed passed, and still there was no sign of her.\r\nPhilip was impatient. He went into the other waiting-rooms and looked\r\nat the people sitting in them. Suddenly his heart gave a great thud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are. I thought you were never coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that after keeping me waiting all this time. I had half a mind\r\nto go back home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said you\xe2\x80\x99d come to the second-class waiting-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say any such thing. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly likely I\xe2\x80\x99d sit in the\r\nsecond-class room when I could sit in the first is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough Philip was sure he had not made a mistake, he said nothing, and\r\nthey got into a cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we dining?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of the Adelphi Restaurant. Will that suit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind where we dine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke ungraciously. She was put out by being kept waiting and\r\nanswered Philip\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at conversation with monosyllables. She wore\r\na long cloak of some rough, dark material and a crochet shawl over her\r\nhead. They reached the restaurant and sat down at a table. She looked\r\nround with satisfaction. The red shades to the candles on the tables,\r\nthe gold of the decorations, the looking-glasses, lent the room a\r\nsumptuous air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been here before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave Philip a smile. She had taken off her cloak; and he saw that\r\nshe wore a pale blue dress, cut square at the neck; and her hair was\r\nmore elaborately arranged than ever. He had ordered champagne and when\r\nit came her eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered fiz?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked carelessly, as though he never\r\ndrank anything else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI WAS surprised when you asked me to do a theatre with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nConversation did not go very easily, for she did not seem to have much\r\nto say; and Philip was nervously conscious that he was not amusing her.\r\nShe listened carelessly to his remarks, with her eyes on other diners,\r\nand made no pretence that she was interested in him. He made one or two\r\nlittle jokes, but she took them quite seriously. The only sign of\r\nvivacity he got was when he spoke of the other girls in the shop; she\r\ncould not bear the manageress and told him all her misdeeds at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stick her at any price and all the air she gives herself.\r\nSometimes I\xe2\x80\x99ve got more than half a mind to tell her something she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t think I know anything about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I happen to know that she\xe2\x80\x99s not above going to Eastbourne with a\r\nman for the week-end now and again. One of the girls has a married\r\nsister who goes there with her husband, and she\xe2\x80\x99s seen her. She was\r\nstaying at the same boarding-house, and she \xe2\x80\x99ad a wedding-ring on, and\r\nI know for one she\xe2\x80\x99s not married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip filled her glass, hoping that champagne would make her more\r\naffable; he was anxious that his little jaunt should be a success. He\r\nnoticed that she held her knife as though it were a pen-holder, and\r\nwhen she drank protruded her little finger. He started several topics\r\nof conversation, but he could get little out of her, and he remembered\r\nwith irritation that he had seen her talking nineteen to the dozen and\r\nlaughing with the German. They finished dinner and went to the play.\r\nPhilip was a very cultured young man, and he looked upon musical comedy\r\nwith scorn. He thought the jokes vulgar and the melodies obvious; it\r\nseemed to him that they did these things much better in France; but\r\nMildred enjoyed herself thoroughly; she laughed till her sides ached,\r\nlooking at Philip now and then when something tickled her to exchange a\r\nglance of pleasure; and she applauded rapturously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the seventh time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after the first act,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I come seven times more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was much interested in the women who surrounded them in the stalls.\r\nShe pointed out to Philip those who were painted and those who wore\r\nfalse hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is horrible, these West-end people,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nthey can do it.\xe2\x80\x9d She put her hand to her hair. \xe2\x80\x9cMine\xe2\x80\x99s all my own,\r\nevery bit of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe found no one to admire, and whenever she spoke of anyone it was to\r\nsay something disagreeable. It made Philip uneasy. He supposed that\r\nnext day she would tell the girls in the shop that he had taken her out\r\nand that he had bored her to death. He disliked her, and yet, he knew\r\nnot why, he wanted to be with her. On the way home he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come out with me again one evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could never get beyond such expressions as that. Her indifference\r\nmaddened him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t much care if you came or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take me out some other fellow will. I need never want\r\nfor men who\xe2\x80\x99ll take me to the theatre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent. They came to the station, and he went to the\r\nbooking-office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my season,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d take you home as it\xe2\x80\x99s rather late, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if it gives you any pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a single first for her and a return for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re not mean, I will say that for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when he\r\nopened the carriage-door.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not know whether he was pleased or sorry when other people\r\nentered and it was impossible to speak. They got out at Herne Hill, and\r\nhe accompanied her to the corner of the road in which she lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say good-night to you here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, holding out her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better not come up to the door. I know what people are, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to have anybody talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said good-night and walked quickly away. He could see the white\r\nshawl in the darkness. He thought she might turn round, but she did\r\nnot. Philip saw which house she went into, and in a moment he walked\r\nalong to look at it. It was a trim, common little house of yellow\r\nbrick, exactly like all the other little houses in the street. He stood\r\noutside for a few minutes, and presently the window on the top floor\r\nwas darkened. Philip strolled slowly back to the station. The evening\r\nhad been unsatisfactory. He felt irritated, restless, and miserable.\r\n\r\nWhen he lay in bed he seemed still to see her sitting in the corner of\r\nthe railway carriage, with the white crochet shawl over her head. He\r\ndid not know how he was to get through the hours that must pass before\r\nhis eyes rested on her again. He thought drowsily of her thin face,\r\nwith its delicate features, and the greenish pallor of her skin. He was\r\nnot happy with her, but he was unhappy away from her. He wanted to sit\r\nby her side and look at her, he wanted to touch her, he wanted\xe2\x80\xa6 the\r\nthought came to him and he did not finish it, suddenly he grew wide\r\nawake\xe2\x80\xa6 he wanted to kiss the thin, pale mouth with its narrow lips. The\r\ntruth came to him at last. He was in love with her. It was incredible.\r\n\r\nHe had often thought of falling in love, and there was one scene which\r\nhe had pictured to himself over and over again. He saw himself coming\r\ninto a ball-room; his eyes fell on a little group of men and women\r\ntalking; and one of the women turned round. Her eyes fell upon him, and\r\nhe knew that the gasp in his throat was in her throat too. He stood\r\nquite still. She was tall and dark and beautiful with eyes like the\r\nnight; she was dressed in white, and in her black hair shone diamonds;\r\nthey stared at one another, forgetting that people surrounded them. He\r\nwent straight up to her, and she moved a little towards him. Both felt\r\nthat the formality of introduction was out of place. He spoke to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for you all my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come at last,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you dance with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe surrendered herself to his outstretched hands and they danced.\r\n(Philip always pretended that he was not lame.) She danced divinely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never danced with anyone who danced like you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe tore up her programme, and they danced together the whole evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so thankful that I waited for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that\r\nin the end I must meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeople in the ball-room stared. They did not care. They did not wish to\r\nhide their passion. At last they went into the garden. He flung a light\r\ncloak over her shoulders and put her in a waiting cab. They caught the\r\nmidnight train to Paris; and they sped through the silent, star-lit\r\nnight into the unknown.\r\n\r\nHe thought of this old fancy of his, and it seemed impossible that he\r\nshould be in love with Mildred Rogers. Her name was grotesque. He did\r\nnot think her pretty; he hated the thinness of her, only that evening\r\nhe had noticed how the bones of her chest stood out in evening-dress;\r\nhe went over her features one by one; he did not like her mouth, and\r\nthe unhealthiness of her colour vaguely repelled him. She was common.\r\nHer phrases, so bald and few, constantly repeated, showed the emptiness\r\nof her mind; he recalled her vulgar little laugh at the jokes of the\r\nmusical comedy; and he remembered the little finger carefully extended\r\nwhen she held her glass to her mouth; her manners like her\r\nconversation, were odiously genteel. He remembered her insolence;\r\nsometimes he had felt inclined to box her ears; and suddenly, he knew\r\nnot why, perhaps it was the thought of hitting her or the recollection\r\nof her tiny, beautiful ears, he was seized by an uprush of emotion. He\r\nyearned for her. He thought of taking her in his arms, the thin,\r\nfragile body, and kissing her pale mouth: he wanted to pass his fingers\r\ndown the slightly greenish cheeks. He wanted her.\r\n\r\nHe had thought of love as a rapture which seized one so that all the\r\nworld seemed spring-like, he had looked forward to an ecstatic\r\nhappiness; but this was not happiness; it was a hunger of the soul, it\r\nwas a painful yearning, it was a bitter anguish, he had never known\r\nbefore. He tried to think when it had first come to him. He did not\r\nknow. He only remembered that each time he had gone into the shop,\r\nafter the first two or three times, it had been with a little feeling\r\nin the heart that was pain; and he remembered that when she spoke to\r\nhim he felt curiously breathless. When she left him it was\r\nwretchedness, and when she came to him again it was despair.\r\n\r\nHe stretched himself in his bed as a dog stretches himself. He wondered\r\nhow he was going to endure that ceaseless aching of his soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip woke early next morning, and his first thought was of Mildred.\r\nIt struck him that he might meet her at Victoria Station and walk with\r\nher to the shop. He shaved quickly, scrambled into his clothes, and\r\ntook a bus to the station. He was there by twenty to eight and watched\r\nthe incoming trains. Crowds poured out of them, clerks and shop-people\r\nat that early hour, and thronged up the platform: they hurried along,\r\nsometimes in pairs, here and there a group of girls, but more often\r\nalone. They were white, most of them, ugly in the early morning, and\r\nthey had an abstracted look; the younger ones walked lightly, as though\r\nthe cement of the platform were pleasant to tread, but the others went\r\nas though impelled by a machine: their faces were set in an anxious\r\nfrown.\r\n\r\nAt last Philip saw Mildred, and he went up to her eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come and see how you were after\r\nlast night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wore an old brown ulster and a sailor hat. It was very clear that\r\nshe was not pleased to see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m all right. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got much time to waste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mind if I walk down Victoria Street with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m none too early. I shall have to walk fast,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, looking\r\ndown at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s club-foot.\r\n\r\nHe turned scarlet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. I won\xe2\x80\x99t detain you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can please yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on, and he with a sinking heart made his way home to\r\nbreakfast. He hated her. He knew he was a fool to bother about her; she\r\nwas not the sort of woman who would ever care two straws for him, and\r\nshe must look upon his deformity with distaste. He made up his mind\r\nthat he would not go in to tea that afternoon, but, hating himself, he\r\nwent. She nodded to him as he came in and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect I was rather short with you this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect you, and it came like a surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt that a great weight had suddenly been lifted from him. He was\r\ninfinitely grateful for one word of kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s wanting you just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, but could think of nothing to say; he racked his\r\nbrains anxiously, seeking for a remark which should keep her by him; he\r\nwanted to tell her how much she meant to him; but he did not know how\r\nto make love now that he loved in earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your friend with the fair moustache? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him\r\nlately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone back to Birmingham. He\xe2\x80\x99s in business there. He only\r\ncomes up to London every now and again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in love with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better ask him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot to do with you if he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA bitter answer leaped to his tongue, but he was learning\r\nself-restraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why you say things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d was all he permitted himself\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with those indifferent eyes of hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t set much store on me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo reason at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reached over for his paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quick-tempered,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when she saw the gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do\r\ntake offence easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled and looked at her appealingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you do something for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me walk back to the station with you tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out after tea and went back to his rooms, but at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nwhen the shop closed, he was waiting outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a caution,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when she came out. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought it was very difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid any of the girls see you waiting for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey all laugh at you, you know. They say you\xe2\x80\x99re spoony on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch you care,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, quarrelsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the station he took a ticket and said he was going to accompany her\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have much to do with your time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I can waste it in my own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey seemed to be always on the verge of a quarrel. The fact was that\r\nhe hated himself for loving her. She seemed to be constantly\r\nhumiliating him, and for each snub that he endured he owed her a\r\ngrudge. But she was in a friendly mood that evening, and talkative: she\r\ntold him that her parents were dead; she gave him to understand that\r\nshe did not have to earn her living, but worked for amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like my going to business. I can have the best of\r\neverything at home. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to think I work because I need\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d Philip knew that she was not speaking the truth. The gentility of\r\nher class made her use this pretence to avoid the stigma attached to\r\nearning her living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy family\xe2\x80\x99s very well-connected,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled faintly, and she noticed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntelling you the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him suspiciously, but in a moment could not resist the\r\ntemptation to impress him with the splendour of her early days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father always kept a dog-cart, and we had three servants. We had a\r\ncook and a housemaid and an odd man. We used to grow beautiful roses.\r\nPeople used to stop at the gate and ask who the house belonged to, the\r\nroses were so beautiful. Of course it isn\xe2\x80\x99t very nice for me having to\r\nmix with them girls in the shop, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the class of person I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nused to, and sometimes I really think I\xe2\x80\x99ll give up business on that\r\naccount. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the work I mind, don\xe2\x80\x99t think that; but it\xe2\x80\x99s the class\r\nof people I have to mix with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were sitting opposite one another in the train, and Philip,\r\nlistening sympathetically to what she said, was quite happy. He was\r\namused at her naivete and slightly touched. There was a very faint\r\ncolour in her cheeks. He was thinking that it would be delightful to\r\nkiss the tip of her chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moment you come into the shop I saw you was a gentleman in every\r\nsense of the word. Was your father a professional man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can always tell a professional man. There\xe2\x80\x99s something about them,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is, but I know at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked along from the station together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I want you to come and see another play with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might go so far as to say you\xe2\x80\x99d like to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Let\xe2\x80\x99s fix a day. Would Saturday night suit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey made further arrangements, and then found themselves at the corner\r\nof the road in which she lived. She gave him her hand, and he held it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I do so awfully want to call you Mildred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may if you like, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll call me Philip, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will if I can think of it. It seems more natural to call you Mr.\r\nCarey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew her slightly towards him, but she leaned back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you kiss me good-night?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpudence!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe snatched away her hand and hurried towards her house.\r\n\r\nPhilip bought tickets for Saturday night. It was not one of the days on\r\nwhich she got off early and therefore she would have no time to go home\r\nand change; but she meant to bring a frock up with her in the morning\r\nand hurry into her clothes at the shop. If the manageress was in a good\r\ntemper she would let her go at seven. Philip had agreed to wait outside\r\nfrom a quarter past seven onwards. He looked forward to the occasion\r\nwith painful eagerness, for in the cab on the way from the theatre to\r\nthe station he thought she would let him kiss her. The vehicle gave\r\nevery facility for a man to put his arm round a girl\xe2\x80\x99s waist (an\r\nadvantage which the hansom had over the taxi of the present day), and\r\nthe delight of that was worth the cost of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment.\r\n\r\nBut on Saturday afternoon when he went in to have tea, in order to\r\nconfirm the arrangements, he met the man with the fair moustache coming\r\nout of the shop. He knew by now that he was called Miller. He was a\r\nnaturalized German, who had anglicised his name, and he had lived many\r\nyears in England. Philip had heard him speak, and, though his English\r\nwas fluent and natural, it had not quite the intonation of the native.\r\nPhilip knew that he was flirting with Mildred, and he was horribly\r\njealous of him; but he took comfort in the coldness of her temperament,\r\nwhich otherwise distressed him; and, thinking her incapable of passion,\r\nhe looked upon his rival as no better off than himself. But his heart\r\nsank now, for his first thought was that Miller\xe2\x80\x99s sudden appearance\r\nmight interfere with the jaunt which he had so looked forward to. He\r\nentered, sick with apprehension. The waitress came up to him, took his\r\norder for tea, and presently brought it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with an expression on her face of real\r\ndistress. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able to come tonight after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look so stern about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault. My\r\naunt was taken ill last night, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the girl\xe2\x80\x99s night out so I must\r\ngo and sit with her. She can\xe2\x80\x99t be left alone, can she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you home instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the tickets. It would be a pity to waste them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took them out of his pocket and deliberately tore them up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing that for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I want to go and see a rotten musical comedy by\r\nmyself, do you? I only took seats there for your sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t see me home if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made other arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by that. You\xe2\x80\x99re just as selfish as all the\r\nrest of them. You only think of yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault if my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s queer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe quickly wrote out his bill and left him. Philip knew very little\r\nabout women, or he would have been aware that one should accept their\r\nmost transparent lies. He made up his mind that he would watch the shop\r\nand see for certain whether Mildred went out with the German. He had an\r\nunhappy passion for certainty. At seven he stationed himself on the\r\nopposite pavement. He looked about for Miller, but did not see him. In\r\nten minutes she came out, she had on the cloak and shawl which she had\r\nworn when he took her to the Shaftesbury Theatre. It was obvious that\r\nshe was not going home. She saw him before he had time to move away,\r\nstarted a little, and then came straight up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaking the air,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re spying on me, you dirty little cad. I thought you was a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you think a gentleman would be likely to take any interest in\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nThere was a devil within him which forced him to make matters worse. He\r\nwanted to hurt her as much as she was hurting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I can change my mind if I like. I\xe2\x80\x99m not obliged to come out\r\nwith you. I tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m going home, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be followed or spied\r\nupon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Miller today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no business of yours. In point of fact I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, so you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwrong again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him this afternoon. He\xe2\x80\x99d just come out of the shop when I went\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what if he did? I can go out with him if I want to, can\xe2\x80\x99t I? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s keeping you waiting, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather wait for him than have you wait for me. Put that in\r\nyour pipe and smoke it. And now p\xe2\x80\x99raps you\xe2\x80\x99ll go off home and mind your\r\nown business in future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mood changed suddenly from anger to despair, and his voice trembled\r\nwhen he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, don\xe2\x80\x99t be beastly with me, Mildred. You know I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully fond of\r\nyou. I think I love you with all my heart. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you change your mind?\r\nI was looking forward to this evening so awfully. You see, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t care twopence about you really. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you dine with\r\nme? I\xe2\x80\x99ll get some more tickets, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go anywhere you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I won\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s no good you talking. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind,\r\nand when I make up my mind I keep to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment. His heart was torn with anguish. People\r\nwere hurrying past them on the pavement, and cabs and omnibuses rolled\r\nby noisily. He saw that Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were wandering. She was afraid\r\nof missing Miller in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too degrading. If I go\r\nnow I go for good. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99ll come with me tonight you\xe2\x80\x99ll never see\r\nme again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to think that\xe2\x80\x99ll be an awful thing for me. All I say is, good\r\nriddance to bad rubbish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded and limped away slowly, for he hoped with all his heart that\r\nshe would call him back. At the next lamp-post he stopped and looked\r\nover his shoulder. He thought she might beckon to him\xe2\x80\x94he was willing to\r\nforget everything, he was ready for any humiliation\xe2\x80\x94but she had turned\r\naway, and apparently had ceased to trouble about him. He realised that\r\nshe was glad to be quit of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip passed the evening wretchedly. He had told his landlady that he\r\nwould not be in, so there was nothing for him to eat, and he had to go\r\nto Gatti\xe2\x80\x99s for dinner. Afterwards he went back to his rooms, but\r\nGriffiths on the floor above him was having a party, and the noisy\r\nmerriment made his own misery more hard to bear. He went to a\r\nmusic-hall, but it was Saturday night and there was standing-room only:\r\nafter half an hour of boredom his legs grew tired and he went home. He\r\ntried to read, but he could not fix his attention; and yet it was\r\nnecessary that he should work hard. His examination in biology was in\r\nlittle more than a fortnight, and, though it was easy, he had neglected\r\nhis lectures of late and was conscious that he knew nothing. It was\r\nonly a viva, however, and he felt sure that in a fortnight he could\r\nfind out enough about the subject to scrape through. He had confidence\r\nin his intelligence. He threw aside his book and gave himself up to\r\nthinking deliberately of the matter which was in his mind all the time.\r\n\r\nHe reproached himself bitterly for his behaviour that evening. Why had\r\nhe given her the alternative that she must dine with him or else never\r\nsee him again? Of course she refused. He should have allowed for her\r\npride. He had burnt his ships behind him. It would not be so hard to\r\nbear if he thought that she was suffering now, but he knew her too\r\nwell: she was perfectly indifferent to him. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a fool he\r\nwould have pretended to believe her story; he ought to have had the\r\nstrength to conceal his disappointment and the self-control to master\r\nhis temper. He could not tell why he loved her. He had read of the\r\nidealisation that takes place in love, but he saw her exactly as she\r\nwas. She was not amusing or clever, her mind was common; she had a\r\nvulgar shrewdness which revolted him, she had no gentleness nor\r\nsoftness. As she would have put it herself, she was on the make. What\r\naroused her admiration was a clever trick played on an unsuspecting\r\nperson; to \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99 somebody always gave her satisfaction. Philip laughed\r\nsavagely as he thought of her gentility and the refinement with which\r\nshe ate her food; she could not bear a coarse word, so far as her\r\nlimited vocabulary reached she had a passion for euphemisms, and she\r\nscented indecency everywhere; she never spoke of trousers but referred\r\nto them as nether garments; she thought it slightly indelicate to blow\r\nher nose and did it in a deprecating way. She was dreadfully anaemic\r\nand suffered from the dyspepsia which accompanies that ailing. Philip\r\nwas repelled by her flat breast and narrow hips, and he hated the\r\nvulgar way in which she did her hair. He loathed and despised himself\r\nfor loving her.\r\n\r\nThe fact remained that he was helpless. He felt just as he had felt\r\nsometimes in the hands of a bigger boy at school. He had struggled\r\nagainst the superior strength till his own strength was gone, and he\r\nwas rendered quite powerless\xe2\x80\x94he remembered the peculiar languor he had\r\nfelt in his limbs, almost as though he were paralysed\xe2\x80\x94so that he could\r\nnot help himself at all. He might have been dead. He felt just that\r\nsame weakness now. He loved the woman so that he knew he had never\r\nloved before. He did not mind her faults of person or of character, he\r\nthought he loved them too: at all events they meant nothing to him. It\r\ndid not seem himself that was concerned; he felt that he had been\r\nseized by some strange force that moved him against his will, contrary\r\nto his interests; and because he had a passion for freedom he hated the\r\nchains which bound him. He laughed at himself when he thought how often\r\nhe had longed to experience the overwhelming passion. He cursed himself\r\nbecause he had given way to it. He thought of the beginnings; nothing\r\nof all this would have happened if he had not gone into the shop with\r\nDunsford. The whole thing was his own fault. Except for his ridiculous\r\nvanity he would never have troubled himself with the ill-mannered slut.\r\n\r\nAt all events the occurrences of that evening had finished the whole\r\naffair. Unless he was lost to all sense of shame he could not go back.\r\nHe wanted passionately to get rid of the love that obsessed him; it was\r\ndegrading and hateful. He must prevent himself from thinking of her. In\r\na little while the anguish he suffered must grow less. His mind went\r\nback to the past. He wondered whether Emily Wilkinson and Fanny Price\r\nhad endured on his account anything like the torment that he suffered\r\nnow. He felt a pang of remorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then what it was like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\nHe slept very badly. The next day was Sunday, and he worked at his\r\nbiology. He sat with the book in front of him, forming the words with\r\nhis lips in order to fix his attention, but he could remember nothing.\r\nHe found his thoughts going back to Mildred every minute, and he\r\nrepeated to himself the exact words of the quarrel they had had. He had\r\nto force himself back to his book. He went out for a walk. The streets\r\non the South side of the river were dingy enough on week-days, but\r\nthere was an energy, a coming and going, which gave them a sordid\r\nvivacity; but on Sundays, with no shops open, no carts in the roadway,\r\nsilent and depressed, they were indescribably dreary. Philip thought\r\nthat day would never end. But he was so tired that he slept heavily,\r\nand when Monday came he entered upon life with determination. Christmas\r\nwas approaching, and a good many of the students had gone into the\r\ncountry for the short holiday between the two parts of the winter\r\nsession; but Philip had refused his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to go down to\r\nBlackstable. He had given the approaching examination as his excuse,\r\nbut in point of fact he had been unwilling to leave London and Mildred.\r\nHe had neglected his work so much that now he had only a fortnight to\r\nlearn what the curriculum allowed three months for. He set to work\r\nseriously. He found it easier each day not to think of Mildred. He\r\ncongratulated himself on his force of character. The pain he suffered\r\nwas no longer anguish, but a sort of soreness, like what one might be\r\nexpected to feel if one had been thrown off a horse and, though no\r\nbones were broken, were bruised all over and shaken. Philip found that\r\nhe was able to observe with curiosity the condition he had been in\r\nduring the last few weeks. He analysed his feelings with interest. He\r\nwas a little amused at himself. One thing that struck him was how\r\nlittle under those circumstances it mattered what one thought; the\r\nsystem of personal philosophy, which had given him great satisfaction\r\nto devise, had not served him. He was puzzled by this.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes in the street he would see a girl who looked so like\r\nMildred that his heart seemed to stop beating. Then he could not help\r\nhimself, he hurried on to catch her up, eager and anxious, only to find\r\nthat it was a total stranger. Men came back from the country, and he\r\nwent with Dunsford to have tea at an A. B. C. shop. The well-known\r\nuniform made him so miserable that he could not speak. The thought came\r\nto him that perhaps she had been transferred to another establishment\r\nof the firm for which she worked, and he might suddenly find himself\r\nface to face with her. The idea filled him with panic, so that he\r\nfeared Dunsford would see that something was the matter with him: he\r\ncould not think of anything to say; he pretended to listen to what\r\nDunsford was talking about; the conversation maddened him; and it was\r\nall he could do to prevent himself from crying out to Dunsford for\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake to hold his tongue.\r\n\r\nThen came the day of his examination. Philip, when his turn arrived,\r\nwent forward to the examiner\xe2\x80\x99s table with the utmost confidence. He\r\nanswered three or four questions. Then they showed him various\r\nspecimens; he had been to very few lectures and, as soon as he was\r\nasked about things which he could not learn from books, he was floored.\r\nHe did what he could to hide his ignorance, the examiner did not\r\ninsist, and soon his ten minutes were over. He felt certain he had\r\npassed; but next day, when he went up to the examination buildings to\r\nsee the result posted on the door, he was astounded not to find his\r\nnumber among those who had satisfied the examiners. In amazement he\r\nread the list three times. Dunsford was with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re ploughed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe had just inquired Philip\xe2\x80\x99s number. Philip turned and saw by his\r\nradiant face that Dunsford had passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m jolly glad you\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nright. I shall go up again in July.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very anxious to pretend he did not mind, and on their way back\r\nalong The Embankment insisted on talking of indifferent things.\r\nDunsford good-naturedly wanted to discuss the causes of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfailure, but Philip was obstinately casual. He was horribly mortified;\r\nand the fact that Dunsford, whom he looked upon as a very pleasant but\r\nquite stupid fellow, had passed made his own rebuff harder to bear. He\r\nhad always been proud of his intelligence, and now he asked himself\r\ndesperately whether he was not mistaken in the opinion he held of\r\nhimself. In the three months of the winter session the students who had\r\njoined in October had already shaken down into groups, and it was clear\r\nwhich were brilliant, which were clever or industrious, and which were\r\n\xe2\x80\x98rotters.\xe2\x80\x99 Philip was conscious that his failure was a surprise to no\r\none but himself. It was tea-time, and he knew that a lot of men would\r\nbe having tea in the basement of the Medical School: those who had\r\npassed the examination would be exultant, those who disliked him would\r\nlook at him with satisfaction, and the poor devils who had failed would\r\nsympathise with him in order to receive sympathy. His instinct was not\r\nto go near the hospital for a week, when the affair would be no more\r\nthought of, but, because he hated so much to go just then, he went: he\r\nwanted to inflict suffering upon himself. He forgot for the moment his\r\nmaxim of life to follow his inclinations with due regard for the\r\npoliceman round the corner; or, if he acted in accordance with it,\r\nthere must have been some strange morbidity in his nature which made\r\nhim take a grim pleasure in self-torture.\r\n\r\nBut later on, when he had endured the ordeal to which he forced\r\nhimself, going out into the night after the noisy conversation in the\r\nsmoking-room, he was seized with a feeling of utter loneliness. He\r\nseemed to himself absurd and futile. He had an urgent need of\r\nconsolation, and the temptation to see Mildred was irresistible. He\r\nthought bitterly that there was small chance of consolation from her;\r\nbut he wanted to see her even if he did not speak to her; after all,\r\nshe was a waitress and would be obliged to serve him. She was the only\r\nperson in the world he cared for. There was no use in hiding that fact\r\nfrom himself. Of course it would be humiliating to go back to the shop\r\nas though nothing had happened, but he had not much self-respect left.\r\nThough he would not confess it to himself, he had hoped each day that\r\nshe would write to him; she knew that a letter addressed to the\r\nhospital would find him; but she had not written: it was evident that\r\nshe cared nothing if she saw him again or not. And he kept on repeating\r\nto himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see her. I must see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe desire was so great that he could not give the time necessary to\r\nwalk, but jumped in a cab. He was too thrifty to use one when it could\r\npossibly be avoided. He stood outside the shop for a minute or two. The\r\nthought came to him that perhaps she had left, and in terror he walked\r\nin quickly. He saw her at once. He sat down and she came up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cup of tea and a muffin, please,\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered.\r\n\r\nHe could hardly speak. He was afraid for a moment that he was going to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost thought you was dead,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe was smiling. Smiling! She seemed to have forgotten completely that\r\nlast scene which Philip had repeated to himself a hundred times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought if you\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to see me you\xe2\x80\x99d write,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got too much to do to think about writing letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible for her to say a gracious thing. Philip cursed the\r\nfate which chained him to such a woman. She went away to fetch his tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to sit down for a minute or two?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when she\r\nbrought it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d gone away for the holidays. Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been in\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at her with haggard, passionate eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember that I said I\xe2\x80\x99d never see you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing now then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed anxious to make him drink up the cup of his humiliation; but\r\nhe knew her well enough to know that she spoke at random; she hurt him\r\nfrightfully, and never even tried to. He did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a nasty trick you played on me, spying on me like that. I\r\nalways thought you was a gentleman in every sense of the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be beastly to me, Mildred. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a funny feller. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. I\xe2\x80\x99m such a blasted fool as to love you with all my\r\nheart and soul, and I know that you don\xe2\x80\x99t care twopence for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had been a gentleman I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have come next day and\r\nbegged my pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had no mercy. He looked at her neck and thought how he would like\r\nto jab it with the knife he had for his muffin. He knew enough anatomy\r\nto make pretty certain of getting the carotid artery. And at the same\r\ntime he wanted to cover her pale, thin face with kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only make you understand how frightfully I\xe2\x80\x99m in love with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t begged my pardon yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grew very white. She felt that she had done nothing wrong on that\r\noccasion. She wanted him now to humble himself. He was very proud. For\r\none instant he felt inclined to tell her to go to hell, but he dared\r\nnot. His passion made him abject. He was willing to submit to anything\r\nrather than not see her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, Mildred. I beg your pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had to force the words out. It was a horrible effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you that I wish I had come\r\nout with you that evening. I thought Miller was a gentleman, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndiscovered my mistake now. I soon sent him about his business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip gave a little gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMildred, won\xe2\x80\x99t you come out with me tonight? Let\xe2\x80\x99s go and dine\r\nsomewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. My aunt\xe2\x80\x99ll be expecting me home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send her a wire. You can say you\xe2\x80\x99ve been detained in the shop;\r\nshe won\xe2\x80\x99t know any better. Oh, do come, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen\r\nyou for so long, and I want to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked down at her clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about that. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go somewhere where it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re dressed. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to a music-hall afterwards. Please say\r\nyes. It would give me so much pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment; he looked at her with pitifully appealing eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I do. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been out anywhere since I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was with the greatest difficulty he could prevent himself from\r\nseizing her hand there and then to cover it with kisses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX\r\n\r\n\r\nThey dined in Soho. Philip was tremulous with joy. It was not one of\r\nthe more crowded of those cheap restaurants where the respectable and\r\nneedy dine in the belief that it is bohemian and the assurance that it\r\nis economical. It was a humble establishment, kept by a good man from\r\nRouen and his wife, that Philip had discovered by accident. He had been\r\nattracted by the Gallic look of the window, in which was generally an\r\nuncooked steak on one plate and on each side two dishes of raw\r\nvegetables. There was one seedy French waiter, who was attempting to\r\nlearn English in a house where he never heard anything but French; and\r\nthe customers were a few ladies of easy virtue, a menage or two, who\r\nhad their own napkins reserved for them, and a few queer men who came\r\nin for hurried, scanty meals.\r\n\r\nHere Mildred and Philip were able to get a table to themselves. Philip\r\nsent the waiter for a bottle of Burgundy from the neighbouring tavern,\r\nand they had a potage aux herbes, a steak from the window aux pommes,\r\nand an omelette au kirsch. There was really an air of romance in the\r\nmeal and in the place. Mildred, at first a little reserved in her\r\nappreciation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI never quite trust these foreign places, you never know\r\nwhat there is in these messed up dishes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was insensibly moved by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like this place, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou feel you can put your\r\nelbows on the table, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tall fellow came in, with a mane of gray hair and a ragged thin\r\nbeard. He wore a dilapidated cloak and a wide-awake hat. He nodded to\r\nPhilip, who had met him there before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks like an anarchist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, one of the most dangerous in Europe. He\xe2\x80\x99s been in every prison\r\non the Continent and has assassinated more persons than any gentleman\r\nunhung. He always goes about with a bomb in his pocket, and of course\r\nit makes conversation a little difficult because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree\r\nwith him he lays it on the table in a marked manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at the man with horror and surprise, and then glanced\r\nsuspiciously at Philip. She saw that his eyes were laughing. She\r\nfrowned a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a little shout of joy. He was so happy. But Mildred didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nbeing laughed at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything funny in telling lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, which was lying on the table, and pressed it gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are lovely, and I could kiss the ground you walk on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe greenish pallor of her skin intoxicated him, and her thin white\r\nlips had an extraordinary fascination. Her anaemia made her rather\r\nshort of breath, and she held her mouth slightly open. It seemed to add\r\nsomehow to the attractiveness of her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do like me a bit, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t I suppose I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here, should I? You\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ngentleman in every sense of the word, I will say that for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had finished their dinner and were drinking coffee. Philip,\r\nthrowing economy to the winds, smoked a three-penny cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what a pleasure it is to me just to sit opposite and\r\nlook at you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve yearned for you. I was sick for a sight of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred smiled a little and faintly flushed. She was not then suffering\r\nfrom the dyspepsia which generally attacked her immediately after a\r\nmeal. She felt more kindly disposed to Philip than ever before, and the\r\nunaccustomed tenderness in her eyes filled him with joy. He knew\r\ninstinctively that it was madness to give himself into her hands; his\r\nonly chance was to treat her casually and never allow her to see the\r\nuntamed passions that seethed in his breast; she would only take\r\nadvantage of his weakness; but he could not be prudent now: he told her\r\nall the agony he had endured during the separation from her; he told\r\nher of his struggles with himself, how he had tried to get over his\r\npassion, thought he had succeeded, and how he found out that it was as\r\nstrong as ever. He knew that he had never really wanted to get over it.\r\nHe loved her so much that he did not mind suffering. He bared his heart\r\nto her. He showed her proudly all his weakness.\r\n\r\nNothing would have pleased him more than to sit on in the cosy, shabby\r\nrestaurant, but he knew that Mildred wanted entertainment. She was\r\nrestless and, wherever she was, wanted after a while to go somewhere\r\nelse. He dared not bore her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, how about going to a music-hall?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe thought rapidly that if she cared for him at all she would say she\r\npreferred to stay there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just thinking we ought to be going if we are going,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip waited impatiently for the end of the performance. He had made\r\nup his mind exactly what to do, and when they got into the cab he\r\npassed his arm, as though almost by accident, round her waist. But he\r\ndrew it back quickly with a little cry. He had pricked himself. She\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, that comes of putting your arm where it\xe2\x80\x99s got no business to\r\nbe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI always know when men try and put their arm round my\r\nwaist. That pin always catches them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be more careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round again. She made no objection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed blissfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as you\xe2\x80\x99re happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted.\r\n\r\nThey drove down St. James\xe2\x80\x99 Street into the Park, and Philip quickly\r\nkissed her. He was strangely afraid of her, and it required all his\r\ncourage. She turned her lips to him without speaking. She neither\r\nseemed to mind nor to like it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you only knew how long I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nHe tried to kiss her again, but she turned her head away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nOn the chance of kissing her a second time he travelled down to Herne\r\nHill with her, and at the end of the road in which she lived he asked\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you give me another kiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him indifferently and then glanced up the road to see\r\nthat no one was in sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized her in his arms and kissed her passionately, but she pushed\r\nhim away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind my hat, silly. You are clumsy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHe saw her then every day. He began going to lunch at the shop, but\r\nMildred stopped him: she said it made the girls talk; so he had to\r\ncontent himself with tea; but he always waited about to walk with her\r\nto the station; and once or twice a week they dined together. He gave\r\nher little presents, a gold bangle, gloves, handkerchiefs, and the\r\nlike. He was spending more than he could afford, but he could not help\r\nit: it was only when he gave her anything that she showed any\r\naffection. She knew the price of everything, and her gratitude was in\r\nexact proportion with the value of his gift. He did not care. He was\r\ntoo happy when she volunteered to kiss him to mind by what means he got\r\nher demonstrativeness. He discovered that she found Sundays at home\r\ntedious, so he went down to Herne Hill in the morning, met her at the\r\nend of the road, and went to church with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always like to go to church once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks well, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she went back to dinner, he got a scrappy meal at a hotel, and in\r\nthe afternoon they took a walk in Brockwell Park. They had nothing much\r\nto say to one another, and Philip, desperately afraid she was bored\r\n(she was very easily bored), racked his brain for topics of\r\nconversation. He realised that these walks amused neither of them, but\r\nhe could not bear to leave her, and did all he could to lengthen them\r\ntill she became tired and out of temper. He knew that she did not care\r\nfor him, and he tried to force a love which his reason told him was not\r\nin her nature: she was cold. He had no claim on her, but he could not\r\nhelp being exacting. Now that they were more intimate he found it less\r\neasy to control his temper; he was often irritable and could not help\r\nsaying bitter things. Often they quarrelled, and she would not speak to\r\nhim for a while; but this always reduced him to subjection, and he\r\ncrawled before her. He was angry with himself for showing so little\r\ndignity. He grew furiously jealous if he saw her speaking to any other\r\nman in the shop, and when he was jealous he seemed to be beside\r\nhimself. He would deliberately insult her, leave the shop and spend\r\nafterwards a sleepless night tossing on his bed, by turns angry and\r\nremorseful. Next day he would go to the shop and appeal for\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so awfully fond of you that I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of these days you\xe2\x80\x99ll go too far,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nHe was anxious to come to her home in order that the greater intimacy\r\nshould give him an advantage over the stray acquaintances she made\r\nduring her working-hours; but she would not let him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt would think it so funny,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe suspected that her refusal was due only to a disinclination to let\r\nhim see her aunt. Mildred had represented her as the widow of a\r\nprofessional man (that was her formula of distinction), and was\r\nuneasily conscious that the good woman could hardly be called\r\ndistinguished. Philip imagined that she was in point of fact the widow\r\nof a small tradesman. He knew that Mildred was a snob. But he found no\r\nmeans by which he could indicate to her that he did not mind how common\r\nthe aunt was.\r\n\r\nTheir worst quarrel took place one evening at dinner when she told him\r\nthat a man had asked her to go to a play with him. Philip turned pale,\r\nand his face grew hard and stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? He\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice gentlemanly fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you anywhere you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same thing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t always go about with you.\r\nBesides he\xe2\x80\x99s asked me to fix my own day, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go one evening\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m not going out with you. It won\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had any sense of decency, if you had any gratitude, you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by gratitude. If you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the\r\nthings you\xe2\x80\x99ve given me you can have them back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice had the shrewish tone it sometimes got.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not very lively, always going about with you. It\xe2\x80\x99s always do you\r\nlove me, do you love me, till I just get about sick of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew it was madness to go on asking her that, but he could not help\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I like you all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she would answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all? I love you with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not that sort, I\xe2\x80\x99m not one to say much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew how happy just one word would make me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what I always say is, people must take me as they find me, and\r\nif they don\xe2\x80\x99t like it they can lump it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut sometimes she expressed herself more plainly still, and, when he\r\nasked the question, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t go on at that again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he became sulky and silent. He hated her.\r\n\r\nAnd now he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, if you feel like that about it I wonder you condescend to\r\ncome out with me at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my seeking, you can be very sure of that, you just force me\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis pride was bitterly hurt, and he answered madly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I\xe2\x80\x99m just good enough to stand you dinners and theatres when\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no one else to do it, and when someone else turns up I can go\r\nto hell. Thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99m about sick of being made a convenience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be talked to like that by anyone. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just show you\r\nhow much I want your dirty dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up, put on her jacket, and walked quickly out of the\r\nrestaurant. Philip sat on. He determined he would not move, but ten\r\nminutes afterwards he jumped in a cab and followed her. He guessed that\r\nshe would take a \xe2\x80\x99bus to Victoria, so that they would arrive about the\r\nsame time. He saw her on the platform, escaped her notice, and went\r\ndown to Herne Hill in the same train. He did not want to speak to her\r\ntill she was on the way home and could not escape him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had turned out of the main street, brightly lit and\r\nnoisy with traffic, he caught her up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMildred,\xe2\x80\x9d he called.\r\n\r\nShe walked on and would neither look at him nor answer. He repeated her\r\nname. Then she stopped and faced him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you want? I saw you hanging about Victoria. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you leave\r\nme alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you make it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of your temper and your jealousy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for you, I\r\nnever have cared for you, and I never shall care for you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto have anything more to do with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked on quickly, and he had to hurry to keep up with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never make allowances for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well to be\r\njolly and amiable when you\xe2\x80\x99re indifferent to anyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re as much in love as I am. Have mercy on me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for me. After all you can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I only want\r\nyou to let me love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked on, refusing to speak, and Philip saw with agony that they\r\nhad only a few hundred yards to go before they reached her house. He\r\nabased himself. He poured out an incoherent story of love and\r\npenitence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll only forgive me this time I promise you you\xe2\x80\x99ll never have to\r\ncomplain of me in future. You can go out with whoever you choose. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe only too glad if you\xe2\x80\x99ll come with me when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing better\r\nto do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped again, for they had reached the corner at which he always\r\nleft her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you can take yourself off. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you coming up to the\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go till you say you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick and tired of the whole thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, for he had an instinct that he could say\r\nsomething that would move her. It made him feel almost sick to utter\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is cruel, I have so much to put up with. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is\r\nto be a cripple. Of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t like me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered quickly, with a sudden break\r\nof pity in her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to act now, and his voice was husky and low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and looked at him, and her own eyes were filled with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise you it never made any difference to me. I never thought\r\nabout it after the first day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kept a gloomy, tragic silence. He wanted her to think he was\r\novercome with emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I like you awfully, Philip. Only you are so trying sometimes.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s make it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put up her lips to his, and with a sigh of relief he kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow are you happy again?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bade him good-night and hurried down the road. Next day he took her\r\nin a little watch with a brooch to pin on her dress. She had been\r\nhankering for it.\r\n\r\nBut three or four days later, when she brought him his tea, Mildred\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember what you promised the other night? You mean to keep that,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew exactly what she meant and was prepared for her next words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m going out with that gentleman I told you about tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had himself now under excellent control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make myself more\r\ndisagreeable than I can help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was excited over the outing and talked about it willingly. Philip\r\nwondered whether she did so in order to pain him or merely because she\r\nwas callous. He was in the habit of condoning her cruelty by the\r\nthought of her stupidity. She had not the brains to see when she was\r\nwounding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not much fun to be in love with a girl who has no imagination and\r\nno sense of humour,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he listened.\r\n\r\nBut the want of these things excused her. He felt that if he had not\r\nrealised this he could never forgive her for the pain she caused him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got seats for the Tivoli,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me my choice and I\r\nchose that. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to dine at the Cafe Royal. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmost expensive place in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman in every sense of the word,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Philip, but he\r\nclenched his teeth to prevent himself from uttering a syllable.\r\n\r\nPhilip went to the Tivoli and saw Mildred with her companion, a\r\nsmooth-faced young man with sleek hair and the spruce look of a\r\ncommercial traveller, sitting in the second row of the stalls. Mildred\r\nwore a black picture hat with ostrich feathers in it, which became her\r\nwell. She was listening to her host with that quiet smile which Philip\r\nknew; she had no vivacity of expression, and it required broad farce to\r\nexcite her laughter; but Philip could see that she was interested and\r\namused. He thought to himself bitterly that her companion, flashy and\r\njovial, exactly suited her. Her sluggish temperament made her\r\nappreciate noisy people. Philip had a passion for discussion, but no\r\ntalent for small-talk. He admired the easy drollery of which some of\r\nhis friends were masters, Lawson for instance, and his sense of\r\ninferiority made him shy and awkward. The things which interested him\r\nbored Mildred. She expected men to talk about football and racing, and\r\nhe knew nothing of either. He did not know the catchwords which only\r\nneed be said to excite a laugh.\r\n\r\nPrinted matter had always been a fetish to Philip, and now, in order to\r\nmake himself more interesting, he read industriously The Sporting\r\nTimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip did not surrender himself willingly to the passion that consumed\r\nhim. He knew that all things human are transitory and therefore that it\r\nmust cease one day or another. He looked forward to that day with eager\r\nlonging. Love was like a parasite in his heart, nourishing a hateful\r\nexistence on his life\xe2\x80\x99s blood; it absorbed his existence so intensely\r\nthat he could take pleasure in nothing else. He had been used to\r\ndelight in the grace of St. James\xe2\x80\x99 Park, and often he sat and looked at\r\nthe branches of a tree silhouetted against the sky, it was like a\r\nJapanese print; and he found a continual magic in the beautiful Thames\r\nwith its barges and its wharfs; the changing sky of London had filled\r\nhis soul with pleasant fancies. But now beauty meant nothing to him. He\r\nwas bored and restless when he was not with Mildred. Sometimes he\r\nthought he would console his sorrow by looking at pictures, but he\r\nwalked through the National Gallery like a sight-seer; and no picture\r\ncalled up in him a thrill of emotion. He wondered if he could ever care\r\nagain for all the things he had loved. He had been devoted to reading,\r\nbut now books were meaningless; and he spent his spare hours in the\r\nsmoking-room of the hospital club, turning over innumerable\r\nperiodicals. This love was a torment, and he resented bitterly the\r\nsubjugation in which it held him; he was a prisoner and he longed for\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nSometimes he awoke in the morning and felt nothing; his soul leaped,\r\nfor he thought he was free; he loved no longer; but in a little while,\r\nas he grew wide awake, the pain settled in his heart, and he knew that\r\nhe was not cured yet. Though he yearned for Mildred so madly he\r\ndespised her. He thought to himself that there could be no greater\r\ntorture in the world than at the same time to love and to contemn.\r\n\r\nPhilip, burrowing as was his habit into the state of his feelings,\r\ndiscussing with himself continually his condition, came to the\r\nconclusion that he could only cure himself of his degrading passion by\r\nmaking Mildred his mistress. It was sexual hunger that he suffered\r\nfrom, and if he could satisfy this he might free himself from the\r\nintolerable chains that bound him. He knew that Mildred did not care\r\nfor him at all in that way. When he kissed her passionately she\r\nwithdrew herself from him with instinctive distaste. She had no\r\nsensuality. Sometimes he had tried to make her jealous by talking of\r\nadventures in Paris, but they did not interest her; once or twice he\r\nhad sat at other tables in the tea-shop and affected to flirt with the\r\nwaitress who attended them, but she was entirely indifferent. He could\r\nsee that it was no pretence on her part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind my not sitting at one of your tables this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked once, when he was walking to the station with her. \xe2\x80\x9cYours\r\nseemed to be all full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not a fact, but she did not contradict him. Even if his\r\ndesertion meant nothing to her he would have been grateful if she had\r\npretended it did. A reproach would have been balm to his soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s silly of you to sit at the same table every day. You\r\nought to give the other girls a turn now and again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the more he thought of it the more he was convinced that complete\r\nsurrender on her part was his only way to freedom. He was like a knight\r\nof old, metamorphosed by magic spells, who sought the potions which\r\nshould restore him to his fair and proper form. Philip had only one\r\nhope. Mildred greatly desired to go to Paris. To her, as to most\r\nEnglish people, it was the centre of gaiety and fashion: she had heard\r\nof the Magasin du Louvre, where you could get the very latest thing for\r\nabout half the price you had to pay in London; a friend of hers had\r\npassed her honeymoon in Paris and had spent all day at the Louvre; and\r\nshe and her husband, my dear, they never went to bed till six in the\r\nmorning all the time they were there; the Moulin Rouge and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat all. Philip did not care that if she yielded to his desires it\r\nwould only be the unwilling price she paid for the gratification of her\r\nwish. He did not care upon what terms he satisfied his passion. He had\r\neven had a mad, melodramatic idea to drug her. He had plied her with\r\nliquor in the hope of exciting her, but she had no taste for wine; and\r\nthough she liked him to order champagne because it looked well, she\r\nnever drank more than half a glass. She liked to leave untouched a\r\nlarge glass filled to the brim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shows the waiters who you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip chose an opportunity when she seemed more than usually friendly.\r\nHe had an examination in anatomy at the end of March. Easter, which\r\ncame a week later, would give Mildred three whole days holiday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come over to Paris then?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave such a ripping time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you? It would cost no end of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had thought of that. It would cost at least five-and-twenty\r\npounds. It was a large sum to him. He was willing to spend his last\r\npenny on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter? Say you\xe2\x80\x99ll come, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next, I should like to know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see myself going away with a\r\nman that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t married to. You oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to suggest such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe enlarged on the glories of the Rue de la Paix and the garish\r\nsplendour of the Folies Bergeres. He described the Louvre and the Bon\r\nMarche. He told her about the Cabaret du Neant, the Abbaye, and the\r\nvarious haunts to which foreigners go. He painted in glowing colours\r\nthe side of Paris which he despised. He pressed her to come with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you say you love me, but if you really loved me you\xe2\x80\x99d want\r\nto marry me. You\xe2\x80\x99ve never asked me to marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it. After all, I\xe2\x80\x99m in my first year, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nearn a penny for six years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not blaming you. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry you if you went down on your\r\nbended knees to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had thought of marriage more than once, but it was a step from which\r\nhe shrank. In Paris he had come by the opinion that marriage was a\r\nridiculous institution of the philistines. He knew also that a\r\npermanent tie would ruin him. He had middle-class instincts, and it\r\nseemed a dreadful thing to him to marry a waitress. A common wife would\r\nprevent him from getting a decent practice. Besides, he had only just\r\nenough money to last him till he was qualified; he could not keep a\r\nwife even if they arranged not to have children. He thought of Cronshaw\r\nbound to a vulgar slattern, and he shuddered with dismay. He foresaw\r\nwhat Mildred, with her genteel ideas and her mean mind, would become:\r\nit was impossible for him to marry her. But he decided only with his\r\nreason; he felt that he must have her whatever happened; and if he\r\ncould not get her without marrying her he would do that; the future\r\ncould look after itself. It might end in disaster; he did not care.\r\nWhen he got hold of an idea it obsessed him, he could think of nothing\r\nelse, and he had a more than common power to persuade himself of the\r\nreasonableness of what he wished to do. He found himself overthrowing\r\nall the sensible arguments which had occurred to him against marriage.\r\nEach day he found that he was more passionately devoted to her; and his\r\nunsatisfied love became angry and resentful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George, if I marry her I\xe2\x80\x99ll make her pay for all the suffering I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nendured,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\nAt last he could bear the agony no longer. After dinner one evening in\r\nthe little restaurant in Soho, to which now they often went, he spoke\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, did you mean it the other day that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry me if I\r\nasked you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without you. I want you with me always. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntried to get over it and I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I never shall now. I want you to\r\nmarry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had read too many novelettes not to know how to take such an offer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful to you, Philip. I\xe2\x80\x99m very much flattered at\r\nyour proposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk rot. You will marry me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think we should be happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But what does that matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were wrung out of him almost against his will. They surprised\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are a funny chap. Why d\xe2\x80\x99you want to marry me then? The other\r\nday you said you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got about fourteen hundred pounds left. Two can live just\r\nas cheaply as one. That\xe2\x80\x99ll keep us till I\xe2\x80\x99m qualified and have got\r\nthrough with my hospital appointments, and then I can get an\r\nassistantship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to earn anything for six years. We\r\nshould have about four pounds a week to live on till then, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much more than three. There are all my fees to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would you get as an assistant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree pounds a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say you have to work all that time and spend a small\r\nfortune just to earn three pounds a week at the end of it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nthat I should be any better off than I am now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say you won\xe2\x80\x99t marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes my\r\ngreat love mean nothing to you at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne has to think of oneself in those things, don\xe2\x80\x99t one? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind marrying, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be no better\r\noff than what I am now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the use of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you cared for me you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x99raps not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent. He drank a glass of wine in order to get rid of the\r\nchoking in his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that girl who\xe2\x80\x99s just going out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred. \xe2\x80\x9cShe got them\r\nfurs at the Bon Marche at Brixton. I saw them in the window last time I\r\nwent down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true. And I said to my\r\naunt at the time, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy anything that had been in the window\r\nlike that, for everyone to know how much you paid for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand you. You make me frightfully unhappy, and in the\r\nnext breath you talk rot that has nothing to do with what we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nspeaking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are nasty to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, aggrieved. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help noticing\r\nthose furs, because I said to my aunt\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn what you said to your aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use bad language when you speak to me Philip. You\r\nknow I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled a little, but his eyes were wild. He was silent for a\r\nwhile. He looked at her sullenly. He hated, despised, and loved her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had an ounce of sense I\xe2\x80\x99d never see you again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you only knew how heartily I despise myself for loving you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not a very nice thing to say to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied sulkily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go to the Pavilion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s so funny in you, you start laughing just when one\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to. And if I make you that unhappy why d\xe2\x80\x99you want to\r\ntake me to the Pavilion? I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely because I\xe2\x80\x99m less unhappy with you than away from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know what you really think of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, if you did you\xe2\x80\x99d never speak to me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip did not pass the examination in anatomy at the end of March. He\r\nand Dunsford had worked at the subject together on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s skeleton,\r\nasking each other questions till both knew by heart every attachment\r\nand the meaning of every nodule and groove on the human bones; but in\r\nthe examination room Philip was seized with panic, and failed to give\r\nright answers to questions from a sudden fear that they might be wrong.\r\nHe knew he was ploughed and did not even trouble to go up to the\r\nbuilding next day to see whether his number was up. The second failure\r\nput him definitely among the incompetent and idle men of his year.\r\n\r\nHe did not care much. He had other things to think of. He told himself\r\nthat Mildred must have senses like anybody else, it was only a question\r\nof awakening them; he had theories about woman, the rip at heart, and\r\nthought that there must come a time with everyone when she would yield\r\nto persistence. It was a question of watching for the opportunity,\r\nkeeping his temper, wearing her down with small attentions, taking\r\nadvantage of the physical exhaustion which opened the heart to\r\ntenderness, making himself a refuge from the petty vexations of her\r\nwork. He talked to her of the relations between his friends in Paris\r\nand the fair ladies they admired. The life he described had a charm, an\r\neasy gaiety, in which was no grossness. Weaving into his own\r\nrecollections the adventures of Mimi and Rodolphe, of Musette and the\r\nrest of them, he poured into Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s ears a story of poverty made\r\npicturesque by song and laughter, of lawless love made romantic by\r\nbeauty and youth. He never attacked her prejudices directly, but sought\r\nto combat them by the suggestion that they were suburban. He never let\r\nhimself be disturbed by her inattention, nor irritated by her\r\nindifference. He thought he had bored her. By an effort he made himself\r\naffable and entertaining; he never let himself be angry, he never asked\r\nfor anything, he never complained, he never scolded. When she made\r\nengagements and broke them, he met her next day with a smiling face;\r\nwhen she excused herself, he said it did not matter. He never let her\r\nsee that she pained him. He understood that his passionate grief had\r\nwearied her, and he took care to hide every sentiment which could be in\r\nthe least degree troublesome. He was heroic.\r\n\r\nThough she never mentioned the change, for she did not take any\r\nconscious notice of it, it affected her nevertheless: she became more\r\nconfidential with him; she took her little grievances to him, and she\r\nalways had some grievance against the manageress of the shop, one of\r\nher fellow waitresses, or her aunt; she was talkative enough now, and\r\nthough she never said anything that was not trivial Philip was never\r\ntired of listening to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you when you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make love to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s flattering for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\nShe did not realise how her words made his heart sink nor what an\r\neffort it needed for him to answer so lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind your kissing me now and then. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me and\r\nit gives you pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOccasionally she went so far as to ask him to take her out to dinner,\r\nand the offer, coming from her, filled him with rapture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it to anyone else,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, by way of apology. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nknow I can with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give me greater pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\nShe asked him to give her something to eat one evening towards the end\r\nof April.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere would you like to go afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s go anywhere. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just sit and talk. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\r\ndo you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought she must be beginning to care for him. Three months before\r\nthe thought of an evening spent in conversation would have bored her to\r\ndeath. It was a fine day, and the spring added to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s high\r\nspirits. He was content with very little now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, won\xe2\x80\x99t it be ripping when the summer comes along,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as\r\nthey drove along on the top of a \xe2\x80\x99bus to Soho\xe2\x80\x94she had herself suggested\r\nthat they should not be so extravagant as to go by cab. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be\r\nable to spend every Sunday on the river. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take our luncheon in a\r\nbasket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled slightly, and he was encouraged to take her hand. She did\r\nnot withdraw it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really think you\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to like me a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE silly, you know I like you, or else I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here,\r\nshould I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were old customers at the little restaurant in Soho by now, and\r\nthe patronne gave them a smile as they came in. The waiter was\r\nobsequious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me order the dinner tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred.\r\n\r\nPhilip, thinking her more enchanting than ever, gave her the menu, and\r\nshe chose her favourite dishes. The range was small, and they had eaten\r\nmany times all that the restaurant could provide. Philip was gay. He\r\nlooked into her eyes, and he dwelt on every perfection of her pale\r\ncheek. When they had finished Mildred by way of exception took a\r\ncigarette. She smoked very seldom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see a lady smoking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment and then spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you surprised, my asking you to take me out and give me a bit of\r\ndinner tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was delighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got something to say to you, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her quickly, his heart sank, but he had trained himself\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, fire away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be silly about it, are you? The fact is I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto get married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe could think of nothing else to say. He had considered the\r\npossibility often and had imagined to himself what he would do and say.\r\nHe had suffered agonies when he thought of the despair he would suffer,\r\nhe had thought of suicide, of the mad passion of anger that would seize\r\nhim; but perhaps he had too completely anticipated the emotion he would\r\nexperience, so that now he felt merely exhausted. He felt as one does\r\nin a serious illness when the vitality is so low that one is\r\nindifferent to the issue and wants only to be left alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-four and it\xe2\x80\x99s time I\r\nsettled down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent. He looked at the patronne sitting behind the counter,\r\nand his eye dwelt on a red feather one of the diners wore in her hat.\r\nMildred was nettled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might congratulate me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t I? I can hardly believe it\xe2\x80\x99s true. I\xe2\x80\x99ve dreamt it so\r\noften. It rather tickles me that I should have been so jolly glad that\r\nyou asked me to take you out to dinner. Whom are you going to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiller,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with a slight blush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiller?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip, astounded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen him for\r\nmonths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came in to lunch one day last week and asked me then. He\xe2\x80\x99s earning\r\nvery good money. He makes seven pounds a week now and he\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nprospects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent again. He remembered that she had always liked\r\nMiller; he amused her; there was in his foreign birth an exotic charm\r\nwhich she felt unconsciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it was inevitable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were bound to\r\naccept the highest bidder. When are you going to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Saturday next. I have given notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt a sudden pang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to be married at a registry office. Emil prefers it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt dreadfully tired. He wanted to get away from her. He\r\nthought he would go straight to bed. He called for the bill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put you in a cab and send you down to Victoria. I daresay you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait long for a train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered haughtily. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I shall\r\nsee you at tea-time tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d better make a full stop now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I should\r\ngo on making myself unhappy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve paid the cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded to her and forced a smile on his lips, then jumped on a \xe2\x80\x99bus\r\nand made his way home. He smoked a pipe before he went to bed, but he\r\ncould hardly keep his eyes open. He suffered no pain. He fell into a\r\nheavy sleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBut about three in the morning Philip awoke and could not sleep again.\r\nHe began to think of Mildred. He tried not to, but could not help\r\nhimself. He repeated to himself the same thing time after time till his\r\nbrain reeled. It was inevitable that she should marry: life was hard\r\nfor a girl who had to earn her own living; and if she found someone who\r\ncould give her a comfortable home she should not be blamed if she\r\naccepted. Philip acknowledged that from her point of view it would have\r\nbeen madness to marry him: only love could have made such poverty\r\nbearable, and she did not love him. It was no fault of hers; it was a\r\nfact that must be accepted like any other. Philip tried to reason with\r\nhimself. He told himself that deep down in his heart was mortified\r\npride; his passion had begun in wounded vanity, and it was this at\r\nbottom which caused now a great part of his wretchedness. He despised\r\nhimself as much as he despised her. Then he made plans for the future,\r\nthe same plans over and over again, interrupted by recollections of\r\nkisses on her soft pale cheek and by the sound of her voice with its\r\ntrailing accent; he had a great deal of work to do, since in the summer\r\nhe was taking chemistry as well as the two examinations he had failed\r\nin. He had separated himself from his friends at the hospital, but now\r\nhe wanted companionship. There was one happy occurrence: Hayward a\r\nfortnight before had written to say that he was passing through London\r\nand had asked him to dinner; but Philip, unwilling to be bothered, had\r\nrefused. He was coming back for the season, and Philip made up his mind\r\nto write to him.\r\n\r\nHe was thankful when eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck and he could get up. He was\r\npale and weary. But when he had bathed, dressed, and had breakfast, he\r\nfelt himself joined up again with the world at large; and his pain was\r\na little easier to bear. He did not feel like going to lectures that\r\nmorning, but went instead to the Army and Navy Stores to buy Mildred a\r\nwedding-present. After much wavering he settled on a dressing-bag. It\r\ncost twenty pounds, which was much more than he could afford, but it\r\nwas showy and vulgar: he knew she would be aware exactly how much it\r\ncost; he got a melancholy satisfaction in choosing a gift which would\r\ngive her pleasure and at the same time indicate for himself the\r\ncontempt he had for her.\r\n\r\nPhilip had looked forward with apprehension to the day on which Mildred\r\nwas to be married; he was expecting an intolerable anguish; and it was\r\nwith relief that he got a letter from Hayward on Saturday morning to\r\nsay that he was coming up early on that very day and would fetch Philip\r\nto help him to find rooms. Philip, anxious to be distracted, looked up\r\na time-table and discovered the only train Hayward was likely to come\r\nby; he went to meet him, and the reunion of the friends was\r\nenthusiastic. They left the luggage at the station, and set off gaily.\r\nHayward characteristically proposed that first of all they should go\r\nfor an hour to the National Gallery; he had not seen pictures for some\r\ntime, and he stated that it needed a glimpse to set him in tune with\r\nlife. Philip for months had had no one with whom he could talk of art\r\nand books. Since the Paris days Hayward had immersed himself in the\r\nmodern French versifiers, and, such a plethora of poets is there in\r\nFrance, he had several new geniuses to tell Philip about. They walked\r\nthrough the gallery pointing out to one another their favourite\r\npictures; one subject led to another; they talked excitedly. The sun\r\nwas shining and the air was warm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go and sit in the Park,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hayward. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll look for rooms\r\nafter luncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe spring was pleasant there. It was a day upon which one felt it good\r\nmerely to live. The young green of the trees was exquisite against the\r\nsky; and the sky, pale and blue, was dappled with little white clouds.\r\nAt the end of the ornamental water was the gray mass of the Horse\r\nGuards. The ordered elegance of the scene had the charm of an\r\neighteenth-century picture. It reminded you not of Watteau, whose\r\nlandscapes are so idyllic that they recall only the woodland glens seen\r\nin dreams, but of the more prosaic Jean-Baptiste Pater. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nwas filled with lightness. He realised, what he had only read before,\r\nthat art (for there was art in the manner in which he looked upon\r\nnature) might liberate the soul from pain.\r\n\r\nThey went to an Italian restaurant for luncheon and ordered themselves\r\na fiaschetto of Chianti. Lingering over the meal they talked on. They\r\nreminded one another of the people they had known at Heidelberg, they\r\nspoke of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s friends in Paris, they talked of books, pictures,\r\nmorals, life; and suddenly Philip heard a clock strike three. He\r\nremembered that by this time Mildred was married. He felt a sort of\r\nstitch in his heart, and for a minute or two he could not hear what\r\nHayward was saying. But he filled his glass with Chianti. He was\r\nunaccustomed to alcohol and it had gone to his head. For the time at\r\nall events he was free from care. His quick brain had lain idle for so\r\nmany months that he was intoxicated now with conversation. He was\r\nthankful to have someone to talk to who would interest himself in the\r\nthings that interested him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s waste this beautiful day in looking for rooms. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nput you up tonight. You can look for rooms tomorrow or Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. What shall we do?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Hayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get on a penny steamboat and go down to Greenwich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea appealed to Hayward, and they jumped into a cab which took\r\nthem to Westminster Bridge. They got on the steamboat just as she was\r\nstarting. Presently Philip, a smile on his lips, spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember when first I went to Paris, Clutton, I think it was, gave a\r\nlong discourse on the subject that beauty is put into things by\r\npainters and poets. They create beauty. In themselves there is nothing\r\nto choose between the Campanile of Giotto and a factory chimney. And\r\nthen beautiful things grow rich with the emotion that they have aroused\r\nin succeeding generations. That is why old things are more beautiful\r\nthan modern. The Ode on a Grecian Urn is more lovely now than when it\r\nwas written, because for a hundred years lovers have read it and the\r\nsick at heart taken comfort in its lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip left Hayward to infer what in the passing scene had suggested\r\nthese words to him, and it was a delight to know that he could safely\r\nleave the inference. It was in sudden reaction from the life he had\r\nbeen leading for so long that he was now deeply affected. The delicate\r\niridescence of the London air gave the softness of a pastel to the gray\r\nstone of the buildings; and in the wharfs and storehouses there was the\r\nseverity of grace of a Japanese print. They went further down; and the\r\nsplendid channel, a symbol of the great empire, broadened, and it was\r\ncrowded with traffic; Philip thought of the painters and the poets who\r\nhad made all these things so beautiful, and his heart was filled with\r\ngratitude. They came to the Pool of London, and who can describe its\r\nmajesty? The imagination thrills, and Heaven knows what figures people\r\nstill its broad stream, Doctor Johnson with Boswell by his side, an old\r\nPepys going on board a man-o\xe2\x80\x99-war: the pageant of English history, and\r\nromance, and high adventure. Philip turned to Hayward with shining\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Charles Dickens,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, smiling a little at his own\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you rather sorry you chucked painting?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you like doctoring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I hate it, but there was nothing else to do. The drudgery of the\r\nfirst two years is awful, and unfortunately I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the\r\nscientific temperament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t go on changing professions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stick to this. I think I shall like it better\r\nwhen I get into the wards. I have an idea that I\xe2\x80\x99m more interested in\r\npeople than in anything else in the world. And as far as I can see,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the only profession in which you have your freedom. You carry your\r\nknowledge in your head; with a box of instruments and a few drugs you\r\ncan make your living anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to take a practice then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for a good long time at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got through my hospital appointments I shall get a ship; I want to\r\ngo to the East\xe2\x80\x94the Malay Archipelago, Siam, China, and all that sort of\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94and then I shall take odd jobs. Something always comes along,\r\ncholera duty in India and things like that. I want to go from place to\r\nplace. I want to see the world. The only way a poor man can do that is\r\nby going in for the medical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey came to Greenwich then. The noble building of Inigo Jones faced\r\nthe river grandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, look, that must be the place where Poor Jack dived into the mud\r\nfor pennies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nThey wandered in the park. Ragged children were playing in it, and it\r\nwas noisy with their cries: here and there old seamen were basking in\r\nthe sun. There was an air of a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a pity you wasted two years in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaste? Look at the movement of that child, look at the pattern which\r\nthe sun makes on the ground, shining through the trees, look at that\r\nsky\xe2\x80\x94why, I should never have seen that sky if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHayward thought that Philip choked a sob, and he looked at him with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to be so damned emotional, but for six months I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen starved for beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used to be so matter of fact. It\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting to hear you\r\nsay that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngo and have a stodgy tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV\r\n\r\n\r\nHayward\xe2\x80\x99s visit did Philip a great deal of good. Each day his thoughts\r\ndwelt less on Mildred. He looked back upon the past with disgust. He\r\ncould not understand how he had submitted to the dishonour of such a\r\nlove; and when he thought of Mildred it was with angry hatred, because\r\nshe had submitted him to so much humiliation. His imagination presented\r\nher to him now with her defects of person and manner exaggerated, so\r\nthat he shuddered at the thought of having been connected with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just shows how damned weak I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. The adventure\r\nwas like a blunder that one had committed at a party so horrible that\r\none felt nothing could be done to excuse it: the only remedy was to\r\nforget. His horror at the degradation he had suffered helped him. He\r\nwas like a snake casting its skin and he looked upon the old covering\r\nwith nausea. He exulted in the possession of himself once more; he\r\nrealised how much of the delight of the world he had lost when he was\r\nabsorbed in that madness which they called love; he had had enough of\r\nit; he did not want to be in love any more if love was that. Philip\r\ntold Hayward something of what he had gone through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it Sophocles,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwho prayed for the time when he would\r\nbe delivered from the wild beast of passion that devoured his\r\nheart-strings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip seemed really to be born again. He breathed the circumambient\r\nair as though he had never breathed it before, and he took a child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npleasure in all the facts of the world. He called his period of\r\ninsanity six months\xe2\x80\x99 hard labour.\r\n\r\nHayward had only been settled in London a few days when Philip received\r\nfrom Blackstable, where it had been sent, a card for a private view at\r\nsome picture gallery. He took Hayward, and, on looking at the\r\ncatalogue, saw that Lawson had a picture in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he sent the card,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go and find him, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsure to be in front of his picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, a profile of Ruth Chalice, was tucked away in a corner, and\r\nLawson was not far from it. He looked a little lost, in his large soft\r\nhat and loose, pale clothes, amongst the fashionable throng that had\r\ngathered for the private view. He greeted Philip with enthusiasm, and\r\nwith his usual volubility told him that he had come to live in London,\r\nRuth Chalice was a hussy, he had taken a studio, Paris was played out,\r\nhe had a commission for a portrait, and they\xe2\x80\x99d better dine together and\r\nhave a good old talk. Philip reminded him of his acquaintance with\r\nHayward, and was entertained to see that Lawson was slightly awed by\r\nHayward\xe2\x80\x99s elegant clothes and grand manner. They sat upon him better\r\nthan they had done in the shabby little studio which Lawson and Philip\r\nhad shared.\r\n\r\nAt dinner Lawson went on with his news. Flanagan had gone back to\r\nAmerica. Clutton had disappeared. He had come to the conclusion that a\r\nman had no chance of doing anything so long as he was in contact with\r\nart and artists: the only thing was to get right away. To make the step\r\neasier he had quarrelled with all his friends in Paris. He developed a\r\ntalent for telling them home truths, which made them bear with\r\nfortitude his declaration that he had done with that city and was\r\nsettling in Gerona, a little town in the north of Spain which had\r\nattracted him when he saw it from the train on his way to Barcelona. He\r\nwas living there now alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99ll ever do any good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe was interested in the human side of that struggle to express\r\nsomething which was so obscure in the man\xe2\x80\x99s mind that he was become\r\nmorbid and querulous. Philip felt vaguely that he was himself in the\r\nsame case, but with him it was the conduct of his life as a whole that\r\nperplexed him. That was his means of self-expression, and what he must\r\ndo with it was not clear. But he had no time to continue with this\r\ntrain of thought, for Lawson poured out a frank recital of his affair\r\nwith Ruth Chalice. She had left him for a young student who had just\r\ncome from England, and was behaving in a scandalous fashion. Lawson\r\nreally thought someone ought to step in and save the young man. She\r\nwould ruin him. Philip gathered that Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s chief grievance was that\r\nthe rupture had come in the middle of a portrait he was painting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen have no real feeling for art,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey only pretend they\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d But he finished philosophically enough: \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I got four\r\nportraits out of her, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if the last I was working on\r\nwould ever have been a success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip envied the easy way in which the painter managed his love\r\naffairs. He had passed eighteen months pleasantly enough, had got an\r\nexcellent model for nothing, and had parted from her at the end with no\r\ngreat pang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about Cronshaw?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s done for,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Lawson, with the cheerful callousness of\r\nhis youth. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be dead in six months. He got pneumonia last winter.\r\nHe was in the English hospital for seven weeks, and when he came out\r\nthey told him his only chance was to give up liquor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor devil,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled the abstemious Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kept off for a bit. He used to go to the Lilas all the same, he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep away from that, but he used to drink hot milk, avec de la\r\nfleur d\xe2\x80\x99oranger, and he was damned dull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take it you did not conceal the fact from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he knew it himself. A little while ago he started on whiskey\r\nagain. He said he was too old to turn over any new leaves. He would\r\nrather be happy for six months and die at the end of it than linger on\r\nfor five years. And then I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been awfully hard up lately. You\r\nsee, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t earn anything while he was ill, and the slut he lives\r\nwith has been giving him a rotten time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember, the first time I saw him I admired him awfully,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was wonderful. It is sickening that vulgar,\r\nmiddle-class virtue should pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he was a rotter. He was bound to end in the gutter sooner or\r\nlater,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson.\r\n\r\nPhilip was hurt because Lawson would not see the pity of it. Of course\r\nit was cause and effect, but in the necessity with which one follows\r\nthe other lay all tragedy of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson. \xe2\x80\x9cJust after you left he sent round a\r\npresent for you. I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be coming back and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother\r\nabout it, and then I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it worth sending on; but it\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nover to London with the rest of my things, and you can come to my\r\nstudio one day and fetch it away if you want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me what it is yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a ragged little bit of carpet. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworth anything. I asked him one day what the devil he\xe2\x80\x99d sent the filthy\r\nthing for. He told me he\xe2\x80\x99d seen it in a shop in the Rue de Rennes and\r\nbought it for fifteen francs. It appears to be a Persian rug. He said\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d asked him the meaning of life and that was the answer. But he was\r\nvery drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I know. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it. It was a favourite wheeze of his. He\r\nsaid I must find out for myself, or else the answer meant nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip worked well and easily; he had a good deal to do, since he was\r\ntaking in July the three parts of the First Conjoint examination, two\r\nof which he had failed in before; but he found life pleasant. He made a\r\nnew friend. Lawson, on the lookout for models, had discovered a girl\r\nwho was understudying at one of the theatres, and in order to induce\r\nher to sit to him arranged a little luncheon-party one Sunday. She\r\nbrought a chaperon with her; and to her Philip, asked to make a fourth,\r\nwas instructed to confine his attentions. He found this easy, since she\r\nturned out to be an agreeable chatterbox with an amusing tongue. She\r\nasked Philip to go and see her; she had rooms in Vincent Square, and\r\nwas always in to tea at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock; he went, was delighted with his\r\nwelcome, and went again. Mrs. Nesbit was not more than twenty-five,\r\nvery small, with a pleasant, ugly face; she had very bright eyes, high\r\ncheekbones, and a large mouth: the excessive contrasts of her colouring\r\nreminded one of a portrait by one of the modern French painters; her\r\nskin was very white, her cheeks were very red, her thick eyebrows, her\r\nhair, were very black. The effect was odd, a little unnatural, but far\r\nfrom unpleasing. She was separated from her husband and earned her\r\nliving and her child\xe2\x80\x99s by writing penny novelettes. There were one or\r\ntwo publishers who made a specialty of that sort of thing, and she had\r\nas much work as she could do. It was ill-paid, she received fifteen\r\npounds for a story of thirty thousand words; but she was satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, it only costs the reader twopence,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\r\nlike the same thing over and over again. I just change the names and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all. When I\xe2\x80\x99m bored I think of the washing and the rent and\r\nclothes for baby, and I go on again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBesides, she walked on at various theatres where they wanted supers and\r\nearned by this when in work from sixteen shillings to a guinea a week.\r\nAt the end of her day she was so tired that she slept like a top. She\r\nmade the best of her difficult lot. Her keen sense of humour enabled\r\nher to get amusement out of every vexatious circumstance. Sometimes\r\nthings went wrong, and she found herself with no money at all; then her\r\ntrifling possessions found their way to a pawnshop in the Vauxhall\r\nBridge Road, and she ate bread and butter till things grew brighter.\r\nShe never lost her cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nPhilip was interested in her shiftless life, and she made him laugh\r\nwith the fantastic narration of her struggles. He asked her why she did\r\nnot try her hand at literary work of a better sort, but she knew that\r\nshe had no talent, and the abominable stuff she turned out by the\r\nthousand words was not only tolerably paid, but was the best she could\r\ndo. She had nothing to look forward to but a continuation of the life\r\nshe led. She seemed to have no relations, and her friends were as poor\r\nas herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think of the future,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as I have enough\r\nmoney for three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 rent and a pound or two over for food I never\r\nbother. Life wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worth living if I worried over the future as\r\nwell as the present. When things are at their worst I find something\r\nalways happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon Philip grew in the habit of going in to tea with her every day,\r\nand so that his visits might not embarrass her he took in a cake or a\r\npound of butter or some tea. They started to call one another by their\r\nChristian names. Feminine sympathy was new to him, and he delighted in\r\nsomeone who gave a willing ear to all his troubles. The hours went\r\nquickly. He did not hide his admiration for her. She was a delightful\r\ncompanion. He could not help comparing her with Mildred; and he\r\ncontrasted with the one\xe2\x80\x99s obstinate stupidity, which refused interest\r\nto everything she did not know, the other\xe2\x80\x99s quick appreciation and\r\nready intelligence. His heart sank when he thought that he might have\r\nbeen tied for life to such a woman as Mildred. One evening he told\r\nNorah the whole story of his love. It was not one to give him much\r\nreason for self-esteem, and it was very pleasant to receive such\r\ncharming sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re well out of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when he had finished.\r\n\r\nShe had a funny way at times of holding her head on one side like an\r\nAberdeen puppy. She was sitting in an upright chair, sewing, for she\r\nhad no time to do nothing, and Philip had made himself comfortable at\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how heartily thankful I am it\xe2\x80\x99s all over,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing, you must have had a rotten time,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, and by way\r\nof showing her sympathy put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe took it and kissed it, but she withdrew it quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a blush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a moment with twinkling eyes, and she smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe got up on his knees and faced her. She looked into his eyes\r\nsteadily, and her large mouth trembled with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you are a ripper. I\xe2\x80\x99m so grateful to you for being nice to\r\nme. I like you so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be idiotic,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip took hold of her elbows and drew her towards him. She made no\r\nresistance, but bent forward a little, and he kissed her red lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but a tender look came into her eyes, and she\r\npassed her hand softly over his hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully silly of you to behave like this. We were such\r\ngood friends. It would be so jolly to leave it at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want to appeal to my better nature,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Philip,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll do well not to stroke my cheek while you\xe2\x80\x99re doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a little chuckle, but she did not stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very wrong of me, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip, surprised and a little amused, looked into her eyes, and as he\r\nlooked he saw them soften and grow liquid, and there was an expression\r\nin them that enchanted him. His heart was suddenly stirred, and tears\r\ncame to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah, you\xe2\x80\x99re not fond of me, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou clever boy, you ask such stupid questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear, it never struck me that you could be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flung his arms round her and kissed her, while she, laughing,\r\nblushing, and crying, surrendered herself willingly to his embrace.\r\n\r\nPresently he released her and sitting back on his heels looked at her\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m blowed!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pleased?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelighted,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with all his heart, \xe2\x80\x9cand so proud and so happy\r\nand so grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hands and covered them with kisses. This was the beginning\r\nfor Philip of a happiness which seemed both solid and durable. They\r\nbecame lovers but remained friends. There was in Norah a maternal\r\ninstinct which received satisfaction in her love for Philip; she wanted\r\nsomeone to pet, and scold, and make a fuss of; she had a domestic\r\ntemperament and found pleasure in looking after his health and his\r\nlinen. She pitied his deformity, over which he was so sensitive, and\r\nher pity expressed itself instinctively in tenderness. She was young,\r\nstrong, and healthy, and it seemed quite natural to her to give her\r\nlove. She had high spirits and a merry soul. She liked Philip because\r\nhe laughed with her at all the amusing things in life that caught her\r\nfancy, and above all she liked him because he was he.\r\n\r\nWhen she told him this he answered gaily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. You like me because I\xe2\x80\x99m a silent person and never want to\r\nget a word in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not love her at all. He was extremely fond of her, glad to\r\nbe with her, amused and interested by her conversation. She restored\r\nhis belief in himself and put healing ointments, as it were, on all the\r\nbruises of his soul. He was immensely flattered that she cared for him.\r\nHe admired her courage, her optimism, her impudent defiance of fate;\r\nshe had a little philosophy of her own, ingenuous and practical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in churches and parsons and all that,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I believe in God, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe He minds much about\r\nwhat you do as long as you keep your end up and help a lame dog over a\r\nstile when you can. And I think people on the whole are very nice, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for those who aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know for certain, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I hope\r\nfor the best. And anyhow there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no rent to pay and no novelettes\r\nto write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a feminine gift for delicate flattery. She thought that Philip\r\ndid a brave thing when he left Paris because he was conscious he could\r\nnot be a great artist; and he was enchanted when she expressed\r\nenthusiastic admiration for him. He had never been quite certain\r\nwhether this action indicated courage or infirmity of purpose. It was\r\ndelightful to realise that she considered it heroic. She ventured to\r\ntackle him on a subject which his friends instinctively avoided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very silly of you to be so sensitive about your club-foot,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. She saw him blush darkly, but went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, people don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink about it nearly as much as you do. They notice it the first time\r\nthey see you, and then they forget about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not angry with me, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her arm round his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I only speak about it because I love you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to\r\nmake you unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you can say anything you choose to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could do something to show you how grateful I am to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took him in hand in other ways. She would not let him be bearish\r\nand laughed at him when he was out of temper. She made him more urbane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can make me do anything you like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I want to do what you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had the sense to realise his happiness. It seemed to him that she\r\ngave him all that a wife could, and he preserved his freedom; she was\r\nthe most charming friend he had ever had, with a sympathy that he had\r\nnever found in a man. The sexual relationship was no more than the\r\nstrongest link in their friendship. It completed it, but was not\r\nessential. And because Philip\xe2\x80\x99s appetites were satisfied, he became\r\nmore equable and easier to live with. He felt in complete possession of\r\nhimself. He thought sometimes of the winter, during which he had been\r\nobsessed by a hideous passion, and he was filled with loathing for\r\nMildred and with horror of himself.\r\n\r\nHis examinations were approaching, and Norah was as interested in them\r\nas he. He was flattered and touched by her eagerness. She made him\r\npromise to come at once and tell her the results. He passed the three\r\nparts this time without mishap, and when he went to tell her she burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad, I was so anxious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou silly little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, but he was choking.\r\n\r\nNo one could help being pleased with the way she took it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you going to do now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can take a holiday with a clear conscience. I have no work to do\r\ntill the winter session begins in October.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll go down to your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s at Blackstable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou suppose quite wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stay in London and play with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather you went away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Are you tired of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed and put her hands on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working hard, and you look utterly washed out. You\r\nwant some fresh air and a rest. Please go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer for a moment. He looked at her with loving eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\xe2\x80\x99d never believe it of anyone but you. You\xe2\x80\x99re only thinking\r\nof my good. I wonder what you see in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give me a good character with my month\xe2\x80\x99s notice?\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed\r\ngaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say that you\xe2\x80\x99re thoughtful and kind, and you\xe2\x80\x99re not exacting; you\r\nnever worry, you\xe2\x80\x99re not troublesome, and you\xe2\x80\x99re easy to please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing: I\xe2\x80\x99m one\r\nof the few persons I ever met who are able to learn from experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip looked forward to his return to London with impatience. During\r\nthe two months he spent at Blackstable Norah wrote to him frequently,\r\nlong letters in a bold, large hand, in which with cheerful humour she\r\ndescribed the little events of the daily round, the domestic troubles\r\nof her landlady, rich food for laughter, the comic vexations of her\r\nrehearsals\xe2\x80\x94she was walking on in an important spectacle at one of the\r\nLondon theatres\xe2\x80\x94and her odd adventures with the publishers of\r\nnovelettes. Philip read a great deal, bathed, played tennis, and\r\nsailed. At the beginning of October he settled down in London to work\r\nfor the Second Conjoint examination. He was eager to pass it, since\r\nthat ended the drudgery of the curriculum; after it was done with the\r\nstudent became an out-patients\xe2\x80\x99 clerk, and was brought in contact with\r\nmen and women as well as with text-books. Philip saw Norah every day.\r\n\r\nLawson had been spending the summer at Poole, and had a number of\r\nsketches to show of the harbour and of the beach. He had a couple of\r\ncommissions for portraits and proposed to stay in London till the bad\r\nlight drove him away. Hayward, in London too, intended to spend the\r\nwinter abroad, but remained week after week from sheer inability to\r\nmake up his mind to go. Hayward had run to fat during the last two or\r\nthree years\xe2\x80\x94it was five years since Philip first met him in\r\nHeidelberg\xe2\x80\x94and he was prematurely bald. He was very sensitive about it\r\nand wore his hair long to conceal the unsightly patch on the crown of\r\nhis head. His only consolation was that his brow was now very noble.\r\nHis blue eyes had lost their colour; they had a listless droop; and his\r\nmouth, losing the fulness of youth, was weak and pale. He still talked\r\nvaguely of the things he was going to do in the future, but with less\r\nconviction; and he was conscious that his friends no longer believed in\r\nhim: when he had drank two or three glasses of whiskey he was inclined\r\nto be elegiac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a failure,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m unfit for the brutality of the\r\nstruggle of life. All I can do is to stand aside and let the vulgar\r\nthrong hustle by in their pursuit of the good things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave you the impression that to fail was a more delicate, a more\r\nexquisite thing, than to succeed. He insinuated that his aloofness was\r\ndue to distaste for all that was common and low. He talked beautifully\r\nof Plato.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought you\xe2\x80\x99d got through with Plato by now,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, raising his eyebrows.\r\n\r\nHe was not inclined to pursue the subject. He had discovered of late\r\nthe effective dignity of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see the use of reading the same thing over and over again,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s only a laborious form of idleness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you under the impression that you have so great a mind that\r\nyou can understand the most profound writer at a first reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to understand him, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a critic. I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested\r\nin him for his sake but for mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy d\xe2\x80\x99you read then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly for pleasure, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a habit and I\xe2\x80\x99m just as\r\nuncomfortable if I don\xe2\x80\x99t read as if I don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke, and partly to know\r\nmyself. When I read a book I seem to read it with my eyes only, but now\r\nand then I come across a passage, perhaps only a phrase, which has a\r\nmeaning for ME, and it becomes part of me; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got out of the book all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s any use to me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get anything more if I read it a\r\ndozen times. You see, it seems to me, one\xe2\x80\x99s like a closed bud, and most\r\nof what one reads and does has no effect at all; but there are certain\r\nthings that have a peculiar significance for one, and they open a\r\npetal; and the petals open one by one; and at last the flower is\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was not satisfied with his metaphor, but he did not know how\r\nelse to explain a thing which he felt and yet was not clear about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to do things, you want to become things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hayward, with\r\na shrug of the shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so vulgar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip knew Hayward very well by now. He was weak and vain, so vain\r\nthat you had to be on the watch constantly not to hurt his feelings; he\r\nmingled idleness and idealism so that he could not separate them. At\r\nLawson\xe2\x80\x99s studio one day he met a journalist, who was charmed by his\r\nconversation, and a week later the editor of a paper wrote to suggest\r\nthat he should do some criticism for him. For forty-eight hours Hayward\r\nlived in an agony of indecision. He had talked of getting occupation of\r\nthis sort so long that he had not the face to refuse outright, but the\r\nthought of doing anything filled him with panic. At last he declined\r\nthe offer and breathed freely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have interfered with my work,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat work?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip brutally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy inner life,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nThen he went on to say beautiful things about Amiel, the professor of\r\nGeneva, whose brilliancy promised achievement which was never\r\nfulfilled; till at his death the reason of his failure and the excuse\r\nwere at once manifest in the minute, wonderful journal which was found\r\namong his papers. Hayward smiled enigmatically.\r\n\r\nBut Hayward could still talk delightfully about books; his taste was\r\nexquisite and his discrimination elegant; and he had a constant\r\ninterest in ideas, which made him an entertaining companion. They meant\r\nnothing to him really, since they never had any effect on him; but he\r\ntreated them as he might have pieces of china in an auction-room,\r\nhandling them with pleasure in their shape and their glaze, pricing\r\nthem in his mind; and then, putting them back into their case, thought\r\nof them no more.\r\n\r\nAnd it was Hayward who made a momentous discovery. One evening, after\r\ndue preparation, he took Philip and Lawson to a tavern situated in Beak\r\nStreet, remarkable not only in itself and for its history\xe2\x80\x94it had\r\nmemories of eighteenth-century glories which excited the romantic\r\nimagination\xe2\x80\x94but for its snuff, which was the best in London, and above\r\nall for its punch. Hayward led them into a large, long room, dingily\r\nmagnificent, with huge pictures on the walls of nude women: they were\r\nvast allegories of the school of Haydon; but smoke, gas, and the London\r\natmosphere had given them a richness which made them look like old\r\nmasters. The dark panelling, the massive, tarnished gold of the\r\ncornice, the mahogany tables, gave the room an air of sumptuous\r\ncomfort, and the leather-covered seats along the wall were soft and\r\neasy. There was a ram\xe2\x80\x99s head on a table opposite the door, and this\r\ncontained the celebrated snuff. They ordered punch. They drank it. It\r\nwas hot rum punch. The pen falters when it attempts to treat of the\r\nexcellence thereof; the sober vocabulary, the sparse epithet of this\r\nnarrative, are inadequate to the task; and pompous terms, jewelled,\r\nexotic phrases rise to the excited fancy. It warmed the blood and\r\ncleared the head; it filled the soul with well-being; it disposed the\r\nmind at once to utter wit and to appreciate the wit of others; it had\r\nthe vagueness of music and the precision of mathematics. Only one of\r\nits qualities was comparable to anything else: it had the warmth of a\r\ngood heart; but its taste, its smell, its feel, were not to be\r\ndescribed in words. Charles Lamb, with his infinite tact, attempting\r\nto, might have drawn charming pictures of the life of his day; Lord\r\nByron in a stanza of Don Juan, aiming at the impossible, might have\r\nachieved the sublime; Oscar Wilde, heaping jewels of Ispahan upon\r\nbrocades of Byzantium, might have created a troubling beauty.\r\nConsidering it, the mind reeled under visions of the feasts of\r\nElagabalus; and the subtle harmonies of Debussy mingled with the musty,\r\nfragrant romance of chests in which have been kept old clothes, ruffs,\r\nhose, doublets, of a forgotten generation, and the wan odour of lilies\r\nof the valley and the savour of Cheddar cheese.\r\n\r\nHayward discovered the tavern at which this priceless beverage was to\r\nbe obtained by meeting in the street a man called Macalister who had\r\nbeen at Cambridge with him. He was a stockbroker and a philosopher. He\r\nwas accustomed to go to the tavern once a week; and soon Philip,\r\nLawson, and Hayward got into the habit of meeting there every Tuesday\r\nevening: change of manners made it now little frequented, which was an\r\nadvantage to persons who took pleasure in conversation. Macalister was\r\na big-boned fellow, much too short for his width, with a large, fleshy\r\nface and a soft voice. He was a student of Kant and judged everything\r\nfrom the standpoint of pure reason. He was fond of expounding his\r\ndoctrines. Philip listened with excited interest. He had long come to\r\nthe conclusion that nothing amused him more than metaphysics, but he\r\nwas not so sure of their efficacy in the affairs of life. The neat\r\nlittle system which he had formed as the result of his meditations at\r\nBlackstable had not been of conspicuous use during his infatuation for\r\nMildred. He could not be positive that reason was much help in the\r\nconduct of life. It seemed to him that life lived itself. He remembered\r\nvery vividly the violence of the emotion which had possessed him and\r\nhis inability, as if he were tied down to the ground with ropes, to\r\nreact against it. He read many wise things in books, but he could only\r\njudge from his own experience (he did not know whether he was different\r\nfrom other people); he did not calculate the pros and cons of an\r\naction, the benefits which must befall him if he did it, the harm which\r\nmight result from the omission; but his whole being was urged on\r\nirresistibly. He did not act with a part of himself but altogether. The\r\npower that possessed him seemed to have nothing to do with reason: all\r\nthat reason did was to point out the methods of obtaining what his\r\nwhole soul was striving for.\r\n\r\nMacalister reminded him of the Categorical Imperative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAct so that every action of yours should be capable of becoming a\r\nuniversal rule of action for all men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seems to me perfect nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a bold man to say that of anything stated by Immanuel Kant,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nretorted Macalister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Reverence for what somebody said is a stultifying quality:\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a damned sight too much reverence in the world. Kant thought\r\nthings not because they were true, but because he was Kant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is your objection to the Categorical Imperative?\xe2\x80\x9d (They\r\ntalked as though the fate of empires were in the balance.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt suggests that one can choose one\xe2\x80\x99s course by an effort of will. And\r\nit suggests that reason is the surest guide. Why should its dictates be\r\nany better than those of passion? They\xe2\x80\x99re different. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be a contented slave of your passions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA slave because I can\xe2\x80\x99t help myself, but not a contented one,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke he thought of that hot madness which had driven him in\r\npursuit of Mildred. He remembered how he had chafed against it and how\r\nhe had felt the degradation of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, I\xe2\x80\x99m free from all that now,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nAnd yet even as he said it he was not quite sure whether he spoke\r\nsincerely. When he was under the influence of passion he had felt a\r\nsingular vigour, and his mind had worked with unwonted force. He was\r\nmore alive, there was an excitement in sheer being, an eager vehemence\r\nof soul, which made life now a trifle dull. For all the misery he had\r\nendured there was a compensation in that sense of rushing, overwhelming\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nBut Philip\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky words engaged him in a discussion on the freedom\r\nof the will, and Macalister, with his well-stored memory, brought out\r\nargument after argument. He had a mind that delighted in dialectics,\r\nand he forced Philip to contradict himself; he pushed him into corners\r\nfrom which he could only escape by damaging concessions; he tripped him\r\nup with logic and battered him with authorities.\r\n\r\nAt last Philip said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about other people. I can only speak for\r\nmyself. The illusion of free will is so strong in my mind that I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget away from it, but I believe it is only an illusion. But it is an\r\nillusion which is one of the strongest motives of my actions. Before I\r\ndo anything I feel that I have choice, and that influences what I do;\r\nbut afterwards, when the thing is done, I believe that it was\r\ninevitable from all eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you deduce from that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hayward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, merely the futility of regret. It\xe2\x80\x99s no good crying over spilt\r\nmilk, because all the forces of the universe were bent on spilling it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning Philip on getting up felt his head swim, and going back to\r\nbed suddenly discovered he was ill. All his limbs ached and he shivered\r\nwith cold. When the landlady brought in his breakfast he called to her\r\nthrough the open door that he was not well, and asked for a cup of tea\r\nand a piece of toast. A few minutes later there was a knock at his\r\ndoor, and Griffiths came in. They had lived in the same house for over\r\na year, but had never done more than nod to one another in the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re seedy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come in\r\nand see what was the matter with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, blushing he knew not why, made light of the whole thing. He\r\nwould be all right in an hour or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99d better let me take your temperature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip irritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip put the thermometer in his mouth. Griffiths sat on the side of\r\nthe bed and chatted brightly for a moment, then he took it out and\r\nlooked at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look here, old man, you must stay in bed, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring old\r\nDeacon in to have a look at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the matter. I wish you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t any bother. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a temperature and you must stay in\r\nbed. You will, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar charm in his manner, a mingling of gravity and\r\nkindliness, which was infinitely attractive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wonderful bed-side manner,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip murmured, closing his\r\neyes with a smile.\r\n\r\nGriffiths shook out his pillow for him, deftly smoothed down the\r\nbedclothes, and tucked him up. He went into Philip\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room to\r\nlook for a siphon, could not find one, and fetched it from his own\r\nroom. He drew down the blind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, go to sleep and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring the old man round as soon as he\xe2\x80\x99s done\r\nthe wards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed hours before anyone came to Philip. His head felt as if it\r\nwould split, anguish rent his limbs, and he was afraid he was going to\r\ncry. Then there was a knock at the door and Griffiths, healthy, strong,\r\nand cheerful, came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Doctor Deacon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe physician stepped forward, an elderly man with a bland manner, whom\r\nPhilip knew only by sight. A few questions, a brief examination, and\r\nthe diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you make it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Griffiths, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInfluenza.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Deacon looked round the dingy lodging-house room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to go to the hospital? They\xe2\x80\x99ll put you in a private\r\nward, and you can be better looked after than you can here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather stay where I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe did not want to be disturbed, and he was always shy of new\r\nsurroundings. He did not fancy nurses fussing about him, and the dreary\r\ncleanliness of the hospital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can look after him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote a prescription, gave instructions, and left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do exactly as I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nday-nurse and night-nurse all in one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you, but I shan\xe2\x80\x99t want anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nGriffiths put his hand on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, a large cool, dry hand,\r\nand the touch seemed to him good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just going to take this round to the dispensary to have it made\r\nup, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a little while he brought the medicine and gave Philip a dose. Then\r\nhe went upstairs to fetch his books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t mind my working in your room this afternoon, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, when he came down. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the door open so that you can give\r\nme a shout if you want anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLater in the day Philip, awaking from an uneasy doze, heard voices in\r\nhis sitting-room. A friend had come in to see Griffiths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you\xe2\x80\x99d better not come in tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard Griffiths saying.\r\n\r\nAnd then a minute or two afterwards someone else entered the room and\r\nexpressed his surprise at finding Griffiths there. Philip heard him\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m looking after a second year\xe2\x80\x99s man who\xe2\x80\x99s got these rooms. The\r\nwretched blighter\xe2\x80\x99s down with influenza. No whist tonight, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently Griffiths was left alone and Philip called him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you\xe2\x80\x99re not putting off a party tonight, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot on your account. I must work at my surgery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it off. I shall be all right. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t bother about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip grew worse. As the night came on he became slightly delirious,\r\nbut towards morning he awoke from a restless sleep. He saw Griffiths\r\nget out of an arm-chair, go down on his knees, and with his fingers put\r\npiece after piece of coal on the fire. He was in pyjamas and a\r\ndressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I wake you up? I tried to make up the fire without making a row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy aren\xe2\x80\x99t you in bed? What\xe2\x80\x99s the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout five. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d better sit up with you tonight. I brought an\r\narm-chair in as I thought if I put a mattress down I should sleep so\r\nsoundly that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you if you wanted anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so good to me,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you\r\ncatch it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you shall nurse me, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Griffiths drew up the blind. He looked pale and tired\r\nafter his night\xe2\x80\x99s watch, but was full of spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to wash you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Philip cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can wash myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, ashamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. If you were in the small ward a nurse would wash you, and I\r\ncan do it just as well as a nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, too weak and wretched to resist, allowed Griffiths to wash his\r\nhands and face, his feet, his chest and back. He did it with charming\r\ntenderness, carrying on meanwhile a stream of friendly chatter; then he\r\nchanged the sheet just as they did at the hospital, shook out the\r\npillow, and arranged the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like Sister Arthur to see me. It would make her sit up.\r\nDeacon\xe2\x80\x99s coming in to see you early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine why you should be so good to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good practice for me. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather a lark having a patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriffiths gave him his breakfast and went off to get dressed and have\r\nsomething to eat. A few minutes before ten he came back with a bunch of\r\ngrapes and a few flowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are awfully kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe was in bed for five days.\r\n\r\nNorah and Griffiths nursed him between them. Though Griffiths was the\r\nsame age as Philip he adopted towards him a humorous, motherly\r\nattitude. He was a thoughtful fellow, gentle and encouraging; but his\r\ngreatest quality was a vitality which seemed to give health to everyone\r\nwith whom he came in contact. Philip was unused to the petting which\r\nmost people enjoy from mothers or sisters and he was deeply touched by\r\nthe feminine tenderness of this strong young man. Philip grew better.\r\nThen Griffiths, sitting idly in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s room, amused him with gay\r\nstories of amorous adventure. He was a flirtatious creature, capable of\r\ncarrying on three or four affairs at a time; and his account of the\r\ndevices he was forced to in order to keep out of difficulties made\r\nexcellent hearing. He had a gift for throwing a romantic glamour over\r\neverything that happened to him. He was crippled with debts, everything\r\nhe had of any value was pawned, but he managed always to be cheerful,\r\nextravagant, and generous. He was the adventurer by nature. He loved\r\npeople of doubtful occupations and shifty purposes; and his\r\nacquaintance among the riff-raff that frequents the bars of London was\r\nenormous. Loose women, treating him as a friend, told him the troubles,\r\ndifficulties, and successes of their lives; and card-sharpers,\r\nrespecting his impecuniosity, stood him dinners and lent him five-pound\r\nnotes. He was ploughed in his examinations time after time; but he bore\r\nthis cheerfully, and submitted with such a charming grace to the\r\nparental expostulations that his father, a doctor in practice at Leeds,\r\nhad not the heart to be seriously angry with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an awful fool at books,\xe2\x80\x9d he said cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I CAN\xe2\x80\x99T work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLife was much too jolly. But it was clear that when he had got through\r\nthe exuberance of his youth, and was at last qualified, he would be a\r\ntremendous success in practice. He would cure people by the sheer charm\r\nof his manner.\r\n\r\nPhilip worshipped him as at school he had worshipped boys who were tall\r\nand straight and high of spirits. By the time he was well they were\r\nfast friends, and it was a peculiar satisfaction to Philip that\r\nGriffiths seemed to enjoy sitting in his little parlour, wasting\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s time with his amusing chatter and smoking innumerable\r\ncigarettes. Philip took him sometimes to the tavern off Regent Street.\r\nHayward found him stupid, but Lawson recognised his charm and was eager\r\nto paint him; he was a picturesque figure with his blue eyes, white\r\nskin, and curly hair. Often they discussed things he knew nothing\r\nabout, and then he sat quietly, with a good-natured smile on his\r\nhandsome face, feeling quite rightly that his presence was sufficient\r\ncontribution to the entertainment of the company. When he discovered\r\nthat Macalister was a stockbroker he was eager for tips; and\r\nMacalister, with his grave smile, told him what fortunes he could have\r\nmade if he had bought certain stock at certain times. It made Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth water, for in one way and another he was spending more than he\r\nhad expected, and it would have suited him very well to make a little\r\nmoney by the easy method Macalister suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext time I hear of a really good thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nstockbroker. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do come along sometimes. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of\r\nbiding one\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip could not help thinking how delightful it would be to make fifty\r\npounds, so that he could give Norah the furs she so badly needed for\r\nthe winter. He looked at the shops in Regent Street and picked out the\r\narticles he could buy for the money. She deserved everything. She made\r\nhis life very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when he went back to his rooms from the hospital to wash\r\nand tidy himself before going to tea as usual with Norah, as he let\r\nhimself in with his latch-key, his landlady opened the door for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lady waiting to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Philip.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised. It would only be Norah, and he had no idea what had\r\nbrought her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ave let her in, only she\xe2\x80\x99s been three times, and she\r\nseemed that upset at not finding you, so I told her she could wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed past the explaining landlady and burst into the room. His\r\nheart turned sick. It was Mildred. She was sitting down, but got up\r\nhurriedly as he came in. She did not move towards him nor speak. He was\r\nso surprised that he did not know what he was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell d\xe2\x80\x99you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but began to cry. She did not put her hands to her\r\neyes, but kept them hanging by the side of her body. She looked like a\r\nhousemaid applying for a situation. There was a dreadful humility in\r\nher bearing. Philip did not know what feelings came over him. He had a\r\nsudden impulse to turn round and escape from the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d ever see you again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was dead,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned.\r\n\r\nPhilip left her standing where she was. He could only think at the\r\nmoment of steadying himself. His knees were shaking. He looked at her,\r\nand he groaned in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s left me\xe2\x80\x94Emil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart bounded. He knew then that he loved her as passionately\r\nas ever. He had never ceased to love her. She was standing before him\r\nhumble and unresisting. He wished to take her in his arms and cover her\r\ntear-stained face with kisses. Oh, how long the separation had been! He\r\ndid not know how he could have endured it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better sit down. Let me give you a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew the chair near the fire and she sat in it. He mixed her whiskey\r\nand soda, and, sobbing still, she drank it. She looked at him with\r\ngreat, mournful eyes. There were large black lines under them. She was\r\nthinner and whiter than when last he had seen her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\xe2\x80\x99d married you when you asked me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not know why the remark seemed to swell his heart. He could\r\nnot keep the distance from her which he had forced upon himself. He put\r\nhis hand on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leaned her head against his bosom and burst into hysterical crying.\r\nHer hat was in the way and she took it off. He had never dreamt that\r\nshe was capable of crying like that. He kissed her again and again. It\r\nseemed to ease her a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were always good to me, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I knew I\r\ncould come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, breaking away from him.\r\n\r\nHe sank down on his knees beside her and put his cheek against hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me? I can never\r\nblame you for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told him the story little by little, and sometimes she sobbed so\r\nmuch that he could hardly understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast Monday week he went up to Birmingham, and he promised to be back\r\non Thursday, and he never came, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come on the Friday, so I\r\nwrote to ask what was the matter, and he never answered the letter. And\r\nI wrote and said that if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear from him by return I\xe2\x80\x99d go up to\r\nBirmingham, and this morning I got a solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s letter to say I had no\r\nclaim on him, and if I molested him he\xe2\x80\x99d seek the protection of the\r\nlaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cA man can\xe2\x80\x99t treat his wife like that.\r\nHad you had a row?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99d had a quarrel on the Sunday, and he said he was sick of\r\nme, but he\xe2\x80\x99d said it before, and he\xe2\x80\x99d come back all right. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink he meant it. He was frightened, because I told him a baby was\r\ncoming. I kept it from him as long as I could. Then I had to tell him.\r\nHe said it was my fault, and I ought to have known better. If you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nonly heard the things he said to me! But I found out precious quick\r\nthat he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman. He left me without a penny. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t paid\r\nthe rent, and I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got the money to pay it, and the woman who kept\r\nthe house said such things to me\xe2\x80\x94well, I might have been a thief the\r\nway she talked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were going to take a flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what he said, but we just took furnished apartments in\r\nHighbury. He was that mean. He said I was extravagant, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nme anything to be extravagant with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had an extraordinary way of mixing the trivial with the important.\r\nPhilip was puzzled. The whole thing was incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo man could be such a blackguard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know him. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go back to him now not if he was to\r\ncome and ask me on his bended knees. I was a fool ever to think of him.\r\nAnd he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t earning the money he said he was. The lies he told me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thought for a minute or two. He was so deeply moved by her\r\ndistress that he could not think of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to go to Birmingham? I could see him and try to make\r\nthings up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance of that. He\xe2\x80\x99ll never come back now, I know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he must provide for you. He can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nanything about these things, you\xe2\x80\x99d better go and see a solicitor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay all that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write a note to my own solicitor, the\r\nsportsman who was my father\xe2\x80\x99s executor. Would you like me to come with\r\nyou now? I expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll still be at his office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, give me a letter to him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a little calmer now. He sat down and wrote a note. Then he\r\nremembered that she had no money. He had fortunately changed a cheque\r\nthe day before and was able to give her five pounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good to me, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so happy to be able to do something for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you fond of me still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as fond as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put up her lips and he kissed her. There was a surrender in the\r\naction which he had never seen in her before. It was worth all the\r\nagony he had suffered.\r\n\r\nShe went away and he found that she had been there for two hours. He\r\nwas extraordinarily happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing, poor thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured to himself, his heart glowing\r\nwith a greater love than he had ever felt before.\r\n\r\nHe never thought of Norah at all till about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock a telegram\r\ncame. He knew before opening it that it was from her.\r\n\r\nIs anything the matter? Norah.\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to do nor what to answer. He could fetch her after\r\nthe play, in which she was walking on, was over and stroll home with\r\nher as he sometimes did; but his whole soul revolted against the idea\r\nof seeing her that evening. He thought of writing to her, but he could\r\nnot bring himself to address her as usual, dearest Norah. He made up\r\nhis mind to telegraph.\r\n\r\nSorry. Could not get away, Philip.\r\n\r\nHe visualised her. He was slightly repelled by the ugly little face,\r\nwith its high cheekbones and the crude colour. There was a coarseness\r\nin her skin which gave him goose-flesh. He knew that his telegram must\r\nbe followed by some action on his part, but at all events it postponed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNext day he wired again.\r\n\r\nRegret, unable to come. Will write.\r\n\r\nMildred had suggested coming at four in the afternoon, and he would not\r\ntell her that the hour was inconvenient. After all she came first. He\r\nwaited for her impatiently. He watched for her at the window and opened\r\nthe front-door himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Did you see Nixon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any good. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s to be done.\r\nI must just grin and bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip.\r\n\r\nShe sat down wearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he give any reasons?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a crumpled letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your letter, Philip. I never took it. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\r\nyesterday, I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Emil didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry me. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He had\r\na wife already and three children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt a sudden pang of jealousy and anguish. It was almost more\r\nthan he could bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go back to my aunt. There\xe2\x80\x99s no one I can go to\r\nbut you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you go away with him?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip asked, in a low voice which he\r\nstruggled to make firm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was a married man at first, and when he\r\ntold me I gave him a piece of my mind. And then I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him for\r\nmonths, and when he came to the shop again and asked me I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat came over me. I felt as if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I had to go with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you in love with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly help laughing at the things he said.\r\nAnd there was something about him\xe2\x80\x94he said I\xe2\x80\x99d never regret it, he\r\npromised to give me seven pounds a week\xe2\x80\x94he said he was earning fifteen,\r\nand it was all a lie, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And then I was sick of going to the\r\nshop every morning, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t getting on very well with my aunt; she\r\nwanted to treat me as a servant instead of a relation, said I ought to\r\ndo my own room, and if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it nobody was going to do it for me.\r\nOh, I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. But when he came to the shop and asked me I felt I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip moved away from her. He sat down at the table and buried his\r\nface in his hands. He felt dreadfully humiliated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not angry with me, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked piteously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, looking up but away from her, \xe2\x80\x9conly I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully\r\nhurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I was so dreadfully in love with you. I did everything I\r\ncould to make you care for me. I thought you were incapable of loving\r\nanyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s so horrible to know that you were willing to sacrifice\r\neverything for that bounder. I wonder what you saw in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, Philip. I regretted it bitterly afterwards, I\r\npromise you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought of Emil Miller, with his pasty, unhealthy look, his shifty\r\nblue eyes, and the vulgar smartness of his appearance; he always wore\r\nbright red knitted waistcoats. Philip sighed. She got up and went to\r\nhim. She put her arm round his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never forget that you offered to marry me, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and looked up at her. She bent down and kissed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, if you want me still I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything you like now. I know\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman in every sense of the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis heart stood still. Her words made him feel slightly sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully good of you, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you care for me any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I love you with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we have a good time while we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the chance? You\r\nsee, it can\xe2\x80\x99t matter now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe released himself from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sick with love for you ever since I\r\nsaw you, but now\xe2\x80\x94that man. I\xe2\x80\x99ve unfortunately got a vivid imagination.\r\nThe thought of it simply disgusts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are funny,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand again and smiled at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m not grateful. I can never thank you enough, but\r\nyou see, it\xe2\x80\x99s just stronger than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a good friend, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went on talking, and soon they had returned to the familiar\r\ncompanionship of old days. It grew late. Philip suggested that they\r\nshould dine together and go to a music-hall. She wanted some\r\npersuasion, for she had an idea of acting up to her situation, and felt\r\ninstinctively that it did not accord with her distressed condition to\r\ngo to a place of entertainment. At last Philip asked her to go simply\r\nto please him, and when she could look upon it as an act of\r\nself-sacrifice she accepted. She had a new thoughtfulness which\r\ndelighted Philip. She asked him to take her to the little restaurant in\r\nSoho to which they had so often been; he was infinitely grateful to\r\nher, because her suggestion showed that happy memories were attached to\r\nit. She grew much more cheerful as dinner proceeded. The Burgundy from\r\nthe public house at the corner warmed her heart, and she forgot that\r\nshe ought to preserve a dolorous countenance. Philip thought it safe to\r\nspeak to her of the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a brass farthing, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when\r\nan opportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly what you gave me yesterday, and I had to give the landlady three\r\npounds of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99d better give you a tenner to go on with. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see my\r\nsolicitor and get him to write to Miller. We can make him pay up\r\nsomething, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. If we can get a hundred pounds out of him it\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncarry you on till after the baby comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take a penny from him. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather starve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s monstrous that he should leave you in the lurch like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my pride to consider.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a little awkward for Philip. He needed rigid economy to make his\r\nown money last till he was qualified, and he must have something over\r\nto keep him during the year he intended to spend as house physician and\r\nhouse surgeon either at his own or at some other hospital. But Mildred\r\nhad told him various stories of Emil\xe2\x80\x99s meanness, and he was afraid to\r\nremonstrate with her in case she accused him too of want of generosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take a penny piece from him. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner beg my bread. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave seen about getting some work to do long before now, only it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good for me in the state I\xe2\x80\x99m in. You have to think of your\r\nhealth, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t bother about the present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI can let you\r\nhave all you want till you\xe2\x80\x99re fit to work again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew I could depend on you. I told Emil he needn\xe2\x80\x99t think I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot somebody to go to. I told him you was a gentleman in every sense of\r\nthe word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy degrees Philip learned how the separation had come about. It\r\nappeared that the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s wife had discovered the adventure he was\r\nengaged in during his periodical visits to London, and had gone to the\r\nhead of the firm that employed him. She threatened to divorce him, and\r\nthey announced that they would dismiss him if she did. He was\r\npassionately devoted to his children and could not bear the thought of\r\nbeing separated from them. When he had to choose between his wife and\r\nhis mistress he chose his wife. He had been always anxious that there\r\nshould be no child to make the entanglement more complicated; and when\r\nMildred, unable longer to conceal its approach, informed him of the\r\nfact, he was seized with panic. He picked a quarrel and left her\r\nwithout more ado.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen d\xe2\x80\x99you expect to be confined?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning of March.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to discuss plans. Mildred declared she would not\r\nremain in the rooms at Highbury, and Philip thought it more convenient\r\ntoo that she should be nearer to him. He promised to look for something\r\nnext day. She suggested the Vauxhall Bridge Road as a likely\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it would be near for afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should only be able to stay there about two months or a little\r\nmore, and then I should have to go into a house. I know a very\r\nrespectable place, where they have a most superior class of people, and\r\nthey take you for four guineas a week and no extras. Of course the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s extra, but that\xe2\x80\x99s all. A friend of mine went there, and the\r\nlady who keeps it is a thorough lady. I mean to tell her that my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s an officer in India and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to London for my baby,\r\nbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s better for my health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed extraordinary to Philip to hear her talking in this way. With\r\nher delicate little features and her pale face she looked cold and\r\nmaidenly. When he thought of the passions that burnt within her, so\r\nunexpected, his heart was strangely troubled. His pulse beat quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip expected to find a letter from Norah when he got back to his\r\nrooms, but there was nothing; nor did he receive one the following\r\nmorning. The silence irritated and at the same time alarmed him. They\r\nhad seen one another every day he had been in London since the previous\r\nJune; and it must seem odd to her that he should let two days go by\r\nwithout visiting her or offering a reason for his absence; he wondered\r\nwhether by an unlucky chance she had seen him with Mildred. He could\r\nnot bear to think that she was hurt or unhappy, and he made up his mind\r\nto call on her that afternoon. He was almost inclined to reproach her\r\nbecause he had allowed himself to get on such intimate terms with her.\r\nThe thought of continuing them filled him with disgust.\r\n\r\nHe found two rooms for Mildred on the second floor of a house in the\r\nVauxhall Bridge Road. They were noisy, but he knew that she liked the\r\nrattle of traffic under her windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like a dead and alive street where you don\xe2\x80\x99t see a soul pass\r\nall day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a bit of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he forced himself to go to Vincent Square. He was sick with\r\napprehension when he rang the bell. He had an uneasy sense that he was\r\ntreating Norah badly; he dreaded reproaches; he knew she had a quick\r\ntemper, and he hated scenes: perhaps the best way would be to tell her\r\nfrankly that Mildred had come back to him and his love for her was as\r\nviolent as it had ever been; he was very sorry, but he had nothing to\r\noffer Norah any more. Then he thought of her anguish, for he knew she\r\nloved him; it had flattered him before, and he was immensely grateful;\r\nbut now it was horrible. She had not deserved that he should inflict\r\npain upon her. He asked himself how she would greet him now, and as he\r\nwalked up the stairs all possible forms of her behaviour flashed across\r\nhis mind. He knocked at the door. He felt that he was pale, and\r\nwondered how to conceal his nervousness.\r\n\r\nShe was writing away industriously, but she sprang to her feet as he\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recognised your step,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been hiding\r\nyourself, you naughty boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came towards him joyfully and put her arms round his neck. She was\r\ndelighted to see him. He kissed her, and then, to give himself\r\ncountenance, said he was dying for tea. She bustled the fire to make\r\nthe kettle boil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been awfully busy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said lamely.\r\n\r\nShe began to chatter in her bright way, telling him of a new commission\r\nshe had to provide a novelette for a firm which had not hitherto\r\nemployed her. She was to get fifteen guineas for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s money from the clouds. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do, we\xe2\x80\x99ll stand\r\nourselves a little jaunt. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go and spend a day at Oxford, shall we?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d love to see the colleges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her to see whether there was any shadow of reproach in her\r\neyes; but they were as frank and merry as ever: she was overjoyed to\r\nsee him. His heart sank. He could not tell her the brutal truth. She\r\nmade some toast for him, and cut it into little pieces, and gave it him\r\nas though he were a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the brute fed?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded, smiling; and she lit a cigarette for him. Then, as she loved\r\nto do, she came and sat on his knees. She was very light. She leaned\r\nback in his arms with a sigh of delicious happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay something nice to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might by an effort of imagination say that you rather liked me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not the heart to tell her then. He would give her peace at all\r\nevents for that day, and perhaps he might write to her. That would be\r\neasier. He could not bear to think of her crying. She made him kiss\r\nher, and as he kissed her he thought of Mildred and Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s pale,\r\nthin lips. The recollection of Mildred remained with him all the time,\r\nlike an incorporated form, but more substantial than a shadow; and the\r\nsight continually distracted his attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very quiet today,\xe2\x80\x9d Norah said.\r\n\r\nHer loquacity was a standing joke between them, and he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never let me get a word in, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got out of the habit of\r\ntalking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re not listening, and that\xe2\x80\x99s bad manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reddened a little, wondering whether she had some inkling of his\r\nsecret; he turned away his eyes uneasily. The weight of her irked him\r\nthis afternoon, and he did not want her to touch him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy foot\xe2\x80\x99s gone to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, jumping up. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to bant if I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbreak myself of this habit of sitting on gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s knees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went through an elaborate form of stamping his foot and walking\r\nabout. Then he stood in front of the fire so that she should not resume\r\nher position. While she talked he thought that she was worth ten of\r\nMildred; she amused him much more and was jollier to talk to; she was\r\ncleverer, and she had a much nicer nature. She was a good, brave,\r\nhonest little woman; and Mildred, he thought bitterly, deserved none of\r\nthese epithets. If he had any sense he would stick to Norah, she would\r\nmake him much happier than he would ever be with Mildred: after all she\r\nloved him, and Mildred was only grateful for his help. But when all was\r\nsaid the important thing was to love rather than to be loved; and he\r\nyearned for Mildred with his whole soul. He would sooner have ten\r\nminutes with her than a whole afternoon with Norah, he prized one kiss\r\nof her cold lips more than all Norah could give him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just got her in my bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not care if she was heartless, vicious and vulgar, stupid and\r\ngrasping, he loved her. He would rather have misery with the one than\r\nhappiness with the other.\r\n\r\nWhen he got up to go Norah said casually:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall see you tomorrow, shan\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he would not be able to come, since he was going to help\r\nMildred with her moving, but he had not the courage to say so. He made\r\nup his mind that he would send a wire. Mildred saw the rooms in the\r\nmorning, was satisfied with them, and after luncheon Philip went up\r\nwith her to Highbury. She had a trunk for her clothes and another for\r\nthe various odds and ends, cushions, lampshades, photograph frames,\r\nwith which she had tried to give the apartments a home-like air; she\r\nhad two or three large cardboard boxes besides, but in all there was no\r\nmore than could be put on the roof of a four-wheeler. As they drove\r\nthrough Victoria Street Philip sat well back in the cab in case Norah\r\nshould happen to be passing. He had not had an opportunity to telegraph\r\nand could not do so from the post office in the Vauxhall Bridge Road,\r\nsince she would wonder what he was doing in that neighbourhood; and if\r\nhe was there he could have no excuse for not going into the\r\nneighbouring square where she lived. He made up his mind that he had\r\nbetter go in and see her for half an hour; but the necessity irritated\r\nhim: he was angry with Norah, because she forced him to vulgar and\r\ndegrading shifts. But he was happy to be with Mildred. It amused him to\r\nhelp her with the unpacking; and he experienced a charming sense of\r\npossession in installing her in these lodgings which he had found and\r\nwas paying for. He would not let her exert herself. It was a pleasure\r\nto do things for her, and she had no desire to do what somebody else\r\nseemed desirous to do for her. He unpacked her clothes and put them\r\naway. She was not proposing to go out again, so he got her slippers and\r\ntook off her boots. It delighted him to perform menial offices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do spoil me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, running her fingers affectionately through\r\nhis hair, while he was on his knees unbuttoning her boots.\r\n\r\nHe took her hands and kissed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nipping to have you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe arranged the cushions and the photograph frames. She had several\r\njars of green earthenware.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get you some flowers for them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe looked round at his work proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I\xe2\x80\x99m not going out any more I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll get into a tea-gown,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cUndo me behind, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round as unconcernedly as though he were a woman. His sex\r\nmeant nothing to her. But his heart was filled with gratitude for the\r\nintimacy her request showed. He undid the hooks and eyes with clumsy\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat first day I came into the shop I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d be doing this\r\nfor you now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a laugh which he forced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody must do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nShe went into the bed-room and slipped into a pale blue tea-gown\r\ndecorated with a great deal of cheap lace. Then Philip settled her on a\r\nsofa and made tea for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay and have it with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said regretfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a beastly appointment. But I shall be back in half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered what he should say if she asked him what the appointment\r\nwas, but she showed no curiosity. He had ordered dinner for the two of\r\nthem when he took the rooms, and proposed to spend the evening with her\r\nquietly. He was in such a hurry to get back that he took a tram along\r\nthe Vauxhall Bridge Road. He thought he had better break the fact to\r\nNorah at once that he could not stay more than a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got only just time to say how d\xe2\x80\x99you do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as soon\r\nas he got into her rooms. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m frightfully busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt exasperated him that she should force him to tell lies, and he knew\r\nthat he reddened when he answered that there was a demonstration at the\r\nhospital which he was bound to go to. He fancied that she looked as\r\nthough she did not believe him, and this irritated him all the more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have you all\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her blankly. It was Sunday, and he had been looking\r\nforward to spending the day with Mildred. He told himself that he must\r\ndo that in common decency; he could not leave her by herself in a\r\nstrange house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew this was the beginning of a scene which he would have given\r\nanything to avoid. The colour on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks grew brighter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the Gordons to lunch\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94they were an actor and his wife\r\nwho were touring the provinces and in London for Sunday\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI told you\r\nabout it a week ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, I forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossibly come. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there somebody else you can get?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing tomorrow then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cross-examine me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least mind telling you, but it\xe2\x80\x99s rather annoying to be\r\nforced to account for all one\xe2\x80\x99s movements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah suddenly changed. With an effort of self-control she got the\r\nbetter of her temper, and going up to him took his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint me tomorrow, Philip, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking forward so\r\nmuch to spending the day with you. The Gordons want to see you, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have such a jolly time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to if I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not very exacting, am I? I don\xe2\x80\x99t often ask you to do anything\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a bother. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you get out of your horrid engagement\xe2\x80\x94just this\r\nonce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I can,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said coaxingly.\r\n\r\nHe had had time to invent something. \xe2\x80\x9cGriffiths\xe2\x80\x99 two sisters are up for\r\nthe week-end and we\xe2\x80\x99re taking them out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d she said joyfully. \xe2\x80\x9cGriffiths can so easily get another\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wished he had thought of something more urgent than that. It was a\r\nclumsy lie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve promised and I mean to keep my\r\npromise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you promised me too. Surely I come first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t persist,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe flared up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t come because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen doing the last few days, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be going,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t come tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case you needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble to come again,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, losing her\r\ntemper for good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me detain you any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d she added ironically.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders and walked out. He was relieved that it had\r\ngone no worse. There had been no tears. As he walked along he\r\ncongratulated himself on getting out of the affair so easily. He went\r\ninto Victoria Street and bought a few flowers to take in to Mildred.\r\n\r\nThe little dinner was a great success. Philip had sent in a small pot\r\nof caviare, which he knew she was very fond of, and the landlady\r\nbrought them up some cutlets with vegetables and a sweet. Philip had\r\nordered Burgundy, which was her favourite wine. With the curtains\r\ndrawn, a bright fire, and one of Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s shades on the lamp, the room\r\nwas cosy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really just like home,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might be worse off, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nWhen they finished, Philip drew two arm-chairs in front of the fire,\r\nand they sat down. He smoked his pipe comfortably. He felt happy and\r\ngenerous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you like to do tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Tulse Hill. You remember the manageress at the shop,\r\nwell, she\xe2\x80\x99s married now, and she\xe2\x80\x99s asked me to go and spend the day\r\nwith her. Of course she thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m married too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I refused an invitation so that I might spend Sunday with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought that if she loved him she would say that in that case she\r\nwould stay with him. He knew very well that Norah would not have\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you were a silly to do that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve promised to go for three weeks\r\nand more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can you go alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall say that Emil\xe2\x80\x99s away on business. Her husband\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nglove trade, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a very superior fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent, and bitter feelings passed through his heart. She\r\ngave him a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t grudge me a little pleasure, Philip? You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s the last\r\ntime I shall be able to go anywhere for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long, and I\r\nhad promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, darling, I want you to have the best time you can. I only want you\r\nto be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little book bound in blue paper lying open, face downwards,\r\non the sofa, and Philip idly took it up. It was a twopenny novelette,\r\nand the author was Courtenay Paget. That was the name under which Norah\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do like his books,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred. \xe2\x80\x9cI read them all. They\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nrefined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remembered what Norah had said of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an immense popularity among kitchen-maids. They think me so\r\ngenteel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip, in return for Griffiths\xe2\x80\x99 confidences, had told him the details\r\nof his own complicated amours, and on Sunday morning, after breakfast\r\nwhen they sat by the fire in their dressing-gowns and smoked, he\r\nrecounted the scene of the previous day. Griffiths congratulated him\r\nbecause he had got out of his difficulties so easily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the simplest thing in the world to have an affair with a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe remarked sententiously, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s a devil of a nuisance to get out\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt a little inclined to pat himself on the back for his skill\r\nin managing the business. At all events he was immensely relieved. He\r\nthought of Mildred enjoying herself in Tulse Hill, and he found in\r\nhimself a real satisfaction because she was happy. It was an act of\r\nself-sacrifice on his part that he did not grudge her pleasure even\r\nthough paid for by his own disappointment, and it filled his heart with\r\na comfortable glow.\r\n\r\nBut on Monday morning he found on his table a letter from Norah. She\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\nDearest,\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I was cross on Saturday. Forgive me and come to tea in the\r\nafternoon as usual. I love you.\r\n\r\nYour Norah.\r\n\r\nHis heart sank, and he did not know what to do. He took the note to\r\nGriffiths and showed it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better leave it unanswered,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be miserable if I thought of her\r\nwaiting and waiting. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is to be sick for the\r\npostman\xe2\x80\x99s knock. I do, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t expose anybody else to that\r\ntorture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, one can\xe2\x80\x99t break that sort of affair off without\r\nsomebody suffering. You must just set your teeth to that. One thing is,\r\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t last very long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt that Norah had not deserved that he should make her suffer;\r\nand what did Griffiths know about the degrees of anguish she was\r\ncapable of? He remembered his own pain when Mildred had told him she\r\nwas going to be married. He did not want anyone to experience what he\r\nhad experienced then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re so anxious not to give her pain, go back to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGriffiths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up and walked up and down the room nervously. He was angry with\r\nNorah because she had not let the matter rest. She must have seen that\r\nhe had no more love to give her. They said women were so quick at\r\nseeing those things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might help me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Griffiths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, don\xe2\x80\x99t make such a fuss about it. People do get over\r\nthese things, you know. She probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t so wrapped up in you as you\r\nthink, either. One\xe2\x80\x99s always rather apt to exaggerate the passion one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninspired other people with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked at Philip with amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing you can do. Write to her, and tell\r\nher the thing\xe2\x80\x99s over. Put it so that there can be no mistake about it.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt her, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt her less if you do the thing brutally\r\nthan if you try half-hearted ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip sat down and wrote the following letter:\r\n\r\nMy dear Norah,\r\n\r\nI am sorry to make you unhappy, but I think we had better let things\r\nremain where we left them on Saturday. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any use in\r\nletting these things drag on when they\xe2\x80\x99ve ceased to be amusing. You\r\ntold me to go and I went. I do not propose to come back. Good-bye.\r\nPhilip Carey.\r\n\r\nHe showed the letter to Griffiths and asked him what he thought of it.\r\nGriffiths read it and looked at Philip with twinkling eyes. He did not\r\nsay what he felt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99ll do the trick,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPhilip went out and posted it. He passed an uncomfortable morning, for\r\nhe imagined with great detail what Norah would feel when she received\r\nhis letter. He tortured himself with the thought of her tears. But at\r\nthe same time he was relieved. Imagined grief was more easy to bear\r\nthan grief seen, and he was free now to love Mildred with all his soul.\r\nHis heart leaped at the thought of going to see her that afternoon,\r\nwhen his day\xe2\x80\x99s work at the hospital was over.\r\n\r\nWhen as usual he went back to his rooms to tidy himself, he had no\r\nsooner put the latch-key in his door than he heard a voice behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for you for half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Norah. He felt himself blush to the roots of his hair. She spoke\r\ngaily. There was no trace of resentment in her voice and nothing to\r\nindicate that there was a rupture between them. He felt himself\r\ncornered. He was sick with fear, but he did his best to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, and she preceded him into his sitting-room. He was\r\nnervous and, to give himself countenance, offered her a cigarette and\r\nlit one for himself. She looked at him brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy? If I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntaken it seriously it would have made me perfectly wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was meant seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so silly. I lost my temper the other day, and I wrote and\r\napologised. You weren\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve come here to apologise\r\nagain. After all, you\xe2\x80\x99re your own master and I have no claims upon you.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do anything you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up from the chair in which she was sitting and went towards him\r\nimpulsively, with outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s make friends again, Philip. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry if I offended you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not prevent her from taking his hands, but he could not look\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s too late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe let herself down on the floor by his side and clasped his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. I\xe2\x80\x99m quick-tempered too and I can understand\r\nthat I hurt you, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so stupid to sulk over it. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of\r\nmaking us both unhappy? It\xe2\x80\x99s been so jolly, our friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d She passed\r\nher fingers slowly over his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up, disengaging himself from her, and went to the other side of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. The whole thing\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were just looking for an opportunity to throw me over and you took\r\nthat one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer. She looked at him steadily for a time which seemed\r\nintolerable. She was sitting on the floor where he had left her,\r\nleaning against the arm-chair. She began to cry quite silently, without\r\ntrying to hide her face, and the large tears rolled down her cheeks one\r\nafter the other. She did not sob. It was horribly painful to see her.\r\nPhilip turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry to hurt you. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault if I don\xe2\x80\x99t love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. She merely sat there, as though she were\r\noverwhelmed, and the tears flowed down her cheeks. It would have been\r\neasier to bear if she had reproached him. He had thought her temper\r\nwould get the better of her, and he was prepared for that. At the back\r\nof his mind was a feeling that a real quarrel, in which each said to\r\nthe other cruel things, would in some way be a justification of his\r\nbehaviour. The time passed. At last he grew frightened by her silent\r\ncrying; he went into his bed-room and got a glass of water; he leaned\r\nover her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you drink a little? It\xe2\x80\x99ll relieve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her lips listlessly to the glass and drank two or three\r\nmouthfuls. Then in an exhausted whisper she asked him for a\r\nhandkerchief. She dried her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I knew you never loved me as much as I loved you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmoaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that\xe2\x80\x99s always the case,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always one who\r\nloves and one who lets himself be loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought of Mildred, and a bitter pain traversed his heart. Norah did\r\nnot answer for a long time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d been so miserably unhappy, and my life was so hateful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nShe did not speak to him, but to herself. He had never heard her before\r\ncomplain of the life she had led with her husband or of her poverty. He\r\nhad always admired the bold front she displayed to the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you came along and you were so good to me. And I admired you\r\nbecause you were clever and it was so heavenly to have someone I could\r\nput my trust in. I loved you. I never thought it could come to an end.\r\nAnd without any fault of mine at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tears began to flow again, but now she was more mistress of\r\nherself, and she hid her face in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchief. She tried hard\r\nto control herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me some more water,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe wiped her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to make such a fool of myself. I was so unprepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, Norah. I want you to know that I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful\r\nfor all you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered what it was she saw in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s always the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cif you want men to behave well\r\nto you, you must be beastly to them; if you treat them decently they\r\nmake you suffer for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up from the floor and said she must go. She gave Philip a long,\r\nsteady look. Then she sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so inexplicable. What does it all mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip took a sudden determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d better tell you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to think too badly of\r\nme, I want you to see that I can\xe2\x80\x99t help myself. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colour came to her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me at once? I deserved that surely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at herself in the glass and set her hat straight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you call me a cab,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel I can walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to the door and stopped a passing hansom; but when she followed\r\nhim into the street he was startled to see how white she was. There was\r\na heaviness in her movements as though she had suddenly grown older.\r\nShe looked so ill that he had not the heart to let her go alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll drive back with you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, and he got into the cab. They drove along in\r\nsilence over the bridge, through shabby streets in which children, with\r\nshrill cries, played in the road. When they arrived at her door she did\r\nnot immediately get out. It seemed as though she could not summon\r\nenough strength to her legs to move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me, Norah,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes towards him, and he saw that they were bright again\r\nwith tears, but she forced a smile to her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow, you\xe2\x80\x99re quite worried about me. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t bother. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t blame you. I shall get over it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLightly and quickly she stroked his face to show him that she bore no\r\nill-feeling, the gesture was scarcely more than suggested; then she\r\njumped out of the cab and let herself into her house.\r\n\r\nPhilip paid the hansom and walked to Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings. There was a\r\ncurious heaviness in his heart. He was inclined to reproach himself.\r\nBut why? He did not know what else he could have done. Passing a\r\nfruiterer\xe2\x80\x99s, he remembered that Mildred was fond of grapes. He was so\r\ngrateful that he could show his love for her by recollecting every whim\r\nshe had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the next three months Philip went every day to see Mildred. He took\r\nhis books with him and after tea worked, while Mildred lay on the sofa\r\nreading novels. Sometimes he would look up and watch her for a minute.\r\nA happy smile crossed his lips. She would feel his eyes upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time looking at me, silly. Go on with your work,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTyrant,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered gaily.\r\n\r\nHe put aside his book when the landlady came in to lay the cloth for\r\ndinner, and in his high spirits he exchanged chaff with her. She was a\r\nlittle cockney, of middle age, with an amusing humour and a quick\r\ntongue. Mildred had become great friends with her and had given her an\r\nelaborate but mendacious account of the circumstances which had brought\r\nher to the pass she was in. The good-hearted little woman was touched\r\nand found no trouble too great to make Mildred comfortable. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsense of propriety had suggested that Philip should pass himself off as\r\nher brother. They dined together, and Philip was delighted when he had\r\nordered something which tempted Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s capricious appetite. It\r\nenchanted him to see her sitting opposite him, and every now and then\r\nfrom sheer joy he took her hand and pressed it. After dinner she sat in\r\nthe arm-chair by the fire, and he settled himself down on the floor\r\nbeside her, leaning against her knees, and smoked. Often they did not\r\ntalk at all, and sometimes Philip noticed that she had fallen into a\r\ndoze. He dared not move then in case he woke her, and he sat very\r\nquietly, looking lazily into the fire and enjoying his happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad a nice little nap?\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled, when she woke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not been sleeping,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI only just closed my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would never acknowledge that she had been asleep. She had a\r\nphlegmatic temperament, and her condition did not seriously\r\ninconvenience her. She took a lot of trouble about her health and\r\naccepted the advice of anyone who chose to offer it. She went for a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98constitutional\xe2\x80\x99 every morning that it was fine and remained out a\r\ndefinite time. When it was not too cold she sat in St. James\xe2\x80\x99 Park. But\r\nthe rest of the day she spent quite happily on her sofa, reading one\r\nnovel after another or chatting with the landlady; she had an\r\ninexhaustible interest in gossip, and told Philip with abundant detail\r\nthe history of the landlady, of the lodgers on the drawing-room floor,\r\nand of the people who lived in the next house on either side. Now and\r\nthen she was seized with panic; she poured out her fears to Philip\r\nabout the pain of the confinement and was in terror lest she should\r\ndie; she gave him a full account of the confinements of the landlady\r\nand of the lady on the drawing-room floor (Mildred did not know her;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m one to keep myself to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not one to go about\r\nwith anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d) and she narrated details with a queer mixture of horror\r\nand gusto; but for the most part she looked forward to the occurrence\r\nwith equanimity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the first one to have a baby, am I? And the doctor\r\nsays I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have any trouble. You see, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t well\r\nmade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Owen, the owner of the house she was going to when her time came,\r\nhad recommended a doctor, and Mildred saw him once a week. He was to\r\ncharge fifteen guineas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I could have got it done cheaper, but Mrs. Owen strongly\r\nrecommended him, and I thought it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth while to spoil the ship\r\nfor a coat of tar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you feel happy and comfortable I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a bit about the\r\nexpense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nShe accepted all that Philip did for her as if it were the most natural\r\nthing in the world, and on his side he loved to spend money on her:\r\neach five-pound note he gave her caused him a little thrill of\r\nhappiness and pride; he gave her a good many, for she was not\r\neconomical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the money goes to,\xe2\x80\x9d she said herself, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to\r\nslip through my fingers like water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad to be able to do\r\nanything I can for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not sew well and so did not make the necessary things for the\r\nbaby; she told Philip it was much cheaper in the end to buy them.\r\nPhilip had lately sold one of the mortgages in which his money had been\r\nput; and now, with five hundred pounds in the bank waiting to be\r\ninvested in something that could be more easily realised, he felt\r\nhimself uncommonly well-to-do. They talked often of the future. Philip\r\nwas anxious that Mildred should keep the child with her, but she\r\nrefused: she had her living to earn, and it would be more easy to do\r\nthis if she had not also to look after a baby. Her plan was to get back\r\ninto one of the shops of the company for which she had worked before,\r\nand the child could be put with some decent woman in the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can find someone who\xe2\x80\x99ll look after it well for seven and sixpence a\r\nweek. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be better for the baby and better for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed callous to Philip, but when he tried to reason with her she\r\npretended to think he was concerned with the expense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t ask YOU to pay for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how much I pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of her heart was the hope that the child would be\r\nstill-born. She did no more than hint it, but Philip saw that the\r\nthought was there. He was shocked at first; and then, reasoning with\r\nhimself, he was obliged to confess that for all concerned such an event\r\nwas to be desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine to say this and that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mildred remarked\r\nquerulously, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s jolly difficult for a girl to earn her living by\r\nherself; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it any easier when she\xe2\x80\x99s got a baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately you\xe2\x80\x99ve got me to fall back on,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Philip, taking her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been good to me, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what rot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t say I didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer anything in return for what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a return. If I\xe2\x80\x99ve done anything for you,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it because I love you. You owe me nothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you\r\nto do anything unless you love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a little horrified by her feeling that her body was a commodity\r\nwhich she could deliver indifferently as an acknowledgment for services\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do want to, Philip. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been so good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt for waiting. When you\xe2\x80\x99re all right again we\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nfor our little honeymoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are naughty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling.\r\n\r\nMildred expected to be confined early in March, and as soon as she was\r\nwell enough she was to go to the seaside for a fortnight: that would\r\ngive Philip a chance to work without interruption for his examination;\r\nafter that came the Easter holidays, and they had arranged to go to\r\nParis together. Philip talked endlessly of the things they would do.\r\nParis was delightful then. They would take a room in a little hotel he\r\nknew in the Latin Quarter, and they would eat in all sorts of charming\r\nlittle restaurants; they would go to the play, and he would take her to\r\nmusic halls. It would amuse her to meet his friends. He had talked to\r\nher about Cronshaw, she would see him; and there was Lawson, he had\r\ngone to Paris for a couple of months; and they would go to the Bal\r\nBullier; there were excursions; they would make trips to Versailles,\r\nChartres, Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll cost a lot of money,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, damn the expense. Think how I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking forward to it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou know what it means to me? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never loved anyone but you. I never\r\nshall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe listened to his enthusiasm with smiling eyes. He thought he saw in\r\nthem a new tenderness, and he was grateful to her. She was much gentler\r\nthan she used to be. There was in her no longer the superciliousness\r\nwhich had irritated him. She was so accustomed to him now that she took\r\nno pains to keep up before him any pretences. She no longer troubled to\r\ndo her hair with the old elaboration, but just tied it in a knot; and\r\nshe left off the vast fringe which she generally wore: the more\r\ncareless style suited her. Her face was so thin that it made her eyes\r\nseem very large; there were heavy lines under them, and the pallor of\r\nher cheeks made their colour more profound. She had a wistful look\r\nwhich was infinitely pathetic. There seemed to Philip to be in her\r\nsomething of the Madonna. He wished they could continue in that same\r\nway always. He was happier than he had ever been in his life.\r\n\r\nHe used to leave her at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock every night, for she liked to go to\r\nbed early, and he was obliged to put in another couple of hours\xe2\x80\x99 work\r\nto make up for the lost evening. He generally brushed her hair for her\r\nbefore he went. He had made a ritual of the kisses he gave her when he\r\nbade her good-night; first he kissed the palms of her hands (how thin\r\nthe fingers were, the nails were beautiful, for she spent much time in\r\nmanicuring them,) then he kissed her closed eyes, first the right one\r\nand then the left, and at last he kissed her lips. He went home with a\r\nheart overflowing with love. He longed for an opportunity to gratify\r\nthe desire for self-sacrifice which consumed him.\r\n\r\nPresently the time came for her to move to the nursing-home where she\r\nwas to be confined. Philip was then able to visit her only in the\r\nafternoons. Mildred changed her story and represented herself as the\r\nwife of a soldier who had gone to India to join his regiment, and\r\nPhilip was introduced to the mistress of the establishment as her\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to be rather careful what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him, \xe2\x80\x9cas there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother lady here whose husband\xe2\x80\x99s in the Indian Civil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let that disturb me if I were you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nconvinced that her husband and yours went out on the same boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat boat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Flying Dutchman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred was safely delivered of a daughter, and when Philip was allowed\r\nto see her the child was lying by her side. Mildred was very weak, but\r\nrelieved that everything was over. She showed him the baby, and herself\r\nlooked at it curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a funny-looking little thing, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was red and wrinkled and odd. Philip smiled when he looked at it. He\r\ndid not quite know what to say; and it embarrassed him because the\r\nnurse who owned the house was standing by his side; and he felt by the\r\nway she was looking at him that, disbelieving Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s complicated\r\nstory, she thought he was the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to call her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make up my mind if I shall call her Madeleine or Cecilia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse left them alone for a few minutes, and Philip bent down and\r\nkissed Mildred on the mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad it\xe2\x80\x99s all over happily, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her thin arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been a brick to me, Phil dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I feel that you\xe2\x80\x99re mine at last. I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited so long for you, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey heard the nurse at the door, and Philip hurriedly got up. The\r\nnurse entered. There was a slight smile on her lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThree weeks later Philip saw Mildred and her baby off to Brighton. She\r\nhad made a quick recovery and looked better than he had ever seen her.\r\nShe was going to a boarding-house where she had spent a couple of\r\nweekends with Emil Miller, and had written to say that her husband was\r\nobliged to go to Germany on business and she was coming down with her\r\nbaby. She got pleasure out of the stories she invented, and she showed\r\na certain fertility of invention in the working out of the details.\r\nMildred proposed to find in Brighton some woman who would be willing to\r\ntake charge of the baby. Philip was startled at the callousness with\r\nwhich she insisted on getting rid of it so soon, but she argued with\r\ncommon sense that the poor child had much better be put somewhere\r\nbefore it grew used to her. Philip had expected the maternal instinct\r\nto make itself felt when she had had the baby two or three weeks and\r\nhad counted on this to help him persuade her to keep it; but nothing of\r\nthe sort occurred. Mildred was not unkind to her baby; she did all that\r\nwas necessary; it amused her sometimes, and she talked about it a good\r\ndeal; but at heart she was indifferent to it. She could not look upon\r\nit as part of herself. She fancied it resembled its father already. She\r\nwas continually wondering how she would manage when it grew older; and\r\nshe was exasperated with herself for being such a fool as to have it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d only known then all I do now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe laughed at Philip, because he was anxious about its welfare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make more fuss if you was the father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to see Emil getting into such a stew about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s mind was full of the stories he had heard of baby-farming and\r\nthe ghouls who ill-treat the wretched children that selfish, cruel\r\nparents have put in their charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so silly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s when you give a woman a sum\r\ndown to look after a baby. But when you\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay so much a week\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s to their interest to look after it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip insisted that Mildred should place the child with people who had\r\nno children of their own and would promise to take no other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t haggle about the price,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather pay half a guinea\r\na week than run any risk of the kid being starved or beaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a funny old thing, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\nTo him there was something very touching in the child\xe2\x80\x99s helplessness.\r\nIt was small, ugly, and querulous. Its birth had been looked forward to\r\nwith shame and anguish. Nobody wanted it. It was dependent on him, a\r\nstranger, for food, shelter, and clothes to cover its nakedness.\r\n\r\nAs the train started he kissed Mildred. He would have kissed the baby\r\ntoo, but he was afraid she would laugh at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will write to me, darling, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? And I shall look forward to\r\nyour coming back with oh! such impatience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you get through your exam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been working for it industriously, and now with only ten days\r\nbefore him he made a final effort. He was very anxious to pass, first\r\nto save himself time and expense, for money had been slipping through\r\nhis fingers during the last four months with incredible speed; and then\r\nbecause this examination marked the end of the drudgery: after that the\r\nstudent had to do with medicine, midwifery, and surgery, the interest\r\nof which was more vivid than the anatomy and physiology with which he\r\nhad been hitherto concerned. Philip looked forward with interest to the\r\nrest of the curriculum. Nor did he want to have to confess to Mildred\r\nthat he had failed: though the examination was difficult and the\r\nmajority of candidates were ploughed at the first attempt, he knew that\r\nshe would think less well of him if he did not succeed; she had a\r\npeculiarly humiliating way of showing what she thought.\r\n\r\nMildred sent him a postcard to announce her safe arrival, and he\r\nsnatched half an hour every day to write a long letter to her. He had\r\nalways a certain shyness in expressing himself by word of mouth, but he\r\nfound he could tell her, pen in hand, all sorts of things which it\r\nwould have made him feel ridiculous to say. Profiting by the discovery\r\nhe poured out to her his whole heart. He had never been able to tell\r\nher before how his adoration filled every part of him so that all his\r\nactions, all his thoughts, were touched with it. He wrote to her of the\r\nfuture, the happiness that lay before him, and the gratitude which he\r\nowed her. He asked himself (he had often asked himself before but had\r\nnever put it into words) what it was in her that filled him with such\r\nextravagant delight; he did not know; he knew only that when she was\r\nwith him he was happy, and when she was away from him the world was on\r\na sudden cold and gray; he knew only that when he thought of her his\r\nheart seemed to grow big in his body so that it was difficult to\r\nbreathe (as if it pressed against his lungs) and it throbbed, so that\r\nthe delight of her presence was almost pain; his knees shook, and he\r\nfelt strangely weak as though, not having eaten, he were tremulous from\r\nwant of food. He looked forward eagerly to her answers. He did not\r\nexpect her to write often, for he knew that letter-writing came\r\ndifficultly to her; and he was quite content with the clumsy little\r\nnote that arrived in reply to four of his. She spoke of the\r\nboarding-house in which she had taken a room, of the weather and the\r\nbaby, told him she had been for a walk on the front with a lady-friend\r\nwhom she had met in the boarding-house and who had taken such a fancy\r\nto baby, she was going to the theatre on Saturday night, and Brighton\r\nwas filling up. It touched Philip because it was so matter-of-fact. The\r\ncrabbed style, the formality of the matter, gave him a queer desire to\r\nlaugh and to take her in his arms and kiss her.\r\n\r\nHe went into the examination with happy confidence. There was nothing\r\nin either of the papers that gave him trouble. He knew that he had done\r\nwell, and though the second part of the examination was viva voce and\r\nhe was more nervous, he managed to answer the questions adequately. He\r\nsent a triumphant telegram to Mildred when the result was announced.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to his rooms Philip found a letter from her, saying\r\nthat she thought it would be better for her to stay another week in\r\nBrighton. She had found a woman who would be glad to take the baby for\r\nseven shillings a week, but she wanted to make inquiries about her, and\r\nshe was herself benefiting so much by the sea-air that she was sure a\r\nfew days more would do her no end of good. She hated asking Philip for\r\nmoney, but would he send some by return, as she had had to buy herself\r\na new hat, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go about with her lady-friend always in the\r\nsame hat, and her lady-friend was so dressy. Philip had a moment of\r\nbitter disappointment. It took away all his pleasure at getting through\r\nhis examination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she loved me one quarter as much as I love her she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to\r\nstay away a day longer than necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put the thought away from him quickly; it was pure selfishness; of\r\ncourse her health was more important than anything else. But he had\r\nnothing to do now; he might spend the week with her in Brighton, and\r\nthey could be together all day. His heart leaped at the thought. It\r\nwould be amusing to appear before Mildred suddenly with the information\r\nthat he had taken a room in the boarding-house. He looked out trains.\r\nBut he paused. He was not certain that she would be pleased to see him;\r\nshe had made friends in Brighton; he was quiet, and she liked\r\nboisterous joviality; he realised that she amused herself more with\r\nother people than with him. It would torture him if he felt for an\r\ninstant that he was in the way. He was afraid to risk it. He dared not\r\neven write and suggest that, with nothing to keep him in town, he would\r\nlike to spend the week where he could see her every day. She knew he\r\nhad nothing to do; if she wanted him to come she would have asked him\r\nto. He dared not risk the anguish he would suffer if he proposed to\r\ncome and she made excuses to prevent him.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to her next day, sent her a five-pound note, and at the end of\r\nhis letter said that if she were very nice and cared to see him for the\r\nweek-end he would be glad to run down; but she was by no means to alter\r\nany plans she had made. He awaited her answer with impatience. In it\r\nshe said that if she had only known before she could have arranged it,\r\nbut she had promised to go to a music-hall on the Saturday night;\r\nbesides, it would make the people at the boarding-house talk if he\r\nstayed there. Why did he not come on Sunday morning and spend the day?\r\nThey could lunch at the Metropole, and she would take him afterwards to\r\nsee the very superior lady-like person who was going to take the baby.\r\n\r\nSunday. He blessed the day because it was fine. As the train approached\r\nBrighton the sun poured through the carriage window. Mildred was\r\nwaiting for him on the platform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow jolly of you to come and meet me!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, as he seized her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou expected me, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped you would. I say, how well you\xe2\x80\x99re looking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s done me a rare lot of good, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m wise to stay here as\r\nlong as I can. And there are a very nice class of people at the\r\nboarding-house. I wanted cheering up after seeing nobody all these\r\nmonths. It was dull sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked very smart in her new hat, a large black straw with a great\r\nmany inexpensive flowers on it; and round her neck floated a long boa\r\nof imitation swansdown. She was still very thin, and she stooped a\r\nlittle when she walked (she had always done that,) but her eyes did not\r\nseem so large; and though she never had any colour, her skin had lost\r\nthe earthy look it had. They walked down to the sea. Philip,\r\nremembering he had not walked with her for months, grew suddenly\r\nconscious of his limp and walked stiffly in the attempt to conceal it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you glad to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, love dancing madly in his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t ask that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Griffiths sends you his love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cheek!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had talked to her a great deal of Griffiths. He had told her how\r\nflirtatious he was and had amused her often with the narration of some\r\nadventure which Griffiths under the seal of secrecy had imparted to\r\nhim. Mildred had listened, with some pretence of disgust sometimes, but\r\ngenerally with curiosity; and Philip, admiringly, had enlarged upon his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s good looks and charm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll like him just as much as I do. He\xe2\x80\x99s so jolly and\r\namusing, and he\xe2\x80\x99s such an awfully good sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip told her how, when they were perfect strangers, Griffiths had\r\nnursed him through an illness; and in the telling Griffiths\xe2\x80\x99\r\nself-sacrifice lost nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t help liking him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like good-looking men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re too conceited\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to know you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to him about you an awful lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you said?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mildred.\r\n\r\nPhilip had no one but Griffiths to talk to of his love for Mildred, and\r\nlittle by little had told him the whole story of his connection with\r\nher. He described her to him fifty times. He dwelt amorously on every\r\ndetail of her appearance, and Griffiths knew exactly how her thin hands\r\nwere shaped and how white her face was, and he laughed at Philip when\r\nhe talked of the charm of her pale, thin lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I don\xe2\x80\x99t take things so badly as that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worth living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled. Griffiths did not know the delight of being so madly in\r\nlove that it was like meat and wine and the air one breathed and\r\nwhatever else was essential to existence. Griffiths knew that Philip\r\nhad looked after the girl while she was having her baby and was now\r\ngoing away with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must say you\xe2\x80\x99ve deserved to get something,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmust have cost you a pretty penny. It\xe2\x80\x99s lucky you can afford it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what do I care!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince it was early for luncheon, Philip and Mildred sat in one of the\r\nshelters on the parade, sunning themselves, and watched the people\r\npass. There were the Brighton shop-boys who walked in twos and threes,\r\nswinging their canes, and there were the Brighton shop-girls who\r\ntripped along in giggling bunches. They could tell the people who had\r\ncome down from London for the day; the keen air gave a fillip to their\r\nweariness. There were many Jews, stout ladies in tight satin dresses\r\nand diamonds, little corpulent men with a gesticulative manner. There\r\nwere middle-aged gentlemen spending a week-end in one of the large\r\nhotels, carefully dressed; and they walked industriously after too\r\nsubstantial a breakfast to give themselves an appetite for too\r\nsubstantial a luncheon: they exchanged the time of day with friends and\r\ntalked of Dr. Brighton or London-by-the-Sea. Here and there a\r\nwell-known actor passed, elaborately unconscious of the attention he\r\nexcited: sometimes he wore patent leather boots, a coat with an\r\nastrakhan collar, and carried a silver-knobbed stick; and sometimes,\r\nlooking as though he had come from a day\xe2\x80\x99s shooting, he strolled in\r\nknickerbockers, and ulster of Harris tweed, and a tweed hat on the back\r\nof his head. The sun shone on the blue sea, and the blue sea was trim\r\nand neat.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon they went to Hove to see the woman who was to take\r\ncharge of the baby. She lived in a small house in a back street, but it\r\nwas clean and tidy. Her name was Mrs. Harding. She was an elderly,\r\nstout person, with gray hair and a red, fleshy face. She looked\r\nmotherly in her cap, and Philip thought she seemed kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you find it an awful nuisance to look after a baby?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe explained that her husband was a curate, a good deal older than\r\nherself, who had difficulty in getting permanent work since vicars\r\nwanted young men to assist them; he earned a little now and then by\r\ndoing locums when someone took a holiday or fell ill, and a charitable\r\ninstitution gave them a small pension; but her life was lonely, it\r\nwould be something to do to look after a child, and the few shillings a\r\nweek paid for it would help her to keep things going. She promised that\r\nit should be well fed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the lady, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred, when they went away.\r\n\r\nThey went back to have tea at the Metropole. Mildred liked the crowd\r\nand the band. Philip was tired of talking, and he watched her face as\r\nshe looked with keen eyes at the dresses of the women who came in. She\r\nhad a peculiar sharpness for reckoning up what things cost, and now and\r\nthen she leaned over to him and whispered the result of her\r\nmeditations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you see that aigrette there? That cost every bit of seven guineas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOr: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at that ermine, Philip. That\xe2\x80\x99s rabbit, that is\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nermine.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d know it a mile off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled happily. He was glad to see her pleasure, and the\r\ningenuousness of her conversation amused and touched him. The band\r\nplayed sentimental music.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they walked down to the station, and Philip took her arm.\r\nHe told her what arrangements he had made for their journey to France.\r\nShe was to come up to London at the end of the week, but she told him\r\nthat she could not go away till the Saturday of the week after that. He\r\nhad already engaged a room in a hotel in Paris. He was looking forward\r\neagerly to taking the tickets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t mind going second-class, will you? We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nextravagant, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be all the better if we can do ourselves pretty\r\nwell when we get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had talked to her a hundred times of the Quarter. They would wander\r\nthrough its pleasant old streets, and they would sit idly in the\r\ncharming gardens of the Luxembourg. If the weather was fine perhaps,\r\nwhen they had had enough of Paris, they might go to Fontainebleau. The\r\ntrees would be just bursting into leaf. The green of the forest in\r\nspring was more beautiful than anything he knew; it was like a song,\r\nand it was like the happy pain of love. Mildred listened quietly. He\r\nturned to her and tried to look deep into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do want to come, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I shall\r\nget through the next days. I\xe2\x80\x99m so afraid something will happen to\r\nprevent it. It maddens me sometimes that I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how much I\r\nlove you. And at last, at last\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off. They reached the station, but they had dawdled on the\r\nway, and Philip had barely time to say good-night. He kissed her\r\nquickly and ran towards the wicket as fast as he could. She stood where\r\nhe left her. He was strangely grotesque when he ran.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Saturday Mildred returned, and that evening Philip kept\r\nher to himself. He took seats for the play, and they drank champagne at\r\ndinner. It was her first gaiety in London for so long that she enjoyed\r\neverything ingenuously. She cuddled up to Philip when they drove from\r\nthe theatre to the room he had taken for her in Pimlico.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really believe you\xe2\x80\x99re quite glad to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but gently pressed his hand. Demonstrations of\r\naffection were so rare with her that Philip was enchanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked Griffiths to dine with us tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve done that. I wanted to meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no place of entertainment to take her to on Sunday night, and\r\nPhilip was afraid she would be bored if she were alone with him all\r\nday. Griffiths was amusing; he would help them to get through the\r\nevening; and Philip was so fond of them both that he wanted them to\r\nknow and to like one another. He left Mildred with the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly six days more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had arranged to dine in the gallery at Romano\xe2\x80\x99s on Sunday, because\r\nthe dinner was excellent and looked as though it cost a good deal more\r\nthan it did. Philip and Mildred arrived first and had to wait some time\r\nfor Griffiths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an unpunctual devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s probably making love to\r\none of his numerous flames.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut presently he appeared. He was a handsome creature, tall and thin;\r\nhis head was placed well on the body, it gave him a conquering air\r\nwhich was attractive; and his curly hair, his bold, friendly blue eyes,\r\nhis red mouth, were charming. Philip saw Mildred look at him with\r\nappreciation, and he felt a curious satisfaction. Griffiths greeted\r\nthem with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a great deal about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mildred, as he took her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much as I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about you,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he been blackening my character?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriffiths laughed, and Philip saw that Mildred noticed how white and\r\nregular his teeth were and how pleasant his smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to feel like old friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve talked so much\r\nabout you to one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGriffiths was in the best possible humour, for, having at length passed\r\nhis final examination, he was qualified, and he had just been appointed\r\nhouse-surgeon at a hospital in the North of London. He was taking up\r\nhis duties at the beginning of May and meanwhile was going home for a\r\nholiday; this was his last week in town, and he was determined to get\r\nas much enjoyment into it as he could. He began to talk the gay\r\nnonsense which Philip admired because he could not copy it. There was\r\nnothing much in what he said, but his vivacity gave it point. There\r\nflowed from him a force of life which affected everyone who knew him;\r\nit was almost as sensible as bodily warmth. Mildred was more lively\r\nthan Philip had ever known her, and he was delighted to see that his\r\nlittle party was a success. She was amusing herself enormously. She\r\nlaughed louder and louder. She quite forgot the genteel reserve which\r\nhad become second nature to her.\r\n\r\nPresently Griffiths said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, it\xe2\x80\x99s dreadfully difficult for me to call you Mrs. Miller.\r\nPhilip never calls you anything but Mildred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay she won\xe2\x80\x99t scratch your eyes out if you call her that too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlaughed Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she must call me Harry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip sat silent while they chattered away and thought how good it was\r\nto see people happy. Now and then Griffiths teased him a little,\r\nkindly, because he was always so serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe he\xe2\x80\x99s quite fond of you, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Mildred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad old thing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Griffiths, and taking Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand he shook it gaily.\r\n\r\nIt seemed an added charm in Griffiths that he liked Philip. They were\r\nall sober people, and the wine they had drunk went to their heads.\r\nGriffiths became more talkative and so boisterous that Philip, amused,\r\nhad to beg him to be quiet. He had a gift for story-telling, and his\r\nadventures lost nothing of their romance and their laughter in his\r\nnarration. He played in all of them a gallant, humorous part. Mildred,\r\nher eyes shining with excitement, urged him on. He poured out anecdote\r\nafter anecdote. When the lights began to be turned out she was\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word, the evening has gone quickly. I thought it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t more than\r\nhalf past nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey got up to go and when she said good-bye, she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming to have tea at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s room tomorrow. You might look in if\r\nyou can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to Pimlico Mildred talked of nothing but Griffiths. She\r\nwas taken with his good looks, his well-cut clothes, his voice, his\r\ngaiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you like him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember you were rather\r\nsniffy about meeting him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice of him to be so fond of you, Philip. He is a nice\r\nfriend for you to have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put up her face to Philip for him to kiss her. It was a thing she\r\ndid rarely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have enjoyed myself this evening, Philip. Thank you so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so absurd,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, touched by her appreciation so that\r\nhe felt the moisture come to his eyes.\r\n\r\nShe opened her door and just before she went in, turned again to\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Harry I\xe2\x80\x99m madly in love with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext day, when they were having tea, Griffiths came in. He sank lazily\r\ninto an arm-chair. There was something strangely sensual in the slow\r\nmovements of his large limbs. Philip remained silent, while the others\r\nchattered away, but he was enjoying himself. He admired them both so\r\nmuch that it seemed natural enough for them to admire one another. He\r\ndid not care if Griffiths absorbed Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s attention, he would have\r\nher to himself during the evening: he had something of the attitude of\r\na loving husband, confident in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s affection, who looks on with\r\namusement while she flirts harmlessly with a stranger. But at half past\r\nseven he looked at his watch and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about time we went out to dinner, Mildred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, and Griffiths seemed to be considering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting along,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was\r\nso late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you doing anything tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mildred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another silence. Philip felt slightly irritated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just go and have a wash,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and to Mildred he added:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to wash your hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you come and dine with us?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Griffiths.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Philip and saw him staring at him sombrely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dined with you last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be in the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Mildred. \xe2\x80\x9cMake him come, Philip. He\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be in the way, will he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him come by all means if he\xe2\x80\x99d like to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just go upstairs and\r\ntidy myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moment he left the room Philip turned to Mildred angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth did you ask him to dine with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help myself. It would have looked so funny to say nothing\r\nwhen he said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what rot! And why the hell did you ask him if he was doing\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s pale lips tightened a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a little amusement sometimes. I get tired always being alone\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey heard Griffiths coming heavily down the stairs, and Philip went\r\ninto his bed-room to wash. They dined in the neighbourhood in an\r\nItalian restaurant. Philip was cross and silent, but he quickly\r\nrealised that he was showing to disadvantage in comparison with\r\nGriffiths, and he forced himself to hide his annoyance. He drank a good\r\ndeal of wine to destroy the pain that was gnawing at his heart, and he\r\nset himself to talk. Mildred, as though remorseful for what she had\r\nsaid, did all she could to make herself pleasant to him. She was kindly\r\nand affectionate. Presently Philip began to think he had been a fool to\r\nsurrender to a feeling of jealousy. After dinner when they got into a\r\nhansom to drive to a music-hall Mildred, sitting between the two men,\r\nof her own accord gave him her hand. His anger vanished. Suddenly, he\r\nknew not how, he grew conscious that Griffiths was holding her other\r\nhand. The pain seized him again violently, it was a real physical pain,\r\nand he asked himself, panic-stricken, what he might have asked himself\r\nbefore, whether Mildred and Griffiths were in love with one another. He\r\ncould not see anything of the performance on account of the mist of\r\nsuspicion, anger, dismay, and wretchedness which seemed to be before\r\nhis eyes; but he forced himself to conceal the fact that anything was\r\nthe matter; he went on talking and laughing. Then a strange desire to\r\ntorture himself seized him, and he got up, saying he wanted to go and\r\ndrink something. Mildred and Griffiths had never been alone together\r\nfor a moment. He wanted to leave them by themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got rather a thirst on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nonsense, you stay and talk to Mildred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not know why he said that. He was throwing them together now\r\nto make the pain he suffered more intolerable. He did not go to the\r\nbar, but up into the balcony, from where he could watch them and not be\r\nseen. They had ceased to look at the stage and were smiling into one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Griffiths was talking with his usual happy fluency and\r\nMildred seemed to hang on his lips. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s head began to ache\r\nfrightfully. He stood there motionless. He knew he would be in the way\r\nif he went back. They were enjoying themselves without him, and he was\r\nsuffering, suffering. Time passed, and now he had an extraordinary\r\nshyness about rejoining them. He knew they had not thought of him at\r\nall, and he reflected bitterly that he had paid for the dinner and\r\ntheir seats in the music-hall. What a fool they were making of him! He\r\nwas hot with shame. He could see how happy they were without him. His\r\ninstinct was to leave them to themselves and go home, but he had not\r\nhis hat and coat, and it would necessitate endless explanations. He\r\nwent back. He felt a shadow of annoyance in Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when she saw\r\nhim, and his heart sank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a devil of a time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths, with a smile of\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met some men I knew. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to them, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\naway. I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be all right together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been enjoying myself thoroughly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nabout Mildred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh of happy complacency. There was a vulgar sound\r\nin the ring of it that horrified Philip. He suggested that they should\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Griffiths, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll both drive you home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip suspected that she had suggested that arrangement so that she\r\nmight not be left alone with him. In the cab he did not take her hand\r\nnor did she offer it, and he knew all the time that she was holding\r\nGriffiths\xe2\x80\x99. His chief thought was that it was all so horribly vulgar.\r\nAs they drove along he asked himself what plans they had made to meet\r\nwithout his knowledge, he cursed himself for having left them alone, he\r\nhad actually gone out of his way to enable them to arrange things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s keep the cab,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, when they reached the house in which\r\nMildred was lodging. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m too tired to walk home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the way back Griffiths talked gaily and seemed indifferent to the\r\nfact that Philip answered in monosyllables. Philip felt he must notice\r\nthat something was the matter. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s silence at last grew too\r\nsignificant to struggle against, and Griffiths, suddenly nervous,\r\nceased talking. Philip wanted to say something, but he was so shy he\r\ncould hardly bring himself to, and yet the time was passing and the\r\nopportunity would be lost. It was best to get at the truth at once. He\r\nforced himself to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in love with Mildred?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d Griffiths laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been so funny about this\r\nevening? Of course not, my dear old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to slip his hand through Philip\xe2\x80\x99s arm, but Philip drew himself\r\naway. He knew Griffiths was lying. He could not bring himself to force\r\nGriffiths to tell him that he had not been holding the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand. He\r\nsuddenly felt very weak and broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to you, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got so many\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t take her away from me. It means my whole life. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so\r\nawfully wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice broke, and he could not prevent the sob that was torn from\r\nhim. He was horribly ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear old boy, you know I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to hurt you. I\xe2\x80\x99m far\r\ntoo fond of you for that. I was only playing the fool. If I\xe2\x80\x99d known you\r\nwere going to take it like that I\xe2\x80\x99d have been more careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that true?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a twopenny damn for her. I give you my word of honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip gave a sigh of relief. The cab stopped at their door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day Philip was in a good temper. He was very anxious not to bore\r\nMildred with too much of his society, and so had arranged that he\r\nshould not see her till dinner-time. She was ready when he fetched her,\r\nand he chaffed her for her unwonted punctuality. She was wearing a new\r\ndress he had given her. He remarked on its smartness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go back and be altered,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe skirt hangs all\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make the dressmaker hurry up if you want to take it to\r\nParis with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready in time for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly three more whole days. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go over by the eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, shall\r\nwe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would have her for nearly a month entirely to himself. His eyes\r\nrested on her with hungry adoration. He was able to laugh a little at\r\nhis own passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what it is I see in you,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a nice thing to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nHer body was so thin that one could almost see her skeleton. Her chest\r\nwas as flat as a boy\xe2\x80\x99s. Her mouth, with its narrow pale lips, was ugly,\r\nand her skin was faintly green.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall give you Blaud\xe2\x80\x99s Pills in quantities when we\xe2\x80\x99re away,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to bring you back fat and rosy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get fat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe did not speak of Griffiths, and presently while they were dining\r\nPhilip half in malice, for he felt sure of himself and his power over\r\nher, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me you were having a great flirtation with Harry last\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you I was in love with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to know that he\xe2\x80\x99s not in love with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment, looking at Philip, and a curious gleam came\r\ninto her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to read a letter I had from him this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe handed him an envelope and Philip recognised Griffiths\xe2\x80\x99 bold,\r\nlegible writing. There were eight pages. It was well written, frank and\r\ncharming; it was the letter of a man who was used to making love to\r\nwomen. He told Mildred that he loved her passionately, he had fallen in\r\nlove with her the first moment he saw her; he did not want to love her,\r\nfor he knew how fond Philip was of her, but he could not help himself.\r\nPhilip was such a dear, and he was very much ashamed of himself, but it\r\nwas not his fault, he was just carried away. He paid her delightful\r\ncompliments. Finally he thanked her for consenting to lunch with him\r\nnext day and said he was dreadfully impatient to see her. Philip\r\nnoticed that the letter was dated the night before; Griffiths must have\r\nwritten it after leaving Philip, and had taken the trouble to go out\r\nand post it when Philip thought he was in bed.\r\n\r\nHe read it with a sickening palpitation of his heart, but gave no\r\noutward sign of surprise. He handed it back to Mildred with a smile,\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you enjoy your lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said emphatically.\r\n\r\nHe felt that his hands were trembling, so he put them under the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take Griffiths too seriously. He\xe2\x80\x99s just a butterfly, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the letter and looked at it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it either,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a voice which she tried to make\r\nnonchalant. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s come over me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little awkward for me, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a quick look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re taking it pretty calmly, I must say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you expect me to do? Do you want me to tear out my hair in\r\nhandfuls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d be angry with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe funny thing is, I\xe2\x80\x99m not at all. I ought to have known this would\r\nhappen. I was a fool to bring you together. I know perfectly well that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s got every advantage over me; he\xe2\x80\x99s much jollier, and he\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nhandsome, he\xe2\x80\x99s more amusing, he can talk to you about the things that\r\ninterest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by that. If I\xe2\x80\x99m not clever I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not the fool you think I am, not by a long way, I can tell you.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a bit too superior for me, my young friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you want to quarrel with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should treat me as if I was I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to offend you. I just wanted to talk things\r\nover quietly. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make a mess of them if we can help it. I\r\nsaw you were attracted by him and it seemed to me very natural. The\r\nonly thing that really hurts me is that he should have encouraged you.\r\nHe knew how awfully keen I was on you. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s rather shabby of\r\nhim to have written that letter to you five minutes after he told me he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care twopence about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make me like him any the less by saying\r\nnasty things about him, you\xe2\x80\x99re mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent for a moment. He did not know what words he could use\r\nto make her see his point of view. He wanted to speak coolly and\r\ndeliberately, but he was in such a turmoil of emotion that he could not\r\nclear his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not worth while sacrificing everything for an infatuation that\r\nyou know can\xe2\x80\x99t last. After all, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for anyone more than\r\nten days, and you\xe2\x80\x99re rather cold; that sort of thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean very\r\nmuch to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made it more difficult for him by adopting a cantankerous tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re in love with him you can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just bear it as\r\nbest I can. We get on very well together, you and I, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve not\r\nbehaved badly to you, have I? I\xe2\x80\x99ve always known that you\xe2\x80\x99re not in love\r\nwith me, but you like me all right, and when we get over to Paris\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll forget about Griffiths. If you make up your mind to put him out\r\nof your thoughts you won\xe2\x80\x99t find it so hard as all that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndeserved that you should do something for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, and they went on eating their dinner. When the\r\nsilence grew oppressive Philip began to talk of indifferent things. He\r\npretended not to notice that Mildred was inattentive. Her answers were\r\nperfunctory, and she volunteered no remarks of her own. At last she\r\ninterrupted abruptly what he was saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able to go away on Saturday. The doctor\r\nsays I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew this was not true, but he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will you be able to come away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him, saw that his face was white and rigid, and looked\r\nnervously away. She was at that moment a little afraid of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may as well tell you and have done with it, I can\xe2\x80\x99t come away with\r\nyou at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were driving at that. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late to change your mind\r\nnow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the tickets and everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish me to go unless I wanted it too, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my mind. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have any more tricks played\r\nwith me. You must come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you very much, Philip, as a friend. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think\r\nof anything else. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you that way. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were quite willing to a week ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was different then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t met Griffiths?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said yourself I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it if I\xe2\x80\x99m in love with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face was set into a sulky look, and she kept her eyes fixed on her\r\nplate. Philip was white with rage. He would have liked to hit her in\r\nthe face with his clenched fist, and in fancy he saw how she would look\r\nwith a black eye. There were two lads of eighteen dining at a table\r\nnear them, and now and then they looked at Mildred; he wondered if they\r\nenvied him dining with a pretty girl; perhaps they were wishing they\r\nstood in his shoes. It was Mildred who broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of our going away together? I\xe2\x80\x99d be thinking of him all\r\nthe time. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much fun for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my business,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nShe thought over all his reply implicated, and she reddened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s just beastly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were a gentleman in every sense of the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis reply entertained him, and he laughed as he said it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t come away with you,\r\nPhilip. I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry. I know I haven\xe2\x80\x99t behaved well to you, but\r\none can\xe2\x80\x99t force themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you forgotten that when you were in trouble I did everything for\r\nyou? I planked out the money to keep you till your baby was born, I\r\npaid for your doctor and everything, I paid for you to go to Brighton,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m paying for the keep of your baby, I\xe2\x80\x99m paying for your clothes,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m paying for every stitch you\xe2\x80\x99ve got on now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you was a gentleman you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me in\r\nmy face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, shut up. What d\xe2\x80\x99you suppose I care if I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ngentleman or not? If I were a gentleman I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waste my time with\r\na vulgar slut like you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn if you like me or not. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsick of being made a blasted fool of. You\xe2\x80\x99re jolly well coming to Paris\r\nwith me on Saturday or you can take the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer cheeks were red with anger, and when she answered her voice had the\r\nhard commonness which she concealed generally by a genteel enunciation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never liked you, not from the beginning, but you forced yourself on\r\nme, I always hated it when you kissed me. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let you touch me\r\nnow not if I was starving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip tried to swallow the food on his plate, but the muscles of his\r\nthroat refused to act. He gulped down something to drink and lit a\r\ncigarette. He was trembling in every part. He did not speak. He waited\r\nfor her to move, but she sat in silence, staring at the white\r\ntablecloth. If they had been alone he would have flung his arms round\r\nher and kissed her passionately; he fancied the throwing back of her\r\nlong white throat as he pressed upon her mouth with his lips. They\r\npassed an hour without speaking, and at last Philip thought the waiter\r\nbegan to stare at them curiously. He called for the bill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d he said then, in an even tone.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, but gathered together her bag and her gloves. She\r\nput on her coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you seeing Griffiths again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered indifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better talk it over with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened her bag mechanically and saw a piece of paper in it. She\r\ntook it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the bill for this dress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised I\xe2\x80\x99d give her the money tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that mean you won\xe2\x80\x99t pay for it after having told me I could get\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, flushing quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to help you. He owes me seven pounds at the moment, and\r\nhe pawned his microscope last week, because he was so broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t think you can frighten me by that. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite capable of\r\nearning my own living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing you can do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t propose to give you a farthing\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought of her rent due on Saturday and the baby\xe2\x80\x99s keep, but did\r\nnot say anything. They left the restaurant, and in the street Philip\r\nasked her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I call a cab for you? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a little stroll.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any money. I had to pay a bill this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you to walk. If you want to see me tomorrow I shall be\r\nin about tea-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat and sauntered away. He looked round in a moment and\r\nsaw that she was standing helplessly where he had left her, looking at\r\nthe traffic. He went back and with a laugh pressed a coin into her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s two bob for you to get home with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore she could speak he hurried away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, in the afternoon, Philip sat in his room and wondered whether\r\nMildred would come. He had slept badly. He had spent the morning in the\r\nclub of the Medical School, reading one newspaper after another. It was\r\nthe vacation and few students he knew were in London, but he found one\r\nor two people to talk to, he played a game of chess, and so wore out\r\nthe tedious hours. After luncheon he felt so tired, his head was aching\r\nso, that he went back to his lodgings and lay down; he tried to read a\r\nnovel. He had not seen Griffiths. He was not in when Philip returned\r\nthe night before; he heard him come back, but he did not as usual look\r\ninto Philip\xe2\x80\x99s room to see if he was asleep; and in the morning Philip\r\nheard him go out early. It was clear that he wanted to avoid him.\r\nSuddenly there was a light tap at his door. Philip sprang to his feet\r\nand opened it. Mildred stood on the threshold. She did not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe closed the door after her. She sat down. She hesitated to begin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for giving me that two shillings last night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a faint smile. It reminded Philip of the timid,\r\ningratiating look of a puppy that has been beaten for naughtiness and\r\nwants to reconcile himself with his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been lunching with Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you still want me to go away with you on Saturday, Philip, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA quick thrill of triumph shot through his heart, but it was a\r\nsensation that only lasted an instant; it was followed by a suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the money?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered simply. \xe2\x80\x9cHarry can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. He owes five\r\nweeks here, and he owes you seven pounds, and his tailor\xe2\x80\x99s pressing him\r\nfor money. He\xe2\x80\x99d pawn anything he could, but he\xe2\x80\x99s pawned everything\r\nalready. I had a job to put the woman off about my new dress, and on\r\nSaturday there\xe2\x80\x99s the book at my lodgings, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get work in five\r\nminutes. It always means waiting some little time till there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nvacancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said all this in an even, querulous tone, as though she were\r\nrecounting the injustices of fate, which had to be borne as part of the\r\nnatural order of things. Philip did not answer. He knew what she told\r\nhim well enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said partly,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Harry says you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a brick to both of us. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been a real\r\ngood friend to him, he says, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me what p\xe2\x80\x99raps no\r\nother man would have done. We must do the straight thing, he says. And\r\nhe said what you said about him, that he\xe2\x80\x99s fickle by nature, he\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nlike you, and I should be a fool to throw you away for him. He won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlast and you will, he says so himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you WANT to come away with me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, and the corners of his mouth turned down in an\r\nexpression of misery. He had triumphed indeed, and he was going to have\r\nhis way. He gave a little laugh of derision at his own humiliation. She\r\nlooked at him quickly, but did not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve looked forward with all my soul to going away with you, and I\r\nthought at last, after all that wretchedness, I was going to be happy\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not finish what he was going to say. And then on a sudden,\r\nwithout warning, Mildred broke into a storm of tears. She was sitting\r\nin the chair in which Norah had sat and wept, and like her she hid her\r\nface on the back of it, towards the side where there was a little bump\r\nformed by the sagging in the middle, where the head had rested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not lucky with women,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Philip.\r\n\r\nHer thin body was shaken with sobs. Philip had never seen a woman cry\r\nwith such an utter abandonment. It was horribly painful, and his heart\r\nwas torn. Without realising what he did, he went up to her and put his\r\narms round her; she did not resist, but in her wretchedness surrendered\r\nherself to his comforting. He whispered to her little words of solace.\r\nHe scarcely knew what he was saying, he bent over her and kissed her\r\nrepeatedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you awfully unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was dead,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\xe2\x80\x99d died when the baby come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hat was in her way, and Philip took it off for her. He placed her\r\nhead more comfortably in the chair, and then he went and sat down at\r\nthe table and looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is awful, love, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy anyone wanting to be in\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently the violence of her sobbing diminished and she sat in the\r\nchair, exhausted, with her head thrown back and her arms hanging by her\r\nside. She had the grotesque look of one of those painters\xe2\x80\x99 dummies used\r\nto hang draperies on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you loved him so much as all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe understood Griffiths\xe2\x80\x99 love well enough, for he put himself in\r\nGriffiths\xe2\x80\x99 place and saw with his eyes, touched with his hands; he was\r\nable to think himself in Griffiths\xe2\x80\x99 body, and he kissed her with his\r\nlips, smiled at her with his smiling blue eyes. It was her emotion that\r\nsurprised him. He had never thought her capable of passion, and this\r\nwas passion: there was no mistaking it. Something seemed to give way in\r\nhis heart; it really felt to him as though something were breaking, and\r\nhe felt strangely weak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make you unhappy. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t come away with me if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the money all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I said I\xe2\x80\x99d come, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good, if you\xe2\x80\x99re sick with love for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the word. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick with love. I know it won\xe2\x80\x99t last, just\r\nas well as he does, but just now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused and shut her eyes as though she were going to faint. A\r\nstrange idea came to Philip, and he spoke it as it came, without\r\nstopping to think it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go away with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I? You know we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat up and looked at him. Her eyes began to shine, and the colour\r\ncame into her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the best thing would be to get it over, and then you\xe2\x80\x99d come\r\nback to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow that he had made the suggestion he was sick with anguish, and yet\r\nthe torture of it gave him a strange, subtle sensation. She stared at\r\nhim with open eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how could we, on your money? Harry wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, he would, if you persuaded him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer objections made him insist, and yet he wanted her with all his\r\nheart to refuse vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a fiver, and you can go away from Saturday to Monday.\r\nYou could easily do that. On Monday he\xe2\x80\x99s going home till he takes up\r\nhis appointment at the North London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Philip, do you mean that?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, clasping her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\ncould only let us go\xe2\x80\x94I would love you so much afterwards, I\xe2\x80\x99d do\r\nanything for you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I shall get over it if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only do that.\r\nWould you really give us the money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe was entirely changed now. She began to laugh. He could see that she\r\nwas insanely happy. She got up and knelt down by Philip\xe2\x80\x99s side, taking\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a brick, Philip. You\xe2\x80\x99re the best fellow I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known. Won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou be angry with me afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, smiling, but with what agony in his heart!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I go and tell Harry now? And can I say to him that you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind?\r\nHe won\xe2\x80\x99t consent unless you promise it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how I love him! And afterwards I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything you like. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome over to Paris with you or anywhere on Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up and put on her hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask him if he\xe2\x80\x99ll take me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you want me to stay? I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down, but he gave a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, you\xe2\x80\x99d better go at once. There\xe2\x80\x99s only one\r\nthing: I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see Griffiths just now, it would hurt me too\r\nawfully. Say I have no ill-feeling towards him or anything like that,\r\nbut ask him to keep out of my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d She sprang up and put on her gloves. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know\r\nwhat he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better dine with me tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put up her face for him to kiss her, and when he pressed his lips\r\nto hers she threw her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a darling, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sent him a note a couple of hours later to say that she had a\r\nheadache and could not dine with him. Philip had almost expected it. He\r\nknew that she was dining with Griffiths. He was horribly jealous, but\r\nthe sudden passion which had seized the pair of them seemed like\r\nsomething that had come from the outside, as though a god had visited\r\nthem with it, and he felt himself helpless. It seemed so natural that\r\nthey should love one another. He saw all the advantages that Griffiths\r\nhad over himself and confessed that in Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s place he would have\r\ndone as Mildred did. What hurt him most was Griffiths\xe2\x80\x99 treachery; they\r\nhad been such good friends, and Griffiths knew how passionately devoted\r\nhe was to Mildred: he might have spared him.\r\n\r\nHe did not see Mildred again till Friday; he was sick for a sight of\r\nher by then; but when she came and he realised that he had gone out of\r\nher thoughts entirely, for they were engrossed in Griffiths, he\r\nsuddenly hated her. He saw now why she and Griffiths loved one another,\r\nGriffiths was stupid, oh so stupid! he had known that all along, but\r\nhad shut his eyes to it, stupid and empty-headed: that charm of his\r\nconcealed an utter selfishness; he was willing to sacrifice anyone to\r\nhis appetites. And how inane was the life he led, lounging about bars\r\nand drinking in music halls, wandering from one light amour to another!\r\nHe never read a book, he was blind to everything that was not frivolous\r\nand vulgar; he had never a thought that was fine: the word most common\r\non his lips was smart; that was his highest praise for man or woman.\r\nSmart! It was no wonder he pleased Mildred. They suited one another.\r\n\r\nPhilip talked to Mildred of things that mattered to neither of them. He\r\nknew she wanted to speak of Griffiths, but he gave her no opportunity.\r\nHe did not refer to the fact that two evenings before she had put off\r\ndining with him on a trivial excuse. He was casual with her, trying to\r\nmake her think he was suddenly grown indifferent; and he exercised\r\npeculiar skill in saying little things which he knew would wound her;\r\nbut which were so indefinite, so delicately cruel, that she could not\r\ntake exception to them. At last she got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I must be going off now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand, he took it, said good-bye, and opened the door\r\nfor her. He knew what she wanted to speak about, and he knew also that\r\nhis cold, ironical air intimidated her. Often his shyness made him seem\r\nso frigid that unintentionally he frightened people, and, having\r\ndiscovered this, he was able when occasion arose to assume the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten what you promised?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, as he held\r\nopen the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much d\xe2\x80\x99you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with an icy deliberation which made his words peculiarly\r\noffensive. Mildred flushed. He knew she hated him at that moment, and\r\nhe wondered at the self-control by which she prevented herself from\r\nflying out at him. He wanted to make her suffer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the dress and the book tomorrow. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Harry won\xe2\x80\x99t come,\r\nso we shan\xe2\x80\x99t want money for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart gave a great thud against his ribs, and he let the door\r\nhandle go. The door swung to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, not on your money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA devil seized Philip, a devil of self-torture which was always lurking\r\nwithin him, and, though with all his soul he wished that Griffiths and\r\nMildred should not go away together, he could not help himself; he set\r\nhimself to persuade Griffiths through her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not, if I\xe2\x80\x99m willing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I told him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought if he really wanted to go he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that, he wants to all right. He\xe2\x80\x99d go at once if he had\r\nthe money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s squeamish about it I\xe2\x80\x99ll give YOU the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said you\xe2\x80\x99d lend it if he liked, and we\xe2\x80\x99d pay it back as soon as we\r\ncould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather a change for you going on your knees to get a man to take\r\nyou away for a week-end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is rather, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a shameless little laugh. It\r\nsent a cold shudder down Philip\xe2\x80\x99s spine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do then?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. He\xe2\x80\x99s going home tomorrow. He must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat would be Philip\xe2\x80\x99s salvation. With Griffiths out of the way he\r\ncould get Mildred back. She knew no one in London, she would be thrown\r\non to his society, and when they were alone together he could soon make\r\nher forget this infatuation. If he said nothing more he was safe. But\r\nhe had a fiendish desire to break down their scruples, he wanted to\r\nknow how abominably they could behave towards him; if he tempted them a\r\nlittle more they would yield, and he took a fierce joy at the thought\r\nof their dishonour. Though every word he spoke tortured him, he found\r\nin the torture a horrible delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks as if it were now or never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I told him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThere was a passionate note in her voice which struck Philip. He was\r\nbiting his nails in his nervousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were you thinking of going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, to Oxford. He was at the \xe2\x80\x99Varsity there, you know. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nshow me the colleges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip remembered that once he had suggested going to Oxford for the\r\nday, and she had expressed firmly the boredom she felt at the thought\r\nof sights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it looks as if you\xe2\x80\x99d have fine weather. It ought to be very jolly\r\nthere just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done all I could to persuade him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you have another try?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I say you want us to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you must go as far as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nShe paused for a minute or two, looking at him. Philip forced himself\r\nto look at her in a friendly way. He hated her, he despised her, he\r\nloved her with all his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see if he can\xe2\x80\x99t arrange it.\r\nAnd then, if he says yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and fetch the money tomorrow. When\r\nshall you be in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come back here after luncheon and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the money for your dress and your room now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to his desk and took out what money he had. The dress was six\r\nguineas; there was besides her rent and her food, and the baby\xe2\x80\x99s keep\r\nfor a week. He gave her eight pounds ten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks very much,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe left him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter lunching in the basement of the Medical School Philip went back\r\nto his rooms. It was Saturday afternoon, and the landlady was cleaning\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Griffiths in?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. He went away this morning, soon after you went out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, sir. He\xe2\x80\x99s taken his luggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip wondered what this could mean. He took a book and began to read.\r\nIt was Burton\xe2\x80\x99s Journey to Meccah, which he had just got out of the\r\nWestminster Public Library; and he read the first page, but could make\r\nno sense of it, for his mind was elsewhere; he was listening all the\r\ntime for a ring at the bell. He dared not hope that Griffiths had gone\r\naway already, without Mildred, to his home in Cumberland. Mildred would\r\nbe coming presently for the money. He set his teeth and read on; he\r\ntried desperately to concentrate his attention; the sentences etched\r\nthemselves in his brain by the force of his effort, but they were\r\ndistorted by the agony he was enduring. He wished with all his heart\r\nthat he had not made the horrible proposition to give them money; but\r\nnow that he had made it he lacked the strength to go back on it, not on\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s account, but on his own. There was a morbid obstinacy in him\r\nwhich forced him to do the thing he had determined. He discovered that\r\nthe three pages he had read had made no impression on him at all; and\r\nhe went back and started from the beginning: he found himself reading\r\none sentence over and over again; and now it weaved itself in with his\r\nthoughts, horribly, like some formula in a nightmare. One thing he\r\ncould do was to go out and keep away till midnight; they could not go\r\nthen; and he saw them calling at the house every hour to ask if he was\r\nin. He enjoyed the thought of their disappointment. He repeated that\r\nsentence to himself mechanically. But he could not do that. Let them\r\ncome and take the money, and he would know then to what depths of\r\ninfamy it was possible for men to descend. He could not read any more\r\nnow. He simply could not see the words. He leaned back in his chair,\r\nclosing his eyes, and, numb with misery, waited for Mildred.\r\n\r\nThe landlady came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you see Mrs. Miller, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow her in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip pulled himself together to receive her without any sign of what\r\nhe was feeling. He had an impulse to throw himself on his knees and\r\nseize her hands and beg her not to go; but he knew there was no way of\r\nmoving her; she would tell Griffiths what he had said and how he acted.\r\nHe was ashamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how about the little jaunt?\xe2\x80\x9d he said gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going. Harry\xe2\x80\x99s outside. I told him you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see him,\r\nso he\xe2\x80\x99s kept out of your way. But he wants to know if he can come in\r\njust for a minute to say good-bye to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe could see she did not care if he saw Griffiths or not. Now that she\r\nwas there he wanted her to go quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, here\xe2\x80\x99s the fiver. I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it and thanked him. She turned to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, on Monday. Harry must go home then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew what he was going to say was humiliating, but he was broken\r\ndown with jealousy and desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall see you, shan\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not help the note of appeal in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know the moment I\xe2\x80\x99m back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with her. Through the curtains he watched her jump into\r\na four-wheeler that stood at the door. It rolled away. Then he threw\r\nhimself on his bed and hid his face in his hands. He felt tears coming\r\nto his eyes, and he was angry with himself; he clenched his hands and\r\nscrewed up his body to prevent them; but he could not; and great\r\npainful sobs were forced from him.\r\n\r\nHe got up at last, exhausted and ashamed, and washed his face. He mixed\r\nhimself a strong whiskey and soda. It made him feel a little better.\r\nThen he caught sight of the tickets to Paris, which were on the\r\nchimney-piece, and, seizing them, with an impulse of rage he flung them\r\nin the fire. He knew he could have got the money back on them, but it\r\nrelieved him to destroy them. Then he went out in search of someone to\r\nbe with. The club was empty. He felt he would go mad unless he found\r\nsomeone to talk to; but Lawson was abroad; he went on to Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrooms: the maid who opened the door told him that he had gone down to\r\nBrighton for the week-end. Then Philip went to a gallery and found it\r\nwas just closing. He did not know what to do. He was distracted. And he\r\nthought of Griffiths and Mildred going to Oxford, sitting opposite one\r\nanother in the train, happy. He went back to his rooms, but they filled\r\nhim with horror, he had been so wretched in them; he tried once more to\r\nread Burton\xe2\x80\x99s book, but, as he read, he told himself again and again\r\nwhat a fool he had been; it was he who had made the suggestion that\r\nthey should go away, he had offered the money, he had forced it upon\r\nthem; he might have known what would happen when he introduced\r\nGriffiths to Mildred; his own vehement passion was enough to arouse the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s desire. By this time they had reached Oxford. They would put up\r\nin one of the lodging-houses in John Street; Philip had never been to\r\nOxford, but Griffiths had talked to him about it so much that he knew\r\nexactly where they would go; and they would dine at the Clarendon:\r\nGriffiths had been in the habit of dining there when he went on the\r\nspree. Philip got himself something to eat in a restaurant near Charing\r\nCross; he had made up his mind to go to a play, and afterwards he\r\nfought his way into the pit of a theatre at which one of Oscar Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npieces was being performed. He wondered if Mildred and Griffiths would\r\ngo to a play that evening: they must kill the evening somehow; they\r\nwere too stupid, both of them to content themselves with conversation:\r\nhe got a fierce delight in reminding himself of the vulgarity of their\r\nminds which suited them so exactly to one another. He watched the play\r\nwith an abstracted mind, trying to give himself gaiety by drinking\r\nwhiskey in each interval; he was unused to alcohol, and it affected him\r\nquickly, but his drunkenness was savage and morose. When the play was\r\nover he had another drink. He could not go to bed, he knew he would not\r\nsleep, and he dreaded the pictures which his vivid imagination would\r\nplace before him. He tried not to think of them. He knew he had drunk\r\ntoo much. Now he was seized with a desire to do horrible, sordid\r\nthings; he wanted to roll himself in gutters; his whole being yearned\r\nfor beastliness; he wanted to grovel.\r\n\r\nHe walked up Piccadilly, dragging his club-foot, sombrely drunk, with\r\nrage and misery clawing at his heart. He was stopped by a painted\r\nharlot, who put her hand on his arm; he pushed her violently away with\r\nbrutal words. He walked on a few steps and then stopped. She would do\r\nas well as another. He was sorry he had spoken so roughly to her. He\r\nwent up to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to hell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI merely wanted to ask if you\xe2\x80\x99d do me the honour of supping with me\r\ntonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with amazement, and hesitated for a while. She saw he\r\nwas drunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was amused that she should use a phrase he had heard so often on\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s lips. He took her to one of the restaurants he had been in\r\nthe habit of going to with Mildred. He noticed as they walked along\r\nthat she looked down at his limb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a club-foot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a cure,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home his bones were aching, and in his head there was a\r\nhammering that made him nearly scream. He took another whiskey and soda\r\nto steady himself, and going to bed sank into a dreamless sleep till\r\nmid-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last Monday came, and Philip thought his long torture was over.\r\nLooking out the trains he found that the latest by which Griffiths\r\ncould reach home that night left Oxford soon after one, and he supposed\r\nthat Mildred would take one which started a few minutes later to bring\r\nher to London. His desire was to go and meet it, but he thought Mildred\r\nwould like to be left alone for a day; perhaps she would drop him a\r\nline in the evening to say she was back, and if not he would call at\r\nher lodgings next morning: his spirit was cowed. He felt a bitter\r\nhatred for Griffiths, but for Mildred, notwithstanding all that had\r\npassed, only a heart-rending desire. He was glad now that Hayward was\r\nnot in London on Saturday afternoon when, distraught, he went in search\r\nof human comfort: he could not have prevented himself from telling him\r\neverything, and Hayward would have been astonished at his weakness. He\r\nwould despise him, and perhaps be shocked or disgusted that he could\r\nenvisage the possibility of making Mildred his mistress after she had\r\ngiven herself to another man. What did he care if it was shocking or\r\ndisgusting? He was ready for any compromise, prepared for more\r\ndegrading humiliations still, if he could only gratify his desire.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening his steps took him against his will to the house in\r\nwhich she lived, and he looked up at her window. It was dark. He did\r\nnot venture to ask if she was back. He was confident in her promise.\r\nBut there was no letter from her in the morning, and, when about\r\nmid-day he called, the maid told him she had not arrived. He could not\r\nunderstand it. He knew that Griffiths would have been obliged to go\r\nhome the day before, for he was to be best man at a wedding, and\r\nMildred had no money. He turned over in his mind every possible thing\r\nthat might have happened. He went again in the afternoon and left a\r\nnote, asking her to dine with him that evening as calmly as though the\r\nevents of the last fortnight had not happened. He mentioned the place\r\nand time at which they were to meet, and hoping against hope kept the\r\nappointment: though he waited for an hour she did not come. On\r\nWednesday morning he was ashamed to ask at the house and sent a\r\nmessenger-boy with a letter and instructions to bring back a reply; but\r\nin an hour the boy came back with Philip\xe2\x80\x99s letter unopened and the\r\nanswer that the lady had not returned from the country. Philip was\r\nbeside himself. The last deception was more than he could bear. He\r\nrepeated to himself over and over again that he loathed Mildred, and,\r\nascribing to Griffiths this new disappointment, he hated him so much\r\nthat he knew what was the delight of murder: he walked about\r\nconsidering what a joy it would be to come upon him on a dark night and\r\nstick a knife into his throat, just about the carotid artery, and leave\r\nhim to die in the street like a dog. Philip was out of his senses with\r\ngrief and rage. He did not like whiskey, but he drank to stupefy\r\nhimself. He went to bed drunk on the Tuesday and on the Wednesday\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning he got up very late and dragged himself, blear-eyed\r\nand sallow, into his sitting-room to see if there were any letters. A\r\ncurious feeling shot through his heart when he recognised the\r\nhandwriting of Griffiths.\r\n\r\nDear old man:\r\n\r\nI hardly know how to write to you and yet I feel I must write. I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not awfully angry with me. I know I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have gone away\r\nwith Milly, but I simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help myself. She simply carried me\r\noff my feet and I would have done anything to get her. When she told me\r\nyou had offered us the money to go I simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist. And now\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all over I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully ashamed of myself and I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nsuch a fool. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d write and say you\xe2\x80\x99re not angry with me, and I\r\nwant you to let me come and see you. I was awfully hurt at your telling\r\nMilly you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see me. Do write me a line, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nchap, and tell me you forgive me. It\xe2\x80\x99ll ease my conscience. I thought\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind or you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have offered the money. But I know I\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have taken it. I came home on Monday and Milly wanted to\r\nstay a couple of days at Oxford by herself. She\xe2\x80\x99s going back to London\r\non Wednesday, so by the time you receive this letter you will have seen\r\nher and I hope everything will go off all right. Do write and say you\r\nforgive me. Please write at once.\r\nYours ever,\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\nPhilip tore up the letter furiously. He did not mean to answer it. He\r\ndespised Griffiths for his apologies, he had no patience with his\r\nprickings of conscience: one could do a dastardly thing if one chose,\r\nbut it was contemptible to regret it afterwards. He thought the letter\r\ncowardly and hypocritical. He was disgusted at its sentimentality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be very easy if you could do a beastly thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cand then say you were sorry, and that put it all right\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hoped with all his heart he would have the chance one day to do\r\nGriffiths a bad turn.\r\n\r\nBut at all events he knew that Mildred was in town. He dressed\r\nhurriedly, not waiting to shave, drank a cup of tea, and took a cab to\r\nher rooms. The cab seemed to crawl. He was painfully anxious to see\r\nher, and unconsciously he uttered a prayer to the God he did not\r\nbelieve in to make her receive him kindly. He only wanted to forget.\r\nWith beating heart he rang the bell. He forgot all his suffering in the\r\npassionate desire to enfold her once more in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mrs. Miller in?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked joyously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d the maid answered.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her blankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came about an hour ago and took away her things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you give her my letter? Did she say where she was going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he understood that Mildred had deceived him again. She was not\r\ncoming back to him. He made an effort to save his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I daresay I shall hear from her. She may have sent a letter\r\nto another address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away and went back hopeless to his rooms. He might have known\r\nthat she would do this; she had never cared for him, she had made a\r\nfool of him from the beginning; she had no pity, she had no kindness,\r\nshe had no charity. The only thing was to accept the inevitable. The\r\npain he was suffering was horrible, he would sooner be dead than endure\r\nit; and the thought came to him that it would be better to finish with\r\nthe whole thing: he might throw himself in the river or put his neck on\r\na railway line; but he had no sooner set the thought into words than he\r\nrebelled against it. His reason told him that he would get over his\r\nunhappiness in time; if he tried with all his might he could forget\r\nher; and it would be grotesque to kill himself on account of a vulgar\r\nslut. He had only one life, and it was madness to fling it away. He\r\nFELT that he would never overcome his passion, but he KNEW that after\r\nall it was only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nHe would not stay in London. There everything reminded him of his\r\nunhappiness. He telegraphed to his uncle that he was coming to\r\nBlackstable, and, hurrying to pack, took the first train he could. He\r\nwanted to get away from the sordid rooms in which he had endured so\r\nmuch suffering. He wanted to breathe clean air. He was disgusted with\r\nhimself. He felt that he was a little mad.\r\n\r\nSince he was grown up Philip had been given the best spare room at the\r\nvicarage. It was a corner-room and in front of one window was an old\r\ntree which blocked the view, but from the other you saw, beyond the\r\ngarden and the vicarage field, broad meadows. Philip remembered the\r\nwall-paper from his earliest years. On the walls were quaint water\r\ncolours of the early Victorian period by a friend of the Vicar\xe2\x80\x99s youth.\r\nThey had a faded charm. The dressing-table was surrounded by stiff\r\nmuslin. There was an old tall-boy to put your clothes in. Philip gave a\r\nsigh of pleasure; he had never realised that all those things meant\r\nanything to him at all. At the vicarage life went on as it had always\r\ndone. No piece of furniture had been moved from one place to another;\r\nthe Vicar ate the same things, said the same things, went for the same\r\nwalk every day; he had grown a little fatter, a little more silent, a\r\nlittle more narrow. He had become accustomed to living without his wife\r\nand missed her very little. He bickered still with Josiah Graves.\r\nPhilip went to see the churchwarden. He was a little thinner, a little\r\nwhiter, a little more austere; he was autocratic still and still\r\ndisapproved of candles on the altar. The shops had still a pleasant\r\nquaintness; and Philip stood in front of that in which things useful to\r\nseamen were sold, sea-boots and tarpaulins and tackle, and remembered\r\nthat he had felt there in his childhood the thrill of the sea and the\r\nadventurous magic of the unknown.\r\n\r\nHe could not help his heart beating at each double knock of the postman\r\nin case there might be a letter from Mildred sent on by his landlady in\r\nLondon; but he knew that there would be none. Now that he could think\r\nit out more calmly he understood that in trying to force Mildred to\r\nlove him he had been attempting the impossible. He did not know what it\r\nwas that passed from a man to a woman, from a woman to a man, and made\r\none of them a slave: it was convenient to call it the sexual instinct;\r\nbut if it was no more than that, he did not understand why it should\r\noccasion so vehement an attraction to one person rather than another.\r\nIt was irresistible: the mind could not battle with it; friendship,\r\ngratitude, interest, had no power beside it. Because he had not\r\nattracted Mildred sexually, nothing that he did had any effect upon\r\nher. The idea revolted him; it made human nature beastly; and he felt\r\nsuddenly that the hearts of men were full of dark places. Because\r\nMildred was indifferent to him he had thought her sexless; her anaemic\r\nappearance and thin lips, the body with its narrow hips and flat chest,\r\nthe languor of her manner, carried out his supposition; and yet she was\r\ncapable of sudden passions which made her willing to risk everything to\r\ngratify them. He had never understood her adventure with Emil Miller:\r\nit had seemed so unlike her, and she had never been able to explain it;\r\nbut now that he had seen her with Griffiths he knew that just the same\r\nthing had happened then: she had been carried off her feet by an\r\nungovernable desire. He tried to think out what those two men had which\r\nso strangely attracted her. They both had a vulgar facetiousness which\r\ntickled her simple sense of humour, and a certain coarseness of nature;\r\nbut what took her perhaps was the blatant sexuality which was their\r\nmost marked characteristic. She had a genteel refinement which\r\nshuddered at the facts of life, she looked upon the bodily functions as\r\nindecent, she had all sorts of euphemisms for common objects, she\r\nalways chose an elaborate word as more becoming than a simple one: the\r\nbrutality of these men was like a whip on her thin white shoulders, and\r\nshe shuddered with voluptuous pain.\r\n\r\nOne thing Philip had made up his mind about. He would not go back to\r\nthe lodgings in which he had suffered. He wrote to his landlady and\r\ngave her notice. He wanted to have his own things about him. He\r\ndetermined to take unfurnished rooms: it would be pleasant and cheaper;\r\nand this was an urgent consideration, for during the last year and a\r\nhalf he had spent nearly seven hundred pounds. He must make up for it\r\nnow by the most rigid economy. Now and then he thought of the future\r\nwith panic; he had been a fool to spend so much money on Mildred; but\r\nhe knew that if it were to come again he would act in the same way. It\r\namused him sometimes to consider that his friends, because he had a\r\nface which did not express his feelings very vividly and a rather slow\r\nway of moving, looked upon him as strong-minded, deliberate, and cool.\r\nThey thought him reasonable and praised his common sense; but he knew\r\nthat his placid expression was no more than a mask, assumed\r\nunconsciously, which acted like the protective colouring of\r\nbutterflies; and himself was astonished at the weakness of his will. It\r\nseemed to him that he was swayed by every light emotion, as though he\r\nwere a leaf in the wind, and when passion seized him he was powerless.\r\nHe had no self-control. He merely seemed to possess it because he was\r\nindifferent to many of the things which moved other people.\r\n\r\nHe considered with some irony the philosophy which he had developed for\r\nhimself, for it had not been of much use to him in the conjuncture he\r\nhad passed through; and he wondered whether thought really helped a man\r\nin any of the critical affairs of life: it seemed to him rather that he\r\nwas swayed by some power alien to and yet within himself, which urged\r\nhim like that great wind of Hell which drove Paolo and Francesca\r\nceaselessly on. He thought of what he was going to do and, when the\r\ntime came to act, he was powerless in the grasp of instincts, emotions,\r\nhe knew not what. He acted as though he were a machine driven by the\r\ntwo forces of his environment and his personality; his reason was\r\nsomeone looking on, observing the facts but powerless to interfere: it\r\nwas like those gods of Epicurus, who saw the doings of men from their\r\nempyrean heights and had no might to alter one smallest particle of\r\nwhat occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip went up to London a couple of days before the session began in\r\norder to find himself rooms. He hunted about the streets that led out\r\nof the Westminster Bridge Road, but their dinginess was distasteful to\r\nhim; and at last he found one in Kennington which had a quiet and\r\nold-world air. It reminded one a little of the London which Thackeray\r\nknew on that side of the river, and in the Kennington Road, through\r\nwhich the great barouche of the Newcomes must have passed as it drove\r\nthe family to the West of London, the plane-trees were bursting into\r\nleaf. The houses in the street which Philip fixed upon were\r\ntwo-storied, and in most of the windows was a notice to state that\r\nlodgings were to let. He knocked at one which announced that the\r\nlodgings were unfurnished, and was shown by an austere, silent woman\r\nfour very small rooms, in one of which there was a kitchen range and a\r\nsink. The rent was nine shillings a week. Philip did not want so many\r\nrooms, but the rent was low and he wished to settle down at once. He\r\nasked the landlady if she could keep the place clean for him and cook\r\nhis breakfast, but she replied that she had enough work to do without\r\nthat; and he was pleased rather than otherwise because she intimated\r\nthat she wished to have nothing more to do with him than to receive his\r\nrent. She told him that, if he inquired at the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s round the\r\ncorner, which was also a post office, he might hear of a woman who\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99 for him.\r\n\r\nPhilip had a little furniture which he had gathered as he went along,\r\nan arm-chair that he had bought in Paris, and a table, a few drawings,\r\nand the small Persian rug which Cronshaw had given him. His uncle had\r\noffered a fold-up bed for which, now that he no longer let his house in\r\nAugust, he had no further use; and by spending another ten pounds\r\nPhilip bought himself whatever else was essential. He spent ten\r\nshillings on putting a corn-coloured paper in the room he was making\r\nhis parlour; and he hung on the walls a sketch which Lawson had given\r\nhim of the Quai des Grands Augustins, and the photograph of the\r\nOdalisque by Ingres and Manet\xe2\x80\x99s Olympia which in Paris had been the\r\nobjects of his contemplation while he shaved. To remind himself that he\r\ntoo had once been engaged in the practice of art, he put up a charcoal\r\ndrawing of the young Spaniard Miguel Ajuria: it was the best thing he\r\nhad ever done, a nude standing with clenched hands, his feet gripping\r\nthe floor with a peculiar force, and on his face that air of\r\ndetermination which had been so impressive; and though Philip after the\r\nlong interval saw very well the defects of his work its associations\r\nmade him look upon it with tolerance. He wondered what had happened to\r\nMiguel. There is nothing so terrible as the pursuit of art by those who\r\nhave no talent. Perhaps, worn out by exposure, starvation, disease, he\r\nhad found an end in some hospital, or in an access of despair had\r\nsought death in the turbid Seine; but perhaps with his Southern\r\ninstability he had given up the struggle of his own accord, and now, a\r\nclerk in some office in Madrid, turned his fervent rhetoric to politics\r\nand bull-fighting.\r\n\r\nPhilip asked Lawson and Hayward to come and see his new rooms, and they\r\ncame, one with a bottle of whiskey, the other with a pate de foie gras;\r\nand he was delighted when they praised his taste. He would have invited\r\nthe Scotch stockbroker too, but he had only three chairs, and thus\r\ncould entertain only a definite number of guests. Lawson was aware that\r\nthrough him Philip had become very friendly with Norah Nesbit and now\r\nremarked that he had run across her a few days before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was asking how you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip flushed at the mention of her name (he could not get himself out\r\nof the awkward habit of reddening when he was embarrassed), and Lawson\r\nlooked at him quizzically. Lawson, who now spent most of the year in\r\nLondon, had so far surrendered to his environment as to wear his hair\r\nshort and to dress himself in a neat serge suit and a bowler hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gather that all is over between you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen her for months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was looking rather nice. She had a very smart hat on with a lot of\r\nwhite ostrich feathers on it. She must be doing pretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip changed the conversation, but he kept thinking of her, and after\r\nan interval, when the three of them were talking of something else, he\r\nasked suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you gather that Norah was angry with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit. She talked very nicely of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got half a mind to go and see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t eat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had thought of Norah often. When Mildred left him his first\r\nthought was of her, and he told himself bitterly that she would never\r\nhave treated him so. His impulse was to go to her; he could depend on\r\nher pity; but he was ashamed: she had been good to him always, and he\r\nhad treated her abominably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d only had the sense to stick to her!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself,\r\nafterwards, when Lawson and Hayward had gone and he was smoking a last\r\npipe before going to bed.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the pleasant hours they had spent together in the cosy\r\nsitting-room in Vincent Square, their visits to galleries and to the\r\nplay, and the charming evenings of intimate conversation. He\r\nrecollected her solicitude for his welfare and her interest in all that\r\nconcerned him. She had loved him with a love that was kind and lasting,\r\nthere was more than sensuality in it, it was almost maternal; he had\r\nalways known that it was a precious thing for which with all his soul\r\nhe should thank the gods. He made up his mind to throw himself on her\r\nmercy. She must have suffered horribly, but he felt she had the\r\ngreatness of heart to forgive him: she was incapable of malice. Should\r\nhe write to her? No. He would break in on her suddenly and cast himself\r\nat her feet\xe2\x80\x94he knew that when the time came he would feel too shy to\r\nperform such a dramatic gesture, but that was how he liked to think of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and tell her that if she would take him back she might rely on him\r\nfor ever. He was cured of the hateful disease from which he had\r\nsuffered, he knew her worth, and now she might trust him. His\r\nimagination leaped forward to the future. He pictured himself rowing\r\nwith her on the river on Sundays; he would take her to Greenwich, he\r\nhad never forgotten that delightful excursion with Hayward, and the\r\nbeauty of the Port of London remained a permanent treasure in his\r\nrecollection; and on the warm summer afternoons they would sit in the\r\nPark together and talk: he laughed to himself as he remembered her gay\r\nchatter, which poured out like a brook bubbling over little stones,\r\namusing, flippant, and full of character. The agony he had suffered\r\nwould pass from his mind like a bad dream.\r\n\r\nBut when next day, about tea-time, an hour at which he was pretty\r\ncertain to find Norah at home, he knocked at her door his courage\r\nsuddenly failed him. Was it possible for her to forgive him? It would\r\nbe abominable of him to force himself on her presence. The door was\r\nopened by a maid new since he had been in the habit of calling every\r\nday, and he inquired if Mrs. Nesbit was in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you ask her if she could see Mr. Carey?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maid ran upstairs and in a moment clattered down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you step up, please, sir. Second floor front.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, with a slight smile.\r\n\r\nHe went with a fluttering heart. He knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the well-known, cheerful voice.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to say come in to a new life of peace and happiness. When he\r\nentered Norah stepped forward to greet him. She shook hands with him as\r\nif they had parted the day before. A man stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Carey\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Kingsford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, bitterly disappointed at not finding her alone, sat down and\r\ntook stock of the stranger. He had never heard her mention his name,\r\nbut he seemed to Philip to occupy his chair as though he were very much\r\nat home. He was a man of forty, clean-shaven, with long fair hair very\r\nneatly plastered down, and the reddish skin and pale, tired eyes which\r\nfair men get when their youth is passed. He had a large nose, a large\r\nmouth; the bones of his face were prominent, and he was heavily made;\r\nhe was a man of more than average height, and broad-shouldered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wondering what had become of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah, in her sprightly\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x9cI met Mr. Lawson the other day\xe2\x80\x94did he tell you?\xe2\x80\x94and I informed\r\nhim that it was really high time you came to see me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip could see no shadow of embarrassment in her countenance, and he\r\nadmired the use with which she carried off an encounter of which\r\nhimself felt the intense awkwardness. She gave him tea. She was about\r\nto put sugar in it when he stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid of me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not believe that. She must remember quite well that he never\r\ntook sugar in his tea. He accepted the incident as a sign that her\r\nnonchalance was affected.\r\n\r\nThe conversation which Philip had interrupted went on, and presently he\r\nbegan to feel a little in the way. Kingsford took no particular notice\r\nof him. He talked fluently and well, not without humour, but with a\r\nslightly dogmatic manner: he was a journalist, it appeared, and had\r\nsomething amusing to say on every topic that was touched upon; but it\r\nexasperated Philip to find himself edged out of the conversation. He\r\nwas determined to stay the visitor out. He wondered if he admired\r\nNorah. In the old days they had often talked of the men who wanted to\r\nflirt with her and had laughed at them together. Philip tried to bring\r\nback the conversation to matters which only he and Norah knew about,\r\nbut each time the journalist broke in and succeeded in drawing it away\r\nto a subject upon which Philip was forced to be silent. He grew faintly\r\nangry with Norah, for she must see he was being made ridiculous; but\r\nperhaps she was inflicting this upon him as a punishment, and with this\r\nthought he regained his good humour. At last, however, the clock struck\r\nsix, and Kingsford got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nNorah shook hands with him, and accompanied him to the landing. She\r\nshut the door behind her and stood outside for a couple of minutes.\r\nPhilip wondered what they were talking about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Mr. Kingsford?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked cheerfully, when she returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s the editor of one of Harmsworth\xe2\x80\x99s Magazines. He\xe2\x80\x99s been taking\r\na good deal of my work lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was never going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you stayed. I wanted to have a talk with you.\xe2\x80\x9d She curled\r\nherself into the large arm-chair, feet and all, in a way her small size\r\nmade possible, and lit a cigarette. He smiled when he saw her assume\r\nthe attitude which had always amused him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look just like a cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a flash of her dark, fine eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really ought to break myself of the habit. It\xe2\x80\x99s absurd to behave\r\nlike a child when you\xe2\x80\x99re my age, but I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable with my legs under\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully jolly to be sitting in this room again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip\r\nhappily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come before?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, reddening.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a look full of kindness. Her lips outlined a charming\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for a moment. His heart beat quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember the last time we met? I treated you awfully badly\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndreadfully ashamed of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him steadily. She did not answer. He was losing his head;\r\nhe seemed to have come on an errand of which he was only now realising\r\nthe outrageousness. She did not help him, and he could only blurt out\r\nbluntly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you ever forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen impetuously he told her that Mildred had left him and that his\r\nunhappiness had been so great that he almost killed himself. He told\r\nher of all that had happened between them, of the birth of the child,\r\nand of the meeting with Griffiths, of his folly and his trust and his\r\nimmense deception. He told her how often he had thought of her kindness\r\nand of her love, and how bitterly he had regretted throwing it away: he\r\nhad only been happy when he was with her, and he knew now how great was\r\nher worth. His voice was hoarse with emotion. Sometimes he was so\r\nashamed of what he was saying that he spoke with his eyes fixed on the\r\nground. His face was distorted with pain, and yet he felt it a strange\r\nrelief to speak. At last he finished. He flung himself back in his\r\nchair, exhausted, and waited. He had concealed nothing, and even, in\r\nhis self-abasement, he had striven to make himself more despicable than\r\nhe had really been. He was surprised that she did not speak, and at\r\nlast he raised his eyes. She was not looking at him. Her face was quite\r\nwhite, and she seemed to be lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you got anything to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started and reddened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a rotten time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dreadfully\r\nsorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed about to go on, but she stopped, and again he waited. At\r\nlength she seemed to force herself to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m engaged to be married to Mr. Kingsford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me at once?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t have allowed\r\nme to humiliate myself before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop you\xe2\x80\xa6. I met him soon after you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she seemed\r\nto search for an expression that should not wound him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctold me your\r\nfriend had come back. I was very wretched for a bit, he was extremely\r\nkind to me. He knew someone had made me suffer, of course he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow it was you, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should have done without him.\r\nAnd suddenly I felt I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on working, working, working; I was\r\nso tired, I felt so ill. I told him about my husband. He offered to\r\ngive me the money to get my divorce if I would marry him as soon as I\r\ncould. He had a very good job, and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be necessary for me to\r\ndo anything unless I wanted to. He was so fond of me and so anxious to\r\ntake care of me. I was awfully touched. And now I\xe2\x80\x99m very, very fond of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got your divorce then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got the decree nisi. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be made absolute in July, and then we\r\nare going to be married at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time Philip did not say anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made such a fool of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered at length.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of his long, humiliating confession. She looked at him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were never really in love with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not very pleasant being in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was always able to recover himself quickly, and, getting up now\r\nand holding out his hand, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very happy. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing that could\r\nhave happened to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked a little wistfully at him as she took his hand and held it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come and see me again, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would make me too envious to see\r\nyou happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly away from her house. After all she was right when she\r\nsaid he had never loved her. He was disappointed, irritated even, but\r\nhis vanity was more affected than his heart. He knew that himself. And\r\npresently he grew conscious that the gods had played a very good\r\npractical joke on him, and he laughed at himself mirthlessly. It is not\r\nvery comfortable to have the gift of being amused at one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the next three months Philip worked on subjects which were new to\r\nhim. The unwieldy crowd which had entered the Medical School nearly two\r\nyears before had thinned out: some had left the hospital, finding the\r\nexaminations more difficult to pass than they expected, some had been\r\ntaken away by parents who had not foreseen the expense of life in\r\nLondon, and some had drifted away to other callings. One youth whom\r\nPhilip knew had devised an ingenious plan to make money; he had bought\r\nthings at sales and pawned them, but presently found it more profitable\r\nto pawn goods bought on credit; and it had caused a little excitement\r\nat the hospital when someone pointed out his name in police-court\r\nproceedings. There had been a remand, then assurances on the part of a\r\nharassed father, and the young man had gone out to bear the White Man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBurden overseas. The imagination of another, a lad who had never before\r\nbeen in a town at all, fell to the glamour of music-halls and bar\r\nparlours; he spent his time among racing-men, tipsters, and trainers,\r\nand now was become a book-maker\xe2\x80\x99s clerk. Philip had seen him once in a\r\nbar near Piccadilly Circus in a tight-waisted coat and a brown hat with\r\na broad, flat brim. A third, with a gift for singing and mimicry, who\r\nhad achieved success at the smoking concerts of the Medical School by\r\nhis imitation of notorious comedians, had abandoned the hospital for\r\nthe chorus of a musical comedy. Still another, and he interested Philip\r\nbecause his uncouth manner and interjectional speech did not suggest\r\nthat he was capable of any deep emotion, had felt himself stifle among\r\nthe houses of London. He grew haggard in shut-in spaces, and the soul\r\nhe knew not he possessed struggled like a sparrow held in the hand,\r\nwith little frightened gasps and a quick palpitation of the heart: he\r\nyearned for the broad skies and the open, desolate places among which\r\nhis childhood had been spent; and he walked off one day, without a word\r\nto anybody, between one lecture and another; and the next thing his\r\nfriends heard was that he had thrown up medicine and was working on a\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nPhilip attended now lectures on medicine and on surgery. On certain\r\nmornings in the week he practised bandaging on out-patients glad to\r\nearn a little money, and he was taught auscultation and how to use the\r\nstethoscope. He learned dispensing. He was taking the examination in\r\nMateria Medica in July, and it amused him to play with various drugs,\r\nconcocting mixtures, rolling pills, and making ointments. He seized\r\navidly upon anything from which he could extract a suggestion of human\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nHe saw Griffiths once in the distance, but, not to have the pain of\r\ncutting him dead, avoided him. Philip had felt a certain\r\nself-consciousness with Griffiths\xe2\x80\x99 friends, some of whom were now\r\nfriends of his, when he realised they knew of his quarrel with\r\nGriffiths and surmised they were aware of the reason. One of them, a\r\nvery tall fellow, with a small head and a languid air, a youth called\r\nRamsden, who was one of Griffiths\xe2\x80\x99 most faithful admirers, copied his\r\nties, his boots, his manner of talking and his gestures, told Philip\r\nthat Griffiths was very much hurt because Philip had not answered his\r\nletter. He wanted to be reconciled with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he asked you to give me the message?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m saying this entirely on my own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsden. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nawfully sorry for what he did, and he says you always behaved like a\r\nperfect brick to him. I know he\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to make it up. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome to the hospital because he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of meeting you, and he thinks\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d cut him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes him feel rather wretched, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bear the trifling inconvenience that he feels with a good deal\r\nof fortitude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything he can to make it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow childish and hysterical! Why should he care? I\xe2\x80\x99m a very\r\ninsignificant person, and he can do very well without my company. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot interested in him any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRamsden thought Philip hard and cold. He paused for a moment or two,\r\nlooking about him in a perplexed way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry wishes to God he\xe2\x80\x99d never had anything to do with the woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with an indifference which he was satisfied with. No one could\r\nhave guessed how violently his heart was beating. He waited impatiently\r\nfor Ramsden to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve quite got over it now, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle by little he discovered the history of Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s relations with\r\nGriffiths. He listened with a smile on his lips, feigning an equanimity\r\nwhich quite deceived the dull-witted boy who talked to him. The\r\nweek-end she spent with Griffiths at Oxford inflamed rather than\r\nextinguished her sudden passion; and when Griffiths went home, with a\r\nfeeling that was unexpected in her she determined to stay in Oxford by\r\nherself for a couple of days, because she had been so happy in it. She\r\nfelt that nothing could induce her to go back to Philip. He revolted\r\nher. Griffiths was taken aback at the fire he had aroused, for he had\r\nfound his two days with her in the country somewhat tedious; and he had\r\nno desire to turn an amusing episode into a tiresome affair. She made\r\nhim promise to write to her, and, being an honest, decent fellow, with\r\nnatural politeness and a desire to make himself pleasant to everybody,\r\nwhen he got home he wrote her a long and charming letter. She answered\r\nit with reams of passion, clumsy, for she had no gift of expression,\r\nill-written, and vulgar; the letter bored him, and when it was followed\r\nnext day by another, and the day after by a third, he began to think\r\nher love no longer flattering but alarming. He did not answer; and she\r\nbombarded him with telegrams, asking him if he were ill and had\r\nreceived her letters; she said his silence made her dreadfully anxious.\r\nHe was forced to write, but he sought to make his reply as casual as\r\nwas possible without being offensive: he begged her not to wire, since\r\nit was difficult to explain telegrams to his mother, an old-fashioned\r\nperson for whom a telegram was still an event to excite tremor. She\r\nanswered by return of post that she must see him and announced her\r\nintention to pawn things (she had the dressing-case which Philip had\r\ngiven her as a wedding-present and could raise eight pounds on that) in\r\norder to come up and stay at the market town four miles from which was\r\nthe village in which his father practised. This frightened Griffiths;\r\nand he, this time, made use of the telegraph wires to tell her that she\r\nmust do nothing of the kind. He promised to let her know the moment he\r\ncame up to London, and, when he did, found that she had already been\r\nasking for him at the hospital at which he had an appointment. He did\r\nnot like this, and, on seeing her, told Mildred that she was not to\r\ncome there on any pretext; and now, after an absence of three weeks, he\r\nfound that she bored him quite decidedly; he wondered why he had ever\r\ntroubled about her, and made up his mind to break with her as soon as\r\nhe could. He was a person who dreaded quarrels, nor did he want to give\r\npain; but at the same time he had other things to do, and he was quite\r\ndetermined not to let Mildred bother him. When he met her he was\r\npleasant, cheerful, amusing, affectionate; he invented convincing\r\nexcuses for the interval since last he had seen her; but he did\r\neverything he could to avoid her. When she forced him to make\r\nappointments he sent telegrams to her at the last moment to put himself\r\noff; and his landlady (the first three months of his appointment he was\r\nspending in rooms) had orders to say he was out when Mildred called.\r\nShe would waylay him in the street and, knowing she had been waiting\r\nabout for him to come out of the hospital for a couple of hours, he\r\nwould give her a few charming, friendly words and bolt off with the\r\nexcuse that he had a business engagement. He grew very skilful in\r\nslipping out of the hospital unseen. Once, when he went back to his\r\nlodgings at midnight, he saw a woman standing at the area railings and\r\nsuspecting who it was went to beg a shake-down in Ramsden\xe2\x80\x99s rooms; next\r\nday the landlady told him that Mildred had sat crying on the doorsteps\r\nfor hours, and she had been obliged to tell her at last that if she did\r\nnot go away she would send for a policeman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsden, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re jolly well out of it. Harry\r\nsays that if he\xe2\x80\x99d suspected for half a second she was going to make\r\nsuch a blooming nuisance of herself he\xe2\x80\x99d have seen himself damned\r\nbefore he had anything to do with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thought of her sitting on that doorstep through the long hours\r\nof the night. He saw her face as she looked up dully at the landlady\r\nwho sent her away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what she\xe2\x80\x99s doing now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99s got a job somewhere, thank God. That keeps her busy all\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last thing he heard, just before the end of the summer session, was\r\nthat Griffiths, urbanity had given way at length under the exasperation\r\nof the constant persecution. He had told Mildred that he was sick of\r\nbeing pestered, and she had better take herself off and not bother him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the only thing he could do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsden. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was getting a\r\nbit too thick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it all over then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen her for ten days. You know, Harry\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful at\r\ndropping people. This is about the toughest nut he\xe2\x80\x99s ever had to crack,\r\nbut he\xe2\x80\x99s cracked it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Philip heard nothing more of her at all. She vanished into the\r\nvast anonymous mass of the population of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the winter session Philip became an out-patients\xe2\x80\x99\r\nclerk. There were three assistant-physicians who took out-patients, two\r\ndays a week each, and Philip put his name down for Dr. Tyrell. He was\r\npopular with the students, and there was some competition to be his\r\nclerk. Dr. Tyrell was a tall, thin man of thirty-five, with a very\r\nsmall head, red hair cut short, and prominent blue eyes: his face was\r\nbright scarlet. He talked well in a pleasant voice, was fond of a\r\nlittle joke, and treated the world lightly. He was a successful man,\r\nwith a large consulting practice and a knighthood in prospect. From\r\ncommerce with students and poor people he had the patronising air, and\r\nfrom dealing always with the sick he had the healthy man\xe2\x80\x99s jovial\r\ncondescension, which some consultants achieve as the professional\r\nmanner. He made the patient feel like a boy confronted by a jolly\r\nschoolmaster; his illness was an absurd piece of naughtiness which\r\namused rather than irritated.\r\n\r\nThe student was supposed to attend in the out-patients\xe2\x80\x99 room every day,\r\nsee cases, and pick up what information he could; but on the days on\r\nwhich he clerked his duties were a little more definite. At that time\r\nthe out-patients\xe2\x80\x99 department at St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s consisted of three rooms,\r\nleading into one another, and a large, dark waiting-room with massive\r\npillars of masonry and long benches. Here the patients waited after\r\nhaving been given their \xe2\x80\x98letters\xe2\x80\x99 at mid-day; and the long rows of\r\nthem, bottles and gallipots in hand, some tattered and dirty, others\r\ndecent enough, sitting in the dimness, men and women of all ages,\r\nchildren, gave one an impression which was weird and horrible. They\r\nsuggested the grim drawings of Daumier. All the rooms were painted\r\nalike, in salmon-colour with a high dado of maroon; and there was in\r\nthem an odour of disinfectants, mingling as the afternoon wore on with\r\nthe crude stench of humanity. The first room was the largest and in the\r\nmiddle of it were a table and an office chair for the physician; on\r\neach side of this were two smaller tables, a little lower: at one of\r\nthese sat the house-physician and at the other the clerk who took the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98book\xe2\x80\x99 for the day. This was a large volume in which were written down\r\nthe name, age, sex, profession, of the patient and the diagnosis of his\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAt half past one the house-physician came in, rang the bell, and told\r\nthe porter to send in the old patients. There were always a good many\r\nof these, and it was necessary to get through as many of them as\r\npossible before Dr. Tyrell came at two. The H.P. with whom Philip came\r\nin contact was a dapper little man, excessively conscious of his\r\nimportance: he treated the clerks with condescension and patently\r\nresented the familiarity of older students who had been his\r\ncontemporaries and did not use him with the respect he felt his present\r\nposition demanded. He set about the cases. A clerk helped him. The\r\npatients streamed in. The men came first. Chronic bronchitis, \xe2\x80\x9ca nasty\r\n\xe2\x80\x99acking cough,\xe2\x80\x9d was what they chiefly suffered from; one went to the\r\nH.P. and the other to the clerk, handing in their letters: if they were\r\ngoing on well the words Rep 14 were written on them, and they went to\r\nthe dispensary with their bottles or gallipots in order to have\r\nmedicine given them for fourteen days more. Some old stagers held back\r\nso that they might be seen by the physician himself, but they seldom\r\nsucceeded in this; and only three or four, whose condition seemed to\r\ndemand his attention, were kept.\r\n\r\nDr. Tyrell came in with quick movements and a breezy manner. He\r\nreminded one slightly of a clown leaping into the arena of a circus\r\nwith the cry: Here we are again. His air seemed to indicate: What\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthis nonsense about being ill? I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon put that right. He took his\r\nseat, asked if there were any old patients for him to see, rapidly\r\npassed them in review, looking at them with shrewd eyes as he discussed\r\ntheir symptoms, cracked a joke (at which all the clerks laughed\r\nheartily) with the H.P., who laughed heartily too but with an air as if\r\nhe thought it was rather impudent for the clerks to laugh, remarked\r\nthat it was a fine day or a hot one, and rang the bell for the porter\r\nto show in the new patients.\r\n\r\nThey came in one by one and walked up to the table at which sat Dr.\r\nTyrell. They were old men and young men and middle-aged men, mostly of\r\nthe labouring class, dock labourers, draymen, factory hands, barmen;\r\nbut some, neatly dressed, were of a station which was obviously\r\nsuperior, shop-assistants, clerks, and the like. Dr. Tyrell looked at\r\nthese with suspicion. Sometimes they put on shabby clothes in order to\r\npretend they were poor; but he had a keen eye to prevent what he\r\nregarded as fraud and sometimes refused to see people who, he thought,\r\ncould well pay for medical attendance. Women were the worst offenders\r\nand they managed the thing more clumsily. They would wear a cloak and a\r\nskirt which were almost in rags, and neglect to take the rings off\r\ntheir fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can afford to wear jewellery you can afford a doctor. A\r\nhospital is a charitable institution,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Tyrell.\r\n\r\nHe handed back the letter and called for the next case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a hang about your letter; you get out. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got no\r\nbusiness to come and steal the time which is wanted by the really\r\npoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe patient retired sulkily, with an angry scowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll probably write a letter to the papers on the gross\r\nmismanagement of the London hospitals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Tyrell, with a smile,\r\nas he took the next paper and gave the patient one of his shrewd\r\nglances.\r\n\r\nMost of them were under the impression that the hospital was an\r\ninstitution of the state, for which they paid out of the rates, and\r\ntook the attendance they received as a right they could claim. They\r\nimagined the physician who gave them his time was heavily paid.\r\n\r\nDr. Tyrell gave each of his clerks a case to examine. The clerk took\r\nthe patient into one of the inner rooms; they were smaller, and each\r\nhad a couch in it covered with black horse-hair: he asked his patient a\r\nvariety of questions, examined his lungs, his heart, and his liver,\r\nmade notes of fact on the hospital letter, formed in his own mind some\r\nidea of the diagnosis, and then waited for Dr. Tyrell to come in. This\r\nhe did, followed by a small crowd of students, when he had finished the\r\nmen, and the clerk read out what he had learned. The physician asked\r\nhim one or two questions, and examined the patient himself. If there\r\nwas anything interesting to hear students applied their stethoscope:\r\nyou would see a man with two or three to the chest, and two perhaps to\r\nhis back, while others waited impatiently to listen. The patient stood\r\namong them a little embarrassed, but not altogether displeased to find\r\nhimself the centre of attention: he listened confusedly while Dr.\r\nTyrell discoursed glibly on the case. Two or three students listened\r\nagain to recognise the murmur or the crepitation which the physician\r\ndescribed, and then the man was told to put on his clothes.\r\n\r\nWhen the various cases had been examined Dr. Tyrell went back into the\r\nlarge room and sat down again at his desk. He asked any student who\r\nhappened to be standing near him what he would prescribe for a patient\r\nhe had just seen. The student mentioned one or two drugs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Tyrell. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s original at all events. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be rash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis always made the students laugh, and with a twinkle of amusement at\r\nhis own bright humour the physician prescribed some other drug than\r\nthat which the student had suggested. When there were two cases of\r\nexactly the same sort and the student proposed the treatment which the\r\nphysician had ordered for the first, Dr. Tyrell exercised considerable\r\ningenuity in thinking of something else. Sometimes, knowing that in the\r\ndispensary they were worked off their legs and preferred to give the\r\nmedicines which they had all ready, the good hospital mixtures which\r\nhad been found by the experience of years to answer their purpose so\r\nwell, he amused himself by writing an elaborate prescription.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll give the dispenser something to do. If we go on prescribing\r\nmist: alb: he\xe2\x80\x99ll lose his cunning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe students laughed, and the doctor gave them a circular glance of\r\nenjoyment in his joke. Then he touched the bell and, when the porter\r\npoked his head in, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld women, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair, chatting with the H.P. while the porter\r\nherded along the old patients. They came in, strings of anaemic girls,\r\nwith large fringes and pallid lips, who could not digest their bad,\r\ninsufficient food; old ladies, fat and thin, aged prematurely by\r\nfrequent confinements, with winter coughs; women with this, that, and\r\nthe other, the matter with them. Dr. Tyrell and his house-physician got\r\nthrough them quickly. Time was getting on, and the air in the small\r\nroom was growing more sickly. The physician looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there many new women today?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good few, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the H.P.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better have them in. You can go on with the old ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey entered. With the men the most common ailments were due to the\r\nexcessive use of alcohol, but with the women they were due to defective\r\nnourishment. By about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock they were finished. Philip, exhausted\r\nby standing all the time, by the bad air, and by the attention he had\r\ngiven, strolled over with his fellow-clerks to the Medical School to\r\nhave tea. He found the work of absorbing interest. There was humanity\r\nthere in the rough, the materials the artist worked on; and Philip felt\r\na curious thrill when it occurred to him that he was in the position of\r\nthe artist and the patients were like clay in his hands. He remembered\r\nwith an amused shrug of the shoulders his life in Paris, absorbed in\r\ncolour, tone, values, Heaven knows what, with the aim of producing\r\nbeautiful things: the directness of contact with men and women gave a\r\nthrill of power which he had never known. He found an endless\r\nexcitement in looking at their faces and hearing them speak; they came\r\nin each with his peculiarity, some shuffling uncouthly, some with a\r\nlittle trip, others with heavy, slow tread, some shyly. Often you could\r\nguess their trades by the look of them. You learnt in what way to put\r\nyour questions so that they should be understood, you discovered on\r\nwhat subjects nearly all lied, and by what inquiries you could extort\r\nthe truth notwithstanding. You saw the different way people took the\r\nsame things. The diagnosis of dangerous illness would be accepted by\r\none with a laugh and a joke, by another with dumb despair. Philip found\r\nthat he was less shy with these people than he had ever been with\r\nothers; he felt not exactly sympathy, for sympathy suggests\r\ncondescension; but he felt at home with them. He found that he was able\r\nto put them at their ease, and, when he had been given a case to find\r\nout what he could about it, it seemed to him that the patient delivered\r\nhimself into his hands with a peculiar confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m cut out to\r\nbe a doctor. It would be rather a lark if I\xe2\x80\x99d hit upon the one thing\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m fit for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Philip that he alone of the clerks saw the dramatic\r\ninterest of those afternoons. To the others men and women were only\r\ncases, good if they were complicated, tiresome if obvious; they heard\r\nmurmurs and were astonished at abnormal livers; an unexpected sound in\r\nthe lungs gave them something to talk about. But to Philip there was\r\nmuch more. He found an interest in just looking at them, in the shape\r\nof their heads and their hands, in the look of their eyes and the\r\nlength of their noses. You saw in that room human nature taken by\r\nsurprise, and often the mask of custom was torn off rudely, showing you\r\nthe soul all raw. Sometimes you saw an untaught stoicism which was\r\nprofoundly moving. Once Philip saw a man, rough and illiterate, told\r\nhis case was hopeless; and, self-controlled himself, he wondered at the\r\nsplendid instinct which forced the fellow to keep a stiff upper-lip\r\nbefore strangers. But was it possible for him to be brave when he was\r\nby himself, face to face with his soul, or would he then surrender to\r\ndespair? Sometimes there was tragedy. Once a young woman brought her\r\nsister to be examined, a girl of eighteen, with delicate features and\r\nlarge blue eyes, fair hair that sparkled with gold when a ray of autumn\r\nsunshine touched it for a moment, and a skin of amazing beauty. The\r\nstudents\xe2\x80\x99 eyes went to her with little smiles. They did not often see a\r\npretty girl in these dingy rooms. The elder woman gave the family\r\nhistory, father and mother had died of phthisis, a brother and a\r\nsister, these two were the only ones left. The girl had been coughing\r\nlately and losing weight. She took off her blouse and the skin of her\r\nneck was like milk. Dr. Tyrell examined her quietly, with his usual\r\nrapid method; he told two or three of his clerks to apply their\r\nstethoscopes to a place he indicated with his finger; and then she was\r\nallowed to dress. The sister was standing a little apart and she spoke\r\nto him in a low voice, so that the girl should not hear. Her voice\r\ntrembled with fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got it, doctor, has she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was the last one. When she goes I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to cry, while the doctor looked at her gravely; he thought\r\nshe too had the type; she would not make old bones either. The girl\r\nturned round and saw her sister\xe2\x80\x99s tears. She understood what they\r\nmeant. The colour fled from her lovely face and tears fell down her\r\ncheeks. The two stood for a minute or two, crying silently, and then\r\nthe older, forgetting the indifferent crowd that watched them, went up\r\nto her, took her in her arms, and rocked her gently to and fro as if\r\nshe were a baby.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone a student asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long d\xe2\x80\x99you think she\xe2\x80\x99ll last, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Tyrell shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer brother and sister died within three months of the first symptoms.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99ll do the same. If they were rich one might do something. You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell these people to go to St. Moritz. Nothing can be done for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce a man who was strong and in all the power of his manhood came\r\nbecause a persistent aching troubled him and his club-doctor did not\r\nseem to do him any good; and the verdict for him too was death, not the\r\ninevitable death that horrified and yet was tolerable because science\r\nwas helpless before it, but the death which was inevitable because the\r\nman was a little wheel in the great machine of a complex civilisation,\r\nand had as little power of changing the circumstances as an automaton.\r\nComplete rest was his only chance. The physician did not ask\r\nimpossibilities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to get some very much lighter job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no light jobs in my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you go on like this you\xe2\x80\x99ll kill yourself. You\xe2\x80\x99re very ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to say that, but you\xe2\x80\x99re certainly unfit for hard\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t work who\xe2\x80\x99s to keep the wife and the kids?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Tyrell shrugged his shoulders. The dilemma had been presented to\r\nhim a hundred times. Time was pressing and there were many patients to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some medicine and you can come back in a week and\r\ntell me how you\xe2\x80\x99re getting on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man took his letter with the useless prescription written upon it\r\nand walked out. The doctor might say what he liked. He did not feel so\r\nbad that he could not go on working. He had a good job and he could not\r\nafford to throw it away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give him a year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Tyrell.\r\n\r\nSometimes there was comedy. Now and then came a flash of cockney\r\nhumour, now and then some old lady, a character such as Charles Dickens\r\nmight have drawn, would amuse them by her garrulous oddities. Once a\r\nwoman came who was a member of the ballet at a famous music-hall. She\r\nlooked fifty, but gave her age as twenty-eight. She was outrageously\r\npainted and ogled the students impudently with large black eyes; her\r\nsmiles were grossly alluring. She had abundant self-confidence and\r\ntreated Dr. Tyrell, vastly amused, with the easy familiarity with which\r\nshe might have used an intoxicated admirer. She had chronic bronchitis,\r\nand told him it hindered her in the exercise of her profession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I should \xe2\x80\x99ave such a thing, upon my word I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never \xe2\x80\x99ad a day\xe2\x80\x99s illness in my life. You\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to look at\r\nme to know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rolled her eyes round the young men, with a long sweep of her\r\npainted eyelashes, and flashed her yellow teeth at them. She spoke with\r\na cockney accent, but with an affectation of refinement which made\r\nevery word a feast of fun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what they call a winter cough,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dr. Tyrell gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\ngreat many middle-aged women have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never! That is a nice thing to say to a lady. No one ever\r\ncalled me middle-aged before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes very wide and cocked her head on one side, looking\r\nat him with indescribable archness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the disadvantage of our profession,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt forces us\r\nsometimes to be ungallant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the prescription and gave him one last, luscious smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will come and see me dance, dearie, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell for the next case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you gentlemen were here to protect me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut on the whole the impression was neither of tragedy nor of comedy.\r\nThere was no describing it. It was manifold and various; there were\r\ntears and laughter, happiness and woe; it was tedious and interesting\r\nand indifferent; it was as you saw it: it was tumultuous and\r\npassionate; it was grave; it was sad and comic; it was trivial; it was\r\nsimple and complex; joy was there and despair; the love of mothers for\r\ntheir children, and of men for women; lust trailed itself through the\r\nrooms with leaden feet, punishing the guilty and the innocent, helpless\r\nwives and wretched children; drink seized men and women and cost its\r\ninevitable price; death sighed in these rooms; and the beginning of\r\nlife, filling some poor girl with terror and shame, was diagnosed\r\nthere. There was neither good nor bad there. There were just facts. It\r\nwas life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year, when Philip was bringing to a close his\r\nthree months as clerk in the out-patients\xe2\x80\x99 department, he received a\r\nletter from Lawson, who was in Paris.\r\n\r\nDear Philip,\r\n\r\nCronshaw is in London and would be glad to see you. He is living at 43\r\nHyde Street, Soho. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where it is, but I daresay you will be\r\nable to find out. Be a brick and look after him a bit. He is very down\r\non his luck. He will tell you what he is doing. Things are going on\r\nhere very much as usual. Nothing seems to have changed since you were\r\nhere. Clutton is back, but he has become quite impossible. He has\r\nquarrelled with everybody. As far as I can make out he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a\r\ncent, he lives in a little studio right away beyond the Jardin des\r\nPlantes, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t let anybody see his work. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show\r\nanywhere, so one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he is doing. He may be a genius, but\r\non the other hand he may be off his head. By the way, I ran against\r\nFlanagan the other day. He was showing Mrs. Flanagan round the Quarter.\r\nHe has chucked art and is now in popper\xe2\x80\x99s business. He seems to be\r\nrolling. Mrs. Flanagan is very pretty and I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to work a\r\nportrait. How much would you ask if you were me? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nfrighten them, and then on the other hand I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be such an\r\nass as to ask L150 if they\xe2\x80\x99re quite willing to give L300.\r\n\r\n                                              Yours ever,\r\n                                                   Frederick Lawson.\r\n\r\nPhilip wrote to Cronshaw and received in reply the following letter. It\r\nwas written on a half-sheet of common note-paper, and the flimsy\r\nenvelope was dirtier than was justified by its passage through the\r\npost.\r\n\r\nDear Carey,\r\n\r\nOf course I remember you very well. I have an idea that I had some part\r\nin rescuing you from the Slough of Despond in which myself am\r\nhopelessly immersed. I shall be glad to see you. I am a stranger in a\r\nstrange city and I am buffeted by the philistines. It will be pleasant\r\nto talk of Paris. I do not ask you to come and see me, since my lodging\r\nis not of a magnificence fit for the reception of an eminent member of\r\nMonsieur Purgon\xe2\x80\x99s profession, but you will find me eating modestly any\r\nevening between seven and eight at a restaurant yclept Au Bon Plaisir\r\nin Dean Street.\r\n\r\n                                          Your sincere\r\n                                                  J. Cronshaw.\r\n\r\nPhilip went the day he received this letter. The restaurant, consisting\r\nof one small room, was of the poorest class, and Cronshaw seemed to be\r\nits only customer. He was sitting in the corner, well away from\r\ndraughts, wearing the same shabby great-coat which Philip had never\r\nseen him without, with his old bowler on his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI eat here because I can be alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are not doing well;\r\nthe only people who come are a few trollops and one or two waiters out\r\nof a job; they are giving up business, and the food is execrable. But\r\nthe ruin of their fortunes is my advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCronshaw had before him a glass of absinthe. It was nearly three years\r\nsince they had met, and Philip was shocked by the change in his\r\nappearance. He had been rather corpulent, but now he had a dried-up,\r\nyellow look: the skin of his neck was loose and winkled; his clothes\r\nhung about him as though they had been bought for someone else; and his\r\ncollar, three or four sizes too large, added to the slatternliness of\r\nhis appearance. His hands trembled continually. Philip remembered the\r\nhandwriting which scrawled over the page with shapeless, haphazard\r\nletters. Cronshaw was evidently very ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI eat little these days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sick in the morning. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\njust having some soup for my dinner, and then I shall have a bit of\r\ncheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s glance unconsciously went to the absinthe, and Cronshaw,\r\nseeing it, gave him the quizzical look with which he reproved the\r\nadmonitions of common sense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have diagnosed my case, and you think it\xe2\x80\x99s very wrong of me to\r\ndrink absinthe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve evidently got cirrhosis of the liver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at Philip in the way which had formerly had the power of\r\nmaking him feel incredibly narrow. It seemed to point out that what he\r\nwas thinking was distressingly obvious; and when you have agreed with\r\nthe obvious what more is there to say? Philip changed the topic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you going back to Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going back to Paris. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe very naturalness with which he said this startled Philip. He\r\nthought of half a dozen things to say, but they seemed futile. He knew\r\nthat Cronshaw was a dying man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to settle in London then?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked lamely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is London to me? I am a fish out of water. I walk through the\r\ncrowded streets, men jostle me, and I seem to walk in a dead city. I\r\nfelt that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t die in Paris. I wanted to die among my own people.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what hidden instinct drew me back at the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip knew of the woman Cronshaw had lived with and the two\r\ndraggle-tailed children, but Cronshaw had never mentioned them to him,\r\nand he did not like to speak of them. He wondered what had happened to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you talk of dying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had pneumonia a couple of winters ago, and they told me then it was\r\na miracle that I came through. It appears I\xe2\x80\x99m extremely liable to it,\r\nand another bout will kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense! You\xe2\x80\x99re not so bad as all that. You\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to\r\ntake precautions. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give up drinking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what a man does if he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nready to take the consequences. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to take the\r\nconsequences. You talk glibly of giving up drinking, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the only\r\nthing I\xe2\x80\x99ve got left now. What do you think life would be to me without\r\nit? Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe? I yearn\r\nfor it; and when I drink it I savour every drop, and afterwards I feel\r\nmy soul swimming in ineffable happiness. It disgusts you. You are a\r\npuritan and in your heart you despise sensual pleasures. Sensual\r\npleasures are the most violent and the most exquisite. I am a man\r\nblessed with vivid senses, and I have indulged them with all my soul. I\r\nhave to pay the penalty now, and I am ready to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at him for a while steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Cronshaw did not answer. He seemed to consider his reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, when I\xe2\x80\x99m alone.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncondemnation? You\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of my fear. It\xe2\x80\x99s folly, the\r\nChristian argument that you should live always in view of your death.\r\nThe only way to live is to forget that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to die. Death is\r\nunimportant. The fear of it should never influence a single action of\r\nthe wise man. I know that I shall die struggling for breath, and I know\r\nthat I shall be horribly afraid. I know that I shall not be able to\r\nkeep myself from regretting bitterly the life that has brought me to\r\nsuch a pass; but I disown that regret. I now, weak, old, diseased,\r\npoor, dying, hold still my soul in my hands, and I regret nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember that Persian carpet you gave me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\nCronshaw smiled his old, slow smile of past days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you that it would give you an answer to your question when you\r\nasked me what was the meaning of life. Well, have you discovered the\r\nanswer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell it me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. The answer is meaningless unless you discover\r\nit for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCronshaw was publishing his poems. His friends had been urging him to\r\ndo this for years, but his laziness made it impossible for him to take\r\nthe necessary steps. He had always answered their exhortations by\r\ntelling them that the love of poetry was dead in England. You brought\r\nout a book which had cost you years of thought and labour; it was given\r\ntwo or three contemptuous lines among a batch of similar volumes,\r\ntwenty or thirty copies were sold, and the rest of the edition was\r\npulped. He had long since worn out the desire for fame. That was an\r\nillusion like all else. But one of his friends had taken the matter\r\ninto his own hands. This was a man of letters, named Leonard Upjohn,\r\nwhom Philip had met once or twice with Cronshaw in the cafes of the\r\nQuarter. He had a considerable reputation in England as a critic and\r\nwas the accredited exponent in this country of modern French\r\nliterature. He had lived a good deal in France among the men who made\r\nthe Mercure de France the liveliest review of the day, and by the\r\nsimple process of expressing in English their point of view he had\r\nacquired in England a reputation for originality. Philip had read some\r\nof his articles. He had formed a style for himself by a close imitation\r\nof Sir Thomas Browne; he used elaborate sentences, carefully balanced,\r\nand obsolete, resplendent words: it gave his writing an appearance of\r\nindividuality. Leonard Upjohn had induced Cronshaw to give him all his\r\npoems and found that there were enough to make a volume of reasonable\r\nsize. He promised to use his influence with publishers. Cronshaw was in\r\nwant of money. Since his illness he had found it more difficult than\r\never to work steadily; he made barely enough to keep himself in liquor;\r\nand when Upjohn wrote to him that this publisher and the other, though\r\nadmiring the poems, thought it not worth while to publish them,\r\nCronshaw began to grow interested. He wrote impressing upon Upjohn his\r\ngreat need and urging him to make more strenuous efforts. Now that he\r\nwas going to die he wanted to leave behind him a published book, and at\r\nthe back of his mind was the feeling that he had produced great poetry.\r\nHe expected to burst upon the world like a new star. There was\r\nsomething fine in keeping to himself these treasures of beauty all his\r\nlife and giving them to the world disdainfully when, he and the world\r\nparting company, he had no further use for them.\r\n\r\nHis decision to come to England was caused directly by an announcement\r\nfrom Leonard Upjohn that a publisher had consented to print the poems.\r\nBy a miracle of persuasion Upjohn had persuaded him to give ten pounds\r\nin advance of royalties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn advance of royalties, mind you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronshaw to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cMilton\r\nonly got ten pounds down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpjohn had promised to write a signed article about them, and he would\r\nask his friends who reviewed to do their best. Cronshaw pretended to\r\ntreat the matter with detachment, but it was easy to see that he was\r\ndelighted with the thought of the stir he would make.\r\n\r\nOne day Philip went to dine by arrangement at the wretched eating-house\r\nat which Cronshaw insisted on taking his meals, but Cronshaw did not\r\nappear. Philip learned that he had not been there for three days. He\r\ngot himself something to eat and went round to the address from which\r\nCronshaw had first written to him. He had some difficulty in finding\r\nHyde Street. It was a street of dingy houses huddled together; many of\r\nthe windows had been broken and were clumsily repaired with strips of\r\nFrench newspaper; the doors had not been painted for years; there were\r\nshabby little shops on the ground floor, laundries, cobblers,\r\nstationers. Ragged children played in the road, and an old barrel-organ\r\nwas grinding out a vulgar tune. Philip knocked at the door of\r\nCronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s house (there was a shop of cheap sweetstuffs at the bottom),\r\nand it was opened by an elderly Frenchwoman in a dirty apron. Philip\r\nasked her if Cronshaw was in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, there is an Englishman who lives at the top, at the back. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s in. If you want him you had better go up and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe staircase was lit by one jet of gas. There was a revolting odour in\r\nthe house. When Philip was passing up a woman came out of a room on the\r\nfirst floor, looked at him suspiciously, but made no remark. There were\r\nthree doors on the top landing. Philip knocked at one, and knocked\r\nagain; there was no reply; he tried the handle, but the door was\r\nlocked. He knocked at another door, got no answer, and tried the door\r\nagain. It opened. The room was dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe recognised Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarey. Can I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe received no answer. He walked in. The window was closed and the\r\nstink was overpowering. There was a certain amount of light from the\r\narc-lamp in the street, and he saw that it was a small room with two\r\nbeds in it, end to end; there was a washing-stand and one chair, but\r\nthey left little space for anyone to move in. Cronshaw was in the bed\r\nnearest the window. He made no movement, but gave a low chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you light the candle?\xe2\x80\x9d he said then.\r\n\r\nPhilip struck a match and discovered that there was a candlestick on\r\nthe floor beside the bed. He lit it and put it on the washing-stand.\r\nCronshaw was lying on his back immobile; he looked very odd in his\r\nnightshirt; and his baldness was disconcerting. His face was earthy and\r\ndeath-like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, old man, you look awfully ill. Is there anyone to look after\r\nyou here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge brings me in a bottle of milk in the morning before he goes to\r\nhis work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call him George because his name is Adolphe. He shares this palatial\r\napartment with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip noticed then that the second bed had not been made since it was\r\nslept in. The pillow was black where the head had rested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99re sharing this room with somebody else?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Lodging costs money in Soho. George is a waiter, he goes out\r\nat eight in the morning and does not come in till closing time, so he\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t in my way at all. We neither of us sleep well, and he helps to\r\npass away the hours of the night by telling me stories of his life.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a Swiss, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a taste for waiters. They see life\r\nfrom an entertaining angle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been in bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99ve had nothing but a bottle of milk for the last\r\nthree days? Why on earth didn\xe2\x80\x99t you send me a line? I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to\r\nthink of you lying here all day long without a soul to attend to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCronshaw gave a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at your face. Why, dear boy, I really believe you\xe2\x80\x99re distressed.\r\nYou nice fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip blushed. He had not suspected that his face showed the dismay he\r\nfelt at the sight of that horrible room and the wretched circumstances\r\nof the poor poet. Cronshaw, watching Philip, went on with a gentle\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite happy. Look, here are my proofs. Remember that I am\r\nindifferent to discomforts which would harass other folk. What do the\r\ncircumstances of life matter if your dreams make you lord paramount of\r\ntime and space?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proofs were lying on his bed, and as he lay in the darkness he had\r\nbeen able to place his hands on them. He showed them to Philip and his\r\neyes glowed. He turned over the pages, rejoicing in the clear type; he\r\nread out a stanza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t look bad, do they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had an idea. It would involve him in a little expense and he\r\ncould not afford even the smallest increase of expenditure; but on the\r\nother hand this was a case where it revolted him to think of economy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the thought of your remaining here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an\r\nextra room, it\xe2\x80\x99s empty at present, but I can easily get someone to lend\r\nme a bed. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come and live with me for a while? It\xe2\x80\x99ll save you\r\nthe rent of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear boy, you\xe2\x80\x99d insist on my keeping my window open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have every window in the place sealed if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be all right tomorrow. I could have got up today, only I felt\r\nlazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you can very easily make the move. And then if you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\nwell at any time you can just go to bed, and I shall be there to look\r\nafter you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99ll please you I\xe2\x80\x99ll come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cronshaw, with his torpid not\r\nunpleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll be ripping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey settled that Philip should fetch Cronshaw next day, and Philip\r\nsnatched an hour from his busy morning to arrange the change. He found\r\nCronshaw dressed, sitting in his hat and great-coat on the bed, with a\r\nsmall, shabby portmanteau, containing his clothes and books, already\r\npacked: it was on the floor by his feet, and he looked as if he were\r\nsitting in the waiting-room of a station. Philip laughed at the sight\r\nof him. They went over to Kennington in a four-wheeler, of which the\r\nwindows were carefully closed, and Philip installed his guest in his\r\nown room. He had gone out early in the morning and bought for himself a\r\nsecond-hand bedstead, a cheap chest of drawers, and a looking-glass.\r\nCronshaw settled down at once to correct his proofs. He was much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nPhilip found him, except for the irritability which was a symptom of\r\nhis disease, an easy guest. He had a lecture at nine in the morning, so\r\ndid not see Cronshaw till the night. Once or twice Philip persuaded him\r\nto share the scrappy meal he prepared for himself in the evening, but\r\nCronshaw was too restless to stay in, and preferred generally to get\r\nhimself something to eat in one or other of the cheapest restaurants in\r\nSoho. Philip asked him to see Dr. Tyrell, but he stoutly refused; he\r\nknew a doctor would tell him to stop drinking, and this he was resolved\r\nnot to do. He always felt horribly ill in the morning, but his absinthe\r\nat mid-day put him on his feet again, and by the time he came home, at\r\nmidnight, he was able to talk with the brilliancy which had astonished\r\nPhilip when first he made his acquaintance. His proofs were corrected;\r\nand the volume was to come out among the publications of the early\r\nspring, when the public might be supposed to have recovered from the\r\navalanche of Christmas books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the new year Philip became dresser in the surgical out-patients\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndepartment. The work was of the same character as that which he had\r\njust been engaged on, but with the greater directness which surgery has\r\nthan medicine; and a larger proportion of the patients suffered from\r\nthose two diseases which a supine public allows, in its prudishness, to\r\nbe spread broadcast. The assistant-surgeon for whom Philip dressed was\r\ncalled Jacobs. He was a short, fat man, with an exuberant joviality, a\r\nbald head, and a loud voice; he had a cockney accent, and was generally\r\ndescribed by the students as an \xe2\x80\x98awful bounder\xe2\x80\x99; but his cleverness,\r\nboth as a surgeon and as a teacher, caused some of them to overlook\r\nthis. He had also a considerable facetiousness, which he exercised\r\nimpartially on the patients and on the students. He took a great\r\npleasure in making his dressers look foolish. Since they were ignorant,\r\nnervous, and could not answer as if he were their equal, this was not\r\nvery difficult. He enjoyed his afternoons, with the home truths he\r\npermitted himself, much more than the students who had to put up with\r\nthem with a smile. One day a case came up of a boy with a club-foot.\r\nHis parents wanted to know whether anything could be done. Mr. Jacobs\r\nturned to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better take this case, Carey. It\xe2\x80\x99s a subject you ought to know\r\nsomething about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip flushed, all the more because the surgeon spoke obviously with a\r\nhumorous intention, and his brow-beaten dressers laughed obsequiously.\r\nIt was in point of fact a subject which Philip, since coming to the\r\nhospital, had studied with anxious attention. He had read everything in\r\nthe library which treated of talipes in its various forms. He made the\r\nboy take off his boot and stocking. He was fourteen, with a snub nose,\r\nblue eyes, and a freckled face. His father explained that they wanted\r\nsomething done if possible, it was such a hindrance to the kid in\r\nearning his living. Philip looked at him curiously. He was a jolly boy,\r\nnot at all shy, but talkative and with a cheekiness which his father\r\nreproved. He was much interested in his foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only for the looks of the thing, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t find it no trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, Ernie,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s too much gas about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip examined the foot and passed his hand slowly over the\r\nshapelessness of it. He could not understand why the boy felt none of\r\nthe humiliation which always oppressed himself. He wondered why he\r\ncould not take his deformity with that philosophic indifference.\r\nPresently Mr. Jacobs came up to him. The boy was sitting on the edge of\r\na couch, the surgeon and Philip stood on each side of him; and in a\r\nsemi-circle, crowding round, were students. With accustomed brilliancy\r\nJacobs gave a graphic little discourse upon the club-foot: he spoke of\r\nits varieties and of the forms which followed upon different anatomical\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve got talipes equinus?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning suddenly to\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt the eyes of his fellow-students rest on him, and he cursed\r\nhimself because he could not help blushing. He felt the sweat start up\r\nin the palms of his hands. The surgeon spoke with the fluency due to\r\nlong practice and with the admirable perspicacity which distinguished\r\nhim. He was tremendously interested in his profession. But Philip did\r\nnot listen. He was only wishing that the fellow would get done quickly.\r\nSuddenly he realised that Jacobs was addressing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind taking off your sock for a moment, Carey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt a shudder pass through him. He had an impulse to tell the\r\nsurgeon to go to hell, but he had not the courage to make a scene. He\r\nfeared his brutal ridicule. He forced himself to appear indifferent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and unlaced his boot. His fingers were trembling and he\r\nthought he should never untie the knot. He remembered how they had\r\nforced him at school to show his foot, and the misery which had eaten\r\ninto his soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps his feet nice and clean, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacobs, in his\r\nrasping, cockney voice.\r\n\r\nThe attendant students giggled. Philip noticed that the boy whom they\r\nwere examining looked down at his foot with eager curiosity. Jacobs\r\ntook the foot in his hands and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought. I see you\xe2\x80\x99ve had an operation. When you\r\nwere a child, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on with his fluent explanations. The students leaned over and\r\nlooked at the foot. Two or three examined it minutely when Jacobs let\r\nit go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve quite done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, with a smile, ironically.\r\n\r\nHe could have killed them all. He thought how jolly it would be to jab\r\na chisel (he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why that particular instrument came into his\r\nmind) into their necks. What beasts men were! He wished he could\r\nbelieve in hell so as to comfort himself with the thought of the\r\nhorrible tortures which would be theirs. Mr. Jacobs turned his\r\nattention to treatment. He talked partly to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s father and partly\r\nto the students. Philip put on his sock and laced his boot. At last the\r\nsurgeon finished. But he seemed to have an afterthought and turned to\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I think it might be worth your while to have an operation.\r\nOf course I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you a normal foot, but I think I can do\r\nsomething. You might think about it, and when you want a holiday you\r\ncan just come into the hospital for a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had often asked himself whether anything could be done, but his\r\ndistaste for any reference to the subject had prevented him from\r\nconsulting any of the surgeons at the hospital. His reading told him\r\nthat whatever might have been done when he was a small boy, and then\r\ntreatment of talipes was not as skilful as in the present day, there\r\nwas small chance now of any great benefit. Still it would be worth\r\nwhile if an operation made it possible for him to wear a more ordinary\r\nboot and to limp less. He remembered how passionately he had prayed for\r\nthe miracle which his uncle had assured him was possible to\r\nomnipotence. He smiled ruefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was rather a simple soul in those days,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of February it was clear that Cronshaw was growing much\r\nworse. He was no longer able to get up. He lay in bed, insisting that\r\nthe window should be closed always, and refused to see a doctor; he\r\nwould take little nourishment, but demanded whiskey and cigarettes:\r\nPhilip knew that he should have neither, but Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s argument was\r\nunanswerable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay they are killing me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. You\xe2\x80\x99ve warned me, you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone all that was necessary: I ignore your warning. Give me something\r\nto drink and be damned to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeonard Upjohn blew in two or three times a week, and there was\r\nsomething of the dead leaf in his appearance which made the word\r\nexactly descriptive of the manner of his appearance. He was a\r\nweedy-looking fellow of five-and-thirty, with long pale hair and a\r\nwhite face; he had the look of a man who lived too little in the open\r\nair. He wore a hat like a dissenting minister\xe2\x80\x99s. Philip disliked him\r\nfor his patronising manner and was bored by his fluent conversation.\r\nLeonard Upjohn liked to hear himself talk. He was not sensitive to the\r\ninterest of his listeners, which is the first requisite of the good\r\ntalker; and he never realised that he was telling people what they knew\r\nalready. With measured words he told Philip what to think of Rodin,\r\nAlbert Samain, and Caesar Franck. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s charwoman only came in for\r\nan hour in the morning, and since Philip was obliged to be at the\r\nhospital all day Cronshaw was left much alone. Upjohn told Philip that\r\nhe thought someone should remain with him, but did not offer to make it\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful to think of that great poet alone. Why, he might die\r\nwithout a soul at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he very probably will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be so callous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you come and do your work here every day, and then you\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nnear if he wanted anything?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? My dear fellow, I can only work in the surroundings I\xe2\x80\x99m used to,\r\nand besides I go out so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpjohn was also a little put out because Philip had brought Cronshaw to\r\nhis own rooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had left him in Soho,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a wave of his long,\r\nthin hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a touch of romance in that sordid attic. I could\r\neven bear it if it were Wapping or Shoreditch, but the respectability\r\nof Kennington! What a place for a poet to die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCronshaw was often so ill-humoured that Philip could only keep his\r\ntemper by remembering all the time that this irritability was a symptom\r\nof the disease. Upjohn came sometimes before Philip was in, and then\r\nCronshaw would complain of him bitterly. Upjohn listened with\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that Carey has no sense of beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a\r\nmiddle-class mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very sarcastic to Philip, and Philip exercised a good deal of\r\nself-control in his dealings with him. But one evening he could not\r\ncontain himself. He had had a hard day at the hospital and was tired\r\nout. Leonard Upjohn came to him, while he was making himself a cup of\r\ntea in the kitchen, and said that Cronshaw was complaining of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninsistence that he should have a doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you realise that you\xe2\x80\x99re enjoying a very rare, a very exquisite\r\nprivilege? You ought to do everything in your power, surely, to show\r\nyour sense of the greatness of your trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a rare and exquisite privilege which I can ill afford,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\nWhenever there was any question of money, Leonard Upjohn assumed a\r\nslightly disdainful expression. His sensitive temperament was offended\r\nby the reference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something fine in Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s attitude, and you disturb it by\r\nyour importunity. You should make allowances for the delicate\r\nimaginings which you cannot feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s face darkened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go in to Cronshaw,\xe2\x80\x9d he said frigidly.\r\n\r\nThe poet was lying on his back, reading a book, with a pipe in his\r\nmouth. The air was musty; and the room, notwithstanding Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntidying up, had the bedraggled look which seemed to accompany Cronshaw\r\nwherever he went. He took off his spectacles as they came in. Philip\r\nwas in a towering rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpjohn tells me you\xe2\x80\x99ve been complaining to him because I\xe2\x80\x99ve urged you\r\nto have a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to have a doctor, because you\r\nmay die any day, and if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been seen by anyone I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nable to get a certificate. There\xe2\x80\x99d have to be an inquest and I should\r\nbe blamed for not calling a doctor in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that. I thought you wanted me to see a doctor for\r\nmy sake and not for your own. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see a doctor whenever you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not answer, but gave an almost imperceptible shrug of the\r\nshoulders. Cronshaw, watching him, gave a little chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look so angry, my dear. I know very well you want to do\r\neverything you can for me. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see your doctor, perhaps he can do\r\nsomething for me, and at any rate it\xe2\x80\x99ll comfort you.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned his\r\neyes to Upjohn. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a damned fool, Leonard. Why d\xe2\x80\x99you want to worry\r\nthe boy? He has quite enough to do to put up with me. You\xe2\x80\x99ll do nothing\r\nmore for me than write a pretty article about me after my death. I know\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext day Philip went to Dr. Tyrell. He felt that he was the sort of man\r\nto be interested by the story, and as soon as Tyrell was free of his\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work he accompanied Philip to Kennington. He could only agree\r\nwith what Philip had told him. The case was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take him into the hospital if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can have a\r\nsmall ward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing would induce him to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, he may die any minute, or else he may get another attack of\r\npneumonia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip nodded. Dr. Tyrell made one or two suggestions, and promised to\r\ncome again whenever Philip wanted him to. He left his address. When\r\nPhilip went back to Cronshaw he found him quietly reading. He did not\r\ntrouble to inquire what the doctor had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you satisfied now, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose nothing will induce you to do any of the things Tyrell\r\nadvised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Cronshaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after this Philip, going home one evening after his\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work at the hospital, knocked at the door of Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s room. He\r\ngot no answer and walked in. Cronshaw was lying huddled up on one side,\r\nand Philip went up to the bed. He did not know whether Cronshaw was\r\nasleep or merely lay there in one of his uncontrollable fits of\r\nirritability. He was surprised to see that his mouth was open. He\r\ntouched his shoulder. Philip gave a cry of dismay. He slipped his hand\r\nunder Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s shirt and felt his heart; he did not know what to do;\r\nhelplessly, because he had heard of this being done, he held a\r\nlooking-glass in front of his mouth. It startled him to be alone with\r\nCronshaw. He had his hat and coat still on, and he ran down the stairs\r\ninto the street; he hailed a cab and drove to Harley Street. Dr. Tyrell\r\nwas in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, would you mind coming at once? I think Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is it\xe2\x80\x99s not much good my coming, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be awfully grateful if you would. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a cab at the door.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll only take half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTyrell put on his hat. In the cab he asked him one or two questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed no worse than usual when I left this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt gave me an awful shock when I went in just now. And the thought of\r\nhis dying all alone\xe2\x80\xa6. D\xe2\x80\x99you think he knew he was going to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip remembered what Cronshaw had said. He wondered whether at that\r\nlast moment he had been seized with the terror of death. Philip\r\nimagined himself in such a plight, knowing it was inevitable and with\r\nno one, not a soul, to give an encouraging word when the fear seized\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re rather upset,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Tyrell.\r\n\r\nHe looked at him with his bright blue eyes. They were not\r\nunsympathetic. When he saw Cronshaw, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been dead for some hours. I should think he died in his\r\nsleep. They do sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe body looked shrunk and ignoble. It was not like anything human. Dr.\r\nTyrell looked at it dispassionately. With a mechanical gesture he took\r\nout his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must be getting along. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send the certificate round. I\r\nsuppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll communicate with the relatives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are any,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about the funeral?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Tyrell gave Philip a glance. He wondered whether he ought to offer\r\na couple of sovereigns towards it. He knew nothing of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncircumstances; perhaps he could well afford the expense; Philip might\r\nthink it impertinent if he made any suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let me know if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I can do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPhilip and he went out together, parting on the doorstep, and Philip\r\nwent to a telegraph office in order to send a message to Leonard\r\nUpjohn. Then he went to an undertaker whose shop he passed every day on\r\nhis way to the hospital. His attention had been drawn to it often by\r\nthe three words in silver lettering on a black cloth, which, with two\r\nmodel coffins, adorned the window: Economy, Celerity, Propriety. They\r\nhad always diverted him. The undertaker was a little fat Jew with curly\r\nblack hair, long and greasy, in black, with a large diamond ring on a\r\npodgy finger. He received Philip with a peculiar manner formed by the\r\nmingling of his natural blatancy with the subdued air proper to his\r\ncalling. He quickly saw that Philip was very helpless and promised to\r\nsend round a woman at once to perform the needful offices. His\r\nsuggestions for the funeral were very magnificent; and Philip felt\r\nashamed of himself when the undertaker seemed to think his objections\r\nmean. It was horrible to haggle on such a matter, and finally Philip\r\nconsented to an expensiveness which he could ill afford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t want any\r\nshow and that\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not a believer in ostentation myself, mind you\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nyou want it done gentlemanly-like. You leave it to me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it as\r\ncheap as it can be done, \xe2\x80\x99aving regard to what\xe2\x80\x99s right and proper. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say more than that, can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip went home to eat his supper, and while he ate the woman came\r\nalong to lay out the corpse. Presently a telegram arrived from Leonard\r\nUpjohn.\r\n\r\nShocked and grieved beyond measure. Regret cannot come tonight. Dining\r\nout. With you early tomorrow. Deepest sympathy. Upjohn.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the woman knocked at the door of the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done now, sir. Will you come and look at \xe2\x80\x99im and see it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip followed her. Cronshaw was lying on his back, with his eyes\r\nclosed and his hands folded piously across his chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought by rights to \xe2\x80\x99ave a few flowers, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get some tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave the body a glance of satisfaction. She had performed her job,\r\nand now she rolled down her sleeves, took off her apron, and put on her\r\nbonnet. Philip asked her how much he owed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, some give me two and sixpence and some give me five\r\nshillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was ashamed to give her less than the larger sum. She thanked\r\nhim with just so much effusiveness as was seemly in presence of the\r\ngrief he might be supposed to feel, and left him. Philip went back into\r\nhis sitting-room, cleared away the remains of his supper, and sat down\r\nto read Walsham\xe2\x80\x99s Surgery. He found it difficult. He felt singularly\r\nnervous. When there was a sound on the stairs he jumped, and his heart\r\nbeat violently. That thing in the adjoining room, which had been a man\r\nand now was nothing, frightened him. The silence seemed alive, as if\r\nsome mysterious movement were taking place within it; the presence of\r\ndeath weighed upon these rooms, unearthly and terrifying: Philip felt a\r\nsudden horror for what had once been his friend. He tried to force\r\nhimself to read, but presently pushed away his book in despair. What\r\ntroubled him was the absolute futility of the life which had just\r\nended. It did not matter if Cronshaw was alive or dead. It would have\r\nbeen just as well if he had never lived. Philip thought of Cronshaw\r\nyoung; and it needed an effort of imagination to picture him slender,\r\nwith a springing step, and with hair on his head, buoyant and hopeful.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s rule of life, to follow one\xe2\x80\x99s instincts with due regard to the\r\npoliceman round the corner, had not acted very well there: it was\r\nbecause Cronshaw had done this that he had made such a lamentable\r\nfailure of existence. It seemed that the instincts could not be\r\ntrusted. Philip was puzzled, and he asked himself what rule of life was\r\nthere, if that one was useless, and why people acted in one way rather\r\nthan in another. They acted according to their emotions, but their\r\nemotions might be good or bad; it seemed just a chance whether they led\r\nto triumph or disaster. Life seemed an inextricable confusion. Men\r\nhurried hither and thither, urged by forces they knew not; and the\r\npurpose of it all escaped them; they seemed to hurry just for\r\nhurrying\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nNext morning Leonard Upjohn appeared with a small wreath of laurel. He\r\nwas pleased with his idea of crowning the dead poet with this; and\r\nattempted, notwithstanding Philip\xe2\x80\x99s disapproving silence, to fix it on\r\nthe bald head; but the wreath fitted grotesquely. It looked like the\r\nbrim of a hat worn by a low comedian in a music-hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put it over his heart instead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Upjohn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve put it on his stomach,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Philip.\r\n\r\nUpjohn gave a thin smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a poet knows where lies a poet\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nThey went back into the sitting-room, and Philip told him what\r\narrangements he had made for the funeral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped you\xe2\x80\x99ve spared no expense. I should like the hearse to be\r\nfollowed by a long string of empty coaches, and I should like the\r\nhorses to wear tall nodding plumes, and there should be a vast number\r\nof mutes with long streamers on their hats. I like the thought of all\r\nthose empty coaches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the cost of the funeral will apparently fall on me and I\xe2\x80\x99m not over\r\nflush just now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make it as moderate as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear fellow, in that case, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you get him a pauper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuneral? There would have been something poetic in that. You have an\r\nunerring instinct for mediocrity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip flushed a little, but did not answer; and next day he and Upjohn\r\nfollowed the hearse in the one carriage which Philip had ordered.\r\nLawson, unable to come, had sent a wreath; and Philip, so that the\r\ncoffin should not seem too neglected, had bought a couple. On the way\r\nback the coachman whipped up his horses. Philip was dog-tired and\r\npresently went to sleep. He was awakened by Upjohn\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather lucky the poems haven\xe2\x80\x99t come out yet. I think we\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nhold them back a bit and I\xe2\x80\x99ll write a preface. I began thinking of it\r\nduring the drive to the cemetery. I believe I can do something rather\r\ngood. Anyhow I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with an article in The Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not reply, and there was silence between them. At last\r\nUpjohn said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay I\xe2\x80\x99d be wiser not to whittle away my copy. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll do an\r\narticle for one of the reviews, and then I can just print it afterwards\r\nas a preface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip kept his eye on the monthlies, and a few weeks later it\r\nappeared. The article made something of a stir, and extracts from it\r\nwere printed in many of the papers. It was a very good article, vaguely\r\nbiographical, for no one knew much of Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s early life, but\r\ndelicate, tender, and picturesque. Leonard Upjohn in his intricate\r\nstyle drew graceful little pictures of Cronshaw in the Latin Quarter,\r\ntalking, writing poetry: Cronshaw became a picturesque figure, an\r\nEnglish Verlaine; and Leonard Upjohn\xe2\x80\x99s coloured phrases took on a\r\ntremulous dignity, a more pathetic grandiloquence, as he described the\r\nsordid end, the shabby little room in Soho; and, with a reticence which\r\nwas wholly charming and suggested a much greater generosity than\r\nmodesty allowed him to state, the efforts he made to transport the Poet\r\nto some cottage embowered with honeysuckle amid a flowering orchard.\r\nAnd the lack of sympathy, well-meaning but so tactless, which had taken\r\nthe poet instead to the vulgar respectability of Kennington! Leonard\r\nUpjohn described Kennington with that restrained humour which a strict\r\nadherence to the vocabulary of Sir Thomas Browne necessitated. With\r\ndelicate sarcasm he narrated the last weeks, the patience with which\r\nCronshaw bore the well-meaning clumsiness of the young student who had\r\nappointed himself his nurse, and the pitifulness of that divine\r\nvagabond in those hopelessly middle-class surroundings. Beauty from\r\nashes, he quoted from Isaiah. It was a triumph of irony for that\r\noutcast poet to die amid the trappings of vulgar respectability; it\r\nreminded Leonard Upjohn of Christ among the Pharisees, and the analogy\r\ngave him opportunity for an exquisite passage. And then he told how a\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94his good taste did not suffer him more than to hint subtly who\r\nthe friend was with such gracious fancies\xe2\x80\x94had laid a laurel wreath on\r\nthe dead poet\xe2\x80\x99s heart; and the beautiful dead hands had seemed to rest\r\nwith a voluptuous passion upon Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s leaves, fragrant with the\r\nfragrance of art, and more green than jade brought by swart mariners\r\nfrom the manifold, inexplicable China. And, an admirable contrast, the\r\narticle ended with a description of the middle-class, ordinary, prosaic\r\nfuneral of him who should have been buried like a prince or like a\r\npauper. It was the crowning buffet, the final victory of Philistia over\r\nart, beauty, and immaterial things.\r\n\r\nLeonard Upjohn had never written anything better. It was a miracle of\r\ncharm, grace, and pity. He printed all Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s best poems in the\r\ncourse of the article, so that when the volume appeared much of its\r\npoint was gone; but he advanced his own position a good deal. He was\r\nthenceforth a critic to be reckoned with. He had seemed before a little\r\naloof; but there was a warm humanity about this article which was\r\ninfinitely attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring Philip, having finished his dressing in the out-patients\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndepartment, became an in-patients\xe2\x80\x99 clerk. This appointment lasted six\r\nmonths. The clerk spent every morning in the wards, first in the men\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthen in the women\xe2\x80\x99s, with the house-physician; he wrote up cases, made\r\ntests, and passed the time of day with the nurses. On two afternoons a\r\nweek the physician in charge went round with a little knot of students,\r\nexamined the cases, and dispensed information. The work had not the\r\nexcitement, the constant change, the intimate contact with reality, of\r\nthe work in the out-patients\xe2\x80\x99 department; but Philip picked up a good\r\ndeal of knowledge. He got on very well with the patients, and he was a\r\nlittle flattered at the pleasure they showed in his attendance on them.\r\nHe was not conscious of any deep sympathy in their sufferings, but he\r\nliked them; and because he put on no airs he was more popular with them\r\nthan others of the clerks. He was pleasant, encouraging, and friendly.\r\nLike everyone connected with hospitals he found that male patients were\r\nmore easy to get on with than female. The women were often querulous\r\nand ill-tempered. They complained bitterly of the hard-worked nurses,\r\nwho did not show them the attention they thought their right; and they\r\nwere troublesome, ungrateful, and rude.\r\n\r\nPresently Philip was fortunate enough to make a friend. One morning the\r\nhouse-physician gave him a new case, a man; and, seating himself at the\r\nbedside, Philip proceeded to write down particulars on the \xe2\x80\x98letter.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nnoticed on looking at this that the patient was described as a\r\njournalist: his name was Thorpe Athelny, an unusual one for a hospital\r\npatient, and his age was forty-eight. He was suffering from a sharp\r\nattack of jaundice, and had been taken into the ward on account of\r\nobscure symptoms which it seemed necessary to watch. He answered the\r\nvarious questions which it was Philip\xe2\x80\x99s duty to ask him in a pleasant,\r\neducated voice. Since he was lying in bed it was difficult to tell if\r\nhe was short or tall, but his small head and small hands suggested that\r\nhe was a man of less than average height. Philip had the habit of\r\nlooking at people\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s astonished him: they were very\r\nsmall, with long, tapering fingers and beautiful, rosy finger-nails;\r\nthey were very smooth and except for the jaundice would have been of a\r\nsurprising whiteness. The patient kept them outside the bed-clothes,\r\none of them slightly spread out, the second and third fingers together,\r\nand, while he spoke to Philip, seemed to contemplate them with\r\nsatisfaction. With a twinkle in his eyes Philip glanced at the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface. Notwithstanding the yellowness it was distinguished; he had blue\r\neyes, a nose of an imposing boldness, hooked, aggressive but not\r\nclumsy, and a small beard, pointed and gray: he was rather bald, but\r\nhis hair had evidently been quite fine, curling prettily, and he still\r\nwore it long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you\xe2\x80\x99re a journalist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat papers d\xe2\x80\x99you write\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write for all the papers. You cannot open a paper without seeing\r\nsome of my writing.\xe2\x80\x9d There was one by the side of the bed and reaching\r\nfor it he pointed out an advertisement. In large letters was the name\r\nof a firm well-known to Philip, Lynn and Sedley, Regent Street, London;\r\nand below, in type smaller but still of some magnitude, was the\r\ndogmatic statement: Procrastination is the Thief of Time. Then a\r\nquestion, startling because of its reasonableness: Why not order today?\r\nThere was a repetition, in large letters, like the hammering of\r\nconscience on a murderer\xe2\x80\x99s heart: Why not? Then, boldly: Thousands of\r\npairs of gloves from the leading markets of the world at astounding\r\nprices. Thousands of pairs of stockings from the most reliable\r\nmanufacturers of the universe at sensational reductions. Finally the\r\nquestion recurred, but flung now like a challenging gauntlet in the\r\nlists: Why not order today?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the press representative of Lynn and Sedley.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave a little\r\nwave of his beautiful hand. \xe2\x80\x9cTo what base uses\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip went on asking the regulation questions, some a mere matter of\r\nroutine, others artfully devised to lead the patient to discover things\r\nwhich he might be expected to desire to conceal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever lived abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in Spain for eleven years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was secretary of the English water company at Toledo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip remembered that Clutton had spent some months in Toledo, and the\r\njournalist\xe2\x80\x99s answer made him look at him with more interest; but he\r\nfelt it would be improper to show this: it was necessary to preserve\r\nthe distance between the hospital patient and the staff. When he had\r\nfinished his examination he went on to other beds.\r\n\r\nThorpe Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s illness was not grave, and, though remaining very\r\nyellow, he soon felt much better: he stayed in bed only because the\r\nphysician thought he should be kept under observation till certain\r\nreactions became normal. One day, on entering the ward, Philip noticed\r\nthat Athelny, pencil in hand, was reading a book. He put it down when\r\nPhilip came to his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re reading?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, who could never pass a\r\nbook without looking at it.\r\n\r\nPhilip took it up and saw that it was a volume of Spanish verse, the\r\npoems of San Juan de la Cruz, and as he opened it a sheet of paper fell\r\nout. Philip picked it up and noticed that verse was written upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ve been occupying your leisure in\r\nwriting poetry? That\xe2\x80\x99s a most improper proceeding in a hospital\r\npatient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to do some translations. D\xe2\x80\x99you know Spanish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know all about San Juan de la Cruz, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was one of the Spanish mystics. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best poets they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\never had. I thought it would be worth while translating him into\r\nEnglish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I look at your translation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very rough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny, but he gave it to Philip with an\r\nalacrity which suggested that he was eager for him to read it.\r\n\r\nIt was written in pencil, in a fine but very peculiar handwriting,\r\nwhich was hard to read: it was just like black letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it take you an awful time to write like that? It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why handwriting shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d Philip read the\r\nfirst verse:\r\n\r\n             In an obscure night\r\n             With anxious love inflamed\r\n             O happy lot!\r\n             Forth unobserved I went,\r\n             My house being now at rest\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\nPhilip looked curiously at Thorpe Athelny. He did not know whether he\r\nfelt a little shy with him or was attracted by him. He was conscious\r\nthat his manner had been slightly patronising, and he flushed as it\r\nstruck him that Athelny might have thought him ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an unusual name you\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, for something to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very old Yorkshire name. Once it took the head of my family a\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s hard riding to make the circuit of his estates, but the mighty\r\nare fallen. Fast women and slow horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was short-sighted and when he spoke looked at you with a peculiar\r\nintensity. He took up his volume of poetry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should read Spanish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a noble tongue. It has not\r\nthe mellifluousness of Italian, Italian is the language of tenors and\r\norgan-grinders, but it has grandeur: it does not ripple like a brook in\r\na garden, but it surges tumultuous like a mighty river in flood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis grandiloquence amused Philip, but he was sensitive to rhetoric; and\r\nhe listened with pleasure while Athelny, with picturesque expressions\r\nand the fire of a real enthusiasm, described to him the rich delight of\r\nreading Don Quixote in the original and the music, romantic, limpid,\r\npassionate, of the enchanting Calderon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must get on with my work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, forgive me, I forgot. I will tell my wife to bring me a photograph\r\nof Toledo, and I will show it you. Come and talk to me when you have\r\nthe chance. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a pleasure it gives me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days, in moments snatched whenever there was\r\nopportunity, Philip\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with the journalist increased.\r\nThorpe Athelny was a good talker. He did not say brilliant things, but\r\nhe talked inspiringly, with an eager vividness which fired the\r\nimagination; Philip, living so much in a world of make-believe, found\r\nhis fancy teeming with new pictures. Athelny had very good manners. He\r\nknew much more than Philip, both of the world and of books; he was a\r\nmuch older man; and the readiness of his conversation gave him a\r\ncertain superiority; but he was in the hospital a recipient of charity,\r\nsubject to strict rules; and he held himself between the two positions\r\nwith ease and humour. Once Philip asked him why he had come to the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my principle is to profit by all the benefits that society\r\nprovides. I take advantage of the age I live in. When I\xe2\x80\x99m ill I get\r\nmyself patched up in a hospital and I have no false shame, and I send\r\nmy children to be educated at the board-school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a capital education they get too, much better than I got at\r\nWinchester. How else do you think I could educate them at all? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nnine. You must come and see them all when I get home again. Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days later Thorpe Athelny was well enough to leave the hospital. He\r\ngave Philip his address, and Philip promised to dine with him at one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock on the following Sunday. Athelny had told him that he lived in\r\na house built by Inigo Jones; he had raved, as he raved over\r\neverything, over the balustrade of old oak; and when he came down to\r\nopen the door for Philip he made him at once admire the elegant carving\r\nof the lintel. It was a shabby house, badly needing a coat of paint,\r\nbut with the dignity of its period, in a little street between Chancery\r\nLane and Holborn, which had once been fashionable but was now little\r\nbetter than a slum: there was a plan to pull it down in order to put up\r\nhandsome offices; meanwhile the rents were small, and Athelny was able\r\nto get the two upper floors at a price which suited his income. Philip\r\nhad not seen him up before and was surprised at his small size; he was\r\nnot more than five feet and five inches high. He was dressed\r\nfantastically in blue linen trousers of the sort worn by working men in\r\nFrance, and a very old brown velvet coat; he wore a bright red sash\r\nround his waist, a low collar, and for tie a flowing bow of the kind\r\nused by the comic Frenchman in the pages of Punch. He greeted Philip\r\nwith enthusiasm. He began talking at once of the house and passed his\r\nhand lovingly over the balusters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at it, feel it, it\xe2\x80\x99s like silk. What a miracle of grace! And in\r\nfive years the house-breaker will sell it for firewood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe insisted on taking Philip into a room on the first floor, where a\r\nman in shirt sleeves, a blousy woman, and three children were having\r\ntheir Sunday dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just brought this gentleman in to show him your ceiling. Did you\r\never see anything so wonderful? How are you, Mrs. Hodgson? This is Mr.\r\nCarey, who looked after me when I was in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cAny friend of Mr. Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s is welcome.\r\nMr. Athelny shows the ceiling to all his friends. And it don\xe2\x80\x99t matter\r\nwhat we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, if we\xe2\x80\x99re in bed or if I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99aving a wash, in \xe2\x80\x99e\r\ncomes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip could see that they looked upon Athelny as a little queer; but\r\nthey liked him none the less and they listened open-mouthed while he\r\ndiscoursed with his impetuous fluency on the beauty of the\r\nseventeenth-century ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a crime to pull this down, eh, Hodgson? You\xe2\x80\x99re an influential\r\ncitizen, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you write to the papers and protest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man in shirt sleeves gave a laugh and said to Philip:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Athelny will \xe2\x80\x99ave his little joke. They do say these \xe2\x80\x99ouses are\r\nthat insanitory, it\xe2\x80\x99s not safe to live in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSanitation be damned, give me art,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got nine\r\nchildren and they thrive on bad drains. No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take\r\nany risk. None of your new-fangled notions for me! When I move from\r\nhere I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make sure the drains are bad before I take anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and a little fair-haired girl opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaddy, mummy says, do stop talking and come and eat your dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my third daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny, pointing to her with a\r\ndramatic forefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is called Maria del Pilar, but she answers\r\nmore willingly to the name of Jane. Jane, your nose wants blowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a hanky, daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut, child,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, as he produced a vast, brilliant\r\nbandanna, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you suppose the Almighty gave you fingers for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs, and Philip was taken into a room with walls\r\npanelled in dark oak. In the middle was a narrow table of teak on\r\ntrestle legs, with two supporting bars of iron, of the kind called in\r\nSpain mesa de hieraje. They were to dine there, for two places were\r\nlaid, and there were two large arm-chairs, with broad flat arms of oak\r\nand leathern backs, and leathern seats. They were severe, elegant, and\r\nuncomfortable. The only other piece of furniture was a bargueno,\r\nelaborately ornamented with gilt iron-work, on a stand of\r\necclesiastical design roughly but very finely carved. There stood on\r\nthis two or three lustre plates, much broken but rich in colour; and on\r\nthe walls were old masters of the Spanish school in beautiful though\r\ndilapidated frames: though gruesome in subject, ruined by age and bad\r\ntreatment, and second-rate in their conception, they had a glow of\r\npassion. There was nothing in the room of any value, but the effect was\r\nlovely. It was magnificent and yet austere. Philip felt that it offered\r\nthe very spirit of old Spain. Athelny was in the middle of showing him\r\nthe inside of the bargueno, with its beautiful ornamentation and secret\r\ndrawers, when a tall girl, with two plaits of bright brown hair hanging\r\ndown her back, came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother says dinner\xe2\x80\x99s ready and waiting and I\xe2\x80\x99m to bring it in as soon\r\nas you sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and shake hands with Mr. Carey, Sally.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to Philip.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she enormous? She\xe2\x80\x99s my eldest. How old are you, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen, father, come next June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI christened her Maria del Sol, because she was my first child and I\r\ndedicated her to the glorious sun of Castile; but her mother calls her\r\nSally and her brother Pudding-Face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled shyly, she had even, white teeth, and blushed. She was\r\nwell set-up, tall for her age, with pleasant gray eyes and a broad\r\nforehead. She had red cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell your mother to come in and shake hands with Mr. Carey\r\nbefore he sits down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother says she\xe2\x80\x99ll come in after dinner. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t washed herself\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll go in and see her ourselves. He mustn\xe2\x80\x99t eat the Yorkshire\r\npudding till he\xe2\x80\x99s shaken the hand that made it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip followed his host into the kitchen. It was small and much\r\novercrowded. There had been a lot of noise, but it stopped as soon as\r\nthe stranger entered. There was a large table in the middle and round\r\nit, eager for dinner, were seated Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s children. A woman was\r\nstanding at the oven, taking out baked potatoes one by one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Carey, Betty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy bringing him in here. What will he think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wore a dirty apron, and the sleeves of her cotton dress were turned\r\nup above her elbows; she had curling pins in her hair. Mrs. Athelny was\r\na large woman, a good three inches taller than her husband, fair, with\r\nblue eyes and a kindly expression; she had been a handsome creature,\r\nbut advancing years and the bearing of many children had made her fat\r\nand blousy; her blue eyes had become pale, her skin was coarse and red,\r\nthe colour had gone out of her hair. She straightened herself, wiped\r\nher hand on her apron, and held it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a slow voice, with an accent that\r\nseemed oddly familiar to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cAthelny said you was very kind to him\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x99orspital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you must be introduced to the live stock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\r\nThorpe,\xe2\x80\x9d he pointed to a chubby boy with curly hair, \xe2\x80\x9che is my eldest\r\nson, heir to the title, estates, and responsibilities of the family.\r\nThere is Athelstan, Harold, Edward.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed with his forefinger to\r\nthree smaller boys, all rosy, healthy, and smiling, though when they\r\nfelt Philip\xe2\x80\x99s smiling eyes upon them they looked shyly down at their\r\nplates. \xe2\x80\x9cNow the girls in order: Maria del Sol\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPudding-Face,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the small boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sense of humour is rudimentary, my son. Maria de los Mercedes,\r\nMaria del Pilar, Maria de la Concepcion, Maria del Rosario.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call them Sally, Molly, Connie, Rosie, and Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Athelny.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Athelny, you go into your own room and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you your dinner.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll let the children come in afterwards for a bit when I\xe2\x80\x99ve washed\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, if I\xe2\x80\x99d had the naming of you I should have called you Maria\r\nof the Soapsuds. You\xe2\x80\x99re always torturing these wretched brats with\r\nsoap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go first, Mr. Carey, or I shall never get him to sit down and eat\r\nhis dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthelny and Philip installed themselves in the great monkish chairs,\r\nand Sally brought them in two plates of beef, Yorkshire pudding, baked\r\npotatoes, and cabbage. Athelny took sixpence out of his pocket and sent\r\nher for a jug of beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the table laid here on my account,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPhilip. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have been quite happy to eat with the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I always have my meals by myself. I like these antique customs.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that women ought to sit down at table with men. It ruins\r\nconversation and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s very bad for them. It puts ideas in\r\ntheir heads, and women are never at ease with themselves when they have\r\nideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth host and guest ate with a hearty appetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever taste such Yorkshire pudding? No one can make it like my\r\nwife. That\xe2\x80\x99s the advantage of not marrying a lady. You noticed she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lady, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an awkward question, and Philip did not know how to answer it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said lamely.\r\n\r\nAthelny laughed. He had a peculiarly joyous laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she\xe2\x80\x99s not a lady, nor anything like it. Her father was a farmer,\r\nand she\xe2\x80\x99s never bothered about aitches in her life. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had twelve\r\nchildren and nine of them are alive. I tell her it\xe2\x80\x99s about time she\r\nstopped, but she\xe2\x80\x99s an obstinate woman, she\xe2\x80\x99s got into the habit of it\r\nnow, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied till she\xe2\x80\x99s had twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment Sally came in with the beer, and, having poured out a\r\nglass for Philip, went to the other side of the table to pour some out\r\nfor her father. He put his hand round her waist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see such a handsome, strapping girl? Only fifteen and she\r\nmight be twenty. Look at her cheeks. She\xe2\x80\x99s never had a day\xe2\x80\x99s illness in\r\nher life. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a lucky man who marries her, won\xe2\x80\x99t it, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally listened to all this with a slight, slow smile, not much\r\nembarrassed, for she was accustomed to her father\xe2\x80\x99s outbursts, but with\r\nan easy modesty which was very attractive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let your dinner get cold, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, drawing herself\r\naway from his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll call when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for your pudding,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were left alone, and Athelny lifted the pewter tankard to his\r\nlips. He drank long and deep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word, is there anything better than English beer?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\nthank God for simple pleasures, roast beef and rice pudding, a good\r\nappetite and beer. I was married to a lady once. My God! Don\xe2\x80\x99t marry a\r\nlady, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed. He was exhilarated by the scene, the funny little man\r\nin his odd clothes, the panelled room and the Spanish furniture, the\r\nEnglish fare: the whole thing had an exquisite incongruity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou laugh, my boy, you can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine marrying beneath you. You want a\r\nwife who\xe2\x80\x99s an intellectual equal. Your head is crammed full of ideas of\r\ncomradeship. Stuff and nonsense, my boy! A man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk\r\npolitics to his wife, and what do you think I care for Betty\xe2\x80\x99s views\r\nupon the Differential Calculus? A man wants a wife who can cook his\r\ndinner and look after his children. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried both and I know. Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhave the pudding in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clapped his hands and presently Sally came. When she took away the\r\nplates, Philip wanted to get up and help her, but Athelny stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her alone, my boy. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to fuss about, do you,\r\nSally? And she won\xe2\x80\x99t think it rude of you to sit still while she waits\r\nupon you. She don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn for chivalry, do you, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sally demurely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father. But you know mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like you to swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthelny laughed boisterously. Sally brought them plates of rice\r\npudding, rich, creamy, and luscious. Athelny attacked his with gusto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the rules of this house is that Sunday dinner should never\r\nalter. It is a ritual. Roast beef and rice pudding for fifty Sundays in\r\nthe year. On Easter Sunday lamb and green peas, and at Michaelmas roast\r\ngoose and apple sauce. Thus we preserve the traditions of our people.\r\nWhen Sally marries she will forget many of the wise things I have\r\ntaught her, but she will never forget that if you want to be good and\r\nhappy you must eat on Sundays roast beef and rice pudding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll call when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for cheese,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally impassively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know the legend of the halcyon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny: Philip was\r\ngrowing used to his rapid leaping from one subject to another. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nthe kingfisher, flying over the sea, is exhausted, his mate places\r\nherself beneath him and bears him along upon her stronger wings. That\r\nis what a man wants in a wife, the halcyon. I lived with my first wife\r\nfor three years. She was a lady, she had fifteen hundred a year, and we\r\nused to give nice little dinner parties in our little red brick house\r\nin Kensington. She was a charming woman; they all said so, the\r\nbarristers and their wives who dined with us, and the literary\r\nstockbrokers, and the budding politicians; oh, she was a charming\r\nwoman. She made me go to church in a silk hat and a frock coat, she\r\ntook me to classical concerts, and she was very fond of lectures on\r\nSunday afternoon; and she sat down to breakfast every morning at\r\neight-thirty, and if I was late breakfast was cold; and she read the\r\nright books, admired the right pictures, and adored the right music. My\r\nGod, how that woman bored me! She is charming still, and she lives in\r\nthe little red brick house in Kensington, with Morris papers and\r\nWhistler\xe2\x80\x99s etchings on the walls, and gives the same nice little dinner\r\nparties, with veal creams and ices from Gunter\xe2\x80\x99s, as she did twenty\r\nyears ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not ask by what means the ill-matched couple had separated,\r\nbut Athelny told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetty\xe2\x80\x99s not my wife, you know; my wife wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t divorce me. The\r\nchildren are bastards, every jack one of them, and are they any the\r\nworse for that? Betty was one of the maids in the little red brick\r\nhouse in Kensington. Four or five years ago I was on my uppers, and I\r\nhad seven children, and I went to my wife and asked her to help me. She\r\nsaid she\xe2\x80\x99d make me an allowance if I\xe2\x80\x99d give Betty up and go abroad. Can\r\nyou see me giving Betty up? We starved for a while instead. My wife\r\nsaid I loved the gutter. I\xe2\x80\x99ve degenerated; I\xe2\x80\x99ve come down in the world;\r\nI earn three pounds a week as press agent to a linendraper, and every\r\nday I thank God that I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the little red brick house in\r\nKensington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally brought in Cheddar cheese, and Athelny went on with his fluent\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest mistake in the world to think that one needs money\r\nto bring up a family. You need money to make them gentlemen and ladies,\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my children to be ladies and gentlemen. Sally\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nto earn her living in another year. She\xe2\x80\x99s to be apprenticed to a\r\ndressmaker, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, Sally? And the boys are going to serve their\r\ncountry. I want them all to go into the Navy; it\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly life and a\r\nhealthy life, good food, good pay, and a pension to end their days on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip lit his pipe. Athelny smoked cigarettes of Havana tobacco, which\r\nhe rolled himself. Sally cleared away. Philip was reserved, and it\r\nembarrassed him to be the recipient of so many confidences. Athelny,\r\nwith his powerful voice in the diminutive body, with his bombast, with\r\nhis foreign look, with his emphasis, was an astonishing creature. He\r\nreminded Philip a good deal of Cronshaw. He appeared to have the same\r\nindependence of thought, the same bohemianism, but he had an infinitely\r\nmore vivacious temperament; his mind was coarser, and he had not that\r\ninterest in the abstract which made Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s conversation so\r\ncaptivating. Athelny was very proud of the county family to which he\r\nbelonged; he showed Philip photographs of an Elizabethan mansion, and\r\ntold him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Athelnys have lived there for seven centuries, my boy. Ah, if you\r\nsaw the chimney-pieces and the ceilings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a cupboard in the wainscoting and from this he took a family\r\ntree. He showed it to Philip with child-like satisfaction. It was\r\nindeed imposing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see how the family names recur, Thorpe, Athelstan, Harold, Edward;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve used the family names for my sons. And the girls, you see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngiven Spanish names to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn uneasy feeling came to Philip that possibly the whole story was an\r\nelaborate imposture, not told with any base motive, but merely from a\r\nwish to impress, startle, and amaze. Athelny had told him that he was\r\nat Winchester; but Philip, sensitive to differences of manner, did not\r\nfeel that his host had the characteristics of a man educated at a great\r\npublic school. While he pointed out the great alliances which his\r\nancestors had formed, Philip amused himself by wondering whether\r\nAthelny was not the son of some tradesman in Winchester, auctioneer or\r\ncoal-merchant, and whether a similarity of surname was not his only\r\nconnection with the ancient family whose tree he was displaying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door and a troop of children came in. They\r\nwere clean and tidy, now. Their faces shone with soap, and their hair\r\nwas plastered down; they were going to Sunday school under Sally\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharge. Athelny joked with them in his dramatic, exuberant fashion, and\r\nyou could see that he was devoted to them all. His pride in their good\r\nhealth and their good looks was touching. Philip felt that they were a\r\nlittle shy in his presence, and when their father sent them off they\r\nfled from the room in evident relief. In a few minutes Mrs. Athelny\r\nappeared. She had taken her hair out of the curling pins and now wore\r\nan elaborate fringe. She had on a plain black dress, a hat with cheap\r\nflowers, and was forcing her hands, red and coarse from much work, into\r\nblack kid gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to church, Athelny,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nwanting, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly your prayers, my Betty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t do you much good, you\xe2\x80\x99re too far gone for that,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsmiled. Then, turning to Philip, she drawled: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t get him to go to\r\nchurch. He\xe2\x80\x99s no better than an atheist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she look like Rubens\xe2\x80\x99 second wife?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe look splendid in a seventeenth-century costume? That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of\r\nwife to marry, my boy. Look at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you\xe2\x80\x99d talk the hind leg off a donkey, Athelny,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\nShe succeeded in buttoning her gloves, but before she went she turned\r\nto Philip with a kindly, slightly embarrassed smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll stay to tea, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Athelny likes someone to talk to, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not often he gets anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s clever enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay to tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny. Then when his wife had\r\ngone: \xe2\x80\x9cI make a point of the children going to Sunday school, and I\r\nlike Betty to go to church. I think women ought to be religious. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe myself, but I like women and children to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, strait-laced in matters of truth, was a little shocked by this\r\nairy attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can you look on while your children are being taught things\r\nwhich you don\xe2\x80\x99t think are true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful I don\xe2\x80\x99t much mind if they\xe2\x80\x99re not true. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nasking a great deal that things should appeal to your reason as well as\r\nto your sense of the aesthetic. I wanted Betty to become a Roman\r\nCatholic, I should have liked to see her converted in a crown of paper\r\nflowers, but she\xe2\x80\x99s hopelessly Protestant. Besides, religion is a matter\r\nof temperament; you will believe anything if you have the religious\r\nturn of mind, and if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what beliefs were\r\ninstilled into you, you will grow out of them. Perhaps religion is the\r\nbest school of morality. It is like one of those drugs you gentlemen\r\nuse in medicine which carries another in solution: it is of no efficacy\r\nin itself, but enables the other to be absorbed. You take your morality\r\nbecause it is combined with religion; you lose the religion and the\r\nmorality stays behind. A man is more likely to be a good man if he has\r\nlearned goodness through the love of God than through a perusal of\r\nHerbert Spencer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was contrary to all Philip\xe2\x80\x99s ideas. He still looked upon\r\nChristianity as a degrading bondage that must be cast away at any cost;\r\nit was connected subconsciously in his mind with the dreary services in\r\nthe cathedral at Tercanbury, and the long hours of boredom in the cold\r\nchurch at Blackstable; and the morality of which Athelny spoke was to\r\nhim no more than a part of the religion which a halting intelligence\r\npreserved, when it had laid aside the beliefs which alone made it\r\nreasonable. But while he was meditating a reply Athelny, more\r\ninterested in hearing himself speak than in discussion, broke into a\r\ntirade upon Roman Catholicism. For him it was an essential part of\r\nSpain; and Spain meant much to him, because he had escaped to it from\r\nthe conventionality which during his married life he had found so\r\nirksome. With large gestures and in the emphatic tone which made what\r\nhe said so striking, Athelny described to Philip the Spanish cathedrals\r\nwith their vast dark spaces, the massive gold of the altar-pieces, and\r\nthe sumptuous iron-work, gilt and faded, the air laden with incense,\r\nthe silence: Philip almost saw the Canons in their short surplices of\r\nlawn, the acolytes in red, passing from the sacristy to the choir; he\r\nalmost heard the monotonous chanting of vespers. The names which\r\nAthelny mentioned, Avila, Tarragona, Saragossa, Segovia, Cordova, were\r\nlike trumpets in his heart. He seemed to see the great gray piles of\r\ngranite set in old Spanish towns amid a landscape tawny, wild, and\r\nwindswept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought I should love to go to Seville,\xe2\x80\x9d he said casually,\r\nwhen Athelny, with one hand dramatically uplifted, paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeville!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t go there. Seville: it brings\r\nto the mind girls dancing with castanets, singing in gardens by the\r\nGuadalquivir, bull-fights, orange-blossom, mantillas, mantones de\r\nManila. It is the Spain of comic opera and Montmartre. Its facile charm\r\ncan offer permanent entertainment only to an intelligence which is\r\nsuperficial. Theophile Gautier got out of Seville all that it has to\r\noffer. We who come after him can only repeat his sensations. He put\r\nlarge fat hands on the obvious and there is nothing but the obvious\r\nthere; and it is all finger-marked and frayed. Murillo is its painter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthelny got up from his chair, walked over to the Spanish cabinet, let\r\ndown the front with its great gilt hinges and gorgeous lock, and\r\ndisplayed a series of little drawers. He took out a bundle of\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know El Greco?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I remember one of the men in Paris was awfully impressed by him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEl Greco was the painter of Toledo. Betty couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the photograph\r\nI wanted to show you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a picture that El Greco painted of the city\r\nhe loved, and it\xe2\x80\x99s truer than any photograph. Come and sit at the\r\ntable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip dragged his chair forward, and Athelny set the photograph before\r\nhim. He looked at it curiously, for a long time, in silence. He\r\nstretched out his hand for other photographs, and Athelny passed them\r\nto him. He had never before seen the work of that enigmatic master; and\r\nat the first glance he was bothered by the arbitrary drawing: the\r\nfigures were extraordinarily elongated; the heads were very small; the\r\nattitudes were extravagant. This was not realism, and yet, and yet even\r\nin the photographs you had the impression of a troubling reality.\r\nAthelny was describing eagerly, with vivid phrases, but Philip only\r\nheard vaguely what he said. He was puzzled. He was curiously moved.\r\nThese pictures seemed to offer some meaning to him, but he did not know\r\nwhat the meaning was. There were portraits of men with large,\r\nmelancholy eyes which seemed to say you knew not what; there were long\r\nmonks in the Franciscan habit or in the Dominican, with distraught\r\nfaces, making gestures whose sense escaped you; there was an Assumption\r\nof the Virgin; there was a Crucifixion in which the painter by some\r\nmagic of feeling had been able to suggest that the flesh of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndead body was not human flesh only but divine; and there was an\r\nAscension in which the Saviour seemed to surge up towards the empyrean\r\nand yet to stand upon the air as steadily as though it were solid\r\nground: the uplifted arms of the Apostles, the sweep of their\r\ndraperies, their ecstatic gestures, gave an impression of exultation\r\nand of holy joy. The background of nearly all was the sky by night, the\r\ndark night of the soul, with wild clouds swept by strange winds of hell\r\nand lit luridly by an uneasy moon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that sky in Toledo over and over again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave an idea that when first El Greco came to the city it was by such a\r\nnight, and it made so vehement an impression upon him that he could\r\nnever get away from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip remembered how Clutton had been affected by this strange master,\r\nwhose work he now saw for the first time. He thought that Clutton was\r\nthe most interesting of all the people he had known in Paris. His\r\nsardonic manner, his hostile aloofness, had made it difficult to know\r\nhim; but it seemed to Philip, looking back, that there had been in him\r\na tragic force, which sought vainly to express itself in painting. He\r\nwas a man of unusual character, mystical after the fashion of a time\r\nthat had no leaning to mysticism, who was impatient with life because\r\nhe found himself unable to say the things which the obscure impulses of\r\nhis heart suggested. His intellect was not fashioned to the uses of the\r\nspirit. It was not surprising that he felt a deep sympathy with the\r\nGreek who had devised a new technique to express the yearnings of his\r\nsoul. Philip looked again at the series of portraits of Spanish\r\ngentlemen, with ruffles and pointed beards, their faces pale against\r\nthe sober black of their clothes and the darkness of the background. El\r\nGreco was the painter of the soul; and these gentlemen, wan and wasted,\r\nnot by exhaustion but by restraint, with their tortured minds, seem to\r\nwalk unaware of the beauty of the world; for their eyes look only in\r\ntheir hearts, and they are dazzled by the glory of the unseen. No\r\npainter has shown more pitilessly that the world is but a place of\r\npassage. The souls of the men he painted speak their strange longings\r\nthrough their eyes: their senses are miraculously acute, not for sounds\r\nand odours and colour, but for the very subtle sensations of the soul.\r\nThe noble walks with the monkish heart within him, and his eyes see\r\nthings which saints in their cells see too, and he is unastounded. His\r\nlips are not lips that smile.\r\n\r\nPhilip, silent still, returned to the photograph of Toledo, which\r\nseemed to him the most arresting picture of them all. He could not take\r\nhis eyes off it. He felt strangely that he was on the threshold of some\r\nnew discovery in life. He was tremulous with a sense of adventure. He\r\nthought for an instant of the love that had consumed him: love seemed\r\nvery trivial beside the excitement which now leaped in his heart. The\r\npicture he looked at was a long one, with houses crowded upon a hill;\r\nin one corner a boy was holding a large map of the town; in another was\r\na classical figure representing the river Tagus; and in the sky was the\r\nVirgin surrounded by angels. It was a landscape alien to all Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotion, for he had lived in circles that worshipped exact realism; and\r\nyet here again, strangely to himself, he felt a reality greater than\r\nany achieved by the masters in whose steps humbly he had sought to\r\nwalk. He heard Athelny say that the representation was so precise that\r\nwhen the citizens of Toledo came to look at the picture they recognised\r\ntheir houses. The painter had painted exactly what he saw but he had\r\nseen with the eyes of the spirit. There was something unearthly in that\r\ncity of pale gray. It was a city of the soul seen by a wan light that\r\nwas neither that of night nor day. It stood on a green hill, but of a\r\ngreen not of this world, and it was surrounded by massive walls and\r\nbastions to be stormed by no machines or engines of man\xe2\x80\x99s invention,\r\nbut by prayer and fasting, by contrite sighs and by mortifications of\r\nthe flesh. It was a stronghold of God. Those gray houses were made of\r\nno stone known to masons, there was something terrifying in their\r\naspect, and you did not know what men might live in them. You might\r\nwalk through the streets and be unamazed to find them all deserted, and\r\nyet not empty; for you felt a presence invisible and yet manifest to\r\nevery inner sense. It was a mystical city in which the imagination\r\nfaltered like one who steps out of the light into darkness; the soul\r\nwalked naked to and fro, knowing the unknowable, and conscious\r\nstrangely of experience, intimate but inexpressible, of the absolute.\r\nAnd without surprise, in that blue sky, real with a reality that not\r\nthe eye but the soul confesses, with its rack of light clouds driven by\r\nstrange breezes, like the cries and the sighs of lost souls, you saw\r\nthe Blessed Virgin with a gown of red and a cloak of blue, surrounded\r\nby winged angels. Philip felt that the inhabitants of that city would\r\nhave seen the apparition without astonishment, reverent and thankful,\r\nand have gone their ways.\r\n\r\nAthelny spoke of the mystical writers of Spain, of Teresa de Avila, San\r\nJuan de la Cruz, Fray Luis de Leon; in all of them was that passion for\r\nthe unseen which Philip felt in the pictures of El Greco: they seemed\r\nto have the power to touch the incorporeal and see the invisible. They\r\nwere Spaniards of their age, in whom were tremulous all the mighty\r\nexploits of a great nation: their fancies were rich with the glories of\r\nAmerica and the green islands of the Caribbean Sea; in their veins was\r\nthe power that had come from age-long battling with the Moor; they were\r\nproud, for they were masters of the world; and they felt in themselves\r\nthe wide distances, the tawny wastes, the snow-capped mountains of\r\nCastile, the sunshine and the blue sky, and the flowering plains of\r\nAndalusia. Life was passionate and manifold, and because it offered so\r\nmuch they felt a restless yearning for something more; because they\r\nwere human they were unsatisfied; and they threw this eager vitality of\r\ntheirs into a vehement striving after the ineffable. Athelny was not\r\ndispleased to find someone to whom he could read the translations with\r\nwhich for some time he had amused his leisure; and in his fine,\r\nvibrating voice he recited the canticle of the Soul and Christ her\r\nlover, the lovely poem which begins with the words en una noche oscura,\r\nand the noche serena of Fray Luis de Leon. He had translated them quite\r\nsimply, not without skill, and he had found words which at all events\r\nsuggested the rough-hewn grandeur of the original. The pictures of El\r\nGreco explained them, and they explained the pictures.\r\n\r\nPhilip had cultivated a certain disdain for idealism. He had always had\r\na passion for life, and the idealism he had come across seemed to him\r\nfor the most part a cowardly shrinking from it. The idealist withdrew\r\nhimself, because he could not suffer the jostling of the human crowd;\r\nhe had not the strength to fight and so called the battle vulgar; he\r\nwas vain, and since his fellows would not take him at his own estimate,\r\nconsoled himself with despising his fellows. For Philip his type was\r\nHayward, fair, languid, too fat now and rather bald, still cherishing\r\nthe remains of his good looks and still delicately proposing to do\r\nexquisite things in the uncertain future; and at the back of this were\r\nwhiskey and vulgar amours of the street. It was in reaction from what\r\nHayward represented that Philip clamoured for life as it stood;\r\nsordidness, vice, deformity, did not offend him; he declared that he\r\nwanted man in his nakedness; and he rubbed his hands when an instance\r\ncame before him of meanness, cruelty, selfishness, or lust: that was\r\nthe real thing. In Paris he had learned that there was neither ugliness\r\nnor beauty, but only truth: the search after beauty was sentimental.\r\nHad he not painted an advertisement of chocolat Menier in a landscape\r\nin order to escape from the tyranny of prettiness?\r\n\r\nBut here he seemed to divine something new. He had been coming to it,\r\nall hesitating, for some time, but only now was conscious of the fact;\r\nhe felt himself on the brink of a discovery. He felt vaguely that here\r\nwas something better than the realism which he had adored; but\r\ncertainly it was not the bloodless idealism which stepped aside from\r\nlife in weakness; it was too strong; it was virile; it accepted life in\r\nall its vivacity, ugliness and beauty, squalor and heroism; it was\r\nrealism still; but it was realism carried to some higher pitch, in\r\nwhich facts were transformed by the more vivid light in which they were\r\nseen. He seemed to see things more profoundly through the grave eyes of\r\nthose dead noblemen of Castile; and the gestures of the saints, which\r\nat first had seemed wild and distorted, appeared to have some\r\nmysterious significance. But he could not tell what that significance\r\nwas. It was like a message which it was very important for him to\r\nreceive, but it was given him in an unknown tongue, and he could not\r\nunderstand. He was always seeking for a meaning in life, and here it\r\nseemed to him that a meaning was offered; but it was obscure and vague.\r\nHe was profoundly troubled. He saw what looked like the truth as by\r\nflashes of lightning on a dark, stormy night you might see a mountain\r\nrange. He seemed to see that a man need not leave his life to chance,\r\nbut that his will was powerful; he seemed to see that self-control\r\nmight be as passionate and as active as the surrender to passion; he\r\nseemed to see that the inward life might be as manifold, as varied, as\r\nrich with experience, as the life of one who conquered realms and\r\nexplored unknown lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conversation between Philip and Athelny was broken into by a\r\nclatter up the stairs. Athelny opened the door for the children coming\r\nback from Sunday school, and with laughter and shouting they came in.\r\nGaily he asked them what they had learned. Sally appeared for a moment,\r\nwith instructions from her mother that father was to amuse the children\r\nwhile she got tea ready; and Athelny began to tell them one of Hans\r\nAndersen\xe2\x80\x99s stories. They were not shy children, and they quickly came\r\nto the conclusion that Philip was not formidable. Jane came and stood\r\nby him and presently settled herself on his knees. It was the first\r\ntime that Philip in his lonely life had been present in a family\r\ncircle: his eyes smiled as they rested on the fair children engrossed\r\nin the fairy tale. The life of his new friend, eccentric as it appeared\r\nat first glance, seemed now to have the beauty of perfect naturalness.\r\nSally came in once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, children, tea\xe2\x80\x99s ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nJane slipped off Philip\xe2\x80\x99s knees, and they all went back to the kitchen.\r\nSally began to lay the cloth on the long Spanish table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother says, shall she come and have tea with you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\ngive the children their tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your mother that we shall be proud and honoured if she will\r\nfavour us with her company,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Philip that he could never say anything without an\r\noratorical flourish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay for her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally.\r\n\r\nShe came back again in a moment with a tray on which were a cottage\r\nloaf, a slab of butter, and a jar of strawberry jam. While she placed\r\nthe things on the table her father chaffed her. He said it was quite\r\ntime she was walking out; he told Philip that she was very proud, and\r\nwould have nothing to do with aspirants to that honour who lined up at\r\nthe door, two by two, outside the Sunday school and craved the honour\r\nof escorting her home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do talk, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally, with her slow, good-natured smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think to look at her that a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s assistant has\r\nenlisted in the army because she would not say how d\xe2\x80\x99you do to him and\r\nan electrical engineer, an electrical engineer, mind you, has taken to\r\ndrink because she refused to share her hymn-book with him in church. I\r\nshudder to think what will happen when she puts her hair up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x99ll bring the tea along herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSally never pays any attention to me,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Athelny, looking at her\r\nwith fond, proud eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cShe goes about her business indifferent to\r\nwars, revolutions, and cataclysms. What a wife she\xe2\x80\x99ll make to an honest\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Athelny brought in the tea. She sat down and proceeded to cut\r\nbread and butter. It amused Philip to see that she treated her husband\r\nas though he were a child. She spread jam for him and cut up the bread\r\nand butter into convenient slices for him to eat. She had taken off her\r\nhat; and in her Sunday dress, which seemed a little tight for her, she\r\nlooked like one of the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives whom Philip used to call on\r\nsometimes with his uncle when he was a small boy. Then he knew why the\r\nsound of her voice was familiar to him. She spoke just like the people\r\nround Blackstable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat part of the country d\xe2\x80\x99you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Kentish woman. I come from Ferne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much. My uncle\xe2\x80\x99s Vicar of Blackstable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a funny thing now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was wondering in Church just\r\nnow whether you was any connection of Mr. Carey. Many\xe2\x80\x99s the time I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen \xe2\x80\x99im. A cousin of mine married Mr. Barker of Roxley Farm, over by\r\nBlackstable Church, and I used to go and stay there often when I was a\r\ngirl. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a funny thing now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a new interest, and a brightness came into her\r\nfaded eyes. She asked him whether he knew Ferne. It was a pretty\r\nvillage about ten miles across country from Blackstable, and the Vicar\r\nhad come over sometimes to Blackstable for the harvest thanksgiving.\r\nShe mentioned names of various farmers in the neighbourhood. She was\r\ndelighted to talk again of the country in which her youth was spent,\r\nand it was a pleasure to her to recall scenes and people that had\r\nremained in her memory with the tenacity peculiar to her class. It gave\r\nPhilip a queer sensation too. A breath of the country-side seemed to be\r\nwafted into that panelled room in the middle of London. He seemed to\r\nsee the fat Kentish fields with their stately elms; and his nostrils\r\ndilated with the scent of the air; it is laden with the salt of the\r\nNorth Sea, and that makes it keen and sharp.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not leave the Athelnys\xe2\x80\x99 till ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The children came\r\nin to say good-night at eight and quite naturally put up their faces\r\nfor Philip to kiss. His heart went out to them. Sally only held out her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSally never kisses gentlemen till she\xe2\x80\x99s seen them twice,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must ask me again then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take any notice of what father says,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Sally, with\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a most self-possessed young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d added her parent.\r\n\r\nThey had supper of bread and cheese and beer, while Mrs. Athelny was\r\nputting the children to bed; and when Philip went into the kitchen to\r\nbid her good-night (she had been sitting there, resting herself and\r\nreading The Weekly Despatch) she invited him cordially to come again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always a good dinner on Sundays so long as Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s in work,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s a charity to come and talk to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday Philip received a postcard from Athelny\r\nsaying that they were expecting him to dinner next day; but fearing\r\ntheir means were not such that Mr. Athelny would desire him to accept,\r\nPhilip wrote back that he would only come to tea. He bought a large\r\nplum cake so that his entertainment should cost nothing. He found the\r\nwhole family glad to see him, and the cake completed his conquest of\r\nthe children. He insisted that they should all have tea together in the\r\nkitchen, and the meal was noisy and hilarious.\r\n\r\nSoon Philip got into the habit of going to Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s every Sunday. He\r\nbecame a great favourite with the children, because he was simple and\r\nunaffected and because it was so plain that he was fond of them. As\r\nsoon as they heard his ring at the door one of them popped a head out\r\nof window to make sure it was he, and then they all rushed downstairs\r\ntumultuously to let him in. They flung themselves into his arms. At tea\r\nthey fought for the privilege of sitting next to him. Soon they began\r\nto call him Uncle Philip.\r\n\r\nAthelny was very communicative, and little by little Philip learned the\r\nvarious stages of his life. He had followed many occupations, and it\r\noccurred to Philip that he managed to make a mess of everything he\r\nattempted. He had been on a tea plantation in Ceylon and a traveller in\r\nAmerica for Italian wines; his secretaryship of the water company in\r\nToledo had lasted longer than any of his employments; he had been a\r\njournalist and for some time had worked as police-court reporter for an\r\nevening paper; he had been sub-editor of a paper in the Midlands and\r\neditor of another on the Riviera. From all his occupations he had\r\ngathered amusing anecdotes, which he told with a keen pleasure in his\r\nown powers of entertainment. He had read a great deal, chiefly\r\ndelighting in books which were unusual; and he poured forth his stores\r\nof abstruse knowledge with child-like enjoyment of the amazement of his\r\nhearers. Three or four years before abject poverty had driven him to\r\ntake the job of press-representative to a large firm of drapers; and\r\nthough he felt the work unworthy his abilities, which he rated highly,\r\nthe firmness of his wife and the needs of his family had made him stick\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXC\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he left the Athelnys\xe2\x80\x99 Philip walked down Chancery Lane and along\r\nthe Strand to get a \xe2\x80\x99bus at the top of Parliament Street. One Sunday,\r\nwhen he had known them about six weeks, he did this as usual, but he\r\nfound the Kennington \xe2\x80\x99bus full. It was June, but it had rained during\r\nthe day and the night was raw and cold. He walked up to Piccadilly\r\nCircus in order to get a seat; the \xe2\x80\x99bus waited at the fountain, and\r\nwhen it arrived there seldom had more than two or three people in it.\r\nThis service ran every quarter of an hour, and he had some time to\r\nwait. He looked idly at the crowd. The public-houses were closing, and\r\nthere were many people about. His mind was busy with the ideas Athelny\r\nhad the charming gift of suggesting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his heart stood still. He saw Mildred. He had not thought of\r\nher for weeks. She was crossing over from the corner of Shaftesbury\r\nAvenue and stopped at the shelter till a string of cabs passed by. She\r\nwas watching her opportunity and had no eyes for anything else. She\r\nwore a large black straw hat with a mass of feathers on it and a black\r\nsilk dress; at that time it was fashionable for women to wear trains;\r\nthe road was clear, and Mildred crossed, her skirt trailing on the\r\nground, and walked down Piccadilly. Philip, his heart beating\r\nexcitedly, followed her. He did not wish to speak to her, but he\r\nwondered where she was going at that hour; he wanted to get a look at\r\nher face. She walked slowly along and turned down Air Street and so got\r\nthrough into Regent Street. She walked up again towards the Circus.\r\nPhilip was puzzled. He could not make out what she was doing. Perhaps\r\nshe was waiting for somebody, and he felt a great curiosity to know who\r\nit was. She overtook a short man in a bowler hat, who was strolling\r\nvery slowly in the same direction as herself; she gave him a sidelong\r\nglance as she passed. She walked a few steps more till she came to Swan\r\nand Edgar\xe2\x80\x99s, then stopped and waited, facing the road. When the man\r\ncame up she smiled. The man stared at her for a moment, turned away his\r\nhead, and sauntered on. Then Philip understood.\r\n\r\nHe was overwhelmed with horror. For a moment he felt such a weakness in\r\nhis legs that he could hardly stand; then he walked after her quickly;\r\nhe touched her on the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMildred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round with a violent start. He thought that she reddened,\r\nbut in the obscurity he could not see very well. For a while they stood\r\nand looked at one another without speaking. At last she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy seeing you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to answer; he was horribly shaken; and the phrases\r\nthat chased one another through his brain seemed incredibly\r\nmelodramatic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awful,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped, almost to himself.\r\n\r\nShe did not say anything more, she turned away from him, and looked\r\ndown at the pavement. He felt that his face was distorted with misery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there anywhere we can go and talk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thought struck him that perhaps she was in urgent need of money and\r\ncould not afford to go away at that hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple of sovereigns on me if you\xe2\x80\x99re hard up,\xe2\x80\x9d he blurted\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean. I was just walking along here on my way\r\nback to my lodgings. I expected to meet one of the girls from where I\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t lie now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThen he saw that she was crying, and he repeated his question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we go and talk somewhere? Can\xe2\x80\x99t I come back to your rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to take gentlemen\r\nin there. If you like I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt certain that she would not keep an appointment. He was not\r\ngoing to let her go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You must take me somewhere now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there is a room I know, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll charge six shillings for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that. Where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him the address, and he called a cab. They drove to a shabby\r\nstreet beyond the British Museum in the neighbourhood of the Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn\r\nRoad, and she stopped the cab at the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t like you to drive up to the door,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThey were the first words either of them had spoken since getting into\r\nthe cab. They walked a few yards and Mildred knocked three times,\r\nsharply, at a door. Philip noticed in the fanlight a cardboard on which\r\nwas an announcement that apartments were to let. The door was opened\r\nquietly, and an elderly, tall woman let them in. She gave Philip a\r\nstare and then spoke to Mildred in an undertone. Mildred led Philip\r\nalong a passage to a room at the back. It was quite dark; she asked him\r\nfor a match, and lit the gas; there was no globe, and the gas flared\r\nshrilly. Philip saw that he was in a dingy little bed-room with a suite\r\nof furniture, painted to look like pine much too large for it; the lace\r\ncurtains were very dirty; the grate was hidden by a large paper fan.\r\nMildred sank on the chair which stood by the side of the chimney-piece.\r\nPhilip sat on the edge of the bed. He felt ashamed. He saw now that\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks were thick with rouge, her eyebrows were blackened;\r\nbut she looked thin and ill, and the red on her cheeks exaggerated the\r\ngreenish pallor of her skin. She stared at the paper fan in a listless\r\nfashion. Philip could not think what to say, and he had a choking in\r\nhis throat as if he were going to cry. He covered his eyes with his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, it is awful,\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to fuss about. I should have thought\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d have been rather pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not answer, and in a moment she broke into a sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think I do it because I like it, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m so awfully sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do me a fat lot of good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Philip found nothing to say. He was desperately afraid of saying\r\nanything which she might take for a reproach or a sneer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the baby?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got her with me in London. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got the money to keep her on\r\nat Brighton, so I had to take her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a room up Highbury way. I\r\ntold them I was on the stage. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long way to have to come down to\r\nthe West End every day, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a rare job to find anyone who\xe2\x80\x99ll let\r\nto ladies at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they take you back at the shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any work to do anywhere. I walked my legs off looking\r\nfor work. I did get a job once, but I was off for a week because I was\r\nqueer, and when I went back they said they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me any more. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t blame them either, can you? Them places, they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to\r\nhave girls that aren\xe2\x80\x99t strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t look very well now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fit to come out tonight, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help myself, I wanted\r\nthe money. I wrote to Emil and told him I was broke, but he never even\r\nanswered the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have written to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to, not after what happened, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to\r\nknow I was in difficulties. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been surprised if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\njust told me I\xe2\x80\x99d only got what I deserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know me very well, do you, even now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he remembered all the anguish he had suffered on her\r\naccount, and he was sick with the recollection of his pain. But it was\r\nno more than recollection. When he looked at her he knew that he no\r\nlonger loved her. He was very sorry for her, but he was glad to be\r\nfree. Watching her gravely, he asked himself why he had been so\r\nbesotted with passion for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman in every sense of the word,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nonly one I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused for a minute and then flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhate asking you, Philip, but can you spare me anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some money on me. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve only got two\r\npounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave her the sovereigns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you back, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had said nothing that he wanted to say. They had talked as if the\r\nwhole thing were natural; and it looked as though she would go now,\r\nback to the horror of her life, and he would be able to do nothing to\r\nprevent it. She had got up to take the money, and they were both\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I keeping you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you want to be getting home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m in no hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to have a chance of sitting down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words, with all they implied, tore his heart, and it was\r\ndreadfully painful to see the weary way in which she sank back into the\r\nchair. The silence lasted so long that Philip in his embarrassment lit\r\na cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very good of you not to have said anything disagreeable to me,\r\nPhilip. I thought you might say I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw that she was crying again. He remembered how she had come to him\r\nwhen Emil Miller had deserted her and how she had wept. The\r\nrecollection of her suffering and of his own humiliation seemed to\r\nrender more overwhelming the compassion he felt now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only get out of it!\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate it so. I\xe2\x80\x99m unfit\r\nfor the life, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the sort of girl for that. I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything to get\r\naway from it, I\xe2\x80\x99d be a servant if I could. Oh, I wish I was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in pity for herself she broke down now completely. She sobbed\r\nhysterically, and her thin body was shaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is. Nobody knows till they\xe2\x80\x99ve done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip could not bear to see her cry. He was tortured by the horror of\r\nher position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was deeply moved. Suddenly he had an inspiration. It filled him with\r\na perfect ecstasy of happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, if you want to get away from it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an idea. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nfrightfully hard up just now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be as economical as I can;\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a sort of little flat now in Kennington and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nspare room. If you like you and the baby can come and live there. I pay\r\na woman three and sixpence a week to keep the place clean and to do a\r\nlittle cooking for me. You could do that and your food wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to\r\nmuch more than the money I should save on her. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cost any more\r\nto feed two than one, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose the baby eats much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped crying and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say that you could take me back after all that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip flushed a little in embarrassment at what he had to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to mistake me. I\xe2\x80\x99m just giving you a room which\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t cost me anything and your food. I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything more\r\nfrom you than that you should do exactly the same as the woman I have\r\nin does. Except for that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything from you at all. I\r\ndaresay you can cook well enough for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet and was about to come towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good to me, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, please stop where you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hurriedly, putting out his\r\nhand as though to push her away.\r\n\r\nHe did not know why it was, but he could not bear the thought that she\r\nshould touch him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be anything more than a friend to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that mean you\xe2\x80\x99ll come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything to get away from this. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never regret\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, Philip, never. When can I come, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better come tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she burst into tears again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth are you crying for now?\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so grateful to you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I can ever make it up to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right. You\xe2\x80\x99d better go home now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote out the address and told her that if she came at half past\r\nfive he would be ready for her. It was so late that he had to walk\r\nhome, but it did not seem a long way, for he was intoxicated with\r\ndelight; he seemed to walk on air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCI\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day he got up early to make the room ready for Mildred. He told\r\nthe woman who had looked after him that he would not want her any more.\r\nMildred came about six, and Philip, who was watching from the window,\r\nwent down to let her in and help her to bring up the luggage: it\r\nconsisted now of no more than three large parcels wrapped in brown\r\npaper, for she had been obliged to sell everything that was not\r\nabsolutely needful. She wore the same black silk dress she had worn the\r\nnight before, and, though she had now no rouge on her cheeks, there was\r\nstill about her eyes the black which remained after a perfunctory wash\r\nin the morning: it made her look very ill. She was a pathetic figure as\r\nshe stepped out of the cab with the baby in her arms. She seemed a\r\nlittle shy, and they found nothing but commonplace things to say to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve got here all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never lived in this part of London before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip showed her the room. It was that in which Cronshaw had died.\r\nPhilip, though he thought it absurd, had never liked the idea of going\r\nback to it; and since Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s death he had remained in the little\r\nroom, sleeping on a fold-up bed, into which he had first moved in order\r\nto make his friend comfortable. The baby was sleeping placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t recognise her, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen her since we took her down to Brighton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall I put her? She\xe2\x80\x99s so heavy I can\xe2\x80\x99t carry her very long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a cradle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, with a nervous laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep with me. She always does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred put the baby in an arm-chair and looked round the room. She\r\nrecognised most of the things which she had known in his old diggings.\r\nOnly one thing was new, a head and shoulders of Philip which Lawson had\r\npainted at the end of the preceding summer; it hung over the\r\nchimney-piece; Mildred looked at it critically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some ways I like it and in some ways I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re better\r\nlooking than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings are looking up,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never told me I was\r\ngood-looking before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not one to worry myself about a man\xe2\x80\x99s looks. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\ngood-looking men. They\xe2\x80\x99re too conceited for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes travelled round the room in an instinctive search for a\r\nlooking-glass, but there was none; she put up her hand and patted her\r\nlarge fringe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll the other people in the house say to my being here?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s only a man and his wife living here. He\xe2\x80\x99s out all day, and\r\nI never see her except on Saturday to pay my rent. They keep entirely\r\nto themselves. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not spoken two words to either of them since I\r\ncame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred went into the bedroom to undo her things and put them away.\r\nPhilip tried to read, but his spirits were too high: he leaned back in\r\nhis chair, smoking a cigarette, and with smiling eyes looked at the\r\nsleeping child. He felt very happy. He was quite sure that he was not\r\nat all in love with Mildred. He was surprised that the old feeling had\r\nleft him so completely; he discerned in himself a faint physical\r\nrepulsion from her; and he thought that if he touched her it would give\r\nhim goose-flesh. He could not understand himself. Presently, knocking\r\nat the door, she came in again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t knock,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you made the tour of the\r\nmansion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the smallest kitchen I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it large enough to cook our sumptuous repasts,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nretorted lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in. I\xe2\x80\x99d better go out and get something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I venture to remind you that we must be devilish economical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I get for supper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better get what you think you can cook,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Philip.\r\n\r\nHe gave her some money and she went out. She came in half an hour later\r\nand put her purchases on the table. She was out of breath from climbing\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you are anaemic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to dose you with\r\nBlaud\xe2\x80\x99s Pills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt took me some time to find the shops. I bought some liver. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntasty, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And you can\xe2\x80\x99t eat much of it, so it\xe2\x80\x99s more economical\r\nthan butcher\xe2\x80\x99s meat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a gas stove in the kitchen, and when she had put the liver\r\non, Mildred came into the sitting-room to lay the cloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you only laying one place?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to\r\neat anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like me to have my meals with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m only a servant, aren\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be an ass. How can you be so silly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled, but her humility gave him a curious twist in his heart. Poor\r\nthing! He remembered what she had been when first he knew her. He\r\nhesitated for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m conferring any benefit on you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s simply\r\na business arrangement, I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you board and lodging in return for\r\nyour work. You don\xe2\x80\x99t owe me anything. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing humiliating\r\nto you in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but tears rolled heavily down her cheeks. Philip\r\nknew from his experience at the hospital that women of her class looked\r\nupon service as degrading: he could not help feeling a little impatient\r\nwith her; but he blamed himself, for it was clear that she was tired\r\nand ill. He got up and helped her to lay another place at the table.\r\nThe baby was awake now, and Mildred had prepared some Mellin\xe2\x80\x99s Food for\r\nit. The liver and bacon were ready and they sat down. For economy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake Philip had given up drinking anything but water, but he had in the\r\nhouse a half a bottle of whiskey, and he thought a little would do\r\nMildred good. He did his best to make the supper pass cheerfully, but\r\nMildred was subdued and exhausted. When they had finished she got up to\r\nput the baby to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99ll do well to turn in early yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nlook absolute done up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I will after I\xe2\x80\x99ve washed up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip lit his pipe and began to read. It was pleasant to hear somebody\r\nmoving about in the next room. Sometimes his loneliness had oppressed\r\nhim. Mildred came in to clear the table, and he heard the clatter of\r\nplates as she washed up. Philip smiled as he thought how characteristic\r\nit was of her that she should do all that in a black silk dress. But he\r\nhad work to do, and he brought his book up to the table. He was reading\r\nOsler\xe2\x80\x99s Medicine, which had recently taken the place in the students\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfavour of Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s work, for many years the text-book most in use.\r\nPresently Mildred came in, rolling down her sleeves. Philip gave her a\r\ncasual glance, but did not move; the occasion was curious, and he felt\r\na little nervous. He feared that Mildred might imagine he was going to\r\nmake a nuisance of himself, and he did not quite know how without\r\nbrutality to reassure her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lecture at nine, so I should want breakfast at\r\na quarter past eight. Can you manage that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. Why, when I was in Parliament Street I used to catch the\r\neight-twelve from Herne Hill every morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll find your room comfortable. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be a different woman\r\ntomorrow after a long night in bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you work till late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI generally work till about eleven or half-past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say good-night then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe table was between them. He did not offer to shake hands with her.\r\nShe shut the door quietly. He heard her moving about in the bed-room,\r\nand in a little while he heard the creaking of the bed as she got in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day was Tuesday. Philip as usual hurried through his\r\nbreakfast and dashed off to get to his lecture at nine. He had only\r\ntime to exchange a few words with Mildred. When he came back in the\r\nevening he found her seated at the window, darning his socks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you are industrious,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing with\r\nyourself all day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I gave the place a good cleaning and then I took baby out for a\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was wearing an old black dress, the same as she had worn as uniform\r\nwhen she served in the tea-shop; it was shabby, but she looked better\r\nin it than in the silk of the day before. The baby was sitting on the\r\nfloor. She looked up at Philip with large, mysterious eyes and broke\r\ninto a laugh when he sat down beside her and began playing with her\r\nbare toes. The afternoon sun came into the room and shed a mellow\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather jolly to come back and find someone about the place. A\r\nwoman and a baby make very good decoration in a room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had gone to the hospital dispensary and got a bottle of Blaud\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPills, He gave them to Mildred and told her she must take them after\r\neach meal. It was a remedy she was used to, for she had taken it off\r\nand on ever since she was sixteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure Lawson would love that green skin of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d say it was so paintable, but I\xe2\x80\x99m terribly matter of fact\r\nnowadays, and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be happy till you\xe2\x80\x99re as pink and white as a\r\nmilkmaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel better already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a frugal supper Philip filled his pouch with tobacco and put on\r\nhis hat. It was on Tuesdays that he generally went to the tavern in\r\nBeak Street, and he was glad that this day came so soon after Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival, for he wanted to make his relations with her perfectly clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going out?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, on Tuesdays I give myself a night off. I shall see you tomorrow.\r\nGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip always went to the tavern with a sense of pleasure. Macalister,\r\nthe philosophic stockbroker, was generally there and glad to argue upon\r\nany subject under the sun; Hayward came regularly when he was in\r\nLondon; and though he and Macalister disliked one another they\r\ncontinued out of habit to meet on that one evening in the week.\r\nMacalister thought Hayward a poor creature, and sneered at his\r\ndelicacies of sentiment: he asked satirically about Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s literary\r\nwork and received with scornful smiles his vague suggestions of future\r\nmasterpieces; their arguments were often heated; but the punch was\r\ngood, and they were both fond of it; towards the end of the evening\r\nthey generally composed their differences and thought each other\r\ncapital fellows. This evening Philip found them both there, and Lawson\r\nalso; Lawson came more seldom now that he was beginning to know people\r\nin London and went out to dinner a good deal. They were all on\r\nexcellent terms with themselves, for Macalister had given them a good\r\nthing on the Stock Exchange, and Hayward and Lawson had made fifty\r\npounds apiece. It was a great thing for Lawson, who was extravagant and\r\nearned little money: he had arrived at that stage of the\r\nportrait-painter\xe2\x80\x99s career when he was noticed a good deal by the\r\ncritics and found a number of aristocratic ladies who were willing to\r\nallow him to paint them for nothing (it advertised them both, and gave\r\nthe great ladies quite an air of patronesses of the arts); but he very\r\nseldom got hold of the solid philistine who was ready to pay good money\r\nfor a portrait of his wife. Lawson was brimming over with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the most ripping way of making money that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever struck,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to put my hand in my pocket for sixpence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lost something by not being here last Tuesday, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMacalister to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you write to me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you only knew\r\nhow useful a hundred pounds would be to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t time for that. One has to be on the spot. I heard of\r\na good thing last Tuesday, and I asked these fellows if they\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\nhave a flutter, I bought them a thousand shares on Wednesday morning,\r\nand there was a rise in the afternoon so I sold them at once. I made\r\nfifty pounds for each of them and a couple of hundred for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was sick with envy. He had recently sold the last mortgage in\r\nwhich his small fortune had been invested and now had only six hundred\r\npounds left. He was panic-stricken sometimes when he thought of the\r\nfuture. He had still to keep himself for two years before he could be\r\nqualified, and then he meant to try for hospital appointments, so that\r\nhe could not expect to earn anything for three years at least. With the\r\nmost rigid economy he would not have more than a hundred pounds left\r\nthen. It was very little to have as a stand-by in case he was ill and\r\ncould not earn money or found himself at any time without work. A lucky\r\ngamble would make all the difference to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macalister. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething is sure to\r\nturn up soon. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be a boom in South Africans again one of these\r\ndays, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMacalister was in the Kaffir market and often told them stories of the\r\nsudden fortunes that had been made in the great boom of a year or two\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat on talking till nearly midnight, and Philip, who lived\r\nfurthest off, was the first to go. If he did not catch the last tram he\r\nhad to walk, and that made him very late. As it was he did not reach\r\nhome till nearly half past twelve. When he got upstairs he was\r\nsurprised to find Mildred still sitting in his arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth aren\xe2\x80\x99t you in bed?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sleepy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to go to bed all the same. It would rest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not move. He noticed that since supper she had changed into her\r\nblack silk dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d rather wait up for you in case you wanted anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n She looked at him, and the shadow of a smile played upon her thin pale\r\n lips. Philip was not sure whether he understood or not. He was\r\n slightly embarrassed, but assumed a cheerful, matter-of-fact air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very naughty also. Run off to bed as\r\nfast as you can, or you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get up tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like going to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said coldly.\r\n\r\nShe got up, a little sulkily, and went into her room. He smiled when he\r\nheard her lock the door loudly.\r\n\r\nThe next few days passed without incident. Mildred settled down in her\r\nnew surroundings. When Philip hurried off after breakfast she had the\r\nwhole morning to do the housework. They ate very simply, but she liked\r\nto take a long time to buy the few things they needed; she could not be\r\nbothered to cook anything for her dinner, but made herself some cocoa\r\nand ate bread and butter; then she took the baby out in the gocart, and\r\nwhen she came in spent the rest of the afternoon in idleness. She was\r\ntired out, and it suited her to do so little. She made friends with\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s forbidding landlady over the rent, which he left with Mildred\r\nto pay, and within a week was able to tell him more about his\r\nneighbours than he had learned in a year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite the lady. I told her we\r\nwas married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think that was necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I had to tell her something. It looks so funny me being here and\r\nnot married to you. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she\xe2\x80\x99d think of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose she believed you for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she did, I lay. I told her we\xe2\x80\x99d been married two years\xe2\x80\x94I had to\r\nsay that, you know, because of baby\xe2\x80\x94only your people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of\r\nit, because you was only a student\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she pronounced it stoodent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand so\r\nwe had to keep it a secret, but they\xe2\x80\x99d given way now and we were all\r\ngoing down to stay with them in the summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a past mistress of the cock-and-bull story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe was vaguely irritated that Mildred still had this passion for\r\ntelling fibs. In the last two years she had learnt nothing. But he\r\nshrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen all\xe2\x80\x99s said and done,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cshe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had much chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful evening, warm and cloudless, and the people of South\r\nLondon seemed to have poured out into the streets. There was that\r\nrestlessness in the air which seizes the cockney sometimes when a turn\r\nin the weather calls him into the open. After Mildred had cleared away\r\nthe supper she went and stood at the window. The street noises came up\r\nto them, noises of people calling to one another, of the passing\r\ntraffic, of a barrel-organ in the distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you must work tonight, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked him, with a\r\nwistful expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I must. Why, d\xe2\x80\x99you want me to do\r\nanything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to go out for a bit. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t we take a ride on the top of a\r\ntram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just go and put on my hat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said joyfully.\r\n\r\nThe night made it almost impossible to stay indoors. The baby was\r\nasleep and could be safely left; Mildred said she had always left it\r\nalone at night when she went out; it never woke. She was in high\r\nspirits when she came back with her hat on. She had taken the\r\nopportunity to put on a little rouge. Philip thought it was excitement\r\nwhich had brought a faint colour to her pale cheeks; he was touched by\r\nher child-like delight, and reproached himself for the austerity with\r\nwhich he had treated her. She laughed when she got out into the air.\r\nThe first tram they saw was going towards Westminster Bridge and they\r\ngot on it. Philip smoked his pipe, and they looked at the crowded\r\nstreet. The shops were open, gaily lit, and people were doing their\r\nshopping for the next day. They passed a music-hall called the\r\nCanterbury and Mildred cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Philip, do let\xe2\x80\x99s go there. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to a music-hall for\r\nmonths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t afford stalls, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I shall be quite happy in the gallery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey got down and walked back a hundred yards till they came to the\r\ndoors. They got capital seats for sixpence each, high up but not in the\r\ngallery, and the night was so fine that there was plenty of room.\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s eyes glistened. She enjoyed herself thoroughly. There was a\r\nsimple-mindedness in her which touched Philip. She was a puzzle to him.\r\nCertain things in her still pleased him, and he thought that there was\r\na lot in her which was very good: she had been badly brought up, and\r\nher life was hard; he had blamed her for much that she could not help;\r\nand it was his own fault if he had asked virtues from her which it was\r\nnot in her power to give. Under different circumstances she might have\r\nbeen a charming girl. She was extraordinarily unfit for the battle of\r\nlife. As he watched her now in profile, her mouth slightly open and\r\nthat delicate flush on her cheeks, he thought she looked strangely\r\nvirginal. He felt an overwhelming compassion for her, and with all his\r\nheart he forgave her for the misery she had caused him. The smoky\r\natmosphere made Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes ache, but when he suggested going she\r\nturned to him with beseeching face and asked him to stay till the end.\r\nHe smiled and consented. She took his hand and held it for the rest of\r\nthe performance. When they streamed out with the audience into the\r\ncrowded street she did not want to go home; they wandered up the\r\nWestminster Bridge Road, looking at the people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not had such a good time as this for months,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart was full, and he was thankful to the fates because he\r\nhad carried out his sudden impulse to take Mildred and her baby into\r\nhis flat. It was very pleasant to see her happy gratitude. At last she\r\ngrew tired and they jumped on a tram to go home; it was late now, and\r\nwhen they got down and turned into their own street there was no one\r\nabout. Mildred slipped her arm through his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just like old times, Phil,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe had never called him Phil before, that was what Griffiths called\r\nhim; and even now it gave him a curious pang. He remembered how much he\r\nhad wanted to die then; his pain had been so great that he had thought\r\nquite seriously of committing suicide. It all seemed very long ago. He\r\nsmiled at his past self. Now he felt nothing for Mildred but infinite\r\npity. They reached the house, and when they got into the sitting-room\r\nPhilip lit the gas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the baby all right?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just go in and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she came back it was to say that it had not stirred since she left\r\nit. It was a wonderful child. Philip held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you want to go to bed already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nearly one. I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to late hours these days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and holding it looked into his eyes with a little\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhil, the other night in that room, when you asked me to come and stay\r\nhere, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean what you thought I meant, when you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant me to be anything to you except just to cook and that sort of\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip, withdrawing his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be such an old silly,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant it quite seriously. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked you to stay here on\r\nany other condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it, but it would spoil it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well, it\xe2\x80\x99s just as you choose. I\xe2\x80\x99m not one to go down on my\r\nhands and knees for that, and chance it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went out, slamming the door behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Mildred was sulky and taciturn. She remained in her room\r\ntill it was time to get the dinner ready. She was a bad cook and could\r\ndo little more than chops and steaks; and she did not know how to use\r\nup odds and ends, so that Philip was obliged to spend more money than\r\nhe had expected. When she served up she sat down opposite Philip, but\r\nwould eat nothing; he remarked on it; she said she had a bad headache\r\nand was not hungry. He was glad that he had somewhere to spend the rest\r\nof the day; the Athelnys were cheerful and friendly. It was a\r\ndelightful and an unexpected thing to realise that everyone in that\r\nhousehold looked forward with pleasure to his visit. Mildred had gone\r\nto bed when he came back, but next day she was still silent. At supper\r\nshe sat with a haughty expression on her face and a little frown\r\nbetween her eyes. It made Philip impatient, but he told himself that he\r\nmust be considerate to her; he was bound to make allowance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very silent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m paid to cook and clean, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was expected to talk as\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought it an ungracious answer, but if they were going to live\r\ntogether he must do all he could to make things go easily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re cross with me about the other night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nIt was an awkward thing to speak about, but apparently it was necessary\r\nto discuss it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me. I should never have asked you to come\r\nand live here if I\xe2\x80\x99d not meant our relations to be merely friendly. I\r\nsuggested it because I thought you wanted a home and you would have a\r\nchance of looking about for something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t think I care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to say. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nungrateful. I realise that you only proposed it for my sake. It\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\na feeling I have, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, it would make the whole thing\r\nugly and horrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are funny,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at him curiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make you\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was not angry with him now, but puzzled; she had no idea what he\r\nmeant: she accepted the situation, she had indeed a vague feeling that\r\nhe was behaving in a very noble fashion and that she ought to admire\r\nit; but also she felt inclined to laugh at him and perhaps even to\r\ndespise him a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a rum customer,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\r\n\r\nLife went smoothly enough with them. Philip spent all day at the\r\nhospital and worked at home in the evening except when he went to the\r\nAthelnys\xe2\x80\x99 or to the tavern in Beak Street. Once the physician for whom\r\nhe clerked asked him to a solemn dinner, and two or three times he went\r\nto parties given by fellow-students. Mildred accepted the monotony of\r\nher life. If she minded that Philip left her sometimes by herself in\r\nthe evening she never mentioned it. Occasionally he took her to a music\r\nhall. He carried out his intention that the only tie between them\r\nshould be the domestic service she did in return for board and lodging.\r\nShe had made up her mind that it was no use trying to get work that\r\nsummer, and with Philip\xe2\x80\x99s approval determined to stay where she was\r\ntill the autumn. She thought it would be easy to get something to do\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned you can stay on here when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a job if\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s convenient. The room\xe2\x80\x99s there, and the woman who did for me before\r\ncan come in to look after the baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grew very much attached to Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s child. He had a naturally\r\naffectionate disposition, which had had little opportunity to display\r\nitself. Mildred was not unkind to the little girl. She looked after her\r\nvery well and once when she had a bad cold proved herself a devoted\r\nnurse; but the child bored her, and she spoke to her sharply when she\r\nbothered; she was fond of her, but had not the maternal passion which\r\nmight have induced her to forget herself. Mildred had no\r\ndemonstrativeness, and she found the manifestations of affection\r\nridiculous. When Philip sat with the baby on his knees, playing with it\r\nand kissing it, she laughed at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make more fuss of her if you was her father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly silly with the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip flushed, for he hated to be laughed at. It was absurd to be so\r\ndevoted to another man\xe2\x80\x99s baby, and he was a little ashamed of the\r\noverflowing of his heart. But the child, feeling Philip\xe2\x80\x99s attachment,\r\nwould put her face against his or nestle in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have any of the\r\ndisagreeable part of it. How would you like being kept awake for an\r\nhour in the middle of the night because her ladyship wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to\r\nsleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip remembered all sorts of things of his childhood which he thought\r\nhe had long forgotten. He took hold of the baby\xe2\x80\x99s toes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis little pig went to market, this little pig stayed at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he came home in the evening and entered the sitting-room his first\r\nglance was for the baby sprawling on the floor, and it gave him a\r\nlittle thrill of delight to hear the child\xe2\x80\x99s crow of pleasure at seeing\r\nhim. Mildred taught her to call him daddy, and when the child did this\r\nfor the first time of her own accord, laughed immoderately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99re that stuck on baby because she\xe2\x80\x99s mine,\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMildred, \xe2\x80\x9cor if you\xe2\x80\x99d be the same with anybody\xe2\x80\x99s baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never known anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s baby, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his second term as in-patients\xe2\x80\x99 clerk a piece of\r\ngood fortune befell Philip. It was the middle of July. He went one\r\nTuesday evening to the tavern in Beak Street and found nobody there but\r\nMacalister. They sat together, chatting about their absent friends, and\r\nafter a while Macalister said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the way, I heard of a rather good thing today, New\r\nKleinfonteins; it\xe2\x80\x99s a gold mine in Rhodesia. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to have a\r\nflutter you might make a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had been waiting anxiously for such an opportunity, but now that\r\nit came he hesitated. He was desperately afraid of losing money. He had\r\nlittle of the gambler\xe2\x80\x99s spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I dare risk it. How much could I lose\r\nif things went wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spoken of it, only you seemed so keen about it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMacalister answered coldly.\r\n\r\nPhilip felt that Macalister looked upon him as rather a donkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully keen on making a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t make money unless you\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to risk money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMacalister began to talk of other things and Philip, while he was\r\nanswering him, kept thinking that if the venture turned out well the\r\nstockbroker would be very facetious at his expense next time they met.\r\nMacalister had a sarcastic tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I will have a flutter if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you two hundred and fifty shares and if I see a\r\nhalf-crown rise I\xe2\x80\x99ll sell them at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip quickly reckoned out how much that would amount to, and his\r\nmouth watered; thirty pounds would be a godsend just then, and he\r\nthought the fates owed him something. He told Mildred what he had done\r\nwhen he saw her at breakfast next morning. She thought him very silly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew anyone who made money on the Stock Exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Emil always said, you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to make money on the\r\nStock Exchange, he said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip bought an evening paper on his way home and turned at once to\r\nthe money columns. He knew nothing about these things and had\r\ndifficulty in finding the stock which Macalister had spoken of. He saw\r\nthey had advanced a quarter. His heart leaped, and then he felt sick\r\nwith apprehension in case Macalister had forgotten or for some reason\r\nhad not bought. Macalister had promised to telegraph. Philip could not\r\nwait to take a tram home. He jumped into a cab. It was an unwonted\r\nextravagance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a telegram for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he burst in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred.\r\n\r\nHis face fell, and in bitter disappointment he sank heavily into a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy them for me after all. Curse him,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nviolently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat cruel luck! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking all day of what I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndo with the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what were you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of thinking about that now? Oh, I wanted the money so\r\nbadly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a laugh and handed him a telegram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only having a joke with you. I opened it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tore it out of her hands. Macalister had bought him two hundred and\r\nfifty shares and sold them at the half-crown profit he had suggested.\r\nThe commission note was to follow next day. For one moment Philip was\r\nfurious with Mildred for her cruel jest, but then he could only think\r\nof his joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes such a difference to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand you a new\r\ndress if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want it badly enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be operated upon at\r\nthe end of July.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, have you got something the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt struck her that an illness she did not know might explain what had\r\nso much puzzled her. He flushed, for he hated to refer to his\r\ndeformity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but they think they can do something to my foot. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t spare\r\nthe time before, but now it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter so much. I shall start my\r\ndressing in October instead of next month. I shall only be in hospital\r\na few weeks and then we can go away to the seaside for the rest of the\r\nsummer. It\xe2\x80\x99ll do us all good, you and the baby and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to Brighton, Philip, I like Brighton, you get such a nice\r\nclass of people there.\xe2\x80\x9d Philip had vaguely thought of some little\r\nfishing village in Cornwall, but as she spoke it occurred to him that\r\nMildred would be bored to death there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind where we go as long as I get the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not know why, but he had suddenly an irresistible longing for\r\nthe sea. He wanted to bathe, and he thought with delight of splashing\r\nabout in the salt water. He was a good swimmer, and nothing exhilarated\r\nhim like a rough sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, it will be jolly,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be like a honeymoon, won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much can I have\r\nfor my new dress, Phil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip asked Mr. Jacobs, the assistant-surgeon for whom he had dressed,\r\nto do the operation. Jacobs accepted with pleasure, since he was\r\ninterested just then in neglected talipes and was getting together\r\nmaterials for a paper. He warned Philip that he could not make his foot\r\nlike the other, but he thought he could do a good deal; and though he\r\nwould always limp he would be able to wear a boot less unsightly than\r\nthat which he had been accustomed to. Philip remembered how he had\r\nprayed to a God who was able to remove mountains for him who had faith,\r\nand he smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a miracle,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re wise to let me try what I can do. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find a\r\nclub-foot rather a handicap in practice. The layman is full of fads,\r\nand he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like his doctor to have anything the matter with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip went into a \xe2\x80\x98small ward\xe2\x80\x99, which was a room on the landing,\r\noutside each ward, reserved for special cases. He remained there a\r\nmonth, for the surgeon would not let him go till he could walk; and,\r\nbearing the operation very well, he had a pleasant enough time. Lawson\r\nand Athelny came to see him, and one day Mrs. Athelny brought two of\r\nher children; students whom he knew looked in now and again to have a\r\nchat; Mildred came twice a week. Everyone was very kind to him, and\r\nPhilip, always surprised when anyone took trouble with him, was touched\r\nand grateful. He enjoyed the relief from care; he need not worry there\r\nabout the future, neither whether his money would last out nor whether\r\nhe would pass his final examinations; and he could read to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontent. He had not been able to read much of late, since Mildred\r\ndisturbed him: she would make an aimless remark when he was trying to\r\nconcentrate his attention, and would not be satisfied unless he\r\nanswered; whenever he was comfortably settled down with a book she\r\nwould want something done and would come to him with a cork she could\r\nnot draw or a hammer to drive in a nail.\r\n\r\nThey settled to go to Brighton in August. Philip wanted to take\r\nlodgings, but Mildred said that she would have to do housekeeping, and\r\nit would only be a holiday for her if they went to a boarding-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to see about the food every day at home, I get that sick of it\r\nI want a thorough change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip agreed, and it happened that Mildred knew of a boarding-house at\r\nKemp Town where they would not be charged more than twenty-five\r\nshillings a week each. She arranged with Philip to write about rooms,\r\nbut when he got back to Kennington he found that she had done nothing.\r\nHe was irritated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought you had so much to do as all that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of everything. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault if I forget, is\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was so anxious to get to the sea that he would not wait to\r\ncommunicate with the mistress of the boarding-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the luggage at the station and go to the house and see if\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got rooms, and if they have we can just send an outside porter\r\nfor our traps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can please yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred stiffly.\r\n\r\nShe did not like being reproached, and, retiring huffily into a haughty\r\nsilence, she sat by listlessly while Philip made the preparations for\r\ntheir departure. The little flat was hot and stuffy under the August\r\nsun, and from the road beat up a malodorous sultriness. As he lay in\r\nhis bed in the small ward with its red, distempered walls he had longed\r\nfor fresh air and the splashing of the sea against his breast. He felt\r\nhe would go mad if he had to spend another night in London. Mildred\r\nrecovered her good temper when she saw the streets of Brighton crowded\r\nwith people making holiday, and they were both in high spirits as they\r\ndrove out to Kemp Town. Philip stroked the baby\xe2\x80\x99s cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall get a very different colour into them when we\xe2\x80\x99ve been down\r\nhere a few days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the boarding-house and dismissed the cab. An untidy\r\nmaid opened the door and, when Philip asked if they had rooms, said she\r\nwould inquire. She fetched her mistress. A middle-aged woman, stout and\r\nbusiness-like, came downstairs, gave them the scrutinising glance of\r\nher profession, and asked what accommodation they required.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo single rooms, and if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got such a thing we\xe2\x80\x99d rather like a\r\ncot in one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got one nice large double room,\r\nand I could let you have a cot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that would do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could give you another room next week. Brighton\xe2\x80\x99s very full just\r\nnow, and people have to take what they can get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were only for a few days, Philip, I think we might be able to\r\nmanage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mildred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think two rooms would be more convenient. Can you recommend any\r\nother place where they take boarders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose they\xe2\x80\x99d have room any more than I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind giving me the address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe house the stout woman suggested was in the next street, and they\r\nwalked towards it. Philip could walk quite well, though he had to lean\r\non a stick, and he was rather weak. Mildred carried the baby. They went\r\nfor a little in silence, and then he saw she was crying. It annoyed\r\nhim, and he took no notice, but she forced his attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLend me a hanky, will you? I can\xe2\x80\x99t get at mine with baby,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in\r\na voice strangled with sobs, turning her head away from him.\r\n\r\nHe gave her his handkerchief, but said nothing. She dried her eyes, and\r\nas he did not speak, went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might be poisonous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t make a scene in the street,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll look so funny insisting on separate rooms like that. What\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthey think of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they knew the circumstances I imagine they\xe2\x80\x99d think us surprisingly\r\nmoral,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give it away that we\xe2\x80\x99re not married?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t you live with me as if we were married then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to humiliate you, but I simply\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. I daresay it\xe2\x80\x99s very silly and unreasonable, but it\xe2\x80\x99s stronger\r\nthan I am. I loved you so much that now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no accounting for that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fat lot you must have loved me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe boarding-house to which they had been directed was kept by a\r\nbustling maiden lady, with shrewd eyes and voluble speech. They could\r\nhave one double room for twenty-five shillings a week each, and five\r\nshillings extra for the baby, or they could have two single rooms for a\r\npound a week more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to charge that much more,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman explained apologetically,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause if I\xe2\x80\x99m pushed to it I can put two beds even in the single\r\nrooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay that won\xe2\x80\x99t ruin us. What do you think, Mildred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Anything\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nPhilip passed off her sulky reply with a laugh, and, the landlady\r\nhaving arranged to send for their luggage, they sat down to rest\r\nthemselves. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s foot was hurting him a little, and he was glad to\r\nput it up on a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my sitting in the same room with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMildred aggressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel, Mildred,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you was so well off you could afford to throw away a\r\npound a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me. I assure you it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we can live\r\ntogether at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you despise me, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Why should I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so unnatural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it? You\xe2\x80\x99re not in love with me, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe? Who d\xe2\x80\x99you take me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not as if you were a very passionate woman, you\xe2\x80\x99re not that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so humiliating,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sulkily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fuss about that if I were you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were about a dozen people in the boarding-house. They ate in a\r\nnarrow, dark room at a long table, at the head of which the landlady\r\nsat and carved. The food was bad. The landlady called it French\r\ncooking, by which she meant that the poor quality of the materials was\r\ndisguised by ill-made sauces: plaice masqueraded as sole and New\r\nZealand mutton as lamb. The kitchen was small and inconvenient, so that\r\neverything was served up lukewarm. The people were dull and\r\npretentious; old ladies with elderly maiden daughters; funny old\r\nbachelors with mincing ways; pale-faced, middle-aged clerks with wives,\r\nwho talked of their married daughters and their sons who were in a very\r\ngood position in the Colonies. At table they discussed Miss Corelli\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlatest novel; some of them liked Lord Leighton better than Mr.\r\nAlma-Tadema, and some of them liked Mr. Alma-Tadema better than Lord\r\nLeighton. Mildred soon told the ladies of her romantic marriage with\r\nPhilip; and he found himself an object of interest because his family,\r\ncounty people in a very good position, had cut him off with a shilling\r\nbecause he married while he was only a stoodent; and Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s father,\r\nwho had a large place down Devonshire way, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything for\r\nthem because she had married Philip. That was why they had come to a\r\nboarding-house and had not a nurse for the baby; but they had to have\r\ntwo rooms because they were both used to a good deal of accommodation\r\nand they didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to be cramped. The other visitors also had\r\nexplanations of their presence: one of the single gentlemen generally\r\nwent to the Metropole for his holiday, but he liked cheerful company\r\nand you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get that at one of those expensive hotels; and the old\r\nlady with the middle-aged daughter was having her beautiful house in\r\nLondon done up and she said to her daughter: \xe2\x80\x9cGwennie, my dear, we must\r\nhave a cheap holiday this year,\xe2\x80\x9d and so they had come there, though of\r\ncourse it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the kind of thing they were used to. Mildred\r\nfound them all very superior, and she hated a lot of common, rough\r\npeople. She liked gentlemen to be gentlemen in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen people are gentlemen and ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI like them to be\r\ngentlemen and ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remark seemed cryptic to Philip, but when he heard her say it two\r\nor three times to different persons, and found that it aroused hearty\r\nagreement, he came to the conclusion that it was only obscure to his\r\nown intelligence. It was the first time that Philip and Mildred had\r\nbeen thrown entirely together. In London he did not see her all day,\r\nand when he came home the household affairs, the baby, the neighbours,\r\ngave them something to talk about till he settled down to work. Now he\r\nspent the whole day with her. After breakfast they went down to the\r\nbeach; the morning went easily enough with a bathe and a stroll along\r\nthe front; the evening, which they spent on the pier, having put the\r\nbaby to bed, was tolerable, for there was music to listen to and a\r\nconstant stream of people to look at; (Philip amused himself by\r\nimagining who they were and weaving little stories about them; he had\r\ngot into the habit of answering Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s remarks with his mouth only\r\nso that his thoughts remained undisturbed;) but the afternoons were\r\nlong and dreary. They sat on the beach. Mildred said they must get all\r\nthe benefit they could out of Doctor Brighton, and he could not read\r\nbecause Mildred made observations frequently about things in general.\r\nIf he paid no attention she complained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave that silly old book alone. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be good for you always\r\nreading. You\xe2\x80\x99ll addle your brain, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rot!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, it\xe2\x80\x99s so unsociable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe discovered that it was difficult to talk to her. She had not even\r\nthe power of attending to what she was herself saying, so that a dog\r\nrunning in front of her or the passing of a man in a loud blazer would\r\ncall forth a remark and then she would forget what she had been\r\nspeaking of. She had a bad memory for names, and it irritated her not\r\nto be able to think of them, so that she would pause in the middle of\r\nsome story to rack her brains. Sometimes she had to give it up, but it\r\noften occurred to her afterwards, and when Philip was talking of\r\nsomething she would interrupt him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCollins, that was it. I knew it would come back to me some time.\r\nCollins, that\xe2\x80\x99s the name I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt exasperated him because it showed that she was not listening to\r\nanything he said, and yet, if he was silent, she reproached him for\r\nsulkiness. Her mind was of an order that could not deal for five\r\nminutes with the abstract, and when Philip gave way to his taste for\r\ngeneralising she very quickly showed that she was bored. Mildred dreamt\r\na great deal, and she had an accurate memory for her dreams, which she\r\nwould relate every day with prolixity.\r\n\r\nOne morning he received a long letter from Thorpe Athelny. He was\r\ntaking his holiday in the theatrical way, in which there was much sound\r\nsense, which characterised him. He had done the same thing for ten\r\nyears. He took his whole family to a hop-field in Kent, not far from\r\nMrs. Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s home, and they spent three weeks hopping. It kept them\r\nin the open air, earned them money, much to Mrs. Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsatisfaction, and renewed their contact with mother earth. It was upon\r\nthis that Athelny laid stress. The sojourn in the fields gave them a\r\nnew strength; it was like a magic ceremony, by which they renewed their\r\nyouth and the power of their limbs and the sweetness of the spirit:\r\nPhilip had heard him say many fantastic, rhetorical, and picturesque\r\nthings on the subject. Now Athelny invited him to come over for a day,\r\nhe had certain meditations on Shakespeare and the musical glasses which\r\nhe desired to impart, and the children were clamouring for a sight of\r\nUncle Philip. Philip read the letter again in the afternoon when he was\r\nsitting with Mildred on the beach. He thought of Mrs. Athelny, cheerful\r\nmother of many children, with her kindly hospitality and her good\r\nhumour; of Sally, grave for her years, with funny little maternal ways\r\nand an air of authority, with her long plait of fair hair and her broad\r\nforehead; and then in a bunch of all the others, merry, boisterous,\r\nhealthy, and handsome. His heart went out to them. There was one\r\nquality which they had that he did not remember to have noticed in\r\npeople before, and that was goodness. It had not occurred to him till\r\nnow, but it was evidently the beauty of their goodness which attracted\r\nhim. In theory he did not believe in it: if morality were no more than\r\na matter of convenience good and evil had no meaning. He did not like\r\nto be illogical, but here was simple goodness, natural and without\r\neffort, and he thought it beautiful. Meditating, he slowly tore the\r\nletter into little pieces; he did not see how he could go without\r\nMildred, and he did not want to go with her.\r\n\r\nIt was very hot, the sky was cloudless, and they had been driven to a\r\nshady corner. The baby was gravely playing with stones on the beach,\r\nand now and then she crawled up to Philip and gave him one to hold,\r\nthen took it away again and placed it carefully down. She was playing a\r\nmysterious and complicated game known only to herself. Mildred was\r\nasleep. She lay with her head thrown back and her mouth slightly open;\r\nher legs were stretched out, and her boots protruded from her\r\npetticoats in a grotesque fashion. His eyes had been resting on her\r\nvaguely, but now he looked at her with peculiar attention. He\r\nremembered how passionately he had loved her, and he wondered why now\r\nhe was entirely indifferent to her. The change in him filled him with\r\ndull pain. It seemed to him that all he had suffered had been sheer\r\nwaste. The touch of her hand had filled him with ecstasy; he had\r\ndesired to enter into her soul so that he could share every thought\r\nwith her and every feeling; he had suffered acutely because, when\r\nsilence had fallen between them, a remark of hers showed how far their\r\nthoughts had travelled apart, and he had rebelled against the\r\nunsurmountable wall which seemed to divide every personality from every\r\nother. He found it strangely tragic that he had loved her so madly and\r\nnow loved her not at all. Sometimes he hated her. She was incapable of\r\nlearning, and the experience of life had taught her nothing. She was as\r\nunmannerly as she had always been. It revolted Philip to hear the\r\ninsolence with which she treated the hard-worked servant at the\r\nboarding-house.\r\n\r\nPresently he considered his own plans. At the end of his fourth year he\r\nwould be able to take his examination in midwifery, and a year more\r\nwould see him qualified. Then he might manage a journey to Spain. He\r\nwanted to see the pictures which he knew only from photographs; he felt\r\ndeeply that El Greco held a secret of peculiar moment to him; and he\r\nfancied that in Toledo he would surely find it out. He did not wish to\r\ndo things grandly, and on a hundred pounds he might live for six months\r\nin Spain: if Macalister put him on to another good thing he could make\r\nthat easily. His heart warmed at the thought of those old beautiful\r\ncities, and the tawny plains of Castile. He was convinced that more\r\nmight be got out of life than offered itself at present, and he thought\r\nthat in Spain he could live with greater intensity: it might be\r\npossible to practise in one of those old cities, there were a good many\r\nforeigners, passing or resident, and he should be able to pick up a\r\nliving. But that would be much later; first he must get one or two\r\nhospital appointments; they gave experience and made it easy to get\r\njobs afterwards. He wished to get a berth as ship\xe2\x80\x99s doctor on one of\r\nthe large tramps that took things leisurely enough for a man to see\r\nsomething of the places at which they stopped. He wanted to go to the\r\nEast; and his fancy was rich with pictures of Bangkok and Shanghai, and\r\nthe ports of Japan: he pictured to himself palm-trees and skies blue\r\nand hot, dark-skinned people, pagodas; the scents of the Orient\r\nintoxicated his nostrils. His heart beat with passionate desire for the\r\nbeauty and the strangeness of the world.\r\n\r\nMildred awoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, you naughty girl,\r\nwhat have you been doing to yourself? Her dress was clean yesterday and\r\njust look at it now, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to London Philip began his dressing in the surgical\r\nwards. He was not so much interested in surgery as in medicine, which,\r\na more empirical science, offered greater scope to the imagination. The\r\nwork was a little harder than the corresponding work on the medical\r\nside. There was a lecture from nine till ten, when he went into the\r\nwards; there wounds had to be dressed, stitches taken out, bandages\r\nrenewed: Philip prided himself a little on his skill in bandaging, and\r\nit amused him to wring a word of approval from a nurse. On certain\r\nafternoons in the week there were operations; and he stood in the well\r\nof the theatre, in a white jacket, ready to hand the operating surgeon\r\nany instrument he wanted or to sponge the blood away so that he could\r\nsee what he was about. When some rare operation was to be performed the\r\ntheatre would fill up, but generally there were not more than half a\r\ndozen students present, and then the proceedings had a cosiness which\r\nPhilip enjoyed. At that time the world at large seemed to have a\r\npassion for appendicitis, and a good many cases came to the operating\r\ntheatre for this complaint: the surgeon for whom Philip dressed was in\r\nfriendly rivalry with a colleague as to which could remove an appendix\r\nin the shortest time and with the smallest incision.\r\n\r\nIn due course Philip was put on accident duty. The dressers took this\r\nin turn; it lasted three days, during which they lived in hospital and\r\nate their meals in the common-room; they had a room on the ground floor\r\nnear the casualty ward, with a bed that shut up during the day into a\r\ncupboard. The dresser on duty had to be at hand day and night to see to\r\nany casualty that came in. You were on the move all the time, and not\r\nmore than an hour or two passed during the night without the clanging\r\nof the bell just above your head which made you leap out of bed\r\ninstinctively. Saturday night was of course the busiest time and the\r\nclosing of the public-houses the busiest hour. Men would be brought in\r\nby the police dead drunk and it would be necessary to administer a\r\nstomach-pump; women, rather the worse for liquor themselves, would come\r\nin with a wound on the head or a bleeding nose which their husbands had\r\ngiven them: some would vow to have the law on him, and others, ashamed,\r\nwould declare that it had been an accident. What the dresser could\r\nmanage himself he did, but if there was anything important he sent for\r\nthe house-surgeon: he did this with care, since the house-surgeon was\r\nnot vastly pleased to be dragged down five flights of stairs for\r\nnothing. The cases ranged from a cut finger to a cut throat. Boys came\r\nin with hands mangled by some machine, men were brought who had been\r\nknocked down by a cab, and children who had broken a limb while\r\nplaying: now and then attempted suicides were carried in by the police:\r\nPhilip saw a ghastly, wild-eyed man with a great gash from ear to ear,\r\nand he was in the ward for weeks afterwards in charge of a constable,\r\nsilent, angry because he was alive, and sullen; he made no secret of\r\nthe fact that he would try again to kill himself as soon as he was\r\nreleased. The wards were crowded, and the house-surgeon was faced with\r\na dilemma when patients were brought in by the police: if they were\r\nsent on to the station and died there disagreeable things were said in\r\nthe papers; and it was very difficult sometimes to tell if a man was\r\ndying or drunk. Philip did not go to bed till he was tired out, so that\r\nhe should not have the bother of getting up again in an hour; and he\r\nsat in the casualty ward talking in the intervals of work with the\r\nnight-nurse. She was a gray-haired woman of masculine appearance, who\r\nhad been night-nurse in the casualty department for twenty years. She\r\nliked the work because she was her own mistress and had no sister to\r\nbother her. Her movements were slow, but she was immensely capable and\r\nshe never failed in an emergency. The dressers, often inexperienced or\r\nnervous, found her a tower of strength. She had seen thousands of them,\r\nand they made no impression upon her: she always called them Mr. Brown;\r\nand when they expostulated and told her their real names, she merely\r\nnodded and went on calling them Mr. Brown. It interested Philip to sit\r\nwith her in the bare room, with its two horse-hair couches and the\r\nflaring gas, and listen to her. She had long ceased to look upon the\r\npeople who came in as human beings; they were drunks, or broken arms,\r\nor cut throats. She took the vice and misery and cruelty of the world\r\nas a matter of course; she found nothing to praise or blame in human\r\nactions: she accepted. She had a certain grim humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember one suicide,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cwho threw himself into\r\nthe Thames. They fished him out and brought him here, and ten days\r\nlater he developed typhoid fever from swallowing Thames water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he did all right. I could never make up my mind if it was suicide\r\nor not\xe2\x80\xa6. They\xe2\x80\x99re a funny lot, suicides. I remember one man who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget any work to do and his wife died, so he pawned his clothes and\r\nbought a revolver; but he made a mess of it, he only shot out an eye\r\nand he got all right. And then, if you please, with an eye gone and a\r\npiece of his face blow away, he came to the conclusion that the world\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a bad place after all, and he lived happily ever\r\nafterwards. Thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve always noticed, people don\xe2\x80\x99t commit suicide for\r\nlove, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a fancy of novelists; they commit\r\nsuicide because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any money. I wonder why that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose money\xe2\x80\x99s more important than love,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Philip.\r\n\r\nMoney was in any case occupying Philip\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts a good deal just\r\nthen. He discovered the little truth there was in the airy saying which\r\nhimself had repeated, that two could live as cheaply as one, and his\r\nexpenses were beginning to worry him. Mildred was not a good manager,\r\nand it cost them as much to live as if they had eaten in restaurants;\r\nthe child needed clothes, and Mildred boots, an umbrella, and other\r\nsmall things which it was impossible for her to do without. When they\r\nreturned from Brighton she had announced her intention of getting a\r\njob, but she took no definite steps, and presently a bad cold laid her\r\nup for a fortnight. When she was well she answered one or two\r\nadvertisements, but nothing came of it: either she arrived too late and\r\nthe vacant place was filled, or the work was more than she felt strong\r\nenough to do. Once she got an offer, but the wages were only fourteen\r\nshillings a week, and she thought she was worth more than that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good letting oneself be put upon,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrespect you if you let yourself go too cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think fourteen shillings is so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip, drily.\r\n\r\nHe could not help thinking how useful it would be towards the expenses\r\nof the household, and Mildred was already beginning to hint that she\r\ndid not get a place because she had not got a decent dress to interview\r\nemployers in. He gave her the dress, and she made one or two more\r\nattempts, but Philip came to the conclusion that they were not serious.\r\nShe did not want to work. The only way he knew to make money was on the\r\nStock Exchange, and he was very anxious to repeat the lucky experiment\r\nof the summer; but war had broken out with the Transvaal and nothing\r\nwas doing in South Africans. Macalister told him that Redvers Buller\r\nwould march into Pretoria in a month and then everything would boom.\r\nThe only thing was to wait patiently. What they wanted was a British\r\nreverse to knock things down a bit, and then it might be worth while\r\nbuying. Philip began reading assiduously the \xe2\x80\x98city chat\xe2\x80\x99 of his\r\nfavourite newspaper. He was worried and irritable. Once or twice he\r\nspoke sharply to Mildred, and since she was neither tactful nor patient\r\nshe answered with temper, and they quarrelled. Philip always expressed\r\nhis regret for what he had said, but Mildred had not a forgiving\r\nnature, and she would sulk for a couple of days. She got on his nerves\r\nin all sorts of ways; by the manner in which she ate, and by the\r\nuntidiness which made her leave articles of clothing about their\r\nsitting-room: Philip was excited by the war and devoured the papers,\r\nmorning and evening; but she took no interest in anything that\r\nhappened. She had made the acquaintance of two or three people who\r\nlived in the street, and one of them had asked if she would like the\r\ncurate to call on her. She wore a wedding-ring and called herself Mrs.\r\nCarey. On Philip\xe2\x80\x99s walls were two or three of the drawings which he had\r\nmade in Paris, nudes, two of women and one of Miguel Ajuria, standing\r\nvery square on his feet, with clenched fists. Philip kept them because\r\nthey were the best things he had done, and they reminded him of happy\r\ndays. Mildred had long looked at them with disfavour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d take those drawings down, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him at\r\nlast. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Foreman, of number thirteen, came in yesterday afternoon,\r\nand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which way to look. I saw her staring at them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re indecent. Disgusting, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I call it, to have drawings\r\nof naked people about. And it isn\xe2\x80\x99t nice for baby either. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeginning to notice things now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be so vulgar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVulgar? Modest, I call it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never said anything, but d\xe2\x80\x99you think I\r\nlike having to look at those naked people all day long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no sense of humour at all, Mildred?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked frigidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what sense of humour\xe2\x80\x99s got to do with it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good\r\nmind to take them down myself. If you want to know what I think about\r\nthem, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know what you think about them, and I forbid you to\r\ntouch them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mildred was cross with him she punished him through the baby. The\r\nlittle girl was as fond of Philip as he was of her, and it was her\r\ngreat pleasure every morning to crawl into his room (she was getting on\r\nfor two now and could walk pretty well), and be taken up into his bed.\r\nWhen Mildred stopped this the poor child would cry bitterly. To\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrances she replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to get into habits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd if then he said anything more she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with you what I do with my child. To hear you talk\r\none would think you was her father. I\xe2\x80\x99m her mother, and I ought to know\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s good for her, oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was exasperated by Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity; but he was so\r\nindifferent to her now that it was only at times she made him angry. He\r\ngrew used to having her about. Christmas came, and with it a couple of\r\ndays holiday for Philip. He brought some holly in and decorated the\r\nflat, and on Christmas Day he gave small presents to Mildred and the\r\nbaby. There were only two of them so they could not have a turkey, but\r\nMildred roasted a chicken and boiled a Christmas pudding which she had\r\nbought at a local grocer\xe2\x80\x99s. They stood themselves a bottle of wine.\r\nWhen they had dined Philip sat in his arm-chair by the fire, smoking\r\nhis pipe; and the unaccustomed wine had made him forget for a while the\r\nanxiety about money which was so constantly with him. He felt happy and\r\ncomfortable. Presently Mildred came in to tell him that the baby wanted\r\nhim to kiss her good-night, and with a smile he went into Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed-room. Then, telling the child to go to sleep, he turned down the\r\ngas and, leaving the door open in case she cried, went back into the\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to sit?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Mildred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sit in your chair. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sit on the floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he sat down she settled herself in front of the fire and leaned\r\nagainst his knees. He could not help remembering that this was how they\r\nhad sat together in her rooms in the Vauxhall Bridge Road, but the\r\npositions had been reversed; it was he who had sat on the floor and\r\nleaned his head against her knee. How passionately he had loved her\r\nthen! Now he felt for her a tenderness he had not known for a long\r\ntime. He seemed still to feel twined round his neck the baby\xe2\x80\x99s soft\r\nlittle arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you comfy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, gave a slight smile, and nodded. They gazed into\r\nthe fire dreamily, without speaking to one another. At last she turned\r\nround and stared at him curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t kissed me once since I came here?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you want me to?\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for me in that way any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re much fonder of baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, and she laid her cheek against his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not angry with me any more?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked presently, with her eyes\r\ncast down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth should I be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never cared for you as I do now. It\xe2\x80\x99s only since I passed through\r\nthe fire that I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt to love you.\xe2\x80\x9d It chilled Philip to hear her\r\nmake use of the sort of phrase she read in the penny novelettes which\r\nshe devoured. Then he wondered whether what she said had any meaning\r\nfor her: perhaps she knew no other way to express her genuine feelings\r\nthan the stilted language of The Family Herald.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so funny our living together like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not reply for quite a long time, and silence fell upon them\r\nagain; but at last he spoke and seemed conscious of no interval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me. One can\xe2\x80\x99t help these things. I remember\r\nthat I thought you wicked and cruel because you did this, that, and the\r\nother; but it was very silly of me. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t love me, and it was\r\nabsurd to blame you for that. I thought I could make you love me, but I\r\nknow now that was impossible. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is that makes\r\nsomeone love you, but whatever it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that matters,\r\nand if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t there you won\xe2\x80\x99t create it by kindness, or generosity,\r\nor anything of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought if you\xe2\x80\x99d loved me really you\xe2\x80\x99d have loved me\r\nstill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought so too. I remember how I used to think that it\r\nwould last for ever, I felt I would rather die than be without you, and\r\nI used to long for the time when you would be faded and wrinkled so\r\nthat nobody cared for you any more and I should have you all to\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, and presently she got up and said she was going to\r\nbed. She gave a timid little smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas Day, Philip, won\xe2\x80\x99t you kiss me good-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a laugh, blushed slightly, and kissed her. She went to her\r\nbed-room and he began to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climax came two or three weeks later. Mildred was driven by\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour to a pitch of strange exasperation. There were many\r\ndifferent emotions in her soul, and she passed from mood to mood with\r\nfacility. She spent a great deal of time alone and brooded over her\r\nposition. She did not put all her feelings into words, she did not even\r\nknow what they were, but certain things stood out in her mind, and she\r\nthought of them over and over again. She had never understood Philip,\r\nnor had very much liked him; but she was pleased to have him about her\r\nbecause she thought he was a gentleman. She was impressed because his\r\nfather had been a doctor and his uncle was a clergyman. She despised\r\nhim a little because she had made such a fool of him, and at the same\r\ntime was never quite comfortable in his presence; she could not let\r\nherself go, and she felt that he was criticising her manners.\r\n\r\nWhen she first came to live in the little rooms in Kennington she was\r\ntired out and ashamed. She was glad to be left alone. It was a comfort\r\nto think that there was no rent to pay; she need not go out in all\r\nweathers, and she could lie quietly in bed if she did not feel well.\r\nShe had hated the life she led. It was horrible to have to be affable\r\nand subservient; and even now when it crossed her mind she cried with\r\npity for herself as she thought of the roughness of men and their\r\nbrutal language. But it crossed her mind very seldom. She was grateful\r\nto Philip for coming to her rescue, and when she remembered how\r\nhonestly he had loved her and how badly she had treated him, she felt a\r\npang of remorse. It was easy to make it up to him. It meant very little\r\nto her. She was surprised when he refused her suggestion, but she\r\nshrugged her shoulders: let him put on airs if he liked, she did not\r\ncare, he would be anxious enough in a little while, and then it would\r\nbe her turn to refuse; if he thought it was any deprivation to her he\r\nwas very much mistaken. She had no doubt of her power over him. He was\r\npeculiar, but she knew him through and through. He had so often\r\nquarrelled with her and sworn he would never see her again, and then in\r\na little while he had come on his knees begging to be forgiven. It gave\r\nher a thrill to think how he had cringed before her. He would have been\r\nglad to lie down on the ground for her to walk on him. She had seen him\r\ncry. She knew exactly how to treat him, pay no attention to him, just\r\npretend you didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice his tempers, leave him severely alone, and in\r\na little while he was sure to grovel. She laughed a little to herself,\r\ngood-humouredly, when she thought how he had come and eaten dirt before\r\nher. She had had her fling now. She knew what men were and did not want\r\nto have anything more to do with them. She was quite ready to settle\r\ndown with Philip. When all was said, he was a gentleman in every sense\r\nof the word, and that was something not to be sneezed at, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nAnyhow she was in no hurry, and she was not going to take the first\r\nstep. She was glad to see how fond he was growing of the baby, though\r\nit tickled her a good deal; it was comic that he should set so much\r\nstore on another man\xe2\x80\x99s child. He was peculiar and no mistake.\r\n\r\nBut one or two things surprised her. She had been used to his\r\nsubservience: he was only too glad to do anything for her in the old\r\ndays, she was accustomed to see him cast down by a cross word and in\r\necstasy at a kind one; he was different now, and she said to herself\r\nthat he had not improved in the last year. It never struck her for a\r\nmoment that there could be any change in his feelings, and she thought\r\nit was only acting when he paid no heed to her bad temper. He wanted to\r\nread sometimes and told her to stop talking: she did not know whether\r\nto flare up or to sulk, and was so puzzled that she did neither. Then\r\ncame the conversation in which he told her that he intended their\r\nrelations to be platonic, and, remembering an incident of their common\r\npast, it occurred to her that he dreaded the possibility of her being\r\npregnant. She took pains to reassure him. It made no difference. She\r\nwas the sort of woman who was unable to realise that a man might not\r\nhave her own obsession with sex; her relations with men had been purely\r\non those lines; and she could not understand that they ever had other\r\ninterests. The thought struck her that Philip was in love with somebody\r\nelse, and she watched him, suspecting nurses at the hospital or people\r\nhe met out; but artful questions led her to the conclusion that there\r\nwas no one dangerous in the Athelny household; and it forced itself\r\nupon her also that Philip, like most medical students, was unconscious\r\nof the sex of the nurses with whom his work threw him in contact. They\r\nwere associated in his mind with a faint odour of iodoform. Philip\r\nreceived no letters, and there was no girl\xe2\x80\x99s photograph among his\r\nbelongings. If he was in love with someone, he was very clever at\r\nhiding it; and he answered all Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s questions with frankness and\r\napparently without suspicion that there was any motive in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99s in love with anybody else,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief, for in that case he was certainly still in love with\r\nher; but it made his behaviour very puzzling. If he was going to treat\r\nher like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat? It was\r\nunnatural. Mildred was not a woman who conceived the possibility of\r\ncompassion, generosity, or kindness. Her only conclusion was that\r\nPhilip was queer. She took it into her head that the reasons for his\r\nconduct were chivalrous; and, her imagination filled with the\r\nextravagances of cheap fiction, she pictured to herself all sorts of\r\nromantic explanations for his delicacy. Her fancy ran riot with bitter\r\nmisunderstandings, purifications by fire, snow-white souls, and death\r\nin the cruel cold of a Christmas night. She made up her mind that when\r\nthey went to Brighton she would put an end to all his nonsense; they\r\nwould be alone there, everyone would think them husband and wife, and\r\nthere would be the pier and the band. When she found that nothing would\r\ninduce Philip to share the same room with her, when he spoke to her\r\nabout it with a tone in his voice she had never heard before, she\r\nsuddenly realised that he did not want her. She was astounded. She\r\nremembered all he had said in the past and how desperately he had loved\r\nher. She felt humiliated and angry, but she had a sort of native\r\ninsolence which carried her through. He needn\xe2\x80\x99t think she was in love\r\nwith him, because she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. She hated him sometimes, and she longed\r\nto humble him; but she found herself singularly powerless; she did not\r\nknow which way to handle him. She began to be a little nervous with\r\nhim. Once or twice she cried. Once or twice she set herself to be\r\nparticularly nice to him; but when she took his arm while they walked\r\nalong the front at night he made some excuse in a while to release\r\nhimself, as though it were unpleasant for him to be touched by her. She\r\ncould not make it out. The only hold she had over him was through the\r\nbaby, of whom he seemed to grow fonder and fonder: she could make him\r\nwhite with anger by giving the child a slap or a push; and the only\r\ntime the old, tender smile came back into his eyes was when she stood\r\nwith the baby in her arms. She noticed it when she was being\r\nphotographed like that by a man on the beach, and afterwards she often\r\nstood in the same way for Philip to look at her.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to London Mildred began looking for the work she had\r\nasserted was so easy to find; she wanted now to be independent of\r\nPhilip; and she thought of the satisfaction with which she would\r\nannounce to him that she was going into rooms and would take the child\r\nwith her. But her heart failed her when she came into closer contact\r\nwith the possibility. She had grown unused to the long hours, she did\r\nnot want to be at the beck and call of a manageress, and her dignity\r\nrevolted at the thought of wearing once more a uniform. She had made\r\nout to such of the neighbours as she knew that they were comfortably\r\noff: it would be a come-down if they heard that she had to go out and\r\nwork. Her natural indolence asserted itself. She did not want to leave\r\nPhilip, and so long as he was willing to provide for her, she did not\r\nsee why she should. There was no money to throw away, but she got her\r\nboard and lodging, and he might get better off. His uncle was an old\r\nman and might die any day, he would come into a little then, and even\r\nas things were, it was better than slaving from morning till night for\r\na few shillings a week. Her efforts relaxed; she kept on reading the\r\nadvertisement columns of the daily paper merely to show that she wanted\r\nto do something if anything that was worth her while presented itself.\r\nBut panic seized her, and she was afraid that Philip would grow tired\r\nof supporting her. She had no hold over him at all now, and she fancied\r\nthat he only allowed her to stay there because he was fond of the baby.\r\nShe brooded over it all, and she thought to herself angrily that she\r\nwould make him pay for all this some day. She could not reconcile\r\nherself to the fact that he no longer cared for her. She would make\r\nhim. She suffered from pique, and sometimes in a curious fashion she\r\ndesired Philip. He was so cold now that it exasperated her. She thought\r\nof him in that way incessantly. She thought that he was treating her\r\nvery badly, and she did not know what she had done to deserve it. She\r\nkept on saying to herself that it was unnatural they should live like\r\nthat. Then she thought that if things were different and she were going\r\nto have a baby, he would be sure to marry her. He was funny, but he was\r\na gentleman in every sense of the word, no one could deny that. At last\r\nit became an obsession with her, and she made up her mind to force a\r\nchange in their relations. He never even kissed her now, and she wanted\r\nhim to: she remembered how ardently he had been used to press her lips.\r\nIt gave her a curious feeling to think of it. She often looked at his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nOne evening, at the beginning of February, Philip told her that he was\r\ndining with Lawson, who was giving a party in his studio to celebrate\r\nhis birthday; and he would not be in till late; Lawson had bought a\r\ncouple of bottles of the punch they favoured from the tavern in Beak\r\nStreet, and they proposed to have a merry evening. Mildred asked if\r\nthere were going to be women there, but Philip told her there were not;\r\nonly men had been invited; and they were just going to sit and talk and\r\nsmoke: Mildred did not think it sounded very amusing; if she were a\r\npainter she would have half a dozen models about. She went to bed, but\r\ncould not sleep, and presently an idea struck her; she got up and fixed\r\nthe catch on the wicket at the landing, so that Philip could not get\r\nin. He came back about one, and she heard him curse when he found that\r\nthe wicket was closed. She got out of bed and opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth did you shut yourself in? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\xe2\x80\x99ve dragged you out\r\nof bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left it open on purpose, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how it came to be shut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry up and get back to bed, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked into the sitting-room and turned up the gas. She followed him\r\nin. She went up to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to warm my feet a bit. They\xe2\x80\x99re like ice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down and began to take off his boots. His eyes were shining and\r\nhis cheeks were flushed. She thought he had been drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been enjoying yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a ripping time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was quite sober, but he had been talking and laughing, and he\r\nwas excited still. An evening of that sort reminded him of the old days\r\nin Paris. He was in high spirits. He took his pipe out of his pocket\r\nand filled it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit sleepy. Lawson was in great form. He talked\r\nsixteen to the dozen from the moment I got there till the moment I\r\nleft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you talk about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows! Of every subject under the sun. You should have seen us\r\nall shouting at the tops of our voices and nobody listening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed with pleasure at the recollection, and Mildred laughed\r\ntoo. She was pretty sure he had drunk more than was good for him. That\r\nwas exactly what she had expected. She knew men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nBefore he could answer she settled herself on his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to bed you\xe2\x80\x99d better go and put on a\r\ndressing-gown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m all right as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d Then putting her arms round his neck, she\r\nplaced her face against his and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so horrid to me,\r\nPhil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to get up, but she would not let him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do love you, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk damned rot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without you. I want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe released himself from her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease get up. You\xe2\x80\x99re making a fool of yourself and you\xe2\x80\x99re making me\r\nfeel a perfect idiot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, Philip. I want to make up for all the harm I did you. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this, it\xe2\x80\x99s not in human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe slipped out of the chair and left her in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, but it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a heart-rending sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why? How can you be so cruel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s because I loved you too much. I wore the passion out.\r\nThe thought of anything of that sort horrifies me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t look at you\r\nnow without thinking of Emil and Griffiths. One can\xe2\x80\x99t help those\r\nthings, I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s just nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seized his hand and covered it with kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nShe sank back into the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t love me, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t anywhere to go. You can stay here as\r\nlong as you like, but it must be on the definite understanding that\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re friends and nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she dropped suddenly the vehemence of passion and gave a soft,\r\ninsinuating laugh. She sidled up to Philip and put her arms round him.\r\nShe made her voice low and wheedling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be such an old silly. I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re nervous. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow nice I can be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her face against his and rubbed his cheek with hers. To Philip\r\nher smile was an abominable leer, and the suggestive glitter of her\r\neyes filled him with horror. He drew back instinctively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nBut she would not let him go. She sought his mouth with her lips. He\r\ntook her hands and tore them roughly apart and pushed her away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou disgust me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe steadied herself with one hand on the chimney-piece. She looked at\r\nhim for an instant, and two red spots suddenly appeared on her cheeks.\r\nShe gave a shrill, angry laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI disgust YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused and drew in her breath sharply. Then she burst into a\r\nfurious torrent of abuse. She shouted at the top of her voice. She\r\ncalled him every foul name she could think of. She used language so\r\nobscene that Philip was astounded; she was always so anxious to be\r\nrefined, so shocked by coarseness, that it had never occurred to him\r\nthat she knew the words she used now. She came up to him and thrust her\r\nface in his. It was distorted with passion, and in her tumultuous\r\nspeech the spittle dribbled over her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never cared for you, not once, I was making a fool of you always,\r\nyou bored me, you bored me stiff, and I hated you, I would never have\r\nlet you touch me only for the money, and it used to make me sick when I\r\nhad to let you kiss me. We laughed at you, Griffiths and me, we laughed\r\nbecause you was such a mug. A mug! A mug!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she burst again into abominable invective. She accused him of\r\nevery mean fault; she said he was stingy, she said he was dull, she\r\nsaid he was vain, selfish; she cast virulent ridicule on everything\r\nupon which he was most sensitive. And at last she turned to go. She\r\nkept on, with hysterical violence, shouting at him an opprobrious,\r\nfilthy epithet. She seized the handle of the door and flung it open.\r\nThen she turned round and hurled at him the injury which she knew was\r\nthe only one that really touched him. She threw into the word all the\r\nmalice and all the venom of which she was capable. She flung it at him\r\nas though it were a blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCripple!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip awoke with a start next morning, conscious that it was late, and\r\nlooking at his watch found it was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He jumped out of bed\r\nand went into the kitchen to get himself some hot water to shave with.\r\nThere was no sign of Mildred, and the things which she had used for her\r\nsupper the night before still lay in the sink unwashed. He knocked at\r\nher door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake up, Mildred. It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, even after a second louder knocking, and he\r\nconcluded that she was sulking. He was in too great a hurry to bother\r\nabout that. He put some water on to boil and jumped into his bath which\r\nwas always poured out the night before in order to take the chill off.\r\nHe presumed that Mildred would cook his breakfast while he was dressing\r\nand leave it in the sitting-room. She had done that two or three times\r\nwhen she was out of temper. But he heard no sound of her moving, and\r\nrealised that if he wanted anything to eat he would have to get it\r\nhimself. He was irritated that she should play him such a trick on a\r\nmorning when he had over-slept himself. There was still no sign of her\r\nwhen he was ready, but he heard her moving about her room. She was\r\nevidently getting up. He made himself some tea and cut himself a couple\r\nof pieces of bread and butter, which he ate while he was putting on his\r\nboots, then bolted downstairs and along the street into the main road\r\nto catch his tram. While his eyes sought out the newspaper shops to see\r\nthe war news on the placards, he thought of the scene of the night\r\nbefore: now that it was over and he had slept on it, he could not help\r\nthinking it grotesque; he supposed he had been ridiculous, but he was\r\nnot master of his feelings; at the time they had been overwhelming. He\r\nwas angry with Mildred because she had forced him into that absurd\r\nposition, and then with renewed astonishment he thought of her outburst\r\nand the filthy language she had used. He could not help flushing when\r\nhe remembered her final jibe; but he shrugged his shoulders\r\ncontemptuously. He had long known that when his fellows were angry with\r\nhim they never failed to taunt him with his deformity. He had seen men\r\nat the hospital imitate his walk, not before him as they used at\r\nschool, but when they thought he was not looking. He knew now that they\r\ndid it from no wilful unkindness, but because man is naturally an\r\nimitative animal, and because it was an easy way to make people laugh:\r\nhe knew it, but he could never resign himself to it.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to throw himself into his work. The ward seemed pleasant\r\nand friendly when he entered it. The sister greeted him with a quick,\r\nbusiness-like smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very late, Mr. Carey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was out on the loose last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaughing, he went to the first of his cases, a boy with tuberculous\r\nulcers, and removed his bandages. The boy was pleased to see him, and\r\nPhilip chaffed him as he put a clean dressing on the wound. Philip was\r\na favourite with the patients; he treated them good-humouredly; and he\r\nhad gentle, sensitive hands which did not hurt them: some of the\r\ndressers were a little rough and happy-go-lucky in their methods. He\r\nlunched with his friends in the club-room, a frugal meal consisting of\r\na scone and butter, with a cup of cocoa, and they talked of the war.\r\nSeveral men were going out, but the authorities were particular and\r\nrefused everyone who had not had a hospital appointment. Someone\r\nsuggested that, if the war went on, in a while they would be glad to\r\ntake anyone who was qualified; but the general opinion was that it\r\nwould be over in a month. Now that Roberts was there things would get\r\nall right in no time. This was Macalister\xe2\x80\x99s opinion too, and he had\r\ntold Philip that they must watch their chance and buy just before peace\r\nwas declared. There would be a boom then, and they might all make a bit\r\nof money. Philip had left with Macalister instructions to buy him stock\r\nwhenever the opportunity presented itself. His appetite had been\r\nwhetted by the thirty pounds he had made in the summer, and he wanted\r\nnow to make a couple of hundred.\r\n\r\nHe finished his day\xe2\x80\x99s work and got on a tram to go back to Kennington.\r\nHe wondered how Mildred would behave that evening. It was a nuisance to\r\nthink that she would probably be surly and refuse to answer his\r\nquestions. It was a warm evening for the time of year, and even in\r\nthose gray streets of South London there was the languor of February;\r\nnature is restless then after the long winter months, growing things\r\nawake from their sleep, and there is a rustle in the earth, a\r\nforerunner of spring, as it resumes its eternal activities. Philip\r\nwould have liked to drive on further, it was distasteful to him to go\r\nback to his rooms, and he wanted the air; but the desire to see the\r\nchild clutched suddenly at his heartstrings, and he smiled to himself\r\nas he thought of her toddling towards him with a crow of delight. He\r\nwas surprised, when he reached the house and looked up mechanically at\r\nthe windows, to see that there was no light. He went upstairs and\r\nknocked, but got no answer. When Mildred went out she left the key\r\nunder the mat and he found it there now. He let himself in and going\r\ninto the sitting-room struck a match. Something had happened, he did\r\nnot at once know what; he turned the gas on full and lit it; the room\r\nwas suddenly filled with the glare and he looked round. He gasped. The\r\nwhole place was wrecked. Everything in it had been wilfully destroyed.\r\nAnger seized him, and he rushed into Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s room. It was dark and\r\nempty. When he had got a light he saw that she had taken away all her\r\nthings and the baby\xe2\x80\x99s (he had noticed on entering that the go-cart was\r\nnot in its usual place on the landing, but thought Mildred had taken\r\nthe baby out;) and all the things on the washing-stand had been broken,\r\na knife had been drawn cross-ways through the seats of the two chairs,\r\nthe pillow had been slit open, there were large gashes in the sheets\r\nand the counterpane, the looking-glass appeared to have been broken\r\nwith a hammer. Philip was bewildered. He went into his own room, and\r\nhere too everything was in confusion. The basin and the ewer had been\r\nsmashed, the looking-glass was in fragments, and the sheets were in\r\nribands. Mildred had made a slit large enough to put her hand into the\r\npillow and had scattered the feathers about the room. She had jabbed a\r\nknife into the blankets. On the dressing-table were photographs of\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s mother, the frames had been smashed and the glass shivered.\r\nPhilip went into the tiny kitchen. Everything that was breakable was\r\nbroken, glasses, pudding-basins, plates, dishes.\r\n\r\nIt took Philip\xe2\x80\x99s breath away. Mildred had left no letter, nothing but\r\nthis ruin to mark her anger, and he could imagine the set face with\r\nwhich she had gone about her work. He went back into the sitting-room\r\nand looked about him. He was so astonished that he no longer felt\r\nangry. He looked curiously at the kitchen-knife and the coal-hammer,\r\nwhich were lying on the table where she had left them. Then his eye\r\ncaught a large carving-knife in the fireplace which had been broken. It\r\nmust have taken her a long time to do so much damage. Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s portrait\r\nof him had been cut cross-ways and gaped hideously. His own drawings\r\nhad been ripped in pieces; and the photographs, Manet\xe2\x80\x99s Olympia and the\r\nOdalisque of Ingres, the portrait of Philip IV, had been smashed with\r\ngreat blows of the coal-hammer. There were gashes in the table-cloth\r\nand in the curtains and in the two arm-chairs. They were quite ruined.\r\nOn one wall over the table which Philip used as his desk was the little\r\nbit of Persian rug which Cronshaw had given him. Mildred had always\r\nhated it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s a rug it ought to go on the floor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndirty stinking bit of stuff, that\xe2\x80\x99s all it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made her furious because Philip told her it contained the answer to\r\na great riddle. She thought he was making fun of her. She had drawn the\r\nknife right through it three times, it must have required some\r\nstrength, and it hung now in tatters. Philip had two or three blue and\r\nwhite plates, of no value, but he had bought them one by one for very\r\nsmall sums and liked them for their associations. They littered the\r\nfloor in fragments. There were long gashes on the backs of his books,\r\nand she had taken the trouble to tear pages out of the unbound French\r\nones. The little ornaments on the chimney-piece lay on the hearth in\r\nbits. Everything that it had been possible to destroy with a knife or a\r\nhammer was destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s belongings would not have sold for thirty pounds,\r\nbut most of them were old friends, and he was a domestic creature,\r\nattached to all those odds and ends because they were his; he had been\r\nproud of his little home, and on so little money had made it pretty and\r\ncharacteristic. He sank down now in despair. He asked himself how she\r\ncould have been so cruel. A sudden fear got him on his feet again and\r\ninto the passage, where stood a cupboard in which he kept his clothes.\r\nHe opened it and gave a sigh of relief. She had apparently forgotten it\r\nand none of his things was touched.\r\n\r\nHe went back into the sitting-room and, surveying the scene, wondered\r\nwhat to do; he had not the heart to begin trying to set things\r\nstraight; besides there was no food in the house, and he was hungry. He\r\nwent out and got himself something to eat. When he came in he was\r\ncooler. A little pang seized him as he thought of the child, and he\r\nwondered whether she would miss him, at first perhaps, but in a week\r\nshe would have forgotten him; and he was thankful to be rid of Mildred.\r\nHe did not think of her with wrath, but with an overwhelming sense of\r\nboredom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to God I never see her again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud.\r\n\r\nThe only thing now was to leave the rooms, and he made up his mind to\r\ngive notice the next morning. He could not afford to make good the\r\ndamage done, and he had so little money left that he must find cheaper\r\nlodgings still. He would be glad to get out of them. The expense had\r\nworried him, and now the recollection of Mildred would be in them\r\nalways. Philip was impatient and could never rest till he had put in\r\naction the plan which he had in mind; so on the following afternoon he\r\ngot in a dealer in second-hand furniture who offered him three pounds\r\nfor all his goods damaged and undamaged; and two days later he moved\r\ninto the house opposite the hospital in which he had had rooms when\r\nfirst he became a medical student. The landlady was a very decent\r\nwoman. He took a bed-room at the top, which she let him have for six\r\nshillings a week; it was small and shabby and looked on the yard of the\r\nhouse that backed on to it, but he had nothing now except his clothes\r\nand a box of books, and he was glad to lodge so cheaply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now it happened that the fortunes of Philip Carey, of no\r\nconsequence to any but himself, were affected by the events through\r\nwhich his country was passing. History was being made, and the process\r\nwas so significant that it seemed absurd it should touch the life of an\r\nobscure medical student. Battle after battle, Magersfontein, Colenso,\r\nSpion Kop, lost on the playing fields of Eton, had humiliated the\r\nnation and dealt the death-blow to the prestige of the aristocracy and\r\ngentry who till then had found no one seriously to oppose their\r\nassertion that they possessed a natural instinct of government. The old\r\norder was being swept away: history was being made indeed. Then the\r\ncolossus put forth his strength, and, blundering again, at last\r\nblundered into the semblance of victory. Cronje surrendered at\r\nPaardeberg, Ladysmith was relieved, and at the beginning of March Lord\r\nRoberts marched into Bloemfontein.\r\n\r\nIt was two or three days after the news of this reached London that\r\nMacalister came into the tavern in Beak Street and announced joyfully\r\nthat things were looking brighter on the Stock Exchange. Peace was in\r\nsight, Roberts would march into Pretoria within a few weeks, and shares\r\nwere going up already. There was bound to be a boom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x99s the time to come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good waiting till\r\nthe public gets on to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s now or never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had inside information. The manager of a mine in South Africa had\r\ncabled to the senior partner of his firm that the plant was uninjured.\r\nThey would start working again as soon as possible. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nspeculation, it was an investment. To show how good a thing the senior\r\npartner thought it Macalister told Philip that he had bought five\r\nhundred shares for both his sisters: he never put them into anything\r\nthat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as safe as the Bank of England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to put my shirt on it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe shares were two and an eighth to a quarter. He advised Philip not\r\nto be greedy, but to be satisfied with a ten-shilling rise. He was\r\nbuying three hundred for himself and suggested that Philip should do\r\nthe same. He would hold them and sell when he thought fit. Philip had\r\ngreat faith in him, partly because he was a Scotsman and therefore by\r\nnature cautious, and partly because he had been right before. He jumped\r\nat the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay we shall be able to sell before the account,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMacalister, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if not, I\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange to carry them over for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed a capital system to Philip. You held on till you got your\r\nprofit, and you never even had to put your hand in your pocket. He\r\nbegan to watch the Stock Exchange columns of the paper with new\r\ninterest. Next day everything was up a little, and Macalister wrote to\r\nsay that he had had to pay two and a quarter for the shares. He said\r\nthat the market was firm. But in a day or two there was a set-back. The\r\nnews that came from South Africa was less reassuring, and Philip with\r\nanxiety saw that his shares had fallen to two; but Macalister was\r\noptimistic, the Boers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold out much longer, and he was willing\r\nto bet a top-hat that Roberts would march into Johannesburg before the\r\nmiddle of April. At the account Philip had to pay out nearly forty\r\npounds. It worried him considerably, but he felt that the only course\r\nwas to hold on: in his circumstances the loss was too great for him to\r\npocket. For two or three weeks nothing happened; the Boers would not\r\nunderstand that they were beaten and nothing remained for them but to\r\nsurrender: in fact they had one or two small successes, and Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshares fell half a crown more. It became evident that the war was not\r\nfinished. There was a lot of selling. When Macalister saw Philip he was\r\npessimistic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if the best thing wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be to cut the loss. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\npaying out about as much as I want to in differences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was sick with anxiety. He could not sleep at night; he bolted\r\nhis breakfast, reduced now to tea and bread and butter, in order to get\r\nover to the club reading-room and see the paper; sometimes the news was\r\nbad, and sometimes there was no news at all, but when the shares moved\r\nit was to go down. He did not know what to do. If he sold now he would\r\nlose altogether hard on three hundred and fifty pounds; and that would\r\nleave him only eighty pounds to go on with. He wished with all his\r\nheart that he had never been such a fool as to dabble on the Stock\r\nExchange, but the only thing was to hold on; something decisive might\r\nhappen any day and the shares would go up; he did not hope now for a\r\nprofit, but he wanted to make good his loss. It was his only chance of\r\nfinishing his course at the hospital. The Summer session was beginning\r\nin May, and at the end of it he meant to take the examination in\r\nmidwifery. Then he would only have a year more; he reckoned it out\r\ncarefully and came to the conclusion that he could manage it, fees and\r\nall, on a hundred and fifty pounds; but that was the least it could\r\npossibly be done on.\r\n\r\nEarly in April he went to the tavern in Beak Street anxious to see\r\nMacalister. It eased him a little to discuss the situation with him;\r\nand to realise that numerous people beside himself were suffering from\r\nloss of money made his own trouble a little less intolerable. But when\r\nPhilip arrived no one was there but Hayward, and no sooner had Philip\r\nseated himself than he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sailing for the Cape on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Philip.\r\n\r\nHayward was the last person he would have expected to do anything of\r\nthe kind. At the hospital men were going out now in numbers; the\r\nGovernment was glad to get anyone who was qualified; and others, going\r\nout as troopers, wrote home that they had been put on hospital work as\r\nsoon as it was learned that they were medical students. A wave of\r\npatriotic feeling had swept over the country, and volunteers were\r\ncoming from all ranks of society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going as?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in the Dorset Yeomanry. I\xe2\x80\x99m going as a trooper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had known Hayward for eight years. The youthful intimacy which\r\nhad come from Philip\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic admiration for the man who could\r\ntell him of art and literature had long since vanished; but habit had\r\ntaken its place; and when Hayward was in London they saw one another\r\nonce or twice a week. He still talked about books with a delicate\r\nappreciation. Philip was not yet tolerant, and sometimes Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconversation irritated him. He no longer believed implicitly that\r\nnothing in the world was of consequence but art. He resented Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontempt for action and success. Philip, stirring his punch, thought of\r\nhis early friendship and his ardent expectation that Hayward would do\r\ngreat things; it was long since he had lost all such illusions, and he\r\nknew now that Hayward would never do anything but talk. He found his\r\nthree hundred a year more difficult to live on now that he was\r\nthirty-five than he had when he was a young man; and his clothes,\r\nthough still made by a good tailor, were worn a good deal longer than\r\nat one time he would have thought possible. He was too stout and no\r\nartful arrangement of his fair hair could conceal the fact that he was\r\nbald. His blue eyes were dull and pale. It was not hard to guess that\r\nhe drank too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth made you think of going out to the Cape?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I thought I ought to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent. He felt rather silly. He understood that Hayward was\r\nbeing driven by an uneasiness in his soul which he could not account\r\nfor. Some power within him made it seem necessary to go and fight for\r\nhis country. It was strange, since he considered patriotism no more\r\nthan a prejudice, and, flattering himself on his cosmopolitanism, he\r\nhad looked upon England as a place of exile. His countrymen in the mass\r\nwounded his susceptibilities. Philip wondered what it was that made\r\npeople do things which were so contrary to all their theories of life.\r\nIt would have been reasonable for Hayward to stand aside and watch with\r\na smile while the barbarians slaughtered one another. It looked as\r\nthough men were puppets in the hands of an unknown force, which drove\r\nthem to do this and that; and sometimes they used their reason to\r\njustify their actions; and when this was impossible they did the\r\nactions in despite of reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are very extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI should never have\r\nexpected you to go out as a trooper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHayward smiled, slightly embarrassed, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was examined yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked at last. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was worth while\r\nundergoing the gene of it to know that one was perfectly fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip noticed that he still used a French word in an affected way when\r\nan English one would have served. But just then Macalister came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see you, Carey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy people don\xe2\x80\x99t feel inclined\r\nto hold those shares any more, the market\xe2\x80\x99s in such an awful state, and\r\nthey want you to take them up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank. He knew that was impossible. It meant that he must\r\naccept the loss. His pride made him answer calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I think that\xe2\x80\x99s worth while. You\xe2\x80\x99d better sell them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine to say that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if I can. The market\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstagnant, there are no buyers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re marked down at one and an eighth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get that for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not say anything for a moment. He was trying to collect\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say they\xe2\x80\x99re worth nothing at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. Of course they\xe2\x80\x99re worth something, but you see,\r\nnobody\xe2\x80\x99s buying them now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must just sell them for what you can get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMacalister looked at Philip narrowly. He wondered whether he was very\r\nhard hit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, old man, but we\xe2\x80\x99re all in the same boat. No one\r\nthought the war was going to hang on this way. I put you into them, but\r\nI was in myself too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cOne has to take one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved back to the table from which he had got up to talk to\r\nMacalister. He was dumfounded; his head suddenly began to ache\r\nfuriously; but he did not want them to think him unmanly. He sat on for\r\nan hour. He laughed feverishly at everything they said. At last he got\r\nup to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take it pretty coolly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macalister, shaking hands with him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose anyone likes losing between three and four hundred\r\npounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Philip got back to his shabby little room he flung himself on his\r\nbed, and gave himself over to his despair. He kept on regretting his\r\nfolly bitterly; and though he told himself that it was absurd to regret\r\nfor what had happened was inevitable just because it had happened, he\r\ncould not help himself. He was utterly miserable. He could not sleep.\r\nHe remembered all the ways he had wasted money during the last few\r\nyears. His head ached dreadfully.\r\n\r\nThe following evening there came by the last post the statement of his\r\naccount. He examined his pass-book. He found that when he had paid\r\neverything he would have seven pounds left. Seven pounds! He was\r\nthankful he had been able to pay. It would have been horrible to be\r\nobliged to confess to Macalister that he had not the money. He was\r\ndressing in the eye-department during the summer session, and he had\r\nbought an ophthalmoscope off a student who had one to sell. He had not\r\npaid for this, but he lacked the courage to tell the student that he\r\nwanted to go back on his bargain. Also he had to buy certain books. He\r\nhad about five pounds to go on with. It lasted him six weeks; then he\r\nwrote to his uncle a letter which he thought very business-like; he\r\nsaid that owing to the war he had had grave losses and could not go on\r\nwith his studies unless his uncle came to his help. He suggested that\r\nthe Vicar should lend him a hundred and fifty pounds paid over the next\r\neighteen months in monthly instalments; he would pay interest on this\r\nand promised to refund the capital by degrees when he began to earn\r\nmoney. He would be qualified in a year and a half at the latest, and he\r\ncould be pretty sure then of getting an assistantship at three pounds a\r\nweek. His uncle wrote back that he could do nothing. It was not fair to\r\nask him to sell out when everything was at its worst, and the little he\r\nhad he felt that his duty to himself made it necessary for him to keep\r\nin case of illness. He ended the letter with a little homily. He had\r\nwarned Philip time after time, and Philip had never paid any attention\r\nto him; he could not honestly say he was surprised; he had long\r\nexpected that this would be the end of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s extravagance and want\r\nof balance. Philip grew hot and cold when he read this. It had never\r\noccurred to him that his uncle would refuse, and he burst into furious\r\nanger; but this was succeeded by utter blankness: if his uncle would\r\nnot help him he could not go on at the hospital. Panic seized him and,\r\nputting aside his pride, he wrote again to the Vicar of Blackstable,\r\nplacing the case before him more urgently; but perhaps he did not\r\nexplain himself properly and his uncle did not realise in what\r\ndesperate straits he was, for he answered that he could not change his\r\nmind; Philip was twenty-five and really ought to be earning his living.\r\nWhen he died Philip would come into a little, but till then he refused\r\nto give him a penny. Philip felt in the letter the satisfaction of a\r\nman who for many years had disapproved of his courses and now saw\r\nhimself justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIX\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip began to pawn his clothes. He reduced his expenses by eating\r\nonly one meal a day beside his breakfast; and he ate it, bread and\r\nbutter and cocoa, at four so that it should last him till next morning.\r\nHe was so hungry by nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock that he had to go to bed. He thought\r\nof borrowing money from Lawson, but the fear of a refusal held him\r\nback; at last he asked him for five pounds. Lawson lent it with\r\npleasure, but, as he did so, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll let me have it back in a week or so, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pay\r\nmy framer, and I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully broke just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip knew he would not be able to return it, and the thought of what\r\nLawson would think made him so ashamed that in a couple of days he took\r\nthe money back untouched. Lawson was just going out to luncheon and\r\nasked Philip to come too. Philip could hardly eat, he was so glad to\r\nget some solid food. On Sunday he was sure of a good dinner from\r\nAthelny. He hesitated to tell the Athelnys what had happened to him:\r\nthey had always looked upon him as comparatively well-to-do, and he had\r\na dread that they would think less well of him if they knew he was\r\npenniless.\r\n\r\nThough he had always been poor, the possibility of not having enough to\r\neat had never occurred to him; it was not the sort of thing that\r\nhappened to the people among whom he lived; and he was as ashamed as if\r\nhe had some disgraceful disease. The situation in which he found\r\nhimself was quite outside the range of his experience. He was so taken\r\naback that he did not know what else to do than to go on at the\r\nhospital; he had a vague hope that something would turn up; he could\r\nnot quite believe that what was happening to him was true; and he\r\nremembered how during his first term at school he had often thought his\r\nlife was a dream from which he would awake to find himself once more at\r\nhome. But very soon he foresaw that in a week or so he would have no\r\nmoney at all. He must set about trying to earn something at once. If he\r\nhad been qualified, even with a club-foot, he could have gone out to\r\nthe Cape, since the demand for medical men was now great. Except for\r\nhis deformity he might have enlisted in one of the yeomanry regiments\r\nwhich were constantly being sent out. He went to the secretary of the\r\nMedical School and asked if he could give him the coaching of some\r\nbackward student; but the secretary held out no hope of getting him\r\nanything of the sort. Philip read the advertisement columns of the\r\nmedical papers, and he applied for the post of unqualified assistant to\r\na man who had a dispensary in the Fulham Road. When he went to see him,\r\nhe saw the doctor glance at his club-foot; and on hearing that Philip\r\nwas only in his fourth year at the hospital he said at once that his\r\nexperience was insufficient: Philip understood that this was only an\r\nexcuse; the man would not have an assistant who might not be as active\r\nas he wanted. Philip turned his attention to other means of earning\r\nmoney. He knew French and German and thought there might be some chance\r\nof finding a job as correspondence clerk; it made his heart sink, but\r\nhe set his teeth; there was nothing else to do. Though too shy to\r\nanswer the advertisements which demanded a personal application, he\r\nreplied to those which asked for letters; but he had no experience to\r\nstate and no recommendations: he was conscious that neither his German\r\nnor his French was commercial; he was ignorant of the terms used in\r\nbusiness; he knew neither shorthand nor typewriting. He could not help\r\nrecognising that his case was hopeless. He thought of writing to the\r\nsolicitor who had been his father\xe2\x80\x99s executor, but he could not bring\r\nhimself to, for it was contrary to his express advice that he had sold\r\nthe mortgages in which his money had been invested. He knew from his\r\nuncle that Mr. Nixon thoroughly disapproved of him. He had gathered\r\nfrom Philip\xe2\x80\x99s year in the accountant\xe2\x80\x99s office that he was idle and\r\nincompetent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner starve,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip muttered to himself.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the possibility of suicide presented itself to him; it\r\nwould be easy to get something from the hospital dispensary, and it was\r\na comfort to think that if the worst came to the worst he had at hand\r\nmeans of making a painless end of himself; but it was not a course that\r\nhe considered seriously. When Mildred had left him to go with Griffiths\r\nhis anguish had been so great that he wanted to die in order to get rid\r\nof the pain. He did not feel like that now. He remembered that the\r\nCasualty Sister had told him how people oftener did away with\r\nthemselves for want of money than for want of love; and he chuckled\r\nwhen he thought that he was an exception. He wished only that he could\r\ntalk his worries over with somebody, but he could not bring himself to\r\nconfess them. He was ashamed. He went on looking for work. He left his\r\nrent unpaid for three weeks, explaining to his landlady that he would\r\nget money at the end of the month; she did not say anything, but pursed\r\nher lips and looked grim. When the end of the month came and she asked\r\nif it would be convenient for him to pay something on account, it made\r\nhim feel very sick to say that he could not; he told her he would write\r\nto his uncle and was sure to be able to settle his bill on the\r\nfollowing Saturday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I \xe2\x80\x99ope you will, Mr. Carey, because I \xe2\x80\x99ave my rent to pay, and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t afford to let accounts run on.\xe2\x80\x9d She did not speak with anger, but\r\nwith determination that was rather frightening. She paused for a moment\r\nand then said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t pay next Saturday, I shall \xe2\x80\x99ave to\r\ncomplain to the secretary of the \xe2\x80\x99ospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a little and glanced round the bare room. When\r\nshe spoke it was without any emphasis, as though it were quite a\r\nnatural thing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a nice \xe2\x80\x99ot joint downstairs, and if you like to come down to\r\nthe kitchen you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to a bit of dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt himself redden to the soles of his feet, and a sob caught\r\nat his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, Mrs. Higgins, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not at all hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she left the room Philip threw himself on his bed. He had to\r\nclench his fists in order to prevent himself from crying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday. It was the day on which he had promised to pay his landlady.\r\nHe had been expecting something to turn up all through the week. He had\r\nfound no work. He had never been driven to extremities before, and he\r\nwas so dazed that he did not know what to do. He had at the back of his\r\nmind a feeling that the whole thing was a preposterous joke. He had no\r\nmore than a few coppers left, he had sold all the clothes he could do\r\nwithout; he had some books and one or two odds and ends upon which he\r\nmight have got a shilling or two, but the landlady was keeping an eye\r\non his comings and goings: he was afraid she would stop him if he took\r\nanything more from his room. The only thing was to tell her that he\r\ncould not pay his bill. He had not the courage. It was the middle of\r\nJune. The night was fine and warm. He made up his mind to stay out. He\r\nwalked slowly along the Chelsea Embankment, because the river was\r\nrestful and quiet, till he was tired, and then sat on a bench and\r\ndozed. He did not know how long he slept; he awoke with a start,\r\ndreaming that he was being shaken by a policeman and told to move on;\r\nbut when he opened his eyes he found himself alone. He walked on, he\r\ndid not know why, and at last came to Chiswick, where he slept again.\r\nPresently the hardness of the bench roused him. The night seemed very\r\nlong. He shivered. He was seized with a sense of his misery; and he did\r\nnot know what on earth to do: he was ashamed at having slept on the\r\nEmbankment; it seemed peculiarly humiliating, and he felt his cheeks\r\nflush in the darkness. He remembered stories he had heard of those who\r\ndid and how among them were officers, clergymen, and men who had been\r\nto universities: he wondered if he would become one of them, standing\r\nin a line to get soup from a charitable institution. It would be much\r\nbetter to commit suicide. He could not go on like that: Lawson would\r\nhelp him when he knew what straits he was in; it was absurd to let his\r\npride prevent him from asking for assistance. He wondered why he had\r\ncome such a cropper. He had always tried to do what he thought best,\r\nand everything had gone wrong. He had helped people when he could, he\r\ndid not think he had been more selfish than anyone else, it seemed\r\nhorribly unjust that he should be reduced to such a pass.\r\n\r\nBut it was no good thinking about it. He walked on. It was now light:\r\nthe river was beautiful in the silence, and there was something\r\nmysterious in the early day; it was going to be very fine, and the sky,\r\npale in the dawn, was cloudless. He felt very tired, and hunger was\r\ngnawing at his entrails, but he could not sit still; he was constantly\r\nafraid of being spoken to by a policeman. He dreaded the mortification\r\nof that. He felt dirty and wished he could have a wash. At last he\r\nfound himself at Hampton Court. He felt that if he did not have\r\nsomething to eat he would cry. He chose a cheap eating-house and went\r\nin; there was a smell of hot things, and it made him feel slightly\r\nsick: he meant to eat something nourishing enough to keep up for the\r\nrest of the day, but his stomach revolted at the sight of food. He had\r\na cup of tea and some bread and butter. He remembered then that it was\r\nSunday and he could go to the Athelnys; he thought of the roast beef\r\nand the Yorkshire pudding they would eat; but he was fearfully tired\r\nand could not face the happy, noisy family. He was feeling morose and\r\nwretched. He wanted to be left alone. He made up his mind that he would\r\ngo into the gardens of the palace and lie down. His bones ached.\r\nPerhaps he would find a pump so that he could wash his hands and face\r\nand drink something; he was very thirsty; and now that he was no longer\r\nhungry he thought with pleasure of the flowers and the lawns and the\r\ngreat leafy trees. He felt that there he could think out better what he\r\nmust do. He lay on the grass, in the shade, and lit his pipe. For\r\neconomy\xe2\x80\x99s sake he had for a long time confined himself to two pipes a\r\nday; he was thankful now that his pouch was full. He did not know what\r\npeople did when they had no money. Presently he fell asleep. When he\r\nawoke it was nearly mid-day, and he thought that soon he must be\r\nsetting out for London so as to be there in the early morning and\r\nanswer any advertisements which seemed to promise. He thought of his\r\nuncle, who had told him that he would leave him at his death the little\r\nhe had; Philip did not in the least know how much this was: it could\r\nnot be more than a few hundred pounds. He wondered whether he could\r\nraise money on the reversion. Not without the old man\xe2\x80\x99s consent, and\r\nthat he would never give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing I can do is to hang on somehow till he dies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reckoned his age. The Vicar of Blackstable was well over\r\nseventy. He had chronic bronchitis, but many old men had that and lived\r\non indefinitely. Meanwhile something must turn up; Philip could not get\r\naway from the feeling that his position was altogether abnormal; people\r\nin his particular station did not starve. It was because he could not\r\nbring himself to believe in the reality of his experience that he did\r\nnot give way to utter despair. He made up his mind to borrow half a\r\nsovereign from Lawson. He stayed in the garden all day and smoked when\r\nhe felt very hungry; he did not mean to eat anything until he was\r\nsetting out again for London: it was a long way and he must keep up his\r\nstrength for that. He started when the day began to grow cooler, and\r\nslept on benches when he was tired. No one disturbed him. He had a wash\r\nand brush up, and a shave at Victoria, some tea and bread and butter,\r\nand while he was eating this read the advertisement columns of the\r\nmorning paper. As he looked down them his eye fell upon an announcement\r\nasking for a salesman in the \xe2\x80\x98furnishing drapery\xe2\x80\x99 department of some\r\nwell-known stores. He had a curious little sinking of the heart, for\r\nwith his middle-class prejudices it seemed dreadful to go into a shop;\r\nbut he shrugged his shoulders, after all what did it matter? and he\r\nmade up his mind to have a shot at it. He had a queer feeling that by\r\naccepting every humiliation, by going out to meet it even, he was\r\nforcing the hand of fate. When he presented himself, feeling horribly\r\nshy, in the department at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock he found that many others were\r\nthere before him. They were of all ages, from boys of sixteen to men of\r\nforty; some were talking to one another in undertones, but most were\r\nsilent; and when he took up his place those around him gave him a look\r\nof hostility. He heard one man say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing I look forward to is getting my refusal soon enough to\r\ngive me time to look elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man, standing next him, glanced at Philip and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad any experience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment and then made a remark: \xe2\x80\x9cEven the smaller houses\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t see you without appointment after lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at the assistants. Some were draping chintzes and\r\ncretonnes, and others, his neighbour told him were preparing country\r\norders that had come in by post. At about a quarter past nine the buyer\r\narrived. He heard one of the men who were waiting say to another that\r\nit was Mr. Gibbons. He was middle-aged, short and corpulent, with a\r\nblack beard and dark, greasy hair. He had brisk movements and a clever\r\nface. He wore a silk hat and a frock coat, the lapel of which was\r\nadorned with a white geranium surrounded by leaves. He went into his\r\noffice, leaving the door open; it was very small and contained only an\r\nAmerican roll-desk in the corner, a bookcase, and a cupboard. The men\r\nstanding outside watched him mechanically take the geranium out of his\r\ncoat and put it in an ink-pot filled with water. It was against the\r\nrules to wear flowers in business.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the department men who wanted to keep in with the\r\ngovernor admired the flower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen better,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I did,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled, and a gleam of pride filled his intelligent\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat and changed his coat, glanced at the letters and\r\nthen at the men who were waiting to see him. He made a slight sign with\r\none finger, and the first in the queue stepped into the office. They\r\nfiled past him one by one and answered his questions. He put them very\r\nbriefly, keeping his eyes fixed on the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAge? Experience? Why did you leave your job?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe listened to the replies without expression. When it came to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nturn he fancied that Mr. Gibbons stared at him curiously. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes were neat and tolerably cut. He looked a little different from\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExperience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip walked out of the office. The ordeal had been so much less\r\npainful than he expected that he felt no particular disappointment. He\r\ncould hardly hope to succeed in getting a place the first time he\r\ntried. He had kept the newspaper and now looked at the advertisements\r\nagain: a shop in Holborn needed a salesman too, and he went there; but\r\nwhen he arrived he found that someone had already been engaged. If he\r\nwanted to get anything to eat that day he must go to Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s studio\r\nbefore he went out to luncheon, so he made his way along the Brompton\r\nRoad to Yeoman\xe2\x80\x99s Row.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m rather broke till the end of the month,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as soon as\r\nhe found an opportunity. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d lend me half a sovereign, will\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was incredible the difficulty he found in asking for money; and he\r\nremembered the casual way, as though almost they were conferring a\r\nfavour, men at the hospital had extracted small sums out of him which\r\nthey had no intention of repaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a shot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawson.\r\n\r\nBut when he put his hand in his pocket he found that he had only eight\r\nshillings. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well, lend me five bob, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip went to the public baths in Westminster and spent sixpence on a\r\nbath. Then he got himself something to eat. He did not know what to do\r\nwith himself in the afternoon. He would not go back to the hospital in\r\ncase anyone should ask him questions, and besides, he had nothing to do\r\nthere now; they would wonder in the two or three departments he had\r\nworked in why he did not come, but they must think what they chose, it\r\ndid not matter: he would not be the first student who had dropped out\r\nwithout warning. He went to the free library, and looked at the papers\r\ntill they wearied him, then he took out Stevenson\xe2\x80\x99s New Arabian Nights;\r\nbut he found he could not read: the words meant nothing to him, and he\r\ncontinued to brood over his helplessness. He kept on thinking the same\r\nthings all the time, and the fixity of his thoughts made his head ache.\r\nAt last, craving for fresh air, he went into the Green Park and lay\r\ndown on the grass. He thought miserably of his deformity, which made it\r\nimpossible for him to go to the war. He went to sleep and dreamt that\r\nhe was suddenly sound of foot and out at the Cape in a regiment of\r\nYeomanry; the pictures he had looked at in the illustrated papers gave\r\nmaterials for his fancy; and he saw himself on the Veldt, in khaki,\r\nsitting with other men round a fire at night. When he awoke he found\r\nthat it was still quite light, and presently he heard Big Ben strike\r\nseven. He had twelve hours to get through with nothing to do. He\r\ndreaded the interminable night. The sky was overcast and he feared it\r\nwould rain; he would have to go to a lodging-house where he could get a\r\nbed; he had seen them advertised on lamps outside houses in Lambeth:\r\nGood Beds sixpence; he had never been inside one, and dreaded the foul\r\nsmell and the vermin. He made up his mind to stay in the open air if he\r\npossibly could. He remained in the park till it was closed and then\r\nbegan to walk about. He was very tired. The thought came to him that an\r\naccident would be a piece of luck, so that he could be taken to a\r\nhospital and lie there, in a clean bed, for weeks. At midnight he was\r\nso hungry that he could not go without food any more, so he went to a\r\ncoffee stall at Hyde Park Corner and ate a couple of potatoes and had a\r\ncup of coffee. Then he walked again. He felt too restless to sleep, and\r\nhe had a horrible dread of being moved on by the police. He noted that\r\nhe was beginning to look upon the constable from quite a new angle.\r\nThis was the third night he had spent out. Now and then he sat on the\r\nbenches in Piccadilly and towards morning he strolled down to The\r\nEmbankment. He listened to the striking of Big Ben, marking every\r\nquarter of an hour, and reckoned out how long it left till the city\r\nwoke again. In the morning he spent a few coppers on making himself\r\nneat and clean, bought a paper to read the advertisements, and set out\r\nonce more on the search for work.\r\n\r\nHe went on in this way for several days. He had very little food and\r\nbegan to feel weak and ill, so that he had hardly enough energy to go\r\non looking for the work which seemed so desperately hard to find. He\r\nwas growing used now to the long waiting at the back of a shop on the\r\nchance that he would be taken on, and the curt dismissal. He walked to\r\nall parts of London in answer to the advertisements, and he came to\r\nknow by sight men who applied as fruitlessly as himself. One or two\r\ntried to make friends with him, but he was too tired and too wretched\r\nto accept their advances. He did not go any more to Lawson, because he\r\nowed him five shillings. He began to be too dazed to think clearly and\r\nceased very much to care what would happen to him. He cried a good\r\ndeal. At first he was very angry with himself for this and ashamed, but\r\nhe found it relieved him, and somehow made him feel less hungry. In the\r\nvery early morning he suffered a good deal from cold. One night he went\r\ninto his room to change his linen; he slipped in about three, when he\r\nwas quite sure everyone would be asleep, and out again at five; he lay\r\non the bed and its softness was enchanting; all his bones ached, and as\r\nhe lay he revelled in the pleasure of it; it was so delicious that he\r\ndid not want to go to sleep. He was growing used to want of food and\r\ndid not feel very hungry, but only weak. Constantly now at the back of\r\nhis mind was the thought of doing away with himself, but he used all\r\nthe strength he had not to dwell on it, because he was afraid the\r\ntemptation would get hold of him so that he would not be able to help\r\nhimself. He kept on saying to himself that it would be absurd to commit\r\nsuicide, since something must happen soon; he could not get over the\r\nimpression that his situation was too preposterous to be taken quite\r\nseriously; it was like an illness which must be endured but from which\r\nhe was bound to recover. Every night he swore that nothing would induce\r\nhim to put up with such another and determined next morning to write to\r\nhis uncle, or to Mr. Nixon, the solicitor, or to Lawson; but when the\r\ntime came he could not bring himself to make the humiliating confession\r\nof his utter failure. He did not know how Lawson would take it. In\r\ntheir friendship Lawson had been scatter-brained and he had prided\r\nhimself on his common sense. He would have to tell the whole history of\r\nhis folly. He had an uneasy feeling that Lawson, after helping him,\r\nwould turn the cold shoulder on him. His uncle and the solicitor would\r\nof course do something for him, but he dreaded their reproaches. He did\r\nnot want anyone to reproach him: he clenched his teeth and repeated\r\nthat what had happened was inevitable just because it had happened.\r\nRegret was absurd.\r\n\r\nThe days were unending, and the five shillings Lawson had lent him\r\nwould not last much longer. Philip longed for Sunday to come so that he\r\ncould go to Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s. He did not know what prevented him from going\r\nthere sooner, except perhaps that he wanted so badly to get through on\r\nhis own; for Athelny, who had been in straits as desperate, was the\r\nonly person who could do anything for him. Perhaps after dinner he\r\ncould bring himself to tell Athelny that he was in difficulties. Philip\r\nrepeated to himself over and over again what he should say to him. He\r\nwas dreadfully afraid that Athelny would put him off with airy phrases:\r\nthat would be so horrible that he wanted to delay as long as possible\r\nthe putting of him to the test. Philip had lost all confidence in his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nSaturday night was cold and raw. Philip suffered horribly. From midday\r\non Saturday till he dragged himself wearily to Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s house he ate\r\nnothing. He spent his last twopence on Sunday morning on a wash and a\r\nbrush up in the lavatory at Charing Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Philip rang a head was put out of the window, and in a minute he\r\nheard a noisy clatter on the stairs as the children ran down to let him\r\nin. It was a pale, anxious, thin face that he bent down for them to\r\nkiss. He was so moved by their exuberant affection that, to give\r\nhimself time to recover, he made excuses to linger on the stairs. He\r\nwas in a hysterical state and almost anything was enough to make him\r\ncry. They asked him why he had not come on the previous Sunday, and he\r\ntold them he had been ill; they wanted to know what was the matter with\r\nhim; and Philip, to amuse them, suggested a mysterious ailment, the\r\nname of which, double-barrelled and barbarous with its mixture of Greek\r\nand Latin (medical nomenclature bristled with such), made them shriek\r\nwith delight. They dragged Philip into the parlour and made him repeat\r\nit for their father\xe2\x80\x99s edification. Athelny got up and shook hands with\r\nhim. He stared at Philip, but with his round, bulging eyes he always\r\nseemed to stare, Philip did not know why on this occasion it made him\r\nself-conscious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe missed you last Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPhilip could never tell lies without embarrassment, and he was scarlet\r\nwhen he finished his explanation for not coming. Then Mrs. Athelny\r\nentered and shook hands with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99re better, Mr. Carey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe did not know why she imagined that anything had been the matter with\r\nhim, for the kitchen door was closed when he came up with the children,\r\nand they had not left him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner won\xe2\x80\x99t be ready for another ten minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her slow\r\ndrawl. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you have an egg beaten up in a glass of milk while you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwaiting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a look of concern on her face which made Philip\r\nuncomfortable. He forced a laugh and answered that he was not at all\r\nhungry. Sally came in to lay the table, and Philip began to chaff her.\r\nIt was the family joke that she would be as fat as an aunt of Mrs.\r\nAthelny, called Aunt Elizabeth, whom the children had never seen but\r\nregarded as the type of obscene corpulence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what HAS happened since I saw you last, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing that I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting on weight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a perfect skeleton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a tu quoque, Sally,\xe2\x80\x9d cried her father. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be fined one\r\ngolden hair of your head. Jane, fetch the shears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is thin, father,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Sally. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just skin and\r\nbone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the question, child. He is at perfect liberty to be thin,\r\nbut your obesity is contrary to decorum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he put his arm proudly round her waist and looked at her\r\nwith admiring eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me get on with the table, father. If I am comfortable there are\r\nsome who don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hussy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athelny, with a dramatic wave of the hand. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\ntaunts me with the notorious fact that Joseph, a son of Levi who sells\r\njewels in Holborn, has made her an offer of marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you accepted him, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know father better than that by this time? There\xe2\x80\x99s not a\r\nword of truth in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made you an offer of marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athelny, \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nSaint George and Merry England, I will seize him by the nose and demand\r\nof him immediately what are his intentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, father, dinner\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Now then, you children, get along\r\nwith you and wash your hands all of you, and don\xe2\x80\x99t shirk it, because I\r\nmean to look at them before you have a scrap of dinner, so there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thought he was ravenous till he began to eat, but then\r\ndiscovered that his stomach turned against food, and he could eat\r\nhardly at all. His brain was weary; and he did not notice that Athelny,\r\ncontrary to his habit, spoke very little. Philip was relieved to be\r\nsitting in a comfortable house, but every now and then he could not\r\nprevent himself from glancing out of the window. The day was\r\ntempestuous. The fine weather had broken; and it was cold, and there\r\nwas a bitter wind; now and again gusts of rain drove against the\r\nwindow. Philip wondered what he should do that night. The Athelnys went\r\nto bed early, and he could not stay where he was after ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. His\r\nheart sank at the thought of going out into the bleak darkness. It\r\nseemed more terrible now that he was with his friends than when he was\r\noutside and alone. He kept on saying to himself that there were plenty\r\nmore who would be spending the night out of doors. He strove to\r\ndistract his mind by talking, but in the middle of his words a spatter\r\nof rain against the window would make him start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like March weather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cNot the sort of day one would\r\nlike to be crossing the Channel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently they finished, and Sally came in and cleared away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like a twopenny stinker?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny, handing him a cigar.\r\n\r\nPhilip took it and inhaled the smoke with delight. It soothed him\r\nextraordinarily. When Sally had finished Athelny told her to shut the\r\ndoor after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we shan\xe2\x80\x99t be disturbed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\narranged with Betty not to let the children come in till I call them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip gave him a startled look, but before he could take in the\r\nmeaning of his words, Athelny, fixing his glasses on his nose with the\r\ngesture habitual to him, went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to you last Sunday to ask if anything was the matter with you,\r\nand as you didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer I went to your rooms on Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip turned his head away and did not answer. His heart began to beat\r\nviolently. Athelny did not speak, and presently the silence seemed\r\nintolerable to Philip. He could not think of a single word to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour landlady told me you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been in since Saturday night, and she\r\nsaid you owed her for the last month. Where have you been sleeping all\r\nthis week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made Philip sick to answer. He stared out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetty and I have been just as broke in our day, only we had babies to\r\nlook after. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was afraid he was going to cry. He felt very weak. He shut his\r\neyes and frowned, trying to control himself. He felt a sudden flash of\r\nanger with Athelny because he would not leave him alone; but he was\r\nbroken; and presently, his eyes still closed, slowly in order to keep\r\nhis voice steady, he told him the story of his adventures during the\r\nlast few weeks. As he spoke it seemed to him that he had behaved\r\ninanely, and it made it still harder to tell. He felt that Athelny\r\nwould think him an utter fool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99re coming to live with us till you find something to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthelny, when he had finished.\r\n\r\nPhilip flushed, he knew not why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully kind of you, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not answer. He had refused instinctively from fear that he\r\nwould be a bother, and he had a natural bashfulness of accepting\r\nfavours. He knew besides that the Athelnys lived from hand to mouth,\r\nand with their large family had neither space nor money to entertain a\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you must come here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cThorpe will tuck in with\r\none of his brothers and you can sleep in his bed. You don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nyour food\xe2\x80\x99s going to make any difference to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was afraid to speak, and Athelny, going to the door, called his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when she came in, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s coming to live with\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and get the bed ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke in such a hearty, friendly tone, taking everything for\r\ngranted, that Philip was deeply touched. He never expected people to be\r\nkind to him, and when they were it surprised and moved him. Now he\r\ncould not prevent two large tears from rolling down his cheeks. The\r\nAthelnys discussed the arrangements and pretended not to notice to what\r\na state his weakness had brought him. When Mrs. Athelny left them\r\nPhilip leaned back in his chair, and looking out of the window laughed\r\na little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a very nice night to be out, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCII\r\n\r\n\r\nAthelny told Philip that he could easily get him something to do in the\r\nlarge firm of linendrapers in which himself worked. Several of the\r\nassistants had gone to the war, and Lynn and Sedley with patriotic zeal\r\nhad promised to keep their places open for them. They put the work of\r\nthe heroes on those who remained, and since they did not increase the\r\nwages of these were able at once to exhibit public spirit and effect an\r\neconomy; but the war continued and trade was less depressed; the\r\nholidays were coming, when numbers of the staff went away for a\r\nfortnight at a time: they were bound to engage more assistants.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s experience had made him doubtful whether even then they would\r\nengage him; but Athelny, representing himself as a person of\r\nconsequence in the firm, insisted that the manager could refuse him\r\nnothing. Philip, with his training in Paris, would be very useful; it\r\nwas only a matter of waiting a little and he was bound to get a\r\nwell-paid job to design costumes and draw posters. Philip made a poster\r\nfor the summer sale and Athelny took it away. Two days later he brought\r\nit back, saying that the manager admired it very much and regretted\r\nwith all his heart that there was no vacancy just then in that\r\ndepartment. Philip asked whether there was nothing else he could do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the fact is they\xe2\x80\x99re advertising for a shop-walker tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Athelny, looking at him doubtfully through his glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think I stand any chance of getting it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthelny was a little confused; he had led Philip to expect something\r\nmuch more splendid; on the other hand he was too poor to go on\r\nproviding him indefinitely with board and lodging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might take it while you wait for something better. You always\r\nstand a better chance if you\xe2\x80\x99re engaged by the firm already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not proud, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you decide on that you must be there at a quarter to nine tomorrow\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the war there was evidently much difficulty in finding\r\nwork, for when Philip went to the shop many men were waiting already.\r\nHe recognised some whom he had seen in his own searching, and there was\r\none whom he had noticed lying about the park in the afternoon. To\r\nPhilip now that suggested that he was as homeless as himself and passed\r\nthe night out of doors. The men were of all sorts, old and young, tall\r\nand short; but every one had tried to make himself smart for the\r\ninterview with the manager: they had carefully brushed hair and\r\nscrupulously clean hands. They waited in a passage which Philip learnt\r\nafterwards led up to the dining-hall and the work rooms; it was broken\r\nevery few yards by five or six steps. Though there was electric light\r\nin the shop here was only gas, with wire cages over it for protection,\r\nand it flared noisily. Philip arrived punctually, but it was nearly ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock when he was admitted into the office. It was three-cornered,\r\nlike a cut of cheese lying on its side: on the walls were pictures of\r\nwomen in corsets, and two poster-proofs, one of a man in pyjamas, green\r\nand white in large stripes, and the other of a ship in full sail\r\nploughing an azure sea: on the sail was printed in large letters \xe2\x80\x98great\r\nwhite sale.\xe2\x80\x99 The widest side of the office was the back of one of the\r\nshop-windows, which was being dressed at the time, and an assistant\r\nwent to and fro during the interview. The manager was reading a letter.\r\nHe was a florid man, with sandy hair and a large sandy moustache; from\r\nthe middle of his watch-chain hung a bunch of football medals. He sat\r\nin his shirt sleeves at a large desk with a telephone by his side;\r\nbefore him were the day\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements, Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s work, and cuttings\r\nfrom newspapers pasted on a card. He gave Philip a glance but did not\r\nspeak to him; he dictated a letter to the typist, a girl who sat at a\r\nsmall table in one corner; then he asked Philip his name, age, and what\r\nexperience he had had. He spoke with a cockney twang in a high,\r\nmetallic voice which he seemed not able always to control; Philip\r\nnoticed that his upper teeth were large and protruding; they gave you\r\nthe impression that they were loose and would come out if you gave them\r\na sharp tug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Mr. Athelny has spoken to you about me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are the young feller who did that poster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good to us, you know, not a bit of good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked Philip up and down. He seemed to notice that Philip was in\r\nsome way different from the men who had preceded him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99ave to get a frock coat, you know. I suppose you \xe2\x80\x99aven\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\none. You seem a respectable young feller. I suppose you found art\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip could not tell whether he meant to engage him or not. He threw\r\nremarks at him in a hostile way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father and mother died when I was a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to give young fellers a chance. Many\xe2\x80\x99s the one I\xe2\x80\x99ve given their\r\nchance to and they\xe2\x80\x99re managers of departments now. And they\xe2\x80\x99re grateful\r\nto me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that for them. They know what I done for them. Start at\r\nthe bottom of the ladder, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to learn the business,\r\nand then if you stick to it there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what it can lead to. If\r\nyou suit, one of these days you may find yourself in a position like\r\nwhat mine is. Bear that in mind, young feller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very anxious to do my best, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he must put in the sir whenever he could, but it sounded\r\nodd to him, and he was afraid of overdoing it. The manager liked\r\ntalking. It gave him a happy consciousness of his own importance, and\r\nhe did not give Philip his decision till he had used a great many\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, in a pompous way. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind giving you a trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can start at once. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you six shillings a week and your\r\nkeep. Everything found, you know; the six shillings is only pocket\r\nmoney, to do what you like with, paid monthly. Start on Monday. I\r\nsuppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve got no cause of complaint with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarrington Street, d\xe2\x80\x99you know where that is, Shaftesbury Avenue.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s where you sleep. Number ten, it is. You can sleep there on\r\nSunday night, if you like; that\xe2\x80\x99s just as you please, or you can send\r\nyour box there on Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d The manager nodded: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Athelny lent Philip money to pay his landlady enough of her bill\r\nto let him take his things away. For five shillings and the pawn-ticket\r\non a suit he was able to get from a pawnbroker a frock coat which\r\nfitted him fairly well. He redeemed the rest of his clothes. He sent\r\nhis box to Harrington Street by Carter Patterson and on Monday morning\r\nwent with Athelny to the shop. Athelny introduced him to the buyer of\r\nthe costumes and left him. The buyer was a pleasant, fussy little man\r\nof thirty, named Sampson; he shook hands with Philip, and, in order to\r\nshow his own accomplishment of which he was very proud, asked him if he\r\nspoke French. He was surprised when Philip told him he did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny other language?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak German.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I go over to Paris myself occasionally. Parlez-vous francais? Ever\r\nbeen to Maxim\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was stationed at the top of the stairs in the \xe2\x80\x98costumes.\xe2\x80\x99 His\r\nwork consisted in directing people to the various departments. There\r\nseemed a great many of them as Mr. Sampson tripped them off his tongue.\r\nSuddenly he noticed that Philip limped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with your leg?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a club-foot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent my walking\r\nor anything like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe buyer looked at it for a moment doubtfully, and Philip surmised\r\nthat he was wondering why the manager had engaged him. Philip knew that\r\nhe had not noticed there was anything the matter with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to get them all correct the first day. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nany doubt all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do is to ask one of the young ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sampson turned away; and Philip, trying to remember where this or\r\nthe other department was, watched anxiously for the customer in search\r\nof information. At one o\xe2\x80\x99clock he went up to dinner. The dining-room,\r\non the top floor of the vast building, was large, long, and well lit;\r\nbut all the windows were shut to keep out the dust, and there was a\r\nhorrid smell of cooking. There were long tables covered with cloths,\r\nwith big glass bottles of water at intervals, and down the centre salt\r\ncellars and bottles of vinegar. The assistants crowded in noisily, and\r\nsat down on forms still warm from those who had dined at twelve-thirty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo pickles,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the man next to Philip.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall thin young man, with a hooked nose and a pasty face; he\r\nhad a long head, unevenly shaped as though the skull had been pushed in\r\nhere and there oddly, and on his forehead and neck were large acne\r\nspots red and inflamed. His name was Harris. Philip discovered that on\r\nsome days there were large soup-plates down the table full of mixed\r\npickles. They were very popular. There were no knives and forks, but in\r\na minute a large fat boy in a white coat came in with a couple of\r\nhandfuls of them and threw them loudly on the middle of the table. Each\r\nman took what he wanted; they were warm and greasy from recent washing\r\nin dirty water. Plates of meat swimming in gravy were handed round by\r\nboys in white jackets, and as they flung each plate down with the quick\r\ngesture of a prestidigitator the gravy slopped over on to the\r\ntable-cloth. Then they brought large dishes of cabbages and potatoes;\r\nthe sight of them turned Philip\xe2\x80\x99s stomach; he noticed that everyone\r\npoured quantities of vinegar over them. The noise was awful. They\r\ntalked and laughed and shouted, and there was the clatter of knives and\r\nforks, and strange sounds of eating. Philip was glad to get back into\r\nthe department. He was beginning to remember where each one was, and\r\nhad less often to ask one of the assistants, when somebody wanted to\r\nknow the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst to the right. Second on the left, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne or two of the girls spoke to him, just a word when things were\r\nslack, and he felt they were taking his measure. At five he was sent up\r\nagain to the dining-room for tea. He was glad to sit down. There were\r\nlarge slices of bread heavily spread with butter; and many had pots of\r\njam, which were kept in the \xe2\x80\x98store\xe2\x80\x99 and had their names written on.\r\n\r\nPhilip was exhausted when work stopped at half past six. Harris, the\r\nman he had sat next to at dinner, offered to take him over to\r\nHarrington Street to show him where he was to sleep. He told Philip\r\nthere was a spare bed in his room, and, as the other rooms were full,\r\nhe expected Philip would be put there. The house in Harrington Street\r\nhad been a bootmaker\xe2\x80\x99s; and the shop was used as a bed-room; but it was\r\nvery dark, since the window had been boarded three parts up, and as\r\nthis did not open the only ventilation came from a small skylight at\r\nthe far end. There was a musty smell, and Philip was thankful that he\r\nwould not have to sleep there. Harris took him up to the sitting-room,\r\nwhich was on the first floor; it had an old piano in it with a keyboard\r\nthat looked like a row of decayed teeth; and on the table in a\r\ncigar-box without a lid was a set of dominoes; old numbers of The\r\nStrand Magazine and of The Graphic were lying about. The other rooms\r\nwere used as bed-rooms. That in which Philip was to sleep was at the\r\ntop of the house. There were six beds in it, and a trunk or a box stood\r\nby the side of each. The only furniture was a chest of drawers: it had\r\nfour large drawers and two small ones, and Philip as the new-comer had\r\none of these; there were keys to them, but as they were all alike they\r\nwere not of much use, and Harris advised him to keep his valuables in\r\nhis trunk. There was a looking-glass on the chimney-piece. Harris\r\nshowed Philip the lavatory, which was a fairly large room with eight\r\nbasins in a row, and here all the inmates did their washing. It led\r\ninto another room in which were two baths, discoloured, the woodwork\r\nstained with soap; and in them were dark rings at various intervals\r\nwhich indicated the water marks of different baths.\r\n\r\nWhen Harris and Philip went back to their bed-room they found a tall\r\nman changing his clothes and a boy of sixteen whistling as loud as he\r\ncould while he brushed his hair. In a minute or two without saying a\r\nword to anybody the tall man went out. Harris winked at the boy, and\r\nthe boy, whistling still, winked back. Harris told Philip that the man\r\nwas called Prior; he had been in the army and now served in the silks;\r\nhe kept pretty much to himself, and he went off every night, just like\r\nthat, without so much as a good-evening, to see his girl. Harris went\r\nout too, and only the boy remained to watch Philip curiously while he\r\nunpacked his things. His name was Bell and he was serving his time for\r\nnothing in the haberdashery. He was much interested in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s evening\r\nclothes. He told him about the other men in the room and asked him\r\nevery sort of question about himself. He was a cheerful youth, and in\r\nthe intervals of conversation sang in a half-broken voice snatches of\r\nmusic-hall songs. When Philip had finished he went out to walk about\r\nthe streets and look at the crowd; occasionally he stopped outside the\r\ndoors of restaurants and watched the people going in; he felt hungry,\r\nso he bought a bath bun and ate it while he strolled along. He had been\r\ngiven a latch-key by the prefect, the man who turned out the gas at a\r\nquarter past eleven, but afraid of being locked out he returned in good\r\ntime; he had learned already the system of fines: you had to pay a\r\nshilling if you came in after eleven, and half a crown after a quarter\r\npast, and you were reported besides: if it happened three times you\r\nwere dismissed.\r\n\r\nAll but the soldier were in when Philip arrived and two were already in\r\nbed. Philip was greeted with cries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clarence! Naughty boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe discovered that Bell had dressed up the bolster in his evening\r\nclothes. The boy was delighted with his joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must wear them at the social evening, Clarence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll catch the belle of Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s, if he\xe2\x80\x99s not careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had already heard of the social evenings, for the money stopped\r\nfrom the wages to pay for them was one of the grievances of the staff.\r\nIt was only two shillings a month, and it covered medical attendance\r\nand the use of a library of worn novels; but as four shillings a month\r\nbesides was stopped for washing, Philip discovered that a quarter of\r\nhis six shillings a week would never be paid to him.\r\n\r\nMost of the men were eating thick slices of fat bacon between a roll of\r\nbread cut in two. These sandwiches, the assistants\xe2\x80\x99 usual supper, were\r\nsupplied by a small shop a few doors off at twopence each. The soldier\r\nrolled in; silently, rapidly, took off his clothes and threw himself\r\ninto bed. At ten minutes past eleven the gas gave a big jump and five\r\nminutes later went out. The soldier went to sleep, but the others\r\ncrowded round the big window in their pyjamas and night-shirts and,\r\nthrowing remains of their sandwiches at the women who passed in the\r\nstreet below, shouted to them facetious remarks. The house opposite,\r\nsix storeys high, was a workshop for Jewish tailors who left off work\r\nat eleven; the rooms were brightly lit and there were no blinds to the\r\nwindows. The sweater\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\xe2\x80\x94the family consisted of father, mother,\r\ntwo small boys, and a girl of twenty\xe2\x80\x94went round the house to put out\r\nthe lights when work was over, and sometimes she allowed herself to be\r\nmade love to by one of the tailors. The shop assistants in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom got a lot of amusement out of watching the manoeuvres of one man\r\nor another to stay behind, and they made small bets on which would\r\nsucceed. At midnight the people were turned out of the Harrington Arms\r\nat the end of the street, and soon after they all went to bed: Bell,\r\nwho slept nearest the door, made his way across the room by jumping\r\nfrom bed to bed, and even when he got to his own would not stop\r\ntalking. At last everything was silent but for the steady snoring of\r\nthe soldier, and Philip went to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe was awaked at seven by the loud ringing of a bell, and by a quarter\r\nto eight they were all dressed and hurrying downstairs in their\r\nstockinged feet to pick out their boots. They laced them as they ran\r\nalong to the shop in Oxford Street for breakfast. If they were a minute\r\nlater than eight they got none, nor, once in, were they allowed out to\r\nget themselves anything to eat. Sometimes, if they knew they could not\r\nget into the building in time, they stopped at the little shop near\r\ntheir quarters and bought a couple of buns; but this cost money, and\r\nmost went without food till dinner. Philip ate some bread and butter,\r\ndrank a cup of tea, and at half past eight began his day\xe2\x80\x99s work again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst to the right. Second on the left, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon he began to answer the questions quite mechanically. The work was\r\nmonotonous and very tiring. After a few days his feet hurt him so that\r\nhe could hardly stand: the thick soft carpets made them burn, and at\r\nnight his socks were painful to remove. It was a common complaint, and\r\nhis fellow \xe2\x80\x98floormen\xe2\x80\x99 told him that socks and boots just rotted away\r\nfrom the continual sweating. All the men in his room suffered in the\r\nsame fashion, and they relieved the pain by sleeping with their feet\r\noutside the bed-clothes. At first Philip could not walk at all and was\r\nobliged to spend a good many of his evenings in the sitting-room at\r\nHarrington Street with his feet in a pail of cold water. His companion\r\non these occasions was Bell, the lad in the haberdashery, who stayed in\r\noften to arrange the stamps he collected. As he fastened them with\r\nlittle pieces of stamp-paper he whistled monotonously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe social evenings took place on alternate Mondays. There was one at\r\nthe beginning of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s second week at Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s. He arranged to go with\r\none of the women in his department.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet \xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x99alf-way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9csame as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was Mrs. Hodges, a little woman of five-and-forty, with badly dyed\r\nhair; she had a yellow face with a network of small red veins all over\r\nit, and yellow whites to her pale blue eyes. She took a fancy to Philip\r\nand called him by his Christian name before he had been in the shop a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve both known what it is to come down,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe told Philip that her real name was not Hodges, but she always\r\nreferred to \xe2\x80\x9cme \xe2\x80\x99usband Misterodges;\xe2\x80\x9d he was a barrister and he treated\r\nher simply shocking, so she left him as she preferred to be independent\r\nlike; but she had known what it was to drive in her own carriage,\r\ndear\xe2\x80\x94she called everyone dear\xe2\x80\x94and they always had late dinner at home.\r\nShe used to pick her teeth with the pin of an enormous silver brooch.\r\nIt was in the form of a whip and a hunting-crop crossed, with two spurs\r\nin the middle. Philip was ill at ease in his new surroundings, and the\r\ngirls in the shop called him \xe2\x80\x98sidey.\xe2\x80\x99 One addressed him as Phil, and he\r\ndid not answer because he had not the least idea that she was speaking\r\nto him; so she tossed her head, saying he was a \xe2\x80\x98stuck-up thing,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nnext time with ironical emphasis called him Mister Carey. She was a\r\nMiss Jewell, and she was going to marry a doctor. The other girls had\r\nnever seen him, but they said he must be a gentleman as he gave her\r\nsuch lovely presents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind what they say, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hodges. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x99ad to go\r\nthrough it same as you \xe2\x80\x99ave. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know any better, poor things.\r\nYou take my word for it, they\xe2\x80\x99ll like you all right if you \xe2\x80\x99old your\r\nown same as I \xe2\x80\x99ave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe social evening was held in the restaurant in the basement. The\r\ntables were put on one side so that there might be room for dancing,\r\nand smaller ones were set out for progressive whist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x99eads \xe2\x80\x99ave to get there early,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hodges.\r\n\r\nShe introduced him to Miss Bennett, who was the belle of Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s. She\r\nwas the buyer in the \xe2\x80\x98Petticoats,\xe2\x80\x99 and when Philip entered was engaged\r\nin conversation with the buyer in the \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s Hosiery;\xe2\x80\x99 Miss\r\nBennett was a woman of massive proportions, with a very large red face\r\nheavily powdered and a bust of imposing dimensions; her flaxen hair was\r\narranged with elaboration. She was overdressed, but not badly dressed,\r\nin black with a high collar, and she wore black glace gloves, in which\r\nshe played cards; she had several heavy gold chains round her neck,\r\nbangles on her wrists, and circular photograph pendants, one being of\r\nQueen Alexandra; she carried a black satin bag and chewed Sen-sens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to meet you, Mr. Carey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is your first visit to\r\nour social evenings, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? I expect you feel a bit shy, but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno cause to, I promise you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did her best to make people feel at home. She slapped them on the\r\nshoulders and laughed a great deal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t I a pickle?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, turning to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must you think\r\nof me? But I can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99elp meself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose who were going to take part in the social evening came in, the\r\nyounger members of the staff mostly, boys who had not girls of their\r\nown, and girls who had not yet found anyone to walk with. Several of\r\nthe young gentlemen wore lounge suits with white evening ties and red\r\nsilk handkerchiefs; they were going to perform, and they had a busy,\r\nabstracted air; some were self-confident, but others were nervous, and\r\nthey watched their public with an anxious eye. Presently a girl with a\r\ngreat deal of hair sat at the piano and ran her hands noisily across\r\nthe keyboard. When the audience had settled itself she looked round and\r\ngave the name of her piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Drive in Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a round of clapping during which she deftly fixed bells to\r\nher wrists. She smiled a little and immediately burst into energetic\r\nmelody. There was a great deal more clapping when she finished, and\r\nwhen this was over, as an encore, she gave a piece which imitated the\r\nsea; there were little trills to represent the lapping waves and\r\nthundering chords, with the loud pedal down, to suggest a storm. After\r\nthis a gentleman sang a song called Bid me Good-bye, and as an encore\r\nobliged with Sing me to Sleep. The audience measured their enthusiasm\r\nwith a nice discrimination. Everyone was applauded till he gave an\r\nencore, and so that there might be no jealousy no one was applauded\r\nmore than anyone else. Miss Bennett sailed up to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you play or sing, Mr. Carey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said archly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see it\r\nin your face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you even recite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no parlour tricks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe buyer in the \xe2\x80\x98gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s hosiery\xe2\x80\x99 was a well-known reciter, and he\r\nwas called upon loudly to perform by all the assistants in his\r\ndepartment. Needing no pressing, he gave a long poem of tragic\r\ncharacter, in which he rolled his eyes, put his hand on his chest, and\r\nacted as though he were in great agony. The point, that he had eaten\r\ncucumber for supper, was divulged in the last line and was greeted with\r\nlaughter, a little forced because everyone knew the poem well, but loud\r\nand long. Miss Bennett did not sing, play, or recite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, she \xe2\x80\x99as a little game of her own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hodges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you begin chaffing me. The fact is I know quite a lot about\r\npalmistry and second sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do tell my \xe2\x80\x99and, Miss Bennett,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girls in her department,\r\neager to please her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like telling \xe2\x80\x99ands, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told people such\r\nterrible things and they\xe2\x80\x99ve all come true, it makes one superstitious\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Bennett, just for once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little crowd collected round her, and, amid screams of embarrassment,\r\ngiggles, blushings, and cries of dismay or admiration, she talked\r\nmysteriously of fair and dark men, of money in a letter, and of\r\njourneys, till the sweat stood in heavy beads on her painted face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all of a perspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSupper was at nine. There were cakes, buns, sandwiches, tea and coffee,\r\nall free; but if you wanted mineral water you had to pay for it.\r\nGallantry often led young men to offer the ladies ginger beer, but\r\ncommon decency made them refuse. Miss Bennett was very fond of ginger\r\nbeer, and she drank two and sometimes three bottles during the evening;\r\nbut she insisted on paying for them herself. The men liked her for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a rum old bird,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut mind you, she\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad sort,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not like what some are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter supper progressive whist was played. This was very noisy, and\r\nthere was a great deal of laughing and shouting, as people moved from\r\ntable to table. Miss Bennett grew hotter and hotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all of a perspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn due course one of the more dashing of the young men remarked that if\r\nthey wanted to dance they\xe2\x80\x99d better begin. The girl who had played the\r\naccompaniments sat at the piano and placed a decided foot on the loud\r\npedal. She played a dreamy waltz, marking the time with the bass, while\r\nwith the right hand she \xe2\x80\x98tiddled\xe2\x80\x99 in alternate octaves. By way of a\r\nchange she crossed her hands and played the air in the bass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does play well, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Hodges remarked to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s more she\xe2\x80\x99s never \xe2\x80\x99ad a lesson in \xe2\x80\x99er life; it\xe2\x80\x99s all ear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bennett liked dancing and poetry better than anything in the\r\nworld. She danced well, but very, very slowly, and an expression came\r\ninto her eyes as though her thoughts were far, far away. She talked\r\nbreathlessly of the floor and the heat and the supper. She said that\r\nthe Portman Rooms had the best floor in London and she always liked the\r\ndances there; they were very select, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear dancing with\r\nall sorts of men you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about; why, you might be\r\nexposing yourself to you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what all. Nearly all the people\r\ndanced very well, and they enjoyed themselves. Sweat poured down their\r\nfaces, and the very high collars of the young men grew limp.\r\n\r\nPhilip looked on, and a greater depression seized him than he\r\nremembered to have felt for a long time. He felt intolerably alone. He\r\ndid not go, because he was afraid to seem supercilious, and he talked\r\nwith the girls and laughed, but in his heart was unhappiness. Miss\r\nBennett asked him if he had a girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty to choose from here. And they\xe2\x80\x99re very nice\r\nrespectable girls, some of them. I expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a girl before\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been here long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him very archly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet \xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x99alf-way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hodges. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the party broke up. Philip could not\r\nget to sleep. Like the others he kept his aching feet outside the\r\nbed-clothes. He tried with all his might not to think of the life he\r\nwas leading. The soldier was snoring quietly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wages were paid once a month by the secretary. On pay-day each\r\nbatch of assistants, coming down from tea, went into the passage and\r\njoined the long line of people waiting orderly like the audience in a\r\nqueue outside a gallery door. One by one they entered the office. The\r\nsecretary sat at a desk with wooden bowls of money in front of him, and\r\nhe asked the employe\xe2\x80\x99s name; he referred to a book, quickly, after a\r\nsuspicious glance at the assistant, said aloud the sum due, and taking\r\nmoney out of the bowl counted it into his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNext.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\nThe assistant passed on to the second secretary and before leaving the\r\nroom paid him four shillings for washing money, two shillings for the\r\nclub, and any fines that he might have incurred. With what he had left\r\nhe went back into his department and there waited till it was time to\r\ngo. Most of the men in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s house were in debt with the woman who\r\nsold the sandwiches they generally ate for supper. She was a funny old\r\nthing, very fat, with a broad, red face, and black hair plastered\r\nneatly on each side of the forehead in the fashion shown in early\r\npictures of Queen Victoria. She always wore a little black bonnet and a\r\nwhite apron; her sleeves were tucked up to the elbow; she cut the\r\nsandwiches with large, dirty, greasy hands; and there was grease on her\r\nbodice, grease on her apron, grease on her skirt. She was called Mrs.\r\nFletcher, but everyone addressed her as \xe2\x80\x98Ma\xe2\x80\x99; she was really fond of\r\nthe shop assistants, whom she called her boys; she never minded giving\r\ncredit towards the end of the month, and it was known that now and then\r\nshe had lent someone or other a few shillings when he was in straits.\r\nShe was a good woman. When they were leaving or when they came back\r\nfrom the holidays, the boys kissed her fat red cheek; and more than\r\none, dismissed and unable to find another job, had got for nothing food\r\nto keep body and soul together. The boys were sensible of her large\r\nheart and repaid her with genuine affection. There was a story they\r\nliked to tell of a man who had done well for himself at Bradford, and\r\nhad five shops of his own, and had come back after fifteen years and\r\nvisited Ma Fletcher and given her a gold watch.\r\n\r\nPhilip found himself with eighteen shillings left out of his month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npay. It was the first money he had ever earned in his life. It gave him\r\nnone of the pride which might have been expected, but merely a feeling\r\nof dismay. The smallness of the sum emphasised the hopelessness of his\r\nposition. He took fifteen shillings to Mrs. Athelny to pay back part of\r\nwhat he owed her, but she would not take more than half a sovereign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know, at that rate it\xe2\x80\x99ll take me eight months to settle up with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s in work I can afford to wait, and who knows,\r\np\xe2\x80\x99raps they\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a rise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthelny kept on saying that he would speak to the manager about Philip,\r\nit was absurd that no use should be made of his talents; but he did\r\nnothing, and Philip soon came to the conclusion that the press-agent\r\nwas not a person of so much importance in the manager\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as in his\r\nown. Occasionally he saw Athelny in the shop. His flamboyance was\r\nextinguished; and in neat, commonplace, shabby clothes he hurried, a\r\nsubdued, unassuming little man, through the departments as though\r\nanxious to escape notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I think of how I\xe2\x80\x99m wasted there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at home, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m almost\r\ntempted to give in my notice. There\xe2\x80\x99s no scope for a man like me. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nstunted, I\xe2\x80\x99m starved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Athelny, quietly sewing, took no notice of his complaints. Her\r\nmouth tightened a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to get jobs in these times. It\xe2\x80\x99s regular and it\xe2\x80\x99s safe;\r\nI expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay there as long as you give satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Athelny would. It was interesting to see the\r\nascendency which the uneducated woman, bound to him by no legal tie,\r\nhad acquired over the brilliant, unstable man. Mrs. Athelny treated\r\nPhilip with motherly kindness now that he was in a different position,\r\nand he was touched by her anxiety that he should make a good meal. It\r\nwas the solace of his life (and when he grew used to it, the monotony\r\nof it was what chiefly appalled him) that he could go every Sunday to\r\nthat friendly house. It was a joy to sit in the stately Spanish chairs\r\nand discuss all manner of things with Athelny. Though his condition\r\nseemed so desperate he never left him to go back to Harrington Street\r\nwithout a feeling of exultation. At first Philip, in order not to\r\nforget what he had learned, tried to go on reading his medical books,\r\nbut he found it useless; he could not fix his attention on them after\r\nthe exhausting work of the day; and it seemed hopeless to continue\r\nworking when he did not know in how long he would be able to go back to\r\nthe hospital. He dreamed constantly that he was in the wards. The\r\nawakening was painful. The sensation of other people sleeping in the\r\nroom was inexpressibly irksome to him; he had been used to solitude,\r\nand to be with others always, never to be by himself for an instant was\r\nat these moments horrible to him. It was then that he found it most\r\ndifficult to combat his despair. He saw himself going on with that\r\nlife, first to the right, second on the left, madam, indefinitely; and\r\nhaving to be thankful if he was not sent away: the men who had gone to\r\nthe war would be coming home soon, the firm had guaranteed to take them\r\nback, and this must mean that others would be sacked; he would have to\r\nstir himself even to keep the wretched post he had.\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing to free him and that was the death of his\r\nuncle. He would get a few hundred pounds then, and on this he could\r\nfinish his course at the hospital. Philip began to wish with all his\r\nmight for the old man\xe2\x80\x99s death. He reckoned out how long he could\r\npossibly live: he was well over seventy, Philip did not know his exact\r\nage, but he must be at least seventy-five; he suffered from chronic\r\nbronchitis and every winter had a bad cough. Though he knew them by\r\nheart Philip read over and over again the details in his text-book of\r\nmedicine of chronic bronchitis in the old. A severe winter might be too\r\nmuch for the old man. With all his heart Philip longed for cold and\r\nrain. He thought of it constantly, so that it became a monomania. Uncle\r\nWilliam was affected by the great heat too, and in August they had\r\nthree weeks of sweltering weather. Philip imagined to himself that one\r\nday perhaps a telegram would come saying that the Vicar had died\r\nsuddenly, and he pictured to himself his unutterable relief. As he\r\nstood at the top of the stairs and directed people to the departments\r\nthey wanted, he occupied his mind with thinking incessantly what he\r\nwould do with the money. He did not know how much it would be, perhaps\r\nno more than five hundred pounds, but even that would be enough. He\r\nwould leave the shop at once, he would not bother to give notice, he\r\nwould pack his box and go without saying a word to anybody; and then he\r\nwould return to the hospital. That was the first thing. Would he have\r\nforgotten much? In six months he could get it all back, and then he\r\nwould take his three examinations as soon as he could, midwifery first,\r\nthen medicine and surgery. The awful fear seized him that his uncle,\r\nnotwithstanding his promises, might leave everything he had to the\r\nparish or the church. The thought made Philip sick. He could not be so\r\ncruel. But if that happened Philip was quite determined what to do, he\r\nwould not go on in that way indefinitely; his life was only tolerable\r\nbecause he could look forward to something better. If he had no hope he\r\nwould have no fear. The only brave thing to do then would be to commit\r\nsuicide, and, thinking this over too, Philip decided minutely what\r\npainless drug he would take and how he would get hold of it. It\r\nencouraged him to think that, if things became unendurable, he had at\r\nall events a way out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond to the right, madam, and down the stairs. First on the left and\r\nstraight through. Mr. Philips, forward please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce a month, for a week, Philip was \xe2\x80\x98on duty.\xe2\x80\x99 He had to go to the\r\ndepartment at seven in the morning and keep an eye on the sweepers.\r\nWhen they finished he had to take the sheets off the cases and the\r\nmodels. Then, in the evening when the assistants left, he had to put\r\nback the sheets on the models and the cases and \xe2\x80\x98gang\xe2\x80\x99 the sweepers\r\nagain. It was a dusty, dirty job. He was not allowed to read or write\r\nor smoke, but just had to walk about, and the time hung heavily on his\r\nhands. When he went off at half past nine he had supper given him, and\r\nthis was the only consolation; for tea at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock had left him\r\nwith a healthy appetite, and the bread and cheese, the abundant cocoa\r\nwhich the firm provided, were welcome.\r\n\r\nOne day when Philip had been at Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s for three months, Mr. Sampson,\r\nthe buyer, came into the department, fuming with anger. The manager,\r\nhappening to notice the costume window as he came in, had sent for the\r\nbuyer and made satirical remarks upon the colour scheme. Forced to\r\nsubmit in silence to his superior\xe2\x80\x99s sarcasm, Mr. Sampson took it out of\r\nthe assistants; and he rated the wretched fellow whose duty it was to\r\ndress the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want a thing well done you must do it yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sampson\r\nstormed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always said it and I always shall. One can\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nanything to you chaps. Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?\r\nIntelligent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw the word at the assistants as though it were the bitterest\r\nterm of reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that if you put an electric blue in the window it\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nkill all the other blues?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked round the department ferociously, and his eye fell upon\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll dress the window next Friday, Carey. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what you can\r\nmake of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went into his office, muttering angrily. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank. When\r\nFriday morning came he went into the window with a sickening sense of\r\nshame. His cheeks were burning. It was horrible to display himself to\r\nthe passers-by, and though he told himself it was foolish to give way\r\nto such a feeling he turned his back to the street. There was not much\r\nchance that any of the students at the hospital would pass along Oxford\r\nStreet at that hour, and he knew hardly anyone else in London; but as\r\nPhilip worked, with a huge lump in his throat, he fancied that on\r\nturning round he would catch the eye of some man he knew. He made all\r\nthe haste he could. By the simple observation that all reds went\r\ntogether, and by spacing the costumes more than was usual, Philip got a\r\nvery good effect; and when the buyer went into the street to look at\r\nthe result he was obviously pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go far wrong in putting you on the window. The fact\r\nis, you and me are gentlemen, mind you I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say this in the\r\ndepartment, but you and me are gentlemen, and that always tells. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno good your telling me it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell, because I know it does tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was put on the job regularly, but he could not accustom himself\r\nto the publicity; and he dreaded Friday morning, on which the window\r\nwas dressed, with a terror that made him awake at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock and lie\r\nsleepless with sickness in his heart. The girls in the department\r\nnoticed his shamefaced way, and they very soon discovered his trick of\r\nstanding with his back to the street. They laughed at him and called\r\nhim \xe2\x80\x98sidey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid your aunt\xe2\x80\x99ll come along and cut you out of her\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the whole he got on well enough with the girls. They thought him a\r\nlittle queer; but his club-foot seemed to excuse his not being like the\r\nrest, and they found in due course that he was good-natured. He never\r\nminded helping anyone, and he was polite and even tempered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see he\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery reserved, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said one young woman, to whose passionate\r\nenthusiasm for the theatre he had listened unmoved.\r\n\r\nMost of them had \xe2\x80\x98fellers,\xe2\x80\x99 and those who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said they had rather\r\nthan have it supposed that no one had an inclination for them. One or\r\ntwo showed signs of being willing to start a flirtation with Philip,\r\nand he watched their manoeuvres with grave amusement. He had had enough\r\nof love-making for some time; and he was nearly always tired and often\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVI\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip avoided the places he had known in happier times. The little\r\ngatherings at the tavern in Beak Street were broken up: Macalister,\r\nhaving let down his friends, no longer went there, and Hayward was at\r\nthe Cape. Only Lawson remained; and Philip, feeling that now the\r\npainter and he had nothing in common, did not wish to see him; but one\r\nSaturday afternoon, after dinner, having changed his clothes he walked\r\ndown Regent Street to go to the free library in St. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s Lane,\r\nmeaning to spend the afternoon there, and suddenly found himself face\r\nto face with him. His first instinct was to pass on without a word, but\r\nLawson did not give him the opportunity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere on earth have you been all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote you and asked you to come to the studio for a beano and you\r\nnever even answered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t get your letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I know. I went to the hospital to ask for you, and I saw my letter\r\nin the rack. Have you chucked the Medical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip hesitated for a moment. He was ashamed to tell the truth, but\r\nthe shame he felt angered him, and he forced himself to speak. He could\r\nnot help reddening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I lost the little money I had. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to go on with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry. What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a shop-walker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words choked Philip, but he was determined not to shirk the truth.\r\nHe kept his eyes on Lawson and saw his embarrassment. Philip smiled\r\nsavagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you went into Lynn and Sedley, and made your way into the \xe2\x80\x98made\r\nrobes\xe2\x80\x99 department, you would see me in a frock coat, walking about with\r\na degage air and directing ladies who want to buy petticoats or\r\nstockings. First to the right, madam, and second on the left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson, seeing that Philip was making a jest of it, laughed awkwardly.\r\nHe did not know what to say. The picture that Philip called up\r\nhorrified him, but he was afraid to show his sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a change for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHis words seemed absurd to him, and immediately he wished he had not\r\nsaid them. Philip flushed darkly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I owe you five bob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some silver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson received the money silently. They stood in the middle of the\r\npavement, and people jostled them as they passed. There was a sardonic\r\ntwinkle in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, which made the painter intensely\r\nuncomfortable, and he could not tell that Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart was heavy with\r\ndespair. Lawson wanted dreadfully to do something, but he did not know\r\nwhat to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, won\xe2\x80\x99t you come to the studio and have a talk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to talk about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw the pain come into Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, he could not help it, he was\r\nsorry, but he had to think of himself; he could not bear the thought of\r\ndiscussing his situation, he could endure it only by determining\r\nresolutely not to think about it. He was afraid of his weakness if once\r\nhe began to open his heart. Moreover, he took irresistible dislikes to\r\nthe places where he had been miserable: he remembered the humiliation\r\nhe had endured when he had waited in that studio, ravenous with hunger,\r\nfor Lawson to offer him a meal, and the last occasion when he had taken\r\nthe five shillings off him. He hated the sight of Lawson, because he\r\nrecalled those days of utter abasement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen look here, come and dine with me one night. Choose your own\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was touched with the painter\xe2\x80\x99s kindness. All sorts of people\r\nwere strangely kind to him, he thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully good of you, old man, but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not.\xe2\x80\x9d He held out\r\nhis hand. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson, troubled by a behaviour which seemed inexplicable, took his\r\nhand, and Philip quickly limped away. His heart was heavy; and, as was\r\nusual with him, he began to reproach himself for what he had done: he\r\ndid not know what madness of pride had made him refuse the offered\r\nfriendship. But he heard someone running behind him and presently\r\nLawson\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling him; he stopped and suddenly the feeling of\r\nhostility got the better of him; he presented to Lawson a cold, set\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you heard about Hayward, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he went to the Cape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe died, you know, soon after landing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Philip did not answer. He could hardly believe his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, enteric. Hard luck, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I thought you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t know. Gave\r\nme a bit of a turn when I heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawson nodded quickly and walked away. Philip felt a shiver pass\r\nthrough his heart. He had never before lost a friend of his own age,\r\nfor the death of Cronshaw, a man so much older than himself, had seemed\r\nto come in the normal course of things. The news gave him a peculiar\r\nshock. It reminded him of his own mortality, for like everyone else\r\nPhilip, knowing perfectly that all men must die, had no intimate\r\nfeeling that the same must apply to himself; and Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nthough he had long ceased to have any warm feeling for him, affected\r\nhim deeply. He remembered on a sudden all the good talks they had had,\r\nand it pained him to think that they would never talk with one another\r\nagain; he remembered their first meeting and the pleasant months they\r\nhad spent together in Heidelberg. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank as he thought of\r\nthe lost years. He walked on mechanically, not noticing where he went,\r\nand realised suddenly, with a movement of irritation, that instead of\r\nturning down the Haymarket he had sauntered along Shaftesbury Avenue.\r\nIt bored him to retrace his steps; and besides, with that news, he did\r\nnot want to read, he wanted to sit alone and think. He made up his mind\r\nto go to the British Museum. Solitude was now his only luxury. Since he\r\nhad been at Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s he had often gone there and sat in front of the\r\ngroups from the Parthenon; and, not deliberately thinking, had allowed\r\ntheir divine masses to rest his troubled soul. But this afternoon they\r\nhad nothing to say to him, and after a few minutes, impatiently, he\r\nwandered out of the room. There were too many people, provincials with\r\nfoolish faces, foreigners poring over guide-books; their hideousness\r\nbesmirched the everlasting masterpieces, their restlessness troubled\r\nthe god\xe2\x80\x99s immortal repose. He went into another room and here there was\r\nhardly anyone. Philip sat down wearily. His nerves were on edge. He\r\ncould not get the people out of his mind. Sometimes at Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s they\r\naffected him in the same way, and he looked at them file past him with\r\nhorror; they were so ugly and there was such meanness in their faces,\r\nit was terrifying; their features were distorted with paltry desires,\r\nand you felt they were strange to any ideas of beauty. They had furtive\r\neyes and weak chins. There was no wickedness in them, but only\r\npettiness and vulgarity. Their humour was a low facetiousness.\r\nSometimes he found himself looking at them to see what animal they\r\nresembled (he tried not to, for it quickly became an obsession,) and he\r\nsaw in them all the sheep or the horse or the fox or the goat. Human\r\nbeings filled him with disgust.\r\n\r\nBut presently the influence of the place descended upon him. He felt\r\nquieter. He began to look absently at the tombstones with which the\r\nroom was lined. They were the work of Athenian stone masons of the\r\nfourth and fifth centuries before Christ, and they were very simple,\r\nwork of no great talent but with the exquisite spirit of Athens upon\r\nthem; time had mellowed the marble to the colour of honey, so that\r\nunconsciously one thought of the bees of Hymettus, and softened their\r\noutlines. Some represented a nude figure, seated on a bench, some the\r\ndeparture of the dead from those who loved him, and some the dead\r\nclasping hands with one who remained behind. On all was the tragic word\r\nfarewell; that and nothing more. Their simplicity was infinitely\r\ntouching. Friend parted from friend, the son from his mother, and the\r\nrestraint made the survivor\xe2\x80\x99s grief more poignant. It was so long, long\r\nago, and century upon century had passed over that unhappiness; for two\r\nthousand years those who wept had been dust as those they wept for. Yet\r\nthe woe was alive still, and it filled Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart so that he felt\r\ncompassion spring up in it, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor things, poor things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it came to him that the gaping sight-seers and the fat strangers\r\nwith their guide-books, and all those mean, common people who thronged\r\nthe shop, with their trivial desires and vulgar cares, were mortal and\r\nmust die. They too loved and must part from those they loved, the son\r\nfrom his mother, the wife from her husband; and perhaps it was more\r\ntragic because their lives were ugly and sordid, and they knew nothing\r\nthat gave beauty to the world. There was one stone which was very\r\nbeautiful, a bas relief of two young men holding each other\xe2\x80\x99s hand; and\r\nthe reticence of line, the simplicity, made one like to think that the\r\nsculptor here had been touched with a genuine emotion. It was an\r\nexquisite memorial to that than which the world offers but one thing\r\nmore precious, to a friendship; and as Philip looked at it, he felt the\r\ntears come to his eyes. He thought of Hayward and his eager admiration\r\nfor him when first they met, and how disillusion had come and then\r\nindifference, till nothing held them together but habit and old\r\nmemories. It was one of the queer things of life that you saw a person\r\nevery day for months and were so intimate with him that you could not\r\nimagine existence without him; then separation came, and everything\r\nwent on in the same way, and the companion who had seemed essential\r\nproved unnecessary. Your life proceeded and you did not even miss him.\r\nPhilip thought of those early days in Heidelberg when Hayward, capable\r\nof great things, had been full of enthusiasm for the future, and how,\r\nlittle by little, achieving nothing, he had resigned himself to\r\nfailure. Now he was dead. His death had been as futile as his life. He\r\ndied ingloriously, of a stupid disease, failing once more, even at the\r\nend, to accomplish anything. It was just the same now as if he had\r\nnever lived.\r\n\r\nPhilip asked himself desperately what was the use of living at all. It\r\nall seemed inane. It was the same with Cronshaw: it was quite\r\nunimportant that he had lived; he was dead and forgotten, his book of\r\npoems sold in remainder by second-hand booksellers; his life seemed to\r\nhave served nothing except to give a pushing journalist occasion to\r\nwrite an article in a review. And Philip cried out in his soul:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effort was so incommensurate with the result. The bright hopes of\r\nyouth had to be paid for at such a bitter price of disillusionment.\r\nPain and disease and unhappiness weighed down the scale so heavily.\r\nWhat did it all mean? He thought of his own life, the high hopes with\r\nwhich he had entered upon it, the limitations which his body forced\r\nupon him, his friendlessness, and the lack of affection which had\r\nsurrounded his youth. He did not know that he had ever done anything\r\nbut what seemed best to do, and what a cropper he had come! Other men,\r\nwith no more advantages than he, succeeded, and others again, with many\r\nmore, failed. It seemed pure chance. The rain fell alike upon the just\r\nand upon the unjust, and for nothing was there a why and a wherefore.\r\n\r\nThinking of Cronshaw, Philip remembered the Persian rug which he had\r\ngiven him, telling him that it offered an answer to his question upon\r\nthe meaning of life; and suddenly the answer occurred to him: he\r\nchuckled: now that he had it, it was like one of the puzzles which you\r\nworry over till you are shown the solution and then cannot imagine how\r\nit could ever have escaped you. The answer was obvious. Life had no\r\nmeaning. On the earth, satellite of a star speeding through space,\r\nliving things had arisen under the influence of conditions which were\r\npart of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s history; and as there had been a beginning of life\r\nupon it so, under the influence of other conditions, there would be an\r\nend: man, no more significant than other forms of life, had come not as\r\nthe climax of creation but as a physical reaction to the environment.\r\nPhilip remembered the story of the Eastern King who, desiring to know\r\nthe history of man, was brought by a sage five hundred volumes; busy\r\nwith affairs of state, he bade him go and condense it; in twenty years\r\nthe sage returned and his history now was in no more than fifty\r\nvolumes, but the King, too old then to read so many ponderous tomes,\r\nbade him go and shorten it once more; twenty years passed again and the\r\nsage, old and gray, brought a single book in which was the knowledge\r\nthe King had sought; but the King lay on his death-bed, and he had no\r\ntime to read even that; and then the sage gave him the history of man\r\nin a single line; it was this: he was born, he suffered, and he died.\r\nThere was no meaning in life, and man by living served no end. It was\r\nimmaterial whether he was born or not born, whether he lived or ceased\r\nto live. Life was insignificant and death without consequence. Philip\r\nexulted, as he had exulted in his boyhood when the weight of a belief\r\nin God was lifted from his shoulders: it seemed to him that the last\r\nburden of responsibility was taken from him; and for the first time he\r\nwas utterly free. His insignificance was turned to power, and he felt\r\nhimself suddenly equal with the cruel fate which had seemed to\r\npersecute him; for, if life was meaningless, the world was robbed of\r\nits cruelty. What he did or left undone did not matter. Failure was\r\nunimportant and success amounted to nothing. He was the most\r\ninconsiderate creature in that swarming mass of mankind which for a\r\nbrief space occupied the surface of the earth; and he was almighty\r\nbecause he had wrenched from chaos the secret of its nothingness.\r\nThoughts came tumbling over one another in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eager fancy, and he\r\ntook long breaths of joyous satisfaction. He felt inclined to leap and\r\nsing. He had not been so happy for months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, life,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in his heart, \xe2\x80\x9cOh life, where is thy sting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the same uprush of fancy which had shown him with all the force of\r\nmathematical demonstration that life had no meaning, brought with it\r\nanother idea; and that was why Cronshaw, he imagined, had given him the\r\nPersian rug. As the weaver elaborated his pattern for no end but the\r\npleasure of his aesthetic sense, so might a man live his life, or if\r\none was forced to believe that his actions were outside his choosing,\r\nso might a man look at his life, that it made a pattern. There was as\r\nlittle need to do this as there was use. It was merely something he did\r\nfor his own pleasure. Out of the manifold events of his life, his\r\ndeeds, his feelings, his thoughts, he might make a design, regular,\r\nelaborate, complicated, or beautiful; and though it might be no more\r\nthan an illusion that he had the power of selection, though it might be\r\nno more than a fantastic legerdemain in which appearances were\r\ninterwoven with moonbeams, that did not matter: it seemed, and so to\r\nhim it was. In the vast warp of life (a river arising from no spring\r\nand flowing endlessly to no sea), with the background to his fancies\r\nthat there was no meaning and that nothing was important, a man might\r\nget a personal satisfaction in selecting the various strands that\r\nworked out the pattern. There was one pattern, the most obvious,\r\nperfect, and beautiful, in which a man was born, grew to manhood,\r\nmarried, produced children, toiled for his bread, and died; but there\r\nwere others, intricate and wonderful, in which happiness did not enter\r\nand in which success was not attempted; and in them might be discovered\r\na more troubling grace. Some lives, and Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s was among them, the\r\nblind indifference of chance cut off while the design was still\r\nimperfect; and then the solace was comfortable that it did not matter;\r\nother lives, such as Cronshaw\xe2\x80\x99s, offered a pattern which was difficult\r\nto follow, the point of view had to be shifted and old standards had to\r\nbe altered before one could understand that such a life was its own\r\njustification. Philip thought that in throwing over the desire for\r\nhappiness he was casting aside the last of his illusions. His life had\r\nseemed horrible when it was measured by its happiness, but now he\r\nseemed to gather strength as he realised that it might be measured by\r\nsomething else. Happiness mattered as little as pain. They came in,\r\nboth of them, as all the other details of his life came in, to the\r\nelaboration of the design. He seemed for an instant to stand above the\r\naccidents of his existence, and he felt that they could not affect him\r\nagain as they had done before. Whatever happened to him now would be\r\none more motive to add to the complexity of the pattern, and when the\r\nend approached he would rejoice in its completion. It would be a work\r\nof art, and it would be none the less beautiful because he alone knew\r\nof its existence, and with his death it would at once cease to be.\r\n\r\nPhilip was happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sampson, the buyer, took a fancy to Philip. Mr. Sampson was very\r\ndashing, and the girls in his department said they would not be\r\nsurprised if he married one of the rich customers. He lived out of town\r\nand often impressed the assistants by putting on his evening clothes in\r\nthe office. Sometimes he would be seen by those on sweeping duty coming\r\nin next morning still dressed, and they would wink gravely to one\r\nanother while he went into his office and changed into a frock coat. On\r\nthese occasions, having slipped out for a hurried breakfast, he also\r\nwould wink at Philip as he walked up the stairs on his way back and rub\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a night! What a night!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told Philip that he was the only gentleman there, and he and Philip\r\nwere the only fellows who knew what life was. Having said this, he\r\nchanged his manner suddenly, called Philip Mr. Carey instead of old\r\nboy, assumed the importance due to his position as buyer, and put\r\nPhilip back into his place of shop-walker.\r\n\r\nLynn and Sedley received fashion papers from Paris once a week and\r\nadapted the costumes illustrated in them to the needs of their\r\ncustomers. Their clientele was peculiar. The most substantial part\r\nconsisted of women from the smaller manufacturing towns, who were too\r\nelegant to have their frocks made locally and not sufficiently\r\nacquainted with London to discover good dressmakers within their means.\r\nBeside these, incongruously, was a large number of music-hall artistes.\r\nThis was a connection that Mr. Sampson had worked up for himself and\r\ntook great pride in. They had begun by getting their stage-costumes at\r\nLynn\xe2\x80\x99s, and he had induced many of them to get their other clothes\r\nthere as well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs good as Paquin and half the price,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe had a persuasive, hail-fellow well-met air with him which appealed\r\nto customers of this sort, and they said to one another:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of throwing money away when you can get a coat and\r\nskirt at Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s that nobody knows don\xe2\x80\x99t come from Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sampson was very proud of his friendship with the popular\r\nfavourites whose frocks he made, and when he went out to dinner at two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock on Sunday with Miss Victoria Virgo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe was wearing that powder\r\nblue we made her and I lay she didn\xe2\x80\x99t let on it come from us, I \xe2\x80\x99ad to\r\ntell her meself that if I \xe2\x80\x99adn\xe2\x80\x99t designed it with my own \xe2\x80\x99ands I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nsaid it must come from Paquin\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94at her beautiful house in Tulse Hill, he\r\nregaled the department next day with abundant details. Philip had never\r\npaid much attention to women\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, but in course of time he began,\r\na little amused at himself, to take a technical interest in them. He\r\nhad an eye for colour which was more highly trained than that of anyone\r\nin the department, and he had kept from his student days in Paris some\r\nknowledge of line. Mr. Sampson, an ignorant man conscious of his\r\nincompetence, but with a shrewdness that enabled him to combine other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s suggestions, constantly asked the opinion of the assistants in\r\nhis department in making up new designs; and he had the quickness to\r\nsee that Philip\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms were valuable. But he was very jealous,\r\nand would never allow that he took anyone\xe2\x80\x99s advice. When he had altered\r\nsome drawing in accordance with Philip\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, he always finished\r\nup by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it comes round to my own idea in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne day, when Philip had been at the shop for five months, Miss Alice\r\nAntonia, the well-known serio-comic, came in and asked to see Mr.\r\nSampson. She was a large woman, with flaxen hair, and a boldly painted\r\nface, a metallic voice, and the breezy manner of a comedienne\r\naccustomed to be on friendly terms with the gallery boys of provincial\r\nmusic-halls. She had a new song and wished Mr. Sampson to design a\r\ncostume for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want something striking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any old thing you\r\nknow. I want something different from what anybody else has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sampson, bland and familiar, said he was quite certain they could\r\nget her the very thing she required. He showed her sketches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing here that would do, but I just want to show you\r\nthe kind of thing I would suggest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the sort of thing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she glanced\r\nat them impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want is something that\xe2\x80\x99ll just hit \xe2\x80\x99em in\r\nthe jaw and make their front teeth rattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I quite understand, Miss Antonia,\xe2\x80\x9d said the buyer, with a bland\r\nsmile, but his eyes grew blank and stupid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect I shall \xe2\x80\x99ave to pop over to Paris for it in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think we can give you satisfaction, Miss Antonia. What you can\r\nget in Paris you can get here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had swept out of the department Mr. Sampson, a little worried,\r\ndiscussed the matter with Mrs. Hodges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a caution and no mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hodges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice, where art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the buyer, irritably, and thought he\r\nhad scored a point against her.\r\n\r\nHis ideas of music-hall costumes had never gone beyond short skirts, a\r\nswirl of lace, and glittering sequins; but Miss Antonia had expressed\r\nherself on that subject in no uncertain terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd the invocation was uttered in such a tone as to indicate a rooted\r\nantipathy to anything so commonplace, even if she had not added that\r\nsequins gave her the sick. Mr. Sampson \xe2\x80\x98got out\xe2\x80\x99 one or two ideas, but\r\nMrs. Hodges told him frankly she did not think they would do. It was\r\nshe who gave Philip the suggestion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you draw, Phil? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you try your \xe2\x80\x98and and see what you can\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip bought a cheap box of water colours, and in the evening while\r\nBell, the noisy lad of sixteen, whistling three notes, busied himself\r\nwith his stamps, he made one or two sketches. He remembered some of the\r\ncostumes he had seen in Paris, and he adapted one of them, getting his\r\neffect from a combination of violent, unusual colours. The result\r\namused him and next morning he showed it to Mrs. Hodges. She was\r\nsomewhat astonished, but took it at once to the buyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unusual,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt puzzled him, and at the same time his trained eye saw that it would\r\nmake up admirably. To save his face he began making suggestions for\r\naltering it, but Mrs. Hodges, with more sense, advised him to show it\r\nto Miss Antonia as it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s neck or nothing with her, and she may take a fancy to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal more nothing than neck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sampson, looking at\r\nthe decolletage. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can draw, can\xe2\x80\x99t he? Fancy \xe2\x80\x99im keeping it dark all\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Antonia was announced, the buyer placed the design on the\r\ntable in such a position that it must catch her eye the moment she was\r\nshown into his office. She pounced on it at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t I \xe2\x80\x99ave that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just an idea we got out for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sampson casually.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I like it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me \xe2\x80\x99alf a pint with a little drop of\r\ngin in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you see, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to Paris. You\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to say\r\nwhat you want and there you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe work was put in hand at once, and Philip felt quite a thrill of\r\nsatisfaction when he saw the costume completed. The buyer and Mrs.\r\nHodges took all the credit of it; but he did not care, and when he went\r\nwith them to the Tivoli to see Miss Antonia wear it for the first time\r\nhe was filled with elation. In answer to her questions he at last told\r\nMrs. Hodges how he had learnt to draw\xe2\x80\x94fearing that the people he lived\r\nwith would think he wanted to put on airs, he had always taken the\r\ngreatest care to say nothing about his past occupations\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nrepeated the information to Mr. Sampson. The buyer said nothing to him\r\non the subject, but began to treat him a little more deferentially and\r\npresently gave him designs to do for two of the country customers. They\r\nmet with satisfaction. Then he began to speak to his clients of a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cclever young feller, Paris art-student, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d who worked for him;\r\nand soon Philip, ensconced behind a screen, in his shirt sleeves, was\r\ndrawing from morning till night. Sometimes he was so busy that he had\r\nto dine at three with the \xe2\x80\x98stragglers.\xe2\x80\x99 He liked it, because there were\r\nfew of them and they were all too tired to talk; the food also was\r\nbetter, for it consisted of what was left over from the buyers\xe2\x80\x99 table.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s rise from shop-walker to designer of costumes had a great\r\neffect on the department. He realised that he was an object of envy.\r\nHarris, the assistant with the queer-shaped head, who was the first\r\nperson he had known at the shop and had attached himself to Philip,\r\ncould not conceal his bitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people \xe2\x80\x99ave all the luck,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be a buyer yourself\r\none of these days, and we shall all be calling you sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told Philip that he should demand higher wages, for notwithstanding\r\nthe difficult work he was now engaged in, he received no more than the\r\nsix shillings a week with which he started. But it was a ticklish\r\nmatter to ask for a rise. The manager had a sardonic way of dealing\r\nwith such applicants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink you\xe2\x80\x99re worth more, do you? How much d\xe2\x80\x99you think you\xe2\x80\x99re worth,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe assistant, with his heart in his mouth, would suggest that he\r\nthought he ought to have another two shillings a week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well, if you think you\xe2\x80\x99re worth it. You can \xe2\x80\x99ave it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\r\npaused and sometimes, with a steely eye, added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can \xe2\x80\x99ave your\r\nnotice too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no use then to withdraw your request, you had to go. The\r\nmanager\xe2\x80\x99s idea was that assistants who were dissatisfied did not work\r\nproperly, and if they were not worth a rise it was better to sack them\r\nat once. The result was that they never asked for one unless they were\r\nprepared to leave. Philip hesitated. He was a little suspicious of the\r\nmen in his room who told him that the buyer could not do without him.\r\nThey were decent fellows, but their sense of humour was primitive, and\r\nit would have seemed funny to them if they had persuaded Philip to ask\r\nfor more wages and he were sacked. He could not forget the\r\nmortification he had suffered in looking for work, he did not wish to\r\nexpose himself to that again, and he knew there was small chance of his\r\ngetting elsewhere a post as designer: there were hundreds of people\r\nabout who could draw as well as he. But he wanted money very badly; his\r\nclothes were worn out, and the heavy carpets rotted his socks and\r\nboots; he had almost persuaded himself to take the venturesome step\r\nwhen one morning, passing up from breakfast in the basement through the\r\npassage that led to the manager\xe2\x80\x99s office, he saw a queue of men waiting\r\nin answer to an advertisement. There were about a hundred of them, and\r\nwhichever was engaged would be offered his keep and the same six\r\nshillings a week that Philip had. He saw some of them cast envious\r\nglances at him because he had employment. It made him shudder. He dared\r\nnot risk it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter passed. Now and then Philip went to the hospital, slinking\r\nin when it was late and there was little chance of meeting anyone he\r\nknew, to see whether there were letters for him. At Easter he received\r\none from his uncle. He was surprised to hear from him, for the Vicar of\r\nBlackstable had never written him more than half a dozen letters in his\r\nwhole life, and they were on business matters.\r\n\r\nDear Philip,\r\n\r\nIf you are thinking of taking a holiday soon and care to come down here\r\nI shall be pleased to see you. I was very ill with my bronchitis in the\r\nwinter and Doctor Wigram never expected me to pull through. I have a\r\nwonderful constitution and I made, thank God, a marvellous recovery.\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nWilliam Carey.\r\n\r\nThe letter made Philip angry. How did his uncle think he was living? He\r\ndid not even trouble to inquire. He might have starved for all the old\r\nman cared. But as he walked home something struck him; he stopped under\r\na lamp-post and read the letter again; the handwriting had no longer\r\nthe business-like firmness which had characterised it; it was larger\r\nand wavering: perhaps the illness had shaken him more than he was\r\nwilling to confess, and he sought in that formal note to express a\r\nyearning to see the only relation he had in the world. Philip wrote\r\nback that he could come down to Blackstable for a fortnight in July.\r\nThe invitation was convenient, for he had not known what to do, with\r\nhis brief holiday. The Athelnys went hopping in September, but he could\r\nnot then be spared, since during that month the autumn models were\r\nprepared. The rule of Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s was that everyone must take a fortnight\r\nwhether he wanted it or not; and during that time, if he had nowhere to\r\ngo, the assistant might sleep in his room, but he was not allowed food.\r\nA number had no friends within reasonable distance of London, and to\r\nthese the holiday was an awkward interval when they had to provide food\r\nout of their small wages and, with the whole day on their hands, had\r\nnothing to spend. Philip had not been out of London since his visit to\r\nBrighton with Mildred, now two years before, and he longed for fresh\r\nair and the silence of the sea. He thought of it with such a passionate\r\ndesire, all through May and June, that, when at length the time came\r\nfor him to go, he was listless.\r\n\r\nOn his last evening, when he talked with the buyer of one or two jobs\r\nhe had to leave over, Mr. Sampson suddenly said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat wages have you been getting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix shillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s enough. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you\xe2\x80\x99re put up to twelve when\r\nyou come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to want some new\r\nclothes badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you stick to your work and don\xe2\x80\x99t go larking about with the girls\r\nlike what some of them do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look after you, Carey. Mind you, you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a lot to learn, but you\xe2\x80\x99re promising, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that for you, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\npromising, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you get a pound a week as soon as you\r\ndeserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip wondered how long he would have to wait for that. Two years?\r\n\r\nHe was startled at the change in his uncle. When last he had seen him\r\nhe was a stout man, who held himself upright, clean-shaven, with a\r\nround, sensual face; but he had fallen in strangely, his skin was\r\nyellow; there were great bags under the eyes, and he was bent and old.\r\nHe had grown a beard during his last illness, and he walked very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not at my best today,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when Philip, having just arrived,\r\nwas sitting with him in the dining-room. \xe2\x80\x9cThe heat upsets me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip, asking after the affairs of the parish, looked at him and\r\nwondered how much longer he could last. A hot summer would finish him;\r\nPhilip noticed how thin his hands were; they trembled. It meant so much\r\nto Philip. If he died that summer he could go back to the hospital at\r\nthe beginning of the winter session; his heart leaped at the thought of\r\nreturning no more to Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s. At dinner the Vicar sat humped up on his\r\nchair, and the housekeeper who had been with him since his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall Mr. Philip carve, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man, who had been about to do so from disinclination to confess\r\nhis weakness, seemed glad at the first suggestion to relinquish the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very good appetite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I always eat well. But I\xe2\x80\x99m thinner than when you were here\r\nlast. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to be thinner, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like being so fat. Dr. Wigram\r\nthinks I\xe2\x80\x99m all the better for being thinner than I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over the housekeeper brought him some medicine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow the prescription to Master Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor too.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like him to see that he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I told Dr. Wigram\r\nthat now you\xe2\x80\x99re studying to be a doctor he ought to make a reduction in\r\nhis charges. It\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful the bills I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to pay. He came every day\r\nfor two months, and he charges five shillings a visit. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of\r\nmoney, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? He comes twice a week still. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell him he\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t come any more. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for him if I want him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at Philip eagerly while he read the prescriptions. They were\r\nnarcotics. There were two of them, and one was a medicine which the\r\nVicar explained he was to use only if his neuritis grew unendurable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very careful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the opium\r\nhabit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not mention his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. Philip fancied that it was by\r\nway of precaution, in case he asked for money, that his uncle kept\r\ndwelling on the financial calls upon him. He had spent so much on the\r\ndoctor and so much more on the chemist, while he was ill they had had\r\nto have a fire every day in his bed-room, and now on Sunday he needed a\r\ncarriage to go to church in the evening as well as in the morning.\r\nPhilip felt angrily inclined to say he need not be afraid, he was not\r\ngoing to borrow from him, but he held his tongue. It seemed to him that\r\neverything had left the old man now but two things, pleasure in his\r\nfood and a grasping desire for money. It was a hideous old age.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Dr. Wigram came, and after the visit Philip walked\r\nwith him to the garden gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you think he is?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nDr. Wigram was more anxious not to do wrong than to do right, and he\r\nnever hazarded a definite opinion if he could help it. He had practised\r\nat Blackstable for five-and-thirty years. He had the reputation of\r\nbeing very safe, and many of his patients thought it much better that a\r\ndoctor should be safe than clever. There was a new man at\r\nBlackstable\xe2\x80\x94he had been settled there for ten years, but they still\r\nlooked upon him as an interloper\xe2\x80\x94and he was said to be very clever; but\r\nhe had not much practice among the better people, because no one really\r\nknew anything about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s as well as can be expected,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Wigram in answer to\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he got anything seriously the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Philip, your uncle is no longer a young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor\r\nwith a cautious little smile, which suggested that after all the Vicar\r\nof Blackstable was not an old man either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to think his heart\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not satisfied with his heart,\xe2\x80\x9d hazarded the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he\r\nshould be careful, very careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the tip of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s tongue was the question: how much longer can he\r\nlive? He was afraid it would shock. In these matters a periphrase was\r\ndemanded by the decorum of life, but, as he asked another question\r\ninstead, it flashed through him that the doctor must be accustomed to\r\nthe impatience of a sick man\xe2\x80\x99s relatives. He must see through their\r\nsympathetic expressions. Philip, with a faint smile at his own\r\nhypocrisy, cast down his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s in no immediate danger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the kind of question the doctor hated. If you said a patient\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live another month the family prepared itself for a\r\nbereavement, and if then the patient lived on they visited the medical\r\nattendant with the resentment they felt at having tormented themselves\r\nbefore it was necessary. On the other hand, if you said the patient\r\nmight live a year and he died in a week the family said you did not\r\nknow your business. They thought of all the affection they would have\r\nlavished on the defunct if they had known the end was so near. Dr.\r\nWigram made the gesture of washing his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any grave risk so long as he\xe2\x80\x94remains as he is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe ventured at last. \xe2\x80\x9cBut on the other hand, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s no longer a young man, and well, the machine is wearing out. If he\r\ngets over the hot weather I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on very\r\ncomfortably till the winter, and then if the winter does not bother him\r\ntoo much, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why anything should happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip went back to the dining-room where his uncle was sitting. With\r\nhis skull-cap and a crochet shawl over his shoulders he looked\r\ngrotesque. His eyes had been fixed on the door, and they rested on\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s face as he entered. Philip saw that his uncle had been waiting\r\nanxiously for his return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did he say about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip understood suddenly that the old man was frightened of dying. It\r\nmade Philip a little ashamed, so that he looked away involuntarily. He\r\nwas always embarrassed by the weakness of human nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he thinks you\xe2\x80\x99re much better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nA gleam of delight came into his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wonderful constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat else did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added suspiciously.\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said that if you take care of yourself there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why you\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live to be a hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can expect to do that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see eighty. My mother lived till she was eighty-four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little table by the side of Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and on it\r\nwere a Bible and the large volume of the Common Prayer from which for\r\nso many years he had been accustomed to read to his household. He\r\nstretched out now his shaking hand and took his Bible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose old patriarchs lived to a jolly good old age, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, with a queer little laugh in which Philip read a sort of timid\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThe old man clung to life. Yet he believed implicitly all that his\r\nreligion taught him. He had no doubt in the immortality of the soul,\r\nand he felt that he had conducted himself well enough, according to his\r\ncapacities, to make it very likely that he would go to heaven. In his\r\nlong career to how many dying persons must he have administered the\r\nconsolations of religion! Perhaps he was like the doctor who could get\r\nno benefit from his own prescriptions. Philip was puzzled and shocked\r\nby that eager cleaving to the earth. He wondered what nameless horror\r\nwas at the back of the old man\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He would have liked to probe\r\ninto his soul so that he might see in its nakedness the dreadful dismay\r\nof the unknown which he suspected.\r\n\r\nThe fortnight passed quickly and Philip returned to London. He passed a\r\nsweltering August behind his screen in the costumes department, drawing\r\nin his shirt sleeves. The assistants in relays went for their holidays.\r\nIn the evening Philip generally went into Hyde Park and listened to the\r\nband. Growing more accustomed to his work it tired him less, and his\r\nmind, recovering from its long stagnation, sought for fresh activity.\r\nHis whole desire now was set on his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s death. He kept on dreaming\r\nthe same dream: a telegram was handed to him one morning, early, which\r\nannounced the Vicar\xe2\x80\x99s sudden demise, and freedom was in his grasp. When\r\nhe awoke and found it was nothing but a dream he was filled with sombre\r\nrage. He occupied himself, now that the event seemed likely to happen\r\nat any time, with elaborate plans for the future. In these he passed\r\nrapidly over the year which he must spend before it was possible for\r\nhim to be qualified and dwelt on the journey to Spain on which his\r\nheart was set. He read books about that country, which he borrowed from\r\nthe free library, and already he knew from photographs exactly what\r\neach city looked like. He saw himself lingering in Cordova on the\r\nbridge that spanned the Gaudalquivir; he wandered through tortuous\r\nstreets in Toledo and sat in churches where he wrung from El Greco the\r\nsecret which he felt the mysterious painter held for him. Athelny\r\nentered into his humour, and on Sunday afternoons they made out\r\nelaborate itineraries so that Philip should miss nothing that was\r\nnoteworthy. To cheat his impatience Philip began to teach himself\r\nSpanish, and in the deserted sitting-room in Harrington Street he spent\r\nan hour every evening doing Spanish exercises and puzzling out with an\r\nEnglish translation by his side the magnificent phrases of Don Quixote.\r\nAthelny gave him a lesson once a week, and Philip learned a few\r\nsentences to help him on his journey. Mrs. Athelny laughed at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou two and your Spanish!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you do something\r\nuseful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sally, who was growing up and was to put up her hair at Christmas,\r\nstood by sometimes and listened in her grave way while her father and\r\nPhilip exchanged remarks in a language she did not understand. She\r\nthought her father the most wonderful man who had ever existed, and she\r\nexpressed her opinion of Philip only through her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommendations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather thinks a rare lot of your Uncle Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked to her\r\nbrothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nThorpe, the eldest boy, was old enough to go on the Arethusa, and\r\nAthelny regaled his family with magnificent descriptions of the\r\nappearance the lad would make when he came back in uniform for his\r\nholidays. As soon as Sally was seventeen she was to be apprenticed to a\r\ndressmaker. Athelny in his rhetorical way talked of the birds, strong\r\nenough to fly now, who were leaving the parental nest, and with tears\r\nin his eyes told them that the nest would be there still if ever they\r\nwished to return to it. A shakedown and a dinner would always be\r\ntheirs, and the heart of a father would never be closed to the troubles\r\nof his children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do talk, Athelny,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what trouble\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re likely to get into so long as they\xe2\x80\x99re steady. So long as you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhonest and not afraid of work you\xe2\x80\x99ll never be out of a job, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI think, and I can tell you I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be sorry when I see the last of\r\nthem earning their own living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChild-bearing, hard work, and constant anxiety were beginning to tell\r\non Mrs. Athelny; and sometimes her back ached in the evening so that\r\nshe had to sit down and rest herself. Her ideal of happiness was to\r\nhave a girl to do the rough work so that she need not herself get up\r\nbefore seven. Athelny waved his beautiful white hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my Betty, we\xe2\x80\x99ve deserved well of the state, you and I. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nreared nine healthy children, and the boys shall serve their king; the\r\ngirls shall cook and sew and in their turn breed healthy children.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nturned to Sally, and to comfort her for the anti-climax of the contrast\r\nadded grandiloquently: \xe2\x80\x9cThey also serve who only stand and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthelny had lately added socialism to the other contradictory theories\r\nhe vehemently believed in, and he stated now:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a socialist state we should be richly pensioned, you and I, Betty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me about your socialists, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no patience with\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt only means that another lot of lazy loafers will\r\nmake a good thing out of the working classes. My motto is, leave me\r\nalone; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone interfering with me; I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the best of a\r\nbad job, and the devil take the hindmost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you call life a bad job?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cNever! We\xe2\x80\x99ve had our ups\r\nand downs, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had our struggles, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been poor, but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen worth it, ay, worth it a hundred times I say when I look round at\r\nmy children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do talk, Athelny,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at him, not with anger but\r\nwith scornful calm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had the pleasant part of the children, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad the bearing of them, and the bearing with them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not fond of them, now they\xe2\x80\x99re there, but if I had my time over\r\nagain I\xe2\x80\x99d remain single. Why, if I\xe2\x80\x99d remained single I might have a\r\nlittle shop by now, and four or five hundred pounds in the bank, and a\r\ngirl to do the rough work. Oh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go over my life again, not\r\nfor something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thought of the countless millions to whom life is no more than\r\nunending labour, neither beautiful nor ugly, but just to be accepted in\r\nthe same spirit as one accepts the changes of the seasons. Fury seized\r\nhim because it all seemed useless. He could not reconcile himself to\r\nthe belief that life had no meaning and yet everything he saw, all his\r\nthoughts, added to the force of his conviction. But though fury seized\r\nhim it was a joyful fury. Life was not so horrible if it was\r\nmeaningless, and he faced it with a strange sense of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe autumn passed into winter. Philip had left his address with Mrs.\r\nFoster, his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper, so that she might communicate with\r\nhim, but still went once a week to the hospital on the chance of there\r\nbeing a letter. One evening he saw his name on an envelope in a\r\nhandwriting he had hoped never to see again. It gave him a queer\r\nfeeling. For a little while he could not bring himself to take it. It\r\nbrought back a host of hateful memories. But at length, impatient with\r\nhimself, he ripped open the envelope.\r\n\r\n7 William Street, Fitzroy Square.\r\n\r\nDear Phil,\r\n\r\nCan I see you for a minute or two as soon as possible. I am in awful\r\ntrouble and don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s not money.\r\n\r\n                                                 Yours truly,\r\n                                                         Mildred.\r\n\r\nHe tore the letter into little bits and going out into the street\r\nscattered them in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see her damned,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nA feeling of disgust surged up in him at the thought of seeing her\r\nagain. He did not care if she was in distress, it served her right\r\nwhatever it was, he thought of her with hatred, and the love he had had\r\nfor her aroused his loathing. His recollections filled him with nausea,\r\nand as he walked across the Thames he drew himself aside in an\r\ninstinctive withdrawal from his thought of her. He went to bed, but he\r\ncould not sleep; he wondered what was the matter with her, and he could\r\nnot get out of his head the fear that she was ill and hungry; she would\r\nnot have written to him unless she were desperate. He was angry with\r\nhimself for his weakness, but he knew that he would have no peace\r\nunless he saw her. Next morning he wrote a letter-card and posted it on\r\nhis way to the shop. He made it as stiff as he could and said merely\r\nthat he was sorry she was in difficulties and would come to the address\r\nshe had given at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening.\r\n\r\nIt was that of a shabby lodging-house in a sordid street; and when,\r\nsick at the thought of seeing her, he asked whether she was in, a wild\r\nhope seized him that she had left. It looked the sort of place people\r\nmoved in and out of frequently. He had not thought of looking at the\r\npostmark on her letter and did not know how many days it had lain in\r\nthe rack. The woman who answered the bell did not reply to his inquiry,\r\nbut silently preceded him along the passage and knocked on a door at\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Miller, a gentleman to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she called.\r\n\r\nThe door was slightly opened, and Mildred looked out suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked in and she closed the door. It was a very small bed-room,\r\nuntidy as was every place she lived in; there was a pair of shoes on\r\nthe floor, lying apart from one another and uncleaned; a hat was on the\r\nchest of drawers, with false curls beside it; and there was a blouse on\r\nthe table. Philip looked for somewhere to put his hat. The hooks behind\r\nthe door were laden with skirts, and he noticed that they were muddy at\r\nthe hem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Then she gave a little awkward laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you were surprised to hear from me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re awfully hoarse,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got a sore throat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have had for some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not say anything. He waited for her to explain why she wanted to\r\nsee him. The look of the room told him clearly enough that she had gone\r\nback to the life from which he had taken her. He wondered what had\r\nhappened to the baby; there was a photograph of it on the\r\nchimney-piece, but no sign in the room that a child was ever there.\r\nMildred was holding her handkerchief. She made it into a little ball,\r\nand passed it from hand to hand. He saw that she was very nervous. She\r\nwas staring at the fire, and he could look at her without meeting her\r\neyes. She was much thinner than when she had left him; and the skin,\r\nyellow and dryish, was drawn more tightly over her cheekbones. She had\r\ndyed her hair and it was now flaxen: it altered her a good deal, and\r\nmade her look more vulgar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was relieved to get your letter, I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought p\xe2\x80\x99raps you weren\xe2\x80\x99t at the \xe2\x80\x99ospital any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re qualified by now, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no longer at the hospital. I had to give it up eighteen months\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are changeable. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem as if you could stick to anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent for another moment, and when he went on it was with\r\ncoldness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lost the little money I had in an unlucky speculation and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafford to go on with the medical. I had to earn my living as best I\r\ncould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a quick glance and turned her eyes away at once. He\r\nthought that she reddened. She dabbed her palms nervously with the\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve not forgotten all your doctoring, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d She jerked the\r\nwords out quite oddly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause that\xe2\x80\x99s why I wanted to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice sank to a hoarse\r\nwhisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go to a hospital?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to do that, and have all the stoodents staring at me, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid they\xe2\x80\x99d want to keep me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you complaining of?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip coldly, with the\r\nstereotyped phrase used in the out-patients\xe2\x80\x99 room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come out in a rash, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip felt a twinge of horror in his heart. Sweat broke out on his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me look at your throat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her over to the window and made such examination as he could.\r\nSuddenly he caught sight of her eyes. There was deadly fear in them. It\r\nwas horrible to see. She was terrified. She wanted him to reassure her;\r\nshe looked at him pleadingly, not daring to ask for words of comfort\r\nbut with all her nerves astrung to receive them: he had none to offer\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re very ill indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you think it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he told her she grew deathly pale, and her lips even turned,\r\nyellow. she began to cry, hopelessly, quietly at first and then with\r\nchoking sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I had to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may just as well kill myself and have done with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took no notice of the threat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got any money?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix or seven pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must give up this life, you know. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you could find\r\nsome work to do? I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you much. I only get twelve\r\nbob a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there I can do now?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all, you MUST try to get something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her very gravely, telling her of her own danger and the\r\ndanger to which she exposed others, and she listened sullenly. He tried\r\nto console her. At last he brought her to a sulky acquiescence in which\r\nshe promised to do all he advised. He wrote a prescription, which he\r\nsaid he would leave at the nearest chemist\xe2\x80\x99s, and he impressed upon her\r\nthe necessity of taking her medicine with the utmost regularity.\r\nGetting up to go, he held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be downhearted, you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get over your throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as he went her face became suddenly distorted, and she caught hold\r\nof his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so afraid, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nme alone yet. Phil, please. There\xe2\x80\x99s no one else I can go to, you\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nonly friend I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt the terror of her soul, and it was strangely like that terror\r\nhe had seen in his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when he feared that he might die.\r\nPhilip looked down. Twice that woman had come into his life and made\r\nhim wretched; she had no claim upon him; and yet, he knew not why, deep\r\nin his heart was a strange aching; it was that which, when he received\r\nher letter, had left him no peace till he obeyed her summons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I shall never really quite get over it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\nWhat perplexed him was that he felt a curious physical distaste, which\r\nmade it uncomfortable for him to be near her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go out and dine together. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. He felt that she was creeping back again into his life\r\nwhen he thought she was gone out of it for ever. She watched him with\r\nsickening anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve treated you shocking, but don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me alone now.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had your revenge. If you leave me by myself now I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat I shall do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we shall have to do it on the\r\ncheap, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got money to throw away these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down and put her shoes on, then changed her skirt and put on a\r\nhat; and they walked out together till they found a restaurant in the\r\nTottenham Court Road. Philip had got out of the habit of eating at\r\nthose hours, and Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s throat was so sore that she could not\r\nswallow. They had a little cold ham and Philip drank a glass of beer.\r\nThey sat opposite one another, as they had so often sat before; he\r\nwondered if she remembered; they had nothing to say to one another and\r\nwould have sat in silence if Philip had not forced himself to talk. In\r\nthe bright light of the restaurant, with its vulgar looking-glasses\r\nthat reflected in an endless series, she looked old and haggard. Philip\r\nwas anxious to know about the child, but he had not the courage to ask.\r\nAt last she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know baby died last summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might say you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him and, understanding what he meant, looked away\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were rare stuck on it at one time, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you? I always thought\r\nit funny like how you could see so much in another man\xe2\x80\x99s child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished eating they called at the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s for the\r\nmedicine Philip had ordered, and going back to the shabby room he made\r\nher take a dose. Then they sat together till it was time for Philip to\r\ngo back to Harrington Street. He was hideously bored.\r\n\r\nPhilip went to see her every day. She took the medicine he had\r\nprescribed and followed his directions, and soon the results were so\r\napparent that she gained the greatest confidence in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s skill. As\r\nshe grew better she grew less despondent. She talked more freely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I can get a job I shall be all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nmy lesson now and I mean to profit by it. No more racketing about for\r\nyours truly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach time he saw her, Philip asked whether she had found work. She told\r\nhim not to worry, she would find something to do as soon as she wanted\r\nit; she had several strings to her bow; it was all the better not to do\r\nanything for a week or two. He could not deny this, but at the end of\r\nthat time he became more insistent. She laughed at him, she was much\r\nmore cheerful now, and said he was a fussy old thing. She told him long\r\nstories of the manageresses she interviewed, for her idea was to get\r\nwork at some eating-house; what they said and what she answered.\r\nNothing definite was fixed, but she was sure to settle something at the\r\nbeginning of the following week: there was no use hurrying, and it\r\nwould be a mistake to take something unsuitable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s absurd to talk like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must take\r\nanything you can get. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you, and your money won\xe2\x80\x99t last for\r\never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not come to the end of it yet and chance it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her sharply. It was three weeks since his first visit, and\r\nshe had then less than seven pounds. Suspicion seized him. He\r\nremembered some of the things she had said. He put two and two\r\ntogether. He wondered whether she had made any attempt to find work.\r\nPerhaps she had been lying to him all the time. It was very strange\r\nthat her money should have lasted so long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your rent here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s very nice, different from what some of them are;\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s quite willing to wait till it\xe2\x80\x99s convenient for me to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent. What he suspected was so horrible that he hesitated. It\r\nwas no use to ask her, she would deny everything; if he wanted to know\r\nhe must find out for himself. He was in the habit of leaving her every\r\nevening at eight, and when the clock struck he got up; but instead of\r\ngoing back to Harrington Street he stationed himself at the corner of\r\nFitzroy Square so that he could see anyone who came along William\r\nStreet. It seemed to him that he waited an interminable time, and he\r\nwas on the point of going away, thinking his surmise had been mistaken,\r\nwhen the door of No. 7 opened and Mildred came out. He fell back into\r\nthe darkness and watched her walk towards him. She had on the hat with\r\na quantity of feathers on it which he had seen in her room, and she\r\nwore a dress he recognized, too showy for the street and unsuitable to\r\nthe time of year. He followed her slowly till she came into the\r\nTottenham Court Road, where she slackened her pace; at the corner of\r\nOxford Street she stopped, looked round, and crossed over to a\r\nmusic-hall. He went up to her and touched her on the arm. He saw that\r\nshe had rouged her cheeks and painted her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, Mildred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started at the sound of his voice and reddened as she always did\r\nwhen she was caught in a lie; then the flash of anger which he knew so\r\nwell came into her eyes as she instinctively sought to defend herself\r\nby abuse. But she did not say the words which were on the tip of her\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I was only going to see the show. It gives me the hump sitting\r\nevery night by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not pretend to believe her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t. Good heavens, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you fifty times how dangerous it\r\nis. You must stop this sort of thing at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hold your jaw,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried roughly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\nlive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took hold of her arm and without thinking what he was doing tried to\r\ndrag her away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake come along. Let me take you home. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care? Let them take their chance. Men haven\xe2\x80\x99t been so good\r\nto me that I need bother my head about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pushed him away and walking up to the box-office put down her\r\nmoney. Philip had threepence in his pocket. He could not follow. He\r\nturned away and walked slowly down Oxford Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThat was the end. He did not see her again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCX\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas that year falling on Thursday, the shop was to close for four\r\ndays: Philip wrote to his uncle asking whether it would be convenient\r\nfor him to spend the holidays at the vicarage. He received an answer\r\nfrom Mrs. Foster, saying that Mr. Carey was not well enough to write\r\nhimself, but wished to see his nephew and would be glad if he came\r\ndown. She met Philip at the door, and when she shook hands with him,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find him changed since you was here last, sir; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npretend you don\xe2\x80\x99t notice anything, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, sir? He\xe2\x80\x99s that nervous\r\nabout himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip nodded, and she led him into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Philip, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Vicar of Blackstable was a dying man. There was no mistaking that\r\nwhen you looked at the hollow cheeks and the shrunken body. He sat\r\nhuddled in the arm-chair, with his head strangely thrown back, and a\r\nshawl over his shoulders. He could not walk now without the help of\r\nsticks, and his hands trembled so that he could only feed himself with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t last long now,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Philip, as he looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you think I\xe2\x80\x99m looking?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Vicar. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nchanged since you were here last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you look stronger than you did last summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the heat. That always upsets me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s history of the last few months consisted in the number of\r\nweeks he had spent in his bed-room and the number of weeks he had spent\r\ndownstairs. He had a hand-bell by his side and while he talked he rang\r\nit for Mrs. Foster, who sat in the next room ready to attend to his\r\nwants, to ask on what day of the month he had first left his room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the seventh of November, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carey looked at Philip to see how he took the information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I eat well still, don\xe2\x80\x99t I, Mrs. Foster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wonderful appetite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to put on flesh though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing interested him now but his health. He was set upon one thing\r\nindomitably and that was living, just living, notwithstanding the\r\nmonotony of his life and the constant pain which allowed him to sleep\r\nonly when he was under the influence of morphia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s terrible, the amount of money I have to spend on doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe tinkled his bell again. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Foster, show Master Philip the\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatiently she took it off the chimney-piece and handed it to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s only one month. I was wondering if as you\xe2\x80\x99re doctoring yourself\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get me the drugs cheaper. I thought of getting them down\r\nfrom the stores, but then there\xe2\x80\x99s the postage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough apparently taking so little interest in him that he did not\r\ntrouble to inquire what Phil was doing, he seemed glad to have him\r\nthere. He asked how long he could stay, and when Philip told him he\r\nmust leave on Tuesday morning, expressed a wish that the visit might\r\nhave been longer. He told him minutely all his symptoms and repeated\r\nwhat the doctor had said of him. He broke off to ring his bell, and\r\nwhen Mrs. Foster came in, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if you were there. I only rang to see if you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone he explained to Philip that it made him uneasy if he\r\nwas not certain that Mrs. Foster was within earshot; she knew exactly\r\nwhat to do with him if anything happened. Philip, seeing that she was\r\ntired and that her eyes were heavy from want of sleep, suggested that\r\nhe was working her too hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicar, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s as strong as a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d And when\r\nnext she came in to give him his medicine he said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Philip says you\xe2\x80\x99ve got too much to do, Mrs. Foster. You like\r\nlooking after me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, sir. I want to do everything I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently the medicine took effect and Mr. Carey fell asleep. Philip\r\nwent into the kitchen and asked Mrs. Foster whether she could stand the\r\nwork. He saw that for some months she had had little peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, what can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ndependent on me, and, although he is troublesome sometimes, you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp liking him, can you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here so many years now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what I shall do when he comes to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip saw that she was really fond of the old man. She washed and\r\ndressed him, gave him his food, and was up half a dozen times in the\r\nnight; for she slept in the next room to his and whenever he awoke he\r\ntinkled his little bell till she came in. He might die at any moment,\r\nbut he might live for months. It was wonderful that she should look\r\nafter a stranger with such patient tenderness, and it was tragic and\r\npitiful that she should be alone in the world to care for him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Philip that the religion which his uncle had preached all\r\nhis life was now of no more than formal importance to him: every Sunday\r\nthe curate came and administered to him Holy Communion, and he often\r\nread his Bible; but it was clear that he looked upon death with horror.\r\nHe believed that it was the gateway to life everlasting, but he did not\r\nwant to enter upon that life. In constant pain, chained to his chair\r\nand having given up the hope of ever getting out into the open again,\r\nlike a child in the hands of a woman to whom he paid wages, he clung to\r\nthe world he knew.\r\n\r\nIn Philip\xe2\x80\x99s head was a question he could not ask, because he was aware\r\nthat his uncle would never give any but a conventional answer: he\r\nwondered whether at the very end, now that the machine was painfully\r\nwearing itself out, the clergyman still believed in immortality;\r\nperhaps at the bottom of his soul, not allowed to shape itself into\r\nwords in case it became urgent, was the conviction that there was no\r\nGod and after this life nothing.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Boxing Day Philip sat in the dining-room with his\r\nuncle. He had to start very early next morning in order to get to the\r\nshop by nine, and he was to say good-night to Mr. Carey then. The Vicar\r\nof Blackstable was dozing and Philip, lying on the sofa by the window,\r\nlet his book fall on his knees and looked idly round the room. He asked\r\nhimself how much the furniture would fetch. He had walked round the\r\nhouse and looked at the things he had known from his childhood; there\r\nwere a few pieces of china which might go for a decent price and Philip\r\nwondered if it would be worth while to take them up to London; but the\r\nfurniture was of the Victorian order, of mahogany, solid and ugly; it\r\nwould go for nothing at an auction. There were three or four thousand\r\nbooks, but everyone knew how badly they sold, and it was not probable\r\nthat they would fetch more than a hundred pounds. Philip did not know\r\nhow much his uncle would leave, and he reckoned out for the hundredth\r\ntime what was the least sum upon which he could finish the curriculum\r\nat the hospital, take his degree, and live during the time he wished to\r\nspend on hospital appointments. He looked at the old man, sleeping\r\nrestlessly: there was no humanity left in that shrivelled face; it was\r\nthe face of some queer animal. Philip thought how easy it would be to\r\nfinish that useless life. He had thought it each evening when Mrs.\r\nFoster prepared for his uncle the medicine which was to give him an\r\neasy night. There were two bottles: one contained a drug which he took\r\nregularly, and the other an opiate if the pain grew unendurable. This\r\nwas poured out for him and left by his bed-side. He generally took it\r\nat three or four in the morning. It would be a simple thing to double\r\nthe dose; he would die in the night, and no one would suspect anything;\r\nfor that was how Doctor Wigram expected him to die. The end would be\r\npainless. Philip clenched his hands as he thought of the money he\r\nwanted so badly. A few more months of that wretched life could matter\r\nnothing to the old man, but the few more months meant everything to\r\nhim: he was getting to the end of his endurance, and when he thought of\r\ngoing back to work in the morning he shuddered with horror. His heart\r\nbeat quickly at the thought which obsessed him, and though he made an\r\neffort to put it out of his mind he could not. It would be so easy, so\r\ndesperately easy. He had no feeling for the old man, he had never liked\r\nhim; he had been selfish all his life, selfish to his wife who adored\r\nhim, indifferent to the boy who had been put in his charge; he was not\r\na cruel man, but a stupid, hard man, eaten up with a small sensuality.\r\nIt would be easy, desperately easy. Philip did not dare. He was afraid\r\nof remorse; it would be no good having the money if he regretted all\r\nhis life what he had done. Though he had told himself so often that\r\nregret was futile, there were certain things that came back to him\r\noccasionally and worried him. He wished they were not on his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nHis uncle opened his eyes; Philip was glad, for he looked a little more\r\nhuman then. He was frankly horrified at the idea that had come to him,\r\nit was murder that he was meditating; and he wondered if other people\r\nhad such thoughts or whether he was abnormal and depraved. He supposed\r\nhe could not have done it when it came to the point, but there the\r\nthought was, constantly recurring: if he held his hand it was from\r\nfear. His uncle spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not looking forward to my death, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip felt his heart\r\nbeat against his chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like you to do that. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get a\r\nlittle bit of money when I pass away, but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t look forward to\r\nit. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t profit you if you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a low voice, and there was a curious anxiety in his tone.\r\nIt sent a pang into Philip\xe2\x80\x99s heart. He wondered what strange insight\r\nmight have led the old man to surmise what strange desires were in\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll live for another twenty years,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to do that, but if I take care of myself I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t last another three or four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a while, and Philip found nothing to say. Then, as if\r\nhe had been thinking it all over, the old man spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has the right to live as long as he can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip wanted to distract his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I suppose you never hear from Miss Wilkinson now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had a letter some time this year. She\xe2\x80\x99s married, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she married a widower. I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re quite comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXI\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day Philip began work again, but the end which he expected within\r\na few weeks did not come. The weeks passed into months. The winter wore\r\naway, and in the parks the trees burst into bud and into leaf. A\r\nterrible lassitude settled upon Philip. Time was passing, though it\r\nwent with such heavy feet, and he thought that his youth was going and\r\nsoon he would have lost it and nothing would have been accomplished.\r\nHis work seemed more aimless now that there was the certainty of his\r\nleaving it. He became skilful in the designing of costumes, and though\r\nhe had no inventive faculty acquired quickness in the adaptation of\r\nFrench fashions to the English market. Sometimes he was not displeased\r\nwith his drawings, but they always bungled them in the execution. He\r\nwas amused to notice that he suffered from a lively irritation when his\r\nideas were not adequately carried out. He had to walk warily. Whenever\r\nhe suggested something original Mr. Sampson turned it down: their\r\ncustomers did not want anything outre, it was a very respectable class\r\nof business, and when you had a connection of that sort it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth\r\nwhile taking liberties with it. Once or twice he spoke sharply to\r\nPhilip; he thought the young man was getting a bit above himself,\r\nbecause Philip\xe2\x80\x99s ideas did not always coincide with his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jolly well take care, my fine young fellow, or one of these days\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find yourself in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip longed to give him a punch on the nose, but he restrained\r\nhimself. After all it could not possibly last much longer, and then he\r\nwould be done with all these people for ever. Sometimes in comic\r\ndesperation he cried out that his uncle must be made of iron. What a\r\nconstitution! The ills he suffered from would have killed any decent\r\nperson twelve months before. When at last the news came that the Vicar\r\nwas dying Philip, who had been thinking of other things, was taken by\r\nsurprise. It was in July, and in another fortnight he was to have gone\r\nfor his holiday. He received a letter from Mrs. Foster to say the\r\ndoctor did not give Mr. Carey many days to live, and if Philip wished\r\nto see him again he must come at once. Philip went to the buyer and\r\ntold him he wanted to leave. Mr. Sampson was a decent fellow, and when\r\nhe knew the circumstances made no difficulties. Philip said good-bye to\r\nthe people in his department; the reason of his leaving had spread\r\namong them in an exaggerated form, and they thought he had come into a\r\nfortune. Mrs. Hodges had tears in her eyes when she shook hands with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we shan\xe2\x80\x99t often see you again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to get away from Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nIt was strange, but he was actually sorry to leave these people whom he\r\nthought he had loathed, and when he drove away from the house in\r\nHarrington Street it was with no exultation. He had so anticipated the\r\nemotions he would experience on this occasion that now he felt nothing:\r\nhe was as unconcerned as though he were going for a few days\xe2\x80\x99 holiday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a rotten nature,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to\r\nthings awfully, and then when they come I\xe2\x80\x99m always disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reached Blackstable early in the afternoon. Mrs. Foster met him at\r\nthe door, and her face told him that his uncle was not yet dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a little better today,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got a wonderful\r\nconstitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led him into the bed-room where Mr. Carey lay on his back. He gave\r\nPhilip a slight smile, in which was a trace of satisfied cunning at\r\nhaving circumvented his enemy once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was all up with me yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an exhausted\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d all given me up, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mrs. Foster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wonderful constitution, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s life in the old dog yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Foster said that the Vicar must not talk, it would tire him; she\r\ntreated him like a child, with kindly despotism; and there was\r\nsomething childish in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction at having cheated all\r\ntheir expectations. It struck him at once that Philip had been sent\r\nfor, and he was amused that he had been brought on a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand. If\r\nhe could only avoid another of his heart attacks he would get well\r\nenough in a week or two; and he had had the attacks several times\r\nbefore; he always felt as if he were going to die, but he never did.\r\nThey all talked of his constitution, but they none of them knew how\r\nstrong it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to stay a day or two?\xe2\x80\x9d He asked Philip, pretending to\r\nbelieve he had come down for a holiday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip answered cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA breath of sea-air will do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently Dr. Wigram came, and after he had seen the Vicar talked with\r\nPhilip. He adopted an appropriate manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it is the end this time, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\ngreat loss to all of us. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known him for five-and-thirty years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems well enough now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m keeping him alive on drugs, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t last. It was dreadful\r\nthese last two days, I thought he was dead half a dozen times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor was silent for a minute or two, but at the gate he said\r\nsuddenly to Philip:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mrs. Foster said anything to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re very superstitious, these people: she\xe2\x80\x99s got hold of an idea\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99s got something on his mind, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t die till he gets rid\r\nof it; and he can\xe2\x80\x99t bring himself to confess it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not answer, and the doctor went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense. He\xe2\x80\x99s led a very good life, he\xe2\x80\x99s done his\r\nduty, he\xe2\x80\x99s been a good parish priest, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we shall all miss\r\nhim; he can\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to reproach himself with. I very much doubt\r\nwhether the next vicar will suit us half so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor several days Mr. Carey continued without change. His appetite which\r\nhad been excellent left him, and he could eat little. Dr. Wigram did\r\nnot hesitate now to still the pain of the neuritis which tormented him;\r\nand that, with the constant shaking of his palsied limbs, was gradually\r\nexhausting him. His mind remained clear. Philip and Mrs. Foster nursed\r\nhim between them. She was so tired by the many months during which she\r\nhad been attentive to all his wants that Philip insisted on sitting up\r\nwith the patient so that she might have her night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. He passed the\r\nlong hours in an arm-chair so that he should not sleep soundly, and\r\nread by the light of shaded candles The Thousand and One Nights. He had\r\nnot read them since he was a little boy, and they brought back his\r\nchildhood to him. Sometimes he sat and listened to the silence of the\r\nnight. When the effects of the opiate wore off Mr. Carey grew restless\r\nand kept him constantly busy.\r\n\r\nAt last, early one morning, when the birds were chattering noisily in\r\nthe trees, he heard his name called. He went up to the bed. Mr. Carey\r\nwas lying on his back, with his eyes looking at the ceiling; he did not\r\nturn them on Philip. Philip saw that sweat was on his forehead, and he\r\ntook a towel and wiped it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d the old man asked.\r\n\r\nPhilip was startled because the voice was suddenly changed. It was\r\nhoarse and low. So would a man speak if he was cold with fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, d\xe2\x80\x99you want anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and still the unseeing eyes stared at the ceiling.\r\nThen a twitch passed over the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to die for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo tears were wrung from the old man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. They moved Philip\r\nhorribly. His uncle had never betrayed any particular emotion in the\r\naffairs of life; and it was dreadful to see them now, for they\r\nsignified a terror that was unspeakable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend for Mr. Simmonds,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to take the Communion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Simmonds was the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon, or else it\xe2\x80\x99ll be too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip went to awake Mrs. Foster, but it was later than he thought and\r\nshe was up already. He told her to send the gardener with a message,\r\nand he went back to his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you sent for Mr. Simmonds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Philip sat by the bed-side, and occasionally wiped\r\nthe sweating forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hold your hand, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said at last.\r\n\r\nPhilip gave him his hand and he clung to it as to life, for comfort in\r\nhis extremity. Perhaps he had never really loved anyone in all his\r\ndays, but now he turned instinctively to a human being. His hand was\r\nwet and cold. It grasped Philip\xe2\x80\x99s with feeble, despairing energy. The\r\nold man was fighting with the fear of death. And Philip thought that\r\nall must go through that. Oh, how monstrous it was, and they could\r\nbelieve in a God that allowed his creatures to suffer such a cruel\r\ntorture! He had never cared for his uncle, and for two years he had\r\nlonged every day for his death; but now he could not overcome the\r\ncompassion that filled his heart. What a price it was to pay for being\r\nother than the beasts!\r\n\r\nThey remained in silence broken only once by a low inquiry from Mr.\r\nCarey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t he come yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last the housekeeper came in softly to say that Mr. Simmonds was\r\nthere. He carried a bag in which were his surplice and his hood. Mrs.\r\nFoster brought the communion plate. Mr. Simmonds shook hands silently\r\nwith Philip, and then with professional gravity went to the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside. Philip and the maid went out of the room.\r\n\r\nPhilip walked round the garden all fresh and dewy in the morning. The\r\nbirds were singing gaily. The sky was blue, but the air, salt-laden,\r\nwas sweet and cool. The roses were in full bloom. The green of the\r\ntrees, the green of the lawns, was eager and brilliant. Philip walked,\r\nand as he walked he thought of the mystery which was proceeding in that\r\nbedroom. It gave him a peculiar emotion. Presently Mrs. Foster came out\r\nto him and said that his uncle wished to see him. The curate was\r\nputting his things back into the black bag. The sick man turned his\r\nhead a little and greeted him with a smile. Philip was astonished, for\r\nthere was a change in him, an extraordinary change; his eyes had no\r\nlonger the terror-stricken look, and the pinching of his face had gone:\r\nhe looked happy and serene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite prepared now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and his voice had a different tone\r\nin it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Lord sees fit to call me I am ready to give my soul\r\ninto his hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did not speak. He could see that his uncle was sincere. It was\r\nalmost a miracle. He had taken the body and blood of his Savior, and\r\nthey had given him strength so that he no longer feared the inevitable\r\npassage into the night. He knew he was going to die: he was resigned.\r\nHe only said one thing more:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall rejoin my dear wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt startled Philip. He remembered with what a callous selfishness his\r\nuncle had treated her, how obtuse he had been to her humble, devoted\r\nlove. The curate, deeply moved, went away and Mrs. Foster, weeping,\r\naccompanied him to the door. Mr. Carey, exhausted by his effort, fell\r\ninto a light doze, and Philip sat down by the bed and waited for the\r\nend. The morning wore on, and the old man\xe2\x80\x99s breathing grew stertorous.\r\nThe doctor came and said he was dying. He was unconscious and he pecked\r\nfeebly at the sheets; he was restless and he cried out. Dr. Wigram gave\r\nhim a hypodermic injection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t do any good now, he may die at any moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at his watch and then at the patient. Philip saw that\r\nit was one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Dr. Wigram was thinking of his dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use your waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Mrs. Foster asked Philip if he would go to the\r\ncarpenter, who was also the undertaker, and tell him to send up a woman\r\nto lay out the body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want a little fresh air,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe undertaker lived half a mile away. When Philip gave him his\r\nmessage, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did the poor old gentleman die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip hesitated. It occurred to him that it would seem brutal to fetch\r\na woman to wash the body while his uncle still lived, and he wondered\r\nwhy Mrs. Foster had asked him to come. They would think he was in a\r\ngreat hurry to kill the old man off. He thought the undertaker looked\r\nat him oddly. He repeated the question. It irritated Philip. It was no\r\nbusiness of his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did the Vicar pass away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse was to say that it had just happened, but then\r\nit would seem inexplicable if the sick man lingered for several hours.\r\nHe reddened and answered awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly dead yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe undertaker looked at him in perplexity, and he hurried to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Foster is all alone and she wants a woman there. You understood,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you? He may be dead by now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe undertaker nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I see. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send someone up at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Philip got back to the vicarage he went up to the bed-room. Mrs.\r\nFoster rose from her chair by the bed-side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just as he was when you left,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe went down to get herself something to eat, and Philip watched\r\ncuriously the process of death. There was nothing human now in the\r\nunconscious being that struggled feebly. Sometimes a muttered\r\nejaculation issued from the loose mouth. The sun beat down hotly from a\r\ncloudless sky, but the trees in the garden were pleasant and cool. It\r\nwas a lovely day. A bluebottle buzzed against the windowpane. Suddenly\r\nthere was a loud rattle, it made Philip start, it was horribly\r\nfrightening; a movement passed through the limbs and the old man was\r\ndead. The machine had run down. The bluebottle buzzed, buzzed noisily\r\nagainst the windowpane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXII\r\n\r\n\r\nJosiah Graves in his masterful way made arrangements, becoming but\r\neconomical, for the funeral; and when it was over came back to the\r\nvicarage with Philip. The will was in his charge, and with a due sense\r\nof the fitness of things he read it to Philip over an early cup of tea.\r\nIt was written on half a sheet of paper and left everything Mr. Carey\r\nhad to his nephew. There was the furniture, about eighty pounds at the\r\nbank, twenty shares in the A. B. C. company, a few in Allsop\xe2\x80\x99s brewery,\r\nsome in the Oxford music-hall, and a few more in a London restaurant.\r\nThey had been bought under Mr. Graves\xe2\x80\x99 direction, and he told Philip\r\nwith satisfaction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, people must eat, they will drink, and they want amusement.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re always safe if you put your money in what the public thinks\r\nnecessities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words showed a nice discrimination between the grossness of the\r\nvulgar, which he deplored but accepted, and the finer taste of the\r\nelect. Altogether in investments there was about five hundred pounds;\r\nand to that must be added the balance at the bank and what the\r\nfurniture would fetch. It was riches to Philip. He was not happy but\r\ninfinitely relieved.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves left him, after they had discussed the auction which must be\r\nheld as soon as possible, and Philip sat himself down to go through the\r\npapers of the deceased. The Rev. William Carey had prided himself on\r\nnever destroying anything, and there were piles of correspondence\r\ndating back for fifty years and bundles upon bundles of neatly docketed\r\nbills. He had kept not only letters addressed to him, but letters which\r\nhimself had written. There was a yellow packet of letters which he had\r\nwritten to his father in the forties, when as an Oxford undergraduate\r\nhe had gone to Germany for the long vacation. Philip read them idly. It\r\nwas a different William Carey from the William Carey he had known, and\r\nyet there were traces in the boy which might to an acute observer have\r\nsuggested the man. The letters were formal and a little stilted. He\r\nshowed himself strenuous to see all that was noteworthy, and he\r\ndescribed with a fine enthusiasm the castles of the Rhine. The falls of\r\nSchaffhausen made him \xe2\x80\x98offer reverent thanks to the all-powerful\r\nCreator of the universe, whose works were wondrous and beautiful,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhe could not help thinking that they who lived in sight of \xe2\x80\x98this\r\nhandiwork of their blessed Maker must be moved by the contemplation to\r\nlead pure and holy lives.\xe2\x80\x99 Among some bills Philip found a miniature\r\nwhich had been painted of William Carey soon after he was ordained. It\r\nrepresented a thin young curate, with long hair that fell over his head\r\nin natural curls, with dark eyes, large and dreamy, and a pale ascetic\r\nface. Philip remembered the chuckle with which his uncle used to tell\r\nof the dozens of slippers which were worked for him by adoring ladies.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the afternoon and all the evening Philip toiled through the\r\ninnumerable correspondence. He glanced at the address and at the\r\nsignature, then tore the letter in two and threw it into the\r\nwashing-basket by his side. Suddenly he came upon one signed Helen. He\r\ndid not know the writing. It was thin, angular, and old-fashioned. It\r\nbegan: my dear William, and ended: your affectionate sister. Then it\r\nstruck him that it was from his own mother. He had never seen a letter\r\nof hers before, and her handwriting was strange to him. It was about\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMy dear William,\r\n\r\nStephen wrote to you to thank you for your congratulations on the birth\r\nof our son and your kind wishes to myself. Thank God we are both well\r\nand I am deeply thankful for the great mercy which has been shown me.\r\nNow that I can hold a pen I want to tell you and dear Louisa myself how\r\ntruly grateful I am to you both for all your kindness to me now and\r\nalways since my marriage. I am going to ask you to do me a great\r\nfavour. Both Stephen and I wish you to be the boy\xe2\x80\x99s godfather, and we\r\nhope that you will consent. I know I am not asking a small thing, for I\r\nam sure you will take the responsibilities of the position very\r\nseriously, but I am especially anxious that you should undertake this\r\noffice because you are a clergyman as well as the boy\xe2\x80\x99s uncle. I am\r\nvery anxious for the boy\xe2\x80\x99s welfare and I pray God night and day that he\r\nmay grow into a good, honest, and Christian man. With you to guide him\r\nI hope that he will become a soldier in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Faith and be all the\r\ndays of his life God-fearing, humble, and pious.\r\n\r\n                                      Your affectionate sister,\r\n                                                               Helen.\r\n\r\nPhilip pushed the letter away and, leaning forward, rested his face on\r\nhis hands. It deeply touched and at the same time surprised him. He was\r\nastonished at its religious tone, which seemed to him neither mawkish\r\nnor sentimental. He knew nothing of his mother, dead now for nearly\r\ntwenty years, but that she was beautiful, and it was strange to learn\r\nthat she was simple and pious. He had never thought of that side of\r\nher. He read again what she said about him, what she expected and\r\nthought about him; he had turned out very differently; he looked at\r\nhimself for a moment; perhaps it was better that she was dead. Then a\r\nsudden impulse caused him to tear up the letter; its tenderness and\r\nsimplicity made it seem peculiarly private; he had a queer feeling that\r\nthere was something indecent in his reading what exposed his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngentle soul. He went on with the Vicar\xe2\x80\x99s dreary correspondence.\r\n\r\nA few days later he went up to London, and for the first time for two\r\nyears entered by day the hall of St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital. He went to see\r\nthe secretary of the Medical School; he was surprised to see him and\r\nasked Philip curiously what he had been doing. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s experiences had\r\ngiven him a certain confidence in himself and a different outlook upon\r\nmany things: such a question would have embarrassed him before; but now\r\nhe answered coolly, with a deliberate vagueness which prevented further\r\ninquiry, that private affairs had obliged him to make a break in the\r\ncurriculum; he was now anxious to qualify as soon as possible. The\r\nfirst examination he could take was in midwifery and the diseases of\r\nwomen, and he put his name down to be a clerk in the ward devoted to\r\nfeminine ailments; since it was holiday time there happened to be no\r\ndifficulty in getting a post as obstetric clerk; he arranged to\r\nundertake that duty during the last week of August and the first two of\r\nSeptember. After this interview Philip walked through the Medical\r\nSchool, more or less deserted, for the examinations at the end of the\r\nsummer session were all over; and he wandered along the terrace by the\r\nriver-side. His heart was full. He thought that now he could begin a\r\nnew life, and he would put behind him all the errors, follies, and\r\nmiseries of the past. The flowing river suggested that everything\r\npassed, was passing always, and nothing mattered; the future was before\r\nhim rich with possibilities.\r\n\r\nHe went back to Blackstable and busied himself with the settling up of\r\nhis uncle\xe2\x80\x99s estate. The auction was fixed for the middle of August,\r\nwhen the presence of visitors for the summer holidays would make it\r\npossible to get better prices. Catalogues were made out and sent to the\r\nvarious dealers in second-hand books at Tercanbury, Maidstone, and\r\nAshford.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Philip took it into his head to go over to Tercanbury and\r\nsee his old school. He had not been there since the day when, with\r\nrelief in his heart, he had left it with the feeling that thenceforward\r\nhe was his own master. It was strange to wander through the narrow\r\nstreets of Tercanbury which he had known so well for so many years. He\r\nlooked at the old shops, still there, still selling the same things;\r\nthe booksellers with school-books, pious works, and the latest novels\r\nin one window and photographs of the Cathedral and of the city in the\r\nother; the games shop, with its cricket bats, fishing tackle, tennis\r\nrackets, and footballs; the tailor from whom he had got clothes all\r\nthrough his boyhood; and the fishmonger where his uncle whenever he\r\ncame to Tercanbury bought fish. He wandered along the sordid street in\r\nwhich, behind a high wall, lay the red brick house which was the\r\npreparatory school. Further on was the gateway that led into King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSchool, and he stood in the quadrangle round which were the various\r\nbuildings. It was just four and the boys were hurrying out of school.\r\nHe saw the masters in their gowns and mortar-boards, and they were\r\nstrange to him. It was more than ten years since he had left and many\r\nchanges had taken place. He saw the headmaster; he walked slowly down\r\nfrom the schoolhouse to his own, talking to a big boy who Philip\r\nsupposed was in the sixth; he was little changed, tall, cadaverous,\r\nromantic as Philip remembered him, with the same wild eyes; but the\r\nblack beard was streaked with gray now and the dark, sallow face was\r\nmore deeply lined. Philip had an impulse to go up and speak to him, but\r\nhe was afraid he would have forgotten him, and he hated the thought of\r\nexplaining who he was.\r\n\r\nBoys lingered talking to one another, and presently some who had\r\nhurried to change came out to play fives; others straggled out in twos\r\nand threes and went out of the gateway, Philip knew they were going up\r\nto the cricket ground; others again went into the precincts to bat at\r\nthe nets. Philip stood among them a stranger; one or two gave him an\r\nindifferent glance; but visitors, attracted by the Norman staircase,\r\nwere not rare and excited little attention. Philip looked at them\r\ncuriously. He thought with melancholy of the distance that separated\r\nhim from them, and he thought bitterly how much he had wanted to do and\r\nhow little done. It seemed to him that all those years, vanished beyond\r\nrecall, had been utterly wasted. The boys, fresh and buoyant, were\r\ndoing the same things that he had done, it seemed that not a day had\r\npassed since he left the school, and yet in that place where at least\r\nby name he had known everybody now he knew not a soul. In a few years\r\nthese too, others taking their place, would stand alien as he stood;\r\nbut the reflection brought him no solace; it merely impressed upon him\r\nthe futility of human existence. Each generation repeated the trivial\r\nround. He wondered what had become of the boys who were his companions:\r\nthey were nearly thirty now; some would be dead, but others were\r\nmarried and had children; they were soldiers and parsons, doctors,\r\nlawyers; they were staid men who were beginning to put youth behind\r\nthem. Had any of them made such a hash of life as he? He thought of the\r\nboy he had been devoted to; it was funny, he could not recall his name;\r\nhe remembered exactly what he looked like, he had been his greatest\r\nfriend; but his name would not come back to him. He looked back with\r\namusement on the jealous emotions he had suffered on his account. It\r\nwas irritating not to recollect his name. He longed to be a boy again,\r\nlike those he saw sauntering through the quadrangle, so that, avoiding\r\nhis mistakes, he might start fresh and make something more out of life.\r\nHe felt an intolerable loneliness. He almost regretted the penury which\r\nhe had suffered during the last two years, since the desperate struggle\r\nmerely to keep body and soul together had deadened the pain of living.\r\nIn the sweat of thy brow shalt thou earn thy daily bread: it was not a\r\ncurse upon mankind, but the balm which reconciled it to existence.\r\n\r\nBut Philip was impatient with himself; he called to mind his idea of\r\nthe pattern of life: the unhappiness he had suffered was no more than\r\npart of a decoration which was elaborate and beautiful; he told himself\r\nstrenuously that he must accept with gaiety everything, dreariness and\r\nexcitement, pleasure and pain, because it added to the richness of the\r\ndesign. He sought for beauty consciously, and he remembered how even as\r\na boy he had taken pleasure in the Gothic cathedral as one saw it from\r\nthe precincts; he went there and looked at the massive pile, gray under\r\nthe cloudy sky, with the central tower that rose like the praise of men\r\nto their God; but the boys were batting at the nets, and they were\r\nlissom and strong and active; he could not help hearing their shouts\r\nand laughter. The cry of youth was insistent, and he saw the beautiful\r\nthing before him only with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the last week in August Philip entered upon his\r\nduties in the \xe2\x80\x98district.\xe2\x80\x99 They were arduous, for he had to attend on an\r\naverage three confinements a day. The patient had obtained a \xe2\x80\x98card\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfrom the hospital some time before; and when her time came it was taken\r\nto the porter by a messenger, generally a little girl, who was then\r\nsent across the road to the house in which Philip lodged. At night the\r\nporter, who had a latch-key, himself came over and awoke Philip. It was\r\nmysterious then to get up in the darkness and walk through the deserted\r\nstreets of the South Side. At those hours it was generally the husband\r\nwho brought the card. If there had been a number of babies before he\r\ntook it for the most part with surly indifference, but if newly married\r\nhe was nervous and then sometimes strove to allay his anxiety by\r\ngetting drunk. Often there was a mile or more to walk, during which\r\nPhilip and the messenger discussed the conditions of labour and the\r\ncost of living; Philip learnt about the various trades which were\r\npractised on that side of the river. He inspired confidence in the\r\npeople among whom he was thrown, and during the long hours that he\r\nwaited in a stuffy room, the woman in labour lying on a large bed that\r\ntook up half of it, her mother and the midwife talked to him as\r\nnaturally as they talked to one another. The circumstances in which he\r\nhad lived during the last two years had taught him several things about\r\nthe life of the very poor, which it amused them to find he knew; and\r\nthey were impressed because he was not deceived by their little\r\nsubterfuges. He was kind, and he had gentle hands, and he did not lose\r\nhis temper. They were pleased because he was not above drinking a cup\r\nof tea with them, and when the dawn came and they were still waiting\r\nthey offered him a slice of bread and dripping; he was not squeamish\r\nand could eat most things now with a good appetite. Some of the houses\r\nhe went to, in filthy courts off a dingy street, huddled against one\r\nanother without light or air, were merely squalid; but others,\r\nunexpectedly, though dilapidated, with worm-eaten floors and leaking\r\nroofs, had the grand air: you found in them oak balusters exquisitely\r\ncarved, and the walls had still their panelling. These were thickly\r\ninhabited. One family lived in each room, and in the daytime there was\r\nthe incessant noise of children playing in the court. The old walls\r\nwere the breeding-place of vermin; the air was so foul that often,\r\nfeeling sick, Philip had to light his pipe. The people who dwelt here\r\nlived from hand to mouth. Babies were unwelcome, the man received them\r\nwith surly anger, the mother with despair; it was one more mouth to\r\nfeed, and there was little enough wherewith to feed those already\r\nthere. Philip often discerned the wish that the child might be born\r\ndead or might die quickly. He delivered one woman of twins (a source of\r\nhumour to the facetious) and when she was told she burst into a long,\r\nshrill wail of misery. Her mother said outright:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to feed \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the Lord\xe2\x80\x99ll see fit to take \xe2\x80\x99em to \xe2\x80\x99imself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the midwife.\r\n\r\nPhilip caught sight of the husband\xe2\x80\x99s face as he looked at the tiny pair\r\nlying side by side, and there was a ferocious sullenness in it which\r\nstartled him. He felt in the family assembled there a hideous\r\nresentment against those poor atoms who had come into the world\r\nunwished for; and he had a suspicion that if he did not speak firmly an\r\n\xe2\x80\x98accident\xe2\x80\x99 would occur. Accidents occurred often; mothers \xe2\x80\x98overlay\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntheir babies, and perhaps errors of diet were not always the result of\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come every day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI warn you that if anything happens\r\nto them there\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be an inquest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father made no reply, but he gave Philip a scowl. There was murder\r\nin his soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless their little \xe2\x80\x99earts,\xe2\x80\x9d said the grandmother, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat should \xe2\x80\x99appen\r\nto them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty was to keep the mothers in bed for ten days, which\r\nwas the minimum upon which the hospital practice insisted. It was\r\nawkward to look after the family, no one would see to the children\r\nwithout payment, and the husband tumbled because his tea was not right\r\nwhen he came home tired from his work and hungry. Philip had heard that\r\nthe poor helped one another, but woman after woman complained to him\r\nthat she could not get anyone in to clean up and see to the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndinner without paying for the service, and she could not afford to pay.\r\nBy listening to the women as they talked and by chance remarks from\r\nwhich he could deduce much that was left unsaid, Philip learned how\r\nlittle there was in common between the poor and the classes above them.\r\nThey did not envy their betters, for the life was too different, and\r\nthey had an ideal of ease which made the existence of the\r\nmiddle-classes seem formal and stiff; moreover, they had a certain\r\ncontempt for them because they were soft and did not work with their\r\nhands. The proud merely wished to be left alone, but the majority\r\nlooked upon the well-to-do as people to be exploited; they knew what to\r\nsay in order to get such advantages as the charitable put at their\r\ndisposal, and they accepted benefits as a right which came to them from\r\nthe folly of their superiors and their own astuteness. They bore the\r\ncurate with contemptuous indifference, but the district visitor excited\r\ntheir bitter hatred. She came in and opened your windows without so\r\nmuch as a by your leave or with your leave, \xe2\x80\x99and me with my bronchitis,\r\nenough to give me my death of cold;\xe2\x80\x99 she poked her nose into corners,\r\nand if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t say the place was dirty you saw what she thought\r\nright enough, \xe2\x80\x98an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for them as \xe2\x80\x98as servants, but I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to see what she\xe2\x80\x99d make of \xe2\x80\x99er room if she \xe2\x80\x99ad four children, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ad to do the cookin\xe2\x80\x99, and mend their clothes, and wash them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip discovered that the greatest tragedy of life to these people was\r\nnot separation or death, that was natural and the grief of it could be\r\nassuaged with tears, but loss of work. He saw a man come home one\r\nafternoon, three days after his wife\xe2\x80\x99s confinement, and tell her he had\r\nbeen dismissed; he was a builder and at that time work was slack; he\r\nstated the fact, and sat down to his tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jim,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe man ate stolidly some mess which had been stewing in a sauce-pan\r\nagainst his coming; he stared at his plate; his wife looked at him two\r\nor three times, with little startled glances, and then quite silently\r\nbegan to cry. The builder was an uncouth little fellow with a rough,\r\nweather-beaten face and a long white scar on his forehead; he had\r\nlarge, stubbly hands. Presently he pushed aside his plate as if he must\r\ngive up the effort to force himself to eat, and turned a fixed gaze out\r\nof the window. The room was at the top of the house, at the back, and\r\none saw nothing but sullen clouds. The silence seemed heavy with\r\ndespair. Philip felt that there was nothing to be said, he could only\r\ngo; and as he walked away wearily, for he had been up most of the\r\nnight, his heart was filled with rage against the cruelty of the world.\r\nHe knew the hopelessness of the search for work and the desolation\r\nwhich is harder to bear than hunger. He was thankful not to have to\r\nbelieve in God, for then such a condition of things would be\r\nintolerable; one could reconcile oneself to existence only because it\r\nwas meaningless.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Philip that the people who spent their time in helping the\r\npoorer classes erred because they sought to remedy things which would\r\nharass them if themselves had to endure them without thinking that they\r\ndid not in the least disturb those who were used to them. The poor did\r\nnot want large airy rooms; they suffered from cold, for their food was\r\nnot nourishing and their circulation bad; space gave them a feeling of\r\nchilliness, and they wanted to burn as little coal as need be; there\r\nwas no hardship for several to sleep in one room, they preferred it;\r\nthey were never alone for a moment, from the time they were born to the\r\ntime they died, and loneliness oppressed them; they enjoyed the\r\npromiscuity in which they dwelt, and the constant noise of their\r\nsurroundings pressed upon their ears unnoticed. They did not feel the\r\nneed of taking a bath constantly, and Philip often heard them speak\r\nwith indignation of the necessity to do so with which they were faced\r\non entering the hospital: it was both an affront and a discomfort. They\r\nwanted chiefly to be left alone; then if the man was in regular work\r\nlife went easily and was not without its pleasures: there was plenty of\r\ntime for gossip, after the day\xe2\x80\x99s work a glass of beer was very good to\r\ndrink, the streets were a constant source of entertainment, if you\r\nwanted to read there was Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 or The News of the World; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nthere, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out \xe2\x80\x99ow the time did fly, the truth was and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, you was a rare one for reading when you was a girl, but\r\nwhat with one thing and another you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get no time now not even to\r\nread the paper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe usual practice was to pay three visits after a confinement, and one\r\nSunday Philip went to see a patient at the dinner hour. She was up for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in bed no longer, I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m not one for\r\nidling, and it gives me the fidgets to be there and do nothing all day\r\nlong, so I said to \xe2\x80\x99Erb, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to get up and cook your dinner\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Erb was sitting at table with his knife and fork already in his hands.\r\nHe was a young man, with an open face and blue eyes. He was earning\r\ngood money, and as things went the couple were in easy circumstances.\r\nThey had only been married a few months, and were both delighted with\r\nthe rosy boy who lay in the cradle at the foot of the bed. There was a\r\nsavoury smell of beefsteak in the room and Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned to the\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to dish up this minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just have a look at the son and heir\r\nand then I\xe2\x80\x99ll take myself off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHusband and wife laughed at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s expression, and \xe2\x80\x99Erb getting up\r\nwent over with Philip to the cradle. He looked at his baby proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem much wrong with him, does there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nHe took up his hat, and by this time \xe2\x80\x99Erb\xe2\x80\x99s wife had dished up the\r\nbeefsteak and put on the table a plate of green peas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a nice dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s only in of a Sunday and I like to \xe2\x80\x99ave something special for him,\r\nso as he shall miss his \xe2\x80\x99ome when he\xe2\x80\x99s out at work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d be above sittin\xe2\x80\x99 down and \xe2\x80\x99avin\xe2\x80\x99 a bit of dinner with\r\nus?\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x99Erb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99Erb,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, in a shocked tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip, with his attractive smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I call friendly, I knew \xe2\x80\x99e wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take offence,\r\nPolly. Just get another plate, my girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPolly was flustered, and she thought \xe2\x80\x99Erb a regular caution, you never\r\nknew what ideas \xe2\x80\x99e\xe2\x80\x99d get in \xe2\x80\x99is \xe2\x80\x99ead next; but she got a plate and\r\nwiped it quickly with her apron, then took a new knife and fork from\r\nthe chest of drawers, where her best cutlery rested among her best\r\nclothes. There was a jug of stout on the table, and \xe2\x80\x99Erb poured Philip\r\nout a glass. He wanted to give him the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the beefsteak,\r\nbut Philip insisted that they should share alike. It was a sunny room\r\nwith two windows that reached to the floor; it had been the parlour of\r\na house which at one time was if not fashionable at least respectable:\r\nit might have been inhabited fifty years before by a well-to-do\r\ntradesman or an officer on half pay. \xe2\x80\x99Erb had been a football player\r\nbefore he married, and there were photographs on the wall of various\r\nteams in self-conscious attitudes, with neatly plastered hair, the\r\ncaptain seated proudly in the middle holding a cup. There were other\r\nsigns of prosperity: photographs of the relations of \xe2\x80\x99Erb and his wife\r\nin Sunday clothes; on the chimney-piece an elaborate arrangement of\r\nshells stuck on a miniature rock; and on each side mugs, \xe2\x80\x98A present\r\nfrom Southend\xe2\x80\x99 in Gothic letters, with pictures of a pier and a parade\r\non them. \xe2\x80\x99Erb was something of a character; he was a non-union man and\r\nexpressed himself with indignation at the efforts of the union to force\r\nhim to join. The union wasn\xe2\x80\x99t no good to him, he never found no\r\ndifficulty in getting work, and there was good wages for anyone as \xe2\x80\x99ad\r\na head on his shoulders and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t above puttin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99is \xe2\x80\x99and to anything\r\nas come \xe2\x80\x99is way. Polly was timorous. If she was \xe2\x80\x99im she\xe2\x80\x99d join the\r\nunion, the last time there was a strike she was expectin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99im to be\r\nbrought back in an ambulance every time he went out. She turned to\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s that obstinate, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doing anything with \xe2\x80\x99im.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what I say is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a free country, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be dictated to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a free country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprevent \xe2\x80\x99em bashin\xe2\x80\x99 your \xe2\x80\x99ead in if they get the chanst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished Philip passed his pouch over to \xe2\x80\x99Erb and they\r\nlit their pipes; then he got up, for a \xe2\x80\x98call\xe2\x80\x99 might be waiting for him\r\nat his rooms, and shook hands. He saw that it had given them pleasure\r\nthat he shared their meal, and they saw that he had thoroughly enjoyed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x99Erb, \xe2\x80\x9cand I \xe2\x80\x99ope we shall \xe2\x80\x99ave as nice a\r\ndoctor next time the missus disgraces \xe2\x80\x99erself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on with you, \xe2\x80\x99Erb,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Ow d\xe2\x80\x99you know there\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nbe a next time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three weeks which the appointment lasted drew to an end. Philip had\r\nattended sixty-two cases, and he was tired out. When he came home about\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock on his last night he hoped with all his heart that he would\r\nnot be called out again. He had not had a whole night\xe2\x80\x99s rest for ten\r\ndays. The case which he had just come from was horrible. He had been\r\nfetched by a huge, burly man, the worse for liquor, and taken to a room\r\nin an evil-smelling court, which was filthier than any he had seen: it\r\nwas a tiny attic; most of the space was taken up by a wooden bed, with\r\na canopy of dirty red hangings, and the ceiling was so low that Philip\r\ncould touch it with the tips of his fingers; with the solitary candle\r\nthat afforded what light there was he went over it, frizzling up the\r\nbugs that crawled upon it. The woman was a blowsy creature of middle\r\nage, who had had a long succession of still-born children. It was a\r\nstory that Philip was not unaccustomed to: the husband had been a\r\nsoldier in India; the legislation forced upon that country by the\r\nprudery of the English public had given a free run to the most\r\ndistressing of all diseases; the innocent suffered. Yawning, Philip\r\nundressed and took a bath, then shook his clothes over the water and\r\nwatched the animals that fell out wriggling. He was just going to get\r\ninto bed when there was a knock at the door, and the hospital porter\r\nbrought him a card.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the last person I wanted to see\r\ntonight. Who\xe2\x80\x99s brought it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x99usband, sir. Shall I tell him to wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at the address, saw that the street was familiar to him,\r\nand told the porter that he would find his own way. He dressed himself\r\nand in five minutes, with his black bag in his hand, stepped into the\r\nstreet. A man, whom he could not see in the darkness, came up to him,\r\nand said he was the husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d better wait, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty rough\r\nneighbour\xe2\x80\x99ood, and them not knowing who you was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your heart, they all know the doctor, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in some damned\r\nsight rougher places than Waver Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite true. The black bag was a passport through wretched alleys\r\nand down foul-smelling courts into which a policeman was not ready to\r\nventure by himself. Once or twice a little group of men had looked at\r\nPhilip curiously as he passed; he heard a mutter of observations and\r\nthen one say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x99orspital doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he went by one or two of them said: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall \xe2\x80\x99ave to step out if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who\r\naccompanied him now. \xe2\x80\x9cThey told me there was no time to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you leave it so late?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, as he quickened his pace.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the fellow as they passed a lamp-post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look awfully young,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m turned eighteen, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was fair, and he had not a hair on his face, he looked no more than\r\na boy; he was short, but thick set.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re young to be married,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe \xe2\x80\x99ad to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much d\xe2\x80\x99you earn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixteen, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSixteen shillings a week was not much to keep a wife and child on. The\r\nroom the couple lived in showed that their poverty was extreme. It was\r\na fair size, but it looked quite large, since there was hardly any\r\nfurniture in it; there was no carpet on the floor; there were no\r\npictures on the walls; and most rooms had something, photographs or\r\nsupplements in cheap frames from the Christmas numbers of the\r\nillustrated papers. The patient lay on a little iron bed of the\r\ncheapest sort. It startled Philip to see how young she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, she can\xe2\x80\x99t be more than sixteen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the woman who had\r\ncome in to \xe2\x80\x98see her through.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had given her age as eighteen on the card, but when they were very\r\nyoung they often put on a year or two. Also she was pretty, which was\r\nrare in those classes in which the constitution has been undermined by\r\nbad food, bad air, and unhealthy occupations; she had delicate features\r\nand large blue eyes, and a mass of dark hair done in the elaborate\r\nfashion of the coster girl. She and her husband were very nervous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better wait outside, so as to be at hand if I want you,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip\r\nsaid to him.\r\n\r\nNow that he saw him better Philip was surprised again at his boyish\r\nair: you felt that he should be larking in the street with the other\r\nlads instead of waiting anxiously for the birth of a child. The hours\r\npassed, and it was not till nearly two that the baby was born.\r\nEverything seemed to be going satisfactorily; the husband was called\r\nin, and it touched Philip to see the awkward, shy way in which he\r\nkissed his wife; Philip packed up his things. Before going he felt once\r\nmore his patient\xe2\x80\x99s pulse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her quickly: something had happened. In cases of emergency\r\nthe S. O. C.\xe2\x80\x94senior obstetric clerk\xe2\x80\x94had to be sent for; he was a\r\nqualified man, and the \xe2\x80\x98district\xe2\x80\x99 was in his charge. Philip scribbled a\r\nnote, and giving it to the husband, told him to run with it to the\r\nhospital; he bade him hurry, for his wife was in a dangerous state. The\r\nman set off. Philip waited anxiously; he knew the woman was bleeding to\r\ndeath; he was afraid she would die before his chief arrived; he took\r\nwhat steps he could. He hoped fervently that the S. O. C. would not\r\nhave been called elsewhere. The minutes were interminable. He came at\r\nlast, and, while he examined the patient, in a low voice asked Philip\r\nquestions. Philip saw by his face that he thought the case very grave.\r\nHis name was Chandler. He was a tall man of few words, with a long nose\r\nand a thin face much lined for his age. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was hopeless from the beginning. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him to wait on the stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better bring him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip opened the door and called him. He was sitting in the dark on\r\nthe first step of the flight that led to the next floor. He came up to\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s internal bleeding. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to stop it.\xe2\x80\x9d The S. O.\r\nC. hesitated a moment, and because it was a painful thing to say he\r\nforced his voice to become brusque. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man did not say a word; he stopped quite still, looking at his\r\nwife, who lay, pale and unconscious, on the bed. It was the midwife who\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentlemen \xe2\x80\x99ave done all they could, \xe2\x80\x99Arry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw what\r\nwas comin\xe2\x80\x99 from the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler.\r\n\r\nThere were no curtains on the windows, and gradually the night seemed\r\nto lighten; it was not yet the dawn, but the dawn was at hand. Chandler\r\nwas keeping the woman alive by all the means in his power, but life was\r\nslipping away from her, and suddenly she died. The boy who was her\r\nhusband stood at the end of the cheap iron bed with his hands resting\r\non the rail; he did not speak; but he looked very pale and once or\r\ntwice Chandler gave him an uneasy glance, thinking he was going to\r\nfaint: his lips were gray. The midwife sobbed noisily, but he took no\r\nnotice of her. His eyes were fixed upon his wife, and in them was an\r\nutter bewilderment. He reminded you of a dog whipped for something he\r\ndid not know was wrong. When Chandler and Philip had gathered together\r\ntheir things Chandler turned to the husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better lie down for a bit. I expect you\xe2\x80\x99re about done up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere for me to lie down, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, and there was\r\nin his voice a humbleness which was very distressing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know anyone in the house who\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a shakedown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey only moved in last week,\xe2\x80\x9d said the midwife. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nnobody yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChandler hesitated a moment awkwardly, then he went up to the man and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry this has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand and the man, with an instinctive glance at his own\r\nto see if it was clean, shook it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip shook hands with him too. Chandler told the midwife to come and\r\nfetch the certificate in the morning. They left the house and walked\r\nalong together in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt upsets one a bit at first, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chandler at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bit,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the porter not to bring you any more calls\r\ntonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off duty at eight in the morning in any case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many cases have you had?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixty-three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get your certificate then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the hospital, and the S. O. C. went in to see if anyone\r\nwanted him. Philip walked on. It had been very hot all the day before,\r\nand even now in the early morning there was a balminess in the air. The\r\nstreet was very still. Philip did not feel inclined to go to bed. It\r\nwas the end of his work and he need not hurry. He strolled along, glad\r\nof the fresh air and the silence; he thought that he would go on to the\r\nbridge and look at day break on the river. A policeman at the corner\r\nbade him good-morning. He knew who Philip was from his bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut late tonight, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPhilip nodded and passed. He leaned against the parapet and looked\r\ntowards the morning. At that hour the great city was like a city of the\r\ndead. The sky was cloudless, but the stars were dim at the approach of\r\nday; there was a light mist on the river, and the great buildings on\r\nthe north side were like palaces in an enchanted island. A group of\r\nbarges was moored in midstream. It was all of an unearthly violet,\r\ntroubling somehow and awe-inspiring; but quickly everything grew pale,\r\nand cold, and gray. Then the sun rose, a ray of yellow gold stole\r\nacross the sky, and the sky was iridescent. Philip could not get out of\r\nhis eyes the dead girl lying on the bed, wan and white, and the boy who\r\nstood at the end of it like a stricken beast. The bareness of the\r\nsqualid room made the pain of it more poignant. It was cruel that a\r\nstupid chance should have cut off her life when she was just entering\r\nupon it; but in the very moment of saying this to himself, Philip\r\nthought of the life which had been in store for her, the bearing of\r\nchildren, the dreary fight with poverty, the youth broken by toil and\r\ndeprivation into a slatternly middle age\xe2\x80\x94he saw the pretty face grow\r\nthin and white, the hair grow scanty, the pretty hands, worn down\r\nbrutally by work, become like the claws of an old animal\xe2\x80\x94then, when the\r\nman was past his prime, the difficulty of getting jobs, the small wages\r\nhe had to take; and the inevitable, abject penury of the end: she might\r\nbe energetic, thrifty, industrious, it would not have saved her; in the\r\nend was the workhouse or subsistence on the charity of her children.\r\nWho could pity her because she had died when life offered so little?\r\n\r\nBut pity was inane. Philip felt it was not that which these people\r\nneeded. They did not pity themselves. They accepted their fate. It was\r\nthe natural order of things. Otherwise, good heavens! otherwise they\r\nwould swarm over the river in their multitude to the side where those\r\ngreat buildings were, secure and stately, and they would pillage, burn,\r\nand sack. But the day, tender and pale, had broken now, and the mist\r\nwas tenuous; it bathed everything in a soft radiance; and the Thames\r\nwas gray, rosy, and green; gray like mother-of-pearl and green like the\r\nheart of a yellow rose. The wharfs and store-houses of the Surrey Side\r\nwere massed in disorderly loveliness. The scene was so exquisite that\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat passionately. He was overwhelmed by the beauty of\r\nthe world. Beside that nothing seemed to matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip spent the few weeks that remained before the beginning of the\r\nwinter session in the out-patients\xe2\x80\x99 department, and in October settled\r\ndown to regular work. He had been away from the hospital for so long\r\nthat he found himself very largely among new people; the men of\r\ndifferent years had little to do with one another, and his\r\ncontemporaries were now mostly qualified: some had left to take up\r\nassistantships or posts in country hospitals and infirmaries, and some\r\nheld appointments at St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s. The two years during which his mind\r\nhad lain fallow had refreshed him, he fancied, and he was able now to\r\nwork with energy.\r\n\r\nThe Athelnys were delighted with his change of fortune. He had kept\r\naside a few things from the sale of his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s effects and gave them\r\nall presents. He gave Sally a gold chain that had belonged to his aunt.\r\nShe was now grown up. She was apprenticed to a dressmaker and set out\r\nevery morning at eight to work all day in a shop in Regent Street.\r\nSally had frank blue eyes, a broad brow, and plentiful shining hair;\r\nshe was buxom, with broad hips and full breasts; and her father, who\r\nwas fond of discussing her appearance, warned her constantly that she\r\nmust not grow fat. She attracted because she was healthy, animal, and\r\nfeminine. She had many admirers, but they left her unmoved; she gave\r\none the impression that she looked upon love-making as nonsense; and it\r\nwas easy to imagine that young men found her unapproachable. Sally was\r\nold for her years: she had been used to help her mother in the\r\nhousehold work and in the care of the children, so that she had\r\nacquired a managing air, which made her mother say that Sally was a bit\r\ntoo fond of having things her own way. She did not speak very much, but\r\nas she grew older she seemed to be acquiring a quiet sense of humour,\r\nand sometimes uttered a remark which suggested that beneath her\r\nimpassive exterior she was quietly bubbling with amusement at her\r\nfellow-creatures. Philip found that with her he never got on the terms\r\nof affectionate intimacy upon which he was with the rest of Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhuge family. Now and then her indifference slightly irritated him.\r\nThere was something enigmatic in her.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip gave her the necklace Athelny in his boisterous way\r\ninsisted that she must kiss him; but Sally reddened and drew back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful hussy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like being kissed by men,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip saw her embarrassment, and, amused, turned Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nto something else. That was never a very difficult thing to do. But\r\nevidently her mother spoke of the matter later, for next time Philip\r\ncame she took the opportunity when they were alone for a couple of\r\nminutes to refer to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it disagreeable of me last week when I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d She blushed a little as she\r\nuttered the formal phrase which she had prepared. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always value\r\nthe necklace, and it was very kind of you to give it me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip found it always a little difficult to talk to her. She did all\r\nthat she had to do very competently, but seemed to feel no need of\r\nconversation; yet there was nothing unsociable in her. One Sunday\r\nafternoon when Athelny and his wife had gone out together, and Philip,\r\ntreated as one of the family, sat reading in the parlour, Sally came in\r\nand sat by the window to sew. The girls\xe2\x80\x99 clothes were made at home and\r\nSally could not afford to spend Sundays in idleness. Philip thought she\r\nwished to talk and put down his book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on reading,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only thought as you were alone I\xe2\x80\x99d come\r\nand sit with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the most silent person I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever struck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want another one who\xe2\x80\x99s talkative in this house,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThere was no irony in her tone: she was merely stating a fact. But it\r\nsuggested to Philip that she measured her father, alas, no longer the\r\nhero he was to her childhood, and in her mind joined together his\r\nentertaining conversation and the thriftlessness which often brought\r\ndifficulties into their life; she compared his rhetoric with her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s practical common sense; and though the liveliness of her\r\nfather amused her she was perhaps sometimes a little impatient with it.\r\nPhilip looked at her as she bent over her work; she was healthy,\r\nstrong, and normal; it must be odd to see her among the other girls in\r\nthe shop with their flat chests and anaemic faces. Mildred suffered\r\nfrom anaemia.\r\n\r\nAfter a time it appeared that Sally had a suitor. She went out\r\noccasionally with friends she had made in the work-room, and had met a\r\nyoung man, an electrical engineer in a very good way of business, who\r\nwas a most eligible person. One day she told her mother that he had\r\nasked her to marry him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I told him I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over-anxious to marry anyone just yet awhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe paused a little as was her habit between observations. \xe2\x80\x9cHe took on\r\nso that I said he might come to tea on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an occasion that thoroughly appealed to Athelny. He rehearsed\r\nall the afternoon how he should play the heavy father for the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s edification till he reduced his children to helpless giggling.\r\nJust before he was due Athelny routed out an Egyptian tarboosh and\r\ninsisted on putting it on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on with you, Athelny,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, who was in her best, which\r\nwas of black velvet, and, since she was growing stouter every year,\r\nvery tight for her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil the girl\xe2\x80\x99s chances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to pull it off, but the little man skipped nimbly out of her\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhand me, woman. Nothing will induce me to take it off. This young\r\nman must be shown at once that it is no ordinary family he is preparing\r\nto enter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him keep it on, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally, in her even, indifferent\r\nfashion. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Donaldson doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take it the way it\xe2\x80\x99s meant he can\r\ntake himself off, and good riddance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip thought it was a severe ordeal that the young man was being\r\nexposed to, since Athelny, in his brown velvet jacket, flowing black\r\ntie, and red tarboosh, was a startling spectacle for an innocent\r\nelectrical engineer. When he came he was greeted by his host with the\r\nproud courtesy of a Spanish grandee and by Mrs. Athelny in an\r\naltogether homely and natural fashion. They sat down at the old\r\nironing-table in the high-backed monkish chairs, and Mrs. Athelny\r\npoured tea out of a lustre teapot which gave a note of England and the\r\ncountry-side to the festivity. She had made little cakes with her own\r\nhand, and on the table was home-made jam. It was a farm-house tea, and\r\nto Philip very quaint and charming in that Jacobean house. Athelny for\r\nsome fantastic reason took it into his head to discourse upon Byzantine\r\nhistory; he had been reading the later volumes of the Decline and Fall;\r\nand, his forefinger dramatically extended, he poured into the\r\nastonished ears of the suitor scandalous stories about Theodora and\r\nIrene. He addressed himself directly to his guest with a torrent of\r\nrhodomontade; and the young man, reduced to helpless silence and shy,\r\nnodded his head at intervals to show that he took an intelligent\r\ninterest. Mrs. Athelny paid no attention to Thorpe\xe2\x80\x99s conversation, but\r\ninterrupted now and then to offer the young man more tea or to press\r\nupon him cake and jam. Philip watched Sally; she sat with downcast\r\neyes, calm, silent, and observant; and her long eye-lashes cast a\r\npretty shadow on her cheek. You could not tell whether she was amused\r\nat the scene or if she cared for the young man. She was inscrutable.\r\nBut one thing was certain: the electrical engineer was good-looking,\r\nfair and clean-shaven, with pleasant, regular features, and an honest\r\nface; he was tall and well-made. Philip could not help thinking he\r\nwould make an excellent mate for her, and he felt a pang of envy for\r\nthe happiness which he fancied was in store for them.\r\n\r\nPresently the suitor said he thought it was about time he was getting\r\nalong. Sally rose to her feet without a word and accompanied him to the\r\ndoor. When she came back her father burst out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sally, we think your young man very nice. We are prepared to\r\nwelcome him into our family. Let the banns be called and I will compose\r\na nuptial song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally set about clearing away the tea-things. She did not answer.\r\nSuddenly she shot a swift glance at Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think of him, Mr. Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had always refused to call him Uncle Phil as the other children\r\ndid, and would not call him Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d make an awfully handsome pair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly once more, and then with a slight blush went\r\non with her business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought him a very nice civil-spoken young fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nAthelny, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think he\xe2\x80\x99s just the sort to make any girl happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally did not reply for a minute or two, and Philip looked at her\r\ncuriously: it might be thought that she was meditating upon what her\r\nmother had said, and on the other hand she might be thinking of the man\r\nin the moon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer when you\xe2\x80\x99re spoken to, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked her\r\nmother, a little irritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was a silly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to have him then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much more you want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Athelny, and it was\r\nquite clear now that she was put out. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a very decent young fellow\r\nand he can afford to give you a thorough good home. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got quite\r\nenough to feed here without you. If you get a chance like that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwicked not to take it. And I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to have a girl to do\r\nthe rough work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had never before heard Mrs. Athelny refer so directly to the\r\ndifficulties of her life. He saw how important it was that each child\r\nshould be provided for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good your carrying on, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally in her quiet way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re a very hard-hearted, cruel, selfish girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want me to earn my own living, mother, I can always go into\r\nservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so silly, you know your father would never let you do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip caught Sally\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and he thought there was in it a glimmer of\r\namusement. He wondered what there had been in the conversation to touch\r\nher sense of humour. She was an odd girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his last year at St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s Philip had to work hard. He was\r\ncontented with life. He found it very comfortable to be heart-free and\r\nto have enough money for his needs. He had heard people speak\r\ncontemptuously of money: he wondered if they had ever tried to do\r\nwithout it. He knew that the lack made a man petty, mean, grasping; it\r\ndistorted his character and caused him to view the world from a vulgar\r\nangle; when you had to consider every penny, money became of grotesque\r\nimportance: you needed a competency to rate it at its proper value. He\r\nlived a solitary life, seeing no one except the Athelnys, but he was\r\nnot lonely; he busied himself with plans for the future, and sometimes\r\nhe thought of the past. His recollection dwelt now and then on old\r\nfriends, but he made no effort to see them. He would have liked to know\r\nwhat was become of Norah Nesbit; she was Norah something else now, but\r\nhe could not remember the name of the man she was going to marry; he\r\nwas glad to have known her: she was a good and a brave soul. One\r\nevening about half past eleven he saw Lawson, walking along Piccadilly;\r\nhe was in evening clothes and might be supposed to be coming back from\r\na theatre. Philip gave way to a sudden impulse and quickly turned down\r\na side street. He had not seen him for two years and felt that he could\r\nnot now take up again the interrupted friendship. He and Lawson had\r\nnothing more to say to one another. Philip was no longer interested in\r\nart; it seemed to him that he was able to enjoy beauty with greater\r\nforce than when he was a boy; but art appeared to him unimportant. He\r\nwas occupied with the forming of a pattern out of the manifold chaos of\r\nlife, and the materials with which he worked seemed to make\r\npreoccupation with pigments and words very trivial. Lawson had served\r\nhis turn. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s friendship with him had been a motive in the design\r\nhe was elaborating: it was merely sentimental to ignore the fact that\r\nthe painter was of no further interest to him.\r\n\r\nSometimes Philip thought of Mildred. He avoided deliberately the\r\nstreets in which there was a chance of seeing her; but occasionally\r\nsome feeling, perhaps curiosity, perhaps something deeper which he\r\nwould not acknowledge, made him wander about Piccadilly and Regent\r\nStreet during the hours when she might be expected to be there. He did\r\nnot know then whether he wished to see her or dreaded it. Once he saw a\r\nback which reminded him of hers, and for a moment he thought it was\r\nshe; it gave him a curious sensation: it was a strange sharp pain in\r\nhis heart, there was fear in it and a sickening dismay; and when he\r\nhurried on and found that he was mistaken he did not know whether it\r\nwas relief that he experienced or disappointment.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of August Philip passed his surgery, his last\r\nexamination, and received his diploma. It was seven years since he had\r\nentered St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital. He was nearly thirty. He walked down the\r\nstairs of the Royal College of Surgeons with the roll in his hand which\r\nqualified him to practice, and his heart beat with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m really going to begin life,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nNext day he went to the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s office to put his name down for one\r\nof the hospital appointments. The secretary was a pleasant little man\r\nwith a black beard, whom Philip had always found very affable. He\r\ncongratulated him on his success, and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to do a locum for a month on the South\r\ncoast? Three guineas a week with board and lodging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s at Farnley, in Dorsetshire. Doctor South. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to go down\r\nat once; his assistant has developed mumps. I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a very\r\npleasant place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s manner that puzzled Philip. It\r\nwas a little doubtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the crab in it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe secretary hesitated a moment and laughed in a conciliating fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the fact is, I understand he\xe2\x80\x99s rather a crusty, funny old\r\nfellow. The agencies won\xe2\x80\x99t send him anyone any more. He speaks his mind\r\nvery openly, and men don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut d\xe2\x80\x99you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied with a man who\xe2\x80\x99s only just\r\nqualified? After all I have no experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to be glad to get you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the secretary diplomatically.\r\n\r\nPhilip thought for a moment. He had nothing to do for the next few\r\nweeks, and he was glad of the chance to earn a bit of money. He could\r\nput it aside for the holiday in Spain which he had promised himself\r\nwhen he had finished his appointment at St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s or, if they would\r\nnot give him anything there, at some other hospital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is, you must go this afternoon. Will that suit you? If\r\nso, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send a wire at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip would have liked a few days to himself; but he had seen the\r\nAthelnys the night before (he had gone at once to take them his good\r\nnews) and there was really no reason why he should not start\r\nimmediately. He had little luggage to pack. Soon after seven that\r\nevening he got out of the station at Farnley and took a cab to Doctor\r\nSouth\xe2\x80\x99s. It was a broad low stucco house, with a Virginia creeper\r\ngrowing over it. He was shown into the consulting-room. An old man was\r\nwriting at a desk. He looked up as the maid ushered Philip in. He did\r\nnot get up, and he did not speak; he merely stared at Philip. Philip\r\nwas taken aback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re expecting me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe secretary of St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwired to you this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kept dinner back for half an hour. D\xe2\x80\x99you want to wash?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nDoctor South amused him by his odd manner. He got up now, and Philip\r\nsaw that he was a man of middle height, thin, with white hair cut very\r\nshort and a long mouth closed so tightly that he seemed to have no lips\r\nat all; he was clean-shaven but for small white whiskers, and they\r\nincreased the squareness of face which his firm jaw gave him. He wore a\r\nbrown tweed suit and a white stock. His clothes hung loosely about him\r\nas though they had been made for a much larger man. He looked like a\r\nrespectable farmer of the middle of the nineteenth century. He opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the dining-room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the door opposite.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour bed-room is the first door you come to when you get on the\r\nlanding. Come downstairs when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring dinner Philip knew that Doctor South was examining him, but he\r\nspoke little, and Philip felt that he did not want to hear his\r\nassistant talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen were you qualified?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you at a university?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast year when my assistant took a holiday they sent me a \xe2\x80\x99Varsity\r\nman. I told \xe2\x80\x99em not to do it again. Too damned gentlemanly for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. The dinner was very simple and very good.\r\nPhilip preserved a sedate exterior, but in his heart he was bubbling\r\nover with excitement. He was immensely elated at being engaged as a\r\nlocum; it made him feel extremely grown up; he had an insane desire to\r\nlaugh at nothing in particular; and the more he thought of his\r\nprofessional dignity the more he was inclined to chuckle.\r\n\r\nBut Doctor South broke suddenly into his thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting on for thirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you\xe2\x80\x99re only just qualified?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t go in for the medical till I was nearly twenty-three, and I\r\nhad to give it up for two years in the middle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoverty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor South gave him an odd look and relapsed into silence. At the end\r\nof dinner he got up from the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know what sort of a practice this is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMostly fishermen and their families. I have the Union and the Seamen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHospital. I used to be alone here, but since they tried to make this\r\ninto a fashionable sea-side resort a man has set up on the cliff, and\r\nthe well-to-do people go to him. I only have those who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to\r\npay for a doctor at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip saw that the rivalry was a sore point with the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I have no experience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou none of you know anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked out of the room without another word and left Philip by\r\nhimself. When the maid came in to clear away she told Philip that\r\nDoctor South saw patients from six till seven. Work for that night was\r\nover. Philip fetched a book from his room, lit his pipe, and settled\r\nhimself down to read. It was a great comfort, since he had read nothing\r\nbut medical books for the last few months. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Doctor South\r\ncame in and looked at him. Philip hated not to have his feet up, and he\r\nhad dragged up a chair for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem able to make yourself pretty comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor South,\r\nwith a grimness which would have disturbed Philip if he had not been in\r\nsuch high spirits.\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes twinkled as he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor South gave him a look, but did not reply directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeregrine Pickle. Smollett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI happen to know that Smollett wrote Peregrine Pickle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. Medical men aren\xe2\x80\x99t much interested in literature,\r\nare they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had put the book down on the table, and Doctor South took it up.\r\nIt was a volume of an edition which had belonged to the Vicar of\r\nBlackstable. It was a thin book bound in faded morocco, with a\r\ncopperplate engraving as a frontispiece; the pages were musty with age\r\nand stained with mould. Philip, without meaning to, started forward a\r\nlittle as Doctor South took the volume in his hands, and a slight smile\r\ncame into his eyes. Very little escaped the old doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I amuse you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked icily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you\xe2\x80\x99re fond of books. You can always tell by the way people\r\nhandle them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n Doctor South put down the novel immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast at eight-thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a funny old fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Philip.\r\n\r\nHe soon discovered why Doctor South\xe2\x80\x99s assistants found it difficult to\r\nget on with him. In the first place, he set his face firmly against all\r\nthe discoveries of the last thirty years: he had no patience with the\r\ndrugs which became modish, were thought to work marvellous cures, and\r\nin a few years were discarded; he had stock mixtures which he had\r\nbrought from St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s where he had been a student, and had used all\r\nhis life; he found them just as efficacious as anything that had come\r\ninto fashion since. Philip was startled at Doctor South\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion of\r\nasepsis; he had accepted it in deference to universal opinion; but he\r\nused the precautions which Philip had known insisted upon so\r\nscrupulously at the hospital with the disdainful tolerance of a man\r\nplaying at soldiers with children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen antiseptics come along and sweep everything before them, and\r\nthen I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen asepsis take their place. Bunkum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young men who were sent down to him knew only hospital practice;\r\nand they came with the unconcealed scorn for the General Practitioner\r\nwhich they had absorbed in the air at the hospital; but they had seen\r\nonly the complicated cases which appeared in the wards; they knew how\r\nto treat an obscure disease of the suprarenal bodies, but were helpless\r\nwhen consulted for a cold in the head. Their knowledge was theoretical\r\nand their self-assurance unbounded. Doctor South watched them with\r\ntightened lips; he took a savage pleasure in showing them how great was\r\ntheir ignorance and how unjustified their conceit. It was a poor\r\npractice, of fishing folk, and the doctor made up his own\r\nprescriptions. Doctor South asked his assistant how he expected to make\r\nboth ends meet if he gave a fisherman with a stomach-ache a mixture\r\nconsisting of half a dozen expensive drugs. He complained too that the\r\nyoung medical men were uneducated: their reading consisted of The\r\nSporting Times and The British Medical Journal; they could neither\r\nwrite a legible hand nor spell correctly. For two or three days Doctor\r\nSouth watched Philip closely, ready to fall on him with acid sarcasm if\r\nhe gave him the opportunity; and Philip, aware of this, went about his\r\nwork with a quiet sense of amusement. He was pleased with the change of\r\noccupation. He liked the feeling of independence and of responsibility.\r\nAll sorts of people came to the consulting-room. He was gratified\r\nbecause he seemed able to inspire his patients with confidence; and it\r\nwas entertaining to watch the process of cure which at a hospital\r\nnecessarily could be watched only at distant intervals. His rounds took\r\nhim into low-roofed cottages in which were fishing tackle and sails and\r\nhere and there mementoes of deep-sea travelling, a lacquer box from\r\nJapan, spears and oars from Melanesia, or daggers from the bazaars of\r\nStamboul; there was an air of romance in the stuffy little rooms, and\r\nthe salt of the sea gave them a bitter freshness. Philip liked to talk\r\nto the sailor-men, and when they found that he was not supercilious\r\nthey told him long yarns of the distant journeys of their youth.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice he made a mistake in diagnosis: (he had never seen a case\r\nof measles before, and when he was confronted with the rash took it for\r\nan obscure disease of the skin;) and once or twice his ideas of\r\ntreatment differed from Doctor South\xe2\x80\x99s. The first time this happened\r\nDoctor South attacked him with savage irony; but Philip took it with\r\ngood humour; he had some gift for repartee, and he made one or two\r\nanswers which caused Doctor South to stop and look at him curiously.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s face was grave, but his eyes were twinkling. The old gentleman\r\ncould not avoid the impression that Philip was chaffing him. He was\r\nused to being disliked and feared by his assistants, and this was a new\r\nexperience. He had half a mind to fly into a passion and pack Philip\r\noff by the next train, he had done that before with his assistants; but\r\nhe had an uneasy feeling that Philip then would simply laugh at him\r\noutright; and suddenly he felt amused. His mouth formed itself into a\r\nsmile against his will, and he turned away. In a little while he grew\r\nconscious that Philip was amusing himself systematically at his\r\nexpense. He was taken aback at first and then diverted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn his impudence,\xe2\x80\x9d he chuckled to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn his impudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip had written to Athelny to tell him that he was doing a locum in\r\nDorsetshire and in due course received an answer from him. It was\r\nwritten in the formal manner he affected, studded with pompous epithets\r\nas a Persian diadem was studded with precious stones; and in the\r\nbeautiful hand, like black letter and as difficult to read, upon which\r\nhe prided himself. He suggested that Philip should join him and his\r\nfamily in the Kentish hop-field to which he went every year; and to\r\npersuade him said various beautiful and complicated things about\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s soul and the winding tendrils of the hops. Philip replied at\r\nonce that he would come on the first day he was free. Though not born\r\nthere, he had a peculiar affection for the Isle of Thanet, and he was\r\nfired with enthusiasm at the thought of spending a fortnight so close\r\nto the earth and amid conditions which needed only a blue sky to be as\r\nidyllic as the olive groves of Arcady.\r\n\r\nThe four weeks of his engagement at Farnley passed quickly. On the\r\ncliff a new town was springing up, with red brick villas round golf\r\nlinks, and a large hotel had recently been opened to cater for the\r\nsummer visitors; but Philip went there seldom. Down below, by the\r\nharbour, the little stone houses of a past century were clustered in a\r\ndelightful confusion, and the narrow streets, climbing down steeply,\r\nhad an air of antiquity which appealed to the imagination. By the\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x99s edge were neat cottages with trim, tiny gardens in front of\r\nthem; they were inhabited by retired captains in the merchant service,\r\nand by mothers or widows of men who had gained their living by the sea;\r\nand they had an appearance which was quaint and peaceful. In the little\r\nharbour came tramps from Spain and the Levant, ships of small tonnage;\r\nand now and then a windjammer was borne in by the winds of romance. It\r\nreminded Philip of the dirty little harbour with its colliers at\r\nBlackstable, and he thought that there he had first acquired the\r\ndesire, which was now an obsession, for Eastern lands and sunlit\r\nislands in a tropic sea. But here you felt yourself closer to the wide,\r\ndeep ocean than on the shore of that North Sea which seemed always\r\ncircumscribed; here you could draw a long breath as you looked out upon\r\nthe even vastness; and the west wind, the dear soft salt wind of\r\nEngland, uplifted the heart and at the same time melted it to\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when Philip had reached his last week with Doctor South, a\r\nchild came to the surgery door while the old doctor and Philip were\r\nmaking up prescriptions. It was a little ragged girl with a dirty face\r\nand bare feet. Philip opened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, will you come to Mrs. Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s in Ivy Lane at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Mrs. Fletcher?\xe2\x80\x9d called out Doctor South in his\r\nrasping voice.\r\n\r\nThe child took no notice of him, but addressed herself again to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, her little boy\xe2\x80\x99s had an accident and will you come at\r\nonce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Mrs. Fletcher I\xe2\x80\x99m coming,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Doctor South.\r\n\r\nThe little girl hesitated for a moment, and putting a dirty finger in a\r\ndirty mouth stood still and looked at Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Kid?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, Mrs. Fletcher says, will the new doctor come?\xe2\x80\x9d There was\r\na sound in the dispensary and Doctor South came out into the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Fletcher satisfied with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he barked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve attended Mrs.\r\nFletcher since she was born. Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t I good enough to attend her\r\nfilthy brat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little girl looked for a moment as though she were going to cry,\r\nthen she thought better of it; she put out her tongue deliberately at\r\nDoctor South, and, before he could recover from his astonishment,\r\nbolted off as fast as she could run. Philip saw that the old gentleman\r\nwas annoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look rather fagged, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a goodish way to Ivy Lane,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nby way of giving him an excuse not to go himself.\r\n\r\nDoctor South gave a low snarl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a damned sight nearer for a man who\xe2\x80\x99s got the use of both legs\r\nthan for a man who\xe2\x80\x99s only got one and a half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip reddened and stood silent for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish me to go or will you go yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last\r\nfrigidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of my going? They want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip took up his hat and went to see the patient. It was hard upon\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he came back. Doctor South was standing in the\r\ndining-room with his back to the fireplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you start dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I chose to wait. Have you been all this while at Mrs.\r\nFletcher\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I stopped to look at the sunset on my way\r\nback, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor South did not reply, and the servant brought in some grilled\r\nsprats. Philip ate them with an excellent appetite. Suddenly Doctor\r\nSouth shot a question at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you look at the sunset?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip answered with his mouth full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor South gave him an odd look, and the shadow of a smile flickered\r\nacross his old, tired face. They ate the rest of the dinner in silence;\r\nbut when the maid had given them the port and left the room, the old\r\nman leaned back and fixed his sharp eyes on Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople always do, directly or indirectly, when they get angry with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they know it\xe2\x80\x99s your weak point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip faced him and looked at him steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very glad to have discovered it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor did not answer, but he gave a chuckle of bitter mirth. They\r\nsat for a while staring at one another. Then Doctor South surprised\r\nPhilip extremely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you stay here and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get rid of that damned fool with his\r\nmumps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you, but I hope to get an appointment at the\r\nhospital in the autumn. It\xe2\x80\x99ll help me so much in getting other work\r\nlater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m offering you a partnership,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor South grumpily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey seem to like you down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that was a fact which altogether met with your\r\napproval,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip said drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you suppose that after forty years\xe2\x80\x99 practice I care a twopenny damn\r\nwhether people prefer my assistant to me? No, my friend. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nsentiment between my patients and me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect gratitude from\r\nthem, I expect them to pay my fees. Well, what d\xe2\x80\x99you say to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip made no reply, not because he was thinking over the proposal,\r\nbut because he was astonished. It was evidently very unusual for\r\nsomeone to offer a partnership to a newly qualified man; and he\r\nrealised with wonder that, although nothing would induce him to say so,\r\nDoctor South had taken a fancy to him. He thought how amused the\r\nsecretary at St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s would be when he told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe practice brings in about seven hundred a year. We can reckon out\r\nhow much your share would be worth, and you can pay me off by degrees.\r\nAnd when I die you can succeed me. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s better than knocking\r\nabout hospitals for two or three years, and then taking assistantships\r\nuntil you can afford to set up for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip knew it was a chance that most people in his profession would\r\njump at; the profession was over-crowded, and half the men he knew\r\nwould be thankful to accept the certainty of even so modest a\r\ncompetence as that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt means giving up\r\neverything I\xe2\x80\x99ve aimed at for years. In one way and another I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a\r\nroughish time, but I always had that one hope before me, to get\r\nqualified so that I might travel; and now, when I wake in the morning,\r\nmy bones simply ache to get off, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind where particularly, but\r\njust away, to places I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the goal seemed very near. He would have finished his appointment\r\nat St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s by the middle of the following year, and then he would go\r\nto Spain; he could afford to spend several months there, rambling up\r\nand down the land which stood to him for romance; after that he would\r\nget a ship and go to the East. Life was before him and time of no\r\naccount. He could wander, for years if he chose, in unfrequented\r\nplaces, amid strange peoples, where life was led in strange ways. He\r\ndid not know what he sought or what his journeys would bring him; but\r\nhe had a feeling that he would learn something new about life and gain\r\nsome clue to the mystery that he had solved only to find more\r\nmysterious. And even if he found nothing he would allay the unrest\r\nwhich gnawed at his heart. But Doctor South was showing him a great\r\nkindness, and it seemed ungrateful to refuse his offer for no adequate\r\nreason; so in his shy way, trying to appear as matter of fact as\r\npossible, he made some attempt to explain why it was so important to\r\nhim to carry out the plans he had cherished so passionately.\r\n\r\nDoctor South listened quietly, and a gentle look came into his shrewd\r\nold eyes. It seemed to Philip an added kindness that he did not press\r\nhim to accept his offer. Benevolence is often very peremptory. He\r\nappeared to look upon Philip\xe2\x80\x99s reasons as sound. Dropping the subject,\r\nhe began to talk of his own youth; he had been in the Royal Navy, and\r\nit was his long connection with the sea that, when he retired, had made\r\nhim settle at Farnley. He told Philip of old days in the Pacific and of\r\nwild adventures in China. He had taken part in an expedition against\r\nthe head-hunters of Borneo and had known Samoa when it was still an\r\nindependent state. He had touched at coral islands. Philip listened to\r\nhim entranced. Little by little he told Philip about himself. Doctor\r\nSouth was a widower, his wife had died thirty years before, and his\r\ndaughter had married a farmer in Rhodesia; he had quarrelled with him,\r\nand she had not come to England for ten years. It was just as if he had\r\nnever had wife or child. He was very lonely. His gruffness was little\r\nmore than a protection which he wore to hide a complete\r\ndisillusionment; and to Philip it seemed tragic to see him just waiting\r\nfor death, not impatiently, but rather with loathing for it, hating old\r\nage and unable to resign himself to its limitations, and yet with the\r\nfeeling that death was the only solution of the bitterness of his life.\r\nPhilip crossed his path, and the natural affection which long\r\nseparation from his daughter had killed\xe2\x80\x94she had taken her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart in the quarrel and her children he had never seen\xe2\x80\x94settled itself\r\nupon Philip. At first it made him angry, he told himself it was a sign\r\nof dotage; but there was something in Philip that attracted him, and he\r\nfound himself smiling at him he knew not why. Philip did not bore him.\r\nOnce or twice he put his hand on his shoulder: it was as near a caress\r\nas he had got since his daughter left England so many years before.\r\nWhen the time came for Philip to go Doctor South accompanied him to the\r\nstation: he found himself unaccountably depressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a ripping time here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been awfully kind\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re very glad to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed myself here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you want to get out into the world? Ah, you have youth.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhesitated a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to remember that if you change your\r\nmind my offer still stands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awfully kind of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip shook hands with him out of the carriage window, and the train\r\nsteamed out of the station. Philip thought of the fortnight he was\r\ngoing to spend in the hop-field: he was happy at the idea of seeing his\r\nfriends again, and he rejoiced because the day was fine. But Doctor\r\nSouth walked slowly back to his empty house. He felt very old and very\r\nlonely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening when Philip arrived at Ferne. It was Mrs.\r\nAthelny\xe2\x80\x99s native village, and she had been accustomed from her\r\nchildhood to pick in the hop-field to which with her husband and her\r\nchildren she still went every year. Like many Kentish folk her family\r\nhad gone out regularly, glad to earn a little money, but especially\r\nregarding the annual outing, looked forward to for months, as the best\r\nof holidays. The work was not hard, it was done in common, in the open\r\nair, and for the children it was a long, delightful picnic; here the\r\nyoung men met the maidens; in the long evenings when work was over they\r\nwandered about the lanes, making love; and the hopping season was\r\ngenerally followed by weddings. They went out in carts with bedding,\r\npots and pans, chairs and tables; and Ferne while the hopping lasted\r\nwas deserted. They were very exclusive and would have resented the\r\nintrusion of foreigners, as they called the people who came from\r\nLondon; they looked down upon them and feared them too; they were a\r\nrough lot, and the respectable country folk did not want to mix with\r\nthem. In the old days the hoppers slept in barns, but ten years ago a\r\nrow of huts had been erected at the side of a meadow; and the Athelnys,\r\nlike many others, had the same hut every year.\r\n\r\nAthelny met Philip at the station in a cart he had borrowed from the\r\npublic-house at which he had got a room for Philip. It was a quarter of\r\na mile from the hop-field. They left his bag there and walked over to\r\nthe meadow in which were the huts. They were nothing more than a long,\r\nlow shed, divided into little rooms about twelve feet square. In front\r\nof each was a fire of sticks, round which a family was grouped, eagerly\r\nwatching the cooking of supper. The sea-air and the sun had browned\r\nalready the faces of Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s children. Mrs. Athelny seemed a\r\ndifferent woman in her sun-bonnet: you felt that the long years in the\r\ncity had made no real difference to her; she was the country woman born\r\nand bred, and you could see how much at home she found herself in the\r\ncountry. She was frying bacon and at the same time keeping an eye on\r\nthe younger children, but she had a hearty handshake and a jolly smile\r\nfor Philip. Athelny was enthusiastic over the delights of a rural\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re starved for sun and light in the cities we live in. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlife, it\xe2\x80\x99s a long imprisonment. Let us sell all we have, Betty, and\r\ntake a farm in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see you in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered with good-humoured scorn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the first rainy day we had in the winter you\xe2\x80\x99d be crying for\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cAthelny\xe2\x80\x99s always like this when we come\r\ndown here. Country, I like that! Why, he don\xe2\x80\x99t know a swede from a\r\nmangel-wurzel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaddy was lazy today,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Jane, with the frankness which\r\ncharacterized her, \xe2\x80\x9che didn\xe2\x80\x99t fill one bin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting into practice, child, and tomorrow I shall fill more bins\r\nthan all of you put together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and eat your supper, children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stepped out of their little hut, and the flames of the wood fire\r\nleaped up and cast sharp colour upon her face. Of late Philip had only\r\nseen her in the trim frocks she had taken to since she was at the\r\ndressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s, and there was something very charming in the print dress\r\nshe wore now, loose and easy to work in; the sleeves were tucked up and\r\nshowed her strong, round arms. She too had a sun-bonnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look like a milkmaid in a fairy story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, as he shook\r\nhands with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the belle of the hop-fields,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cMy word, if the\r\nSquire\xe2\x80\x99s son sees you he\xe2\x80\x99ll make you an offer of marriage before you\r\ncan say Jack Robinson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Squire hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a son, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally.\r\n\r\nShe looked about for a place to sit down in, and Philip made room for\r\nher beside him. She looked wonderful in the night lit by wood fires.\r\nShe was like some rural goddess, and you thought of those fresh, strong\r\ngirls whom old Herrick had praised in exquisite numbers. The supper was\r\nsimple, bread and butter, crisp bacon, tea for the children, and beer\r\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Athelny and Philip. Athelny, eating hungrily, praised\r\nloudly all he ate. He flung words of scorn at Lucullus and piled\r\ninvectives upon Brillat-Savarin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing one can say for you, Athelny,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ndo enjoy your food and no mistake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCooked by your hand, my Betty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stretching out an eloquent\r\nforefinger.\r\n\r\nPhilip felt himself very comfortable. He looked happily at the line of\r\nfires, with people grouped about them, and the colour of the flames\r\nagainst the night; at the end of the meadow was a line of great elms,\r\nand above the starry sky. The children talked and laughed, and Athelny,\r\na child among them, made them roar by his tricks and fancies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey think a rare lot of Athelny down here,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mrs.\r\nBridges said to me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we should do without Mr. Athelny\r\nnow, she said. He\xe2\x80\x99s always up to something, he\xe2\x80\x99s more like a schoolboy\r\nthan the father of a family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally sat in silence, but she attended to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s wants in a\r\nthoughtful fashion that charmed him. It was pleasant to have her beside\r\nhim, and now and then he glanced at her sunburned, healthy face. Once\r\nhe caught her eyes, and she smiled quietly. When supper was over Jane\r\nand a small brother were sent down to a brook that ran at the bottom of\r\nthe meadow to fetch a pail of water for washing up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou children, show your Uncle Philip where we sleep, and then you must\r\nbe thinking of going to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSmall hands seized Philip, and he was dragged towards the hut. He went\r\nin and struck a match. There was no furniture in it; and beside a tin\r\nbox, in which clothes were kept, there was nothing but the beds; there\r\nwere three of them, one against each wall. Athelny followed Philip in\r\nand showed them proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the stuff to sleep on,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of your\r\nspring-mattresses and swansdown. I never sleep so soundly anywhere as\r\nhere. YOU will sleep between sheets. My dear fellow, I pity you from\r\nthe bottom of my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beds consisted of a thick layer of hopvine, on the top of which was\r\na coating of straw, and this was covered with a blanket. After a day in\r\nthe open air, with the aromatic scent of the hops all round them, the\r\nhappy pickers slept like tops. By nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock all was quiet in the\r\nmeadow and everyone in bed but one or two men who still lingered in the\r\npublic-house and would not come back till it was closed at ten. Athelny\r\nwalked there with Philip. But before he went Mrs. Athelny said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe breakfast about a quarter to six, but I daresay you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nget up as early as that. You see, we have to set to work at six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he must get up early,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athelny, \xe2\x80\x9cand he must work like\r\nthe rest of us. He\xe2\x80\x99s got to earn his board. No work, no dinner, my\r\nlad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children go down to bathe before breakfast, and they can give you\r\na call on their way back. They pass The Jolly Sailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they\xe2\x80\x99ll wake me I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and bathe with them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nJane and Harold and Edward shouted with delight at the prospect, and\r\nnext morning Philip was awakened out of a sound sleep by their bursting\r\ninto his room. The boys jumped on his bed, and he had to chase them out\r\nwith his slippers. He put on a coat and a pair of trousers and went\r\ndown. The day had only just broken, and there was a nip in the air; but\r\nthe sky was cloudless, and the sun was shining yellow. Sally, holding\r\nConnie\xe2\x80\x99s hand, was standing in the middle of the road, with a towel and\r\na bathing-dress over her arm. He saw now that her sun-bonnet was of the\r\ncolour of lavender, and against it her face, red and brown, was like an\r\napple. She greeted him with her slow, sweet smile, and he noticed\r\nsuddenly that her teeth were small and regular and very white. He\r\nwondered why they had never caught his attention before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was for letting you sleep on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they would go up and\r\nwake you. I said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked down the road and then cut across the marshes. That way it\r\nwas under a mile to the sea. The water looked cold and gray, and Philip\r\nshivered at the sight of it; but the others tore off their clothes and\r\nran in shouting. Sally did everything a little slowly, and she did not\r\ncome into the water till all the rest were splashing round Philip.\r\nSwimming was his only accomplishment; he felt at home in the water; and\r\nsoon he had them all imitating him as he played at being a porpoise,\r\nand a drowning man, and a fat lady afraid of wetting her hair. The\r\nbathe was uproarious, and it was necessary for Sally to be very severe\r\nto induce them all to come out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re as bad as any of them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Philip, in her grave,\r\nmaternal way, which was at once comic and touching. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nanything like so naughty when you\xe2\x80\x99re not here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked back, Sally with her bright hair streaming over one\r\nshoulder and her sun-bonnet in her hand, but when they got to the huts\r\nMrs. Athelny had already started for the hop-garden. Athleny, in a pair\r\nof the oldest trousers anyone had ever worn, his jacket buttoned up to\r\nshow he had no shirt on, and in a wide-brimmed soft hat, was frying\r\nkippers over a fire of sticks. He was delighted with himself: he looked\r\nevery inch a brigand. As soon as he saw the party he began to shout the\r\nwitches\xe2\x80\x99 chorus from Macbeth over the odorous kippers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t dawdle over your breakfast or mother will be angry,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, when they came up.\r\n\r\nAnd in a few minutes, Harold and Jane with pieces of bread and butter\r\nin their hands, they sauntered through the meadow into the hop-field.\r\nThey were the last to leave. A hop-garden was one of the sights\r\nconnected with Philip\xe2\x80\x99s boyhood and the oast-houses to him the most\r\ntypical feature of the Kentish scene. It was with no sense of\r\nstrangeness, but as though he were at home, that Philip followed Sally\r\nthrough the long lines of the hops. The sun was bright now and cast a\r\nsharp shadow. Philip feasted his eyes on the richness of the green\r\nleaves. The hops were yellowing, and to him they had the beauty and the\r\npassion which poets in Sicily have found in the purple grape. As they\r\nwalked along Philip felt himself overwhelmed by the rich luxuriance. A\r\nsweet scent arose from the fat Kentish soil, and the fitful September\r\nbreeze was heavy with the goodly perfume of the hops. Athelstan felt\r\nthe exhilaration instinctively, for he lifted up his voice and sang; it\r\nwas the cracked voice of the boy of fifteen, and Sally turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou be quiet, Athelstan, or we shall have a thunderstorm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment they heard the hum of voices, and in a moment more came\r\nupon the pickers. They were all hard at work, talking and laughing as\r\nthey picked. They sat on chairs, on stools, on boxes, with their\r\nbaskets by their sides, and some stood by the bin throwing the hops\r\nthey picked straight into it. There were a lot of children about and a\r\ngood many babies, some in makeshift cradles, some tucked up in a rug on\r\nthe soft brown dry earth. The children picked a little and played a\r\ngreat deal. The women worked busily, they had been pickers from\r\nchildhood, and they could pick twice as fast as foreigners from London.\r\nThey boasted about the number of bushels they had picked in a day, but\r\nthey complained you could not make money now as in former times: then\r\nthey paid you a shilling for five bushels, but now the rate was eight\r\nand even nine bushels to the shilling. In the old days a good picker\r\ncould earn enough in the season to keep her for the rest of the year,\r\nbut now there was nothing in it; you got a holiday for nothing, and\r\nthat was about all. Mrs. Hill had bought herself a pianner out of what\r\nshe made picking, so she said, but she was very near, one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto be near like that, and most people thought it was only what she\r\nsaid, if the truth was known perhaps it would be found that she had put\r\na bit of money from the savings bank towards it.\r\n\r\nThe hoppers were divided into bin companies of ten pickers, not\r\ncounting children, and Athelny loudly boasted of the day when he would\r\nhave a company consisting entirely of his own family. Each company had\r\na bin-man, whose duty it was to supply it with strings of hops at their\r\nbins (the bin was a large sack on a wooden frame, about seven feet\r\nhigh, and long rows of them were placed between the rows of hops;) and\r\nit was to this position that Athelny aspired when his family was old\r\nenough to form a company. Meanwhile he worked rather by encouraging\r\nothers than by exertions of his own. He sauntered up to Mrs. Athelny,\r\nwho had been busy for half an hour and had already emptied a basket\r\ninto the bin, and with his cigarette between his lips began to pick. He\r\nasserted that he was going to pick more than anyone that day, but\r\nmother; of course no one could pick so much as mother; that reminded\r\nhim of the trials which Aphrodite put upon the curious Psyche, and he\r\nbegan to tell his children the story of her love for the unseen\r\nbridegroom. He told it very well. It seemed to Philip, listening with a\r\nsmile on his lips, that the old tale fitted in with the scene. The sky\r\nwas very blue now, and he thought it could not be more lovely even in\r\nGreece. The children with their fair hair and rosy cheeks, strong,\r\nhealthy, and vivacious; the delicate form of the hops; the challenging\r\nemerald of the leaves, like a blare of trumpets; the magic of the green\r\nalley, narrowing to a point as you looked down the row, with the\r\npickers in their sun-bonnets: perhaps there was more of the Greek\r\nspirit there than you could find in the books of professors or in\r\nmuseums. He was thankful for the beauty of England. He thought of the\r\nwinding white roads and the hedgerows, the green meadows with their\r\nelm-trees, the delicate line of the hills and the copses that crowned\r\nthem, the flatness of the marshes, and the melancholy of the North Sea.\r\nHe was very glad that he felt its loveliness. But presently Athelny\r\ngrew restless and announced that he would go and ask how Robert Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother was. He knew everyone in the garden and called them all by their\r\nChristian names; he knew their family histories and all that had\r\nhappened to them from birth. With harmless vanity he played the fine\r\ngentleman among them, and there was a touch of condescension in his\r\nfamiliarity. Philip would not go with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to earn my dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Athelny, with a wave of the hand, as he\r\nstrolled away. \xe2\x80\x9cNo work, no dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip had not a basket of his own, but sat with Sally. Jane thought it\r\nmonstrous that he should help her elder sister rather than herself, and\r\nhe had to promise to pick for her when Sally\xe2\x80\x99s basket was full. Sally\r\nwas almost as quick as her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t it hurt your hands for sewing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, it wants soft hands. That\xe2\x80\x99s why women pick better than men. If\r\nyour hands are hard and your fingers all stiff with a lot of rough work\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t pick near so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe liked to see her deft movements, and she watched him too now and\r\nthen with that maternal spirit of hers which was so amusing and yet so\r\ncharming. He was clumsy at first, and she laughed at him. When she bent\r\nover and showed him how best to deal with a whole line their hands met.\r\nHe was surprised to see her blush. He could not persuade himself that\r\nshe was a woman; because he had known her as a flapper, he could not\r\nhelp looking upon her as a child still; yet the number of her admirers\r\nshowed that she was a child no longer; and though they had only been\r\ndown a few days one of Sally\xe2\x80\x99s cousins was already so attentive that\r\nshe had to endure a lot of chaffing. His name was Peter Gann, and he\r\nwas the son of Mrs. Athelny\xe2\x80\x99s sister, who had married a farmer near\r\nFerne. Everyone knew why he found it necessary to walk through the\r\nhop-field every day.\r\n\r\nA call-off by the sounding of a horn was made for breakfast at eight,\r\nand though Mrs. Athelny told them they had not deserved it, they ate it\r\nvery heartily. They set to work again and worked till twelve, when the\r\nhorn sounded once more for dinner. At intervals the measurer went his\r\nround from bin to bin, accompanied by the booker, who entered first in\r\nhis own book and then in the hopper\xe2\x80\x99s the number of bushels picked. As\r\neach bin was filled it was measured out in bushel baskets into a huge\r\nbag called a poke; and this the measurer and the pole-puller carried\r\noff between them and put on the waggon. Athelny came back now and then\r\nwith stories of how much Mrs. Heath or Mrs. Jones had picked, and he\r\nconjured his family to beat her: he was always wanting to make records,\r\nand sometimes in his enthusiasm picked steadily for an hour. His chief\r\namusement in it, however, was that it showed the beauty of his graceful\r\nhands, of which he was excessively proud. He spent much time manicuring\r\nthem. He told Philip, as he stretched out his tapering fingers, that\r\nthe Spanish grandees had always slept in oiled gloves to preserve their\r\nwhiteness. The hand that wrung the throat of Europe, he remarked\r\ndramatically, was as shapely and exquisite as a woman\xe2\x80\x99s; and he looked\r\nat his own, as he delicately picked the hops, and sighed with\r\nself-satisfaction. When he grew tired of this he rolled himself a\r\ncigarette and discoursed to Philip of art and literature. In the\r\nafternoon it grew very hot. Work did not proceed so actively and\r\nconversation halted. The incessant chatter of the morning dwindled now\r\nto desultory remarks. Tiny beads of sweat stood on Sally\xe2\x80\x99s upper lip,\r\nand as she worked her lips were slightly parted. She was like a rosebud\r\nbursting into flower.\r\n\r\nCalling-off time depended on the state of the oast-house. Sometimes it\r\nwas filled early, and as many hops had been picked by three or four as\r\ncould be dried during the night. Then work was stopped. But generally\r\nthe last measuring of the day began at five. As each company had its\r\nbin measured it gathered up its things and, chatting again now that\r\nwork was over, sauntered out of the garden. The women went back to the\r\nhuts to clean up and prepare the supper, while a good many of the men\r\nstrolled down the road to the public-house. A glass of beer was very\r\npleasant after the day\xe2\x80\x99s work.\r\n\r\nThe Athelnys\xe2\x80\x99 bin was the last to be dealt with. When the measurer came\r\nMrs. Athelny, with a sigh of relief, stood up and stretched her arms:\r\nshe had been sitting in the same position for many hours and was stiff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to The Jolly Sailor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelny. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rites of the\r\nday must be duly performed, and there is none more sacred than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a jug with you, Athelny,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cand bring back a pint\r\nand a half for supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him the money, copper by copper. The bar-parlour was already\r\nwell filled. It had a sanded floor, benches round it, and yellow\r\npictures of Victorian prize-fighters on the walls. The licencee knew\r\nall his customers by name, and he leaned over his bar smiling benignly\r\nat two young men who were throwing rings on a stick that stood up from\r\nthe floor: their failure was greeted with a good deal of hearty chaff\r\nfrom the rest of the company. Room was made for the new arrivals.\r\nPhilip found himself sitting between an old labourer in corduroys, with\r\nstring tied under his knees, and a shiny-faced lad of seventeen with a\r\nlove-lock neatly plastered on his red forehead. Athelny insisted on\r\ntrying his hand at the throwing of rings. He backed himself for half a\r\npint and won it. As he drank the loser\xe2\x80\x99s health he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would sooner have won this than won the Derby, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was an outlandish figure, with his wide-brimmed hat and pointed\r\nbeard, among those country folk, and it was easy to see that they\r\nthought him very queer; but his spirits were so high, his enthusiasm so\r\ncontagious, that it was impossible not to like him. Conversation went\r\neasily. A certain number of pleasantries were exchanged in the broad,\r\nslow accent of the Isle of Thanet, and there was uproarious laughter at\r\nthe sallies of the local wag. A pleasant gathering! It would have been\r\na hard-hearted person who did not feel a glow of satisfaction in his\r\nfellows. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eyes wandered out of the window where it was bright\r\nand sunny still; there were little white curtains in it tied up with\r\nred ribbon like those of a cottage window, and on the sill were pots of\r\ngeraniums. In due course one by one the idlers got up and sauntered\r\nback to the meadow where supper was cooking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready for your bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Athelny to Philip.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not used to getting up at five and staying in the open air all\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re coming to bathe with us, Uncle Phil, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d the boys\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was tired and happy. After supper, balancing himself against the\r\nwall of the hut on a chair without a back, he smoked his pipe and\r\nlooked at the night. Sally was busy. She passed in and out of the hut,\r\nand he lazily watched her methodical actions. Her walk attracted his\r\nnotice; it was not particularly graceful, but it was easy and assured;\r\nshe swung her legs from the hips, and her feet seemed to tread the\r\nearth with decision. Athelny had gone off to gossip with one of the\r\nneighbours, and presently Philip heard his wife address the world in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, I\xe2\x80\x99m out of tea and I wanted Athelny to go down to Mrs.\r\nBlack\xe2\x80\x99s and get some.\xe2\x80\x9d A pause, and then her voice was raised: \xe2\x80\x9cSally,\r\njust run down to Mrs. Black\xe2\x80\x99s and get me half a pound of tea, will you?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve run quite out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Black had a cottage about half a mile along the road, and she\r\ncombined the office of postmistress with that of universal provider.\r\nSally came out of the hut, turning down her sleeves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I come with you, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you trouble. I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid to go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you were; but it\xe2\x80\x99s getting near my bedtime, and I was\r\njust thinking I\xe2\x80\x99d like to stretch my legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally did not answer, and they set out together. The road was white and\r\nsilent. There was not a sound in the summer night. They did not speak\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite hot even now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful for the time of year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut their silence did not seem awkward. They found it was pleasant to\r\nwalk side by side and felt no need of words. Suddenly at a stile in the\r\nhedgerow they heard a low murmur of voices, and in the darkness they\r\nsaw the outline of two people. They were sitting very close to one\r\nanother and did not move as Philip and Sally passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who that was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey looked happy enough, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect they took us for lovers too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey saw the light of the cottage in front of them, and in a minute\r\nwent into the little shop. The glare dazzled them for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Black. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to shut up.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlooked at the clock. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting on for nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally asked for her half pound of tea (Mrs. Athelny could never bring\r\nherself to buy more than half a pound at a time), and they set off up\r\nthe road again. Now and then some beast of the night made a short,\r\nsharp sound, but it seemed only to make the silence more marked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe if you stood still you could hear the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally.\r\n\r\nThey strained their ears, and their fancy presented them with a faint\r\nsound of little waves lapping up against the shingle. When they passed\r\nthe stile again the lovers were still there, but now they were not\r\nspeaking; they were in one another\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and the man\xe2\x80\x99s lips were\r\npressed against the girl\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey seem busy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally.\r\n\r\nThey turned a corner, and a breath of warm wind beat for a moment\r\nagainst their faces. The earth gave forth its freshness. There was\r\nsomething strange in the tremulous night, and something, you knew not\r\nwhat, seemed to be waiting; the silence was on a sudden pregnant with\r\nmeaning. Philip had a queer feeling in his heart, it seemed very full,\r\nit seemed to melt (the hackneyed phrases expressed precisely the\r\ncurious sensation), he felt happy and anxious and expectant. To his\r\nmemory came back those lines in which Jessica and Lorenzo murmur\r\nmelodious words to one another, capping each other\xe2\x80\x99s utterance; but\r\npassion shines bright and clear through the conceits that amuse them.\r\nHe did not know what there was in the air that made his senses so\r\nstrangely alert; it seemed to him that he was pure soul to enjoy the\r\nscents and the sounds and the savours of the earth. He had never felt\r\nsuch an exquisite capacity for beauty. He was afraid that Sally by\r\nspeaking would break the spell, but she said never a word, and he\r\nwanted to hear the sound of her voice. Its low richness was the voice\r\nof the country night itself.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the field through which she had to walk to get back to\r\nthe huts. Philip went in to hold the gate open for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll say good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for coming all that way with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand, and as he took it, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were very nice you\xe2\x80\x99d kiss me good-night like the rest of the\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip had spoken in jest. He merely wanted to kiss her, because he was\r\nhappy and he liked her and the night was so lovely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a little laugh, drawing her towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nShe gave him her lips; they were warm and full and soft; he lingered a\r\nlittle, they were like a flower; then, he knew not how, without meaning\r\nit, he flung his arms round her. She yielded quite silently. Her body\r\nwas firm and strong. He felt her heart beat against his. Then he lost\r\nhis head. His senses overwhelmed him like a flood of rushing waters. He\r\ndrew her into the darker shadow of the hedge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXX\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip slept like a log and awoke with a start to find Harold tickling\r\nhis face with a feather. There was a shout of delight when he opened\r\nhis eyes. He was drunken with sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, lazybones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cSally says she won\xe2\x80\x99t wait for you\r\nunless you hurry up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he remembered what had happened. His heart sank, and, half out of\r\nbed already, he stopped; he did not know how he was going to face her;\r\nhe was overwhelmed with a sudden rush of self-reproach, and bitterly,\r\nbitterly, he regretted what he had done. What would she say to him that\r\nmorning? He dreaded meeting her, and he asked himself how he could have\r\nbeen such a fool. But the children gave him no time; Edward took his\r\nbathing-drawers and his towel, Athelstan tore the bed-clothes away; and\r\nin three minutes they all clattered down into the road. Sally gave him\r\na smile. It was as sweet and innocent as it had ever been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do take a time to dress yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was\r\nnever coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was not a particle of difference in her manner. He had expected\r\nsome change, subtle or abrupt; he fancied that there would be shame in\r\nthe way she treated him, or anger, or perhaps some increase of\r\nfamiliarity; but there was nothing. She was exactly the same as before.\r\nThey walked towards the sea all together, talking and laughing; and\r\nSally was quiet, but she was always that, reserved, but he had never\r\nseen her otherwise, and gentle. She neither sought conversation with\r\nhim nor avoided it. Philip was astounded. He had expected the incident\r\nof the night before to have caused some revolution in her, but it was\r\njust as though nothing had happened; it might have been a dream; and as\r\nhe walked along, a little girl holding on to one hand and a little boy\r\nto the other, while he chatted as unconcernedly as he could, he sought\r\nfor an explanation. He wondered whether Sally meant the affair to be\r\nforgotten. Perhaps her senses had run away with her just as his had,\r\nand, treating what had occurred as an accident due to unusual\r\ncircumstances, it might be that she had decided to put the matter out\r\nof her mind. It was ascribing to her a power of thought and a mature\r\nwisdom which fitted neither with her age nor with her character. But he\r\nrealised that he knew nothing of her. There had been in her always\r\nsomething enigmatic.\r\n\r\nThey played leap-frog in the water, and the bathe was as uproarious as\r\non the previous day. Sally mothered them all, keeping a watchful eye on\r\nthem, and calling to them when they went out too far. She swam staidly\r\nbackwards and forwards while the others got up to their larks, and now\r\nand then turned on her back to float. Presently she went out and began\r\ndrying herself; she called to the others more or less peremptorily, and\r\nat last only Philip was left in the water. He took the opportunity to\r\nhave a good hard swim. He was more used to the cold water this second\r\nmorning, and he revelled in its salt freshness; it rejoiced him to use\r\nhis limbs freely, and he covered the water with long, firm strokes. But\r\nSally, with a towel round her, went down to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re to come out this minute, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she called, as though he were\r\na small boy under her charge.\r\n\r\nAnd when, smiling with amusement at her authoritative way, he came\r\ntowards her, she upbraided him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is naughty of you to stay in so long. Your lips are quite blue, and\r\njust look at your teeth, they\xe2\x80\x99re chattering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had never talked to him in that manner before. It was as though\r\nwhat had happened gave her a sort of right over him, and she looked\r\nupon him as a child to be cared for. In a few minutes they were\r\ndressed, and they started to walk back. Sally noticed his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look, they\xe2\x80\x99re quite blue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right. It\xe2\x80\x99s only the circulation. I shall get the blood\r\nback in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took his hands in hers and rubbed them, first one and then the\r\nother, till the colour returned. Philip, touched and puzzled, watched\r\nher. He could not say anything to her on account of the children, and\r\nhe did not meet her eyes; but he was sure they did not avoid his\r\npurposely, it just happened that they did not meet. And during the day\r\nthere was nothing in her behaviour to suggest a consciousness in her\r\nthat anything had passed between them. Perhaps she was a little more\r\ntalkative than usual. When they were all sitting again in the hop-field\r\nshe told her mother how naughty Philip had been in not coming out of\r\nthe water till he was blue with cold. It was incredible, and yet it\r\nseemed that the only effect of the incident of the night before was to\r\narouse in her a feeling of protection towards him: she had the same\r\ninstinctive desire to mother him as she had with regard to her brothers\r\nand sisters.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the evening that he found himself alone with her. She\r\nwas cooking the supper, and Philip was sitting on the grass by the side\r\nof the fire. Mrs. Athelny had gone down to the village to do some\r\nshopping, and the children were scattered in various pursuits of their\r\nown. Philip hesitated to speak. He was very nervous. Sally attended to\r\nher business with serene competence and she accepted placidly the\r\nsilence which to him was so embarrassing. He did not know how to begin.\r\nSally seldom spoke unless she was spoken to or had something particular\r\nto say. At last he could not bear it any longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not angry with me, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d he blurted out suddenly.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes quietly and looked at him without emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe? No. Why should I be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was taken aback and did not reply. She took the lid off the pot,\r\nstirred the contents, and put it on again. A savoury smell spread over\r\nthe air. She looked at him once more, with a quiet smile which barely\r\nseparated her lips; it was more a smile of the eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always liked you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHis heart gave a great thump against his ribs, and he felt the blood\r\nrushing to his cheeks. He forced a faint laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re a silly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you liked me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t either.\xe2\x80\x9d She put a little more wood on the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew I\r\nliked you that day you came when you\xe2\x80\x99d been sleeping out and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had\r\nanything to eat, d\xe2\x80\x99you remember? And me and mother, we got Thorpy\xe2\x80\x99s bed\r\nready for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flushed again, for he did not know that she was aware of that\r\nincident. He remembered it himself with horror and shame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with the others. You\r\nremember that young fellow mother wanted me to have? I let him come to\r\ntea because he bothered so, but I knew I\xe2\x80\x99d say no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was so surprised that he found nothing to say. There was a queer\r\nfeeling in his heart; he did not know what it was, unless it was\r\nhappiness. Sally stirred the pot once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish those children would make haste and come. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got to. Supper\xe2\x80\x99s ready now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go and see if I can find them?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to talk about practical things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bad idea, I must say\xe2\x80\xa6. There\xe2\x80\x99s mother coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as he got up, she looked at him without embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I come for a walk with you tonight when I\xe2\x80\x99ve put the children to\r\nbed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you wait for me down by the stile, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come when I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited under the stars, sitting on the stile, and the hedges with\r\ntheir ripening blackberries were high on each side of him. From the\r\nearth rose rich scents of the night, and the air was soft and still.\r\nHis heart was beating madly. He could not understand anything of what\r\nhappened to him. He associated passion with cries and tears and\r\nvehemence, and there was nothing of this in Sally; but he did not know\r\nwhat else but passion could have caused her to give herself. But\r\npassion for him? He would not have been surprised if she had fallen to\r\nher cousin, Peter Gann, tall, spare, and straight, with his sunburned\r\nface and long, easy stride. Philip wondered what she saw in him. He did\r\nnot know if she loved him as he reckoned love. And yet? He was\r\nconvinced of her purity. He had a vague inkling that many things had\r\ncombined, things that she felt though was unconscious of, the\r\nintoxication of the air and the hops and the night, the healthy\r\ninstincts of the natural woman, a tenderness that overflowed, and an\r\naffection that had in it something maternal and something sisterly; and\r\nshe gave all she had to give because her heart was full of charity.\r\n\r\nHe heard a step on the road, and a figure came out of the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSally,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nShe stopped and came to the stile, and with her came sweet, clean\r\nodours of the country-side. She seemed to carry with her scents of the\r\nnew-mown hay, and the savour of ripe hops, and the freshness of young\r\ngrass. Her lips were soft and full against his, and her lovely, strong\r\nbody was firm within his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMilk and honey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re like milk and honey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made her close her eyes and kissed her eyelids, first one and then\r\nthe other. Her arm, strong and muscular, was bare to the elbow; he\r\npassed his hand over it and wondered at its beauty; it gleamed in the\r\ndarkness; she had the skin that Rubens painted, astonishingly fair and\r\ntransparent, and on one side were little golden hairs. It was the arm\r\nof a Saxon goddess; but no immortal had that exquisite, homely\r\nnaturalness; and Philip thought of a cottage garden with the dear\r\nflowers which bloom in all men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts, of the hollyhock and the red\r\nand white rose which is called York and Lancaster, and of\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94in-a-mist and Sweet William, and honeysuckle, larkspur, and London\r\nPride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you care for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m insignificant and crippled and\r\nordinary and ugly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took his face in both her hands and kissed his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re an old silly, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the hops were picked, Philip with the news in his pocket that he\r\nhad got the appointment as assistant house-physician at St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\naccompanied the Athelnys back to London. He took modest rooms in\r\nWestminster and at the beginning of October entered upon his duties.\r\nThe work was interesting and varied; every day he learned something\r\nnew; he felt himself of some consequence; and he saw a good deal of\r\nSally. He found life uncommonly pleasant. He was free about six, except\r\non the days on which he had out-patients, and then he went to the shop\r\nat which Sally worked to meet her when she came out. There were several\r\nyoung men, who hung about opposite the \xe2\x80\x98trade entrance\xe2\x80\x99 or a little\r\nfurther along, at the first corner; and the girls, coming out two and\r\ntwo or in little groups, nudged one another and giggled as they\r\nrecognised them. Sally in her plain black dress looked very different\r\nfrom the country lass who had picked hops side by side with him. She\r\nwalked away from the shop quickly, but she slackened her pace when they\r\nmet, and greeted him with her quiet smile. They walked together through\r\nthe busy street. He talked to her of his work at the hospital, and she\r\ntold him what she had been doing in the shop that day. He came to know\r\nthe names of the girls she worked with. He found that Sally had a\r\nrestrained, but keen, sense of the ridiculous, and she made remarks\r\nabout the girls or the men who were set over them which amused him by\r\ntheir unexpected drollery. She had a way of saying a thing which was\r\nvery characteristic, quite gravely, as though there were nothing funny\r\nin it at all, and yet it was so sharp-sighted that Philip broke into\r\ndelighted laughter. Then she would give him a little glance in which\r\nthe smiling eyes showed she was not unaware of her own humour. They met\r\nwith a handshake and parted as formally. Once Philip asked her to come\r\nand have tea with him in his rooms, but she refused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do that. It would look funny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever a word of love passed between them. She seemed not to desire\r\nanything more than the companionship of those walks. Yet Philip was\r\npositive that she was glad to be with him. She puzzled him as much as\r\nshe had done at the beginning. He did not begin to understand her\r\nconduct; but the more he knew her the fonder he grew of her; she was\r\ncompetent and self controlled, and there was a charming honesty in her:\r\nyou felt that you could rely upon her in every circumstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an awfully good sort,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her once a propos of nothing\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect I\xe2\x80\x99m just the same as everyone else,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he did not love her. It was a great affection that he felt\r\nfor her, and he liked her company; it was curiously soothing; and he\r\nhad a feeling for her which seemed to him ridiculous to entertain\r\ntowards a shop-girl of nineteen: he respected her. And he admired her\r\nmagnificent healthiness. She was a splendid animal, without defect; and\r\nphysical perfection filled him always with admiring awe. She made him\r\nfeel unworthy.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, about three weeks after they had come back to London as\r\nthey walked together, he noticed that she was unusually silent. The\r\nserenity of her expression was altered by a slight line between the\r\neyebrows: it was the beginning of a frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe did not look at him, but straight in front of her, and her colour\r\ndarkened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe understood at once what she meant. His heart gave a sudden, quick\r\nbeat, and he felt the colour leave his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean? Are you afraid that\xe2\x80\xa6 ?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. He could not go on. The possibility that anything of the\r\nsort could happen had never crossed his mind. Then he saw that her lips\r\nwere trembling, and she was trying not to cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not certain yet. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence till they came to the corner of Chancery\r\nLane, where he always left her. She held out her hand and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it yet. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked away with a tumult of thoughts in his head. What a fool he\r\nhad been! That was the first thing that struck him, an abject,\r\nmiserable fool, and he repeated it to himself a dozen times in a rush\r\nof angry feeling. He despised himself. How could he have got into such\r\na mess? But at the same time, for his thoughts chased one another\r\nthrough his brain and yet seemed to stand together, in a hopeless\r\nconfusion, like the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle seen in a nightmare, he\r\nasked himself what he was going to do. Everything was so clear before\r\nhim, all he had aimed at so long within reach at last, and now his\r\ninconceivable stupidity had erected this new obstacle. Philip had never\r\nbeen able to surmount what he acknowledged was a defect in his resolute\r\ndesire for a well ordered life, and that was his passion for living in\r\nthe future; and no sooner was he settled in his work at the hospital\r\nthan he had busied himself with arrangements for his travels. In the\r\npast he had often tried not to think too circumstantially of his plans\r\nfor the future, it was only discouraging; but now that his goal was so\r\nnear he saw no harm in giving away to a longing that was so difficult\r\nto resist. First of all he meant to go to Spain. That was the land of\r\nhis heart; and by now he was imbued with its spirit, its romance and\r\ncolour and history and grandeur; he felt that it had a message for him\r\nin particular which no other country could give. He knew the fine old\r\ncities already as though he had trodden their tortuous streets from\r\nchildhood. Cordova, Seville, Toledo, Leon, Tarragona, Burgos. The great\r\npainters of Spain were the painters of his soul, and his pulse beat\r\nquickly as he pictured his ecstasy on standing face to face with those\r\nworks which were more significant than any others to his own tortured,\r\nrestless heart. He had read the great poets, more characteristic of\r\ntheir race than the poets of other lands; for they seemed to have drawn\r\ntheir inspiration not at all from the general currents of the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nliterature but directly from the torrid, scented plains and the bleak\r\nmountains of their country. A few short months now, and he would hear\r\nwith his own ears all around him the language which seemed most apt for\r\ngrandeur of soul and passion. His fine taste had given him an inkling\r\nthat Andalusia was too soft and sensuous, a little vulgar even, to\r\nsatisfy his ardour; and his imagination dwelt more willingly among the\r\nwind-swept distances of Castile and the rugged magnificence of Aragon\r\nand Leon. He did not know quite what those unknown contacts would give\r\nhim, but he felt that he would gather from them a strength and a\r\npurpose which would make him more capable of affronting and\r\ncomprehending the manifold wonders of places more distant and more\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\nFor this was only a beginning. He had got into communication with the\r\nvarious companies which took surgeons out on their ships, and knew\r\nexactly what were their routes, and from men who had been on them what\r\nwere the advantages and disadvantages of each line. He put aside the\r\nOrient and the P. & O. It was difficult to get a berth with them; and\r\nbesides their passenger traffic allowed the medical officer little\r\nfreedom; but there were other services which sent large tramps on\r\nleisurely expeditions to the East, stopping at all sorts of ports for\r\nvarious periods, from a day or two to a fortnight, so that you had\r\nplenty of time, and it was often possible to make a trip inland. The\r\npay was poor and the food no more than adequate, so that there was not\r\nmuch demand for the posts, and a man with a London degree was pretty\r\nsure to get one if he applied. Since there were no passengers other\r\nthan a casual man or so, shipping on business from some out-of-the-way\r\nport to another, the life on board was friendly and pleasant. Philip\r\nknew by heart the list of places at which they touched; and each one\r\ncalled up in him visions of tropical sunshine, and magic colour, and of\r\na teeming, mysterious, intense life. Life! That was what he wanted. At\r\nlast he would come to close quarters with Life. And perhaps, from Tokyo\r\nor Shanghai it would be possible to tranship into some other line and\r\ndrip down to the islands of the South Pacific. A doctor was useful\r\nanywhere. There might be an opportunity to go up country in Burmah, and\r\nwhat rich jungles in Sumatra or Borneo might he not visit? He was young\r\nstill and time was no object to him. He had no ties in England, no\r\nfriends; he could go up and down the world for years, learning the\r\nbeauty and the wonder and the variedness of life.\r\n\r\nNow this thing had come. He put aside the possibility that Sally was\r\nmistaken; he felt strangely certain that she was right; after all, it\r\nwas so likely; anyone could see that Nature had built her to be the\r\nmother of children. He knew what he ought to do. He ought not to let\r\nthe incident divert him a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth from his path. He thought of\r\nGriffiths; he could easily imagine with what indifference that young\r\nman would have received such a piece of news; he would have thought it\r\nan awful nuisance and would at once have taken to his heels, like a\r\nwise fellow; he would have left the girl to deal with her troubles as\r\nbest she could. Philip told himself that if this had happened it was\r\nbecause it was inevitable. He was no more to blame than Sally; she was\r\na girl who knew the world and the facts of life, and she had taken the\r\nrisk with her eyes open. It would be madness to allow such an accident\r\nto disturb the whole pattern of his life. He was one of the few people\r\nwho was acutely conscious of the transitoriness of life, and how\r\nnecessary it was to make the most of it. He would do what he could for\r\nSally; he could afford to give her a sufficient sum of money. A strong\r\nman would never allow himself to be turned from his purpose.\r\n\r\nPhilip said all this to himself, but he knew he could not do it. He\r\nsimply could not. He knew himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so damned weak,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered despairingly.\r\n\r\nShe had trusted him and been kind to him. He simply could not do a\r\nthing which, notwithstanding all his reason, he felt was horrible. He\r\nknew he would have no peace on his travels if he had the thought\r\nconstantly with him that she was wretched. Besides, there were her\r\nfather and mother: they had always treated him well; it was not\r\npossible to repay them with ingratitude. The only thing was to marry\r\nSally as quickly as possible. He would write to Doctor South, tell him\r\nhe was going to be married at once, and say that if his offer still\r\nheld he was willing to accept it. That sort of practice, among poor\r\npeople, was the only one possible for him; there his deformity did not\r\nmatter, and they would not sneer at the simple manners of his wife. It\r\nwas curious to think of her as his wife, it gave him a queer, soft\r\nfeeling; and a wave of emotion spread over him as he thought of the\r\nchild which was his. He had little doubt that Doctor South would be\r\nglad to have him, and he pictured to himself the life he would lead\r\nwith Sally in the fishing village. They would have a little house\r\nwithin sight of the sea, and he would watch the mighty ships passing to\r\nthe lands he would never know. Perhaps that was the wisest thing.\r\nCronshaw had told him that the facts of life mattered nothing to him\r\nwho by the power of fancy held in fee the twin realms of space and\r\ntime. It was true. Forever wilt thou love and she be fair!\r\n\r\nHis wedding present to his wife would be all his high hopes.\r\nSelf-sacrifice! Philip was uplifted by its beauty, and all through the\r\nevening he thought of it. He was so excited that he could not read. He\r\nseemed to be driven out of his rooms into the streets, and he walked up\r\nand down Birdcage Walk, his heart throbbing with joy. He could hardly\r\nbear his impatience. He wanted to see Sally\xe2\x80\x99s happiness when he made\r\nher his offer, and if it had not been so late he would have gone to her\r\nthere and then. He pictured to himself the long evenings he would spend\r\nwith Sally in the cosy sitting-room, the blinds undrawn so that they\r\ncould watch the sea; he with his books, while she bent over her work,\r\nand the shaded lamp made her sweet face more fair. They would talk over\r\nthe growing child, and when she turned her eyes to his there was in\r\nthem the light of love. And the fishermen and their wives who were his\r\npatients would come to feel a great affection for them, and they in\r\ntheir turn would enter into the pleasures and pains of those simple\r\nlives. But his thoughts returned to the son who would be his and hers.\r\nAlready he felt in himself a passionate devotion to it. He thought of\r\npassing his hands over his little perfect limbs, he knew he would be\r\nbeautiful; and he would make over to him all his dreams of a rich and\r\nvaried life. And thinking over the long pilgrimage of his past he\r\naccepted it joyfully. He accepted the deformity which had made life so\r\nhard for him; he knew that it had warped his character, but now he saw\r\nalso that by reason of it he had acquired that power of introspection\r\nwhich had given him so much delight. Without it he would never have had\r\nhis keen appreciation of beauty, his passion for art and literature,\r\nand his interest in the varied spectacle of life. The ridicule and the\r\ncontempt which had so often been heaped upon him had turned his mind\r\ninward and called forth those flowers which he felt would never lose\r\ntheir fragrance. Then he saw that the normal was the rarest thing in\r\nthe world. Everyone had some defect, of body or of mind: he thought of\r\nall the people he had known (the whole world was like a sick-house, and\r\nthere was no rhyme or reason in it), he saw a long procession, deformed\r\nin body and warped in mind, some with illness of the flesh, weak hearts\r\nor weak lungs, and some with illness of the spirit, languor of will, or\r\na craving for liquor. At this moment he could feel a holy compassion\r\nfor them all. They were the helpless instruments of blind chance. He\r\ncould pardon Griffiths for his treachery and Mildred for the pain she\r\nhad caused him. They could not help themselves. The only reasonable\r\nthing was to accept the good of men and be patient with their faults.\r\nThe words of the dying God crossed his memory:\r\n\r\nForgive them, for they know not what they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had arranged to meet Sally on Saturday in the National Gallery. She\r\nwas to come there as soon as she was released from the shop and had\r\nagreed to lunch with him. Two days had passed since he had seen her,\r\nand his exultation had not left him for a moment. It was because he\r\nrejoiced in the feeling that he had not attempted to see her. He had\r\nrepeated to himself exactly what he would say to her and how he should\r\nsay it. Now his impatience was unbearable. He had written to Doctor\r\nSouth and had in his pocket a telegram from him received that morning:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSacking the mumpish fool. When will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip walked along\r\nParliament Street. It was a fine day, and there was a bright, frosty\r\nsun which made the light dance in the street. It was crowded. There was\r\na tenuous mist in the distance, and it softened exquisitely the noble\r\nlines of the buildings. He crossed Trafalgar Square. Suddenly his heart\r\ngave a sort of twist in his body; he saw a woman in front of him who he\r\nthought was Mildred. She had the same figure, and she walked with that\r\nslight dragging of the feet which was so characteristic of her. Without\r\nthinking, but with a beating heart, he hurried till he came alongside,\r\nand then, when the woman turned, he saw it was someone unknown to him.\r\nIt was the face of a much older person, with a lined, yellow skin. He\r\nslackened his pace. He was infinitely relieved, but it was not only\r\nrelief that he felt; it was disappointment too; he was seized with\r\nhorror of himself. Would he never be free from that passion? At the\r\nbottom of his heart, notwithstanding everything, he felt that a\r\nstrange, desperate thirst for that vile woman would always linger. That\r\nlove had caused him so much suffering that he knew he would never,\r\nnever quite be free of it. Only death could finally assuage his desire.\r\n\r\nBut he wrenched the pang from his heart. He thought of Sally, with her\r\nkind blue eyes; and his lips unconsciously formed themselves into a\r\nsmile. He walked up the steps of the National Gallery and sat down in\r\nthe first room, so that he should see her the moment she came in. It\r\nalways comforted him to get among pictures. He looked at none in\r\nparticular, but allowed the magnificence of their colour, the beauty of\r\ntheir lines, to work upon his soul. His imagination was busy with\r\nSally. It would be pleasant to take her away from that London in which\r\nshe seemed an unusual figure, like a cornflower in a shop among orchids\r\nand azaleas; he had learned in the Kentish hop-field that she did not\r\nbelong to the town; and he was sure that she would blossom under the\r\nsoft skies of Dorset to a rarer beauty. She came in, and he got up to\r\nmeet her. She was in black, with white cuffs at her wrists and a lawn\r\ncollar round her neck. They shook hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been waiting long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Ten minutes. Are you hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s sit here for a bit, shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat quietly, side by side, without speaking. Philip enjoyed having\r\nher near him. He was warmed by her radiant health. A glow of life\r\nseemed like an aureole to shine about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, with a little smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. It was a false alarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary sensation filled him. He had felt certain that Sally\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicion was well-founded; it had never occurred to him for an instant\r\nthat there was a possibility of error. All his plans were suddenly\r\noverthrown, and the existence, so elaborately pictured, was no more\r\nthan a dream which would never be realised. He was free once more.\r\nFree! He need give up none of his projects, and life still was in his\r\nhands for him to do what he liked with. He felt no exhilaration, but\r\nonly dismay. His heart sank. The future stretched out before him in\r\ndesolate emptiness. It was as though he had sailed for many years over\r\na great waste of waters, with peril and privation, and at last had come\r\nupon a fair haven, but as he was about to enter, some contrary wind had\r\narisen and drove him out again into the open sea; and because he had\r\nlet his mind dwell on these soft meads and pleasant woods of the land,\r\nthe vast deserts of the ocean filled him with anguish. He could not\r\nconfront again the loneliness and the tempest. Sally looked at him with\r\nher clear eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked again. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be as pleased as\r\nPunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe met her gaze haggardly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are funny. Most men would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe realised that he had deceived himself; it was no self-sacrifice that\r\nhad driven him to think of marrying, but the desire for a wife and a\r\nhome and love; and now that it all seemed to slip through his fingers\r\nhe was seized with despair. He wanted all that more than anything in\r\nthe world. What did he care for Spain and its cities, Cordova, Toledo,\r\nLeon; what to him were the pagodas of Burmah and the lagoons of South\r\nSea Islands? America was here and now. It seemed to him that all his\r\nlife he had followed the ideals that other people, by their words or\r\ntheir writings, had instilled into him, and never the desires of his\r\nown heart. Always his course had been swayed by what he thought he\r\nshould do and never by what he wanted with his whole soul to do. He put\r\nall that aside now with a gesture of impatience. He had lived always in\r\nthe future, and the present always, always had slipped through his\r\nfingers. His ideals? He thought of his desire to make a design,\r\nintricate and beautiful, out of the myriad, meaningless facts of life:\r\nhad he not seen also that the simplest pattern, that in which a man was\r\nborn, worked, married, had children, and died, was likewise the most\r\nperfect? It might be that to surrender to happiness was to accept\r\ndefeat, but it was a defeat better than many victories.\r\n\r\nHe glanced quickly at Sally, he wondered what she was thinking, and\r\nthen looked away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to ask you to marry me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought p\xe2\x80\x99raps you might, but I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have liked to stand in\r\nyour way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about your travels, Spain and all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you know I want to travel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to know something about it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you and Dad talk about\r\nit till you were blue in the face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn about all that.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused for an instant and then\r\nspoke in a low, hoarse whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you! I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nleave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. He could not tell what she thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry me, Sally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not move and there was no flicker of emotion on her face, but\r\nshe did not look at him when she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have a house of my own, and it\xe2\x80\x99s about time\r\nI was settling down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled a little. He knew her pretty well by now, and her manner did\r\nnot surprise him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to marry ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no one else I would marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that settles it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother and Dad will be surprised, won\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want my lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled and took her hand and pressed it. They got up and walked out\r\nof the gallery. They stood for a moment at the balustrade and looked at\r\nTrafalgar Square. Cabs and omnibuses hurried to and fro, and crowds\r\npassed, hastening in every direction, and the sun was shining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF HUMAN BONDAGE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
