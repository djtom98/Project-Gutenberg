The passage is this.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment is there one of us present, however we may have\r\n    departed from the Lord, disobeyed his will, and disregarded his\r\n    word--is there one of us who would, at this moment, accept all that\r\n    man could bestow, or earth afford, to resign the hope of his\r\n    salvation?--No, there is not one--not such a fool on earth, were the\r\n    enemy of mankind to traverse it with the offer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis passage suggested the idea of \xe2\x80\x9cMelmoth the Wanderer.\xe2\x80\x9d The Reader\r\nwill find that idea developed in the following pages, with what power or\r\nsuccess _he_ is to decide.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cSpaniard\xe2\x80\x99s Tale\xe2\x80\x9d has been censured by a friend to whom I read it,\r\nas containing too much attempt at the revivification of the horrors of\r\nRadcliffe-Romance, of the persecutions of convents, and the terrors of\r\nthe Inquisition.\r\n\r\nI defended myself, by trying to point out to my friend, that I had made\r\nthe misery of conventual life depend less on the startling adventures\r\none meets with in romances, than on that irritating series of petty\r\ntorments which constitutes the misery of life in general, and which,\r\namid the tideless stagnation of monastic existence, solitude gives its\r\ninmates leisure to invent, and power combined with malignity, the full\r\ndisposition to practise. I trust this defence will operate more on the\r\nconviction of the Reader, than it did on that of my friend.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the Romance, there are some parts of it which I have\r\nborrowed from real life.\r\n\r\nThe story of John Sandal and Elinor Mortimer is founded in fact.\r\n\r\nThe original from which the Wife of Walberg is imperfectly sketched is a\r\nliving woman, and _long may she live_.\r\n\r\nI cannot again appear before the public in so unseemly a character as\r\nthat of a writer of romances, without regretting the necessity that\r\ncompels me to it. Did my profession furnish me with the means of\r\nsubsistence, I should hold myself culpable indeed in having recourse to\r\nany other, but--am I allowed the choice?\r\n\r\n       Dublin,      }\r\n  31st August 1820. }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMELMOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    Alive again? Then show me where he is;\r\n    I\xe2\x80\x99ll give a thousand pounds to look upon him.\r\n\r\n    SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1816, John Melmoth, a student in Trinity College,\r\nDublin, quitted it to attend a dying uncle on whom his hopes for\r\nindependence chiefly rested. John was the orphan son of a younger\r\nbrother, whose small property scarce could pay John\xe2\x80\x99s college expences;\r\nbut the uncle was rich, unmarried, and old; and John, from his infancy,\r\nhad been brought up to look on him with that mingled sensation of awe,\r\nand of the wish, without the means to conciliate, (that sensation at\r\nonce attractive and repulsive), with which we regard a being who (as\r\nnurse, domestic, and parent have tutored us to believe) holds the very\r\nthreads of our existence in his hands, and may prolong or snap them when\r\nhe pleases.\r\n\r\nOn receiving this summons, John set immediately out to attend his uncle.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the country through which he travelled (it was the county\r\nWicklow) could not prevent his mind from dwelling on many painful\r\nthoughts, some borrowed from the past, and more from the future. His\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s caprice and moroseness,--the strange reports concerning the\r\ncause of the secluded life he had led for many years,--his own dependent\r\nstate,--fell like blows fast and heavy on his mind. He roused himself to\r\nrepel them,--sat up in the mail, in which he was a solitary\r\npassenger,--looked out on the prospect,--consulted his watch;--then he\r\nthought they receded for a moment,--but there was nothing to fill their\r\nplace, and he was forced to invite them back for company. When the mind\r\nis thus active in calling over invaders, no wonder the conquest is soon\r\ncompleted. As the carriage drew near the Lodge, (the name of old\r\nMelmoth\xe2\x80\x99s seat), John\xe2\x80\x99s heart grew heavier every moment.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of this awful uncle from infancy,--when he was never\r\npermitted to approach him without innumerable lectures,--_not to be\r\ntroublesome_,--not to go too near his uncle,--not to ask him any\r\nquestions,--on no account to disturb the inviolable arrangement of his\r\nsnuff-box, hand-bell, and spectacles, nor to suffer the glittering of\r\nthe gold-headed cane to tempt him to the mortal sin of handling\r\nit,--and, finally, to pilot himself aright through his perilous course\r\nin and out of the apartment without striking against the piles of books,\r\nglobes, old newspapers, wig-blocks, tobacco-pipes, and snuff-cannisters,\r\nnot to mention certain hidden rocks of rat-traps and mouldy books\r\nbeneath the chairs,--together with the final reverential bow at the\r\ndoor, which was to be closed with cautious gentleness, and the stairs to\r\nbe descended as if he were \xe2\x80\x9cshod with felt.\xe2\x80\x9d--This recollection was\r\ncarried on to his school-boy years, when at Christmas and Easter, the\r\nragged poney, the jest of the school, was dispatched to bring the\r\nreluctant visitor to the Lodge,--where his pastime was to sit vis-a-vis\r\nto his uncle, without speaking or moving, till the pair resembled Don\r\nRaymond and the ghost of Beatrice in the Monk,--then watching him as he\r\npicked the bones of lean mutton out of his mess of weak broth, the\r\nlatter of which he handed to his nephew with a needless caution not to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctake more than he liked,\xe2\x80\x9d--then hurried to bed by day-light, even in\r\nwinter, to save the expence of an inch of candle, where he lay awake and\r\nrestless from hunger, till his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s retiring at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock gave\r\nsignal to the governante of the meagre household to steal up to him with\r\nsome fragments of her own scanty meal, administering between every\r\nmouthful a whispered caution not to tell his uncle. Then his college\r\nlife, passed in an attic in the second square, uncheered by an\r\ninvitation to the country; the gloomy summer wasted in walking up and\r\ndown the deserted streets, as his uncle would not defray the expences of\r\nhis journey;--the only intimation of his existence, received in\r\nquarterly epistles, containing, with the scanty but punctual remittance,\r\ncomplaints of the expences of his education, cautions against\r\nextravagance, and lamentations for the failure of tenants and the fall\r\nof the value of lands. All these recollections came over him, and along\r\nwith them the remembrance of that last scene, where his dependence on\r\nhis uncle was impressed on him by the dying lips of his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, I must leave you, my poor boy; it has pleased God to take your\r\nfather from you before he could do for you what would have made this\r\nhour less painful to him. You must look up, John, to your uncle for\r\nevery thing. He has oddities and infirmities, but you must learn to bear\r\nwith them, and with many other things too, as you will learn too soon.\r\nAnd now, my poor boy, may He who is the father of the fatherless look on\r\nyour desolate state, and give you favour in the eyes of your uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d As\r\nthis scene rose to John\xe2\x80\x99s memory, his eyes filled fast with tears, which\r\nhe hastened to wipe away as the carriage stopt to let him out at his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s gate.\r\n\r\nHe alighted, and with a change of linen in a handkerchief, (his only\r\ntravelling equipment), he approached his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s gate. The lodge was in\r\nruins, and a barefooted boy from an adjacent cabin ran to lift on its\r\nsingle hinge what had once been a gate, but was now a few planks so\r\nvillainously put together, that they clattered like a sign in a high\r\nwind. The stubborn post of the gate, yielding at last to the united\r\nstrength of John and his barefooted assistant, grated heavily through\r\nthe mud and gravel stones, in which it left a deep and sloughy furrow,\r\nand the entrance lay open. John, after searching his pocket in vain for\r\na trifle to reward his assistant, pursued his way, while the lad, on his\r\nreturn, cleared the road at a hop step and jump, plunging through the\r\nmud with all the dabbling and amphibious delight of a duck, and scarce\r\nless proud of his agility than of his \xe2\x80\x9csarving a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d As John\r\nslowly trod the miry road which had once been the approach, he could\r\ndiscover, by the dim light of an autumnal evening, signs of increasing\r\ndesolation since he had last visited the spot,--signs that penury had\r\nbeen aggravated and sharpened into downright misery. There was not a\r\nfence or a hedge round the domain: an uncemented wall of loose stones,\r\nwhose numerous gaps were filled with furze or thorns, supplied their\r\nplace. There was not a tree or shrub on the lawn; the lawn itself was\r\nturned into pasture-ground, and a few sheep were picking their scanty\r\nfood amid the pebble-stones, thistles, and hard mould, through which a\r\nfew blades of grass made their rare and squalid appearance.\r\n\r\nThe house itself stood strongly defined even amid the darkness of the\r\nevening sky; for there were neither wings, or offices, or shrubbery, or\r\ntree, to shade or support it, and soften its strong harsh outline. John,\r\nafter a melancholy gaze at the grass-grown steps and boarded windows,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9caddressed himself\xe2\x80\x9d to knock at the door; but knocker there was none:\r\nloose stones, however, there were in plenty; and John was making\r\nvigorous application to the door with one of them, till the furious\r\nbarking of a mastiff, who threatened at every bound to break his chain,\r\nand whose yell and growl, accompanied by \xe2\x80\x9ceyes that glow and fangs that\r\ngrin,\xe2\x80\x9d savoured as much of hunger as of rage, made the assailant raise\r\nthe siege on the door, and betake himself to a well-known passage that\r\nled to the kitchen. A light glimmered in the window as he approached: he\r\nraised the latch with a doubtful hand; but, when he saw the party\r\nwithin, he advanced with the step of a man no longer doubtful of his\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nRound a turf-fire, whose well-replenished fuel gave testimony to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmaster\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d indisposition, who would probably as soon have been placed on\r\nthe fire himself as seen the whole _kish_ emptied on it once, were\r\nseated the old housekeeper, two or three _followers_, (_i.\xc2\xa0e._ people\r\nwho ate, drank, and lounged about in any kitchen that was open in the\r\nneighbourhood, on an occasion of grief or joy, all for his honor\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nand for the great rispict they bore the family), and an old woman, whom\r\nJohn immediately recognized as the doctress of the neighbourhood,--a\r\nwithered Sybil, who prolonged her squalid existence by practising on the\r\nfears, the ignorance, and the sufferings of beings as miserable as\r\nherself. Among the better sort, to whom she sometimes had access by the\r\ninfluence of servants, she tried the effects of some simples, her skill\r\nin which was sometimes productive of success. Among the lower orders she\r\ntalked much of the effects of the \xe2\x80\x9cevil eye,\xe2\x80\x9d against which she boasted\r\na counter-spell, of unfailing efficacy; and while she spoke, she shook\r\nher grizzled locks with such witch-like eagerness, that she never failed\r\nto communicate to her half-terrified, half-believing audience, some\r\nportion of that enthusiasm which, amid all her consciousness of\r\nimposture, she herself probably felt a large share of; still, when the\r\ncase at last became desperate, when credulity itself lost all patience,\r\nand hope and life were departing together, she urged the miserable\r\npatient to confess \xe2\x80\x9c_there was something about his heart_;\xe2\x80\x9d and when\r\nthis confession was extorted from the weariness of pain and the\r\nignorance of poverty, she nodded and muttered so mysteriously, as to\r\nconvey to the bystanders, that she had had difficulties to contend with\r\nwhich were invincible by human power. When there was no pretext, from\r\nindisposition, for her visiting either \xe2\x80\x9chis honor\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d kitchen, or the\r\ncottar\xe2\x80\x99s hut,--when the stubborn and persevering convalescence of the\r\nwhole country threatened her with starvation,--she still had a\r\nresource:--if there were no lives to be shortened, there were fortunes\r\nto be told;--she worked \xe2\x80\x9cby spells, and by such daubry as is beyond our\r\nelement.\xe2\x80\x9d No one twined so well as she the mystic yarn to be dropt into\r\nthe lime-kiln pit, on the edge of which stood the shivering inquirer\r\ninto futurity, doubtful whether the answer to her question of \xe2\x80\x9cwho\r\nholds?\xe2\x80\x9d was to be uttered by the voice of demon or lover.\r\n\r\nNo one knew so well as she to find where the four streams met, in which,\r\non the same portentous season, the chemise was to be immersed, and then\r\ndisplayed before the fire, (in the name of one whom we dare not mention\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cears polite\xe2\x80\x9d), to be turned by the figure of the destined husband\r\nbefore morning. No one but herself (she said) knew the hand in which the\r\ncomb was to be held, while the other was employed in conveying the apple\r\nto the mouth,--while, during the joint operation, the shadow of the\r\nphantom-spouse was to pass across the mirror before which it was\r\nperformed. No one was more skilful or active in removing every iron\r\nimplement from the kitchen where these ceremonies were usually performed\r\nby the credulous and terrified dupes of her wizardry, lest, instead of\r\nthe form of a comely youth exhibiting a ring on his white finger, an\r\nheadless figure should stalk to the rack, (_Anglic\xc3\xa8_, dresser), take\r\ndown a long spit, or, in default of that, snatch a poker from the\r\nfire-side, and mercilessly take measure with its iron length of the\r\nsleeper for a coffin. No one, in short, knew better how to torment or\r\nterrify her victims into a belief of that power which may and has\r\nreduced the strongest minds to the level of the weakest; and under the\r\ninfluence of which the cultivated sceptic, Lord Lyttleton, yelled and\r\ngnashed and writhed in his last hours, like the poor girl who, in the\r\nbelief of the horrible visitation of the vampire, shrieked aloud, that\r\nher grandfather was sucking her vital blood while she slept, and expired\r\nunder the influence of imaginary horror. Such was the being to whom old\r\nMelmoth had committed his life, half from credulity, and (_Hibernic\xc3\xa8_\r\nspeaking) _more than half_ from avarice. Among this groupe John\r\nadvanced,--recognising some,--disliking more,--distrusting all. The old\r\nhousekeeper received him with cordiality;--he was always her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhiteheaded boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,--(_imprimis_, his hair was as black as\r\njet), and she tried to lift her withered hand to his head with an action\r\nbetween a benediction and a caress, till the difficulty of the attempt\r\nforced on her the conviction that that head was fourteen inches higher\r\nthan her reach since she had last patted it. The men, with the national\r\ndeference of the Irish to a person of superior rank, all rose at his\r\napproach, (their stools chattering on the broken flags) and wished his\r\nhonor \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand years and long life to the back of that; and would not\r\nhis honor take something to keep the grief out of his heart;\xe2\x80\x9d and so\r\nsaying, five or six red and bony hands tendered him glasses of whiskey\r\nall at once. All this time the Sybil sat silent in the ample\r\nchimney-corner, sending redoubled whiffs out of her pipe. John gently\r\ndeclined the offer of spirits, received the attentions of the old\r\nhousekeeper cordially, looked askance at the withered crone who occupied\r\nthe chimney corner, and then glanced at the table, which displayed other\r\ncheer than he had been accustomed to see in his \xe2\x80\x9chonor\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwas a wooden dish of potatoes, which old Melmoth would have considered\r\nenough for a week\xe2\x80\x99s subsistence. There was the salted salmon, (a luxury\r\nunknown even in London. _Vide_ Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s Tales, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Absentee\xe2\x80\x9d).\r\n\r\nThere was the _slink-veal_, flanked with tripe; and, finally, there were\r\nlobsters and _fried_ turbot enough to justify what the author of the\r\ntale asserts, \xe2\x80\x9csuo periculo,\xe2\x80\x9d that when his great grandfather, the Dean\r\nof Killala, hired servants at the deanery, they stipulated that they\r\nshould not be required to eat turbot or lobster more than twice a-week.\r\nThere were also bottles of Wicklow ale, long and surreptitiously\r\nborrowed from his \xe2\x80\x9chonor\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d cellar, and which now made their first\r\nappearance on the kitchen hearth, and manifested their impatience of\r\nfurther constraint, by hissing, spitting, and bouncing in the face of\r\nthe fire that provoked its animosity. But the whiskey (genuine\r\nillegitimate potsheen, smelling strongly of weed and smoke, and\r\nbreathing defiance to excisemen) appeared, the \xe2\x80\x9cveritable Amphitryon\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nthe feast; every one praised, and drank as deeply as he praised.\r\n\r\nJohn, as he looked round the circle, and thought of his dying uncle, was\r\nforcibly reminded of the scene at Don Quixote\xe2\x80\x99s departure, where, in\r\nspite of the grief caused by the dissolution of the worthy knight, we\r\nare informed that \xe2\x80\x9cnevertheless the niece eat her victuals, the\r\nhousekeeper drank to the repose of his soul, and even Sancho cherished\r\nhis little carcase.\xe2\x80\x9d After returning, \xe2\x80\x9cas he might,\xe2\x80\x9d the courtesies of\r\nthe party, John asked how his uncle was. \xe2\x80\x9cAs bad as he can be;\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cMuch\r\nbetter, and many thanks to your honor,\xe2\x80\x9d was uttered in such rapid and\r\ndiscordant unison by the party, that John turned from one to the other,\r\nnot knowing which or what to believe. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say his honor has had a\r\nfright,\xe2\x80\x9d said a fellow, upwards of six feet high, approaching by way of\r\nwhispering, and then bellowing the sound six inches above John\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then his honor has had _a cool_ since,\xe2\x80\x9d said a man who was quietly\r\nswallowing the spirits that John had refused. At these words the Sybil\r\nwho sat in the chimney corner slowly drew her pipe from her mouth, and\r\nturned towards the party: The oracular movements of a Pythoness on her\r\ntripod never excited more awe, or impressed for the moment a deeper\r\nsilence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not _here_,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, pressing her withered finger on\r\nher wrinkled forehead, \xe2\x80\x9cnor _here_,--nor _here_;\xe2\x80\x9d and she extended her\r\nhand to the foreheads of those who were near her, who all bowed as if\r\nthey were receiving a benediction, but had immediate recourse to the\r\nspirits afterwards, as if to ensure its effects.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all _here_--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall _about the heart_;\xe2\x80\x9d and as she spoke she spread and pressed her\r\nfingers on her hollow bosom with a force of action that thrilled her\r\nhearers.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all _here_,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, repeating the action, (probably\r\nexcited by the effect she had produced), and then sunk on her seat,\r\nresumed her pipe, and spoke no more. At this moment of involuntary awe\r\non the part of John, and of terrified silence on that of the rest, an\r\nunusual sound was heard in the house, and the whole company started as\r\nif a musket had been discharged among them:--it was the unwonted sound\r\nof old Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s bell. His domestics were so few, and so constantly near\r\nhim, that the sound of his bell startled them as much as if he had been\r\nringing the knell for his own interment. \xe2\x80\x9cHe used always to _rap down_\r\nfor me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old housekeeper, hurrying out of the kitchen; \xe2\x80\x9che said\r\npulling the bells wore out the ropes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of the bell produced its full effect. The housekeeper rushed\r\ninto the room, followed by a number of women, (the Irish pr\xc3\xa6fic\xc3\xa6), all\r\nready to prescribe for the dying or weep for the dead,--all clapping\r\ntheir hard hands, or wiping their dry eyes. These hags all surrounded\r\nthe bed; and to witness their loud, wild, and desperate grief, their\r\ncries of \xe2\x80\x9cOh! he\xe2\x80\x99s going, his honor\xe2\x80\x99s going, his honor\xe2\x80\x99s going,\xe2\x80\x9d one\r\nwould have imagined their lives were bound up in his, like those of the\r\nwives in the story of Sinbad the Sailor, who were to be interred alive\r\nwith their deceased husbands.\r\n\r\nFour of them wrung their hands and howled round the bed, while one, with\r\nall the adroitness of a Mrs Quickly, felt his honor\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and \xe2\x80\x9cupward\r\nand upward,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9call was cold as any stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Melmoth withdrew his feet from the grasp of the hag,--counted with\r\nhis keen eye (keen amid the approaching dimness of death) the number\r\nassembled round his bed,--raised himself on his sharp elbow, and\r\npushing away the housekeeper, (who attempted to settle his nightcap,\r\nthat had been shoved on one side in the struggle, and gave his haggard,\r\ndying face, a kind of grotesque fierceness), bellowed out in tones\r\nthat made the company start,--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil brought ye all here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe question scattered the whole party for a moment; but rallying\r\ninstantly, they communed among themselves in whispers, and frequently\r\nusing the sign of the cross, muttered \xe2\x80\x9cThe devil,--Christ save us, the\r\ndevil in his mouth the first word he spoke.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d roared the invalid,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the devil in my eye the first sight I see.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere,--where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried the terrified housekeeper, clinging close to the invalid in her\r\nterror, and half-hiding herself in the blanket, which she snatched\r\nwithout mercy from his struggling and exposed limbs. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, there,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, (during the battle of the blanket), pointing to the huddled\r\nand terrified women, who stood aghast at hearing themselves arointed\r\nas the very demons they came to banish. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Lord keep your honor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper in a more soothing tone, when her fright\r\nwas over; \xe2\x80\x9cand sure your honor knows them all, is\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t _her_ name,--and\r\n_her_ name,--and _her_ name,\xe2\x80\x9d--and she pointed respectively to each\r\nof them, adding their names, which we shall spare the English reader\r\nthe torture of reciting, (as a proof of our lenity, adding the last\r\nonly, Cotchleen O\xe2\x80\x99Mulligan), \xe2\x80\x9cYe lie, ye b----h,\xe2\x80\x9d growled old Melmoth;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctheir name is Legion, for they are many,--turn them all out of the\r\nroom,--turn them all out of doors,--if they howl at my death, they\r\nshall howl in earnest,--not for my death, for they would see me dead\r\nand damned too with dry eyes, but for want of the whiskey that they\r\nwould have stolen if they could have got at it,\xe2\x80\x9d (and here old Melmoth\r\ngrasped a key which lay under his pillow, and shook it in vain triumph\r\nat the old housekeeper, who had long possessed the means of getting\r\nat the spirits unknown to his \xe2\x80\x9chonor\xe2\x80\x9d), \xe2\x80\x9cand for want of the victuals\r\nyou have pampered them with.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_Pampered_, oh Ch--st!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated the\r\nhousekeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cAye, and what are there so many candles for, all _fours_,\r\nand the same below I warrant. Ah! you--you--worthless, wasteful old\r\ndevil.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, your honor, they are all _sixes_.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSixes,--and\r\nwhat the devil are you burning sixes for, d\xe2\x80\x99ye think it\xe2\x80\x99s _the wake_\r\nalready? Ha?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! not yet, your honor, not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d chorussed the\r\nbeldams; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in God\xe2\x80\x99s good time, your honor knows,\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone that\r\nspoke ill suppressed impatience for the event. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! that your honor\r\nwould think of making your soul.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the first sensible word you\r\nhave said,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dying man, \xe2\x80\x9cfetch me the prayer-book,--you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind it there under that old boot-jack,--blow off the cobwebs;--it has\r\nnot been opened this many a year.\xe2\x80\x9d It was handed to him by the old\r\ngovernante, on whom he turned a reproaching eye. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you burn\r\nsixes in the kitchen, you extravagant jade? How many years have you\r\nlived in this house?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see\r\nany extravagance or waste in it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh never, never, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWas\r\nany thing but a farthing candle ever burned in the kitchen?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNever,\r\nnever, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWere not you kept as tight as hand and head and\r\nheart could keep you, were you not? answer me that.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, sure,\r\nyour honor; every _sowl_ about us knows that,--every one does your\r\nhonor justice, that you kept the closest house and closest hand in\r\nthe country,--your honor was always a good warrant for it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\r\ndare you unlock my hold before death has unlocked it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dying\r\nmiser, shaking his meagre hand at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI smelt meat in the house,--I\r\nheard voices in the house,--I heard the key turn in the door over and\r\nover. Oh that I was up,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, rolling in impatient agony in his\r\nbed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh that I was up, to see the waste and ruin that is going on. But\r\nit would kill me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, sinking back on the bolster, for he\r\nnever allowed himself a pillow; \xe2\x80\x9cit would kill me,--the very thought\r\nof it is killing me now.\xe2\x80\x9d The women, discomfited and defeated, after\r\nsundry winks and whispers, were huddling out of the room, till recalled\r\nby the sharp eager tones of old Melmoth.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are ye trooping to\r\nnow? back to the kitchen to gormandize and guzzle? Won\xe2\x80\x99t one of ye\r\nstay and listen while there\xe2\x80\x99s a prayer read for me? Ye may want it one\r\nday for yourselves, ye hags.\xe2\x80\x9d Awed by this expostulation and menace,\r\nthe train silently returned, and placed themselves round the bed,\r\nwhile the housekeeper, though a Catholic, asked if his honor would not\r\nhave a clergyman to give him _the rights_, (rites) of his church. The\r\neyes of the dying man sparkled with vexation at the proposal. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nfor,--just to have him expect a scarf and hat-band at the funeral.\r\nRead the prayers yourself, you old ------; that will save something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe housekeeper made the attempt, but soon declined it, alleging, as\r\nher reason, that her eyes had been watery ever since his honor took\r\nill. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because you had always a drop in them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid,\r\nwith a spiteful sneer, which the contraction of approaching death\r\nstiffened into a hideous grin.--\xe2\x80\x9cHere,--is not there one of you that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngnashing and howling there, that can get up a prayer to keep me from\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d So adjured, one of the women offered her services; and of her it\r\nmight truly be said, as of the \xe2\x80\x9cmost desartless man of the watch\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nDogberry\xe2\x80\x99s time, that \xe2\x80\x9cher reading and writing came by nature;\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nshe never had been at school, and had never before seen or opened a\r\nProtestant prayer book in her life; nevertheless, on she went, and with\r\nmore emphasis than good discretion, read nearly through the service for\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cchurching of women;\xe2\x80\x9d which in our prayer-books following that of\r\nthe burial of the dead, she perhaps imagined was someway connected with\r\nthe state of the invalid.\r\n\r\nShe read with great solemnity,--it was a pity that two interruptions\r\noccurred during the performance, one from old Melmoth, who, shortly\r\nafter the commencement of the prayers, turned towards the old\r\nhousekeeper, and said, in a tone scandalously audible, \xe2\x80\x9cGo down and draw\r\nthe niggers of the kitchen fire closer, and lock the door, and let me\r\n_hear it locked_. I can\xe2\x80\x99t mind any thing till that\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d The other\r\nwas from John Melmoth gliding into the room, hearing the inappropriate\r\nwords uttered by the ignorant woman, taking quietly as he knelt beside\r\nher the prayer-book from her hands, and reading in a suppressed voice\r\npart of that solemn service which, by the forms of the Church of\r\nEngland, is intended for the consolation of the departing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is John\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dying man; and the little kindness he\r\nhad ever shewed this unfortunate lad rushed on his hard heart at this\r\nmoment, and touched it. He saw himself, too, surrounded by heartless and\r\nrapacious menials; and slight as must have been his dependence on a\r\nrelative whom he had always treated as a stranger, he felt at this hour\r\nhe was no stranger, and grasped at his support like a straw amid his\r\nwreck. \xe2\x80\x9cJohn, my good boy, you are there.--I kept you far from me when\r\nliving, and now you are nearest me when dying.--John, _read on_.\xe2\x80\x9d John,\r\naffected deeply by the situation in which he beheld this _poor man_,\r\namid all his wealth, as well as by the solemn request to impart\r\nconsolation to his dying moments, read on;--but in a short time his\r\nvoice became indistinct, from the horror with which he listened to the\r\nincreasing hiccup of the patient, which, however, he struggled with from\r\ntime to time, to ask the housekeeper if _the niggers were closed_. John,\r\nwho was a lad of feeling, rose from his knees in some degree of\r\nagitation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, are you leaving me like the rest?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Melmoth,\r\ntrying to raise himself in the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said John; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserving the altered looks of the dying man, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you want some\r\nrefreshment, some support, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAye, I do, I do, but whom can I trust\r\nto get it for me. _They_, (and his haggard eye wandered round the\r\ngroupe), _they_ would poison me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTrust me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said John; \xe2\x80\x9cI will go\r\nto the apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s, or whoever you may employ.\xe2\x80\x9d The old man grasped his\r\nhand, drew him close to his bed, cast a threatening yet fearful eye\r\nround the party, and then whispered in a voice of agonized constraint,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a glass of wine, it would keep me alive for some hours, but\r\nthere is not one I can trust to get it for me,--_they\xe2\x80\x99d steal a bottle,\r\nand ruin me_.\xe2\x80\x9d John was greatly shocked. \xe2\x80\x9cSir, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let _me_\r\nget a glass of wine for you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man,\r\nwith an expression in his face John could not understand. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir; you\r\nknow I have been rather a stranger here, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTake this key,\xe2\x80\x9d said old\r\nMelmoth, after a violent spasm; \xe2\x80\x9ctake this key, there is wine in that\r\ncloset,--_Madeira_. I always told them there was nothing there, but they\r\ndid not believe me, or I should not have been robbed as I have been. At\r\none time I said it was whiskey, and then I fared worse than ever, for\r\nthey drank twice as much of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn took the key from his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s hand; the dying man pressed it as he\r\ndid so, and John, interpreting this as a mark of kindness, returned the\r\npressure. He was undeceived by the whisper that followed,--\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, my\r\nlad, don\xe2\x80\x99t drink any of that wine while you are there.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJohn, indignantly throwing the key on the bed; then, recollecting that\r\nthe miserable being before him was no object of resentment, he gave the\r\npromise required, and entered the closet, which no foot but that of old\r\nMelmoth had entered for nearly sixty years. He had some difficulty in\r\nfinding out the wine, and indeed staid long enough to justify his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions,--but his mind was agitated, and his hand unsteady.\r\nHe could not but remark his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary look, that had the\r\nghastliness of fear superadded to that of death, as he gave him\r\npermission to enter his closet. He could not but see the looks of horror\r\nwhich the women exchanged as he approached it. And, finally, when he was\r\nin it, his memory was malicious enough to suggest some faint traces of a\r\nstory, too horrible for imagination, connected with it. He remembered in\r\none moment most distinctly, that no one but his uncle had ever been\r\nknown to enter it for many years.\r\n\r\nBefore he quitted it, he held up the dim light, and looked around him\r\nwith a mixture of terror and curiosity. There was a great deal of\r\ndecayed and useless lumber, such as might be supposed to be heaped up to\r\nrot in a miser\xe2\x80\x99s closet; but John\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were in a moment, and as if by\r\nmagic, rivetted on a portrait that hung on the wall, and appeared, even\r\nto his untaught eye, far superior to the tribe of family pictures that\r\nare left to moulder on the walls of a family mansion. It represented a\r\nman of middle age. There was nothing remarkable in the costume, or in\r\nthe countenance, but _the eyes_, John felt, were such as one feels they\r\nwish they had never seen, and feels they can never forget. Had he been\r\nacquainted with the poetry of Southey, he might have often exclaimed in\r\nhis after-life,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the eyes had life,\r\n     They gleamed with demon light.\xe2\x80\x9d--THALABA.\r\n\r\nFrom an impulse equally resistless and painful, he approached the\r\nportrait, held the candle towards it, and could distinguish the words on\r\nthe border of the painting,--Jno. Melmoth, anno 1646. John was neither\r\ntimid by nature, or nervous by constitution, or superstitious from\r\nhabit, yet he continued to gaze in stupid horror on this singular\r\npicture, till, aroused by his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s cough, he hurried into his room.\r\nThe old man swallowed the wine. He appeared a little revived; it was\r\nlong since he had tasted such a cordial,--his heart appeared to expand\r\nto a momentary confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cJohn, what did you see in that room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a lie; every one wants to cheat or to rob me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do either.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did you see that you--you\r\ntook notice of?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a picture, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA picture, Sir!--the original\r\nis still alive.\xe2\x80\x9d John, though under the impression of his recent\r\nfeelings, could not but look incredulous. \xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered his\r\nuncle;--\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, they say I am dying of this and that; and one says it is\r\nfor want of nourishment, and one says it is for want of medicine,--but,\r\nJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d and his face looked hideously ghastly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am dying of a fright.\r\nThat man,\xe2\x80\x9d and he extended his meagre arm toward the closet, as if he\r\nwas pointing to a living being; \xe2\x80\x9cthat man, I have good reason to know,\r\nis alive still.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow is that possible, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said John involuntarily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe date on the picture is 1646.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen it,--you have noticed\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said his uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d--he rocked and nodded on his bolster for a\r\nmoment, then, grasping John\xe2\x80\x99s hand with an unutterable look, he\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will see him again, he is alive.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, sinking back on\r\nhis bolster, he fell into a kind of sleep or stupor, his eyes still\r\nopen, and fixed on John.\r\n\r\nThe house was now perfectly silent, and John had time and space for\r\nreflection. More thoughts came crowding on him than he wished to\r\nwelcome, but they would not be repulsed. He thought of his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhabits and character, turned the matter over and over again in his mind,\r\nand he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThe last man on earth to be superstitious. He\r\nnever thought of any thing but the price of stocks, and the rate of\r\nexchange, and my college expences, that hung heavier at his heart than\r\nall; and such a man to die of a fright,--a ridiculous fright, that a man\r\nliving 150 years ago is alive still, and yet--he is dying.\xe2\x80\x9d John paused,\r\nfor facts will confute the most stubborn logician. \xe2\x80\x9cWith all his\r\nhardness of mind, and of heart, he is dying of a fright. I heard it in\r\nthe kitchen, I have heard it from himself,--he could not be deceived. If\r\nI had ever heard he was nervous, or fanciful, or superstitious, but a\r\ncharacter so contrary to all these impressions;--a man that, as poor\r\nButler says, in his Remains of the Antiquarian, would have \xe2\x80\x9dsold Christ\r\nover again for the numerical piece of silver which Judas got for\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9c--such a man to die of fear! Yet he _is_ dying,\xe2\x80\x9d said John,\r\nglancing his fearful eye on the contracted nostril, the glazed eye, the\r\ndropping jaw, the whole horrible apparatus of the _facies Hippocratica_\r\ndisplayed, and soon to cease its display.\r\n\r\nOld Melmoth at this moment seemed to be in a deep stupor; his eyes lost\r\nthat little expression they had before, and his hands, that had\r\nconvulsively been catching at the blankets, let go their short and\r\nquivering grasp, and lay extended on the bed like the claws of some bird\r\nthat had died of hunger,--so meagre, so yellow, so spread. John,\r\nunaccustomed to the sight of death, believed this to be only a sign that\r\nhe was going to sleep; and, urged by an impulse for which he did not\r\nattempt to account to himself, caught up the miserable light, and once\r\nmore ventured into the forbidden room,--the _blue chamber_ of the\r\ndwelling. The motion roused the dying man;--he sat bolt upright in his\r\nbed. This John could not see, for he was now in the closet; but he heard\r\nthe groan, or rather the choaked and guggling rattle of the throat, that\r\nannounces the horrible conflict between muscular and mental convulsion.\r\nHe started, turned away; but, as he turned away, he thought he saw the\r\neyes of the portrait, on which his own was fixed, _move_, and hurried\r\nback to his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s bedside.\r\n\r\nOld Melmoth died in the course of that night, and died as he had lived,\r\nin a kind of avaricious delirium. John could not have imagined a scene\r\nso horrible as his last hours presented. He cursed and blasphemed about\r\nthree half-pence, missing, as he said, some weeks before, in an account\r\nof change with his groom, about hay to a starved horse that he kept.\r\nThen he grasped John\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and asked him to give him the sacrament.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I send to the clergyman, he will charge me something for it, which I\r\ncannot pay,--I cannot. They say I am rich,--look at this blanket;--but I\r\nwould not mind that, if I could save my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d And, raving, he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Doctor, I am a very poor man. I never troubled a clergyman\r\nbefore, and all I want is, that you will grant me two trifling requests,\r\nvery little matters in your way,--save my soul, and (whispering) make\r\ninterest to get me a parish coffin,--I have not enough left to bury me.\r\nI always told every one I was poor, but the more I told them so, the\r\nless they believed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn, greatly shocked, retired from the bed-side, and sat down in a\r\ndistant corner of the room. The women were again in the room, which was\r\nvery dark. Melmoth was silent from exhaustion, and there was a\r\ndeath-like pause for some time. At this moment John saw the door open,\r\nand a figure appear at it, who looked round the room, and then quietly\r\nand deliberately retired, but not before John had discovered in his face\r\nthe living original of the portrait. His first impulse was to utter an\r\nexclamation of terror, but his breath felt stopped. He was then rising\r\nto pursue the figure, but a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection checked him. What could\r\nbe more absurd, than to be alarmed or amazed at a resemblance between a\r\nliving man and the portrait of a dead one! The likeness was doubtless\r\nstrong enough to strike him even in that darkened room, but it was\r\ndoubtless only a likeness; and though it might be imposing enough to\r\nterrify an old man of gloomy and retired habits, and with a broken\r\nconstitution, John resolved it should not produce the same effect on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut while he was applauding himself for this resolution, the door\r\nopened, and the figure appeared at it, beckoning and nodding to him,\r\nwith a familiarity somewhat terrifying. John now started up, determined\r\nto pursue it; but the pursuit was stopped by the weak but shrill cries\r\nof his uncle, who was struggling at once with the agonies of death and\r\nhis housekeeper. The poor woman, anxious for her master\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and\r\nher own, was trying to put on him a clean shirt and nightcap, and\r\nMelmoth, who had just sensation enough to perceive they were taking\r\nsomething from him, continued exclaiming feebly, \xe2\x80\x9cThey are robbing\r\nme,--robbing me in my last moments,--robbing a dying man. John, won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou assist me,--I shall die a beggar; they are taking my last shirt,--I\r\nshall die a beggar.\xe2\x80\x9d--And the miser died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    You that wander, scream, and groan,\r\n    Round the mansions once your own.\r\n\r\n    ROWE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after the funeral, the will was opened before proper\r\nwitnesses, and John was found to be left sole heir to his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproperty, which, though originally moderate, had, by his grasping\r\nhabits, and parsimonious life, become very considerable.\r\n\r\nAs the attorney who read the will concluded, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some\r\nwords here, at the corner of the parchment, which do not appear to be\r\npart of the will, as they are neither in the form of a codicil, nor is\r\nthe signature of the testator affixed to them; but, to the best of my\r\nbelief, they are in the hand-writing of the deceased.\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke he\r\nshewed the lines to Melmoth, who immediately recognized his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, (that perpendicular and penurious hand, that seems determined to\r\nmake the most of the very paper, thriftily abridging every word, and\r\nleaving scarce an atom of margin), and read, not without some emotion,\r\nthe following words: \xe2\x80\x9cI enjoin my nephew and heir, John Melmoth, to\r\nremove, destroy, or cause to be destroyed, the portrait inscribed J.\r\nMelmoth, 1646, hanging in my closet. I also enjoin him to search for a\r\nmanuscript, which I think he will find in the third and lowest left-hand\r\ndrawer of the mahogany chest standing under that portrait,--it is among\r\nsome papers of no value, such as manuscript sermons, and pamphlets on\r\nthe improvement of Ireland, and such stuff; he will distinguish it by\r\nits being tied round with a black tape, and the paper being very mouldy\r\nand discoloured. He may read it if he will;--I think he had better not.\r\nAt all events, I adjure him, if there be any power in the adjuration of\r\na dying man, to burn it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter reading this singular memorandum, the business of the meeting was\r\nagain resumed; and as old Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s will was very clear and legally\r\nworded, all was soon settled, the party dispersed, and John Melmoth was\r\nleft alone.\r\n\r\nWe should have mentioned, that his guardians appointed by the will (for\r\nhe was not yet of age) advised him to return to College, and complete\r\nhis education as soon as proper; but John urged the expediency of paying\r\nthe respect due to his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s memory, by remaining a decent time in the\r\nhouse after his decease. This was not his real motive. Curiosity, or\r\nsomething that perhaps deserves a better name, the wild and awful\r\npursuit of an indefinite object, had taken strong hold of his mind. His\r\nguardians (who were men of respectability and property in the\r\nneighbourhood, and in whose eyes John\xe2\x80\x99s consequence had risen rapidly\r\nsince the reading of the will), pressed him to accept of a temporary\r\nresidence in their respective houses, till his return to Dublin. This\r\nwas declined gratefully, but steadily. They called for their horses,\r\nshook hands with the heir, and rode off--Melmoth was left alone.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day was passed in gloomy and anxious\r\ndeliberation,--in traversing his late uncle\xe2\x80\x99s room,--approaching the\r\ndoor of the closet, and then retreating from it,--in watching the\r\nclouds, and listening to the wind, as if the gloom of the one, or the\r\nmurmurs of the other, relieved instead of increasing the weight that\r\npressed on his mind. Finally, towards evening, he summoned the old\r\nwoman, from whom he expected something like an explanation of the\r\nextraordinary circumstances he had witnessed since his arrival at his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s. The old woman, proud of the summons, readily attended, but she\r\nhad very little to tell,--her communication was nearly in the following\r\nwords: (We spare the reader her endless circumlocutions, her Irishcisms,\r\nand the frequent interruptions arising from her applications to her\r\nsnuff-box, and to the glass of whiskey punch with which Melmoth took\r\ncare to have her supplied). The old woman deposed, \xe2\x80\x9cThat his honor (as\r\nshe always called the deceased) was always intent upon the little room\r\ninside his bed-chamber, and reading there, within the last two\r\nyears;--that people, knowing his honor had money, and thinking it must\r\nbe there, had broke into that room, (in other words, there was a robbery\r\nattempted there), but finding nothing but some papers, they had\r\nretired;--that he was so frightened, he had bricked up the window; but\r\n_she thought there was more in it than that_, for when his honor missed\r\nbut a half-penny, he would make the house ring about it, but that, when\r\nthe closet was bricked up, he never said a word;--that afterwards his\r\nhonor used to lock himself up in his own room, and though he was never\r\nfond of reading, was always found, when his dinner was brought him,\r\nhanging over a paper, which he hid the moment any one came into the\r\nroom, and once there was a great bustle about a picture that he tried to\r\nconceal;--that knowing there was an _odd story in the family_, she did\r\nher best to come at it, and even went to Biddy Brannigan\xe2\x80\x99s, (the medical\r\nSybil before mentioned), to find out the rights of it; but Biddy only\r\nshook her head, filled her pipe, uttered some words she did not\r\nunderstand, and smoked on;--that it was but two evenings before his\r\nhonor _was struck_, (_i.\xc2\xa0e._ took ill), she was standing at the door of\r\nthe court, (which had once been surrounded by stables, pigeon-house, and\r\nall the usual etceteras of a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s residence, but now presented\r\nonly a ruinous range of dismantled out-offices, thatched with thistles,\r\nand tenanted by pigs), when his honor called to her to lock the door,\r\n(his honor was always _keen_ about locking the doors early); she was\r\nhastening to do so, when he snatched the key from her, swearing at her,\r\n(for he was always very keen about locking the doors, though the locks\r\nwere so bad, and the keys so rusty, that it was always like _the cry of\r\nthe dead_ in the house when the keys were turned);--that she stood aside\r\nfor a minute, seeing he was angry, and gave him the key, when she heard\r\nhim utter a scream, and saw him fall across the door-way;--that she\r\nhurried to raise him, _hoping_ it was a fit;--that she found him stiff\r\nand stretched out, and called for help to lift him up;--that then people\r\ncame from the kitchen to assist;--that she was so bewildered and\r\nterrified, she hardly knew what was done or said; but with all her\r\nterror remembered, that as they raised him up, the first sign of life he\r\ngave was lifting up his arm, and pointing it towards the court, and at\r\nthat moment she saw the figure of a tall man cross the court, and go out\r\nof the court, she knew not where or how, for the outer gate was locked,\r\nand had not been opened for years, and they were all gathered round his\r\nhonor at the other door;--she saw the figure,--she saw the shadow on the\r\nwall,--she saw him walk slowly through the court, and in her terror\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cStop him,\xe2\x80\x9d but nobody minded her, all being busy about her\r\nmaster; and when he was brought to his room, nobody thought but of\r\ngetting him to himself again. And further she could not tell. His honor\r\n(young Melmoth) knew as much as she,--he had witnessed his last illness,\r\nhad heard his last words, he saw him die,--how could she know more than\r\nhis honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melmoth, \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly saw him die; but--you say _there was\r\nan odd story in the family_, do you know any thing about it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot a\r\nword, it was long before my time, as old as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it must\r\nhave been so; but, was my uncle ever superstitious, fanciful?\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nMelmoth was compelled to use many synonymous expressions, before he\r\ncould make himself understood. When he did, the answer was plain and\r\ndecisive, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, never, never. When his honor sat in the kitchen in\r\nwinter, to save a fire in his own room, he could never bear the talk of\r\nthe old women that came in to light their pipes _betimes_, (from time to\r\ntime). He used to shew such impatience of their superstitious nonsense,\r\nthat they were fain to smoke them in silence, without the consolatory\r\naccompaniment of one whisper about a child that the evil eye had looked\r\non, or another, that though apparently a mewling, peevish, crippled brat\r\nall day, went regularly out at night to dance with the _good people_ on\r\nthe top of a neighbouring mountain, summoned thereto by the sound of a\r\nbag-pipe, which was unfailingly heard at the cabin door every night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMelmoth\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts began to take somewhat of a darker hue at this\r\naccount. If his uncle was not superstitious, might he not have been\r\nguilty, and might not his strange and sudden death, and even the\r\nterrible visitation that preceded it, have been owing to some wrong that\r\nhis rapacity had done the widow and the fatherless. He questioned the\r\nold woman indirectly and cautiously on the subject,--her answer\r\ncompletely justified the deceased. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cof a hard\r\nhand, and a hard heart, but he was as jealous of another\xe2\x80\x99s right as of\r\nhis own. He would have starved all the world, but he would not have\r\nwronged it of a farthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelmoth\xe2\x80\x99s last resource was to send for Biddy Brannigan, who was still\r\nin the house, and from whom he at least hoped to hear the odd story that\r\nthe old woman confessed was in the family. She came, and, on her\r\nintroduction to Melmoth, it was curious to observe the mingled look of\r\nservility and command, the result of the habits of her life, which was\r\nalternately one of abject mendicity, and of arrogant but clever\r\nimposture. When she first appeared, she stood at the door, awed and\r\ncurtseying in the presence, and muttering sounds which, possibly\r\nintended for blessings, had, from the harsh tone and witch-like look of\r\nthe speaker, every appearance of malediction; but when interrogated on\r\nthe subject of the story, she rose at once into consequence,--her figure\r\nseemed frightfully dilated, like that of Virgil\xe2\x80\x99s Alecto, who exchanges\r\nin a moment the appearance of a feeble old woman for that of a menacing\r\nfury. She walked deliberately across the room, seated, or rather\r\nsquatted herself on the hearth-stone like a hare in her form, spread her\r\nbony and withered hands towards the blaze, and rocked for a considerable\r\ntime in silence before she commenced her tale. When she had finished it,\r\nMelmoth remained in astonishment at the state of mind to which the late\r\nsingular circumstances had reduced him,--at finding himself listening\r\nwith varying and increasing emotions of interest, curiosity, and terror,\r\nto a tale so wild, so improbable, nay, so actually incredible, that he\r\nat least blushed for the folly he could not conquer. The result of these\r\nimpressions was, a resolution to visit the closet, and examine the\r\nmanuscript that very night.\r\n\r\nThis resolution he found it impossible to execute immediately, for, on\r\ninquiring for lights, the gouvernante confessed the very last had been\r\nburnt at _his honor\xe2\x80\x99s_ wake; and a bare-footed boy was charged to run\r\nfor life and death to the neighbouring village for candles; and if you\r\ncould _borry_ a couple of candlesticks, added the housekeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nthere no candlesticks in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melmoth. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are, honey,\r\nplinty, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no time to be opening the old chest, for the plated\r\nones, in regard of their being at the bottom of it, and the brass ones\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s _in it_ (in the house), one of them has no socket, and the other\r\nhas no bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did you make shift yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melmoth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nstuck it in a potatoe,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the housekeeper. So the _gossoon_ ran for\r\nlife and death, and Melmoth, towards the close of the evening, was left\r\nalone to meditate.\r\n\r\nIt was an evening apt for meditation, and Melmoth had his fill of it\r\nbefore the messenger returned. The weather was cold and gloomy; heavy\r\nclouds betokened a long and dreary continuance of autumnal rains; cloud\r\nafter cloud came sweeping on like the dark banners of an approaching\r\nhost, whose march is for desolation. As Melmoth leaned against the\r\nwindow, whose dismantled frame, and pieced and shattered panes, shook\r\nwith every gust of wind, his eye encountered nothing but that most\r\ncheerless of all prospects, a miser\xe2\x80\x99s garden,--walls broken down,\r\ngrass-grown walks whose grass was not even green, dwarfish, doddered,\r\nleafless trees, and a luxuriant crop of nettles and weeds rearing their\r\nunlovely heads where there had once been flowers, all waving and bending\r\nin capricious and unsightly forms, as the wind sighed over them. It was\r\nthe verdure of the church yard, the garden of death. He turned for\r\nrelief to the room, but no relief was there,--the wainscotting dark with\r\ndirt, and in many places cracked and starting from the walls,--the rusty\r\ngrate, so long unconscious of a fire, that nothing but a sullen smoke\r\ncould be coaxed to issue from between its dingy bars,--the crazy chairs,\r\ntheir torn bottoms of rush drooping inwards, and the great leathern seat\r\ndisplaying the stuffing round the worn edges, while the nails, though\r\nthey kept their places, had failed to keep the covering they once\r\nfastened,--the chimney-piece, which, tarnished more by time than by\r\nsmoke, displayed for its garniture half a pair of snuffers, a tattered\r\nalmanack of 1750, a time-keeper dumb for want of repair, and a rusty\r\nfowling-piece without a lock.--No wonder the spectacle of desolation\r\ndrove Melmoth back to his own thoughts, restless and uncomfortable as\r\nthey were. He recapitulated the Sybil\xe2\x80\x99s story word by word, with the air\r\nof a man who is cross-examining an evidence, and trying to make him\r\ncontradict himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first of the Melmoths, she says, who settled in Ireland, was an\r\nofficer in Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s army, who obtained a grant of lands, the\r\nconfiscated property of an Irish family attached to the royal cause. The\r\nelder brother of this man was one who had travelled abroad, and resided\r\nso long on the Continent, that his family had lost all recollection of\r\nhim. Their memory was not stimulated by their affection, for there were\r\nstrange reports concerning the traveller. He was said to be (like the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdamned magician, great Glendower,\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9ca gentleman profited in strange\r\nconcealments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, that at this period, and even to a later, the\r\nbelief in astrology and witchcraft was very general. Even so late as the\r\nreign of Charles\xc2\xa0II. Dryden calculated the nativity of his son Charles,\r\nthe ridiculous books of Glanville were in general circulation, and\r\nDelrio and Wierus were so popular, that even a dramatic writer\r\n(Shadwell) quoted copiously from them, in the notes subjoined to his\r\ncurious comedy of the Lancashire witches. It was said, that during the\r\nlife-time of Melmoth, the traveller paid him a visit; and though he must\r\nhave then been considerably advanced in life, to the astonishment of his\r\nfamily, he did not betray the slightest trace of being a year older than\r\nwhen they last beheld him. His visit was short, he said nothing of the\r\npast or the future, nor did his family question him. It was said that\r\nthey did not feel themselves perfectly at ease in his presence. On his\r\ndeparture he left them his picture, (the same which Melmoth saw in the\r\ncloset, bearing date 1646), and they saw him no more. Some years after,\r\na person arrived from England, directed to Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s house, in pursuit\r\nof the traveller, and exhibiting the most marvellous and unappeasable\r\nsolicitude to obtain some intelligence of him. The family could give him\r\nnone, and after some days of restless inquiry and agitation, he\r\ndeparted, leaving behind him, either through negligence or intention, a\r\nmanuscript, containing an extraordinary account of the circumstances\r\nunder which he had met John Melmoth the Traveller (as he was called).\r\n\r\nThe manuscript and portrait were both preserved, and of the original a\r\nreport spread that he was still alive, and had been frequently seen in\r\nIreland even to the present century,--but that he was never known to\r\nappear but on the approaching death of one of the family, nor even then,\r\nunless when the evil passions or habits of the individual had cast a\r\nshade of gloomy and fearful interest over their dying hour.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore judged no favourable augury for the spiritual\r\ndestination of the last Melmoth, that this extraordinary person had\r\nvisited, or been imagined to visit, the house previous to his decease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the account given by Biddy Brannigan, to which she added her\r\nown solemnly-attested belief, that John Melmoth the Traveller was still\r\nwithout a hair on his head changed, or a muscle in his frame\r\ncontracted;--that she had seen those that had seen him, and would\r\nconfirm their evidence by oath if necessary;--that he was never heard to\r\nspeak, seen to partake of food, or known to enter any dwelling but that\r\nof his family;--and, finally, that she herself believed that his late\r\nappearance boded no good either to the living or the dead.\r\n\r\nJohn was still musing on these things when the lights were procured,\r\nand, disregarding the pallid countenances and monitory whispers of the\r\nattendants, he resolutely entered the closet, shut the door, and\r\nproceeded to search for the manuscript. It was soon found, for the\r\ndirections of old Melmoth were forcibly written, and strongly\r\nremembered. The manuscript, old, tattered, and discoloured, was taken\r\nfrom the very drawer in which it was mentioned to be laid. Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands felt as cold as those of his dead uncle, when he drew the blotted\r\npages from their nook. He sat down to read,--there was a dead silence\r\nthrough the house. Melmoth looked wistfully at the candles, snuffed\r\nthem, and still thought they looked dim, (perchance he thought they\r\nburned blue, but such thought he kept to himself.) Certain it is, he\r\noften changed his posture, and would have changed his chair, had there\r\nbeen more than one in the apartment.\r\n\r\nHe sunk for a few moments into a fit of gloomy abstraction, till the\r\nsound of the clock striking twelve made him start,--it was the only\r\nsound he had heard for some hours, and the sounds produced by inanimate\r\nthings, while all living beings around are as dead, have at such an hour\r\nan effect indescribably awful. John looked at his manuscript with some\r\nreluctance, opened it, paused over the first lines, and as the wind\r\nsighed round the desolate apartment, and the rain pattered with a\r\nmournful sound against the dismantled window, wished----what did he wish\r\nfor?--he wished the sound of the wind less dismal, and the dash of the\r\nrain less monotonous.----He may be forgiven, it was past midnight, and\r\nthere was not a human being awake but himself within ten miles when he\r\nbegan to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    Apparebat eidolon _senex_.\r\n\r\n    PLINY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manuscript was discoloured, obliterated, and mutilated beyond any\r\nthat had ever before exercised the patience of a reader. Michaelis\r\nhimself, scrutinizing into the pretended autograph of St Mark at Venice,\r\nnever had a harder time of it.--Melmoth could make out only a sentence\r\nhere and there. The writer, it appeared, was an Englishman of the name\r\nof Stanton, who had travelled abroad shortly after the Restoration.\r\nTravelling was not then attended with the facilities which modern\r\nimprovement has introduced, and scholars and literati, the intelligent,\r\nthe idle, and the curious, wandered over the Continent for years, like\r\n_Tom Coryat_, though they had the modesty, on their return, to entitle\r\nthe result of their multiplied observations and labours only\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccrudities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStanton, about the year 1676, was in Spain; he was, like most of the\r\ntravellers of that age, a man of literature, intelligence, and\r\ncuriosity, but ignorant of the language of the country, and fighting his\r\nway at times from convent to convent, in quest of what was called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHospitality,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, obtaining board and lodging on the condition of\r\nholding a debate in Latin, on some point theological or metaphysical,\r\nwith any monk who would become the champion of the strife. Now, as the\r\ntheology was Catholic, and the metaphysics Aristotelian, Stanton\r\nsometimes wished himself at the miserable Posada from whose filth and\r\nfamine he had been fighting his escape; but though his reverend\r\nantagonists always denounced his creed, and comforted themselves, even\r\nin defeat, with the assurance that he must be damned, on the double\r\nscore of his being a heretic and an Englishman, they were obliged to\r\nconfess that his Latin was good, and his logic unanswerable; and he was\r\nallowed, in most cases, to sup and sleep in peace. This was not doomed\r\nto be his fate on the night of the 17th August 1677, when he found\r\nhimself in the plains of Valencia, deserted by a cowardly guide, who had\r\nbeen terrified by the sight of a cross erected as a memorial of a\r\nmurder, had slipped off his mule unperceived, crossing himself every\r\nstep he took on his retreat from the heretic, and left Stanton amid the\r\nterrors of an approaching storm, and the dangers of an unknown country.\r\nThe sublime and yet softened beauty of the scenery around, had filled\r\nthe soul of Stanton with delight, and he enjoyed that delight as\r\nEnglishmen generally do, silently.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent remains of two dynasties that had passed away, the ruins\r\nof Roman palaces, and of Moorish fortresses, were around and above\r\nhim;--the dark and heavy thunder-clouds that advanced slowly, seemed\r\nlike the shrouds of these spectres of departed greatness; they\r\napproached, but did not yet overwhelm or conceal them, as if nature\r\nherself was for once awed by the power of man; and far below, the lovely\r\nvalley of Valencia blushed and burned in all the glory of sunset, like a\r\nbride receiving the last glowing kiss of the bridegroom before the\r\napproach of night. Stanton gazed around. The difference between the\r\narchitecture of the Roman and Moorish ruins struck him. Among the former\r\nare the remains of a theatre, and something like a public place; the\r\nlatter present only the remains of fortresses, embattled, castellated,\r\nand fortified from top to bottom,--not a loop-hole for pleasure to get\r\nin by,--the loop-holes were only for arrows; all denoted military power\r\nand despotic subjugation _a l\xe2\x80\x99outrance_. The contrast might have pleased\r\na philosopher, and he might have indulged in the reflection, that though\r\nthe ancient Greeks and Romans were savages, (as Dr Johnson says all\r\npeople who want a press must be, and he says truly), yet they were\r\nwonderful savages for their time, for they alone have left _traces of\r\ntheir taste for pleasure_ in the countries they conquered, in their\r\nsuperb theatres, temples, (which were also dedicated to pleasure one way\r\nor another), and baths, while other conquering bands of savages never\r\nleft any thing behind them but traces of their rage for power. So\r\nthought Stanton, as he still saw strongly defined, though darkened by\r\nthe darkening clouds, the huge skeleton of a Roman amphitheatre, its\r\narched and gigantic colonnades now admitting a gleam of light, and now\r\ncommingling with the purple thunder-cloud; and now the solid and heavy\r\nmass of a Moorish fortress, no light playing between its impermeable\r\nwalls,--the image of power, dark, isolated, impenetrable. Stanton forgot\r\nhis cowardly guide, his loneliness, his danger amid an approaching storm\r\nand an inhospitable country, where his name and country would shut every\r\ndoor against him, and every peal of thunder would be supposed justified\r\nby the daring intrusion of a heretic in the dwelling of an _old\r\nChristian_, as the Spanish Catholics absurdly term themselves, to mark\r\nthe distinction between them and the baptised Moors.--All this was\r\nforgot in contemplating the glorious and awful scenery before\r\nhim,--light struggling with darkness,--and darkness menacing a light\r\nstill more terrible, and announcing its menace in the blue and livid\r\nmass of cloud that hovered like a destroying angel in the air, its\r\narrows aimed, but their direction awfully indefinite. But he ceased to\r\nforget these local and petty dangers, as the sublimity of romance would\r\nterm them, when he saw the first flash of the lightning, broad and red\r\nas the banners of an insulting army whose motto is _V\xc3\xa6 victis_, shatter\r\nto atoms the remains of a Roman tower;--the rifted stones rolled down\r\nthe hill, and fell at the feet of Stanton. He stood appalled, and,\r\nawaiting his summons from the Power in whose eye pyramids, palaces, and\r\nthe worms whose toil has formed them, and the worms who toil out their\r\nexistence under their shadow or their pressure, are perhaps all alike\r\ncontemptible, he stood collected, and for a moment felt that defiance of\r\ndanger which danger itself excites, and we love to encounter it as a\r\nphysical enemy, to bid it \xe2\x80\x9cdo its worst,\xe2\x80\x9d and feel that its worst will\r\nperhaps be ultimately its best for us. He stood and saw another flash\r\ndart its bright, brief, and malignant glance over the ruins of ancient\r\npower, and the luxuriance of recent fertility. Singular contrast! The\r\nrelics of art for ever decaying,--the productions of nature for ever\r\nrenewed.--(Alas! for what purpose are they renewed, better than to mock\r\nat the perishable monuments which men try in vain to rival them by). The\r\npyramids themselves must perish, but the grass that grows between their\r\ndisjointed stones will be renewed from year to year. Stanton was\r\nthinking thus, when all power of thought was suspended, by seeing two\r\npersons bearing between them the body of a young, and apparently very\r\nlovely girl, who had been struck dead by the lightning. Stanton\r\napproached, and heard the voices of the bearers repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nnone who will mourn for her!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere is none who will mourn for her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid other voices, as two more bore in their arms the blasted and\r\nblackened figure of what had once been a man, comely and\r\ngraceful;--\xe2\x80\x9cthere is not _one_ to mourn for her now!\xe2\x80\x9d They were lovers,\r\nand he had been consumed by the flash that had destroyed her, while in\r\nthe act of endeavouring to defend her. As they were about to remove the\r\nbodies, a person approached with a calmness of step and demeanour, as if\r\nhe were alone unconscious of danger, and incapable of fear; and after\r\nlooking on them for some time, burst into a laugh so loud, wild, and\r\nprotracted, that the peasants, starting with as much horror at the sound\r\nas at that of the storm, hurried away, bearing the corse with them. Even\r\nStanton\xe2\x80\x99s fears were subdued by his astonishment, and, turning to the\r\nstranger, who remained standing on the same spot, he asked the reason of\r\nsuch an outrage on humanity. The stranger, slowly turning round, and\r\ndisclosing a countenance which---- (Here the manuscript was illegible\r\nfor a few lines), said in English---- (A long hiatus followed here, and\r\nthe next passage that was legible, though it proved to be a continuation\r\nof the narrative, was but a fragment). * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe terrors of the night rendered Stanton a sturdy and unappeasable\r\napplicant; and the shrill voice of the old woman, repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\nheretic--no English--Mother of God protect us--avaunt Satan!\xe2\x80\x9d--combined\r\nwith the clatter of the wooden casement (peculiar to the houses in\r\nValentia) which she opened to discharge her volley of anathematization,\r\nand shut again as the lightning glanced through the aperture, were\r\nunable to repel his importunate request for admittance, in a night whose\r\nterrors ought to soften all the miserable petty local passions into one\r\nawful feeling of fear for the Power who caused it, and compassion for\r\nthose who were exposed to it.--But Stanton felt there was something more\r\nthan national bigotry in the exclamations of the old woman; there was a\r\npeculiar and personal horror of the English.--And he was right; but this\r\ndid not diminish the eagerness of his * * * * * The house was handsome\r\nand spacious, but the melancholy appearance of desertion * * * * * * * *\r\n* * * --The benches were by the wall, but there were none to sit there;\r\nthe tables were spread in what had been the hall, but it seemed as if\r\nnone had gathered round them for many years;--the clock struck audibly,\r\nthere was no voice of mirth or of occupation to drown its sound; time\r\ntold his awful lesson to silence alone;--the hearths were black with\r\nfuel long since consumed;--the family portraits looked as if they were\r\nthe only tenants of the mansion; they seemed to say, from their\r\nmouldering frames, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are none to gaze on us;\xe2\x80\x9d and the echo of the\r\nsteps of Stanton and his feeble guide, was the only sound audible\r\nbetween the peals of thunder that rolled still awfully, but more\r\ndistantly,--every peal like the exhausted murmurs of a spent heart. As\r\nthey passed on, a shriek was heard. Stanton paused, and fearful images\r\nof the dangers to which travellers on the Continent are exposed in\r\ndeserted and remote habitations, came into his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t heed it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the old woman, lighting him on with a miserable lamp;--\xe2\x80\x9cit is only\r\nhe * * * * * * * * * * * The old woman having now satisfied herself, by\r\nocular demonstration, that her English guest, even if he was the devil,\r\nhad neither horn, hoof, or tail, that he could bear the sign of the\r\ncross without changing his form, and that, when he spoke, not a puff of\r\nsulphur came out of his mouth, began to take courage, and at length\r\ncommenced her story, which, weary and comfortless as Stanton was, * * *\r\n* *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery obstacle was now removed; parents and relations at last gave up\r\nall opposition, and the young pair were united. Never was there a\r\nlovelier,--they seemed like angels who had only anticipated by a few\r\nyears their celestial and eternal union. The marriage was solemnized\r\nwith much pomp, and a few days after there was a feast in that very\r\nwainscotted chamber which you paused to remark was so gloomy. It was\r\nthat night hung with rich tapestry, representing the exploits of the\r\nCid, particularly that of his burning a few Moors who refused to\r\nrenounce their accursed religion. They were represented beautifully\r\ntortured, writhing and howling, and \xe2\x80\x9cMahomet! Mahomet!\xe2\x80\x9d issuing out of\r\ntheir mouths, as they called on him in their burning agonies;--you could\r\nalmost hear them scream. At the upper end of the room, under a splendid\r\nestrade, over which was an image of the blessed Virgin, sat Donna\r\nIsabella de Cardoza, mother to the bride, and near her Donna Ines, the\r\nbride, on rich almohadas; the bridegroom sat opposite to her; and though\r\nthey never spoke to each other, their eyes, slowly raised, but suddenly\r\nwithdrawn, (those eyes that blushed), told to each other the delicious\r\nsecret of their happiness. Don Pedro de Cardoza had assembled a large\r\nparty in honour of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s nuptials; among them was an Englishman\r\nof the name of _Melmoth_, a traveller; no one knew who had brought him\r\nthere. He sat silent like the rest, while the iced waters and the\r\nsugared wafers were presented to the company. The night was intensely\r\nhot, and the moon glowed like a sun over the ruins of Saguntum; the\r\nembroidered blinds flapped heavily, as if the wind made an effort to\r\nraise them in vain, and then desisted.\r\n\r\n(Another defect in the manuscript occurred here, but it was soon\r\nsupplied).\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe company were dispersed through various alleys of the garden; the\r\nbridegroom and bride wandered through one where the delicious perfume of\r\nthe orange trees mingled itself with that of the myrtles in blow. On\r\ntheir return to the hall, both of them asked, Had the company heard the\r\nexquisite sounds that floated through the garden just before they\r\nquitted it? No one had heard them. They expressed their surprise. The\r\nEnglishman had never quitted the hall; it was said he smiled with a most\r\nparticular and extraordinary expression as the remark was made. His\r\nsilence had been noticed before, but it was ascribed to his ignorance of\r\nthe Spanish language, an ignorance that Spaniards are not anxious either\r\nto expose or remove by speaking to a stranger. The subject of the music\r\nwas not again reverted to till the guests were seated at supper, when\r\nDonna Ines and her young husband, exchanging a smile of delighted\r\nsurprise, exclaimed they heard the same delicious sounds floating round\r\nthem. The guests listened, but no one else could hear it;--every one\r\nfelt there was something extraordinary in this. Hush! was uttered by\r\nevery voice almost at the same moment. A dead silence followed,--you\r\nwould think, from their intent looks, that they listened with their very\r\neyes. This deep silence, contrasted with the splendour of the feast, and\r\nthe light effused from torches held by the domestics, produced a\r\nsingular effect,--it seemed for some moments like an assembly of the\r\ndead. The silence was interrupted, though the cause of wonder had not\r\nceased, by the entrance of Father Olavida, the Confessor of Donna\r\nIsabella, who had been called away previous to the feast, to administer\r\nextreme unction to a dying man in the neighbourhood. He was a priest of\r\nuncommon sanctity, beloved in the family, and respected in the\r\nneighbourhood, where he had displayed uncommon taste and talents for\r\nexorcism;--in fact, this was the good Father\xe2\x80\x99s _forte_, and he piqued\r\nhimself on it accordingly. The devil never fell into worse hands than\r\nFather Olavida\xe2\x80\x99s, for when he was so contumacious as to resist Latin,\r\nand even the first verses of the Gospel of St John in Greek, which the\r\ngood Father never had recourse to but in cases of extreme stubbornness\r\nand difficulty,--(here Stanton recollected the English story of the _Boy\r\nof Bilson_, and blushed even in Spain for his countrymen),--then he\r\nalways applied to the Inquisition; and if the devils were ever so\r\nobstinate before, they were always seen to fly out of the possessed,\r\njust as, in the midst of their cries, (no doubt of blasphemy), they were\r\ntied to the stake. Some held out even till the flames surrounded them;\r\nbut even the most stubborn must have been dislodged when the operation\r\nwas over, for the devil himself could no longer tenant a crisp and\r\nglutinous lump of cinders. Thus Father Olavida\xe2\x80\x99s fame spread far and\r\nwide, and the Cardoza family had made uncommon interest to procure him\r\nfor a Confessor, and happily succeeded. The ceremony he had just been\r\nperforming, had cast a shade over the good Father\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, but it\r\ndispersed as he mingled among the guests, and was introduced to them.\r\nRoom was soon made for him, and he happened accidentally to be seated\r\nopposite the Englishman. As the wine was presented to him, Father\r\nOlavida, (who, as I observed, was a man of singular sanctity), prepared\r\nto utter a short internal prayer. He hesitated,--trembled,--desisted;\r\nand, putting down the wine, wiped the drops from his forehead with the\r\nsleeve of his habit. Donna Isabella gave a sign to a domestic, and other\r\nwine of a higher quality was offered to him. His lips moved, as if in\r\nthe effort to pronounce a benediction on it and the company, but the\r\neffort again failed; and the change in his countenance was so\r\nextraordinary, that it was perceived by all the guests. He felt the\r\nsensation that his extraordinary appearance excited, and attempted to\r\nremove it by again endeavouring to lift the cup to his lips. So strong\r\nwas the anxiety with which the company watched him, that the only sound\r\nheard in that spacious and crowded hall, was the rustling of his habit,\r\nas he attempted to lift the cup to his lips once more--in vain. The\r\nguests sat in astonished silence. Father Olavida alone remained\r\nstanding; but at that moment the Englishman rose, and appeared\r\ndetermined to fix Olavida\xe2\x80\x99s regards by a gaze like that of fascination.\r\nOlavida rocked, reeled, grasped the arm of a page, and at last, closing\r\nhis eyes for a moment, as if to escape the horrible fascination of that\r\nunearthly glare, (the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were observed by all the guests,\r\nfrom the moment of his entrance, to effuse a most fearful and\r\npreternatural lustre), exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is among us?--Who?--I cannot\r\nutter a blessing while he is here. I cannot feel one. Where he treads,\r\nthe earth is parched!--Where he breathes, the air is fire!--Where he\r\nfeeds, the food is poison!--Where he turns, his glance is\r\nlightning!--_Who is among us?_--_Who?_\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the priest in the agony\r\nof adjuration, while his cowl fallen back, his few thin hairs around the\r\nscalp instinct and alive with terrible emotion, his outspread arms\r\nprotruded from the sleeves of his habit, and extended towards the awful\r\nstranger, suggested the idea of an inspired being in the dreadful\r\nrapture of prophetic denunciation. He stood--still stood, and the\r\nEnglishman stood calmly opposite to him. There was an agitated\r\nirregularity in the attitudes of those around them, which contrasted\r\nstrongly the fixed and stern postures of those two, who remained gazing\r\nsilently at each other. \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows him?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Olavida, starting\r\napparently from a trance; \xe2\x80\x9cwho knows him? who brought him here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guests severally disclaimed all knowledge of the Englishman, and\r\neach asked the other in whispers, \xe2\x80\x9cwho _had_ brought him there?\xe2\x80\x9d Father\r\nOlavida then pointed his arm to each of the company, and asked each\r\nindividually, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo! no! no!\xe2\x80\x9d was uttered with vehement\r\nemphasis by every individual. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olavida, \xe2\x80\x9cby these\r\ncold drops!\xe2\x80\x9d and he wiped them off;--\xe2\x80\x9cby these convulsed joints!\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nattempted to sign the cross, but could not. He raised his voice, and\r\nevidently speaking with increased difficulty,--\xe2\x80\x9cBy this bread and wine,\r\nwhich the faithful receive as the body and blood of Christ, but which\r\n_his_ presence converts into matter as viperous as the suicide foam of\r\nthe dying Judas,--by all these--I know him, and command him to be\r\ngone!--He is--he is----\xe2\x80\x9d and he bent forwards as he spoke, and gazed on\r\nthe Englishman with an expression which the mixture of rage, hatred, and\r\nfear, rendered terrible. All the guests rose at these words,--the whole\r\ncompany now presented two singular groupes, that of the amazed guests\r\nall collected together, and repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cWho, what is he?\xe2\x80\x9d and that of\r\nthe Englishman, who stood unmoved, and Olavida, who dropped dead in the\r\nattitude of pointing to him. * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe body was removed into another room, and the departure of the\r\nEnglishman was not noticed till the company returned to the hall. They\r\nsat late together, conversing on this extraordinary circumstance, and\r\nfinally agreed to remain in the house, lest the evil spirit (for they\r\nbelieved the Englishman no better) should take certain liberties with\r\nthe corse by no means agreeable to a Catholic, particularly as he had\r\nmanifestly died without the benefit of the last sacraments. Just as this\r\nlaudable resolution was formed, they were roused by cries of horror and\r\nagony from the bridal-chamber, where the young pair had retired.\r\n\r\nThey hurried to the door, but the father was first. They burst it open,\r\nand found the bride a corse in the arms of her husband. * * * * * * * He\r\nnever recovered his reason; the family deserted the mansion rendered\r\nterrible by so many misfortunes. One apartment is still tenanted by the\r\nunhappy maniac; his were the cries you heard as you traversed the\r\ndeserted rooms. He is for the most part silent during the day, but at\r\nmidnight he always exclaims, in a voice frightfully piercing, and hardly\r\nhuman, \xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming! they are coming!\xe2\x80\x9d and relapses into profound\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of Father Olavida was attended by an extraordinary\r\ncircumstance. He was interred in a neighbouring convent; and the\r\nreputation of his sanctity, joined to the interest caused by his\r\nextraordinary death, collected vast numbers at the ceremony. His funeral\r\nsermon was preached by a monk of distinguished eloquence, appointed for\r\nthe purpose. To render the effect of his discourse more powerful, the\r\ncorse, extended on a bier, with its face uncovered, was placed in the\r\naisle. The monk took his text from one of the prophets,--\xe2\x80\x9cDeath is gone\r\nup into our palaces.\xe2\x80\x9d He expatiated on mortality, whose approach,\r\nwhether abrupt or lingering, is alike awful to man.--He spoke of the\r\nvicissitudes of empires with much eloquence and learning, but his\r\naudience were not observed to be much affected.--He cited various\r\npassages from the lives of the saints, descriptive of the glories of\r\nmartyrdom, and the heroism of those who had bled and blazed for Christ\r\nand his blessed mother, but they appeared still waiting for something to\r\ntouch them more deeply. When he inveighed against the tyrants under\r\nwhose bloody persecutions those holy men suffered, his hearers were\r\nroused for a moment, for it is always easier to excite a passion than a\r\nmoral feeling. But when he spoke of the dead, and pointed with emphatic\r\ngesture to the corse, as it lay before them cold and motionless, every\r\neye was fixed, and every ear became attentive. Even the lovers, who,\r\nunder pretence of dipping their fingers into the holy water, were\r\ncontriving to exchange amorous billets, forbore for one moment this\r\ninteresting intercourse, to listen to the preacher. He dwelt with much\r\nenergy on the virtues of the deceased, whom he declared to be a\r\nparticular favourite of the Virgin; and enumerating the various losses\r\nthat would be caused by his departure to the community to which he\r\nbelonged, to society, and to religion at large; he at last worked up\r\nhimself to a vehement expostulation with the Deity on the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nhast thou,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy hast thou, Oh God! thus dealt with us?\r\nWhy hast thou snatched from our sight this glorious saint, whose merits,\r\nif properly applied, doubtless would have been sufficient to atone for\r\nthe apostacy of St Peter, the opposition of St Paul, (previous to his\r\nconversion), and even the treachery of Judas himself? Why hast thou, Oh\r\nGod! snatched him from us?\xe2\x80\x9d--and a deep and hollow voice from among the\r\ncongregation answered,--\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he deserved his fate.\xe2\x80\x9d The murmurs of\r\napprobation with which the congregation honoured this apostrophe,\r\nhalf-drowned this extraordinary interruption; and though there was some\r\nlittle commotion in the immediate vicinity of the speaker, the rest of\r\nthe audience continued to listen intently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the\r\npreacher, pointing to the corse, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat hath laid thee there, servant of\r\nGod?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cPride, ignorance, and fear,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the same voice, in accents\r\nstill more thrilling. The disturbance now became universal. The preacher\r\npaused, and a circle opening, disclosed the figure of a monk belonging\r\nto the convent, who stood among them. * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter all the usual modes of admonition, exhortation, and discipline\r\nhad been employed, and the bishop of the diocese, who, under the report\r\nof these extraordinary circumstances, had visited the convent in person\r\nto obtain some explanation from the contumacious monk in vain, it was\r\nagreed, in a chapter extraordinary, to surrender him to the power of\r\nthe Inquisition. He testified great horror when this determination\r\nwas made known to him,--and offered to tell over and over again all\r\nthat he _could_ relate of the cause of Father Olavida\xe2\x80\x99s death. His\r\nhumiliation, and repeated offers of confession, came too late. He was\r\nconveyed to the Inquisition. The proceedings of that tribunal are\r\nrarely disclosed, but there is a secret report (I cannot answer for its\r\ntruth) of what he said and suffered there. On his first examination, he\r\nsaid he would relate all he _could_. He was told that was not enough,\r\nhe must relate all he knew. * * * * * * * * * \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you testify such\r\nhorror at the funeral of Father Olavida?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one testified horror\r\nand grief at the death of that venerable ecclesiastic, who died in the\r\nodour of sanctity. Had I done otherwise, it might have been reckoned\r\na proof of my guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you interrupt the preacher with such\r\nextraordinary exclamations?\xe2\x80\x9d--To this no answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you refuse\r\nto explain the meaning of those exclamations?\xe2\x80\x9d--No answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do\r\nyou persist in this obstinate and dangerous silence? Look, I beseech\r\nyou, brother, at the cross that is suspended against this wall,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe Inquisitor pointed to the large black crucifix at the back of the\r\nchair where he sat; \xe2\x80\x9cone drop of the blood shed there can purify you\r\nfrom all the sin you have ever committed; but all that blood, combined\r\nwith the intercession of the Queen of Heaven, and the merits of all\r\nits martyrs, nay, even the absolution of the Pope, cannot deliver you\r\nfrom the curse of dying in unrepented sin.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sin, then, have I\r\ncommitted?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest of all possible sins; you refuse answering\r\nthe questions put to you at the tribunal of the most holy and merciful\r\nInquisition;--you will not tell us what you know concerning the death\r\nof Father Olavida.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you that I believe he perished in\r\nconsequence of his ignorance and presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat proof can you\r\nproduce of that?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cHe sought the knowledge of a secret withheld from\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cThe secret of discovering the presence or\r\nagency of the evil power.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDo you possess that secret?\xe2\x80\x9d--After much\r\nagitation on the part of the prisoner, he said distinctly, but very\r\nfaintly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy master forbids me to disclose it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf your master were\r\nJesus Christ, he would not forbid you to obey the commands, or answer\r\nthe questions of the Inquisition.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d There was\r\na general outcry of horror at these words. The examination then went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you believed Olavida to be guilty of any pursuits or studies\r\ncondemned by our mother the church, why did you not denounce him to\r\nthe Inquisition?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I believed him not likely to be injured\r\nby such pursuits; his mind was too weak,--he died in the struggle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the prisoner with great emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou believe, then, it requires\r\nstrength of mind to keep those abominable secrets, when examined as to\r\ntheir nature and tendency?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I rather imagine strength of body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall try that presently,\xe2\x80\x9d said an Inquisitor, giving a signal for\r\nthe torture. * * * * * * * * * * * The prisoner underwent the first and\r\nsecond applications with unshrinking courage, but on the infliction of\r\nthe water-torture, which is indeed insupportable to humanity, either\r\nto suffer or relate, he exclaimed in the gasping interval, he would\r\ndisclose every thing. He was released, refreshed, restored, and the\r\nfollowing day uttered the following remarkable confession * * * * * * *\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nThe old Spanish woman further confessed to Stanton, that * * * * * * * *\r\n* and that the Englishman certainly had been seen in the neighbourhood\r\nsince;--seen, as she had heard, that very night. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat G--d!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nStanton, as he recollected the stranger whose demoniac laugh had so\r\nappalled him, while gazing on the lifeless bodies of the lovers, whom\r\nthe lightning had struck and blasted.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the manuscript, after a few blotted and illegible pages, became more\r\ndistinct, Melmoth read on, perplexed and unsatisfied, not knowing what\r\nconnexion this Spanish story could have with his ancestor, whom,\r\nhowever, he recognised under the title of _the Englishman_; and\r\nwondering how Stanton could have thought it worth his while to follow\r\nhim to Ireland, write a long manuscript about an event that occurred in\r\nSpain, and leave it in the hands of his family, to \xe2\x80\x9cverify untrue\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x9d in the language of Dogberry,--his wonder was diminished, though\r\nhis curiosity was still more inflamed, by the perusal of the next lines,\r\nwhich he made out with some difficulty. It seems Stanton was now in\r\nEngland. * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1677, Stanton was in London, his mind still full of his\r\nmysterious countryman. This constant subject of his contemplations had\r\nproduced a visible change in his exterior,--his walk was what Sallust\r\ntells us of Catiline\xe2\x80\x99s,--his were, too, the \xe2\x80\x9c_f\xc5\x93di oculi_.\xe2\x80\x9d He said to\r\nhimself every moment, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could but trace that being, I will not call\r\nhim man,\xe2\x80\x9d--and the next moment he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand what if I could?\xe2\x80\x9d In this\r\nstate of mind, it is singular enough that he mixed constantly in public\r\namusements, but it is true. When one fierce passion is devouring the\r\nsoul, we feel more than ever the necessity of external excitement; and\r\nour dependence on the world for temporary relief increases in direct\r\nproportion to our contempt of the world and all its works. He went\r\nfrequently to the theatres, _then_ fashionable, when\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe fair sat panting at a courtier\xe2\x80\x99s play,\r\n     And not a mask went unimproved away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe London theatres then presented a spectacle which ought for ever to\r\nput to silence the foolish outcry against progressive deterioration of\r\nmorals,--foolish even from the pen of Juvenal, and still more so from\r\nthe lips of a modern Puritan. Vice is always nearly on an average: The\r\nonly difference in life worth tracing, is that of manners, and there we\r\nhave manifestly the advantage of our ancestors. Hypocrisy is said to be\r\nthe homage that vice pays to virtue,--decorum is the outward expression\r\nof that homage; and if this be so, we must acknowledge that vice has\r\nlatterly grown very humble indeed. There was, however, something\r\nsplendid, ostentatious, and obtrusive, in the vices of Charles the\r\nSecond\xe2\x80\x99s reign.--A view of the theatres alone proved it, when Stanton\r\nwas in the habit of visiting them. At the doors stood on one side the\r\nfootmen of a fashionable nobleman, (with arms concealed under their\r\nliveries), surrounding the sedan of a popular actress(1), whom they were\r\nto carry off _vi et armis_, as she entered it at the end of the play. At\r\nthe other side waited the _glass coach_ of a woman of fashion, who\r\nwaited to take Kynaston (the Adonis of the day), in his female dress, to\r\nthe park after the play was over, and exhibit him in all the luxurious\r\nsplendour of effeminate beauty, (heightened by theatrical dress), for\r\nwhich he was so distinguished.\r\n\r\n  (1) Mrs Marshall, the original Roxana in Lee\xe2\x80\x99s Alexander, and the only\r\n  virtuous woman then on the stage. She was carried off in the manner\r\n  described, by Lord Orrery, who, finding all his solicitations\r\n  repelled, had recourse to a sham marriage performed by a servant in\r\n  the habit of a clergyman.\r\n\r\nPlays being then performed at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, allowed ample time for the\r\nevening drive, and the midnight assignation, when the parties met by\r\ntorch-light, masked, in St James\xe2\x80\x99s park, and verified the title of\r\nWycherly\xe2\x80\x99s play, \xe2\x80\x9cLove in a Wood.\xe2\x80\x9d The boxes, as Stanton looked round\r\nhim, were filled with females, whose naked shoulders and bosoms, well\r\ntestified in the paintings of Lely, and the pages of Grammont, might\r\nsave modern puritanism many a vituperative groan and affected\r\nreminiscence. They had all taken the precaution to send some male\r\nrelative, on the first night of a new play, to report whether it was fit\r\nfor persons of \xe2\x80\x9chonour and reputation\xe2\x80\x9d to appear at; but in spite of\r\nthis precaution, at certain passages (which occurred about every second\r\nsentence) they were compelled to spread out their fans, or play with the\r\nstill cherished love-lock, which Prynne himself had not been able to\r\nwrite down.\r\n\r\nThe men in the boxes were composed of two distinct classes, the \xe2\x80\x9cmen of\r\nwit and pleasure about town,\xe2\x80\x9d distinguished by their Flanders lace\r\ncravats, soiled with snuff, their diamond rings, the pretended gift of a\r\nroyal mistress, (_n\xe2\x80\x99importe_ whether the Duchess of Portsmouth or Nell\r\nGwynne); their uncombed wigs, whose curls descended to their waists, and\r\nthe loud and careless tone in which they abused Dryden, Lee, and Otway,\r\nand quoted Sedley and Rochester;--the other class were the lovers, the\r\ngentle \xe2\x80\x9csquires of dames,\xe2\x80\x9d equally conspicuous for their white fringed\r\ngloves, their obsequious bows, and their commencing every sentence\r\naddressed to a lady, with the profane exclamation of (2) \xe2\x80\x9cOh Jesu!\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nthe softer, but equally unmeaning one of \xe2\x80\x9cI beseech you, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d or,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, I burn(3).\xe2\x80\x9d One circumstance sufficiently extraordinary marked\r\nthe manners of the day; females had not then found their proper level in\r\nlife; they were alternately adored as goddesses, and assailed as\r\nprostitutes; and the man who, this moment, addressed his mistress in\r\nlanguage borrowed from Orondates worshipping Cassandra, in the next\r\naccosted her with ribaldry that might put to the blush the piazzas of\r\nCovent Garden(4).\r\n\r\n  (2) Vide Pope, (copying from Donne).\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPeace, fools, or Gonson will for Papists seize you,\r\n       If once he catch you at your Jesu, Jesu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  (3) Vide the Old Bachelor, whose Araminta, wearied by the repetition\r\n  of these phrases, forbids her lover to address her in any sentence\r\n  commencing with them.\r\n\r\n  (4) Vide any old play you may have the patience to peruse; or, _instar\r\n  omnium_, read the courtly loves of Rodolphil and Melantha, Palamede\r\n  and Doratice, in Dryden\xe2\x80\x99s Marriage a la Mode.\r\n\r\nThe pit presented a more various spectacle. There were the critics armed\r\ncap-a-pee from Aristotle and Bossu; these men dined at twelve, dictated\r\nat a coffee-house till four, then called to the boy to brush their\r\nshoes, and strode to the theatre, where, till the curtain rose, they sat\r\nhushed in grim repose, and expecting their evening prey. There were the\r\ntemplars, spruce, pert, and loquacious; and here and there a sober\r\ncitizen, doffing his steeple-crowned hat, and hiding his little band\r\nunder the folds of his huge puritanic cloke, while his eyes, declined\r\nwith an expression half leering, half ejaculatory, towards a masked\r\nfemale, muffled in a hood and scarf, testified what had seduced him into\r\nthese \xe2\x80\x9ctents of Kedar.\xe2\x80\x9d There were females, too, but all in vizard\r\nmasks, which, though worn as well as aunt Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s in Tristram Shandy,\r\nserved to conceal them from the \xe2\x80\x9cyoung bubbles\xe2\x80\x9d they were in quest of,\r\nand from all but the orange-women, who hailed them loudly as they passed\r\nthe doors(5). In the galleries were the happy souls who waited for the\r\nfulfilment of Dryden\xe2\x80\x99s promise in one of his prologues(6); no matter to\r\nthem whether it were the ghost of Almanzor\xe2\x80\x99s mother in her dripping\r\nshroud, or that of Laius, who, according to the stage directions, rises\r\nin his chariot, armed with the ghosts of his three murdered attendants\r\nbehind him;--a joke that did not escape l\xe2\x80\x99Abbe le Blanc(7), in his\r\nrecipe for writing an English tragedy. Some, indeed, from time to time\r\ncalled out for the \xe2\x80\x9cburning of the Pope;\xe2\x80\x9d but though\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSpace was obedient to the boundless piece,\r\n     Which oped in Mexico and closed in Greece,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nit was not always possible to indulge them in this laudable amusement,\r\nas the scene of the popular plays was generally laid in Africa or Spain;\r\nSir Robert Howard, Elkanah Settle, and John Dryden, all agreeing in\r\ntheir choice of Spanish and Moorish subjects for their principal plays.\r\nAmong this joyous groupe were seated several women of fashion masked,\r\nenjoying in secrecy the licentiousness which they dared not openly\r\npatronise, and verifying Gay\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic description, though it was\r\nwritten many years later,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMobbed in the gallery Laura sits secure,\r\n     And laughs at jests that turn the box demure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStanton gazed on all this with the look of one who \xe2\x80\x9ccould not be moved\r\nto smile at any thing.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to the stage, the play was Alexander,\r\nthen acted as written by Lee, and the principal character was performed\r\nby Hart, whose god-like ardour in making love, is said almost to have\r\ncompelled the audience to believe that they beheld the \xe2\x80\x9cson of Ammon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  (5) Vide Southern\xe2\x80\x99s Oroonoko,--I mean the comic part.\r\n\r\n  (6) \xe2\x80\x9cA charm, a song, a murder, and a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      _Prologue to \xc5\x92dipus._\r\n\r\n  (7) Vide Le Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s Letters.\r\n\r\nThere were absurdities enough to offend a classical, or even a rational\r\nspectator. There were Grecian heroes with roses in their shoes, feathers\r\nin their hats, and wigs down to their waists; and Persian princesses in\r\nstiff stays and powdered hair. But the illusion of the scene was well\r\nsustained, for the heroines were rivals in real as well as theatrical\r\nlife. It was that memorable night, when, according to the history of the\r\nveteran Betterton(8), Mrs Barry, who personated Roxana, had a green-room\r\nsquabble with Mrs Bowtell, the representative of Statira, about a veil,\r\nwhich the partiality of the property-man adjudged to the latter. Roxana\r\nsuppressed her rage till the fifth act, when, stabbing Statira, she\r\naimed the blow with such force as to pierce through her stays, and\r\ninflict a severe though not dangerous wound. Mrs Bowtell fainted, the\r\nperformance was suspended, and, in the commotion which this incident\r\ncaused in the house, many of the audience rose, and Stanton among them.\r\nIt was at this moment that, in a seat opposite to him, he discovered the\r\nobject of his search for four years,--the Englishman whom he had met in\r\nthe plains of Valentia, and whom he believed the same with the subject\r\nof the extraordinary narrative he had heard there.\r\n\r\n  (8) Vide Betterton\xe2\x80\x99s History of the Stage.\r\n\r\nHe was standing up. There was nothing particular or remarkable in his\r\nappearance, but the expression of his eyes could never be mistaken or\r\nforgotten. The heart of Stanton palpitated with violence,--a mist\r\noverspread his eyes,--a nameless and deadly sickness, accompanied with a\r\ncreeping sensation in every pore, from which cold drops were gushing,\r\nannounced the * * * * * * * * * * Before he had well recovered, a strain\r\nof music, soft, solemn, and delicious, breathed round him, audibly\r\nascending from the ground, and increasing in sweetness and power till it\r\nseemed to fill the whole building. Under the sudden impulse of amazement\r\nand pleasure, he inquired of some around him from whence those exquisite\r\nsounds arose. But, by the manner in which he was answered, it was plain\r\nthat those he addressed considered him insane; and, indeed, the\r\nremarkable change in his expression might well justify the suspicion. He\r\nthen remembered that night in Spain, when the same sweet and mysterious\r\nsounds were heard only by the young bridegroom and bride, of whom the\r\nlatter perished on that very night. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I then to be the next\r\nvictim?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Stanton; \xe2\x80\x9cand are those celestial sounds, that seem to\r\nprepare us for heaven, only intended to announce the presence of an\r\nincarnate fiend, who mocks the devoted with \xe2\x80\x98airs from heaven,\xe2\x80\x99 while he\r\nprepares to surround them with \xe2\x80\x98blasts from hell\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d It is very singular\r\nthat at this moment, when his imagination had reached its highest pitch\r\nof elevation,--when the object he had pursued so long and fruitlessly,\r\nhad in one moment become as it were tangible to the grasp both of mind\r\nand body,--when this spirit, with whom he had wrestled in darkness, was\r\nat last about to declare its name, that Stanton began to feel a kind of\r\ndisappointment at the futility of his pursuits, like Bruce at\r\ndiscovering the source of the Nile, or Gibbon on concluding his History.\r\nThe feeling which he had dwelt on so long, that he had actually\r\nconverted it into a duty, was after all mere curiosity; but what passion\r\nis more insatiable, or more capable of giving a kind of romantic\r\ngrandeur to all its wanderings and eccentricities? Curiosity is in one\r\nrespect like love, it always compromises between the object and the\r\nfeeling; and provided the latter possesses sufficient energy, no matter\r\nhow contemptible the former may be. A child might have smiled at the\r\nagitation of Stanton, caused as it was by the accidental appearance of a\r\nstranger; but no man, in the full energy of his passions, was there, but\r\nmust have trembled at the horrible agony of emotion with which he felt\r\napproaching, with sudden and irresistible velocity, the crisis of his\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nWhen the play was over, he stood for some moments in the deserted\r\nstreets. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and he saw near him a\r\nfigure, whose shadow, projected half across the street, (there were no\r\nflagged ways then, chains and posts were the only defence of the\r\nfoot-passenger), appeared to him of gigantic magnitude. He had been so\r\nlong accustomed to contend with these phantoms of the imagination, that\r\nhe took a kind of stubborn delight in subduing them. He walked up to the\r\nobject, and observing the shadow only was magnified, and the figure was\r\nthe ordinary height of man, he approached it, and discovered the very\r\nobject of his search,--the man whom he had seen for a moment in\r\nValentia, and, after a search of four years, recognised at the theatre.\r\n* * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were in quest of me?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI was.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any thing to inquire of\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cMuch.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, then.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no place.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo place! poor\r\nwretch, I am independent of time and place. Speak, if you have any thing\r\nto ask or to learn?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI have many things to ask, but nothing to learn,\r\nI hope, from you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou deceive yourself, but you will be undeceived\r\nwhen next we meet.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when shall that be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stanton, grasping\r\nhis arm; \xe2\x80\x9cname your hour and your place.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe hour shall be mid-day,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered the stranger, with a horrid and unintelligible smile; \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nplace shall be the bare walls of a mad-house, where you shall rise\r\nrattling in your chains, and rustling from your straw, to greet me,--yet\r\nstill you shall have _the curse of sanity_, and of memory. My voice\r\nshall ring in your ears till then, and the glance of these eyes shall be\r\nreflected from every object, animate or inanimate, till you behold them\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it under circumstances so horrible we are to meet again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Stanton, shrinking under the full-lighted blaze of those demon\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI never,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, in an emphatic tone,--\xe2\x80\x9cI _never\r\ndesert my friends in misfortune_. When they are plunged in the lowest\r\nabyss of human calamity, _they are sure to be visited by me_.\xe2\x80\x9d * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe narrative, when Melmoth was again able to trace its continuation,\r\ndescribed Stanton, some years after, plunged in a state the most\r\ndeplorable.\r\n\r\nHe had been always reckoned of a singular turn of mind, and the belief\r\nof this, aggravated by his constant talk of Melmoth, his wild pursuit of\r\nhim, his strange behaviour at the theatre, and his dwelling on the\r\nvarious particulars of their extraordinary meetings, with all the\r\nintensity of the deepest conviction, (while he never could impress them\r\non any one\xe2\x80\x99s conviction but his own), suggested to some prudent people\r\nthe idea that he was deranged. Their malignity probably took part with\r\ntheir prudence. The selfish Frenchman(9) says, we feel a pleasure even\r\nin the misfortunes of our friends,--_a plus forte_ in those of our\r\nenemies; and as every one is an enemy to a man of genius of course, the\r\nreport of Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s malady was propagated with infernal and successful\r\nindustry. Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s next relative, a needy unprincipled man, watched the\r\nreport in its circulation, and saw the snares closing round his victim.\r\nHe waited on him one morning, accompanied by a person of a grave, though\r\nsomewhat repulsive appearance. Stanton was as usual abstracted and\r\nrestless, and, after a few moments conversation, he proposed a drive a\r\nfew miles out of London, which he said would revive and refresh him.\r\nStanton objected, on account of the difficulty of getting a hackney\r\ncoach, (for it is singular that at this period the number of private\r\nequipages, though infinitely fewer than they are now, exceeded the\r\nnumber of hired ones), and proposed going by water. This, however, did\r\nnot suit the kinsman\xe2\x80\x99s views; and, after pretending to send for a\r\ncarriage, (which was in waiting at the end of the street), Stanton and\r\nhis companions entered it, and drove about two miles out of London.\r\n\r\n  (9) Rochefoucault.\r\n\r\nThe carriage then stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger\r\nStanton,--\xe2\x80\x9ccome and view a purchase I have made.\xe2\x80\x9d Stanton absently\r\nalighted, and followed him across a small paved court; the other person\r\nfollowed. \xe2\x80\x9cIn troth, Cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stanton, \xe2\x80\x9cyour choice appears not to\r\nhave been discreetly made; your house has something of a gloomy\r\naspect.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cHold you content, Cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall take\r\norder that you like it better, when you have been some time a dweller\r\ntherein.\xe2\x80\x9d Some attendants of a mean appearance, and with most suspicious\r\nvisages, awaited them on their entrance, and they ascended a narrow\r\nstaircase, which led to a room meanly furnished. \xe2\x80\x9cWait here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nkinsman, to the man who accompanied them, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I go for company to\r\ndivertise my cousin in his loneliness.\xe2\x80\x9d They were left alone. Stanton\r\ntook no notice of his companion, but as usual seized the first book near\r\nhim, and began to read. It was a volume in manuscript,--they were then\r\nmuch more common than now.\r\n\r\nThe first lines struck him as indicating insanity in the writer. It was\r\na wild proposal (written apparently after the great fire of London) to\r\nrebuild it with stone, and attempting to prove, on a calculation wild,\r\nfalse, and yet sometimes plausible, that this could be done out of the\r\ncolossal fragments of Stonehenge, which the writer proposed to remove\r\nfor that purpose. Subjoined were several grotesque drawings of engines\r\ndesigned to remove those massive blocks, and in a corner of the page was\r\na note,--\xe2\x80\x9cI would have drawn these more accurately, but was not allowed\r\n_a knife_ to mend my pen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next was entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cA modest proposal for the spreading of\r\nChristianity in foreign parts, whereby it is hoped its entertainment\r\nwill become general all over the world.\xe2\x80\x9d--This modest proposal was, to\r\nconvert the Turkish ambassadors, (who had been in London a few years\r\nbefore), by offering them their choice of being strangled on the spot,\r\nor becoming Christians. Of course the writer reckoned on their embracing\r\nthe easier alternative, but even this was to be clogged with a heavy\r\ncondition,--namely, that they must be bound before a magistrate to\r\nconvert twenty mussulmans a day, on their return to Turkey. The rest of\r\nthe pamphlet was reasoned very much in the conclusive style of Captain\r\nBobadil,--these twenty will convert twenty more a piece, and these two\r\nhundred converts, converting their due number in the same time, all\r\nTurkey would be converted before the Grand Signior knew where he was.\r\nThen comes the _coup d\xe2\x80\x99eclat_,--one fine morning, every minaret in\r\nConstantinople was to ring out with bells, instead of the cry of the\r\nMuezzins; and the Imaum, coming out to see what was the matter, was to\r\nbe encountered by the Archbishop of Canterbury, _in pontificalibus_,\r\nperforming Cathedral service in the church of St Sophia, which was to\r\nfinish the business. Here an objection appeared to arise, which the\r\ningenuity of the writer had anticipated.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be redargued,\xe2\x80\x9d saith\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cby those who have more spleen than brain, that forasmuch as the\r\nArchbishop preacheth in English, he will not thereby much edify the\r\nTurkish folk, who do altogether hold in a vain gabble of their own.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nthis (to use his own language) he \xe2\x80\x9cevites,\xe2\x80\x9d by judiciously observing,\r\nthat where service was performed in an unknown tongue, the devotion of\r\nthe people was always observed to be much increased thereby; as, for\r\ninstance, in the church of Rome,--that St Augustine, with his monks,\r\nadvanced to meet King Ethelbert singing litanies, (in a language his\r\nmajesty could not possibly have understood), and converted him and his\r\nwhole court on the spot;--that the sybilline books * * * * * * * * _Cum\r\nmultis aliis._\r\n\r\nBetween the pages were cut most exquisitely in paper the likenesses of\r\nsome of these Turkish ambassadors; the hair of the beards, in\r\nparticular, was feathered with a delicacy of touch that seemed the work\r\nof fairy fingers,--but the pages ended with a complaint of the operator,\r\nthat his _scissars had been taken from him_. However, he consoled\r\nhimself and the reader with the assurance, that he would that night\r\ncatch a moon-beam as it entered through the grating, and, when he had\r\nwhetted it on the iron knobs of his door, would do wonders with it. In\r\nthe next page was found a melancholy proof of powerful but prostrated\r\nintellect. It contained some insane lines, ascribed to Lee the dramatic\r\npoet, commencing,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cO that my lungs could bleat like buttered pease,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\r\n\r\nThere is no proof whatever that these miserable lines were really\r\nwritten by Lee, except that the measure is the fashionable quatrain of\r\nthe period. It is singular that Stanton read on without suspicion of his\r\nown danger, quite absorbed in _the album of a mad-house_, without ever\r\nreflecting on the place where he was, and which such compositions too\r\nmanifestly designated.\r\n\r\nIt was after a long interval that he looked round, and perceived that\r\nhis companion was gone. Bells were unusual then. He proceeded to the\r\ndoor,--it was fastened. He called aloud,--his voice was echoed in a\r\nmoment by many others, but in tones so wild and discordant, that he\r\ndesisted in involuntary terror. As the day advanced, and no one\r\napproached, he tried the window, and then perceived for the first time\r\nit was grated. It looked out on the narrow flagged yard, in which no\r\nhuman being was; and if there had, from such a being no human feeling\r\ncould have been extracted.\r\n\r\nSickening with unspeakable horror, he sunk rather than sat down beside\r\nthe miserable window, and \xe2\x80\x9cwished for day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nAt midnight he started from a doze, half a swoon, half a sleep, which\r\nprobably the hardness of his seat, and of the deal table on which he\r\nleaned, had not contributed to prolong.\r\n\r\nHe was in complete darkness; the horror of his situation struck him at\r\nonce, and for a moment he was indeed almost qualified for an inmate of\r\nthat dreadful mansion. He felt his way to the door, shook it with\r\ndesperate strength, and uttered the most frightful cries, mixed with\r\nexpostulations and commands. His cries were in a moment echoed by a\r\nhundred voices. In maniacs there is a peculiar malignity, accompanied by\r\nan extraordinary acuteness of some of the senses, particularly in\r\ndistinguishing the voice of a stranger. The cries that he heard on every\r\nside seemed like a wild and infernal yell of joy, that their mansion of\r\nmisery had obtained another tenant.\r\n\r\nHe paused, exhausted,--a quick and thundering step was heard in the\r\npassage. The door was opened, and a man of savage appearance stood at\r\nthe entrance,--two more were seen indistinctly in the passage.--\xe2\x80\x9cRelease\r\nme, villain!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cStop, my fine fellow, what\xe2\x80\x99s all this noise for?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nam I?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere you ought to be.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWill you dare to detain me?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and\r\na little more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the ruffian, applying a loaded\r\nhorse-whip to his back and shoulders, till the patient soon fell to the\r\nground convulsed with rage and pain. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you see you are where you\r\nought to be,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the ruffian, brandishing the horse-whip over him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand now take the advice of a friend, and make no more noise. The lads\r\nare ready for you with the darbies, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll clink them on in the\r\ncrack of this whip, unless you prefer another touch of it first.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nthen were advancing into the room as he spoke, with fetters in their\r\nhands, (strait waistcoats being then little known or used), and shewed,\r\nby their frightful countenances and gestures, no unwillingness to apply\r\nthem. Their harsh rattle on the stone pavement made Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s blood run\r\ncold; the effect, however, was useful. He had the presence of mind to\r\nacknowledge his (supposed) miserable condition, to supplicate the\r\nforbearance of the ruthless keeper, and promise complete submission to\r\nhis orders. This pacified the ruffian, and he retired.\r\n\r\nStanton collected all his resolution to encounter the horrible night; he\r\nsaw all that was before him, and summoned himself to meet it. After much\r\nagitated deliberation, he conceived it best to continue the same\r\nappearance of submission and tranquillity, hoping that thus he might in\r\ntime either propitiate the wretches in whose hands he was, or, by his\r\napparent inoffensiveness, procure such opportunities of indulgence, as\r\nmight perhaps ultimately facilitate his escape. He therefore determined\r\nto conduct himself with the utmost tranquillity, and never to let his\r\nvoice be heard in the house; and he laid down several other resolutions\r\nwith a degree of prudence which he already shuddered to think might be\r\nthe cunning of incipient madness, or the beginning result of the horrid\r\nhabits of the place.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were put to desperate trial that very night. Just next\r\nto Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s apartment were lodged two most uncongenial neighbours. One\r\nof them was a puritanical weaver, who had been driven mad by a single\r\nsermon from the celebrated Hugh Peters, and was sent to the mad-house as\r\nfull of election and reprobation as he could hold,--and fuller. He\r\nregularly repeated over the _five points_ while day-light lasted, and\r\nimagined himself preaching in a conventicle with distinguished success;\r\ntowards twilight his visions were more gloomy, and at midnight his\r\nblasphemies became horrible. In the opposite cell was lodged a loyalist\r\ntailor, who had been ruined by giving credit to the cavaliers and their\r\nladies,--(for at this time, and much later, down to the reign of Anne,\r\ntailors were employed by females even _to make_ and _fit on their\r\nstays_),--who had run mad with drink and loyalty on the burning of the\r\nRump, and ever since had made the cells of the mad-house echo with\r\nfragments of the ill-fated Colonel Lovelace\xe2\x80\x99s songs, scraps from\r\nCowley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCutter of Coleman street,\xe2\x80\x9d and some curious specimens from Mrs\r\nAphra Behn\xe2\x80\x99s plays, where the cavaliers are denominated the _heroicks_,\r\nand Lady Lambert and Lady Desborough represented as going to meeting,\r\ntheir large Bibles carried before them by their pages, and falling in\r\nlove with two banished cavaliers by the way.--\xe2\x80\x9cTabitha, Tabitha,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\na voice half in exultation and half in derision; \xe2\x80\x9cthou shalt go with thy\r\nhair curled, and thy breasts naked;\xe2\x80\x9d--and then added in an affected\r\nvoice,--\xe2\x80\x9cI could dance the Canaries once, spouse.\xe2\x80\x9d This never failed to\r\nrouse the feelings, or rather operate on the instincts of the puritanic\r\nweaver, who immediately answered, \xe2\x80\x9cColonel Harrison shall come out of\r\nthe west, riding on a sky-coloured mule, which signifies\r\ninstruction(10).\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYe lie, ye round-head son of a b----h,\xe2\x80\x9d roared the\r\ncavalier tailor, \xe2\x80\x9cColonel Harrison will be damned before he ever mounts\r\na sky-coloured mule;\xe2\x80\x9d and he concluded this pithy sentence with\r\nfragments of anti-Oliverian songs.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd may I live to see\r\n     Old Noll upon a tree,\r\n     And many such as he;\r\n     Confound him, confound him,\r\n     Diseases all around him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  (10) Vide Cutter of Coleman street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are honest gentlemen, I can play many tunes,\xe2\x80\x9d squeaked a poor mad\r\nloyalist fiddler, who had been accustomed to play in the taverns to the\r\ncavalier party, and just remembered the words of a similar minstrel\r\nplaying for Colonel Blunt in the committee. \xe2\x80\x9cThen play me the air to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebellion is breaking up house,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the tailor, dancing wildly\r\nabout his cell (as far as his chains allowed him) to an imaginary\r\nmeasure. The weaver could contain no longer. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long, Lord, how long,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cshall thine enemies insult thy sanctuary, in which I have\r\nbeen placed an anointed teacher? even here, where I am placed to preach\r\nto the souls in prison?--Open the flood-gates of thy power, and though\r\nthy waves and storms go over me, let me testify in the midst of them,\r\neven as he who spreadeth forth his hands to swim may raise one of them\r\nto warn his companion that he is about to sink.--Sister Ruth, why dost\r\nthou uncover thy bosom to discover my frailty?--Lord, let thine arm of\r\npower be with us as it was when thou brakest the shield, the sword, and\r\nthe battle,--when thy foot was dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and\r\nthe tongue of thy dogs was red through the same.--Dip all thy garments\r\nin blood, and let me weave thee fresh when thou art stained.--When shall\r\nthy saints tread the wine-press of thy wrath? Blood! blood! the saints\r\ncall for it, earth gapes to swallow it, hell thirsts for it!--Sister\r\nRuth, I pray thee, conceal thy bosom, and be not as the vain women of\r\nthis generation.--Oh for a day like that, a day of the Lord of hosts,\r\nwhen the towers fell!--Spare me in the battle, for I am not a mighty man\r\nof war; leave me in the rear of the host, to curse, with the curse of\r\nMeroz, those who come not to the help of the Lord against the\r\nmighty,--even to curse this malignant tailor,--yea, curse him\r\nbitterly.--Lord, I am in the tents of Kedar, my feet stumble on the dark\r\nmountains,--I fall,--I fall!\xe2\x80\x9d--And the poor wretch, exhausted by his\r\ndelirious agonies, fell, and grovelled for some time in his straw. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\r\nI have had a grievous fall,--Sister Ruth,--Oh Sister Ruth!--Rejoice not\r\nagainst me, Oh mine enemy! though I fall, I shall rise again.\xe2\x80\x9d Whatever\r\nsatisfaction Sister Ruth might have derived from this assurance, if she\r\ncould have heard it, was enjoyed tenfold by the weaver, whose amorous\r\nreminiscences were in a moment exchanged for war-like ones, borrowed\r\nfrom a wretched and disarranged mass of intellectual rubbish. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord\r\nis a man of war,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.--\xe2\x80\x9cLook to Marston Moor!--Look to the city,\r\nthe proud city, full of pride and sin!--Look to the waves of the Severn,\r\nas red with blood as the waves of the Red Sea!--There were the hoofs\r\nbroken by means of the prancings, the prancings of the mighty\r\nones.--Then, Lord, was thy triumph, and the triumph of thy saints, to\r\nbind their kings in chains, and their nobles in links of iron.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nmalignant tailor burst out in his turn: \xe2\x80\x9cThank the false Scots, and\r\ntheir solemn league and covenant, and Carisbrook Castle, for that, ye\r\ncrop-eared Puritan,\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it had not been for them, I would\r\nhave taken measure of the king for a velvet cloak as high as the Tower\r\nof London, and one flirt of its folds would have knocked the \xe2\x80\x9ccopper\r\nnose\xe2\x80\x9d into the Thames, and sent it a-drift to Hell.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYe lie, in your\r\nteeth,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the weaver; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will prove it unarmed, with my shuttle\r\nagainst your needle, and smite you to the earth thereafter, as David\r\nsmote Goliath. It was _the man\xe2\x80\x99s_ (such was the indecent language in\r\nwhich Charles the First was spoken of by the Puritans)--it was the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncarnal, self-seeking, world-loving, prelatical hierarchy, that drove the\r\ngodly to seek the sweet word in season from their own pastors, who\r\nrighteously abominated the Popish garniture of lawn-sleeves, lewd\r\norgans, and steeple houses. Sister Ruth, tempt me not with that calf\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, it is all streaming with blood;--drop it, I beseech thee, sister,\r\nit is unmeet in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand, though the brethren drink of it.--Woe be\r\nunto thee, gainsayer, dost thou not see how flames envelope the accursed\r\ncity under his Arminian and Popish son?--London is on fire!--on fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe yelled; \xe2\x80\x9cand the brands are lit by the half-papist, whole-arminian,\r\nall-damned people thereof.--Fire!--fire!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice in which he shrieked\r\nout the last words was powerfully horrible, but it was like the moan of\r\nan infant, compared to the voice which took up and re-echoed the cry, in\r\na tone that made the building shake. It was the voice of a maniac, who\r\nhad lost her husband, children, subsistence, and finally her reason, in\r\nthe dreadful fire of London. The cry of fire never failed to operate\r\nwith terrible punctuality on her associations. She had been in a\r\ndisturbed sleep, and now started from it as suddenly as on that dreadful\r\nnight. It was Saturday night, too, and she was always observed to be\r\nparticularly violent on that night,--it was the terrible weekly festival\r\nof insanity with her. She was awake, and busy in a moment escaping from\r\nthe flames; and she dramatized the whole scene with such hideous\r\nfidelity, that Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s resolution was far more in danger from her than\r\nfrom the battle between his neighbours _Testimony_ and _Hothead_. She\r\nbegan exclaiming she was suffocated by the smoke; then she sprung from\r\nher bed, calling for a light, and appeared to be struck by the sudden\r\nglare that burst through her casement.--\xe2\x80\x9cThe last day,\xe2\x80\x9d she shrieked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last day! The very heavens are on fire!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cThat will not come till\r\nthe Man of Sin be first destroyed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the weaver; \xe2\x80\x9cthou ravest of\r\nlight and fire, and yet thou art in utter darkness.--I pity thee, poor\r\nmad soul, I pity thee!\xe2\x80\x9d The maniac never heeded him; she appeared to be\r\nscrambling up a stair-case to her children\xe2\x80\x99s room. She exclaimed she was\r\nscorched, singed, suffocated; her courage appeared to fail, and she\r\nretreated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my children are there!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried in a voice of\r\nunspeakable agony, as she seemed to make another effort; \xe2\x80\x9chere I\r\nam--here I am come to save you.--Oh God! They are all blazing!--Take\r\nthis arm--no, not that, it is scorched and disabled--well, any arm--take\r\nhold of my clothes--no, they are blazing too!--Well, take me all on fire\r\nas I am!--And their hair, how it hisses!--Water, one drop of water for\r\nmy youngest--he is but an infant--for my youngest, and let me burn!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npaused in horrid silence, to watch the fall of a blazing rafter that was\r\nabout to shatter the stair-case on which she stood.--\xe2\x80\x9cThe roof has\r\nfallen on my head!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe earth is weak, and all the\r\ninhabitants thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d chaunted the weaver; \xe2\x80\x9cI bear up the pillars of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maniac marked the destruction of the spot where she thought\r\nshe stood by one desperate bound, accompanied by a wild shriek, and\r\nthen calmly gazed on her infants as they rolled over the scorching\r\nfragments, and sunk into the abyss of fire below. \xe2\x80\x9cThere they\r\ngo,--one--two--three--all!\xe2\x80\x9d and her voice sunk into low mutterings, and\r\nher convulsions into faint, cold shudderings, like the sobbings of a\r\nspent storm, as she imagined herself to \xe2\x80\x9cstand in safety and despair,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\namid the thousand houseless wretches assembled in the suburbs of London\r\non the dreadful nights after the fire, without food, roof, or raiment,\r\nall gazing on the burning ruins of their dwellings and their property.\r\nShe seemed to listen to their complaints, and even repeated some of them\r\nvery affectingly, but invariably answered them with the same words, \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nI have lost all my children--_all_!\xe2\x80\x9d It was remarkable, that when this\r\nsufferer began to rave, all the others became silent. The cry of nature\r\nhushed every other cry,--she was the only patient in the house who was\r\nnot mad from politics, religion, ebriety, or some perverted passion; and\r\nterrifying as the out-break of her frenzy always was, Stanton used to\r\nawait it as a kind of relief from the dissonant, melancholy, and\r\nludicrous ravings of the others.\r\n\r\nBut the utmost efforts of his resolution began to sink under the\r\ncontinued horrors of the place. The impression on his senses began to\r\ndefy the power of reason to resist them. He could not shut out these\r\nfrightful cries nightly repeated, nor the frightful sound of the whip\r\nemployed to still them. Hope began to fail him, as he observed, that the\r\nsubmissive tranquillity (which he had imagined, by obtaining increased\r\nindulgence, might contribute to his escape, or perhaps convince the\r\nkeeper of his sanity) was interpreted by the callous ruffian, who was\r\nacquainted only with the varieties of _madness_, as a more refined\r\nspecies of that cunning which he was well accustomed to watch and\r\nbaffle.\r\n\r\nOn his first discovery of his situation, he had determined to take the\r\nutmost care of his health and intellect that the place allowed, as the\r\nsole basis of his hope of deliverance. But as that hope declined, he\r\nneglected the means of realizing it. He had at first risen early, walked\r\nincessantly about his cell, and availed himself of every opportunity of\r\nbeing in the open air. He took the strictest care of his person in point\r\nof cleanliness, and with or without appetite, regularly forced down his\r\nmiserable meals; and all these efforts were even pleasant, as long as\r\nhope prompted them. But now he began to relax them all. He passed half\r\nthe day in his wretched bed, in which he frequently took his meals,\r\ndeclined shaving or changing his linen, and, when the sun shone into his\r\ncell, turned from it on his straw with a sigh of heart-broken\r\ndespondency. Formerly, when the air breathed through his grating, he\r\nused to say, \xe2\x80\x9cBlessed air of heaven, I shall breathe you once more in\r\nfreedom!--Reserve all your freshness for that delicious evening when I\r\nshall inhale you, and be as free as you myself.\xe2\x80\x9d Now when he felt it, he\r\nsighed and said nothing. The twitter of the sparrows, the pattering of\r\nrain, or the moan of the wind, sounds that he used to sit up in his bed\r\nto catch with delight, as reminding him of nature, were now unheeded.\r\n\r\nHe began at times to listen with sullen and horrible pleasure to the\r\ncries of his miserable companions. He became squalid, listless, torpid,\r\nand disgusting in his appearance. * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIt was one of those dismal nights, that, as he tossed on his loathsome\r\nbed,--more loathsome from the impossibility to quit it without feeling\r\nmore \xe2\x80\x9cunrest,\xe2\x80\x9d--he perceived the miserable light that burned in the\r\nhearth was obscured by the intervention of some dark object. He turned\r\nfeebly towards the light, without curiosity, without excitement, but\r\nwith a wish to diversify the monotony of his misery, by observing the\r\nslightest change made even accidentally in the dusky atmosphere of his\r\ncell. Between him and the light stood the figure of Melmoth, just as he\r\nhad seen him from the first; the figure was the same; the expression of\r\nthe face was the same,--cold, stony, and rigid; the eyes, with their\r\ninfernal and dazzling lustre, were still the same.\r\n\r\nStanton\xe2\x80\x99s ruling passion rushed on his soul; he felt this apparition\r\nlike a summons to a high and fearful encounter. He heard his heart beat\r\naudibly, and could have exclaimed with Lee\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate heroine,--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\npants as cowards do before a battle; Oh the great march has sounded!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelmoth approached him with that frightful calmness that mocks the\r\nterror it excites. \xe2\x80\x9cMy prophecy has been fulfilled;--you rise to meet me\r\nrattling from your chains, and rustling from your straw--am I not a true\r\nprophet?\xe2\x80\x9d Stanton was silent. \xe2\x80\x9cIs not your situation very\r\nmiserable?\xe2\x80\x9d--Still Stanton was silent; for he was beginning to believe\r\nthis an illusion of madness. He thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHow could he have\r\ngained entrance here?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cWould you not wish to be delivered from it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStanton tossed on his straw, and its rustling seemed to answer the\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cI have the power to deliver you from it.\xe2\x80\x9d Melmoth spoke very\r\nslowly and very softly, and the melodious smoothness of his voice made a\r\nfrightful contrast to the stony rigour of his features, and the\r\nfiend-like brilliancy of his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, and whence come you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Stanton, in a tone that was meant to be interrogatory and\r\nimperative, but which, from his habits of squalid debility, was at once\r\nfeeble and querulous. His intellects had become affected by the gloom of\r\nhis miserable habitation, as the wretched inmate of a similar mansion,\r\nwhen produced before a medical examiner, was reported to be a complete\r\nAlbinos.--\xe2\x80\x9cHis skin was bleached, his eyes turned white; he could not\r\nbear the light; and, when exposed to it, he turned away with a mixture\r\nof weakness and restlessness, more like the writhings of a sick infant\r\nthan the struggles of a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s situation; he was enfeebled now, and the power of the\r\nenemy seemed without a possibility of opposition from either his\r\nintellectual or corporeal powers. * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOf all their horrible dialogue, only these words were legible in the\r\nmanuscript, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know me now.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI always knew you.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cThat is false;\r\nyou imagined you did, and that has been the cause of all the wild * * *\r\n* * * * * * of the * * * * * of your finally being lodged in this\r\nmansion of misery, where only I would seek, where only I can succour\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou, demon!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cDemon!--Harsh words!--Was it a demon or a human\r\nbeing placed you here?--Listen to me, Stanton; nay, wrap not yourself in\r\nthat miserable blanket,--that cannot shut out my words. Believe me, were\r\nyou folded in thunder-clouds, you must hear _me_! Stanton, think of your\r\nmisery. These bare walls--what do they present to the intellect or to\r\nthe senses?--White-wash, diversified with the scrawls of charcoal or red\r\nchalk, that your happy predecessors have left for you to trace over. You\r\nhave a taste for drawing,--I trust it will improve. And here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngrating, through which the sun squints on you like a step-dame, and the\r\nbreeze blows, as if it meant to tantalize you with a sigh from that\r\nsweet mouth, whose kiss you must never enjoy. And where\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nlibrary,--intellectual man,--travelled man?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated in a tone of\r\nbitter derision; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere be your companions, your peaked men of\r\ncountries, as your favourite Shakespeare has it? You must be content\r\nwith the spider and the rat, to crawl and scratch round your flock-bed!\r\nI have known prisoners in the Bastile to feed them for companions,--why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you begin your task? I have known a spider to descend at the tap\r\nof a finger, and a rat to come forth when the daily meal was brought, to\r\nshare it with his fellow-prisoner!--How delightful to have vermin for\r\nyour guests! Aye, and when the feast fails them, they make a meal of\r\ntheir entertainer!--You shudder--Are you, then, the first prisoner who\r\nhas been devoured alive by the vermin that infested his\r\ncell?--Delightful banquet, not \xe2\x80\x9cwhere you eat, but where you are eaten!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nYour guests, however, will give you one token of repentance while they\r\nfeed; there will be _gnashing of teeth_, and you shall hear it, and feel\r\nit too perchance!--And then for meals--Oh you are daintily off!--The\r\nsoup that the cat has lapped; and (as her progeny has probably\r\ncontributed to the hell-broth) why not?---- Then your hours of solitude,\r\ndeliciously diversified by the yell of famine, the howl of madness, the\r\ncrash of whips, and the broken-hearted sob of those who, like you, are\r\nsupposed, or _driven_ mad by the crimes of others!--Stanton, do you\r\nimagine your reason can possibly hold out amid such scenes?--Supposing\r\nyour reason was unimpaired, your health not destroyed,--suppose all\r\nthis, which is, after all, more than fair supposition can grant, guess\r\nthe effect of the continuance of these scenes on your senses alone. A\r\ntime will come, and soon, when, from mere habit, you will echo the\r\nscream of every delirious wretch that harbours near you; then you will\r\npause, clasp your hands on your throbbing head, and listen with horrible\r\nanxiety whether the scream proceeded from _you_ or _them_. The time will\r\ncome, when, from the want of occupation, the listless and horrible\r\nvacancy of your hours, you will feel as anxious to hear those shrieks,\r\nas you were at first terrified to hear them,--when you will watch for\r\nthe ravings of your next neighbour, as you would for a scene on the\r\nstage. All humanity will be extinguished in you. The ravings of these\r\nwretches will become at once your sport and your torture. You will watch\r\nfor the sounds, to mock them with the grimaces and bellowings of a\r\nfiend. The mind has a power of accommodating itself to its situation,\r\nthat you will experience in its most frightful and deplorable efficacy.\r\nThen comes the dreadful doubt of one\xe2\x80\x99s own sanity, the terrible\r\nannouncer that _that_ doubt will soon become fear, and _that_ fear\r\ncertainty. Perhaps (still more dreadful) the _fear_ will at last become\r\na _hope_,--shut out from society, watched by a brutal keeper, writhing\r\nwith all the impotent agony of an incarcerated mind, without\r\ncommunication and without sympathy, unable to exchange ideas but with\r\nthose whose ideas are only the hideous spectres of departed intellect,\r\nor even to hear the welcome sound of the human voice, except to mistake\r\nit for the howl of a fiend, and stop the ear desecrated by its\r\nintrusion,--then at last your fear will become a more fearful hope; you\r\nwill wish to become one of them, to escape the agony of consciousness.\r\nAs those who have long leaned over a precipice, have at last felt a\r\ndesire to plunge below, to relieve the intolerable temptation of their\r\ngiddiness(11), you will hear them laugh amid their wildest paroxysms;\r\nyou will say, \xe2\x80\x98Doubtless those wretches have some consolation, but I\r\nhave none; my sanity is my greatest curse in this abode of horrors. They\r\ngreedily devour their miserable meals, while I loathe mine. They sleep\r\nsometimes soundly, while my sleep is--worse than their waking. They are\r\nrevived every morning by some delicious illusion of cunning madness,\r\nsoothing them with the hope of escaping, baffling or tormenting their\r\nkeeper; my sanity precludes all such hope. _I know I never can escape_,\r\nand the preservation of my faculties is only an aggravation of my\r\nsufferings. I have all their miseries,--I have none of their\r\nconsolations. They laugh,--I hear them; would I could laugh like them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYou will try, and the very effort will be an invocation to the demon of\r\ninsanity to come and take full possession of you from that moment for\r\never.\r\n\r\n  (11) A fact, related to me by a person who was near committing suicide\r\n  in a similar situation, to escape what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthe excruciating\r\n  torture of giddiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(There were other details, both of the menaces and temptations employed\r\nby Melmoth, which are too horrible for insertion. One of them may serve\r\nfor an instance).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think that the intellectual power is something distinct from the\r\nvitality of the soul, or, in other words, that if even your reason\r\nshould be destroyed, (which it nearly is), your soul might yet enjoy\r\nbeatitude in the full exercise of its enlarged and exalted faculties,\r\nand all the clouds which obscured them be dispelled by the Sun of\r\nRighteousness, in whose beams you hope to bask for ever and ever. Now,\r\nwithout going into any metaphysical subtleties about the distinction\r\nbetween mind and soul, experience must teach you, that there can be no\r\ncrime into which madmen would not, and do not precipitate themselves;\r\nmischief is their occupation, malice their habit, murder their sport,\r\nand blasphemy their delight. Whether a soul in this state can be in a\r\nhopeful one, it is for you to judge; but it seems to me, that with the\r\nloss of reason, (and reason cannot long be retained in this place), you\r\nlose also the hope of immortality.--Listen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tempter, pausing,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clisten to the wretch who is raving near you, and whose blasphemies\r\nmight make a demon start.--He was once an eminent puritanical preacher.\r\nHalf the day he imagines himself in a pulpit, denouncing damnation\r\nagainst Papists, Arminians, and even Sub-lapsarians, (he being a\r\nSupra-lapsarian himself). He foams, he writhes, he gnashes his teeth;\r\nyou would imagine him in the hell he was painting, and that the fire and\r\nbrimstone he is so lavish of, were actually exhaling from his jaws. At\r\nnight his _creed retaliates on him_; he believes himself one of the\r\nreprobates he has been all day denouncing, and curses God for the very\r\ndecree he has all day been glorifying Him for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, whom he has for twelve hours been vociferating \xe2\x80\x9cis the loveliest\r\namong ten thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d becomes the object of demoniac hostility and\r\nexecration. He grapples with the iron posts of his bed, and says he is\r\nrooting out the cross from the very foundations of Calvary; and it is\r\nremarkable, that in proportion as his morning exercises are intense,\r\nvivid, and eloquent, his nightly blasphemies are outrageous and\r\nhorrible.--Hark! Now he believes himself a demon; listen to his\r\ndiabolical eloquence of horror!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStanton listened, and shuddered * * * * * * \xe2\x80\x9cEscape--escape for your\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the tempter; \xe2\x80\x9cbreak forth into life, liberty, and sanity.\r\nYour social happiness, your intellectual powers, your immortal\r\ninterests, perhaps, depend on the choice of this moment.--There is the\r\ndoor, and the key is my hand. Choose--choose!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how comes the key\r\nin your hand? and what is the condition of my liberation?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stanton.\r\n* * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe explanation occupied several pages, which, to the torture of young\r\nMelmoth, were wholly illegible. It seemed, however, to have been\r\nrejected by Stanton with the utmost rage and horror, for Melmoth at last\r\nmade out,--\xe2\x80\x9cBegone, monster, demon!--begone to your native place. Even\r\nthis mansion of horror trembles to contain you; its walls sweat, and its\r\nfloors quiver, while you tread them.\xe2\x80\x9d * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this extraordinary manuscript was in such a state,\r\nthat, in fifteen mouldy and crumbling pages, Melmoth could hardly make\r\nout that number of lines. No antiquarian, unfolding with trembling hand\r\nthe calcined leaves of an Herculaneum manuscript, and hoping to discover\r\nsome lost lines of the \xc3\x86neis in Virgil\xe2\x80\x99s own autograph, or at least some\r\nunutterable abomination of Petronius or Martial, happily elucidatory of\r\nthe mysteries of the Spintri\xc3\xa6, or the orgies of the Phallic worshippers,\r\never pored with more luckless diligence, or shook a head of more\r\nhopeless despondency over his task. He could but just make out what\r\ntended rather to excite than assuage that feverish thirst of curiosity\r\nwhich was consuming his inmost soul. The manuscript told no more of\r\nMelmoth, but mentioned that Stanton was finally liberated from his\r\nconfinement,--that his pursuit of Melmoth was incessant and\r\nindefatigable,--that he himself allowed it to be a species of\r\ninsanity,--that while he acknowledged it to be the master-passion, he\r\nalso felt it the master-torment of his life. He again visited the\r\nContinent, returned to England,--pursued, inquired, traced, bribed, but\r\nin vain. The being whom he had met thrice, under circumstances so\r\nextraordinary, he was fated never to encounter again _in his life-time_.\r\nAt length, discovering that he had been born in Ireland, he resolved to\r\ngo there,--went, and found his pursuit again fruitless, and his\r\ninquiries unanswered. The family knew nothing of him, or at least what\r\nthey knew or imagined, they prudently refused to disclose to a stranger,\r\nand Stanton departed unsatisfied. It is remarkable, that he too, as\r\nappeared from many half-obliterated pages of the manuscript, never\r\ndisclosed to mortal the particulars of their conversation in the\r\nmad-house; and the slightest allusion to it threw him into fits of rage\r\nand gloom equally singular and alarming. He left the manuscript,\r\nhowever, in the hands of the family, possibly deeming, from their\r\nincuriosity, their apparent indifference to their relative, or their\r\nobvious inacquaintance with reading of any kind, manuscript or books,\r\nhis deposit would be safe. He seems, in fact, to have acted like men,\r\nwho, in distress at sea, intrust their letters and dispatches to a\r\nbottle sealed, and commit it to the waves. The last lines of the\r\nmanuscript that were legible, were sufficiently extraordinary. * * * * *\r\n*\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have sought him every where.--The desire of meeting him once more, is\r\nbecome as a burning fire within me,--it is the necessary condition of my\r\nexistence. I have vainly sought him at last in Ireland, of which I find\r\nhe is a native.--Perhaps our final meeting will be in * * * * * *\r\n\r\nSuch was the conclusion of the manuscript which Melmoth found in his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s closet. When he had finished it, he sunk down on the table near\r\nwhich he had been reading it, his face hid in his folded arms, his\r\nsenses reeling, his mind in a mingled state of stupor and excitement.\r\nAfter a few moments, he raised himself with an involuntary start, and\r\nsaw the picture gazing at him from its canvas. He was within ten inches\r\nof it as he sat, and the proximity appeared increased by the strong\r\nlight that was accidentally thrown on it, and its being the only\r\nrepresentation of a human figure in the room. Melmoth felt for a moment\r\nas if he were about to receive an explanation from its lips.\r\n\r\nHe gazed on it in return,--all was silent in the house,--they were alone\r\ntogether. The illusion subsided at length; and as the mind rapidly\r\npasses to opposite extremes, he remembered the injunction of his uncle\r\nto destroy the portrait. He seized it;--his hand shook at first, but the\r\nmouldering canvas appeared to assist him in the effort. He tore it from\r\nthe frame with a cry half terrific, half triumphant;--it fell at his\r\nfeet, and he shuddered as it fell. He expected to hear some fearful\r\nsounds, some unimaginable breathings of prophetic horror, follow this\r\nact of sacrilege, for such he felt it, to tear the portrait of his\r\nancestor from his native walls. He paused and listened:--\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no\r\nvoice, nor any that answered;\xe2\x80\x9d--but as the wrinkled and torn canvas fell\r\nto the floor, its undulations gave the portrait the appearance of\r\nsmiling. Melmoth felt horror indescribable at this transient and\r\nimaginary resuscitation of the figure. He caught it up, rushed into the\r\nnext room, tore, cut, and hacked it in every direction, and eagerly\r\nwatched the fragments that burned like tinder in the turf-fire which had\r\nbeen lit in his room. As Melmoth saw the last blaze, he threw himself\r\ninto bed, in hope of a deep and intense sleep. He had done what was\r\nrequired of him, and felt exhausted both in mind and body; but his\r\nslumber was not so sound as he had hoped for. The sullen light of the\r\nturf-fire, burning but never blazing, disturbed him every moment. He\r\nturned and turned, but still there was the same red light glaring on,\r\nbut not illuminating, the dusky furniture of the apartment. The wind was\r\nhigh that night, and as the creaking door swung on its hinges, every\r\nnoise seemed like the sound of a hand struggling with the lock, or of a\r\nfoot pausing on the threshold. But (for Melmoth never could decide) was\r\nit in a dream or not, that he saw the figure of his ancestor appear at\r\nthe door?--hesitatingly as he saw him at first on the night of his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s death,--saw him enter the room, approach his bed, and heard him\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have burned me, then; but those are flames I can\r\nsurvive.--I am alive,--I am beside you.\xe2\x80\x9d Melmoth started, sprung from\r\nhis bed,--it was broad day-light. He looked round,--there was no human\r\nbeing in the room but himself. He felt a slight pain in the wrist of his\r\nright arm. He looked at it, it was black and blue, as from the recent\r\ngripe of a strong hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    Haste with your weapons, cut the shrouds and stay,\r\n    And hew at once the mizen-mast away.\r\n\r\n    FALCONER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following evening Melmoth retired early. The restlessness of the\r\npreceding night inclined him to repose, and the gloom of the day left\r\nhim nothing to wish for but its speedy conclusion. It was now the latter\r\nend of Autumn; heavy clouds had all day been passing laggingly and\r\ngloomily along the atmosphere, as the hours of such a day pass over the\r\nhuman mind and life. Not a drop of rain fell; the clouds went\r\nportentously off, like ships of war after reconnoitering a strong fort,\r\nto return with added strength and fury. The threat was soon fulfilled;\r\nthe evening came on, prematurely darkened by clouds that seemed\r\nsurcharged with a deluge. Loud and sudden squalls of wind shook the\r\nhouse from time to time, and then as suddenly ceased. Towards night the\r\nstorm came on in all its strength; Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s bed was shaken so as to\r\nrender it impossible to sleep. He \xe2\x80\x9cliked the rocking of the\r\nbattlements,\xe2\x80\x9d but by no means liked the expected fall of the chimneys,\r\nthe crashing in of the roof, and the splinters of the broken windows\r\nthat were already scattered about his room. He rose and went down to the\r\nkitchen, where he knew a fire was burning, and there the terrified\r\nservants were all assembled, all agreeing, as the blast came roaring\r\ndown the chimney, they never had witnessed such a storm, and between the\r\ngusts, breathing shuddering prayers for those who were \xe2\x80\x9cout at sea that\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d The vicinity of Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s house to what sea-men call an\r\niron-bound coast, gave a dreadful sincerity to their prayers and their\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, however, Melmoth perceived that their minds were\r\noccupied with terrors beside those of the storm. The recent death of his\r\nuncle, and the supposed visit of that extraordinary being in whose\r\nexistence they all firmly believed, were connected in their minds\r\ninseparably with the causes or consequences of this tempest, and they\r\nwhispered their fearful suggestions to each other, till the sound\r\nreached Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s ears at every step that he measured across the broken\r\nfloor of the kitchen. Terror is very fond of associations; we love to\r\nconnect the agitation of the elements with the agitated life of man; and\r\nnever did a blast roar, or a gleam of lightning flash, that was not\r\nconnected in the imagination of some one, with a calamity that was to be\r\ndreaded, deprecated, or endured,--with the fate of the living, or the\r\ndestination of the dead. The tremendous storm that shook all England on\r\nthe night of Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s death, gave the hint to his puritanic chaplains\r\nto declare, that the Lord had caught him up in the whirlwind and chariot\r\nof fire, even thereafter, as he caught the prophet Elijah; while all the\r\ncavalier party, putting their own construction on the matter, proclaimed\r\ntheir confidence, that the Prince of the power of the air was\r\nvindicating his right, and carrying off the body of his victim (whose\r\nsoul had long been his purchase) in a tempest, whose wild howl and\r\ntriumphant ravage might have been variously, and with equal justice,\r\ninterpreted by each party as giving testimony to their mutual\r\ndenunciations. Just such a party (_mutatis mutandis_) were collected\r\nround the bickering fire and rocking chimney in Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis going in that blast,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the hags, taking the pipe from her\r\nmouth, and trying vainly to rekindle it among the embers that the storm\r\nscattered about like dust; \xe2\x80\x9che is going in that blast.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d cried another Sybil, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll come again,--he\xe2\x80\x99s not at rest!--He\r\nroams and wails about till something is told that he never could tell in\r\nhis life-time.--G-d save us!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, howling up the chimney, as if\r\naddressing the troubled spirit; \xe2\x80\x9ctell us what you want, and _stop the\r\nblast_, will ye?\xe2\x80\x9d--The wind came like thunder down the chimney; the hag\r\nshuddered and retreated. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s this you want--and this--and this,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried a young female whom Melmoth had not noticed before, \xe2\x80\x9ctake them;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand she eagerly tore the papers out of her hair, and flung them into the\r\nfire. Then Melmoth recollected a ridiculous story told him the day\r\nbefore of this girl, who had had the \xe2\x80\x9cbad luck,\xe2\x80\x9d as she called it, to\r\ncurl her hair with some of the old and useless law-papers of the family,\r\nand who now imagined that they \xe2\x80\x9cwho kept this dreadful pudder o\xe2\x80\x99er her\r\nhead,\xe2\x80\x9d were particularly provoked by her still retaining about her\r\nwhatever belonged to the deceased; and as she flung the fragments of\r\npaper into the fire, she cried aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cThere stop for the holy J----s\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsake, and let us have no more about it!--You have what you wanted, and\r\nwill you have done?\xe2\x80\x9d The laugh that Melmoth could hardly resist, was\r\nchecked by a sound which he heard distinctly amid the storm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush--silence! that was a signal gun!--there is a vessel in distress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey all paused and listened. We have already mentioned the closeness of\r\nMelmoth\xe2\x80\x99s abode to the sea-shore. This had well accustomed its inmates\r\nto all the terrors of shipwrecked vessels and drowning passengers. To\r\ntheir honour be it spoken, they never heard those sounds but as a claim,\r\na piteous, irresistible claim on their humanity. They knew nothing of\r\nthe barbarous practice on the English coast, of fastening a lanthorn to\r\nthe limbs of a spanselled horse, whose plungings were to misdirect the\r\nwrecked and sinking wretches, in the vain hope that the light they saw\r\nwas a beacon, and thus to double the horrors of death by the baffled\r\nexpectation of relief.\r\n\r\nThe party in the kitchen all watched Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s countenance intently, as\r\nif its expression could have told them \xe2\x80\x9cthe secrets of the hoary deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe storm ceased for a moment, and there was a deep and dreary silence\r\nof fearful expectation. The sound was heard again,--it could not be\r\nmistaken. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a gun,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Melmoth; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a vessel in distress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he hurried out of the kitchen, calling on the men to follow him.\r\n\r\nThe men partook eagerly of the excitement of enterprise and danger. A\r\nstorm without doors is, after all, better than a storm within; without\r\nwe have something to struggle with, within we have only to suffer; and\r\nthe severest storm, by exciting the energy of its victim, gives at once\r\na stimulus to action, and a solace to pride, which those must want who\r\nsit shuddering between rocking walls, and almost driven to wish they had\r\nonly to suffer, not to fear.\r\n\r\nWhile the men were in search of a hundred coats, boots, and hats of\r\ntheir old master, to be sought for in every part of the house,--while\r\none was dragging a great coat from the window, before which it had long\r\nhung as a blind, in total default of glass or shutters,--another was\r\nsnatching a wig from the jack, where it had been suspended for a\r\nduster,--and a third was battling with a cat and her brood of kittens\r\nfor a pair of old boots which she had been pleased to make the seat of\r\nher accouchement,--Melmoth had gone up to the highest room in the house.\r\nThe window was driven in;--had there been light, this window commanded a\r\nview of the sea and the coast. He leaned far out of it, and listened\r\nwith fearful and breathless anxiety. The night was dark, but far off,\r\nhis sight, sharpened by intense solicitude, descried a light at sea. The\r\ngust drove him from the window for a moment; at returning the next, he\r\nsaw a faint flash, and then the report of a gun followed.\r\n\r\nThere needed no more; and in a few moments after, Melmoth was on the\r\nshore. Their way was short, and they walked with their utmost speed; but\r\nthe violence of the storm made their progress very slow, and their\r\nanxiety made it seem still slower. From time to time they said to each\r\nother, in choaked and breathless accents, \xe2\x80\x9cCall up the people in those\r\ncabbins--there is a light in that house--they are all up--no wonder--who\r\ncould sleep in such a night--hold the lanthorn low--it is impossible to\r\nkeep footing on the strand.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnother gun!\xe2\x80\x9d they exclaimed, as the flash\r\nfaintly broke through the darkness, and the heavy sound rolled round the\r\nshore, as if fired over the grave of the sufferers. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the rock,\r\nhold fast, and cling together.\xe2\x80\x9d They scaled it. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nMelmoth, who was among the first, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a night! and what a\r\nspectacle!--Hold up your lanthorns--do you hear cries?--shout to\r\nthem--tell them there is help and hope near them.--Stay,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9clet\r\nme scramble up that crag--they will hear my voice from that.\xe2\x80\x9d He dashed\r\ndesperately through the water, while the foam of the breakers from a\r\ndistant rock almost choaked him, gained the point, and, elated by his\r\nsuccess, shouted aloud with his utmost strength. But his voice, baffled\r\nand drowned by the tempest, was lost even to his own hearing. Its sound\r\nwas faint and querulous, more like the wail of grief, than the\r\nencouraging cry of hope. At this moment, the racking clouds flying\r\nrapidly across the sky, like the scattered fugitives of a routed army,\r\nthe moon burst forth with the sudden and appalling effulgence of\r\nlightning. Melmoth caught a full view of the vessel, and of her danger.\r\nShe lay beating against a rock, over which the breakers dashed their\r\nfoam to the height of thirty feet. She was half in the water, a mere\r\nhulk, her rigging torn to shreds, her main mast cut away, and every sea\r\nshe shipped, Melmoth could hear distinctly the dying cries of those who\r\nwere swept away, or perhaps of those whose mind and body, alike\r\nexhausted, relaxed their benumbed hold of hope and life together,--knew\r\nthat the next shriek that was uttered must be their own and their last.\r\nThere is something so very horrible in the sight of human beings\r\nperishing so near us, that we feel one firm step rightly planted, one\r\narm steadily held out, might save at least one,--yet feel we know not\r\nwhere to fix that step, and cannot stretch that arm, that Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsenses reeled under the shock, and for a moment he echoed the storm with\r\nyells of actual insanity. By this time the country, having been alarmed\r\nby the news of a vessel going to pieces on the shore, had poured down in\r\nmultitudes; and those who, from experience or confidence, or even\r\nignorance, repeated incessantly, \xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible to save her,--every\r\nsoul on board must perish,\xe2\x80\x9d involuntarily quickened their steps as they\r\nuttered the words, as if they were anxious to behold the fulfilment of\r\ntheir own prediction, while they appeared hurrying to avert it.\r\n\r\nOf one man, in particular, it was observed, that during their hurried\r\nrush to the shore, he was, with what breath his haste allowed him,\r\nassuring the rest every moment, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would be down before they could get\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d and heard the ejaculations of \xe2\x80\x9cChrist save us! don\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, please God, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do some good,\xe2\x80\x9d with a laugh almost of triumph.\r\nWhen they arrived, this man scaled a rock at the risk of his life,\r\ncaught a view of the vessel, pointed out her desperate situation to\r\nthose below, and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you so? wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I right?\xe2\x80\x9d And as\r\nthe storm increased, his voice was still heard, \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t I right?\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nwhen the cries of the perishing crew were distinctly wafted to their\r\nears, he was still heard in the interval repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cBut wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d Singular sentiment of pride, that can erect its trophies amid\r\nthe grave. \xe2\x80\x99Tis in this spirit we give advice to those who suffer from\r\nlife, as well as from the elements; and when the heart of the victim\r\nbreaks, console ourselves by exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9c_Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I foretell it all?_\r\ndid I not tell you how it would be?\xe2\x80\x9d It is remarkable that this man lost\r\nhis life that very night in the most desperate and fruitless attempt to\r\nsave the life of one of the crew who was swimming within six yards of\r\nhim. The whole shore was now crowded with helpless gazers, every crag\r\nand cliff was manned; it seemed like a battle fought at once by sea and\r\nland, between hope and despair. No effectual assistance could be\r\nrendered,--not a boat could live in that gale,--yet still, and to the\r\nlast, cheers were heard from rock to rock,--terrible cheers, that\r\nannounced safety was near and--impossible;--lanthorns held aloft in all\r\ndirections, that displayed to the sufferers the shore all peopled with\r\nlife, and the roaring and impassable waves between;--ropes flung out,\r\nwith loud cries of help and encouragement, and caught at by some\r\nchilled, nerveless, and despairing hand, that only grasped the\r\nwave,--relaxed its hold,--was tossed once over the sinking head,--and\r\nthen seen no more. It was at this moment that Melmoth, starting from his\r\ntrance of terror, and looking round him, saw all, to the number of\r\nhundreds, anxious, restless, and occupied; and, though obviously in\r\nvain, the sight cheered his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much good there is in man,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it is called forth by the sufferings of his fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhad no leisure or inclination, then, to analyse the compound he called\r\ngood, and resolve it into its component parts of curiosity, strong\r\nexcitement, the pride of physical strength, or the comparative\r\nconsciousness of safety. He had, indeed, no leisure, for just then he\r\ndescried, standing a few yards above him on the rock, a figure that\r\nshewed neither sympathy or terror,--uttered no sound,--offered no help.\r\nMelmoth could hardly keep his footing on the slippery and rocking crag\r\non which he stood; the figure, who stood still higher, appeared alike\r\nunmoved by the storm, as by the spectacle. Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s surtout, in spite\r\nof his efforts to wrap it round him, was fluttering in rags,--not a\r\nthread of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s garments seemed ruffled by the blast. But this\r\ndid not strike him so much as his obvious insensibility to the distress\r\nand terror around him, and he exclaimed aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cGood God! is it possible\r\nthat any thing bearing the human form should stand there without making\r\nan effort, without expressing a feeling, for those perishing wretches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nA pause ensued, or the blast carried away the sound; but a few moments\r\nafter, Melmoth distinctly heard the words, \xe2\x80\x9cLet them perish.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked\r\nup, the figure still stood unmoved, the arms folded across the breast,\r\nthe foot advanced, and fixed as in defiance of the white and climbing\r\nspray of the wave, and the stern profile caught in the glimpses of the\r\nstormy and doubtful moon-light, seeming to watch the scene with an\r\nexpression formidable, revolting, and unnatural. At this moment, a\r\ntremendous wave breaking over the deck of the hulk, extorted a cry of\r\nhorror from the spectators; they felt as if they were echoing that of\r\nthe victims whose corses were in a few moments to be dashed against\r\ntheir feet, mangled and lifeless.\r\n\r\nWhen the cry had ceased, Melmoth heard a laugh that chilled his blood.\r\nIt was from the figure that stood above him. Like lightning then glanced\r\non his memory the recollection of that night in Spain, when Stanton\r\nfirst encountered that extraordinary being, whose charmed life, \xe2\x80\x9cdefying\r\nspace and time,\xe2\x80\x9d held such fatal influence over his, and when he first\r\nrecognised his supposed demoniac character by the laugh with which he\r\nhailed the spectacle of the blasted lovers. The echo of that laugh rung\r\nin Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s ears; he believed it was indeed that mysterious being who\r\nwas standing so near him. His mind, by its late intense and bewildering\r\npursuits, at once heated and darkened, like the atmosphere under an\r\nincumbent thunder-cloud, had now no power of inquiry, of conjecture, or\r\nof calculation. He instantly began to climb the rock,--the figure was\r\nbut a few feet above him,--the object of his daily and nightly dreams\r\nwas at last within the reach of his mind and his arm,--was almost\r\ntangible. _Fang_ and _Snare_(12) themselves, in all the enthusiasm of\r\nprofessional zeal, never uttered, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I but once get him within my\r\nvice,\xe2\x80\x9d with more eagerness than did Melmoth, as he scrambled up his\r\nsteep and perilous path, to the ledge of the rock where the figure stood\r\nso calm and dark. Panting from the fury of the storm, the vehemence of\r\nhis own exertions, and the difficulty of the task, he was now almost\r\nfoot to foot, and face to face, with the object of his pursuit, when,\r\ngrasping at the loosened fragment of a stone whose fall could not have\r\nhurt a child, though on its tottering insecurity hung the life-grasp of\r\na man, his hold failed--he fell backwards,--the roaring deep was\r\nbeneath, seeming to toss its ten thousand arms to receive and devour\r\nhim. He did not feel the instantaneous giddiness of his fall, but as he\r\nsunk he felt the splash, he heard the roar. He was engulphed, then for a\r\nmoment thrown to the surface. He struggled with nothing to grasp at. He\r\nsunk with a vague thought, that if he could reach the bottom, if he\r\ncould arrive at any thing solid, he was safe. Ten thousand trumpets then\r\nseemed to ring in his ears; lights flashed from his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed to\r\ngo through fire and water,\xe2\x80\x9d and remembered no more till several days\r\nafterwards, when he found himself in bed, the old gouvernante beside\r\nhim, and uttered faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a horrid dream!\xe2\x80\x9d then sinking back as he\r\nfelt his exhaustion, \xe2\x80\x9cand how weak it has left me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  (12) See Henry IV. Second Part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, \xe2\x80\x9cthat from hell there is no\r\n    _retention_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n    CERVANTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some hours after this exclamation, Melmoth lay silent, his memory\r\nreturning,--his senses gradually defecated,--the intellectual lord\r\nslowly returning to his abdicated throne.--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember all now,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, starting up in his bed with a sudden\r\nvehemence, that terrified his old nurse with the apprehension of\r\nreturning insanity; but when she approached the bed, candle in hand,\r\ncautiously veiling her eyes with the other, while she threw the full\r\nglare of the light on the face of the patient, she saw in a moment the\r\nlight of sanity in his eyes, and the strength of health in his\r\nmovements. To his eager inquiries of how he had been saved, how the\r\nstorm had terminated, and whether any but himself had survived the\r\nwreck, she could not deny herself the gratification of answering, though\r\nconscious of his weakness, and solemnly charged neither to let him speak\r\nor hear, as she valued the recovery of his reason. She had faithfully\r\nobserved the charge for several days,--a dreadful trial!--and now she\r\nfelt like Fatima in Cymon, who, when threatened by the magician with the\r\nloss of speech, exclaims, \xe2\x80\x9cBarbarian, will not my death then satisfy\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began her narrative, the effect of which was, to lull Melmoth into a\r\nprofound repose before half of it was concluded; he felt the full\r\nbenefit of the invalids mentioned in Spenser, who used to hire Irish\r\nstory-tellers, and found those indefatigable persons still pursuing the\r\ntale when they awoke. At first Melmoth listened with eager attention;\r\nsoon he was in the situation of him described by Miss Baillie,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWho, half asleep, but faintly hears,\r\n     The gossip\xe2\x80\x99s tale hum in his ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon after his lengthened respiration gave token that she was only\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cvexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;\xe2\x80\x9d while, as she closed the curtain,\r\nand shaded the light, the images of her story were faintly painted on\r\nhis dream, that still seemed half a waking one.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Melmoth sat up, gazed round, remembered every thing in a\r\nmoment, though nothing distinctly, but felt the most intense anxiety to\r\nsee the stranger saved from the shipwreck, who, he remembered the\r\ngouvernante had told him, (while her words seemed to falter on the\r\nthreshold of his closing senses), was still alive, and an inmate in his\r\nhouse, but weak and ill from the bruises he had received, and the\r\nexhaustion and terror he had undergone. The opinions of the household on\r\nthe subject of this stranger were various. The knowledge of his being a\r\nCatholic had conciliated their hearts, for the first act of his\r\nrecovered reason was to request that a Catholic priest might be sent\r\nfor, and the first use of his speech was to express his satisfaction\r\nthat he was in a country where he might enjoy the benefits of the rites\r\nof his own church. So far all was well; but there was a mysterious\r\nhaughtiness and reserve about him, that somewhat repelled the officious\r\ncuriosity of his attendants. He spoke often to himself in a language\r\nthey did not understand; they hoped relief from the priest on this\r\npoint, but the priest, after listening long at the invalid\xe2\x80\x99s door,\r\npronounced the language in which he was soliloquizing _not to be Latin_,\r\nand, after a conversation of some hours with him, refused to tell what\r\nlanguage the stranger spoke to himself in, and forbid all inquiry on the\r\nsubject. This was bad enough; but, still worse, the stranger spoke\r\nEnglish with ease and fluency, and therefore could have no right, as all\r\nthe household argued, to torment them with those unknown sounds, that,\r\nsonorous and powerful as they were, seemed to their ears like an\r\nevocation of some invisible being.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asks for what he wants in English,\xe2\x80\x9d said the harassed housekeeper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand he can call for candle in English, and he can say he\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed\r\nin English; and why the devil can\xe2\x80\x99t he do every thing in English?--He\r\ncan say his prayers too in English to that picture he\xe2\x80\x99s always pulling\r\nout of his breast and talking to, though it\xe2\x80\x99s no saint, I am sure, he\r\nprays to, (from the glimpse I got of it), but more like the\r\ndevil,--Christ save us!\xe2\x80\x9d All these strange rumours, and ten thousand\r\nmore, were poured into Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s ears, fast and faster than he could\r\nreceive them. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Father Fay in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at last,\r\nunderstanding that the priest visited the stranger every day; \xe2\x80\x9cif he be,\r\nlet me see him.\xe2\x80\x9d Father Fay attended him as soon as he quitted the\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\r\n\r\nHe was a grave and decent priest, well \xe2\x80\x9cspoken of by those that were\r\nwithout\xe2\x80\x9d the pale of his own communion; and as he entered the room,\r\nMelmoth smiled at the idle tattle of his domestics. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you for\r\nyour attention to this unfortunate gentleman, who, I understand, is in\r\nmy house.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI am told he sometimes speaks in a\r\nforeign tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d The priest assented. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what countryman he\r\nis?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Spaniard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the priest. This plain, direct answer, had\r\nthe proper effect on Melmoth, of convincing him of its veracity, and of\r\nthere being no mystery in the business, but what the folly of his\r\nservants had made.\r\n\r\nThe priest proceeded to tell him the particulars of the loss of the\r\nvessel. She was an English trader bound for Wexford or Waterford, with\r\nmany passengers on board; she had been driven up the Wicklow coast by\r\nstress of weather, had struck on the night of the 19th October, during\r\nthe intense darkness that accompanied the storm, on a hidden reef of\r\nrocks, and gone to pieces. Crew, passengers, all had perished, except\r\nthis Spaniard. It was singular, too, that this man had saved the life of\r\nMelmoth. While swimming for his own, he had seen him fall from the rock\r\nhe was climbing, and, though his strength was almost exhausted, had\r\ncollected its last remains to preserve the life of a being who, as he\r\nconceived, had been betrayed into danger by his humanity. His efforts\r\nwere successful, though Melmoth was unconscious of them; and in the\r\nmorning they were found on the strand, locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s hold, but\r\nstiff and senseless. They shewed some signs of life when an attempt was\r\nmade to remove them, and the stranger was conveyed to Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou owe your life to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the priest, when he had ended. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\ngo and thank him for it this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melmoth; but as he was\r\nassisted to rise, the old woman whispered to him with visible terror,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJasus\xe2\x80\x99 sake, dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him ye\xe2\x80\x99re a Melmoth, for the dear life!\r\nHe has been as mad as any thing out of Bedlam, since some jist mintioned\r\nthe name before him the ither night.\xe2\x80\x9d A sickening recollection of some\r\nparts of the manuscript came over Melmoth at these words, but he\r\nstruggled with himself, and proceeded to the apartment of the stranger.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard was a man about thirty, of a noble form and prepossessing\r\nmanners. To the gravity of his nation was superadded a deeper tint of\r\npeculiar melancholy. He spoke English fluently; and when questioned on\r\nit by Melmoth, he remarked with a sigh, that he had learnt it in a\r\npainful school. Melmoth then changed the subject, to thank him with\r\nearnest gratitude for the preservation of his life. \xe2\x80\x9cSenhor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSpaniard, \xe2\x80\x9cspare me; if your life was no dearer to you than mine, it\r\nwould not be worth thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYet you made the most strenuous exertions\r\nto save it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melmoth. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was instinct,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Spaniard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou also struggled to save mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melmoth. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was instinct too\r\nat the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Spaniard; then resuming his stately politeness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor I should say, the influence of my better genius. I am wholly a\r\nstranger in this country, and must have fared miserably but for the\r\nshelter of your roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelmoth observed that he spoke with evident pain, and he confessed a few\r\nmoments afterwards, that though he had escaped without any serious\r\ninjury, he had been so bruised and lacerated, that he still breathed\r\nwith difficulty, and hardly possessed the use of his limbs. As he\r\nconcluded the account of his sufferings during the storm, the wreck, and\r\nthe subsequent struggle for life, he exclaimed in Spanish, \xe2\x80\x9cGod! why did\r\nthe Jonah survive, and the mariners perish?\xe2\x80\x9d Melmoth, imagining he was\r\nengaged in some devotional ejaculation, was going to retire, when the\r\nSpaniard detained him. \xe2\x80\x9cSenhor, I understand your name is----\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npaused, shuddered, and with an effort that seemed like convulsion,\r\ndisgorged the name of Melmoth. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Melmoth.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHad you an\r\nancestor, a very remote one, who was--at a period perhaps beyond\r\nfamily-tradition----It is useless to inquire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Spaniard,\r\ncovering his face with both his hands, and groaning aloud. Melmoth\r\nlistened in mingled excitement and terror. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, if you would\r\nproceed, I could answer you--go on, Senhor.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHad you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSpaniard, forcing himself to speak, abruptly and rapidly, \xe2\x80\x9chad you,\r\nthen, a relative who was, about one hundred and forty years ago, said to\r\nbe in Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI believe--yes, I fear--I had.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough,\r\nSenhor--leave me--to-morrow perhaps--leave me now.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to\r\nleave you now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melmoth, catching him in his arms before he sunk on\r\nthe floor. He was not senseless, for his eyes were rolling with terrible\r\nexpression, and he attempted to articulate. They were alone. Melmoth,\r\nunable to quit him, called aloud for water; and while attempting to open\r\nhis vest, and give him air, his hand encountered a miniature portrait\r\nclose to the heart of the stranger. As he touched it, his touch operated\r\non the patient with all the force of the most powerful restorative. He\r\ngrasped it with his own cold hand with a force like that of death, and\r\nmuttered in a hollow but thrilling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d He felt\r\neagerly the ribbon by which it was suspended, and, satisfied that his\r\nterrible treasure was safe, turned his eyes with a fearful calmness of\r\nexpression on Melmoth, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know all, then?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMelmoth faultering. The Spaniard rose from the ground, to which he had\r\nalmost fallen, disengaged himself from the arms that supported him, and\r\neagerly, but staggeringly, hurrying towards the candles, (it was night),\r\nheld up the portrait full before Melmoth\xe2\x80\x99s eye. It was a miniature\r\nlikeness of that extraordinary being. It was painted in a coarse and\r\nunartist-like style, but so faithfully, that the pencil appeared rather\r\nheld by the mind than by the fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he--was the original of this--your ancestor?--Are you his\r\ndescendant?--Are you the depository of that terrible secret which----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe again fell to the ground convulsed, and Melmoth, for whose\r\ndebilitated state this scene was too much, was removed to his own\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nIt was several days before he again saw his visitor; his manner was then\r\ncalm and collected, till he appeared to recollect the necessity of\r\nmaking an apology for his agitation at their last meeting. He\r\nbegan--hesitated--stopped; tried in vain to arrange his ideas, or rather\r\nhis language; but the effort so obviously renewed his agitation, that\r\nMelmoth felt an exertion on his part necessary to avert its\r\nconsequences, and began most inauspiciously to inquire into the motive\r\nof his voyage to Ireland. After a long pause, the Spaniard said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nmotive, Senhor, a few days past I believed it was not in mortal power to\r\ncompel me to disclose. I deemed it incommunicable as it was incredible.\r\nI conceived myself to be alone on the earth, without sympathy and beyond\r\nrelief. It is singular that accident should have placed me within the\r\nreach of the only being from whom I could expect either, and perhaps a\r\ndevelopement of those circumstances which have placed me in a situation\r\nso extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d This exordium, delivered with a composed but\r\nthrilling gravity, had an effect on Melmoth. He sat down and prepared to\r\nlisten, and the Spaniard began to speak; but after some hesitation, he\r\nsnatched the picture from his neck, and trampling on it with true\r\ncontinental action, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cDevil! devil! thou choakest me!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ncrushing the portrait, glass and all, under his feet, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\r\nam easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room in which they sat was a low, mean, wretchedly furnished\r\napartment; the evening was tempestuous, and as the windows and doors\r\nrattled in the blast, Melmoth felt as if he listened to some herald of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfate and fear.\xe2\x80\x9d A deep and sickening agitation shook his frame; and in\r\nthe long pause that preceded the narrative of the Spaniard, the beating\r\nof his heart was audible to him. He rose, and attempted to arrest the\r\nnarration by a motion of his hand; but the Spaniard mistook this for the\r\nanxiety of his impatience, and commenced his narrative, which, in mercy\r\nto the reader, we shall give without the endless interruptions, and\r\nqueries, and anticipations of curiosity, and starts of terror, with\r\nwhich it was broken by Melmoth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTale of the Spaniard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, Senhor, as you know, a native of Spain, but you are yet to learn\r\nI am a descendant of one of its noblest houses,--a house of which she\r\nmight have been proud in her proudest day,--the house of Mon\xc3\xa7ada. Of\r\nthis I was not myself conscious during the first years of my life; but\r\nduring those years, I remember experiencing the singular contrast of\r\nbeing treated with the utmost tenderness, and kept in the most sordid\r\nprivacy. I lived in a wretched house in the suburbs of Madrid with an\r\nold woman, whose affection for me appeared prompted as much by interest\r\nas inclination. I was visited every week by a young cavalier and a\r\nbeautiful female; they caressed me, called me their beloved child, and\r\nI, attached by the grace with which my young father\xe2\x80\x99s _capa_ was folded,\r\nand my mother\xe2\x80\x99s veil adjusted, and by a certain air of indescribable\r\nsuperiority over those by whom I was surrounded, eagerly returned their\r\ncaresses, and petitioned them to take me _home_ with them; at these\r\nwords they always wept, gave a valuable present to the woman I lived\r\nwith, whose attention was always redoubled by this expected stimulant,\r\nand departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI observed their visits were always short, and paid late in the\r\nevening; thus a shadow of mystery enveloped my infant days, and perhaps\r\ngave its lasting and ineffaceable tinge to the pursuits, the character,\r\nand the feelings of my present existence. A sudden change took\r\nplace;--one day I was visited, splendidly dressed, and carried in a\r\nsuperb vehicle, whose motion made me giddy with novelty and surprise, to\r\na palace whose front appeared to me to reach the heavens. I was hurried\r\nthrough several apartments, whose splendour made my eyes ache, amid an\r\narmy of bowing domestics, to a cabinet where sat an old nobleman, whom,\r\nfrom the tranquil majesty of his posture, and the silent magnificence\r\nthat surrounded him, I felt disposed to fall down and worship as we do\r\nthose saints, whom, after traversing the aisles of an immense church, we\r\nfind niched in some remote and solitary shrine. My father and mother\r\nwere there, and both seemed awed by the presence of that aged vision,\r\npale and august; their awe increased mine, and as they led me to his\r\nfeet, I felt as if about to be sacrificed. He embraced me, however, with\r\nsome reluctance and more austerity; and when this ceremony was\r\nperformed, during which I trembled, I was removed by a domestic, and\r\nconducted to an apartment where I was treated like the son of a grandee;\r\nin the evening I was visited by my father and mother; they shed tears\r\nover me as they embraced me, but I thought I could perceive they mingled\r\nthe tears of grief with those of fondness. Every thing around appeared\r\nso strange, that perhaps I felt something appropriate in this change. I\r\nwas so much altered myself, that I expected an alteration in others, and\r\nthe reverse would have struck me as a phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange followed change with such rapidity, that it produced on me an\r\neffect like that of intoxication. I was now twelve years old, and the\r\ncontracted habits of my early life had had their usual effect, of\r\nexalting my imagination, while they impaired every other faculty. I\r\nexpected an adventure whenever the door opened, and that was but seldom,\r\nto announce the hours of devotion, food, and exercise. On the third day\r\nafter I was received into the palace of Mon\xc3\xa7ada, the door was opened at\r\nan unusual hour, (a circumstance that made me tremble with\r\nanticipation), and my father and mother, attended by a number of\r\ndomestics, entered, accompanied by a youth whose superior height and\r\nalready distinguished figure, made him appear my senior, though he was\r\nin fact a year younger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlonzo,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father to me, \xe2\x80\x9cembrace your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d I advanced with\r\nall the eagerness of youthful affection, that feels delight from new\r\nclaims on its store, and half wishes those new claims were endless; but\r\nthe slow step of my brother, the measured air with which he extended his\r\narms, and declined his head on my left shoulder for a moment, and then\r\nraising it, viewed me with eyes in whose piercing and haughty lustre\r\nthere was not one beam of fraternity, repelled and disconcerted me. We\r\nhad obeyed our father, however, and embraced. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see you hand in\r\nhand together,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father, as if he would have enjoyed the sight. I\r\nheld out my hand to my brother, and we stood thus linked for a few\r\nmoments, my father and mother remaining at some distance to gaze on us;\r\nduring these _few_ moments, I had leisure to glance from my parents to\r\nmy brother, and judge of the comparative effect our appearance thus\r\ncontrasted might produce on them. The contrast was by no means\r\nfavourable to me. I was tall, but my brother was much taller; he had an\r\nair of confidence, of conquest I might say; the brilliancy of his\r\ncomplexion could be equalled only by that of his dark eyes, which turned\r\nfrom me to our parents, and seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cChuse between us, and reject\r\nme if you dare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father and mother advanced and embraced us both. I clung round their\r\nnecks; my brother submitted to their caresses with a kind of proud\r\nimpatience, that seemed to demand a more marked recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw no more of them,--that evening the whole household, which perhaps\r\ncontain two hundred domestics, were in despair. The Duke de Mon\xc3\xa7ada,\r\nthat awful vision of anticipated mortality whom I had seen but once, was\r\ndead. The tapestry was torn from the walls; every room was filled with\r\necclesiastics; I was neglected by my attendants, and wandered through\r\nthe spacious rooms, till I by chance lifted up a curtain of black\r\nvelvet, and saw a sight which, young as I was, paralyzed me. My father\r\nand mother, dressed in black, sat beside a figure which I believed to be\r\nmy grandfather asleep, but his sleep was very profound; my brother was\r\nthere too, in a mourning dress, but its strange and grotesque\r\ndisfigurement could not conceal the impatience with which he wore it,\r\nand the flashing eagerness of his expression, and the haughty brilliancy\r\nof his eye, shewed a kind of impatience of the part he was compelled to\r\nact.--I rushed forward;--I was withheld by the domestics;--I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nam I not permitted to be here, where my younger brother is?\xe2\x80\x9d An\r\necclesiastic drew me from the apartment. I struggled with him, and\r\ndemanded, with an arrogance which suited my pretensions better than my\r\nprospects, \xe2\x80\x9cWho I was?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe grandson of the late Duke of Mon\xc3\xa7ada,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why am I thus treated?\xe2\x80\x9d To this no answer. I was\r\nconveyed to my apartment, and closely watched during the interment of\r\nthe Duke of Mon\xc3\xa7ada. I was not permitted to attend his funeral. I saw\r\nthe splendid and melancholy cavalcade depart from the palace. I ran from\r\nwindow to window to witness the funeral pomp, but was not allowed to\r\naccompany it. Two days after I was told a carriage waited for me at the\r\ngate. I entered it, and was conveyed to a convent of Ex-Jesuits, (as\r\nthey were well known to be, though no one in Madrid dared to say so),\r\nwhere an agreement had been made for my board and education, and where I\r\nbecame an inmate that very day. I applied myself to my studies, my\r\nteachers were pleased, my parents visited me frequently, and gave the\r\nusual marks of affection, and all was well; till one day as they were\r\nretiring, I heard an old domestic in their suite remark, how singular it\r\nwas, that the eldest son of the (now) Duke de Mon\xc3\xa7ada should be educated\r\nin a convent, and brought up to a monastic life, while the younger,\r\nliving in a superb palace, was surrounded by teachers suited to his\r\nrank. The word \xe2\x80\x9cmonastic life\xe2\x80\x9d thrilled in my ears; it furnished me with\r\nan interpretation not only of the indulgence I had experienced in the\r\nconvent, (an indulgence quite inconsistent with the usual severity of\r\ntheir discipline), but of the peculiar language in which I had been\r\nalways addressed by the Superior, the brethren, and the boarders. The\r\nformer, whom I saw once a week, bestowed the most flattering praises on\r\nthe progress I had made in my studies, (praises that covered me with\r\nblushes, for I well knew it was very moderate compared with that of the\r\nother boarders), and then gave me his benediction, but never without\r\nadding, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! thou wilt not suffer this lamb to wander from thy\r\nfold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe brethren always assumed before me an air of tranquillity, that\r\neulogized their situation more powerfully than the most exaggerated\r\neloquence. The petty squabbles and intrigues of the convent, the bitter\r\nand incessant conflict of habits, tempers, and interests, the efforts of\r\nincarcerated minds for objects of excitement, the struggles to diversify\r\nendless monotony, and elevate hopeless mediocrity;--all that makes\r\nmonastic life like the wrong side of tapestry, where we see only uncouth\r\nthreads, and the harsh outlines, without the glow of the colours, the\r\nrichness of the tissue, or the splendour of the embroidery, that renders\r\nthe external surface so rich and dazzling; all this was carefully\r\nconcealed. I heard something of it, however, and, young as I was, could\r\nnot help wondering how men who carried the worst passions of life into\r\ntheir retreat, could imagine _that_ retreat was a refuge from the\r\nerosions of their evil tempers, the monitions of conscience, and the\r\naccusations of God. The same dissimulation was practised by the\r\nboarders; the whole house was in masquerade from the moment I entered\r\nit. If I joined the latter at the time of recreation, they went through\r\nthe few amusements allowed them with a kind of languid impatience, as if\r\nit was an interruption of better pursuits to which they were devoted.\r\nOne of them, coming up to me, would say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity that these\r\nexercises are necessary for the support of our frail nature! what a pity\r\nwe cannot devote its whole powers to the service of God!\xe2\x80\x9d Another would\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cI never am so happy as in the choir! What a delightful eulogy was\r\nthat pronounced by the Superior on the departed Fre Jose! How thrilling\r\nwas that requiem! I imagined the heavens opened, and angels descending\r\nto receive his soul, as I listened to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this, and much more, I had been accustomed to hear every day. I now\r\nbegan to understand it. I suppose they thought they had a very weak\r\nperson to deal with; but the bare-faced coarseness of their man\xc5\x93uvres\r\nonly quickened my penetration, which began to be fearfully awake. I said\r\nto them, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you, then, intended for the monastic life?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I have heard you, Oliva, _once_ (it was when you did not think I\r\noverheard you) I heard you complain of the length and tediousness of the\r\nhomilies delivered on the eves of the saints.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI was then under the\r\ninfluence of the evil spirit doubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliva, who was a boy not\r\nolder than myself; \xe2\x80\x9cSatan is sometimes permitted to buffet those whose\r\nvocation is but commencing, and whom he is therefore more afraid to\r\nlose.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have heard you, Balcastro, say you had not taste for\r\nmusic; and to me, I confess, that of the choir appears least likely to\r\ninspire a taste for it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGod has touched my heart since,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nyoung hypocrite, crossing himself; \xe2\x80\x9cand you know, friend of my soul,\r\nthere is a promise, that the ears of the deaf shall be opened.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nare those words?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bible?--But we are not permitted\r\nto read it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTrue, dear Mon\xc3\xa7ada, but we have the word of our Superior\r\nand the brethren for it, and that is enough.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; our spiritual\r\nguides must take on themselves the whole responsibility of that state,\r\nwhose enjoyments and punishments they reserve in their own hands; but,\r\nBalcastro, are you willing to take this life on their word, as well as\r\nthe next, and resign it before you have tried it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, you\r\nonly speak to tempt me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_I do not speak to tempt_,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, and was\r\nturning indignantly away, when the bell ringing, produced its usual\r\neffect on us all. My companions assumed a more sanctified air, and I\r\nstruggled for a more composed one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we went to the church, they conversed in whispers, but those\r\nwhispers were intended to reach my ear. I could hear them say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is in\r\nvain that he struggles with grace; there never was a more decided\r\nvocation; God never obtained a more glorious victory. Already he has the\r\nlook of a child of heaven;--the monastic gait,--the downcast look;--the\r\nmotion of his arms naturally imitates the sign of the cross, and the\r\nvery folds of his mantle arrange themselves, by a divine instinct, into\r\nthose of a Monk\xe2\x80\x99s habit.\xe2\x80\x9d And all this while my gait was disturbed, my\r\ncountenance flushed, and often lifted to heaven, and my arms employed in\r\nhastily adjusting my cloak, that had fallen off my shoulder from my\r\nagitation, and whose disordered folds resembled any thing but those of a\r\nMonk\xe2\x80\x99s habit. From that evening I began to perceive my danger, and to\r\nmeditate how to avert it. I had no inclination for the monastic life;\r\nbut after vespers, and the evening exercise in my own cell, I began to\r\ndoubt if this very repugnance was not itself a sin. Silence and night\r\ndeepened the impression, and I lay awake for many hours, supplicating\r\nGod to enlighten me, to enable me not to oppose his will, but clearly to\r\nreveal that will to me; and if he was not pleased to call me to a\r\nmonastic life, to support my resolution in undergoing every thing that\r\nmight be inflicted on me, sooner than profane that state by extorted\r\nvows and an alienated mind. That my prayers might be more effectual, I\r\noffered them up first in the name of the Virgin, then in that of the\r\nPatron-saint of the family, and then of the Saint on whose eve I was\r\nborn. I lay in great agitation till morning, and went to matins without\r\nhaving closed my eyes, I had, however, I felt, acquired\r\n_resolution_,--at least I thought so. Alas! I knew not what I had to\r\nencounter. I was like a man going to sea with a day\xe2\x80\x99s provision, and\r\nimagining he is victualled for a voyage to the poles. I went through my\r\nexercises (as they were called) with uncommon assiduity that day;\r\nalready I felt the necessity of imposition,--fatal lesson of monastic\r\ninstitutions. We dined at noon; and soon after my father\xe2\x80\x99s carriage\r\narrived, and I was permitted to go for an hour on the banks of the\r\nManzanares. To my surprise my father was in the carriage, and though he\r\nwelcomed me with a kind of embarrassment, I was delighted to meet him.\r\nHe was a layman at least,--_he might have a heart_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was disappointed at the measured phrase he addressed me in, and this\r\nfroze me at once into a rigid determination, to be as much _on my guard\r\nwith him_, as I must be within the walls of the convent. The\r\nconversation began, \xe2\x80\x9cYou like your convent, my son?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d (there\r\nwas not a word of truth in my answer, but the fear of circumvention\r\nalways teaches falsehood, and we have only to thank our instructors).\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Superior is very fond of you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe seems so.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe brethren are\r\nattentive to your studies, and capable of directing them, and\r\nappreciating your progress.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey seem so.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the boarders--they are\r\nsons of the first families in Spain, they appear all satisfied with\r\ntheir situation, and eager to embrace its advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey seem so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear son, why have you thrice answered me in the same monotonous,\r\nunmeaning phrase?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I thought it all _seeming_.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow, then,\r\nwould you say that the devotion of those holy men, and the profound\r\nattention of their pupils, whose studies are alike beneficial to man,\r\nand redounding to the glory of the church to which they are dedicated--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest father,--I say nothing of them,--but _I dare_ to speak of\r\nmyself,--I can never be a monk,--if that is your object--spurn\r\nme,--order your lacqueys to drag me from this carriage,--leave me a\r\nbeggar in the streets to cry (13)\xe2\x80\x9c_fire and water_,\xe2\x80\x9d--but do not make me\r\na monk.\xe2\x80\x9d My father appeared stunned by this apostrophe. He did not utter\r\na word. He had not expected such a premature developement of the secret\r\nwhich he imagined _he_ had to disclose, not to hear disclosed. At this\r\nmoment the carriage turned into the _Prado_; a thousand magnificent\r\nequipages, with plumed horses, superb caparisons, and beautiful women\r\nbowing to the cavaliers, who stood for a moment on the foot-board, and\r\nthen bowed their adieus to the \xe2\x80\x9cladies of their love,\xe2\x80\x9d passed before our\r\neyes. I saw my father, at this moment, arrange his superb mantle, and\r\nthe silk net in which his long black hair was bound, and give the signal\r\nto his lacqueys to stop, that he might mingle among the crowd. I caught\r\nthis moment,--I grasped his mantle.--\xe2\x80\x9cFather, you find this world\r\ndelightful then,--would you ask me to resign it,--me,--who am your\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are too young for it, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, then, my father, I\r\nam surely much _too young for another world_, to which you would force\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cForce you, my child, my first-born!\xe2\x80\x9d And these words he uttered\r\nwith such tenderness, that I involuntarily kissed his hands, while his\r\nlips eagerly pressed my forehead. It was at this moment that I studied,\r\nwith all the eagerness of hope, my father\xe2\x80\x99s physiognomy, or what artists\r\nwould call his _physique_.\r\n\r\n  (13) \xe2\x80\x9cFire for the cigars, and iced-water for drink.\xe2\x80\x9d--A cry often\r\n  heard in Madrid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had been my parent before he was sixteen; his features were\r\nbeautiful, his figure the most graceful and lover-like I ever beheld,\r\nand his early marriage had preserved him from all the evils of youthful\r\nexcess, and spared the glow of feature, and elasticity of muscle, and\r\ngrace of juvenility, so often withered by vice, almost before they have\r\nbloomed. He was now but twenty-eight, and looked ten years younger. He\r\nwas evidently conscious of this, and as much alive to the enjoyments of\r\nyouth, as if he were still in its spring. He was at the same moment\r\nrushing into all the luxuries of youthful enjoyment and voluptuous\r\nsplendour, and dooming one, who was at least young enough to be his son,\r\nto the frozen and hopeless monotony of a cloister. I laid hold of this\r\nwith the grasp of a drowning man. But a drowning man never grasped a\r\nstraw so weak as he who depends on the worldly feeling of another for\r\nthe support of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasure is very selfish; and when selfishness pleads to selfishness\r\nfor relief, it is like a bankrupt asking his fellow-prisoner to go bail\r\nfor him. This was my conviction at the moment, yet still I reflected,\r\n(for suffering supplies the place of experience in youth, and they are\r\nmost expert casuists who have graduated only in the school of\r\nmisfortune), I reflected, that a taste for pleasure, while it renders a\r\nman selfish in one sense, renders him generous in another. The real\r\nvoluptuary, though he would not part with his slightest indulgence to\r\nsave the world from destruction, would yet wish all the world to be\r\nenjoying itself, (provided it was not at his expence), because his own\r\nwould be increased by it. To this I clung, and intreated my father to\r\nindulge me with another view of the brilliant scene before us. He\r\ncomplied, and his feelings, softened by this compliance, and exhilarated\r\nby the spectacle, (which interested _him_ more than me, who observed it\r\nonly for its effect on him), became more favourable than ever. I availed\r\nmyself of this, and, while returning to the convent, threw the whole\r\npower of my nature and intellect into one (almost) shrieking appeal to\r\nhis heart. I compared myself to the unhappy Esau, deprived of his\r\nbirthright by a younger brother, and I exclaimed in his language, \xe2\x80\x9cHast\r\nthou no blessing for me! Bless me, even me also, Oh my father!\xe2\x80\x9d My\r\nfather was affected; he promised my intreaty every consideration; but he\r\nhinted some difficulty to be encountered on my mother\xe2\x80\x99s part, much on\r\nthat of her Director, who (I afterwards found) governed the whole\r\nfamily, and still more remotely hinted at something insurmountable and\r\ninexplicable. He suffered me, however, to kiss his hand at parting, and\r\nvainly struggled with his emotions when he felt it damp with my tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not till two days after, that I was summoned to attend my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s Director, who was waiting for me in the parlour. I deemed this\r\ndelay the result of a long family debate, or (as it seemed to me)\r\nconspiracy; and I tried to prepare myself for the multifarious warfare\r\nin which I had now to engage with parents, directors, superiors, and\r\nmonks, and boarders, all sworn to win the day, and not caring whether\r\nthey carried their point by storm, sap, mine, or blockade. I began to\r\nmeasure the power of the assailants, and to try to furnish myself with\r\nweapons suited to their various modes of attack. My father was gentle,\r\nflexible, and vacillating. I had _softened_ him in my favour, and I felt\r\nthat was all that could be done with him. But the Director was to be\r\nencountered with different arms. As I went down to the parlour, I\r\ncomposed my looks, my gait, I modulated my voice, I adjusted my dress. I\r\nwas on my guard, body, mind, mien, clothes, every thing. He was a grave,\r\nbut mild-looking ecclesiastic; one must have had the treachery of Judas\r\nto suspect him of treachery. I felt disarmed, I even experienced some\r\ncompunction. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have all this while armed myself\r\nagainst a message of reconciliation.\xe2\x80\x9d The Director began with some\r\ntrifling inquiries about my health, and my progress in study, but he\r\nasked them in a tone of interest. I said to myself, it would not be\r\ndecorous for him to enter on the subject of his visit too soon;--I\r\nanswered him calmly, but my heart palpitated with violence. A silence\r\nensued, and then suddenly turning towards me, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, I\r\nunderstand your objections to a monastic life are insurmountable. I do\r\nnot wonder at it; its habits must appear very unconciliating to youth,\r\nand, in fact, I know not to what period of life abstinence, privation,\r\nand solitude, are particularly agreeable; it was the wish of your\r\nparents doubtless; but\xe2\x80\x9d--This address, so full of candour, almost\r\noverpowered me; caution and every thing else forsook me as I exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what then, my father?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut, I was going to observe, how rarely our\r\nown views coincide with those which others entertain for us, and how\r\ndifficult it is to decide which are the least erroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWas that\r\nall?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shrinking with disappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was all; for\r\ninstance, some people, (of whom I once happened to be one), might be\r\nfanciful enough to imagine, that the superior experience and proved\r\naffection of parents should qualify them to decide on this point better\r\nthan their children; nay, I have heard some carry their absurdity so\r\nfar, as to talk of the rights of nature, the obligations of duty, and\r\nthe useful coercion of restraint; but since I had the pleasure of\r\nbecoming acquainted with your resolution, I am beginning to be of\r\nopinion, that a youth, not thirteen years of age, may be an incomparable\r\njudge in the last resort, particularly when the question bears a\r\ntrifling relation to his eternal as well as temporal interest; in such a\r\ncase, he has doubtless the double advantage of dictating both to his\r\nspiritual and natural parents.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, I beg you to speak without\r\nirony or ridicule; you may be very clever, but I merely wish you to be\r\nintelligible and serious.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish me, then, to speak seriously?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he appeared to _collect_ himself as he asked this question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSeriously, then, my dear child, do you not believe that\r\nyour parents love you? Have you not received from your infancy every\r\nmark of affection from them? Have you not been pressed to their bosoms\r\nfrom your very cradle?\xe2\x80\x9d At these words I struggled vainly with my\r\nfeelings, and wept, while I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, my dear child,\r\nto see you thus overpowered; my object was to appeal to your reason,\r\n(for you have no common share of reasoning power),--and to your reason I\r\nappeal;--can you suppose that parents, who have treated you with such\r\ntenderness, who love you as they do their own souls, could act (as your\r\nconduct charges them) with causeless and capricious cruelty towards you?\r\nMust you not be aware there is a reason, and that it must be a profound\r\none? Would it not be more worthy of your duty, as well as your superior\r\nsense, to inquire into, than contend with it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs it founded upon any\r\nthing in my conduct, then?--I am willing to do every thing,--to\r\nsacrifice every thing.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,--you are willing to do every\r\nthing but what is required of you,--and to sacrifice every thing but\r\nyour own inclination.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut you have hinted at a reason.\xe2\x80\x9d The Director\r\nwas silent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou urged me to inquire into it.\xe2\x80\x9d The Director was silent\r\nstill. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, I adjure you, by the habit you wear, unmuffle this\r\nterrible phantom to me; there is nothing I cannot encounter\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cExcept\r\nthe commands of your parents. But am I at liberty to discover this\r\nsecret to you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Director, in a tone of internal debate. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I\r\nimagine that you, who have in the very outset outraged parental\r\nauthority, will revere parental feelings?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, I do not\r\nunderstand you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, I am compelled to act with a caution\r\nand reserve unsuited to my character, which is naturally as open as\r\nyours. I dread the disclosure of a secret; it is repugnant to my habits\r\nof profound confidence; and I dread disclosing any thing to a character\r\nimpetuous like yours. I feel myself reduced to a most painful\r\nsituation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, act and speak with candour, my situation\r\nrequires it, and your own profession demands it from you. My father,\r\nremember the inscription over the confessional which thrilled my very\r\nblood to read, \xe2\x80\x9cGod hears thee.\xe2\x80\x9d Remember God hears you always, and will\r\nyou not deal sincerely with one whom God has placed at your mercy?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nspoke with much agitation, and the Director appeared affected for a\r\nmoment; that is, he passed his hand over his eyes, which were as dry\r\nas--his heart. He paused for several minutes, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nchild, dare I trust you? I confess I came prepared to treat you like a\r\nboy, but I feel I am disposed to consider you as a man. You have the\r\nintelligence, the penetration, the decision of a man. Have you the\r\nfeelings of one?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTry me, my father.\xe2\x80\x9d I did not perceive that his\r\nirony, his _secret_, and his parade of feeling, were all alike\r\ntheatrical, and substitutionary for real interest and sincerity. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nshould be inclined to trust you, my dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd secret.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd secret, my father.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen imagine yourself\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my\r\nfather, let me not have to _imagine_ any thing--tell me the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish boy,--am I then so bad a painter, that I must write the name\r\nunder the figure.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you, my father, and shall not interrupt\r\nyou again.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen imagine to yourself the honour of one of the first\r\nhouses in Spain; the peace of a whole family,--the feelings of a\r\nfather,--the honour of a mother,--the interests of religion,--the\r\neternal salvation of an individual, all suspended in one scale. What do\r\nyou think could outweigh them?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied ardently. \xe2\x80\x9cYet, in\r\nthe opposite scale you throw _nothing_,--the caprice of a boy not\r\nthirteen years old;--this is all you have to oppose to the claims of\r\nnature, of society, and of God.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, I am penetrated with horror\r\nat what you have said,--does all this depend on me?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt does,--it does\r\nall depend on you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut how, then,--I am bewildered,--I am willing to\r\nmake a sacrifice,--tell me what I am to do.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEmbrace, my dear child,\r\nthe monastic life; this will accomplish the views of all who love you,\r\nensure your own salvation, and fulfil the will of God, who is calling\r\nyou at this moment by the voices of your affectionate parents, and the\r\nsupplications of the minister of heaven, who is now kneeling before\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d And he sunk on his knees before me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis prostration, so unexpected, so revolting, and so like the monastic\r\nhabit of artificial humiliation, completely annihilated the effect of\r\nhis language. I retreated from his arms, which were extended towards me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, _I cannot_,--I will never become a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWretch! and you\r\nrefuse, then, to listen to the call of your conscience, the adjuration\r\nof your parents, and the voice of God?\xe2\x80\x9d The fury with which he uttered\r\nthese words,--the change from a ministering angel to an infuriated and\r\nmenacing demon, had an effect just contrary to what he expected. I said\r\ncalmly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy conscience does not reproach me,--I have never disobeyed its\r\ncalls. My parents have adjured me only through your mouth; and I hope,\r\nfor their sakes, the organ has not been inspired by them. And the voice\r\nof God, echoed from my own heart, bids me not to obey you, by\r\nadulterating his service with prostituted vows.\xe2\x80\x9d As I spoke thus, the\r\nDirector changed the whole character of his figure, his attitude, and\r\nhis language;--from the extreme of supplication or of terror, he passed\r\nin a moment, with the facility of an actor, to a rigid and breathless\r\nsternness. His figure rose from the ground before me like that of the\r\nProphet Samuel before the astonished eyes of Saul. He dropt the\r\ndramatist, and was the monk in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will not take the\r\nvows?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI will not, my father.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will brave the resentment of\r\nyour parents, and the denunciations of the church.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI have done nothing\r\nto deserve either.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut you will encounter both, to cherish your horrid\r\nresolution of being the enemy of God.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am not the enemy of God for\r\nspeaking the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLiar and hypocrite, you blaspheme!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cStop, my\r\nfather, these are words unbecoming your profession, and unsuited to this\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI acknowledge the justice of the rebuke, and submit to it,\r\nthough uttered by the mouth of a child.\xe2\x80\x9d--And he dropped his\r\nhypocritical eyes, folded his hands on his breast, and murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cFiat\r\nvoluntas tua. My dear child, my zeal for the service of God, and the\r\nhonour of your family, to which I am attached equally by principle and\r\naffection, have carried me too far,--I confess it; but have I to ask\r\npardon of you also, my child, for a redundance of that affection and\r\nzeal for your house, which its descendant has proved himself destitute\r\nof?\xe2\x80\x9d The mingled humiliation and irony of this address had no effect on\r\nme. He saw it had not; for after slowly raising his eyes to watch that\r\neffect, he saw me standing in silence, not trusting my voice with a\r\nword, lest I should utter something rash and disrespectful,--not daring\r\nto lift up my eyes, lest their expression should speak without making\r\nlanguage necessary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe the Director felt his situation rather critical; his interest\r\nin the family depended on it, and he attempted to cover his retreat with\r\nall the expertness and fertility of man\xc5\x93uvre which belong to an\r\necclesiastical tactician. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, we have been both wrong, I\r\nfrom zeal, and you from--no matter what; our business is to exchange\r\nforgiveness with each other, and to implore it of God, whom we have both\r\noffended. My dear child, let us prostrate ourselves before him, and even\r\nwhile our hearts are glowing with human passion, God may seize that\r\nmoment to impress the seal of his grace on both, and fix it there for\r\never. Often the earthquake and the whirlwind are succeeded by the still,\r\nsmall voice, and God is there.--Let us pray.\xe2\x80\x9d I fell on my knees,\r\nresolved to pray in my heart; but in a short time, the fervour of his\r\nlanguage, the eloquence and energy of his prayers, dragged me along with\r\nhim, and I felt myself compelled to pray against every dictate of my own\r\nheart. He had reserved this display for the last, and he had judged\r\nwell. I never heard any thing so like inspiration; as I listened, and\r\ninvoluntarily, to effusions that seemed to issue from no mortal lips, I\r\nbegan to doubt my own motives, and search my heart. I had disdained his\r\ntaunts, I had defied and conquered his passion, but as he prayed, I\r\nwept. This going over the same ground with the heart, is one of the most\r\npainful and humiliating of all exercises; the virtue of yesterday\r\nbecomes the vice of to-day; we ask with the desponding and restless\r\nscepticism of Pilate, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is truth?\xe2\x80\x9d but the oracle that was so\r\neloquent one moment, is dumb the next, or if it answers, it is with that\r\nambiguity that makes us dread we have to consult again--again--and for\r\never--in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was now in a state quite fit for the Director\xe2\x80\x99s purpose; but he was\r\nfatigued with the part he had played with so little success, and took\r\nhis leave, imploring me to continue my importunities to Heaven to direct\r\nand enlighten me, while he himself would supplicate all the saints in\r\nheaven to touch the hearts of my parents, and reveal to them some means\r\nof saving me from the crime and perjury of a forced vocation, without\r\n_involving themselves in a crime, if possible, of blacker dye and\r\ngreater magnitude_. Saying so he left me, to urge my parents, with all\r\nhis influence, to pursue the most rigorous measures to enforce my\r\nadoption of the conventual life. His motives for doing so were\r\nsufficiently strong when he visited me, but their strength was increased\r\ntenfold before his departure. He had reckoned confidently on the power\r\nof his remonstrances; he had been repulsed; the disgrace of such a\r\ndefeat rankled in the core of his heart. He had been only a _partizan_\r\nin the cause, but he was now a _party_. What was a matter of conscience\r\nbefore, was now a matter of honour with him; and I rather believe that\r\nthe Director laid a greater stress on the latter, or made a great havock\r\nof confusion between both in his mind. Be that as it may, I passed a few\r\ndays after his visit in a state of indescribable excitement. I had\r\nsomething to hope, and that is often better than something to enjoy. The\r\ncup of hope always excites thirst, that of fruition disappoints or\r\nquenches it. I took long walks in the garden alone. I framed imaginary\r\nconversations to myself. The boarders observed me, and said to each\r\nother, according to their instructions, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is meditating on his\r\nvocation, he is supplicating for illuminating grace, let us not disturb\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d I did not undeceive them; but I reflected with increasing horror\r\non a system that _forced_ hypocrisy to a precocity unparalleled, and\r\nmade the last vice of life the earliest of conventual youth. But I soon\r\nforgot reflection, to plunge into reverie. I imagined myself at the\r\npalace of my father; I saw him, my mother, and the Director, engaged in\r\ndebate. I spoke for each, and felt for all. I supplied the passionate\r\neloquence of the Director, his strong representations of my aversion to\r\nthe habit, his declaration that further importunity on their part would\r\nbe as impious as it was fruitless. I saw all the impression I once\r\nflattered myself I had made on my father revived. I saw my mother yield.\r\nI heard the murmur of doubtful acquiescence,--the decision, the\r\ncongratulations. I saw the carriage approaching,--I heard the convent\r\ndoors fly open. Liberty,--liberty,--I was in their arms; no, I was at\r\ntheir feet. Let those who smile at me, ask themselves whether they have\r\nbeen indebted most to imagination or reality for all they have enjoyed\r\nin life, if indeed they have ever enjoyed any thing. In these internal\r\ndramas, however, I always felt that the persons did not speak with the\r\ninterest I wished; and the speeches I put into their mouths would have\r\nbeen spoken with ten thousand times more animation by myself. Still I\r\nfelt the most exquisite enjoyment in these reveries, and perhaps it was\r\nnot diminished by the thought how I was deceiving my companions the\r\nwhole time. But dissimulation always teaches dissimulation; and the only\r\nquestion is, whether we shall be the masters of the art or its victims?\r\na question soon decided by our self-love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on the sixth day that I heard, with a beating heart, a carriage\r\nstop. I could have sworn to the sound of its wheels. I was in the hall\r\nbefore I was summoned. I felt I could not be in the wrong, nor was I. I\r\ndrove to my father\xe2\x80\x99s palace in a delirium,--a vision of repulse and of\r\nreconciliation, of gratitude and of despair. I was ushered into a room,\r\nwhere were assembled my father, my mother, and the Director, all seated,\r\nand silent as statues. I approached, I kissed their hands, and then\r\nstood at a small distance breathless. My father was the first to break\r\nsilence, but he spoke very much with the air of a man who was repeating\r\na part dictated to him; and the tone of his voice contradicted every\r\nword he _prepared_ to utter. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, I have sent for you, no longer to\r\ncontend with your weak and wicked obstinacy, but to announce to you my\r\nown resolution. The will of Heaven and of your parents has devoted you\r\nto its service, and your resistance can only make us miserable, without\r\nin the least frustrating that resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words, gasping for\r\nbreath, my lips involuntarily unclosed; my father imagined this was an\r\nattempt to reply, though in fact I was not capable of uttering a\r\nsyllable, and hastened to prevent it. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, all opposition is\r\nunavailing, all discussion fruitless. Your destiny is decided, and\r\nthough your struggles may render it wretched, they cannot reverse it. Be\r\nreconciled, my child, to the will of Heaven and your parents, which you\r\nmay insult, but cannot violate. This reverend person can better explain\r\nto you the necessity of your obedience than I can.\xe2\x80\x9d And my father,\r\nevidently weary of a task which he had reluctantly undertaken, was\r\nrising to go away, when the Director detained him. \xe2\x80\x9cStay, Senhor, and\r\nassure your son before you depart, that, since I last saw him, I have\r\nfulfilled my promise, and urged every topic on your mind, and that of\r\nthe duchess, that I thought might operate for his _best interests_.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nwas aware of the hypocritical ambiguity of this expression; and,\r\ncollecting my breath, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cReverend father, as a son I seek not to\r\nemploy an intercessor with my own parents. I stand before them, and if I\r\nhave not an intercessor in their hearts, your mediation must be\r\nineffectual altogether. I implored you merely to state to them my\r\ninvincible reluctance.\xe2\x80\x9d They all interrupted me with exclamations, as\r\nthey repeated my last words,--\xe2\x80\x9cReluctance! invincible! Is it for this\r\nyou have been admitted to our presence? Is it for this we have borne so\r\nlong with your contumacy, only to hear it repeated with aggravations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my father,--yes, for this or nothing. If I am not permitted to\r\nspeak, why am I suffered in your presence?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBecause we hoped to witness\r\nyour submission.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to give the proofs of it on my knees;\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nI fell on my knees, hoping that my posture might soften the effect of\r\nthe words I could not help uttering. I kissed my father\xe2\x80\x99s hand,--he did\r\nnot withdraw it, and I felt it tremble. I kissed the skirt of my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s robe,--she attempted to withdraw it with one hand, but with the\r\nother she hid her face, and I thought I saw tears bursting through her\r\nfingers. I knelt to the Director too, and besought his benediction, and\r\nstruggled, though with revolting lips, to kiss his hand; but he snatched\r\nhis habit from my hand, elevated his eyes, spread out his fingers, and\r\nassumed the attitude of a man who recoils in horror from a being who\r\nmerits the extreme of malediction and reprobation. Then I felt my only\r\nchance was with my parents. I turned to them, but they shrunk from me,\r\nand appeared willing to devolve the remainder of the task on the\r\nDirector. He approached me. \xe2\x80\x9cMy child, you have pronounced your\r\nreluctance to _the life of God_ invincible, but may there not be things\r\nmore invincible even to your resolution? The curses of that God,\r\nconfirmed by those of your parents, and deepened by all the fulminations\r\nof the church, whose embraces you have rejected, and whose holiness you\r\nhave desecrated by that rejection.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFather, these are terrible words,\r\nbut I have no time now but for meanings.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBesotted wretch, I do not\r\nunderstand you,--you do not understand yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I do,--I do!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nexclaimed. And turning to my father, still on my knees, I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndear father, is life,--human life, all shut up from me?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Director, answering for my father. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I no resource?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nprofession?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_Profession!_ degenerate wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLet me embrace the\r\nmeanest, but do not make me a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cProfligate as weak.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! my\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d still calling on my father, \xe2\x80\x9clet not this man answer for you.\r\nGive me a sword,--send me into the armies of Spain to seek death,--death\r\nis all I ask, in preference to that life you doom me to.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nimpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father, gloomily returning from the window against\r\nwhich he had been leaning; \xe2\x80\x9cthe honour of an illustrious family,--the\r\ndignity of a Spanish grandee--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! my father, of how little value will\r\nthat be, when I am consuming in my early grave, and you die\r\nbroken-hearted on it, over the flower your own voice has doomed to\r\nwither there.\xe2\x80\x9d My father trembled. \xe2\x80\x9cSenhor, I entreat,--I command you to\r\nretire; this scene will unfit you for the devotional duties you must\r\nperform this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you leave me then?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried as they\r\ndeparted. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,--yes,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated the Director; \xe2\x80\x9cleave you burdened with\r\nthe curse of your father.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my father; but the\r\nDirector had hold of his hand, and pressed it strongly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf your\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. I heard my mother weep aloud, and felt it like a\r\nrepeal of that curse; but she dared not speak, and I could not. The\r\nDirector had now two victims in his hands, and the third at his feet. He\r\ncould not avoid showing his triumph. He paused, collected the full power\r\nof his sonorous voice, and thundered forth, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd of God!\xe2\x80\x9d And as he\r\nrushed from the room, accompanied by my father and mother, whose hands\r\nhe grasped, I felt as if struck by a thunderbolt. The rushing of their\r\nrobes, as he dragged them out, seemed like the whirlwind that attends\r\nthe presence of the destroying angel. I cried out, in my hopeless agony\r\nof destitution, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! that my brother were here to intercede for\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d--and, as I uttered these words, I fell. My head struck against a\r\nmarble table, and I sunk on the floor covered with blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe domestics (of whom, according to the custom of the Spanish\r\nnobility, there were about two hundred in the palace) found me in this\r\nsituation. They uttered outcries,--assistance was procured,--it was\r\nbelieved that I had attempted to kill myself; but the surgeon who\r\nattended me happened to be a man both of science and humanity, and\r\nhaving cut away the long hair clotted with blood, and surveyed the\r\nwound, he pronounced it trifling. My mother was of his opinion, for\r\nwithin three days I was summoned to her apartment. I obeyed the summons.\r\nA black bandage, severe head-ache, and an unnatural paleness, were the\r\nonly testimonies of my accident, as it was called; and the Director had\r\nsuggested to her that this was the time to FIX THE IMPRESSION. How well\r\nreligious persons understand the secret of making every event of the\r\npresent world operate on the future, while they pretend to make the\r\nfuture predominate over the present. Were I to outlive the age of man, I\r\nshould never forget my interview with my mother. She was alone when I\r\nentered, and seated with her back to me. I knelt and kissed her hand. My\r\npaleness and my submission seemed to affect her,--but she struggled with\r\nher emotions, overcame them, and said in a cold _dictated_ tone, \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nwhat purpose are those marks of exterior reverence, when your heart\r\ndisowns them?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMadam, I am not conscious of that.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot conscious! How\r\nthen are you here? How is it that you have not, long before this, spared\r\nyour father the shame of supplicating his own child,--the shame, still\r\nmore humiliating, of supplicating him in vain; spared the Father\r\nDirector the scandal of seeing the authority of the church violated in\r\nthe person of its minister, and the remonstrances of duty as ineffectual\r\nas the calls of nature? And me,--oh! why have you not spared me this\r\nhour of agony and shame?\xe2\x80\x9d and she burst into a flood of tears, that\r\ndrowned my soul as she shed them. \xe2\x80\x9cMadam, what have I done that deserves\r\nthe reproach of your tears? My disinclination to a monastic life is no\r\ncrime?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn you it is a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut how then, dear mother, were a\r\nsimilar choice offered to my brother, would his rejection of it be\r\ndeemed a crime?\xe2\x80\x9d I said this almost involuntarily, and merely by way of\r\ncomparison. I had no ulterior meaning, nor the least idea that one could\r\nbe developed by my mother, except a reference to an unjustifiable\r\npartiality. I was undeceived, when she added, in a voice that chilled my\r\nblood, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great difference between you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Madam, he is\r\nyour favourite.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I take Heaven to witness,--no;\xe2\x80\x9d and she, who had\r\nappeared so severe, so decisive, and so impenetrable before, uttered\r\nthese words with a sincerity that penetrated to the bottom of my\r\nheart;--she appeared to be appealing to Heaven against the prejudices of\r\nher child. I was affected--I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Madam, this difference of\r\ncircumstances is inexplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you have it explained _by\r\nme_?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBy any one, Madam.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_By me!_\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, not hearing me; then\r\nkissing a crucifix than hung on her bosom, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! the chastisement is\r\njust, and I submit to it, though inflicted by my own child. You are\r\nillegitimate,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning suddenly towards me; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nillegitimate,--your brother is not; and your intrusion into your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house is not only its disgrace, but a perpetual monitor of that\r\ncrime which it aggravates without absolving.\xe2\x80\x9d I stood speechless. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\r\nmy child,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9chave mercy on your mother. Has not this\r\nconfession, extorted from her by her own son, been sufficient to expiate\r\nher offence?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Madam, I can bear any thing now.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou must bear\r\nit, for you have forced me to this disclosure. I am of rank far inferior\r\nto your father,--you were our first child. He loved me, and forgiving my\r\nweakness as a proof of my devotion to him, we were married, and your\r\nbrother is our lawful child. Your father, anxious for my reputation,\r\nsince I was united to him, agreed with me, as our marriage was private,\r\nand its date uncertain, that you should be announced as our legitimate\r\noffspring. For years your grandfather, incensed at our marriage, refused\r\nto see us, and we lived in retirement,--would that I had died there. A\r\nfew days before his death he relented, and sent for us; it was no time\r\nto acknowledge the imposition practised on him, and you were introduced\r\nas the child of his son, and the heir of his honours. But from that hour\r\nI have never known a moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace. The lie I had dared to utter before\r\nGod and the world, and to a dying parent,--the injustice done to your\r\nbrother,--the violation of natural duties and of legal claims,--the\r\nconvulsions of my conscience, that heavily upbraided me, not only with\r\nvice and perjury, but with sacrilege.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSacrilege!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes; every hour you\r\ndelay the assumption of the habit is a robbery of God. Before you were\r\nborn, I devoted you to him, as the only expiation of my crime. While I\r\nyet bore you in my bosom without life, I dared to implore his\r\nforgiveness only on the condition of your future intercession for me as\r\na minister of religion. _I relied on your prayers before you could\r\nspeak._ I proposed to intrust my penitence to one, who, in becoming the\r\nchild of God, had atoned for _my_ offence in making him the child of\r\nsin. In imagination I knelt already at your confessional,--heard you, by\r\nthe authority of the church, and the commission of Heaven, pronounce me\r\nforgiven. I saw you stand beside my dying bed,--I felt you press the\r\ncross to my cold lips, and point to that heaven where I hoped my vow had\r\nalready secured a seat for you. Before your birth I had laboured to lift\r\nyou to heaven, and my recompence is, that your obstinacy threatens to\r\ndrag us both into the gulph of perdition. Oh! my child, if our prayers\r\nand intercessions are available to the delivery of the souls of our\r\ndeparted relatives from punishment, hear the adjuration of a living\r\nparent, who implores you not to seal her everlasting condemnation!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nwas unable to answer, my mother saw it, and redoubled her efforts. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nson, if I thought that my kneeling at your feet would soften your\r\nobduracy, I would prostrate myself before them this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! madam,\r\nthe sight of such unnatural humiliation ought to kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you\r\nwill not yield--the agony of this confession, the interests of my\r\nsalvation and your own, nay, the preservation of my life, are of no\r\nweight with you.\xe2\x80\x9d She perceived that these words made me tremble, and\r\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my life; beyond the day that your inflexibility exposes\r\nme to infamy, I will not live. If you have resolution, I have resolution\r\ntoo; nor do I dread the result, for God will charge on your soul, not on\r\nmine, the crime an unnatural child has forced me to--and yet you will\r\nnot yield.--Well, then, the prostration of my body is nothing to that\r\nprostration of soul you have already driven me to. I kneel to my own\r\nchild for life and for salvation,\xe2\x80\x9d and she knelt to me. I attempted to\r\nraise her; she repelled me, and exclaimed, in a voice hoarse with\r\ndespair, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will not yield?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI do not say so.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what, then,\r\ndo you say?--raise me not, approach me not, till you answer me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat I\r\nwill think.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThink! you must decide.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI do, then, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be whatever you would have me.\xe2\x80\x9d As I uttered these words, my mother\r\nfell in a swoon at my feet. As I attempted to lift her up, scarce\r\nknowing if it was not a corse I held in my arms, I felt I never could\r\nhave forgiven myself if she had been reduced to that situation by my\r\nrefusing to comply with her last request. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was overpowered with congratulations, blessings, and embraces. I\r\nreceived them with trembling hands, cold lips, a rocking brain, and a\r\nheart that felt turned to stone. Every thing passed before me as in a\r\ndream. I saw the pageant move on, without a thought of who was to be the\r\nvictim. I returned to the convent--I felt my destiny was fixed--I had no\r\nwish to avert or arrest it--I was like one who sees an enormous engine\r\n(whose operation is to crush him to atoms) put in motion, and, stupified\r\nwith horror, gazes on it with a calmness that might be mistaken for that\r\nof one who was coolly analysing the complication of its machinery, and\r\ncalculating the resistless crush of its blow. I have read of a wretched\r\nJew(14), who, by the command of a Moorish emperor, was exposed in an\r\narea to the rage of a lion who had been purposely kept fasting for eight\r\nand forty hours. The horrible roar of the famished and infuriated animal\r\nmade even the executioners tremble as they fastened the rope round the\r\nbody of the screaming victim. Amid hopeless struggles, supplications for\r\nmercy, and shrieks of despair, he was bound, raised, and lowered into\r\nthe area. At the moment he touched the ground, he fell prostrate,\r\nstupefied, annihilated. He uttered no cry--he did not draw a breath--he\r\ndid not make an effort--he fell contracting his whole body into a ball,\r\nand lay as senseless as a lump of earth.--So it fared with me; my cries\r\nand struggles were over,--I had been flung into the area, and I lay\r\nthere. I repeated to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am to be a monk,\xe2\x80\x9d and there the debate\r\nended. If they commended me for the performance of my exercises, or\r\nreproved me for my deficiency, I showed neither joy nor sorrow,--I said\r\nonly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am to be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d If they urged me to take exercise in the\r\ngarden of the convent, or reproved me for my excess in walking beyond\r\nthe allotted hours, I still answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI am to be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d I was showed\r\nmuch indulgence in these wanderings. A son--the eldest son of the Duke\r\nde Mon\xc3\xa7ada, taking the vows, was a glorious triumph for the ex-Jesuits,\r\nand they did not fail to make the most of it. They asked what books I\r\nwould like to read,--I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat they pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d They saw I was\r\nfond of flowers, and vases of porcelain, filled with the most exquisite\r\nproduce of their garden, (renewed every day), embellished my apartment.\r\nI was fond of music,--that they perceived from my involuntary joining in\r\nthe choir. My voice was good, and my profound melancholy gave an\r\nexpression to my tones, which these men, always on the watch to grasp at\r\nany thing that may aggrandize them, or delude their victims, assured me\r\nwere like the tones of inspiration.\r\n\r\n  (14) Vide Buffa--_Anachronism prepense_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmid these displays of indulgence, I exhibited an ingratitude totally\r\nforeign from my character. I never read the books they furnished me\r\nwith,--I neglected the flowers with which they filled my room,--and the\r\nsuperb organ they introduced into my apartment, I never touched, except\r\nto elicit some deep and melancholy chords from its keys. To those who\r\nurged me to employ my talents for painting and music, I still answered\r\nwith the same apathetic monotony, \xe2\x80\x9cI am to be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my brother,\r\nthe love of flowers, of music, of all that can be consecrated to God, is\r\nalso worthy of the attention of man--you abuse the indulgence of the\r\nSuperior.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou must, in gratitude to God, thank him for\r\nthese lovely works of his creation;\xe2\x80\x9d--the room was at this time filled\r\nwith carnations and roses;--\xe2\x80\x9cyou must also be grateful to him for the\r\npowers with which he has distinguished you in hymning his praises--your\r\nvoice is the richest and most powerful in the church.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother, you answer at random.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJust as I feel--but don\xe2\x80\x99t heed\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWill you take a turn in the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you please.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOr will\r\nyou seek a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consolation from the Superior?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you speak with such apathy? are the odour of the flowers,\r\nand the consolations of your Superior, to be appreciated in the same\r\nbreath?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI believe so.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am to be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNay,\r\nbrother, will you never utter any thing but that phrase, which carries\r\nno meaning with it but that of stupefaction or delirium?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cImagine me,\r\nthen, stupefied, delirious--what you please--you know I must be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAt these words, which I suppose I uttered in a tone unlike that of the\r\nusual _chaunt_ of monastic conversation, another interposed, and asked\r\nwhat I was uttering in so loud a key? \xe2\x80\x9cI am only saying,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I must be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThank God it is no worse,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nquerist, \xe2\x80\x9cyour contumacy must long ago have wearied the Superior and the\r\nbrethren--thank God it\xe2\x80\x99s no worse.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words I felt my passions\r\nresuscitated,--I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9c_Worse!_ what have I to dread?--am I not to\r\nbe a monk?\xe2\x80\x9d From that evening, (I forget when it occurred), my liberty\r\nwas abridged; I was no longer suffered to walk, to converse with the\r\nboarders or novices,--a separate table was spread for me in the\r\nrefectory,--the seats near mine were left vacant at service,--yet still\r\nmy cell was embellished with flowers and engravings, and\r\nexquisitely-wrought toys were left on my table. I did not perceive they\r\nwere treating me as a lunatic, yet certainly my foolishly reiterated\r\nexpressions might have justified them in doing so,--they had their own\r\nplans in concert with the Director,--my silence went for proof. The\r\nDirector came often to visit me, and the hypocritical wretches _would_\r\naccompany him to my cell. I was generally (for want of other occupation)\r\nattending to my flowers, or gazing at the engravings,--and they would\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see he is as happy as he wishes to be--he wants for\r\nnothing--he is quite occupied in watching those roses.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not\r\noccupied,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cit is occupation I want.\xe2\x80\x9d Then they shrugged\r\ntheir shoulders, exchanged mysterious looks with the Director, and I was\r\nglad when they were gone, without reflecting on the mischief their\r\nabsence threatened me with. At this moment, consultation after\r\nconsultation was held at the palace de Mon\xc3\xa7ada, whether I could be\r\ninduced to shew sufficient intellect to enable me to pronounce the vows.\r\nIt seems the reverend fathers were as anxious as their old enemies the\r\nMoors, to convert an idiot into a saint. There was now a party combined\r\nagainst me, that it would have required more than the might of man to\r\nresist. All was uproar from the palace de Mon\xc3\xa7ada to the convent, and\r\nback again. I was mad, _contumacious_, heretical, idiotical,--any\r\nthing--every thing--that could appease the jealous agony of my parents,\r\nthe cupidity of the monks, or the ambition of the ex-Jesuits, who\r\nlaughed at the terror of all the rest, and watched intently over their\r\nown interests. Whether I was mad or not, they cared very little; to\r\nenroll a son of the first house of Spain among their converts, or to\r\nimprison him as a madman, or to exorcise him as a demoniac, was all the\r\nsame to them. There was a _coup de theatre_ to be exhibited, and\r\nprovided they played first parts, they cared little about the\r\ncatastrophe. Luckily, during all this uproar of imposture, fear,\r\nfalsehood, and misrepresentation, the Superior remained steady. He let\r\nthe tumult go on, to aggrandize his importance; but he was resolved all\r\nthe time that I should have sanity enough to enable me to take the vows.\r\nI knew nothing of all this, but was astonished at being summoned to the\r\nparlour on the last eve of my noviciate. I had performed my religious\r\nexercises with regularity, had received no rebukes from the master of\r\nthe novices, and was totally unprepared for the scene that awaited me.\r\nIn the parlour were assembled my father, mother, the Director, and some\r\nother persons whom I did not recognize. I advanced with a calm look, and\r\nequal step. I believe I was as much in possession of my reason as any\r\none present. The Superior, taking my arm, led me round the room, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see----\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted him--\xe2\x80\x9cSir, what is this intended for?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nanswered only by putting his finger on his lips, and then desired me to\r\nexhibit my drawings. I brought them, and offered them on one knee, first\r\nto my mother, and then to my father. They were sketches of monasteries\r\nand prisons. My mother averted her eyes--and my father said, pushing\r\nthem away, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no taste in those things.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are fond of music\r\ndoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Superior; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must hear his performance.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwas a small organ in the room adjacent to the parlour; my mother was not\r\nadmitted there, but my father followed to listen. Involuntarily I\r\nselected an air from the \xe2\x80\x9cSacrifice of Jephtha.\xe2\x80\x9d My father was affected,\r\nand bid me cease. The Superior imagined this was not only a tribute to\r\nmy talent, but an acknowledgement of the power of his party, and he\r\napplauded without measure or judgement. Till that moment, I had never\r\nconceived I could be the object of a party in the convent. The Superior\r\nwas determined to make me a Jesuit, and therefore was pledged for my\r\n_sanity_. The monks wished for an exorcism, an _auto de fe_, or some\r\nsuch bagatelle, to diversify the dreariness of monasticism, and\r\ntherefore were anxious I should be, or appear, deranged or possessed.\r\nTheir pious wishes, however, failed. I had appeared when summoned,\r\n_behaved_ with scrupulous correctness, and the next day was appointed\r\nfor my taking the vows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat next day--Oh! that I could describe it!--but it is impossible--the\r\nprofound stupefaction in which I was plunged prevented my noticing\r\nthings which would have inspired the most uninterested spectator. I was\r\nso absorbed, that though I remember facts, I cannot paint the slightest\r\ntrace of the feelings which they excited. During the night I slept\r\nprofoundly, till I was awoke by a knock at my door.--\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, how\r\nare you employed?\xe2\x80\x9d I knew the voice of the Superior, and I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfather, I was sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was macerating myself at the foot of the\r\naltar for you, my child,--the scourge is red with my blood.\xe2\x80\x9d I returned\r\nno answer, for I felt the maceration was better merited by the betrayer\r\nthan the betrayed. Yet I was mistaken; for in fact, the Superior felt\r\nsome compunction, and had undergone this penance on account of my\r\nrepugnance and alienation of mind, more than for his own offences. But\r\nOh! _how false is a treaty made with God, which we ratify with our own\r\nblood_, when he has declared there is but one sacrifice he will accept,\r\neven that of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world! Twice in\r\nthe night, I was thus disturbed, and twice answered in the same\r\nlanguage. The Superior, I make no doubt, was sincere. He thought he was\r\ndoing all for God, and his bleeding shoulders testified his zeal. But I\r\nwas in such a state of mental ossification, that I neither felt, heard,\r\nor understood; and when he knocked a second and third time at the door\r\nof my cell to announce the severity of his macerations, and the efficacy\r\nof his intercessions with God, I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cAre not criminals allowed to\r\nsleep the night before their execution?\xe2\x80\x9d At hearing these words, which\r\nmust have made him shudder, the Superior fell prostrate before the door\r\nof my cell, and I turned to sleep again. But I could hear the voices of\r\nthe monks as they raised the Superior, and bore him to his cell. They\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is incorrigible--you humiliate yourself in vain--when he is\r\n_ours_, you shall see him a different being--he shall then prostrate\r\nhimself before you.\xe2\x80\x9d I heard this, and slept on. The morning came--I\r\nknew what it would bring--I dramatized the whole scene in my own mind. I\r\nimagined I witnessed the tears of my parents, the sympathy of the\r\ncongregation. I thought I saw the hands of the priests tremble as they\r\ntossed the incense, and even the acolytes shiver as they held their\r\nrobes. Suddenly my mind changed: I felt--what was it I felt?--a union of\r\nmalignity, despair, and power, the most formidable. Lightning seemed\r\nflashing from my eyes as I reflected,--I might make the sacrificers and\r\nthe sacrificed change places in one moment,--I might blast my mother as\r\nshe stood, by a word,--I might break my father\xe2\x80\x99s heart, by a single\r\nsentence,--I might scatter more desolation around me, than it was\r\napparently possible for human vice, human power, or human malignity,\r\nmore potent than both, to cause to its most abject victim.--Yes!--on\r\nthat morning I felt within myself the struggles of nature, feeling,\r\ncompunction, pride, malevolence, and despair.--The former I had brought\r\nwith me, the latter had been all acquired in the convent. I said to\r\nthose who attended me that morning, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are arraying me for a victim,\r\nbut I can turn the executioners into the victims if I please\xe2\x80\x9d--and I\r\nlaughed. The laugh terrified those who were about me--they\r\nretreated--they represented my state to the Superior. He came to my\r\napartment. The whole convent was by this time alarmed--their credit was\r\nat stake--the preparations had all been made--the whole world was\r\ndetermined I was to be a monk, mad or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Superior was terrified, I saw, as he entered my apartment. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son,\r\nwhat means all this?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNothing, my father--nothing but a sudden thought\r\nthat has struck me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe will discuss it another time, my son; at\r\npresent--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_At present_,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated with a laugh that must have\r\nlacerated the Superior\xe2\x80\x99s ears--\xe2\x80\x9cAt present I have but one alternative to\r\npropose--let my father or my brother take my place--that is all. I will\r\nnever be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d The Superior, at these words, ran in despair round the\r\ncell. I followed him, exclaiming, in a voice that must have filled him\r\nwith horror, \xe2\x80\x9cI exclaim against the vows--let those who forced me to it,\r\ntake the guilt on themselves--let my father, in his own person, expiate\r\nhis guilt in bringing me into the world--let my brother sacrifice his\r\npride--why must I be the only victim of the crime of the one, and the\r\npassions of the other?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, all this was arranged before.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\r\nknow that--I know that by a decree of the Almighty I was doomed to be\r\ncursed even in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb, but I will never subscribe that decree\r\nwith my own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, what can I say to you--you have passed your\r\nnoviciate.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, in a state of stupefaction.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll Madrid is assembled\r\nto hear you take your vows.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen all Madrid shall hear me renounce\r\nthem, and disavow them.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the very day fixed on. The ministers\r\nof God are prepared to yield you to his arms. Heaven and earth,--all\r\nthat is valuable in time, or precious in eternity, are summoned, are\r\nwaiting for the irrevocable words that seal your salvation, and ensure\r\nthat of those you love. What demon has taken possession of you, my\r\nchild, and seized the moment you were coming to Christ, to cast you\r\ndown, and tear you? How shall I--how shall the fraternity, and all the\r\nsouls who are to escape from punishment by the merit of your prayers,\r\nanswer to God for your horrible apostacy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLet them answer for\r\nthemselves--let every one of us answer for ourselves--that is the\r\ndictate of reason.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOf reason, my deluded child,--when had reason any\r\nthing to do with religion?\xe2\x80\x9d I had sat down, folded my arms on my breast,\r\nand forbore to answer a word. The Superior stood with his arms crossed,\r\nhis head declined, his whole figure in an air of profound and mortified\r\ncontemplation. Any one else would have imagined him seeking God in the\r\nabysses of meditation, but I felt he was only seeking him where he is\r\nnever to be found,--in the abyss of that heart which is \xe2\x80\x9cdeceitful and\r\ndesperately wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d He approached--I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cCome not near me!--you\r\nwill renew again the story of my submission--I tell you it was\r\nartificial;--of my regularity in devotional exercises--it was all\r\nmechanism or imposture;--of my conformity to discipline--it was all\r\npractised with the hope of escaping from it ultimately. Now, I feel my\r\nconscience discharged and my heart lightened. Do you hear, do you\r\nunderstand me? These are the first words of truth I ever uttered since I\r\nentered these walls--the only ones that will, perhaps, ever be uttered\r\nwithin them--aye, treasure them up, knit your brows, and cross yourself,\r\nand elevate your eyes as you will. Go on with your religious drama. What\r\nis there you see before you so horrible, that you recoil, that you cross\r\nyourself, that you lift your eyes and hands to heaven?--a creature whom\r\ndespair has driven to utter desperate truth! Truth may be horrible to\r\nthe inmates of a convent, whose whole life is artificial and\r\nperverted,--whose very hearts are sophisticated beyond the hand even of\r\nHeaven (which they alienate by their hypocrisy) to touch. But I feel I\r\nam at this moment an object of less horror in the sight of the Deity,\r\nthan if I were standing at his altar, to (as you would urge me) insult\r\nhim with vows, which my heart was bursting from my bosom to contradict,\r\nat the moment I uttered them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt these words, which I must have uttered with the most indecent and\r\ninsulting violence, I almost expected the Superior would have struck me\r\nto the earth,--would have summoned the lay-brothers to bear me to\r\nconfinement,--would have shut me up in the dungeon of the convent, for I\r\nknew there was such a place. Perhaps I wished for all this. Driven to\r\nextremity myself, I felt a kind of pride in driving others to it in\r\nreturn. Any thing of violent excitement, of rapid and giddy vicissitude,\r\nor even of intense suffering, I was prepared for, and equal to, at that\r\nmoment. But these paroxysms soon exhaust themselves and us by their\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nAstonished by the Superior\xe2\x80\x99s silence, I raised my eyes to him. I said,\r\nin a tone of moderation that seemed unnatural to my own ears, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\r\nme hear my sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent still. He had _watched the crisis_,\r\nand now skilfully seized the turn of the mental disease, to exhibit his\r\napplications. He was standing before me meek and motionless, his arms\r\ncrossed, his eyes depressed, not the slightest indication of resentment\r\nto be traced in his whole figure. The folds of his habit, refusing to\r\nannounce his internal agitation, seemed as they were cut out of stone.\r\nHis silence imperceptibly softened me,--I blamed myself for my violence.\r\nThus men of the world command us by their passions, and men of the other\r\nworld by the apparent suppression of them. At last he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, you\r\nhave revolted from God, resisted his Holy Spirit, profaned his\r\nsanctuary, and insulted his minister,--in his name and my own I forgive\r\nyou all. Judge of the various characters of our systems, by their\r\ndifferent results on us two. You revile, defame, and accuse,--I bless\r\nand forgive; which of us is then under the influence of the gospel of\r\nChrist, and within the pale of the church\xe2\x80\x99s benediction? But leaving\r\nthis question, which you are not at present in a frame to decide, I\r\nshall urge but one topic more; if that fails, I shall no longer oppose\r\nyour wishes, or urge you to prostitute a sacrifice which man would\r\ndespise, and God must disdain. I add, I will even do my utmost to\r\nfacilitate your wishes, which are now in fact my own.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words,\r\nso full of truth and benignity, I was rushing to prostrate myself at his\r\nfeet, but fear and experience checked me, and I only bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cPromise me\r\nmerely that you will wait with patience till this last topic is urged;\r\nwhether it succeeds or not I have now little interest, and less care.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\npromised,--he went out. A few moments after he returned. His air was a\r\nlittle more disturbed, but still struggling for a calmness of\r\nexpression. There was agitation about him, but I knew not whether it was\r\nfelt on his own account or mine. He held the door half open, and his\r\nfirst sentence astonished me.--\xe2\x80\x9cMy son, you are well acquainted with the\r\nclassical histories.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is that to the purpose, my father?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nremember a remarkable story of the Roman general, who spurned from the\r\nsteps of his tribune, people, senators, and _priests_,--trampled on all\r\nlaw,--outraged all religion,--but was at last moved by nature, for, when\r\nhis mother prostrated herself before him, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98My son, before\r\nyou tread the streets of Rome, you must first tread on the body of her\r\nwho bore you!\xe2\x80\x99 he relented.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI remember all, but to what does this\r\ntend?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_To this_,\xe2\x80\x9d and he threw open the door; \xe2\x80\x9cnow, prove yourself, if\r\nyou can, more obdurate than a heathen.\xe2\x80\x9d As the door opened, across the\r\nthreshold lay my mother, prostrate on her face. She said in a stifled\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cAdvance,--break your vows,--but you must rush to perjury over\r\nthe body of your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d I attempted to raise her, but she clung to the\r\nground, repeating the same words; and her magnificent dress, that\r\noverspread the floor of stone with gems and velvet, frightfully\r\ncontrasted her posture of humiliation, and the despair that burned in\r\nher eyes, as she raised them to me for a moment. Convulsed with agony\r\nand horror, I reeled into the arms of the Superior, who seized that\r\nmoment to bear me to the church. My mother followed,--the ceremony\r\nproceeded. I vowed chastity, poverty, and obedience, and in a few\r\nmoments my destiny was decided. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDay followed day for many a month, of which I have no recollections,\r\nnor wish to have any. I must have experienced many emotions, but they\r\nall subsided like the waves of the sea under the darkness of a midnight\r\nsky,--their fluctuation continues, but there is no light to mark their\r\nmotion, or trace when they rise and fall. A deep stupor pervaded my\r\nsenses and soul; and perhaps, in this state, I was best fitted for the\r\nmonotonous existence to which I was doomed. It is certain that I\r\nperformed all the conventual functions with a regularity that left\r\nnothing to be blamed, and an apathy that left nothing for praise. My\r\nlife was a sea without a tide. The bell did not toll for service with\r\nmore mechanical punctuality than I obeyed the summons. No automaton,\r\nconstructed on the most exquisite principles of mechanism, and obeying\r\nthose principles with a punctuality almost miraculous, could leave the\r\nartist less room for complaint or disappointment, than I did the\r\nSuperior and community. I was always first in my place in the choir. I\r\nreceived no visits in the parlour,--when I was permitted to go, I\r\ndeclined the permission. If penance was enjoined, I submitted; if\r\nrelaxation was permitted, I never partook of it. I never asked a\r\ndispensation from morning prayers, or from vigils. I was silent in the\r\nrefectory,--in the garden I walked alone. I neither thought, nor felt,\r\nnor lived,--if life depends on consciousness, and the motions of the\r\nwill. I slept through my existence like the Simorgh in the Eastern\r\nfable, but this sleep was not to last long. My abstraction and calmness\r\nwould not do for the Jesuits. My stupor, my noiseless tread, my fixed\r\neyes, my ghastly silence, might indeed have impressed a superstitious\r\ncommunity with the idea that it was no human creature who stalked\r\nthrough their cloisters, and haunted their choir. But they had quite\r\ndifferent ideas. They considered all this as a tacit reproach to the\r\nstruggles, the squabbles, the intrigues, and the circumventions, in\r\nwhich they were immersed, body and soul, from morn till night. Perhaps\r\nthey thought I was lying in reserve, only to watch them. Perhaps there\r\nmight have been a dearth of some matter of curiosity or complaint in the\r\nconvent just then,--a very little serves for either. However it was,\r\nthey began to revive the old story of my being deranged, and resolved to\r\nmake the most of it. They whispered in the refectory, consulted in the\r\ngarden,--shook their heads, pointed at me in the cloister, and finally,\r\nI faithfully believe, worked themselves into the conviction that what\r\nthey wished or imagined was actually true. Then they all felt their\r\nconsciences interested in the investigation; and a select party, headed\r\nby an old monk of influence and reputation, waited on the Superior. They\r\nstated to him my abstraction, my mechanical movements, my automaton\r\nfigure, my meanless words, my stupified devotion, my total alienation\r\nfrom the spirit of the monastic life, while my scrupulous, _wooden_,\r\n_jointless_ exactness in its forms was only a mockery. The Superior\r\nheard them with great indifference. He had held secret intelligence with\r\nmy family, had communicated with the Director, and pledged himself that\r\nI should be a monk. He had succeeded by dint of exertions, (the result\r\nof which has been seen), and now cared very little whether I was mad or\r\nnot. With a grave air he forbid their further interference in the\r\nmatter, and reserved its future cognizance to himself. They retired\r\ndefeated, but not disappointed, and they all pledged themselves to each\r\nother to _watch me_; that is, to harass, persecute, and torment me into\r\nbeing the very character with which their malice, their curiosity, or\r\ntheir mere industry of idleness and wantonness of unoccupied invention,\r\nhad invested me already. From that hour the whole convent was in a\r\ntumult of conspiracy and combination. Doors were clapped to wherever I\r\nwas heard to approach; and three or four would stand whispering near\r\nwhere I walked, and clear their throats, and exchange signs, and pass\r\n_audibly_ to the most trifling topics in my hearing, as if to intimate,\r\nwhile they affected to conceal it, that their last topic had been _me_.\r\nI laughed at this internally. I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor perverted beings,\r\nwith what affectation of dramatic bustle and contrivance you labour to\r\ndiversify the misery of your hopeless vacancy;--you struggle,--I\r\nsubmit.\xe2\x80\x9d Soon the toils they were preparing began to tighten round me.\r\nThey would throw themselves in my way with an assiduity I could not\r\navoid, and an appearance of kindness I did not willingly repel. They\r\nwould say, in the blandest tones, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear brother, you are\r\nmelancholy,--you are devoured with chagrin,--would to God our fraternal\r\nefforts could banish your regrets. But from what arises that melancholy\r\nthat appears to consume you?\xe2\x80\x9d At these words I could not help fixing on\r\nthem eyes full of reproaches, and I believe of tears,--but I did not\r\nutter a word. The state in which they saw me, was a sufficient cause for\r\nthe melancholy with which I was reproached. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis attack having failed, another method was tried. They attempted to\r\nmake me a party in the parties of the convent. They told me a thousand\r\nthings of unjust partialities,--of unjust punishments, daily to be\r\nwitnessed in the convent. They talked of a sickly brother being\r\ncompelled to attend matins, while the physician pronounced his\r\nattendance on them must be his death,--_and he died_,--while a young\r\nfavourite, in the bloom of health, had a dispensation from matins\r\nwhenever he pleased to lie till nine in the morning;--of complaints that\r\nthe confessional was not attended to as it ought,--and this might have\r\nmade some impression on me, till another complainant added, and the\r\n_turning-box is not attended to as it ought to be_. This union of\r\ndissonant sounds,--this startling transition from a complaint of\r\nneglecting the mysteries of the soul in its profoundest communion with\r\nGod, to the lowest details of the abuses of conventual discipline,\r\nrevolted me at once. I had with difficulty concealed my disgust till\r\nthen, and it was now so obvious, that the _party_ gave up their attempt\r\nfor the moment, and beckoned to an _experienced_ monk to join me in my\r\nsolitary walk, as I broke from them. He approached, \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother, you are\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to be so.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am not obliged to announce my\r\nreasons.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTrue, but you may confide them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to\r\nconfide.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI know that,--I would not for the world intrude on your\r\nconfidence; reserve that for friends more honoured.\xe2\x80\x9d It struck me as\r\nrather odd, that he should, in the same breath, ask for my\r\nconfidence,--declare that he was conscious I had nothing to intrust to\r\nhim,--and, lastly, request a reserve of my confidence for some more\r\nfavoured friend. I was silent, however, till he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my brother,\r\nyou are devoured with ennui.\xe2\x80\x9d I was silent still. \xe2\x80\x9cWould to God I could\r\nfind the means to dissipate it.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, looking on him calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nthose means to be found within the walls of a convent?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear\r\nbrother,--yes, certainly,--the debate in which the convent is now\r\nengaged about the proper hour for matins, which the Superior wants to\r\nhave restored to the original hour.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the difference?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_Full\r\nfive minutes._\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI confess the importance of the question.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! if you\r\nonce begin to feel it, there will be no end of your happiness in a\r\nconvent. There is something every moment to inquire, to be anxious\r\nabout, and to contend for. Interest yourself, my dear brother, in these\r\nquestions, and you will not have a moment\xe2\x80\x99s ennui to complain of.\xe2\x80\x9d At\r\nthese words I fixed my eyes on him. I said calmly, but I believe\r\nemphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cI have, then, only to excite in my own mind, spleen,\r\nmalignity, curiosity, every passion that your retreat should have\r\nafforded me protection against, to render that retreat supportable.\r\nPardon me, if I cannot, like you, beg of God permission to take his\r\nenemy into compact against the corruption which I promote, while I\r\npresume to pray against it.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent, lifted up his hands, and\r\ncrossed himself; and I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive your hypocrisy,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nhe went into another walk, and repeated to his companions, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is mad,\r\nirrecoverably mad.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut how, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said several voices. There was a\r\nstifled whisper. I saw several heads bent together. I did not know what\r\nthey were meditating, nor did I care. I was walking alone,--it was a\r\ndelicious moon-light evening. I saw the moon-beams through the trees,\r\nbut the trees all looked to me like walls. Their trunks were as adamant,\r\nand the interlaced branches seemed to twine themselves into folds that\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond us there is no passing.\xe2\x80\x9d I sat down by the side of a\r\nfountain,--there was a tall poplar over it,--I remember their situation\r\nwell. An elderly priest (who, I did not see, was detached by the party)\r\nsat down beside me. He began some common-place observations on the\r\ntransiency of human existence. I shook my head, and he understood, by a\r\nkind of tact not uncommon among Jesuits, that _it would not do_. He\r\nshifted the subject, remarked on the beauty of the foliage, and the\r\nlimpid purity of the fountain. I assented. He added, \xe2\x80\x9cOh that life were\r\npure as that stream!\xe2\x80\x9d I sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh that life were verdant and fertile\r\nto me as that tree!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my son, may not fountains be dried up, and\r\ntrees be withered?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my father,--yes,--the fountain of my life has\r\nbeen dried up, and the green branch of my life has been blasted for\r\never.\xe2\x80\x9d As I uttered these words, I could not suppress some tears. The\r\nfather seized on what he called the moment when God was breathing on my\r\nsoul. Our conversation was very long, and I listened to him with a kind\r\nof reluctant and stubborn attention, because I had involuntarily been\r\ncompelled to observe, that he was the only person in the whole community\r\nwho had never harassed me by the slightest importunity either before my\r\nprofession or after; and when the worst things were said of me, never\r\nseemed to attend; and when the worst things were predicted of me, shook\r\nhis head and said nothing. His character was unimpeached, and his\r\nreligious performances as exemplary and punctual as my own. With all\r\nthis I felt no confidence in him, or in any human being; but I listened\r\nto him with patience, and my patience must have had no trivial trial,\r\nfor, at the end of an hour, (I did not perceive that our conference was\r\npermitted quite beyond the usual hour of retirement), he continued\r\nrepeating, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear son, you will become reconciled to the conventual\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, never, never,--unless this fountain is dried up, and\r\nthis tree withered, by to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, God has often performed\r\ngreater miracles for the salvation of a soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe parted, and I retired to my cell. I know not how he and the others\r\nwere employed, but, before matins, there was such a tumult in the\r\nconvent, that one would have thought Madrid was on fire. Boarders,\r\nnovices, and monks, ran about from cell to cell, up and down the\r\nstair-case, through all the corridors, unrestrained and\r\nunquestioned,--all order was at an end. No bell was rung, no commands\r\nfor restoring tranquillity issued; the voice of authority seemed to have\r\nmade peace for ever with the shouts of uproar. From my window I saw them\r\nrunning through the garden in every direction, embracing each other,\r\nejaculating, praying, and counting their beads with hands tremulous, and\r\neyes uplifted in extacy. The hilarity of a convent has something in it\r\nuncouth, unnatural, and even alarming. I suspected some mischief\r\nimmediately, but I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cThe worst is over, they cannot make\r\nme more than a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d--I was not long left in doubt. Many steps\r\napproached my cell, numerous voices were repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cHasten, dear\r\nbrother, hasten to the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d I was left no choice; they surrounded\r\nand almost bore me to the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole community were assembled there, the Superior among them not\r\nattempting to suppress the confusion, but rather encouraging it. There\r\nwas a suffusion of joy in every countenance, and a kind of artificial\r\nlight in every eye, but the whole performance struck me as hollow and\r\nhypocritical. I was led, or rather hurried to the spot where I had sat\r\nand conversed so long the preceding evening. _The fountain was dried up,\r\nand the tree was withered._ I stood speechless with astonishment, while\r\nevery voice around me repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cA miracle! a miracle!--God himself has\r\nsealed your vocation with his own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d The Superior made a signal to\r\nthem to stop. He said to me in a calm voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, you are required\r\nonly to believe the evidence of your own eyes. Will you make infidels of\r\nyour very senses, sooner than believe God? Prostrate yourself, I adjure\r\nyou, before him this moment, and, by a public and solemn act of faith,\r\nrecognise that mercy that has not scrupled a miracle to invite you to\r\nsalvation.\xe2\x80\x9d I was amazed more than touched by what I saw and heard, but\r\nI threw myself on my knees before them all, as I was directed. I clasped\r\nmy hands, and said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God, if you have indeed vouchsafed this\r\nmiracle on my account, you will also doubtless enrich and illuminate me\r\nwith grace to apprehend and appreciate it. My mind is dark, but you can\r\nilluminate it. My heart is hard, but it is not beyond the power of\r\nomnipotence to touch and subdue it. An impression made on it this\r\nmoment, a whisper sent to its recesses, is not less worthy of your mercy\r\nthan an impression on inanimate matter, which only confounds my senses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe Superior interrupted me. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cHold, those are not the words you\r\nshould use. Your very faith is incredulous, and your prayer an ironical\r\ninsult on the mercy it pretends to supplicate.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, put what\r\nwords you please in my mouth, and I will repeat them,--if I am not\r\nconvinced, I am at least subdued.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou must ask pardon of the community\r\nfor the offence your _tacit_ repugnance to the life of God has caused\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d I did so. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must express your gratitude to the community for\r\nthe joy they have testified at this miraculous evidence of the truth of\r\nyour vocation.\xe2\x80\x9d I did so. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must also express your gratitude to God,\r\nfor a visible interposition of supernatural power, not more to the\r\nvindication of his grace, than to the eternal honour of this house,\r\nwhich he has been pleased to irradiate and dignify by _a miracle_.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nhesitated a little. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, may I be permitted to utter this\r\nprayer internally?\xe2\x80\x9d The Superior hesitated too; he thought it might not\r\nbe well to push matters too far, and he said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cAs you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI was still kneeling on the ground, close to the tree and the fountain.\r\nI now prostrated myself, with my face to the earth, and prayed\r\ninternally and intensely, while they all stood around me; but the\r\nlanguage of my prayer was very different from what they flattered\r\nthemselves I was uttering. On rising from my knees, I was embraced by\r\nhalf the community. Some of them actually shed tears, the source of\r\nwhose fountain was surely not in their hearts. Hypocritical joy insults\r\nonly its dupe, but hypocritical grief degrades the professor. That whole\r\nday was passed in a kind of revelry. Exercises were abridged,--the\r\nrefections embellished with confectionary,--every one had permission to\r\ngo from cell to cell, without an order from the Superior. Presents of\r\nchocolate, snuff, iced water, liqueurs, and (what was more acceptable\r\nand necessary than any of them) napkins and towels of the finest and\r\nwhitest damask, circulated among all the members. The Superior was shut\r\nup half the day with two _discreet_ brethren, as they are called, (that\r\nis, men who are elected to take part with the Superior, on supposition\r\nof their utter, superannuated incapacity, as Pope Sixtus was elected for\r\nhis (supposed) imbecillity), preparing an authenticated account of the\r\nmiracle, to be dispatched to the principal convents in Spain. There was\r\nno need to distribute the intelligence through Madrid,--they were in\r\npossession of it an hour after it happened,--the malicious say _an hour\r\nbefore_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must confess the agitating exhilaration of this day, so unlike what I\r\nhad ever witnessed before in a convent, produced an effect on me I\r\ncannot describe. I was caressed,--made the hero of the _fete_,--(a\r\nconventual fete has always something odd and unnatural in it),--almost\r\ndeified. I gave myself up to the intoxication of the day,--I did verily\r\nbelieve myself the favourite of the Deity for some hours. I said to\r\nmyself a thousand flattering things. If this deception was criminal, I\r\nexpiated my crime very soon. The next day every thing was restored to\r\nits usual order, and I found that the community could pass from the\r\nextreme of disorder in a moment to the rigidity of their usual habits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy conviction of this was certainly not diminished within the few\r\nfollowing days. The oscillations of a convent vibrate within a very\r\nshort interval. One day all is relaxation, another all is inexorable\r\ndiscipline. Some following days I received a striking proof of that\r\nfoundation on which, in despite of a miracle, my repugnance to a\r\nmonastic life rested. Some one, it was said, had committed a slight\r\nbreach of monastic duty. The _slight breach_ was _fortunately_ committed\r\nby a distant relation of the Archbishop of Toledo, and consisted _merely\r\nin his entering the church intoxicated_, (a rare vice in Spaniards),\r\nattempting to drag the matin preacher from the pulpit, and failing in\r\nthat, getting astride as well as he could on the altar, dashing down the\r\ntapers, overturning the vases and the pix, and trying to scratch out, as\r\nwith the talons of a demon, the painting that hung over the table,\r\nuttering all the while the most horrible blasphemies, and even\r\n_soliciting the portrait of the Virgin_ in language not to be repeated.\r\nA consultation was held. The community, as may be guessed, was in an\r\nuproar while it lasted. Every one but myself was anxious and agitated.\r\nThere was much talk of the inquisition,--the scandal was so\r\natrocious,--the outrage so unpardonable,--and atonement so\r\nimpracticable. Three days afterwards the archbishop\xe2\x80\x99s mandate came to\r\nstop all proceedings; and the following day the youth who had committed\r\nthis sacrilegious outrage appeared in the hall of the Jesuits, where the\r\nSuperior and a few monks were assembled, read a short exercise which one\r\nof them had written for him on the pithy word \xe2\x80\x9cEbrietas,\xe2\x80\x9d and departed\r\nto take possession of a large benefice in the diocese of the archbishop\r\nhis relative. The very next day after this scandalous scene of\r\ncompromise, imposture, and profanation, a monk was detected in the act\r\nof going, after the permitted hour, to an adjacent cell to return a book\r\nhe had borrowed. As a punishment for this offence, he was compelled to\r\nsit for three days at refection, while we were dining, barefooted and\r\nhis tunic reversed, on the stone floor of the hall. He was compelled to\r\naccuse himself aloud of every crime, and of many not at all fit to be\r\nmentioned to our ears, and exclaim at every interval, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God, my\r\npunishment is just.\xe2\x80\x9d On the second day, it was found that a mat had been\r\nplaced under him by some merciful hand. There was an immediate commotion\r\nin the hall. The poor wretch was labouring under a complaint that made\r\nit worse than death to him to be compelled to sit or rather lie on a\r\nstone floor; some merciful being had surreptitiously conveyed to him\r\nthis mat. An investigation was immediately commenced. A youth whom I had\r\nnot noticed before, started from the table, and kneeling to the\r\nSuperior, confessed _his guilt_. The Superior assumed a stern look,\r\nretired with some old monks to consult on this new crime of humanity,\r\nand in a few moments the bell was rung, to give every one notice to\r\nretire to their cells. We all retired trembling, and while we prostrated\r\nourselves respectively before the crucifix in our cells, wondered who\r\nwould be the next victim, or what might be his punishment. I saw that\r\nyouth but once again. He was the son of a wealthy and powerful family,\r\nbut even his wealth was no balance against his contumacy, in the opinion\r\nof the convent, that is, of four monks of rigid principles, whom the\r\nSuperior consulted that very evening. The Jesuits are fond of courting\r\npower, but they are still fonder of keeping it, if they can, to\r\nthemselves. The result of their debate was, that the offender should\r\nundergo a severe humiliation and penance in their presence. His sentence\r\nwas announced to him, and he submitted to it. He repeated every word of\r\ncontrition they dictated to him. He then bared his shoulders, and\r\napplied the scourge till the blood flowed, repeating between every\r\nstroke, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God, I ask pardon of thee for having given the slightest\r\ncomfort or relief to Fra Paolo, during his merited penance.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nperformed all this, cherishing in the bottom of his soul an intention\r\nstill to comfort and relieve Fra Paolo, whenever he could find\r\nopportunity. He then thought all was over. He was desired to retire to\r\nhis cell. He did so, but the monks were not satisfied with this\r\nexamination. They had long suspected Fra Paolo of irregularity, and\r\nimagined they might extort the confession of it from this youth, whose\r\nhumanity increased their suspicion. The virtues of nature are always\r\ndeemed vices in a convent. Accordingly, he had hardly been in bed when\r\nthey surrounded him. They told him they came by command of the Superior\r\nto enjoin him a further penance, unless he disclosed the secret of the\r\ninterest he felt for Fra Paolo. It was in vain he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no\r\ninterest but that of humanity and compassion.\xe2\x80\x9d Those were words they did\r\nnot understand. It was in vain he urged, \xe2\x80\x9cI will inflict whatever\r\npenance the Superior is pleased to order, but my shoulders are bleeding\r\nstill,\xe2\x80\x9d--and he shewed them. The executioners were pitiless. They\r\ncompelled him to quit his bed, and applied the scourge with such\r\noutrageous severity, that at last, mad with shame, rage, and pain, he\r\nburst from them, and ran through the corridor calling for assistance or\r\nfor mercy. The monks were in their cells, none dared to stir,--they\r\nshuddered, and turned on their straw pallets. It was the vigil of Saint\r\nJohn the Lesser, and I had been commanded what is called in convents an\r\nhour of recollection, which was to be passed in the church. I had obeyed\r\nthe order, and remained with my face and body prostrate on the marble\r\nsteps of the altar, till I was almost unconscious, when I heard the\r\nclock strike twelve. I reflected the hour had elapsed without a single\r\nrecollection on my part. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus it is to be always,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed,\r\nrising from my knees; \xe2\x80\x9cthey deprive of the power of thinking, and then\r\nthey bid me recollect.\xe2\x80\x9d As I returned through the corridor, I heard\r\nfrightful cries--I shuddered. Suddenly a phantom approached me--I dropt\r\non my knees--I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cSatana vade retro--apage Satana.\xe2\x80\x9d A naked human\r\nbeing, covered with blood, and uttering screams of rage and torture,\r\nflashed by me; four monks pursued him--they had lights. I had shut the\r\ndoor at the end of the gallery--I felt they must return and pass me--I\r\nwas still on my knees, and trembling from head to foot. The victim\r\nreached the door, found it shut, and rallied. I turned, and saw a groupe\r\nworthy of Murillo. A more perfect human form never existed than that of\r\nthis unfortunate youth. He stood in an attitude of despair--he was\r\nstreaming with blood. The monks, with their lights, their scourges, and\r\ntheir dark habits, seemed like a groupe of demons who had made prey of a\r\nwandering angel,--the groupe resembled the infernal furies pursuing a\r\nmad Orestes. And, indeed, no ancient sculptor ever designed a figure\r\nmore exquisite and perfect than that they had so barbarously mangled.\r\nDebilitated as my mind was by the long slumber of all its powers, this\r\nspectacle of horror and cruelty woke them in a moment. I rushed forward\r\nin his defence--I struggled with the monks--I uttered some expressions\r\nwhich, though I hardly was conscious of, they remembered and exaggerated\r\nwith all the accuracy of malice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no recollection of what followed; but the issue of the business\r\nwas, that I was confined to my cell for the following week, for my\r\ndaring interference in the discipline of the convent. And the additional\r\npenance of the unfortunate novice, for resisting that discipline, was\r\ninflicted with such severity, that he became delirious with shame and\r\nagony. He refused food, he got no rest, and died the eighth night after\r\nthe scene I had witnessed. He was of a temper unusually mild and\r\namiable--he had a taste for literature, and even the disguise of a\r\nconvent could not conceal the distinguished graces of his person and\r\nmanners. Had he lived in the world, how these qualities would have\r\nembellished it! Perhaps the world would have abused and perverted\r\nthem--true; but would the abuses of the world ever have brought them to\r\nso frightful and disastrous a conclusion?--would he have been first\r\nlashed into madness, and then lashed out of existence? He was interred\r\nin the church of the convent, and the Superior himself pronounced his\r\neulogium--the Superior! by whose order, or else permission, or at least\r\nconnivance, he had been driven mad, in order to obtain a trivial and\r\nimaginary secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9dDuring this exhibition, my disgust arose to a degree incalculable. I\r\nhad loathed the conventual life--I now despised it; and every judge of\r\nhuman nature knows, that it is harder to eradicate the latter sentiment\r\nthan the former. I was not long without an occasion for the renewed\r\nexercise of both feelings. The weather was intensely hot that year--an\r\nepidemic complaint broke out in the convent--every day two or three were\r\nordered to the infirmary, and those who had merited slight penances were\r\nallowed, by way of commutation, to attend the sick. I was most anxious\r\nto be of the number--I was even resolved, by some slight deviation, to\r\ntempt this punishment, which would have been to me the highest\r\ngratification. Dare I confess my motive to you, Sir? I was anxious to\r\nsee those men, if possible, divested of the conventual disguise, and\r\nforced to sincerity by the pangs of disease, and the approach of death.\r\nI triumphed already in the idea of their dying confession, of hearing\r\nthem acknowledge the seductions employed to ensnare me, deplore the\r\nmiseries in which they had involved me, and implore, with convulsed\r\nlips, my pardon in--_no--not in vain_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis wish, though vindictive, was not without its palliations; but I\r\nwas soon saved the trouble of realizing it at my own expence. That very\r\nevening the Superior sent for me, and desired me to attend in the\r\ninfirmary, allowing me, at the same time, remission from vespers. The\r\nfirst bed I approached, I found Fra Paolo extended on. He had never\r\nrecovered the effects of the complaint he laboured under at the time of\r\nhis penance; and the death of the young novice so (fruitlessly incurred)\r\nhad been mortal to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offered him medicines--I attempted to adjust him in his bed. He had\r\nbeen greatly neglected. He repelled both offers, and, feebly waving his\r\nhand, said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me, at least, die in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d A few moments after, he\r\nunclosed his eyes, and recognized me. A gleam of pleasure trembled over\r\nhis countenance, for he remembered the interest I had shewn for his\r\nunfortunate friend. He said, in a voice hardly intelligible, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is you,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my brother, it is I--can I do any thing for you?\xe2\x80\x9d After a\r\nlong pause, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you can.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTell me then.\xe2\x80\x9d He lowered his\r\nvoice, which was before almost inaudible, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cLet none of\r\nthem come near me in my dying moments--it will not give you much\r\ntrouble--those moments are approaching.\xe2\x80\x9d I pressed his hand in token of\r\nacquiescence. But I felt there was something at once terrifying and\r\nimproper in this request from a dying man. I said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nbrother, you are then dying?--would you not wish an interest in the\r\nprayers of the community?--would you not wish the benefit of the last\r\nsacraments?\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his head, and I fear that I understood him too\r\nwell. I ceased any further importunity; and a few moments he uttered, in\r\ntones I could hardly distinguish, \xe2\x80\x9c_Let them, let me die._--They have\r\nleft me no power to form another wish.\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes closed,--I sat beside\r\nhis bed, holding his hand in mine. At first, I could feel he attempted\r\nto press it--the attempt failed, his hold relaxed. Fra Paolo was no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI continued to sit holding the dead hand in mine, till a groan from an\r\nadjacent bed roused me. It was occupied by the old monk with whom I had\r\nheld a long conversation the night before the miracle, in which I still\r\nbelieved most firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have observed, that this man was of a temper and manners remarkably\r\nmild and attractive. Perhaps this is always connected with great\r\nweakness of intellect, and coldness of character _in men_. (It may be\r\ndifferent in women--but my own experience has never failed in the\r\ndiscovery, that where there was a kind of feminine softness and\r\npliability in the male character, there was also treachery,\r\ndissimulation, and heartlessness.) At least, if there be such an union,\r\na conventual life is sure to give it every advantage in its range of\r\ninternal debility, and external seductiveness.--That pretence of a wish\r\nto assist, without the power, or even the wish, that is so flattering\r\nboth to the weak minds that exercise it, and the weaker on whom it is\r\nexercised. This man had been always judged very weak, and yet very\r\nfascinating. He had been always employed to ensnare the young novices.\r\nHe was now dying--overcome by his situation, I forgot every thing but\r\nits tremendous claims, and offered him every assistance in my power. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant nothing but to die,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer. His countenance was perfectly\r\ncalm, but its calmness was rather that of apathy than of resignation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are, then, perfectly sure of your approach to blessedness?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nnothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow, my brother, are those words for a dying man to\r\nutter?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, if he speaks the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut a monk?--a catholic?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThose\r\nare but names--I feel _that truth_, at least, now.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou amaze me!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncare not--I am on the verge of a precipice--I must plunge from it--and\r\nwhether the by-standers utter outcries or not, is a matter of little\r\nconsequence to me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, you expressed a willingness to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingness! Oh impatience!--I am a clock that has struck the same\r\nminutes and hours for sixty years. Is it not time for the machine to\r\nlong for its winding up? The monotony of my existence would make a\r\ntransition, even to pain, desirable. I am weary, and would change--that\r\nis all.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut to me, and to all the community, you seemed to be resigned\r\nto the monastic life.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI seemed a lie--I lived a lie--I was a lie--I\r\nask pardon of my last moments for speaking the truth--I presume they\r\nneither can refuse me, or discredit my words--I hated the monastic life.\r\nInflict pain on man, and his energies are roused--condemn him to\r\ninsanity, and he slumbers like animals that have been found inclosed in\r\nwood and stone, torpid and content; but condemn him at once to pain and\r\ninanity, as they do in convents, and you unite the sufferings of hell\r\nand of annihilation. For sixty years I have cursed my existence. I never\r\nwoke to hope, for I had nothing to do or to expect. I never lay down\r\nwith consolation, for I had, at the close of every day, only to number\r\nso many deliberate mockeries of God, as exercises of devotion. The\r\nmoment life is put beyond the reach of your will, and placed under the\r\ninfluence of mechanical operations, it becomes, to thinking beings, a\r\ntorment insupportable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never ate with appetite, because I knew, that with or without it, I\r\nmust go to the refectory when the bell rung. I never lay down to rest in\r\npeace, because I knew the bell was to summon me in defiance of nature,\r\nwhether it was disposed to prolong or shorten my repose. I never prayed,\r\nfor my prayers were dictated to me. I never hoped, for my hopes were\r\nfounded not on the truth of God, but on the promises and threatenings of\r\nman. My salvation hovered on the breath of a being as weak as myself,\r\nwhose weakness I was nevertheless obliged to flatter, and struggle to\r\nobtain a gleam of the grace of God, through the dark distorted medium of\r\nthe vices of man. _It never reached me_--I die without light, hope,\r\nfaith, or consolation.\xe2\x80\x9d--He uttered these words with a calmness that was\r\nmore terrific than the wildest convulsions of despair. I gasped for\r\nbreath--\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my brother, you were always punctual in your religious\r\nexercises.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat was mechanism--will you not believe a dying man?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou urged me, in a long conversation, to embrace the monastic life; and\r\nyour importunity must have been sincere, for it was after my\r\nprofession.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is natural for the miserable to wish for companions in\r\ntheir misery. This is very selfish, very misanthropic, you will say, but\r\nit is also very natural. You have yourself seen the cages suspended in\r\nthe cells--are not the tame birds always employed to allure the wild\r\nones? We were caged birds, can you blame us for the deception?\xe2\x80\x9d In these\r\nwords I could not help recognizing that _simplicity of profound\r\ncorruption_(15),--that frightful paralysis of the soul, which leaves it\r\nincapable of receiving any impression or making one,--that says to the\r\naccuser, Approach, remonstrate, upbraid--I defy you. My conscience is\r\ndead, and can neither hear, utter, or echo a reproach. I was amazed--I\r\nstruggled against my own conviction. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut your regularity in\r\nreligious exercises--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_Did you never hear a bell toll?_\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut your\r\nvoice was always the loudest and most distinct in the choir.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_Did you\r\nnever hear an organ played?_\xe2\x80\x9d * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n  (15) Vide Madame Genlis\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cJulien Delmour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shuddered, yet I still went on with my queries--I thought I could not\r\nknow too much. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my brother, the religious exercises in\r\nwhich you were constantly engaged, must have imperceptibly instilled\r\nsomething of their spirit into you?--is it not so? You must have passed\r\nfrom the forms of religion into its spirit ultimately?--is it not so, my\r\nbrother? Speak on the faith of a dying man. May I have such a hope! I\r\nwould undergo any thing--any thing, to obtain it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such\r\nhope,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dying man, \xe2\x80\x9cdeceive not yourself with it. The repetition\r\nof religious duties, without the feeling or spirit of religion, produces\r\nan incurable callosity of heart. There are not more irreligious people\r\nto be found on earth than those who are occupied always in its\r\n_externals_. I verily believe half our lay-brothers to be Atheists. I\r\nhave heard and read something of those whom we call heretics. They have\r\npeople to open their pews, (shocking profanation you will call it, to\r\nsell seats in the house of God, and you are right), they have people to\r\nring bells when their dead are to be interred; and these wretches have\r\nno other indication of religion to give, but watching during the whole\r\ntime of service, (in which their duties forbid them to partake), for the\r\nfees which they extort, and dropping upon their knees, ejaculating the\r\nnames of Christ and God, amid the rattling of the pew-doors, which\r\nalways operates on their associations, and makes them bound from their\r\nknees to gape for a hundredth part of the silver for which Judas sold\r\nhis Saviour and himself. Then their bell-ringers--one would imagine\r\n_death might humanize them_. Oh! no such thing--they _extort money in\r\nproportion to the depth of the grave_. And the bell-ringer, the sexton,\r\nand the survivors, fight sometimes a manual battle over the senseless\r\nremains, whose torpidity is the most potent and silent reproach to this\r\nunnatural conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d I knew nothing of this, but I grasped at his former\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cYou die, then, without hope or confidence?\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent. \xe2\x80\x9cYet\r\nyou urged me by eloquence almost divine, by a miracle verified before my\r\nown eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed. There is something very horrible in the laugh of\r\na dying man: Hovering on the verge of both worlds, he seems to give the\r\nlie to both, and proclaim the enjoyments of one, and the hopes of\r\nanother, alike an imposture. \xe2\x80\x9cI performed that miracle myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nwith all the calmness, and, alas! something of the triumph of a\r\ndeliberate impostor. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew the reservoir by which the fountain was\r\nsupplied--by consent of the Superior it was drawn off in the course of\r\nthe night. We worked hard at it, and laughed at your credulity every\r\npump we drew.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut the tree--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI was in possession of some chemical\r\nsecrets--I have not time to disclose them now--I scattered a certain\r\nfluid over the leaves of the poplar that night, and they _appeared_\r\nwithered by the morning--go look at them a fortnight hence, and you will\r\nsee them as green as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd these are your dying words?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why did you deceive me thus?\xe2\x80\x9d He struggled a short time at\r\nthis question, and then rising almost upright in his bed, exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was a monk, and wished for victims of my imposture to gratify\r\nmy pride! and companions of my misery, to soothe its malignity!\xe2\x80\x9d He was\r\nconvulsed as he spoke, the natural mildness and calmness of his\r\nphysiognomy were changed for something that I cannot describe--something\r\nat once derisive, triumphant, and diabolical. I forgave him every thing\r\nin that horrible moment. I snatched a crucifix that lay by his bed--I\r\noffered it to his lips. He pushed it away. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I wanted to have this\r\nfarce acted, I should choose another actor. You know I might have the\r\nSuperior and half the convent at my bed-side this moment if I pleased,\r\nwith their tapers, their holy water, and their preparations for extreme\r\nunction, and all the masquerade of death, by which they try to dupe even\r\nthe dying, and insult God even on the threshold of his own eternal\r\nmansion. I suffered you to sit beside me, because I thought, from your\r\nrepugnance to the monastic life, you might be a willing hearer of its\r\ndeceptions, and its despair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeplorable as had been the image of that life to me before, this\r\nrepresentation exceeded my imagination. I had viewed it as excluding all\r\nthe enjoyments of life, and thought the prospect blasting; but now the\r\nother world was weighed in the balance, and found wanting. The genius of\r\nmonasticism seemed to wield a two-edged sword, and to lift it between\r\nand against time and eternity. The blade bore a two-fold inscription--on\r\nthe side next the world was written the word \xe2\x80\x9csuffer,\xe2\x80\x9d--on that opposed\r\nto eternity, \xe2\x80\x9cdespair.\xe2\x80\x9d In the utter hopelessness of my soul, I still\r\ncontinued to question _him_ for hope--him! while he was bereaving me of\r\nits very shadow, by every word he uttered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, must all be plunged in\r\nthis abyss of darkness? Is there no light, no hope, no refuge, for the\r\nsufferer? May not some of us become reconciled to our situation--first\r\npatient of it, then attached to it? Finally, may we not (if our\r\nrepugnance be invincible) make a merit of it with God, and offer to him\r\nthe sacrifice of our earthly hopes and wishes, in the confidence of an\r\nample and glorious equivalent? Even if we are unable to offer this\r\nsacrifice with the unction which would ensure its acceptance, still may\r\nwe not hope it will not be wholly neglected?--that we may become\r\ntranquil, if not happy--resigned, if not content. Speak, tell me if this\r\nmay be?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you wish to extort deception from the lips of death--but\r\nyou will fail. Hear your doom--Those who are possessed of what may be\r\ncalled the religious character, that is, those who are visionary, weak,\r\nmorose, and ascetic, may elevate themselves to a species of intoxication\r\nin the moments of devotion. They may, while clasping the images, work\r\nthemselves into the delusion, that the dead stone thrills to their\r\ntouch; that the figures move, assent to their petitions, and turn their\r\nlifeless eyes on them with an expression of benignity. They may, while\r\nkissing the crucifix, believe that they hear celestial voices\r\npronouncing their pardon; that the Saviour of the world extends his arms\r\nto them, to invite them to beatitude; that all heaven is expanded to\r\ntheir view, and the harmonies of paradise are enriched to glorify their\r\napotheosis. But this is a mere inebriation that the most ignorant\r\nphysician could produce in his patients by certain medicines. The secret\r\nof this ecstatic swoon might be traced to an apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s shop, or\r\npurchased at a cheaper rate. The inhabitants of the north of Europe\r\nprocure this state of exaltation by the use of liquid fire--the Turks by\r\nopium--the Dervises by dancing--and Christian monks by spiritual pride\r\noperating on the exhaustion of a macerated frame. It is all\r\nintoxication, with this difference only, that the intoxication of men of\r\nthis world produces always _self_-complacency--that of men of the other\r\nworld, a complacency whose supposed source is derived from God. The\r\nintoxication is, therefore, more profound, more delusive, and more\r\ndangerous. But nature, violated by these excesses, exacts a most\r\nusurious interest for this illicit indulgence. She makes them pay for\r\nmoments of rapture with hours of despair. Their precipitation from\r\nextasy to horror is almost instantaneous. In the course of a few\r\nmoments, they pass from being the favourites of Heaven to becoming its\r\noutcasts. They doubt the truth of their raptures,--the truth of their\r\nvocation. They doubt every thing--the sincerity of their prayers, even\r\nthe efficacy of the Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s atonement, and the intercession of the\r\nblessed Virgin. They plunge from paradise to hell. They howl, they\r\nscream, they blaspheme. From the bottom of the infernal gulph in which\r\nthey imagine themselves plunged, they bellow imprecations against their\r\nCreator--they denounce themselves as damned from all eternity for their\r\nsins, while their only sin is their inability to support preternatural\r\nexcitement. The paroxysm ceases, they become the elect of God again in\r\ntheir own imaginations. And to those who interrogate them with regard to\r\ntheir late despair, they answer, That Satan was permitted to buffet\r\nthem--that they were under the hidings of God\xe2\x80\x99s face, &c. All saints,\r\nfrom Mahomet down to Francis Xavier, were only a compound of insanity,\r\npride, and self-imposition;--the latter would have been of less\r\nconsequence, but that men always revenge their imposition on themselves,\r\nby imposing to the utmost on others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no more horrible state of mind than that in which we are\r\n_forced by conviction to listen on, wishing every word to be false, and\r\nknowing every word to be true_. Such was mine, but I tried to palliate\r\nit by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was never my ambition to be a saint; but is the lot of\r\nall, then, so deplorable?\xe2\x80\x9d The monk, who appeared to rejoice in this\r\nopportunity to discharge the concentrated malignity of sixty years of\r\nsuffering and hypocrisy, collected his dying voice to answer. He seemed\r\nas if he never could inflict enough, for what had been inflicted on\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cThose who possess strong sensibility, without the religious\r\ncharacter, are of all others the most unhappy, but their miseries are\r\nsoonest terminated. They are harassed by trivial constraints, stupified\r\nby monotonous devotion, exasperated by dull insolence and bloated\r\nsuperiority. They struggle, they resist. Penance and punishment are\r\napplied. Their own violence justifies increased violence of treatment;\r\nand, at all events, it would be applied without this justification, for\r\nthere is nothing that delights the pride of power, more than a\r\nvictorious strife with the pride of intellect. The remainder is easily\r\nto be conceived by you, who have witnessed it. You saw the unfortunate\r\nyouth who interfered about Paolo. He was lashed to madness. Tortured\r\nfirst to phrenzy, then to stupefaction,--he died! I was the secret,\r\nunsuspected adviser of the whole proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMonster!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed,\r\nfor truth had made us equal _now_, and even precluded the language that\r\nhumanity would dictate when uttered to a dying man.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d--said\r\nhe, with that calmness which had once attracted, and now revolted me,\r\nbut which had at all times undisputed possession of his\r\nphysiognomy;--\xe2\x80\x9chis sufferings were shorter, do you blame me for\r\ndiminishing their duration?\xe2\x80\x9d--There was something cold, ironical, and\r\njeering, even in the suavity of this man, that gave a certain force to\r\nhis simplest observations. It seemed as if he had reserved the truth all\r\nhis life, to utter it at his dying hour. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch is the fate of those who\r\npossess strong sensibility; those who have less languish away in an\r\nimperceptible decline. They spend their time in watching a few flowers,\r\nin tending birds. They are punctual in their religious exercises, they\r\nreceive neither blame or praise,--they melt away in torpor and ennui.\r\nThey wish for death, as the preparation it might put the convent to\r\nmight produce a short excitement, but they are disappointed, for their\r\nstate forbids excitement, and they die as they have lived,--unexcited,\r\nunawakened. The tapers are lit, they do not see them,--the unction is\r\napplied, they do not feel it,--prayers are uttered, they cannot partake\r\nin them;--in fact, the whole drama is acted, but the principal performer\r\nis absent,--is gone. Others indulge themselves in perpetual reverie.\r\nThey walk alone in the cloister,--in the garden. They feed themselves\r\nwith the poison of delicious, innutritive illusion. They dream that an\r\nearthquake will shake the walls to atoms, that a volcano will burst\r\nforth in the centre of the garden. They imagine a revolution of\r\ngovernment,--an attack of banditti,--any thing, however improbable. Then\r\nthey take refuge in the possibility of a fire, (if a fire bursts out in\r\na convent, the doors are thrown open, and \xe2\x80\x9cSauve qui peut,\xe2\x80\x9d is the\r\nword). At this thought they conceive the most ardent hope,--they could\r\nrush out,--they could precipitate themselves into the streets, into the\r\ncountry,--in fact, they would fly any where to escape. Then these hopes\r\nfail,--they begin to get nervous, morbid, restless. If they have\r\ninterest, they are indulged with remission from their duties, and they\r\nremain in their cells, relaxed,--torpid,--idiotical; if they have not\r\ninterest, they are forced to the punctual performance of their duties,\r\nand then idiotism comes on much sooner, as diseased horses, employed in\r\na mill, become blind sooner than those who are suffered to wear out\r\nexistence in ordinary labour. Some of them take refuge in religion, as\r\nthey call it. They call for relief on the Superior, but what can the\r\nSuperior do? He is but human too, and perhaps feels the despair that is\r\ndevouring the wretches who supplicate him to deliver them from it. Then\r\nthey prostrate themselves before the images of the saints,--they invoke,\r\nthey sometimes revile them. They call for their intercession, deplore\r\nits inefficacy, and fly to some other, whose merits they imagine are\r\nhigher in the sight of God. They supplicate for an interest in the\r\nintercession of Christ and the Virgin, as their last resort. That resort\r\nfails them too,--the Virgin herself is inexorable, though they wear out\r\nher pedestal with their knees, and her feet with their kisses. Then they\r\ngo about the galleries at night, they rouse the sleepers, they knock at\r\nevery door,--they cry, \xe2\x80\x9cBrother Saint Jerome, pray for me,--Brother\r\nSaint Augustine, pray for me.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the placard is seen fastened to the\r\nrails of the altar, \xe2\x80\x9cDear brothers, pray for the wandering soul of a\r\nmonk.\xe2\x80\x9d The next day the placard bears this inscription, \xe2\x80\x9cThe prayers of\r\nthe community are implored for a monk who is in despair.\xe2\x80\x9d Then they find\r\nhuman intercession as unavailing as divine, to procure them a remission\r\nof the sufferings which, while _their profession_ continues to inflict\r\non them, no power can reverse or mitigate. They crawl to their\r\ncells,--in a few days the toll of the bell is heard, and the brethren\r\nexclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cHe died in the odour of sanctity,\xe2\x80\x9d and hasten to spread their\r\nsnares for another victim.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is this, then, monastic life?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis,--there are but two exceptions, that of those who can every day\r\nrenew, by the aid of imagination, the hope of escape, and who cherish\r\nthat hope even on their dying bed; and those who, like me, diminish\r\ntheir misery by dividing it, and, like the spider, feel relieved of the\r\npoison that swells, and would burst them, by instilling a drop of it\r\ninto every insect that toils, agonizes, and perishes in their\r\nnet,--_like you_.\xe2\x80\x9d At these last words, a glare of malignity flashed on\r\nthe features of the dying wretch, that appalled me. I retreated from his\r\nbed for a moment. I returned, I looked at him,--his eyes were\r\nclosed,--his hands extended. I touched him,--raised him,--he was\r\ndead,--those were his last words. The expression of his features was the\r\nphysiognomy of his soul,--they were calm and pale, but still a cold\r\nexpression of derision lingered about the curve of his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rushed from the infirmary. I was at that time indulged, like all the\r\nother visitants of the sick, to go to the garden beyond the allotted\r\nhours, perhaps to diminish the chance of infection. I was but too ready\r\nto avail myself of this permission. The garden, with its calm moon-light\r\nbeauty, its innocence of heaven, its theology of the stars, was at once\r\na reproach and a consolation to me. I tried to reflect, to feel,--both\r\nefforts failed; and perhaps it is in this silence of the soul, this\r\nsuspension of all the clamorous voices of the passions, that we are most\r\nready to hear the voice of God. My imagination suddenly represented to\r\nme the august and ample vault above me as a church,--the images of the\r\nsaints grew dim in my eyes as I gazed on the stars, and even the altar,\r\nover which the crucifixion of the Saviour of the world was represented,\r\nturned pale to the eye of the soul, as I gazed on the moon \xe2\x80\x9cwalking in\r\nher brightness.\xe2\x80\x9d I fell on my knees. I knew not to whom I was about to\r\npray, but I never felt so disposed to pray. I felt my habit touched at\r\nthis moment. I at first trembled, from the idea of being detected in a\r\nforbidden act. I started up. A dark figure stood beside me, who said in\r\nindistinct and faultering tones, \xe2\x80\x9cRead this,\xe2\x80\x9d and he thrust a paper into\r\nmy hand; \xe2\x80\x9cI have worn it sewed into my habit for four days. I have\r\nwatched you night and day. I had no opportunity but this,--you were in\r\nyour cell, in the choir, or in the infirmary. Tear it in pieces, throw\r\nthe fragments into the fountain, or _swallow them_, the moment you have\r\nread it.--Adieu. I have risked every thing for you,\xe2\x80\x9d and he glided away.\r\nI recognized his figure as he departed; it was the porter of the\r\nconvent. I well understood the risk he must have run in delivering this\r\npaper, for it was the regulation of the convent, that all letters,\r\nwhether addressed to or written by boarders, novices, or monks, were\r\nfirst to be read by the Superior, and I never knew an instance of its\r\ninfringement. The moon gave me sufficient light. I began to read, while\r\na vague hope, that had neither object or basis, trembled at the bottom\r\nof my heart. The paper contained these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest brother, (my God! how I started!) I see you revolt at the\r\nfirst lines which I address to you,--I implore you, for both our sakes,\r\nto read them with calmness and attention. We have been both the victims\r\nof parental and priestly imposition; the former we must forgive, for our\r\nparents are the victims of it too. The Director has their consciences in\r\nhis hand, and their destiny and ours at his feet. Oh, my brother, what a\r\ntale have I to disclose to you! I was brought up, by the Director\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norders, whose influence over the domestics is as unbounded as it is over\r\ntheir unhappy master, in complete hostility against you, as one who was\r\ndepriving me of my natural rights, and degrading the family by your\r\nillegitimate intrusion. May not this palliate, in some degree, my\r\nunnatural repulsiveness when we first met? I was taught from my cradle\r\nto hate and fear you,--to hate you as an enemy, and fear you as an\r\nimpostor. This was the Director\xe2\x80\x99s plan. He thought the hold he had over\r\nmy father and mother too slight to gratify his ambition of domestic\r\npower, or realize his hopes of professional distinction. The basis of\r\nall ecclesiastical power rests upon fear. A crime must be discovered or\r\ninvented. The vague reports circulated in the family, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconstant dejection, my father\xe2\x80\x99s occasional agitation, offered him a\r\nclue, which he followed with incessant industry through all its windings\r\nof doubt, mystery, and disappointment, till, in a moment of penitence,\r\nmy mother, terrified by his constant denunciations if she concealed any\r\nsecret of her heart or life from him, disclosed the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were both infants then. He adopted immediately the plan he has since\r\nrealized at the expence of all but himself. I am convinced he had not,\r\nfrom the first hour of his machinations, the least malignity against\r\nyou. The aggrandizement of his interest, which ecclesiastics always\r\nindividualize with that of the church, was his only object. To dictate,\r\nto tyrannize, to manage a whole family, and that of rank, by his\r\nknowledge of the frailty of one of its members, was all he looked to.\r\nThose who by their vows are excluded from the interest which natural\r\naffections give us in life, must seek for it in the artificial ones of\r\npride and domination, and the Director found it there. All thenceforth\r\nwas conducted and inspired by him. It was he who caused us to be kept\r\nasunder from our infancy, fearful that nature might frustrate his\r\nplans,--it was he who reared me in sentiments of implacable animosity\r\nagainst you. When my mother fluctuated, he reminded her of her vow, with\r\nwhich she had rashly intrusted him. When my father murmured, the shame\r\nof my mother\xe2\x80\x99s frailty, the bitter feuds of domestic discussion, the\r\ntremendous sounds of imposture, perjury, sacrilege, and the resentment\r\nof the church, were thundered in his ears. You may conceive there is\r\nnothing this man would shrink at, when, almost in my childhood, he\r\ndisclosed to me my mother\xe2\x80\x99s frailty, to insure my early and zealous\r\nparticipation in his views. Heaven blast the wretch who could thus\r\ncontaminate the ears, and wither the heart of a child, with the tale of\r\na parent\xe2\x80\x99s shame, to secure a partizan for the church! This was not all.\r\nFrom the first hour I was able to hear and comprehend him, he poisoned\r\nmy heart by every channel he could approach. He exaggerated my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npartiality for you, which he assured me often contended vainly with her\r\nconscience. He represented my father as weak and dissipated, but\r\naffectionate; and, with the natural pride of a boy-father, immoveably\r\nattached to his eldest offspring. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, prepare yourself to\r\nstruggle with a host of prejudices,--the interests of God, as well as of\r\nsociety, demand it. _Assume a high tone with your parents_,--you are in\r\npossession of the secret that corrodes their consciences, make your own\r\nuse of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Judge the effect of these words on a temper naturally\r\nviolent,--words, too, uttered by one whom I was taught to regard as the\r\nagent of the Divinity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this time, as I have since been informed, he was debating in his\r\nown mind whether he would not adopt your part instead of mine, or at\r\nleast vacillate between both, so as to augment his influence over our\r\nparents, by the additional feature of suspicion. Whatever influenced his\r\ndetermination, the effect of his lessons on me may be easily calculated.\r\nI became restless, jealous, and vindictive;--insolent to my parents, and\r\nsuspicious of all around me. Before I was eleven years of age I reviled\r\nmy father for his partiality to you,--I insulted my mother with her\r\ncrime,--I tyrannized over the domestics,--I was the dread and the\r\ntorment of the whole household; and the wretch who had made me thus a\r\npremature demon, had outraged nature, and compelled me to trample on\r\nevery tie he should have taught me to hallow and cherish, consoled\r\nhimself with the thought that he was obeying the calls of his function,\r\nand strengthening the hands of the church.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cScire volunt secreta domus et inde timeri.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the day preceding our first meeting, (which had not been intended\r\nbefore), the Director went to my father; he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSenhor, I think it\r\nbest the brothers should meet. Perhaps God may touch their hearts, and\r\nby his merciful influence over them, enable you to reverse the decree\r\nthat threatens one of them with seclusion, and both with a cruel and\r\nfinal separation.\xe2\x80\x9d My father assented with tears of delight. Those tears\r\ndid not melt the heart of the Director; he hastened to my apartment, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMy child, summon all your resolution, your artful, cruel, partial\r\nparents, are _preparing a scene_ for you,--they are determined on\r\nintroducing you to your spurious brother.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI will spurn him before\r\ntheir faces, if they dare to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with the pride of premature\r\ntyranny. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, my child, that will not do, you must appear to comply with\r\ntheir wishes, but you must not be their victim,--promise me that, my\r\ndear child,--promise me resolution and dissimulation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI promise you\r\nresolution, keep the dissimulation for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will do so,\r\nsince your interests require it.\xe2\x80\x9d He hurried back to my father. \xe2\x80\x9cSenhor,\r\nI have employed all the eloquence of heaven and nature with your younger\r\nson. He is softened,--he melts already,--he longs to precipitate himself\r\ninto the fraternal embrace, and hear your benediction poured over the\r\nunited hearts and bodies of your two children,--they are both your\r\nchildren. You must banish all prejudices, and----\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI have no\r\nprejudices!\xe2\x80\x9d said my poor father; \xe2\x80\x9clet me but see my children embrace,\r\nand if Heaven summoned me at that moment, I should obey it by dying of\r\njoy.\xe2\x80\x9d--The Director reproved him for the expressions which gushed from\r\nhis heart, and, wholly unmoved by them, hurried back to me, full of his\r\ncommission. \xe2\x80\x9cMy child, I have warned you of the conspiracy formed\r\nagainst you by your own family. You will receive a proof of it\r\nto-morrow,--your brother is to be introduced,--you will be required to\r\nembrace him,--your consent is reckoned on, but at the moment you do so,\r\nyour father is resolved to interpret this as the signal, on your part,\r\nof the resignation of all your natural rights. Comply with your\r\nhypocritical parents, embrace this brother, but give an air of\r\nrepugnance to the action that will justify your conscience, while it\r\ndeceives those who would deceive you. Watch the signal-word, my dear\r\nchild; embrace him as you would a serpent,--his art is not less, and his\r\npoison as deadly. Remember that your resolution will decide the event of\r\nthis meeting. Assume the appearance of affection, but remember you hold\r\nyour deadliest enemy in your arms.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words, unnatural as I was,\r\nI shuddered. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Director, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nis the enemy of God,--an illegitimate impostor. Now, my child, are you\r\nprepared?\xe2\x80\x9d and I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI am prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d That night, however, I was\r\nvery restless. I required the Director to be summoned. I said in my\r\npride, \xe2\x80\x9cBut how is this poor wretch (meaning you) to be disposed of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him embrace the monastic life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Director. At these words I\r\nfelt an interest on your account I had never recognized before. I said\r\ndecidedly, for he had taught me to assume a tone of decision, \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall\r\nnever be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d The Director appeared staggered, yet he trembled\r\nbefore the spirit he had himself raised. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him go into the army,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9clet him inlist as a common soldier, I can supply him with the\r\nmeans of promotion;--let him engage in the meanest profession, I shall\r\nnot blush to acknowledge him, but, father, he shall never be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear child, on what foundation does this extraordinary\r\nobjection rest? It is the only means to restore peace to the family, and\r\nprocure it for the unfortunate being for whom you are so much\r\ninterested.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, have done with this language. Promise me, as\r\nthe condition of my obedience to your wishes to-morrow, that my brother\r\nshall never be compelled to be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCompelled, my dear child! there\r\ncan be no compulsion in a holy vocation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am not certain of that; but\r\nI demand from you the promise I have mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d The Director hesitated,\r\nat last he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI promise.\xe2\x80\x9d And he hastened to tell my father there\r\nwas no longer any opposition to our meeting, and that I was delighted\r\nwith the determination which had been announced to me of my brother\r\neagerly embracing the monastic life. Thus was our first meeting\r\narranged. When, at the command of my father, our arms were entwined, I\r\nswear to you, my brother, I felt them thrill with affection. But the\r\ninstinct of nature was soon superseded by the force of habit, and I\r\nrecoiled, collected all the forces of nature and passion in the terrible\r\nexpression that I dared to direct towards our parents, while the\r\nDirector stood behind them smiling, and encouraging me by gestures. I\r\nthought I had acted my part with applause, at least I gave myself\r\nenough, and retired from the scene with as proud a step as if I had\r\ntrampled on a prostrate world,--I had only trampled on nature and my own\r\nheart. A few days after I was sent to a convent. The Director was\r\nalarmed at the dogmatizing tone he himself had taught me to assume, and\r\nhe urged the necessity of my education being attended to. My parents\r\ncomplied with every thing he required. I, for a wonder, consented; but,\r\nas the carriage conveyed me to the convent, I repeated to the Director,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, my brother is not to be a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c(After these lines several were unintelligible to me, apparently from\r\nthe agitation under which they were written;--the precipitancy and fiery\r\nardor of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s character communicated itself to his writings.\r\nAfter many a defaced page I could trace the following words.) * * * * *\r\n*\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was singular enough that you, who were the object of my inveterate\r\nhatred before my residence in the convent, became the object of my\r\ninterest from that moment. I had adopted your cause from pride, I now\r\nupheld it from experience. Compassion, instinct, whatever it was, began\r\nto assume the character of a duty. When I saw the indignity with which\r\nthe lower classes were treated, I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he shall never\r\nsuffer that,--he is my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d When I succeeded in my exercises, and\r\nwas applauded, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is applause in which he never can share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhen I was punished, and that was much more frequently, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nshall never feel this mortification.\xe2\x80\x9d My imagination expanded. I\r\nbelieved myself your future patron, I conceived myself redeeming the\r\ninjustice of nature, aiding and aggrandizing you, forcing you to confess\r\nthat you owed more to me than to your parents, and throwing myself, with\r\na disarmed and naked heart, on your gratitude alone for affection. I\r\nheard you call me brother,--I bid you stop, and call me benefactor. My\r\nnature, proud, generous, and fiery, had not yet quite emancipated itself\r\nfrom the influence of the Director, but every effort it made pointed, by\r\nan indescribable impulse, towards you. Perhaps the secret of this is to\r\nbe found in the elements of my character, which always struggled against\r\ndictation, and loved to teach itself all it wished to know, and inspire\r\nitself with the object of its own attachments. It is certain that I\r\nwished for your friendship, at the moment I was instructed to hate you.\r\nYour mild eyes and affectionate looks haunted me perpetually in the\r\nconvent. To the professions of friendship repeatedly made me by the\r\nboarders, I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI want a brother.\xe2\x80\x9d My conduct was eccentric and\r\nviolent,--no wonder, for my conscience had begun to operate against my\r\nhabits. Sometimes I would apply with an eagerness that made them tremble\r\nfor my health; at others, no punishment, however severe, could make me\r\nsubmit to the ordinary discipline of the house. The community grew weary\r\nof my obstinacy, violence, and irregularities. They wrote to the\r\nDirector to have me removed, but before this could be accomplished I was\r\nseized with a fever. They paid me unremitting attention, but there was\r\nsomething on my mind no cares of theirs could remove. When they brought\r\nme medicine with the most scrupulous punctuality, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet my\r\nbrother fetch it, and if it be poison I will drink it from his hand; I\r\nhave injured him much.\xe2\x80\x9d When the bell tolled for matins and vespers, I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cAre they going to make my brother a monk? The Director promised\r\nme differently, but you are all deceivers.\xe2\x80\x9d At length they muffled the\r\nbell. I heard its stifled sound, and I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are tolling for\r\nhis funeral, but I,--I am his murderer!\xe2\x80\x9d The community became terrified\r\nat these exclamations so often repeated, and with the meaning of which\r\nthey could not accuse themselves. I was removed in a state of delirium\r\nto my father\xe2\x80\x99s palace in Madrid. A figure like yours sat beside me in\r\nthe carriage, alighted when we stopped, accompanied me where I remained,\r\nassisted me when I was placed again in the carriage. So vivid was the\r\nimpression, that I was accustomed to say to the attendants, \xe2\x80\x9cStop, my\r\nbrother is assisting me.\xe2\x80\x9d When they asked me in the morning how I had\r\nrested? I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well,--Alonzo has been all night at my\r\nbed-side.\xe2\x80\x9d I invited this visionary companion to continue his\r\nattentions; and when the pillows were arranged to my satisfaction, I\r\nwould say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow kind my brother is,--how useful,--but _why will he not\r\nspeak_?\xe2\x80\x9d At one stage I absolutely refused nourishment, because the\r\nphantom appeared to decline it. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo not urge me, my brother, you\r\nsee, will not accept of it. Oh, I entreat his pardon, it is a day of\r\nabstinence,--that is his reason, you see how he points to his\r\nhabit,--that is enough.\xe2\x80\x9d It is very singular that the food at this house\r\nhappened to be poisoned, and that two of my attendants died of partaking\r\nof it before they could reach Madrid. I mention these circumstances,\r\nmerely to prove the rivetted hold you had taken both of my imagination\r\nand my affections. On the recovery of my intellect, my first inquiry was\r\nfor you. This had been foreseen, and my father and mother, shunning the\r\ndiscussion, and even trembling for the event, as they knew the violence\r\nof my temper, intrusted the whole business to the Director. He undertook\r\nit,--how he executed it is yet to be seen. On our first meeting he\r\napproached me with congratulations on my convalescence, with regrets for\r\nthe constraints I must have suffered in the convent, with assurances\r\nthat my parents would make my home a paradise. When he had gone on for\r\nsome time, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done with my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in the\r\nbosom of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Director, crossing himself. I understood him in\r\na moment,--I rushed past him before he had finished. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you\r\ngoing, my son?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo my parents.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYour parents,--it is impossible that\r\nyou can see them now.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is certain that I will see them. Dictate\r\nto me no longer,--degrade yourself not by this prostituted humiliation,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor he was putting himself in a posture of intreaty,--\xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ see my\r\nparents. Procure for me an introduction to them this moment, or tremble\r\nfor the continuance of your influence in the family.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words he\r\ntrembled. He did not indeed dread my influence, but he dreaded my\r\npassions. His own lessons were bitterly retaliated on him that moment.\r\nHe had made me fierce and impetuous, because that suited his purpose,\r\nbut he had neither calculated on, or prepared himself for, this\r\nextraordinary direction which my feelings had taken, so opposite to that\r\nwhich he had laboured to give them. He thought, in exciting my passions,\r\nhe could ascertain their direction. Woe be to those, who, in teaching\r\nthe elephant to direct his trunk against their foes, forget that by a\r\nsudden convolution of that trunk, he may rend the driver from his back,\r\nand trample him under his feet into the mire. Such was the Director\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsituation and mine, I insisted on going instantly to my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence. He interposed, he supplicated; at last, as a hopeless\r\nresource, he reminded me of his continual indulgence, his flattery of my\r\npassions. My answer was brief, but Oh that it might sink into the souls\r\nof such tutors and such priests! \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that has made me what I am. Lead\r\nthe way to my father\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, or I will spurn you before me to the\r\ndoor of it.\xe2\x80\x9d At this threat, which he saw I was able to execute, (for\r\nyou know my frame is athletic, and my stature twice that of his), he\r\ntrembled; and I confess this indication of both physical and mental\r\ndebility completed my contempt for him. He crawled before me to the\r\napartment where my father and mother were seated, in a balcony that\r\noverlooked the garden. They had imagined all was settled, and were\r\nastonished to see me rush in, followed by the Director, with an aspect\r\nthat left them no reason to hope for an auspicious result of our\r\nconference. The Director gave them a sign which I did not observe, and\r\nwhich they had not time to profit by,--and as I stood before them livid\r\nfrom my fever, on fire with passion, and trembling with inarticulate\r\nexpressions, they shuddered. Some looks of reproach were levelled by\r\nthem at the Director, which he returned, as usual, by signs. I did not\r\nunderstand _them_, but I made them understand me in a moment. I said to\r\nmy father, \xe2\x80\x9cSenhor, is it true you have made my brother a monk?\xe2\x80\x9d My\r\nfather hesitated; at last he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought the Director had been\r\ncommissioned to speak to you on that subject.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFather, what has a\r\nDirector to do in the concerns of a parent and child? That man never can\r\nbe a parent,--never can have a child, how then can he be a judge in a\r\ncase like this?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget yourself,--you forget the respect due to a\r\nminister of the church.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, I am but just raised from a\r\ndeath-bed, my mother and you trembled for my life,--that life still\r\ndepends on your words. I promised submission to this wretch, on a\r\ncondition which he has violated, which--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCommand yourself, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nmy father, in a tone of authority which ill suited the trembling lips it\r\nissued from, \xe2\x80\x9cor quit the apartment.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSenhor,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Director,\r\nin a softened tone, \xe2\x80\x9clet not me be the cause of dissension in a family\r\nwhose happiness and honour have been always my object, next to the\r\ninterests of the church. Let him go on, the remembrance of my crucified\r\nMaster will sustain me under his insults,\xe2\x80\x9d and he crossed himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretch!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, grasping his habit, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a hypocrite, a\r\ndeceiver!\xe2\x80\x9d and I know not of what violence I might have been guilty, but\r\nmy father interposed. My mother shrieked with terror, and a scene of\r\nconfusion followed, in which I recollect nothing but the hypocritical\r\nexclamations of the Director, appearing to struggle between my father\r\nand me, while he mediated with God for both. He repeated incessantly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSenhor, do not interpose, every indignity I suffer I make a sacrifice\r\nto Heaven; it will qualify me to be an intercessor for my traducer with\r\nGod;\xe2\x80\x9d and, crossing himself, he called on the most sacred names, and\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cLet insults, calumnies, and blows, be added to that\r\npreponderance of merit which is already weighed in the scales of heaven\r\nagainst my offences,\xe2\x80\x9d and he dared to mix the claims of the intercession\r\nof the saints, the purity of the immaculate Virgin, and even the blood\r\nand agony of Jesus Christ, with the vile submissions of his own\r\nhypocrisy. The room was by this time filled with attendants. My mother\r\nwas conveyed away, still shrieking with terror. My father, who loved\r\nher, was driven by this spectacle, and by my outrageous conduct, to a\r\npitch of fury,--he drew his sword. I burst into a laugh, that froze his\r\nblood as he approached me. I expanded my arms, and presented my breast,\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cStrike!--this is the consummation of monastic power,--it\r\nbegun by violating nature, and ends in filicide. Strike! give a glorious\r\ntriumph to the influence of the church, and add to the merits of the\r\nholy Director. You have sacrificed your Esau, your first-born, already,\r\nlet Jacob be your next victim.\xe2\x80\x9d My father retreated from me, and,\r\nrevolted by the disfigurement which the violence of my agitation had\r\ncaused, almost to convulsion, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cDemon!\xe2\x80\x9d and stood at a\r\ndistance viewing, and shuddering at me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who has made me so? _He_\r\nwho fostered my evil passions for his own purposes; and, because one\r\ngenerous impulse breaks out on the side of nature, would represent or\r\ndrive me mad, to effectuate his purposes. My father, I see the whole\r\npower and system of nature reversed, by the arts of a corrupt\r\necclesiastic. By his means my brother has been imprisoned for life;--by\r\nhis means our birth has been made a curse to my mother and to you. What\r\nhave we had in the family since his influence was fatally established in\r\nit, but dissension and misery? Your sword was pointed against my heart\r\nthis moment; was it nature or a monk that armed a parent against his\r\nchild, whose crime was--interceding for his brother? Dismiss this man,\r\nwhose presence eclipses our hearts, and let us confer together for a\r\nmoment as father and son, and if I do not humiliate myself before you,\r\nspurn me for ever. My father, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake examine the difference\r\nbetween this man and me, as we stand before you. We are together at the\r\nbar of your heart, judge between us. A dry and featureless image of\r\nselfish power, consecrated by the name of the church, occupies his whole\r\nsoul,--I plead to you by the interests of nature, that must be sincere,\r\nbecause they are contrary to my own. He only wishes to wither your\r\nsoul,--I seek to touch it. Is his heart in what he says? does he shed a\r\ntear? does he employ one impassioned expression? he calls on God,--while\r\nI call only on you. The very violence which you justly condemn, is not\r\nonly my vindication but my eulogy. They who prefer their cause to\r\nthemselves, need no proof of their advocacy being sincere.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\naggravate your crime, by laying it on another; you have always been\r\nviolent, obstinate, and rebellious.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut who has made me so? Ask\r\nhimself,--ask this shameful scene, in which his duplicity has driven me\r\nto act such a part.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to show submission, give me the first\r\nproof of it, by promising never to torture me by renewing the mention of\r\nthis subject. Your brother\xe2\x80\x99s fate is decided,--promise not to utter his\r\nname again, and----\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNever,--never,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cnever will I violate\r\nmy conscience by such a vow; and his who could propose it must be seared\r\nbeyond the power of Heaven to touch it.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet, in uttering these words, I\r\nknelt to my father, but he turned from me. I turned in despair to the\r\nDirector. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are the minister of Heaven, prove the truth of\r\nyour commission,--make peace in a distracted family, reconcile my father\r\nto both his children. You can effect this by a word, you know you can,\r\nyet you will not utter it. My unfortunate brother was not so inflexible\r\nto your appeals, and yet were they inspired by a feeling as justifiable\r\nas mine.\xe2\x80\x9d I had offended the Director beyond all forgiveness. I knew\r\nthis, and spoke indeed rather to expose than to persuade him. I did not\r\nexpect an answer from him, and I was not disappointed,--he did not utter\r\na word. I knelt in the middle of the floor between them. I cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeserted by my father and by you, I yet appeal to Heaven. I call on it\r\nto witness my vow never to abandon my persecuted brother, whom I have\r\nbeen made a tool to betray. I know you have power,--I defy it. I know\r\nevery art of circumvention, of imposture, of malignant industry,--every\r\nresource of earth and hell, will be set at work against me. I take\r\nHeaven to witness against you, and demand only its aid to insure my\r\nvictory.\xe2\x80\x9d My father had lost all patience; he desired the attendants to\r\nraise and remove me by force. This mention of force, so repugnant to my\r\nhabits of imperious indulgence, operated fatally on intellects scarcely\r\nrecovering from delirium, and too strongly tried in the late struggle. I\r\nrelapsed into partial insanity. I said wildly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, you know not\r\nhow mild, generous, and forgiving is the being you thus persecute,--I\r\nowe my life to him. _Ask your domestics if he did not attend me, step by\r\nstep, during my journey?_ If he did not administer my food, my\r\nmedicines, and smoothe the pillows on which I was supported?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nrave,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my father, as he heard this wild speech, but he cast a look\r\nof fearful inquiry on the attendants. The trembling servants swore, one\r\nand all, as well they might, that not a human being but themselves had\r\nbeen suffered to approach me since I quitted the convent, till my\r\narrival at Madrid. The small remains of reason forsook me completely at\r\nthis declaration, which was however true every word of it. I gave the\r\nlie to the last speaker with the utmost fury,--I struck those who were\r\nnext me. My father, astonished at my violence, suddenly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis mad.\xe2\x80\x9d The Director, who had till then been silent, instantly caught\r\nthe word, and repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is mad.\xe2\x80\x9d The servants, half in terror, half\r\nin conviction, re-echoed the cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was seized, dragged away; and this violence, which always excited\r\ncorresponding violence in me, realized all my father feared, and the\r\nDirector wished for. I behaved just as a boy, scarce out of a fever, and\r\nstill totally delirious, might be supposed to behave. In my apartment I\r\ntore down the hangings, and there was not a porcelain vase in the room\r\nthat I did not dash at their heads. When they seized me, I bit their\r\nhands; when at length they were compelled to bind me, I gnawed the\r\nstrings, and finally snapt them by a violent effort. In fact, I\r\ncompletely realized all the hopes of the Director. I was confined to my\r\napartment for several days. During this time, I recovered the only\r\npowers that usually revive in a state of isolation,--those of inflexible\r\nresolution and profound dissimulation. I had soon exercise enough for\r\nboth of them. On the twelfth day of my confinement, a servant appeared\r\nat the door of my apartment, and, bowing profoundly, announced, that if\r\nmy health was recovered, my father wished to see me. I bowed in complete\r\nimitation of his mechanical movements, and followed him with the steps\r\nof a statue. I found my father, armed with the Director at his side. He\r\nadvanced, and addressed me with an abruptness which proved that he\r\nforced himself to speak. He hurried over a few expressions of pleasure\r\nat my recovery, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you reflected on the subject of our\r\nlast conversation?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI have _reflected on it_.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9c_I had time to do\r\nso._\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have employed that time well?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cThen the\r\nresult will be favourable to the hopes of your family, and the interests\r\nof the church.\xe2\x80\x9d The last words chilled me a little, but I answered as I\r\nought. In a few moments after the Director joined me, He spoke amicably,\r\nand turned the conversation on neutral topics. I answered him,--what an\r\neffort did it cost me!--yet I answered him in all the bitterness of\r\nextorted politeness. All went on well, however. The family appeared\r\ngratified by my renovation. My father, harassed out, was content to\r\nprocure peace on any terms. My mother, still weaker, from the struggles\r\nbetween her conscience and the suggestions of the Director, wept, and\r\nsaid she was happy. A month has now elapsed in profound but treacherous\r\npeace on all sides. They think me subdued, but * * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, the efforts of the Director\xe2\x80\x99s power in the family would alone\r\nbe sufficient to precipitate my determinations. He has placed you in a\r\nconvent, but that is not enough for the persevering proselytism of the\r\nchurch. The palace of the Duke de Mon\xc3\xa7ada is, under his influence,\r\nturned into a convent itself. My mother is almost a nun, her whole life\r\nis exhausted in imploring forgiveness for a crime for which the\r\nDirector, to secure his own influence, orders her a new penance every\r\nhour. My father rushes from libertinism to austerity,--he vacillates\r\nbetween this world and the next;--in the bitterness of exasperated\r\nfeeling, sometimes reproaches my mother, and then joins her in the\r\nseverest penance. Must there not be something very wrong in the religion\r\nwhich thus substitutes external severities for internal amendment? I\r\nfeel I am of an inquiring spirit, and if I could obtain a book they call\r\nthe Bible, (which, though they say it contains the words of Jesus\r\nChrist, they never permit us to see) I think----but no matter. The very\r\ndomestics have assumed the _in ordine ad spiritualia_ character already.\r\nThey converse in whispers--they cross themselves when the clock\r\nstrikes--they dare to talk, even in my hearing, of the glory which will\r\nredound to God and the church, by the sacrifice my father may yet be\r\ninduced to make of his family to its interests.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy fever has abated--I have not lost a moment in consulting your\r\ninterests--I have heard that there is a possibility of your reclaiming\r\nyour vows--that is, as I have been told, of declaring they were extorted\r\nunder impressions of fraud and terror. Observe me, Alonzo, I would\r\nrather see you rot in a convent, than behold you stand forth as a living\r\nwitness of our mother\xe2\x80\x99s shame. But I am instructed that this reclamation\r\nof your vows may be carried on in a civil court: If this be practicable,\r\nyou may yet be free, and I shall be happy. Do not hesitate for\r\nresources, I am able to supply them. If you do not fail in resolution, I\r\nhave no doubt of our ultimate success.--_Ours_ I term it, for I shall\r\nnot know a moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace till you are emancipated. With the half of my\r\nyearly allowance I have bribed one of the domestics, who is brother to\r\nthe porter of the convent, to convey these lines to you. Answer me by\r\nthe same channel, it is secret and secure. You must, I understand,\r\nfurnish a memorial, to be put into the hands of an advocate. It must be\r\nstrongly worded,--but remember, not a word of our unfortunate mother;--I\r\nblush to say this to her son. Procure paper by some means. If you find\r\nany difficulty, I will furnish you; but, to avoid suspicion, and too\r\nfrequent recurrences to the porter, try to do it yourself. Your\r\nconventual duties will furnish you with a pretext of writing out your\r\nconfession,--I will undertake for its safe delivery. I commend you to\r\nthe holy keeping of God,--not the God of monks and directors, but the\r\nGod of nature and mercy.----I am your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\n    JUAN DI MON\xc3\x87ADA.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch were the contents of the papers which I received in fragments, and\r\nfrom time to time, by the hands of the porter. I swallowed the first the\r\nmoment I had read it, and the rest I found means to destroy unperceived\r\nas I received them,--my attendance on the infirmary entitling me to\r\ngreat indulgences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this part of the narrative, the Spaniard became so much agitated,\r\nthough apparently more from emotion than fatigue, that Melmoth intreated\r\nhim to suspend it for some days, and the exhausted narrator willingly\r\ncomplied.\r\n\r\nEND OF FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Transcriber\xe2\x80\x99s Note:\r\n\r\n    The following is a list of corrections made to the original.\r\n    The first line is the original line, the second the corrected one.\r\n\r\n  see any extravagance or waste in it \xe2\x80\x9cOh never, never, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  see any extravagance or waste in it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh never, never, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  congregation answersed,--\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he deserved his fate.\xe2\x80\x9d The murmurs of\r\n  congregation answered,--\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he deserved his fate.\xe2\x80\x9d The murmurs of\r\n\r\n  (2) Vide Pope, (copying from Doune).\r\n  (2) Vide Pope, (copying from Donne).\r\n\r\n  majesty could not posssibly have understood), and converted him and his\r\n  majesty could not possibly have understood), and converted him and his\r\n\r\n  Between the pages were cut most exquisitely in paper the liknesses of\r\n  Between the pages were cut most exquisitely in paper the likenesses of\r\n\r\n  Aphra Beha\xe2\x80\x99s plays, where the cavaliers are denominated the _heroicks_,\r\n  Aphra Behn\xe2\x80\x99s plays, where the cavaliers are denominated the _heroicks_,\r\n\r\n  smote Goliah.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
