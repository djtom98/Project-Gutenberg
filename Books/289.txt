THE RETURN OF ULYSSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nTHE RIVER BANK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning\r\nhis little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders\r\nand steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had\r\ndust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his\r\nblack fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the\r\nair above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his\r\ndark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and\r\nlonging. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his\r\nbrush on the floor, said \xe2\x80\x9cBother!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cO blow!\xe2\x80\x9d and also \xe2\x80\x9cHang\r\nspring-cleaning!\xe2\x80\x9d and bolted out of the house without even waiting to\r\nput on his coat. Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he\r\nmade for the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the\r\ngravelled carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer\r\nto the sun and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and\r\nscrooged and then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and\r\nscraped, working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp we go! Up we go!\xe2\x80\x9d till at last, pop! his snout came out into the\r\nsunlight, and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great\r\nmeadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is fine!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is better than whitewashing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated\r\nbrow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long\r\nthe carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a\r\nshout. Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and\r\nthe delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across\r\nthe meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold up!\xe2\x80\x9d said an elderly rabbit at the gap. \xe2\x80\x9cSixpence for the\r\nprivilege of passing by the private road!\xe2\x80\x9d He was bowled over in an\r\ninstant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the\r\nside of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly\r\nfrom their holes to see what the row was about. \xe2\x80\x9cOnion-sauce!\r\nOnion-sauce!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could\r\nthink of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started\r\ngrumbling at each other. \xe2\x80\x9cHow _stupid_ you are! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have reminded him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much too late,\r\nas is always the case.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the\r\nmeadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the copses,\r\nfinding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves\r\nthrusting\xe2\x80\x94everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead\r\nof having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering \xe2\x80\x9cwhitewash!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog\r\namong all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday is\r\nperhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other\r\nfellows busy working.\r\n\r\nHe thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly\r\nalong, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his\r\nlife had he seen a river before\xe2\x80\x94this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied\r\nanimal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and\r\nleaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that\r\nshook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake\r\nand a-shiver\xe2\x80\x94glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter\r\nand bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side\r\nof the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a\r\nman who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at\r\nlast, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a\r\nbabbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the\r\nheart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.\r\n\r\nAs he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the\r\nbank opposite, just above the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, caught his eye, and\r\ndreamily he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it\r\nwould make for an animal with few wants and fond of a bijou riverside\r\nresidence, above flood level and remote from noise and dust. As he\r\ngazed, something bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart\r\nof it, vanished, then twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could\r\nhardly be a star in such an unlikely situation; and it was too\r\nglittering and small for a glow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at\r\nhim, and so declared itself to be an eye; and a small face began\r\ngradually to grow up round it, like a frame round a picture.\r\n\r\nA brown little face, with whiskers.\r\n\r\nA grave round face, with the same twinkle in its eye that had first\r\nattracted his notice.\r\n\r\nSmall neat ears and thick silky hair.\r\n\r\nIt was the Water Rat!\r\n\r\nThen the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Mole!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water Rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Rat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to come over?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired the Rat presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, its all very well to _talk_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, rather pettishly, he\r\nbeing new to a river and riverside life and its ways.\r\n\r\nThe Rat said nothing, but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled on\r\nit; then lightly stepped into a little boat which the Mole had not\r\nobserved. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just\r\nthe size for two animals; and the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s whole heart went out to it at\r\nonce, even though he did not yet fully understand its uses.\r\n\r\nThe Rat sculled smartly across and made fast. Then he held up his\r\nforepaw as the Mole stepped gingerly down. \xe2\x80\x9cLean on that!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, step lively!\xe2\x80\x9d and the Mole to his surprise and rapture found\r\nhimself actually seated in the stern of a real boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis has been a wonderful day!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as the Rat shoved off and\r\ntook to the sculls again. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in a boat\r\nbefore in all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat, open-mouthed: \xe2\x80\x9cNever been in a\xe2\x80\x94you never\xe2\x80\x94well\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94what have you been doing, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so nice as all that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole shyly, though he was quite\r\nprepared to believe it as he leant back in his seat and surveyed the\r\ncushions, the oars, the rowlocks, and all the fascinating fittings, and\r\nfelt the boat sway lightly under him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice? It\xe2\x80\x99s the _only_ thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water Rat solemnly, as he leant\r\nforward for his stroke. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, my young friend, there is\r\n_nothing_\xe2\x80\x94absolute nothing\xe2\x80\x94half so much worth doing as simply messing\r\nabout in boats. Simply messing,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on dreamily:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmessing\xe2\x80\x94about\xe2\x80\x94in\xe2\x80\x94boats; messing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook ahead, Rat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Mole suddenly.\r\n\r\nIt was too late. The boat struck the bank full tilt. The dreamer, the\r\njoyous oarsman, lay on his back at the bottom of the boat, his heels in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94about in boats\xe2\x80\x94or _with_ boats,\xe2\x80\x9d the Rat went on composedly, picking\r\nhimself up with a pleasant laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIn or out of \xe2\x80\x99em, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\r\nNothing seems really to matter, that\xe2\x80\x99s the charm of it. Whether you get\r\naway, or whether you don\xe2\x80\x99t; whether you arrive at your destination or\r\nwhether you reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at\r\nall, you\xe2\x80\x99re always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it there\xe2\x80\x99s always something else to do, and you can do\r\nit if you like, but you\xe2\x80\x99d much better not. Look here! If you\xe2\x80\x99ve really\r\nnothing else on hand this morning, supposing we drop down the river\r\ntogether, and have a long day of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness, spread his chest with a\r\nsigh of full contentment, and leaned back blissfully into the soft\r\ncushions. \xe2\x80\x9c_What_ a day I\xe2\x80\x99m having!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us start at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold hard a minute, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. He looped the painter through\r\na ring in his landing-stage, climbed up into his hole above, and after\r\na short interval reappeared staggering under a fat, wicker\r\nluncheon-basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShove that under your feet,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed to the Mole, as he passed it\r\ndown into the boat. Then he untied the painter and took the sculls\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s inside it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole, wriggling with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s cold chicken inside it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat briefly; \xe2\x80\x9c\r\ncoldtonguecoldhamcoldbeefpickledgherkinssaladfrenchrollscresssandwiches\r\npottedme atgingerbeerlemonadesodawater\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO stop, stop,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Mole in ecstacies: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is too much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired the Rat seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only what I\r\nalways take on these little excursions; and the other animals are\r\nalways telling me that I\xe2\x80\x99m a mean beast and cut it _very_ fine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole never heard a word he was saying. Absorbed in the new life he\r\nwas entering upon, intoxicated with the sparkle, the ripple, the scents\r\nand the sounds and the sunlight, he trailed a paw in the water and\r\ndreamed long waking dreams. The Water Rat, like the good little fellow\r\nhe was, sculled steadily on and forebore to disturb him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your clothes awfully, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked after some half an\r\nhour or so had passed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get a black velvet smoking-suit\r\nmyself some day, as soon as I can afford it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, pulling himself together with an\r\neffort. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must think me very rude; but all this is so new to me.\r\nSo\xe2\x80\x94this\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94River!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The_ River,\xe2\x80\x9d corrected the Rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you really live by the river? What a jolly life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy it and with it and on it and in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s brother\r\nand sister to me, and aunts, and company, and food and drink, and\r\n(naturally) washing. It\xe2\x80\x99s my world, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any other. What it\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t got is not worth having, and what it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know is not worth\r\nknowing. Lord! the times we\xe2\x80\x99ve had together! Whether in winter or\r\nsummer, spring or autumn, it\xe2\x80\x99s always got its fun and its excitements.\r\nWhen the floods are on in February, and my cellars and basement are\r\nbrimming with drink that\xe2\x80\x99s no good to me, and the brown water runs by\r\nmy best bedroom window; or again when it all drops away and, shows\r\npatches of mud that smells like plum-cake, and the rushes and weed clog\r\nthe channels, and I can potter about dry shod over most of the bed of\r\nit and find fresh food to eat, and things careless people have dropped\r\nout of boats!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a bit dull at times?\xe2\x80\x9d the Mole ventured to ask. \xe2\x80\x9cJust you\r\nand the river, and no one else to pass a word with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one else to\xe2\x80\x94well, I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard on you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat with\r\nforbearance. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re new to it, and of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The bank\r\nis so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether: O\r\nno, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t what it used to be, at all. Otters, kingfishers,\r\ndabchicks, moorhens, all of them about all day long and always wanting\r\nyou to _do_ something\xe2\x80\x94as if a fellow had no business of his own to\r\nattend to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat lies over _there?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole, waving a paw towards a\r\nbackground of woodland that darkly framed the water-meadows on one side\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat? O, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the Wild Wood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo there very much, we river-bankers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t they\xe2\x80\x94aren\xe2\x80\x99t they very _nice_ people in there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, a\r\ntrifle nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW-e-ll,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat, \xe2\x80\x9clet me see. The squirrels are all right.\r\n_And_ the rabbits\xe2\x80\x94some of \xe2\x80\x99em, but rabbits are a mixed lot. And then\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s Badger, of course. He lives right in the heart of it; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlive anywhere else, either, if you paid him to do it. Dear old Badger!\r\nNobody interferes with _him_. They\xe2\x80\x99d better not,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, who _should_ interfere with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x94are others,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the Rat in a hesitating\r\nsort of way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeasels\xe2\x80\x94and stoats\xe2\x80\x94and foxes\xe2\x80\x94and so on. They\xe2\x80\x99re all right in a way\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nvery good friends with them\xe2\x80\x94pass the time of day when we meet, and all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94but they break out sometimes, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying it, and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94well, you can\xe2\x80\x99t really trust them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole knew well that it is quite against animal-etiquette to dwell\r\non possible trouble ahead, or even to allude to it; so he dropped the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd beyond the Wild Wood again?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere it\xe2\x80\x99s all blue and\r\ndim, and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they mayn\xe2\x80\x99t, and\r\nsomething like the smoke of towns, or is it only cloud-drift?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, either to you or me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been\r\nthere, and I\xe2\x80\x99m never going, nor you either, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got any sense at\r\nall. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here\xe2\x80\x99s our\r\nbackwater at last, where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first\r\nsight like a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either\r\nedge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet\r\nwater, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a\r\nweir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in\r\nits turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing\r\nmurmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices\r\nspeaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful\r\nthat the Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, \xe2\x80\x9cO my! O my! O\r\nmy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the\r\nstill awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket.\r\nThe Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself;\r\nand the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full\r\nlength on the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the\r\ntable-cloth and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by\r\none and arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, \xe2\x80\x9cO my! O\r\nmy!\xe2\x80\x9d at each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\npitch in, old fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for\r\nhe had started his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning,\r\nas people _will_ do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had\r\nbeen through a very great deal since that distant time which now seemed\r\nso many days ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat presently, when the edge of\r\ntheir hunger was somewhat dulled, and the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were able to\r\nwander off the table-cloth a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am looking,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, \xe2\x80\x9cat a streak of bubbles that I see\r\ntravelling along the surface of the water. That is a thing that strikes\r\nme as funny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBubbles? Oho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, and chirruped cheerily in an inviting\r\nsort of way.\r\n\r\nA broad glistening muzzle showed itself above the edge of the bank, and\r\nthe Otter hauled himself out and shook the water from his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreedy beggars!\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, making for the provender. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou invite me, Ratty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was an impromptu affair,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nfriend Mr. Mole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Otter, and the two animals were friends\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a rumpus everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Otter. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the world seems\r\nout on the river to-day. I came up this backwater to try and get a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s peace, and then stumble upon you fellows!\xe2\x80\x94At least\xe2\x80\x94I beg\r\npardon\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly mean that, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a rustle behind them, proceeding from a hedge wherein last\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s leaves still clung thick, and a stripy head, with high shoulders\r\nbehind it, peered forth on them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, old Badger!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Rat.\r\n\r\nThe Badger trotted forward a pace or two; then grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! Company,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand turned his back and disappeared from view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s _just_ the sort of fellow he is!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the disappointed\r\nRat. \xe2\x80\x9cSimply hates Society! Now we shan\xe2\x80\x99t see any more of him to-day.\r\nWell, tell us, _who\xe2\x80\x99s_ out on the river?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad\xe2\x80\x99s out, for one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Otter. \xe2\x80\x9cIn his brand-new wager-boat;\r\nnew togs, new everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two animals looked at each other and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce, it was nothing but sailing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, \xe2\x80\x9cThen he tired of\r\nthat and took to punting. Nothing would please him but to punt all day\r\nand every day, and a nice mess he made of it. Last year it was\r\nhouse-boating, and we all had to go and stay with him in his\r\nhouse-boat, and pretend we liked it. He was going to spend the rest of\r\nhis life in a house-boat. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same, whatever he takes up; he\r\ngets tired of it, and starts on something fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a good fellow, too,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Otter reflectively: \xe2\x80\x9cBut no\r\nstability\xe2\x80\x94especially in a boat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom where they sat they could get a glimpse of the main stream across\r\nthe island that separated them; and just then a wager-boat flashed into\r\nview, the rower\xe2\x80\x94a short, stout figure\xe2\x80\x94splashing badly and rolling a\r\ngood deal, but working his hardest. The Rat stood up and hailed him,\r\nbut Toad\xe2\x80\x94for it was he\xe2\x80\x94shook his head and settled sternly to his work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be out of the boat in a minute if he rolls like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nRat, sitting down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he will,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the Otter. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I ever tell you that good\r\nstory about Toad and the lock-keeper? It happened this way. Toad....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn errant May-fly swerved unsteadily athwart the current in the\r\nintoxicated fashion affected by young bloods of May-flies seeing life.\r\nA swirl of water and a \xe2\x80\x9ccloop!\xe2\x80\x9d and the May-fly was visible no more.\r\n\r\nNeither was the Otter.\r\n\r\nThe Mole looked down. The voice was still in his ears, but the turf\r\nwhereon he had sprawled was clearly vacant. Not an Otter to be seen, as\r\nfar as the distant horizon.\r\n\r\nBut again there was a streak of bubbles on the surface of the river.\r\n\r\nThe Rat hummed a tune, and the Mole recollected that animal-etiquette\r\nforbade any sort of comment on the sudden disappearance of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends at any moment, for any reason or no reason whatever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we ought to be moving. I wonder\r\nwhich of us had better pack the luncheon-basket?\xe2\x80\x9d He did not speak as\r\nif he was frightfully eager for the treat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, please let me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole. So, of course, the Rat let him.\r\n\r\nPacking the basket was not quite such pleasant work as unpacking the\r\nbasket. It never is. But the Mole was bent on enjoying everything, and\r\nalthough just when he had got the basket packed and strapped up tightly\r\nhe saw a plate staring up at him from the grass, and when the job had\r\nbeen done again the Rat pointed out a fork which anybody ought to have\r\nseen, and last of all, behold! the mustard pot, which he had been\r\nsitting on without knowing it\xe2\x80\x94still, somehow, the thing got finished at\r\nlast, without much loss of temper.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sun was getting low as the Rat sculled gently homewards\r\nin a dreamy mood, murmuring poetry-things over to himself, and not\r\npaying much attention to Mole. But the Mole was very full of lunch, and\r\nself-satisfaction, and pride, and already quite at home in a boat (so\r\nhe thought) and was getting a bit restless besides: and presently he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cRatty! Please, _I_ want to row, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat shook his head with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwait till you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a few lessons. It\xe2\x80\x99s not so easy as it\r\nlooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole was quiet for a minute or two. But he began to feel more and\r\nmore jealous of Rat, sculling so strongly and so easily along, and his\r\npride began to whisper that he could do it every bit as well. He jumped\r\nup and seized the sculls, so suddenly, that the Rat, who was gazing out\r\nover the water and saying more poetry-things to himself, was taken by\r\nsurprise and fell backwards off his seat with his legs in the air for\r\nthe second time, while the triumphant Mole took his place and grabbed\r\nthe sculls with entire confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop it, you _silly_ ass!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat, from the bottom of the boat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t do it! You\xe2\x80\x99ll have us over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole flung his sculls back with a flourish, and made a great dig at\r\nthe water. He missed the surface altogether, his legs flew up above his\r\nhead, and he found himself lying on the top of the prostrate Rat.\r\nGreatly alarmed, he made a grab at the side of the boat, and the next\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94Sploosh!\r\n\r\nOver went the boat, and he found himself struggling in the river.\r\n\r\nO my, how cold the water was, and O, how _very_ wet it felt. How it\r\nsang in his ears as he went down, down, down! How bright and welcome\r\nthe sun looked as he rose to the surface coughing and spluttering! How\r\nblack was his despair when he felt himself sinking again! Then a firm\r\npaw gripped him by the back of his neck. It was the Rat, and he was\r\nevidently laughing\xe2\x80\x94the Mole could _feel_ him laughing, right down his\r\narm and through his paw, and so into his\xe2\x80\x94the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94neck.\r\n\r\nThe Rat got hold of a scull and shoved it under the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s arm; then he\r\ndid the same by the other side of him and, swimming behind, propelled\r\nthe helpless animal to shore, hauled him out, and set him down on the\r\nbank, a squashy, pulpy lump of misery.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rat had rubbed him down a bit, and wrung some of the wet out\r\nof him, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, old fellow! Trot up and down the\r\ntowing-path as hard as you can, till you\xe2\x80\x99re warm and dry again, while I\r\ndive for the luncheon-basket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the dismal Mole, wet without and ashamed within, trotted about till\r\nhe was fairly dry, while the Rat plunged into the water again,\r\nrecovered the boat, righted her and made her fast, fetched his floating\r\nproperty to shore by degrees, and finally dived successfully for the\r\nluncheon-basket and struggled to land with it.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready for a start once more, the Mole, limp and dejected,\r\ntook his seat in the stern of the boat; and as they set off, he said in\r\na low voice, broken with emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cRatty, my generous friend! I am very\r\nsorry indeed for my foolish and ungrateful conduct. My heart quite\r\nfails me when I think how I might have lost that beautiful\r\nluncheon-basket. Indeed, I have been a complete ass, and I know it.\r\nWill you overlook it this once and forgive me, and let things go on as\r\nbefore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d responded the Rat cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle wet to a Water Rat? I\xe2\x80\x99m more in the water than out of it most\r\ndays. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think any more about it; and, look here! I really think\r\nyou had better come and stop with me for a little time. It\xe2\x80\x99s very plain\r\nand rough, you know\xe2\x80\x94not like Toad\xe2\x80\x99s house at all\xe2\x80\x94but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen\r\nthat yet; still, I can make you comfortable. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to row,\r\nand to swim, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be as handy on the water as any of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole was so touched by his kind manner of speaking that he could\r\nfind no voice to answer him; and he had to brush away a tear or two\r\nwith the back of his paw. But the Rat kindly looked in another\r\ndirection, and presently the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s spirits revived again, and he was\r\neven able to give some straight back-talk to a couple of moorhens who\r\nwere sniggering to each other about his bedraggled appearance.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour, and\r\nplanted the Mole in an arm-chair in front of it, having fetched down a\r\ndressing-gown and slippers for him, and told him river stories till\r\nsupper-time. Very thrilling stories they were, too, to an\r\nearth-dwelling animal like Mole. Stories about weirs, and sudden\r\nfloods, and leaping pike, and steamers that flung hard bottles\xe2\x80\x94at least\r\nbottles were certainly flung, and _from_ steamers, so presumably _by_\r\nthem; and about herons, and how particular they were whom they spoke\r\nto; and about adventures down drains, and night-fishings with Otter, or\r\nexcursions far a-field with Badger. Supper was a most cheerful meal;\r\nbut very shortly afterwards a terribly sleepy Mole had to be escorted\r\nupstairs by his considerate host, to the best bedroom, where he soon\r\nlaid his head on his pillow in great peace and contentment, knowing\r\nthat his new-found friend the River was lapping the sill of his window.\r\n\r\nThis day was only the first of many similar ones for the emancipated\r\nMole, each of them longer and full of interest as the ripening summer\r\nmoved onward. He learnt to swim and to row, and entered into the joy of\r\nrunning water; and with his ear to the reed-stems he caught, at\r\nintervals, something of what the wind went whispering so constantly\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nTHE OPEN ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRatty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole suddenly, one bright summer morning, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nplease, I want to ask you a favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat was sitting on the river bank, singing a little song. He had\r\njust composed it himself, so he was very taken up with it, and would\r\nnot pay proper attention to Mole or anything else. Since early morning\r\nhe had been swimming in the river, in company with his friends the\r\nducks. And when the ducks stood on their heads suddenly, as ducks will,\r\nhe would dive down and tickle their necks, just under where their chins\r\nwould be if ducks had chins, till they were forced to come to the\r\nsurface again in a hurry, spluttering and angry and shaking their\r\nfeathers at him, for it is impossible to say quite _all_ you feel when\r\nyour head is under water. At last they implored him to go away and\r\nattend to his own affairs and leave them to mind theirs. So the Rat\r\nwent away, and sat on the river bank in the sun, and made up a song\r\nabout them, which he called\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDUCKS\xe2\x80\x99 DITTY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll along the backwater,\r\nThrough the rushes tall,\r\nDucks are a-dabbling,\r\nUp tails all!\r\nDucks\xe2\x80\x99 tails, drakes\xe2\x80\x99 tails,\r\nYellow feet a-quiver,\r\nYellow bills all out of sight\r\nBusy in the river!\r\n\r\nSlushy green undergrowth\r\nWhere the roach swim\xe2\x80\x94\r\nHere we keep our larder,\r\nCool and full and dim.\r\n\r\nEveryone for what he likes!\r\n_We_ like to be\r\nHeads down, tails up,\r\nDabbling free!\r\n\r\nHigh in the blue above\r\nSwifts whirl and call\xe2\x80\x94\r\n_We_ are down a-dabbling\r\nUptails all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I think so _very_ much of that little song, Rat,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved the Mole cautiously. He was no poet himself and didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nwho knew it; and he had a candid nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor don\xe2\x80\x99t the ducks neither,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Why_ can\xe2\x80\x99t fellows be allowed to do what they like _when_ they like\r\nand _as_ they like, instead of other fellows sitting on banks and\r\nwatching them all the time and making remarks and poetry and things\r\nabout them? What _nonsense_ it all is!\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the ducks say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is, so it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, with great heartiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Mole soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\r\nI wanted to ask you was, won\xe2\x80\x99t you take me to call on Mr. Toad? I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheard so much about him, and I do so want to make his acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good-natured Rat, jumping to his feet and\r\ndismissing poetry from his mind for the day. \xe2\x80\x9cGet the boat out, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll paddle up there at once. It\xe2\x80\x99s never the wrong time to call on\r\nToad. Early or late he\xe2\x80\x99s always the same fellow. Always good-tempered,\r\nalways glad to see you, always sorry when you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be a very nice animal,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Mole, as he got into the\r\nboat and took the sculls, while the Rat settled himself comfortably in\r\nthe stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is indeed the best of animals,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cSo simple, so\r\ngood-natured, and so affectionate. Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s not very clever\xe2\x80\x94we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t all be geniuses; and it may be that he is both boastful and\r\nconceited. But he has got some great qualities, has Toady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRounding a bend in the river, they came in sight of a handsome,\r\ndignified old house of mellowed red brick, with well-kept lawns\r\nreaching down to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Toad Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat; \xe2\x80\x9cand that creek on the left, where\r\nthe notice-board says, \xe2\x80\x98Private. No landing allowed,\xe2\x80\x99 leads to his\r\nboat-house, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the boat. The stables are over there to\r\nthe right. That\xe2\x80\x99s the banqueting-hall you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at now\xe2\x80\x94very old,\r\nthat is. Toad is rather rich, you know, and this is really one of the\r\nnicest houses in these parts, though we never admit as much to Toad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey glided up the creek, and the Mole shipped his sculls as they\r\npassed into the shadow of a large boat-house. Here they saw many\r\nhandsome boats, slung from the cross beams or hauled up on a slip, but\r\nnone in the water; and the place had an unused and a deserted air.\r\n\r\nThe Rat looked around him. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBoating is played\r\nout. He\xe2\x80\x99s tired of it, and done with it. I wonder what new fad he has\r\ntaken up now? Come along and let\xe2\x80\x99s look him up. We shall hear all about\r\nit quite soon enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey disembarked, and strolled across the gay flower-decked lawns in\r\nsearch of Toad, whom they presently happened upon resting in a wicker\r\ngarden-chair, with a pre-occupied expression of face, and a large map\r\nspread out on his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, jumping up on seeing them, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nshook the paws of both of them warmly, never waiting for an\r\nintroduction to the Mole. \xe2\x80\x9cHow _kind_ of you!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, dancing\r\nround them. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to send a boat down the river for you,\r\nRatty, with strict orders that you were to be fetched up here at once,\r\nwhatever you were doing. I want you badly\xe2\x80\x94both of you. Now what will\r\nyou take? Come inside and have something! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how lucky it\r\nis, your turning up just now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s sit quiet a bit, Toady!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, throwing himself into an\r\neasy chair, while the Mole took another by the side of him and made\r\nsome civil remark about Toad\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdelightful residence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinest house on the whole river,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toad boisterously. \xe2\x80\x9cOr\r\nanywhere else, for that matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he could not help adding.\r\n\r\nHere the Rat nudged the Mole. Unfortunately the Toad saw him do it, and\r\nturned very red. There was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s painful silence. Then Toad burst\r\nout laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Ratty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only my way, you know.\r\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not such a very bad house, is it? You know you rather like it\r\nyourself. Now, look here. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be sensible. You are the very animals I\r\nwanted. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to help me. It\xe2\x80\x99s most important!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about your rowing, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, with an innocent\r\nair. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting on fairly well, though you splash a good bit\r\nstill. With a great deal of patience, and any quantity of coaching, you\r\nmay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, pooh! boating!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Toad, in great disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly\r\nboyish amusement. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given that up _long_ ago. Sheer waste of time,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. It makes me downright sorry to see you fellows, who\r\nought to know better, spending all your energies in that aimless\r\nmanner. No, I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered the real thing, the only genuine occupation\r\nfor a life time. I propose to devote the remainder of mine to it, and\r\ncan only regret the wasted years that lie behind me, squandered in\r\ntrivialities. Come with me, dear Ratty, and your amiable friend also,\r\nif he will be so very good, just as far as the stable-yard, and you\r\nshall see what you shall see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the stable-yard accordingly, the Rat following with a\r\nmost mistrustful expression; and there, drawn out of the coach house\r\ninto the open, they saw a gipsy caravan, shining with newness, painted\r\na canary-yellow picked out with green, and red wheels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Toad, straddling and expanding himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s real life for you, embodied in that little cart. The open\r\nroad, the dusty highway, the heath, the common, the hedgerows, the\r\nrolling downs! Camps, villages, towns, cities! Here to-day, up and off\r\nto somewhere else to-morrow! Travel, change, interest, excitement! The\r\nwhole world before you, and a horizon that\xe2\x80\x99s always changing! And mind!\r\nthis is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built, without\r\nany exception. Come inside and look at the arrangements. Planned \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nall myself, I did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole was tremendously interested and excited, and followed him\r\neagerly up the steps and into the interior of the caravan. The Rat only\r\nsnorted and thrust his hands deep into his pockets, remaining where he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed very compact and comfortable. Little sleeping bunks\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle table that folded up against the wall\xe2\x80\x94a cooking-stove, lockers,\r\nbookshelves, a bird-cage with a bird in it; and pots, pans, jugs and\r\nkettles of every size and variety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll complete!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Toad triumphantly, pulling open a locker. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94biscuits, potted lobster, sardines\xe2\x80\x94everything you can possibly\r\nwant. Soda-water here\xe2\x80\x94baccy there\xe2\x80\x94letter-paper, bacon, jam, cards and\r\ndominoes\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll find,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as they descended the steps again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find that nothing what ever has been forgotten, when we make\r\nour start this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat slowly, as he chewed a straw, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\ndid I overhear you say something about \xe2\x80\x98_we_,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98_start_,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_this afternoon?_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you dear good old Ratty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, imploringly, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t begin\r\ntalking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way, because you know you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n_got_ to come. I can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly manage without you, so please consider\r\nit settled, and don\xe2\x80\x99t argue\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand. You\r\nsurely don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life,\r\nand just live in a hole in a bank, and _boat?_ I want to show you the\r\nworld! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make an _animal_ of you, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not coming, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflat. And I _am_ going to stick to my old river, _and_ live in a hole,\r\n_and_ boat, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve always done. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more, Mole\xe2\x80\x99s going to stick\r\nto me and do as I do, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, loyally. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll always stick to you,\r\nRat, and what you say is to be\xe2\x80\x94has got to be. All the same, it sounds\r\nas if it might have been\xe2\x80\x94well, rather fun, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nwistfully. Poor Mole! The Life Adventurous was so new a thing to him,\r\nand so thrilling; and this fresh aspect of it was so tempting; and he\r\nhad fallen in love at first sight with the canary-coloured cart and all\r\nits little fitments.\r\n\r\nThe Rat saw what was passing in his mind, and wavered. He hated\r\ndisappointing people, and he was fond of the Mole, and would do almost\r\nanything to oblige him. Toad was watching both of them closely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along in, and have some lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, diplomatically, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll talk it over. We needn\xe2\x80\x99t decide anything in a hurry. Of course,\r\n_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t really care. I only want to give pleasure to you fellows.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Live for others!\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s my motto in life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring luncheon\xe2\x80\x94which was excellent, of course, as everything at Toad\r\nHall always was\xe2\x80\x94the Toad simply let himself go. Disregarding the Rat,\r\nhe proceeded to play upon the inexperienced Mole as on a harp.\r\nNaturally a voluble animal, and always mastered by his imagination, he\r\npainted the prospects of the trip and the joys of the open life and the\r\nroadside in such glowing colours that the Mole could hardly sit in his\r\nchair for excitement. Somehow, it soon seemed taken for granted by all\r\nthree of them that the trip was a settled thing; and the Rat, though\r\nstill unconvinced in his mind, allowed his good-nature to over-ride his\r\npersonal objections. He could not bear to disappoint his two friends,\r\nwho were already deep in schemes and anticipations, planning out each\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s separate occupation for several weeks ahead.\r\n\r\nWhen they were quite ready, the now triumphant Toad led his companions\r\nto the paddock and set them to capture the old grey horse, who, without\r\nhaving been consulted, and to his own extreme annoyance, had been told\r\noff by Toad for the dustiest job in this dusty expedition. He frankly\r\npreferred the paddock, and took a deal of catching. Meantime Toad\r\npacked the lockers still tighter with necessaries, and hung nosebags,\r\nnets of onions, bundles of hay, and baskets from the bottom of the\r\ncart. At last the horse was caught and harnessed, and they set off, all\r\ntalking at once, each animal either trudging by the side of the cart or\r\nsitting on the shaft, as the humour took him. It was a golden\r\nafternoon. The smell of the dust they kicked up was rich and\r\nsatisfying; out of thick orchards on either side the road, birds called\r\nand whistled to them cheerily; good-natured wayfarers, passing them,\r\ngave them \xe2\x80\x9cGood-day,\xe2\x80\x9d or stopped to say nice things about their\r\nbeautiful cart; and rabbits, sitting at their front doors in the\r\nhedgerows, held up their fore-paws, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cO my! O my! O my!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLate in the evening, tired and happy and miles from home, they drew up\r\non a remote common far from habitations, turned the horse loose to\r\ngraze, and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass by the side of\r\nthe cart. Toad talked big about all he was going to do in the days to\r\ncome, while stars grew fuller and larger all around them, and a yellow\r\nmoon, appearing suddenly and silently from nowhere in particular, came\r\nto keep them company and listen to their talk. At last they turned in\r\nto their little bunks in the cart; and Toad, kicking out his legs,\r\nsleepily said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, good night, you fellows! This is the real life\r\nfor a gentleman! Talk about your old river!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ talk about my river,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the patient Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _know_ I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, Toad. But I _think_ about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added pathetically, in a lower\r\ntone: \xe2\x80\x9cI think about it\xe2\x80\x94all the time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole reached out from under his blanket, felt for the Rat\xe2\x80\x99s paw in\r\nthe darkness, and gave it a squeeze. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you like,\r\nRatty,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we run away to-morrow morning, quite\r\nearly\xe2\x80\x94_very_ early\xe2\x80\x94and go back to our dear old hole on the river?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see it out,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered back the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks awfully,\r\nbut I ought to stick by Toad till this trip is ended. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nsafe for him to be left to himself. It won\xe2\x80\x99t take very long. His fads\r\nnever do. Good night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe end was indeed nearer than even the Rat suspected.\r\n\r\nAfter so much open air and excitement the Toad slept very soundly, and\r\nno amount of shaking could rouse him out of bed next morning. So the\r\nMole and Rat turned to, quietly and manfully, and while the Rat saw to\r\nthe horse, and lit a fire, and cleaned last night\xe2\x80\x99s cups and platters,\r\nand got things ready for breakfast, the Mole trudged off to the nearest\r\nvillage, a long way off, for milk and eggs and various necessaries the\r\nToad had, of course, forgotten to provide. The hard work had all been\r\ndone, and the two animals were resting, thoroughly exhausted, by the\r\ntime Toad appeared on the scene, fresh and gay, remarking what a\r\npleasant easy life it was they were all leading now, after the cares\r\nand worries and fatigues of housekeeping at home.\r\n\r\nThey had a pleasant ramble that day over grassy downs and along narrow\r\nby-lanes, and camped as before, on a common, only this time the two\r\nguests took care that Toad should do his fair share of work. In\r\nconsequence, when the time came for starting next morning, Toad was by\r\nno means so rapturous about the simplicity of the primitive life, and\r\nindeed attempted to resume his place in his bunk, whence he was hauled\r\nby force. Their way lay, as before, across country by narrow lanes, and\r\nit was not till the afternoon that they came out on the high-road,\r\ntheir first high-road; and there disaster, fleet and unforeseen, sprang\r\nout on them\xe2\x80\x94disaster momentous indeed to their expedition, but simply\r\noverwhelming in its effect on the after-career of Toad.\r\n\r\nThey were strolling along the high-road easily, the Mole by the horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, talking to him, since the horse had complained that he was being\r\nfrightfully left out of it, and nobody considered him in the least; the\r\nToad and the Water Rat walking behind the cart talking together\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast Toad was talking, and Rat was saying at intervals, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nprecisely; and what did _you_ say to _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and thinking all the time\r\nof something very different, when far behind them they heard a faint\r\nwarning hum; like the drone of a distant bee. Glancing back, they saw a\r\nsmall cloud of dust, with a dark centre of energy, advancing on them at\r\nincredible speed, while from out the dust a faint \xe2\x80\x9cPoop-poop!\xe2\x80\x9d wailed\r\nlike an uneasy animal in pain. Hardly regarding it, they turned to\r\nresume their conversation, when in an instant (as it seemed) the\r\npeaceful scene was changed, and with a blast of wind and a whirl of\r\nsound that made them jump for the nearest ditch, It was on them! The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoop-poop\xe2\x80\x9d rang with a brazen shout in their ears, they had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglimpse of an interior of glittering plate-glass and rich morocco, and\r\nthe magnificent motor-car, immense, breath-snatching, passionate, with\r\nits pilot tense and hugging his wheel, possessed all earth and air for\r\nthe fraction of a second, flung an enveloping cloud of dust that\r\nblinded and enwrapped them utterly, and then dwindled to a speck in the\r\nfar distance, changed back into a droning bee once more.\r\n\r\nThe old grey horse, dreaming, as he plodded along, of his quiet\r\npaddock, in a new raw situation such as this simply abandoned himself\r\nto his natural emotions. Rearing, plunging, backing steadily, in spite\r\nof all the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s efforts at his head, and all the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s lively\r\nlanguage directed at his better feelings, he drove the cart backwards\r\ntowards the deep ditch at the side of the road. It wavered an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x94then there was a heartrending crash\xe2\x80\x94and the canary-coloured\r\ncart, their pride and their joy, lay on its side in the ditch, an\r\nirredeemable wreck.\r\n\r\nThe Rat danced up and down in the road, simply transported with\r\npassion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou villains!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, shaking both fists, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nscoundrels, you highwaymen, you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94roadhogs!\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the law of you!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll report you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you through all the Courts!\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nhome-sickness had quite slipped away from him, and for the moment he\r\nwas the skipper of the canary-coloured vessel driven on a shoal by the\r\nreckless jockeying of rival mariners, and he was trying to recollect\r\nall the fine and biting things he used to say to masters of\r\nsteam-launches when their wash, as they drove too near the bank, used\r\nto flood his parlour-carpet at home.\r\n\r\nToad sat straight down in the middle of the dusty road, his legs\r\nstretched out before him, and stared fixedly in the direction of the\r\ndisappearing motor-car. He breathed short, his face wore a placid\r\nsatisfied expression, and at intervals he faintly murmured \xe2\x80\x9cPoop-poop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole was busy trying to quiet the horse, which he succeeded in\r\ndoing after a time. Then he went to look at the cart, on its side in\r\nthe ditch. It was indeed a sorry sight. Panels and windows smashed,\r\naxles hopelessly bent, one wheel off, sardine-tins scattered over the\r\nwide world, and the bird in the bird-cage sobbing pitifully and calling\r\nto be let out.\r\n\r\nThe Rat came to help him, but their united efforts were not sufficient\r\nto right the cart. \xe2\x80\x9cHi! Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and bear a hand, can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Toad never answered a word, or budged from his seat in the road; so\r\nthey went to see what was the matter with him. They found him in a sort\r\nof a trance, a happy smile on his face, his eyes still fixed on the\r\ndusty wake of their destroyer. At intervals he was still heard to\r\nmurmur \xe2\x80\x9cPoop-poop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat shook him by the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you coming to help us, Toad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe demanded sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlorious, stirring sight!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Toad, never offering to move. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\npoetry of motion! The _real_ way to travel! The _only_ way to travel!\r\nHere to-day\xe2\x80\x94in next week to-morrow! Villages skipped, towns and cities\r\njumped\xe2\x80\x94always somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s horizon! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my! O\r\nmy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO _stop_ being an ass, Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Mole despairingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think I never _knew!_\xe2\x80\x9d went on the Toad in a dreamy monotone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll those wasted years that lie behind me, I never knew, never even\r\n_dreamt!_ But _now_\xe2\x80\x94but now that I know, now that I fully realise! O\r\nwhat a flowery track lies spread before me, henceforth! What\r\ndust-clouds shall spring up behind me as I speed on my reckless way!\r\nWhat carts I shall fling carelessly into the ditch in the wake of my\r\nmagnificent onset! Horrid little carts\xe2\x80\x94common carts\xe2\x80\x94canary-coloured\r\ncarts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to do with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole of the Water Rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause there is really\r\nnothing to be done. You see, I know him from of old. He is now\r\npossessed. He has got a new craze, and it always takes him that way, in\r\nits first stage. He\xe2\x80\x99ll continue like that for days now, like an animal\r\nwalking in a happy dream, quite useless for all practical purposes.\r\nNever mind him. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go and see what there is to be done about the\r\ncart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA careful inspection showed them that, even if they succeeded in\r\nrighting it by themselves, the cart would travel no longer. The axles\r\nwere in a hopeless state, and the missing wheel was shattered into\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe Rat knotted the horse\xe2\x80\x99s reins over his back and took him by the\r\nhead, carrying the bird cage and its hysterical occupant in the other\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d he said grimly to the Mole. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s five or six miles to\r\nthe nearest town, and we shall just have to walk it. The sooner we make\r\na start the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about Toad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole anxiously, as they set off\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t leave him here, sitting in the middle of the road\r\nby himself, in the distracted state he\xe2\x80\x99s in! It\xe2\x80\x99s not safe. Supposing\r\nanother Thing were to come along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, _bother_ Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat savagely; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded very far on their way, however, when there was a\r\npattering of feet behind them, and Toad caught them up and thrust a paw\r\ninside the elbow of each of them; still breathing short and staring\r\ninto vacancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look here, Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat sharply: \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as we get to the\r\ntown, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go straight to the police-station, and see if they\r\nknow anything about that motor-car and who it belongs to, and lodge a\r\ncomplaint against it. And then you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go to a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s or a\r\nwheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s and arrange for the cart to be fetched and mended and put\r\nto rights. It\xe2\x80\x99ll take time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite a hopeless smash.\r\nMeanwhile, the Mole and I will go to an inn and find comfortable rooms\r\nwhere we can stay till the cart\xe2\x80\x99s ready, and till your nerves have\r\nrecovered their shock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolice-station! Complaint!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Toad dreamily. \xe2\x80\x9cMe _complain_ of\r\nthat beautiful, that heavenly vision that has been vouchsafed me!\r\n_Mend_ the _cart!_ I\xe2\x80\x99ve done with carts for ever. I never want to see\r\nthe cart, or to hear of it, again. O, Ratty! You can\xe2\x80\x99t think how\r\nobliged I am to you for consenting to come on this trip! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave gone without you, and then I might never have seen that\xe2\x80\x94that swan,\r\nthat sunbeam, that thunderbolt! I might never have heard that\r\nentrancing sound, or smelt that bewitching smell! I owe it all to you,\r\nmy best of friends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat turned from him in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nthe Mole, addressing him across Toad\xe2\x80\x99s head: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s quite hopeless. I\r\ngive it up\xe2\x80\x94when we get to the town we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the railway station, and\r\nwith luck we may pick up a train there that\xe2\x80\x99ll get us back to riverbank\r\nto-night. And if ever you catch me going a-pleasuring with this\r\nprovoking animal again!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94He snorted, and during the rest of that weary\r\ntrudge addressed his remarks exclusively to Mole.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the town they went straight to the station and deposited\r\nToad in the second-class waiting-room, giving a porter twopence to keep\r\na strict eye on him. They then left the horse at an inn stable, and\r\ngave what directions they could about the cart and its contents.\r\nEventually, a slow train having landed them at a station not very far\r\nfrom Toad Hall, they escorted the spell-bound, sleep-walking Toad to\r\nhis door, put him inside it, and instructed his housekeeper to feed\r\nhim, undress him, and put him to bed. Then they got out their boat from\r\nthe boat-house, sculled down the river home, and at a very late hour\r\nsat down to supper in their own cosy riverside parlour, to the Rat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat joy and contentment.\r\n\r\nThe following evening the Mole, who had risen late and taken things\r\nvery easy all day, was sitting on the bank fishing, when the Rat, who\r\nhad been looking up his friends and gossiping, came strolling along to\r\nfind him. \xe2\x80\x9cHeard the news?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else being talked\r\nabout, all along the river bank. Toad went up to Town by an early train\r\nthis morning. And he has ordered a large and very expensive motor-car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nTHE WILD WOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the Badger. He\r\nseemed, by all accounts, to be such an important personage and, though\r\nrarely visible, to make his unseen influence felt by everybody about\r\nthe place. But whenever the Mole mentioned his wish to the Water Rat he\r\nalways found himself put off. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d the Rat would say.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBadger\xe2\x80\x99ll turn up some day or other\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s always turning up\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce you. The best of fellows! But you must not only take him\r\n_as_ you find him, but _when_ you find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask him here dinner or something?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat simply. \xe2\x80\x9cBadger hates Society, and\r\ninvitations, and dinner, and all that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, supposing we go and call on _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that at _all_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, quite\r\nalarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s so very shy, he\xe2\x80\x99d be sure to be offended. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\neven ventured to call on him at his own home myself, though I know him\r\nso well. Besides, we can\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite out of the question, because he\r\nlives in the very middle of the Wild Wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, supposing he does,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole. \xe2\x80\x9cYou told me the Wild Wood\r\nwas all right, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I know, I know, so it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat evasively. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think\r\nwe won\xe2\x80\x99t go there just now. Not _just_ yet. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long way, and he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at home at this time of year anyhow, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming\r\nalong some day, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll wait quietly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole had to be content with this. But the Badger never came along,\r\nand every day brought its amusements, and it was not till summer was\r\nlong over, and cold and frost and miry ways kept them much indoors, and\r\nthe swollen river raced past outside their windows with a speed that\r\nmocked at boating of any sort or kind, that he found his thoughts\r\ndwelling again with much persistence on the solitary grey Badger, who\r\nlived his own life by himself, in his hole in the middle of the Wild\r\nWood.\r\n\r\nIn the winter time the Rat slept a great deal, retiring early and\r\nrising late. During his short day he sometimes scribbled poetry or did\r\nother small domestic jobs about the house; and, of course, there were\r\nalways animals dropping in for a chat, and consequently there was a\r\ngood deal of story-telling and comparing notes on the past summer and\r\nall its doings.\r\n\r\nSuch a rich chapter it had been, when one came to look back on it all!\r\nWith illustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured! The pageant\r\nof the river bank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in\r\nscene-pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession. Purple\r\nloosestrife arrived early, shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the\r\nedge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it. Willow-herb,\r\ntender and wistful, like a pink sunset cloud, was not slow to follow.\r\nComfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white, crept forth to take\r\nits place in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and\r\ndelaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if\r\nstring-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a\r\ngavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was\r\nstill awaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for\r\nwhom the ladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the\r\nsleeping summer back to life and love. But when meadow-sweet, debonair\r\nand odorous in amber jerkin, moved graciously to his place in the\r\ngroup, then the play was ready to begin.\r\n\r\nAnd what a play it had been! Drowsy animals, snug in their holes while\r\nwind and rain were battering at their doors, recalled still keen\r\nmornings, an hour before sunrise, when the white mist, as yet\r\nundispersed, clung closely along the surface of the water; then the\r\nshock of the early plunge, the scamper along the bank, and the radiant\r\ntransformation of earth, air, and water, when suddenly the sun was with\r\nthem again, and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the\r\nearth once more. They recalled the languorous siesta of hot mid-day,\r\ndeep in green undergrowth, the sun striking through in tiny golden\r\nshafts and spots; the boating and bathing of the afternoon, the rambles\r\nalong dusty lanes and through yellow cornfields; and the long, cool\r\nevening at last, when so many threads were gathered up, so many\r\nfriendships rounded, and so many adventures planned for the morrow.\r\nThere was plenty to talk about on those short winter days when the\r\nanimals found themselves round the fire; still, the Mole had a good\r\ndeal of spare time on his hands, and so one afternoon, when the Rat in\r\nhis arm-chair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over\r\nrhymes that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fit, he formed the resolution to go out by himself\r\nand explore the Wild Wood, and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with\r\nMr. Badger.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead, when he\r\nslipped out of the warm parlour into the open air. The country lay bare\r\nand entirely leafless around him, and he thought that he had never seen\r\nso far and so intimately into the insides of things as on that winter\r\nday when Nature was deep in her annual slumber and seemed to have\r\nkicked the clothes off. Copses, dells, quarries and all hidden places,\r\nwhich had been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer, now\r\nexposed themselves and their secrets pathetically, and seemed to ask\r\nhim to overlook their shabby poverty for a while, till they could riot\r\nin rich masquerade as before, and trick and entice him with the old\r\ndeceptions. It was pitiful in a way, and yet cheering\xe2\x80\x94even\r\nexhilarating. He was glad that he liked the country undecorated, hard,\r\nand stripped of its finery. He had got down to the bare bones of it,\r\nand they were fine and strong and simple. He did not want the warm\r\nclover and the play of seeding grasses; the screens of quickset, the\r\nbillowy drapery of beech and elm seemed best away; and with great\r\ncheerfulness of spirit he pushed on towards the Wild Wood, which lay\r\nbefore him low and threatening, like a black reef in some still\r\nsouthern sea.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to alarm him at first entry. Twigs crackled under his\r\nfeet, logs tripped him, funguses on stumps resembled caricatures, and\r\nstartled him for the moment by their likeness to something familiar and\r\nfar away; but that was all fun, and exciting. It led him on, and he\r\npenetrated to where the light was less, and trees crouched nearer and\r\nnearer, and holes made ugly mouths at him on either side.\r\n\r\nEverything was very still now. The dusk advanced on him steadily,\r\nrapidly, gathering in behind and before; and the light seemed to be\r\ndraining away like flood-water.\r\n\r\nThen the faces began.\r\n\r\nIt was over his shoulder, and indistinctly, that he first thought he\r\nsaw a face; a little evil wedge-shaped face, looking out at him from a\r\nhole. When he turned and confronted it, the thing had vanished.\r\n\r\nHe quickened his pace, telling himself cheerfully not to begin\r\nimagining things, or there would be simply no end to it. He passed\r\nanother hole, and another, and another; and then\xe2\x80\x94yes!\xe2\x80\x94no!\xe2\x80\x94yes!\r\ncertainly a little narrow face, with hard eyes, had flashed up for an\r\ninstant from a hole, and was gone. He hesitated\xe2\x80\x94braced himself up for\r\nan effort and strode on. Then suddenly, and as if it had been so all\r\nthe time, every hole, far and near, and there were hundreds of them,\r\nseemed to possess its face, coming and going rapidly, all fixing on him\r\nglances of malice and hatred: all hard-eyed and evil and sharp.\r\n\r\nIf he could only get away from the holes in the banks, he thought,\r\nthere would be no more faces. He swung off the path and plunged into\r\nthe untrodden places of the wood.\r\n\r\nThen the whistling began.\r\n\r\nVery faint and shrill it was, and far behind him, when first he heard\r\nit; but somehow it made him hurry forward. Then, still very faint and\r\nshrill, it sounded far ahead of him, and made him hesitate and want to\r\ngo back. As he halted in indecision it broke out on either side, and\r\nseemed to be caught up and passed on throughout the whole length of the\r\nwood to its farthest limit. They were up and alert and ready,\r\nevidently, whoever they were! And he\xe2\x80\x94he was alone, and unarmed, and far\r\nfrom any help; and the night was closing in.\r\n\r\nThen the pattering began.\r\n\r\nHe thought it was only falling leaves at first, so slight and delicate\r\nwas the sound of it. Then as it grew it took a regular rhythm, and he\r\nknew it for nothing else but the pat-pat-pat of little feet still a\r\nvery long way off. Was it in front or behind? It seemed to be first\r\none, and then the other, then both. It grew and it multiplied, till\r\nfrom every quarter as he listened anxiously, leaning this way and that,\r\nit seemed to be closing in on him. As he stood still to hearken, a\r\nrabbit came running hard towards him through the trees. He waited,\r\nexpecting it to slacken pace, or to swerve from him into a different\r\ncourse. Instead, the animal almost brushed him as it dashed past, his\r\nface set and hard, his eyes staring. \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of this, you fool, get\r\nout!\xe2\x80\x9d the Mole heard him mutter as he swung round a stump and\r\ndisappeared down a friendly burrow.\r\n\r\nThe pattering increased till it sounded like sudden hail on the dry\r\nleaf-carpet spread around him. The whole wood seemed running now,\r\nrunning hard, hunting, chasing, closing in round something or\xe2\x80\x94somebody?\r\nIn panic, he began to run too, aimlessly, he knew not whither. He ran\r\nup against things, he fell over things and into things, he darted under\r\nthings and dodged round things. At last he took refuge in the deep dark\r\nhollow of an old beech tree, which offered shelter, concealment\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\neven safety, but who could tell? Anyhow, he was too tired to run any\r\nfurther, and could only snuggle down into the dry leaves which had\r\ndrifted into the hollow and hope he was safe for a time. And as he lay\r\nthere panting and trembling, and listened to the whistlings and the\r\npatterings outside, he knew it at last, in all its fullness, that dread\r\nthing which other little dwellers in field and hedgerow had encountered\r\nhere, and known as their darkest moment\xe2\x80\x94that thing which the Rat had\r\nvainly tried to shield him from\xe2\x80\x94the Terror of the Wild Wood!\r\n\r\nMeantime the Rat, warm and comfortable, dozed by his fireside. His\r\npaper of half-finished verses slipped from his knee, his head fell\r\nback, his mouth opened, and he wandered by the verdant banks of\r\ndream-rivers. Then a coal slipped, the fire crackled and sent up a\r\nspurt of flame, and he woke with a start. Remembering what he had been\r\nengaged upon, he reached down to the floor for his verses, pored over\r\nthem for a minute, and then looked round for the Mole to ask him if he\r\nknew a good rhyme for something or other.\r\n\r\nBut the Mole was not there.\r\n\r\nHe listened for a time. The house seemed very quiet.\r\n\r\nThen he called \xe2\x80\x9cMoly!\xe2\x80\x9d several times, and, receiving no answer, got up\r\nand went out into the hall.\r\n\r\nThe Mole\xe2\x80\x99s cap was missing from its accustomed peg. His goloshes, which\r\nalways lay by the umbrella-stand, were also gone.\r\n\r\nThe Rat left the house, and carefully examined the muddy surface of the\r\nground outside, hoping to find the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s tracks. There they were, sure\r\nenough. The goloshes were new, just bought for the winter, and the\r\npimples on their soles were fresh and sharp. He could see the imprints\r\nof them in the mud, running along straight and purposeful, leading\r\ndirect to the Wild Wood.\r\n\r\nThe Rat looked very grave, and stood in deep thought for a minute or\r\ntwo. Then he re-entered the house, strapped a belt round his waist,\r\nshoved a brace of pistols into it, took up a stout cudgel that stood in\r\na corner of the hall, and set off for the Wild Wood at a smart pace.\r\n\r\nIt was already getting towards dusk when he reached the first fringe of\r\ntrees and plunged without hesitation into the wood, looking anxiously\r\non either side for any sign of his friend. Here and there wicked little\r\nfaces popped out of holes, but vanished immediately at sight of the\r\nvalorous animal, his pistols, and the great ugly cudgel in his grasp;\r\nand the whistling and pattering, which he had heard quite plainly on\r\nhis first entry, died away and ceased, and all was very still. He made\r\nhis way manfully through the length of the wood, to its furthest edge;\r\nthen, forsaking all paths, he set himself to traverse it, laboriously\r\nworking over the whole ground, and all the time calling out cheerfully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoly, Moly, Moly! Where are you? It\xe2\x80\x99s me\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s old Rat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had patiently hunted through the wood for an hour or more, when at\r\nlast to his joy he heard a little answering cry. Guiding himself by the\r\nsound, he made his way through the gathering darkness to the foot of an\r\nold beech tree, with a hole in it, and from out of the hole came a\r\nfeeble voice, saying \xe2\x80\x9cRatty! Is that really you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat crept into the hollow, and there he found the Mole, exhausted\r\nand still trembling. \xe2\x80\x9cO Rat!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been so frightened, you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I quite understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\nhave gone and done it, Mole. I did my best to keep you from it. We\r\nriver-bankers, we hardly ever come here by ourselves. If we have to\r\ncome, we come in couples, at least; then we\xe2\x80\x99re generally all right.\r\nBesides, there are a hundred things one has to know, which we\r\nunderstand all about and you don\xe2\x80\x99t, as yet. I mean passwords, and\r\nsigns, and sayings which have power and effect, and plants you carry in\r\nyour pocket, and verses you repeat, and dodges and tricks you practise;\r\nall simple enough when you know them, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be known if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re small, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll find yourself in trouble. Of course if you were\r\nBadger or Otter, it would be quite another matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely the brave Mr. Toad wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind coming here by himself, would\r\nhe?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Toad?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, laughing heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t show his face\r\nhere alone, not for a whole hatful of golden guineas, Toad wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole was greatly cheered by the sound of the Rat\xe2\x80\x99s careless\r\nlaughter, as well as by the sight of his stick and his gleaming\r\npistols, and he stopped shivering and began to feel bolder and more\r\nhimself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat presently, \xe2\x80\x9cwe really must pull ourselves\r\ntogether and make a start for home while there\xe2\x80\x99s still a little light\r\nleft. It will never do to spend the night here, you understand. Too\r\ncold, for one thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Ratty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor Mole, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dreadfully sorry, but I\xe2\x80\x99m simply\r\ndead beat and that\xe2\x80\x99s a solid fact. You _must_ let me rest here a while\r\nlonger, and get my strength back, if I\xe2\x80\x99m to get home at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good-natured Rat, \xe2\x80\x9crest away. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\r\nnearly pitch dark now, anyhow; and there ought to be a bit of a moon\r\nlater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Mole got well into the dry leaves and stretched himself out, and\r\npresently dropped off into sleep, though of a broken and troubled sort;\r\nwhile the Rat covered himself up, too, as best he might, for warmth,\r\nand lay patiently waiting, with a pistol in his paw.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the Mole woke up, much refreshed and in his usual spirits,\r\nthe Rat said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then! I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a look outside and see if\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s quiet, and then we really must be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to the entrance of their retreat and put his head out. Then the\r\nMole heard him saying quietly to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHullo! hullo! here\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up, Ratty?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Snow_ is up,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat briefly; \xe2\x80\x9cor rather, _down_. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsnowing hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole came and crouched beside him, and, looking out, saw the wood\r\nthat had been so dreadful to him in quite a changed aspect. Holes,\r\nhollows, pools, pitfalls, and other black menaces to the wayfarer were\r\nvanishing fast, and a gleaming carpet of faery was springing up\r\neverywhere, that looked too delicate to be trodden upon by rough feet.\r\nA fine powder filled the air and caressed the cheek with a tingle in\r\nits touch, and the black boles of the trees showed up in a light that\r\nseemed to come from below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, after pondering. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmust make a start, and take our chance, I suppose. The worst of it is,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know where we are. And now this snow makes everything\r\nlook so very different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt did indeed. The Mole would not have known that it was the same wood.\r\nHowever, they set out bravely, and took the line that seemed most\r\npromising, holding on to each other and pretending with invincible\r\ncheerfulness that they recognized an old friend in every fresh tree\r\nthat grimly and silently greeted them, or saw openings, gaps, or paths\r\nwith a familiar turn in them, in the monotony of white space and black\r\ntree-trunks that refused to vary.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two later\xe2\x80\x94they had lost all count of time\xe2\x80\x94they pulled up,\r\ndispirited, weary, and hopelessly at sea, and sat down on a fallen\r\ntree-trunk to recover their breath and consider what was to be done.\r\nThey were aching with fatigue and bruised with tumbles; they had fallen\r\ninto several holes and got wet through; the snow was getting so deep\r\nthat they could hardly drag their little legs through it, and the trees\r\nwere thicker and more like each other than ever. There seemed to be no\r\nend to this wood, and no beginning, and no difference in it, and, worst\r\nof all, no way out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t sit here very long,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have to make\r\nanother push for it, and do something or other. The cold is too awful\r\nfor anything, and the snow will soon be too deep for us to wade\r\nthrough.\xe2\x80\x9d He peered about him and considered. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis is what occurs to me. There\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of dell down here in front\r\nof us, where the ground seems all hilly and humpy and hummocky. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake our way down into that, and try and find some sort of shelter, a\r\ncave or hole with a dry floor to it, out of the snow and the wind, and\r\nthere we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a good rest before we try again, for we\xe2\x80\x99re both of us\r\npretty dead beat. Besides, the snow may leave off, or something may\r\nturn up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo once more they got on their feet, and struggled down into the dell,\r\nwhere they hunted about for a cave or some corner that was dry and a\r\nprotection from the keen wind and the whirling snow. They were\r\ninvestigating one of the hummocky bits the Rat had spoken of, when\r\nsuddenly the Mole tripped up and fell forward on his face with a\r\nsqueal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO my leg!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cO my poor shin!\xe2\x80\x9d and he sat up on the snow and\r\nnursed his leg in both his front paws.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Mole!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be having much luck to-day, do you? Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a\r\nlook at the leg. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, going down on his knees to look,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve cut your shin, sure enough. Wait till I get at my handkerchief,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tie it up for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have tripped over a hidden branch or a stump,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole\r\nmiserably. \xe2\x80\x9cO, my! O, my!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very clean cut,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, examining it again attentively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was never done by a branch or a stump. Looks as if it was made by\r\na sharp edge of something in metal. Funny!\xe2\x80\x9d He pondered awhile, and\r\nexamined the humps and slopes that surrounded them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind what done it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, forgetting his grammar\r\nin his pain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts just the same, whatever done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his handkerchief,\r\nhad left him and was busy scraping in the snow. He scratched and\r\nshovelled and explored, all four legs working busily, while the Mole\r\nwaited impatiently, remarking at intervals, \xe2\x80\x9cO, _come_ on, Rat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Rat cried \xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray-oo-ray-oo-ray-oo-ray!\xe2\x80\x9d and fell to executing a feeble jig in\r\nthe snow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _have_ you found, Ratty?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole, still nursing his leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and see!\xe2\x80\x9d said the delighted Rat, as he jigged on.\r\n\r\nThe Mole hobbled up to the spot and had a good look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI SEE it right enough. Seen the same\r\nsort of thing before, lots of times. Familiar object, I call it. A\r\ndoor-scraper! Well, what of it? Why dance jigs around a door-scraper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what it _means_, you\xe2\x80\x94you dull-witted animal?\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe Rat impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I see what it means,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Mole. \xe2\x80\x9cIt simply means\r\nthat some VERY careless and forgetful person has left his door-scraper\r\nlying about in the middle of the Wild Wood, _just_ where it\xe2\x80\x99s _sure_ to\r\ntrip _everybody_ up. Very thoughtless of him, I call it. When I get\r\nhome I shall go and complain about it to\xe2\x80\x94to somebody or other, see if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dear! O, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat, in despair at his obtuseness. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\r\nstop arguing and come and scrape!\xe2\x80\x9d And he set to work again and made\r\nthe snow fly in all directions around him.\r\n\r\nAfter some further toil his efforts were rewarded, and a very shabby\r\ndoor-mat lay exposed to view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, what did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Rat in great triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely nothing whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Mole, with perfect\r\ntruthfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cWell now,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou seem to have found another\r\npiece of domestic litter, done for and thrown away, and I suppose\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly happy. Better go ahead and dance your jig round that\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to, and get it over, and then perhaps we can go on and\r\nnot waste any more time over rubbish-heaps. Can we EAT a doormat? or\r\nsleep under a door-mat? Or sit on a door-mat and sledge home over the\r\nsnow on it, you exasperating rodent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94mean\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the excited Rat, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this door-mat\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t _tell_ you anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Rat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, quite pettishly, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99d had enough\r\nof this folly. Who ever heard of a door-mat _telling_ anyone anything?\r\nThey simply don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. They are not that sort at all. Door-mats know\r\ntheir place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, you\xe2\x80\x94you thick-headed beast,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat, really\r\nangry, \xe2\x80\x9cthis must stop. Not another word, but scrape\xe2\x80\x94scrape and scratch\r\nand dig and hunt round, especially on the sides of the hummocks, if you\r\nwant to sleep dry and warm to-night, for it\xe2\x80\x99s our last chance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat attacked a snow-bank beside them with ardour, probing with his\r\ncudgel everywhere and then digging with fury; and the Mole scraped\r\nbusily too, more to oblige the Rat than for any other reason, for his\r\nopinion was that his friend was getting light-headed.\r\n\r\nSome ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 hard work, and the point of the Rat\xe2\x80\x99s cudgel struck\r\nsomething that sounded hollow. He worked till he could get a paw\r\nthrough and feel; then called the Mole to come and help him. Hard at it\r\nwent the two animals, till at last the result of their labours stood\r\nfull in view of the astonished and hitherto incredulous Mole.\r\n\r\nIn the side of what had seemed to be a snow-bank stood a solid-looking\r\nlittle door, painted a dark green. An iron bell-pull hung by the side,\r\nand below it, on a small brass plate, neatly engraved in square capital\r\nletters, they could read by the aid of moonlight\r\n\r\nMR. BADGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mole fell backwards on the snow from sheer surprise and delight.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRat!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in penitence, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a wonder! A real wonder, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat you are. I see it all now! You argued it out, step by step, in\r\nthat wise head of yours, from the very moment that I fell and cut my\r\nshin, and you looked at the cut, and at once your majestic mind said to\r\nitself, \xe2\x80\x98Door-scraper!\xe2\x80\x99 And then you turned to and found the very\r\ndoor-scraper that done it! Did you stop there? No. Some people would\r\nhave been quite satisfied; but not you. Your intellect went on working.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me only just find a door-mat,\xe2\x80\x99 says you to yourself, \xe2\x80\x98and my\r\ntheory is proved!\xe2\x80\x99 And of course you found your door-mat. You\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nclever, I believe you could find anything you liked. \xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 says you,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that door exists, as plain as if I saw it. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else\r\nremains to be done but to find it!\xe2\x80\x99 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read about that sort of\r\nthing in books, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never come across it before in real life. You\r\nought to go where you\xe2\x80\x99ll be properly appreciated. You\xe2\x80\x99re simply wasted\r\nhere, among us fellows. If I only had your head, Ratty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as you haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Rat, rather unkindly, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to sit on the snow all night and _talk?_ Get up at once\r\nand hang on to that bell-pull you see there, and ring hard, as hard as\r\nyou can, while I hammer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the Rat attacked the door with his stick, the Mole sprang up at\r\nthe bell-pull, clutched it and swung there, both feet well off the\r\nground, and from quite a long way off they could faintly hear a\r\ndeep-toned bell respond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nMR. BADGER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY waited patiently for what seemed a very long time, stamping in the\r\nsnow to keep their feet warm. At last they heard the sound of slow\r\nshuffling footsteps approaching the door from the inside. It seemed, as\r\nthe Mole remarked to the Rat, like some one walking in carpet slippers\r\nthat were too large for him and down at heel; which was intelligent of\r\nMole, because that was exactly what it was.\r\n\r\nThere was the noise of a bolt shot back, and the door opened a few\r\ninches, enough to show a long snout and a pair of sleepy blinking eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the _very_ next time this happens,\xe2\x80\x9d said a gruff and suspicious\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be exceedingly angry. Who is it _this_ time, disturbing\r\npeople on such a night? Speak up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Badger,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat, \xe2\x80\x9clet us in, please. It\xe2\x80\x99s me, Rat, and my\r\nfriend Mole, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost our way in the snow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Ratty, my dear little man!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Badger, in quite a\r\ndifferent voice. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along in, both of you, at once. Why, you must be\r\nperished. Well I never! Lost in the snow! And in the Wild Wood, too,\r\nand at this time of night! But come in with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two animals tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get\r\ninside, and heard the door shut behind them with great joy and relief.\r\n\r\nThe Badger, who wore a long dressing-gown, and whose slippers were\r\nindeed very down at heel, carried a flat candlestick in his paw and had\r\nprobably been on his way to bed when their summons sounded. He looked\r\nkindly down on them and patted both their heads. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the sort\r\nof night for small animals to be out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said paternally. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been up to some of your pranks again, Ratty. But come along;\r\ncome into the kitchen. There\xe2\x80\x99s a first-rate fire there, and supper and\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shuffled on in front of them, carrying the light, and they followed\r\nhim, nudging each other in an anticipating sort of way, down a long,\r\ngloomy, and, to tell the truth, decidedly shabby passage, into a sort\r\nof a central hall; out of which they could dimly see other long\r\ntunnel-like passages branching, passages mysterious and without\r\napparent end. But there were doors in the hall as well\xe2\x80\x94stout oaken\r\ncomfortable-looking doors. One of these the Badger flung open, and at\r\nonce they found themselves in all the glow and warmth of a large\r\nfire-lit kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe floor was well-worn red brick, and on the wide hearth burnt a fire\r\nof logs, between two attractive chimney-corners tucked away in the\r\nwall, well out of any suspicion of draught. A couple of high-backed\r\nsettles, facing each other on either side of the fire, gave further\r\nsitting accommodations for the sociably disposed. In the middle of the\r\nroom stood a long table of plain boards placed on trestles, with\r\nbenches down each side. At one end of it, where an arm-chair stood\r\npushed back, were spread the remains of the Badger\xe2\x80\x99s plain but ample\r\nsupper. Rows of spotless plates winked from the shelves of the dresser\r\nat the far end of the room, and from the rafters overhead hung hams,\r\nbundles of dried herbs, nets of onions, and baskets of eggs. It seemed\r\na place where heroes could fitly feast after victory, where weary\r\nharvesters could line up in scores along the table and keep their\r\nHarvest Home with mirth and song, or where two or three friends of\r\nsimple tastes could sit about as they pleased and eat and smoke and\r\ntalk in comfort and contentment. The ruddy brick floor smiled up at the\r\nsmoky ceiling; the oaken settles, shiny with long wear, exchanged\r\ncheerful glances with each other; plates on the dresser grinned at pots\r\non the shelf, and the merry firelight flickered and played over\r\neverything without distinction.\r\n\r\nThe kindly Badger thrust them down on a settle to toast themselves at\r\nthe fire, and bade them remove their wet coats and boots. Then he\r\nfetched them dressing-gowns and slippers, and himself bathed the Mole\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshin with warm water and mended the cut with sticking-plaster till the\r\nwhole thing was just as good as new, if not better. In the embracing\r\nlight and warmth, warm and dry at last, with weary legs propped up in\r\nfront of them, and a suggestive clink of plates being arranged on the\r\ntable behind, it seemed to the storm-driven animals, now in safe\r\nanchorage, that the cold and trackless Wild Wood just left outside was\r\nmiles and miles away, and all that they had suffered in it a\r\nhalf-forgotten dream.\r\n\r\nWhen at last they were thoroughly toasted, the Badger summoned them to\r\nthe table, where he had been busy laying a repast. They had felt pretty\r\nhungry before, but when they actually saw at last the supper that was\r\nspread for them, really it seemed only a question of what they should\r\nattack first where all was so attractive, and whether the other things\r\nwould obligingly wait for them till they had time to give them\r\nattention. Conversation was impossible for a long time; and when it was\r\nslowly resumed, it was that regrettable sort of conversation that\r\nresults from talking with your mouth full. The Badger did not mind that\r\nsort of thing at all, nor did he take any notice of elbows on the\r\ntable, or everybody speaking at once. As he did not go into Society\r\nhimself, he had got an idea that these things belonged to the things\r\nthat didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter. (We know of course that he was wrong, and\r\ntook too narrow a view; because they do matter very much, though it\r\nwould take too long to explain why.) He sat in his arm-chair at the\r\nhead of the table, and nodded gravely at intervals as the animals told\r\ntheir story; and he did not seem surprised or shocked at anything, and\r\nhe never said, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cJust what I always said,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nremarked that they ought to have done so-and-so, or ought not to have\r\ndone something else. The Mole began to feel very friendly towards him.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was really finished at last, and each animal felt that his\r\nskin was now as tight as was decently safe, and that by this time he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care a hang for anybody or anything, they gathered round the\r\nglowing embers of the great wood fire, and thought how jolly it was to\r\nbe sitting up _so_ late, and _so_ independent, and _so_ full; and after\r\nthey had chatted for a time about things in general, the Badger said\r\nheartily, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then! tell us the news from your part of the world.\r\nHow\xe2\x80\x99s old Toad going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, from bad to worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat gravely, while the Mole, cocked\r\nup on a settle and basking in the firelight, his heels higher than his\r\nhead, tried to look properly mournful. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother smash-up only last\r\nweek, and a bad one. You see, he will insist on driving himself, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s hopelessly incapable. If he\xe2\x80\x99d only employ a decent, steady,\r\nwell-trained animal, pay him good wages, and leave everything to him,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d get on all right. But no; he\xe2\x80\x99s convinced he\xe2\x80\x99s a heaven-born\r\ndriver, and nobody can teach him anything; and all the rest follows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many has he had?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Badger gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmashes, or machines?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, after all, it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsame thing\xe2\x80\x94with Toad. This is the seventh. As for the others\xe2\x80\x94you know\r\nthat coach-house of his? Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s piled up\xe2\x80\x94literally piled up to the\r\nroof\xe2\x80\x94with fragments of motor-cars, none of them bigger than your hat!\r\nThat accounts for the other six\xe2\x80\x94so far as they can be accounted for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been in hospital three times,\xe2\x80\x9d put in the Mole; \xe2\x80\x9cand as for the\r\nfines he\xe2\x80\x99s had to pay, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply awful to think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cToad\xe2\x80\x99s rich,\r\nwe all know; but he\xe2\x80\x99s not a millionaire. And he\xe2\x80\x99s a hopelessly bad\r\ndriver, and quite regardless of law and order. Killed or ruined\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot to be one of the two things, sooner or later. Badger! we\xe2\x80\x99re his\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t we to do something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Badger went through a bit of hard thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cNow look here!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid at last, rather severely; \xe2\x80\x9cof course you know I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything\r\n_now?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis two friends assented, quite understanding his point. No animal,\r\naccording to the rules of animal-etiquette, is ever expected to do\r\nanything strenuous, or heroic, or even moderately active during the\r\noff-season of winter. All are sleepy\xe2\x80\x94some actually asleep. All are\r\nweather-bound, more or less; and all are resting from arduous days and\r\nnights, during which every muscle in them has been severely tested, and\r\nevery energy kept at full stretch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Badger. \xe2\x80\x9c_But_, when once the year has\r\nreally turned, and the nights are shorter, and halfway through them one\r\nrouses and feels fidgety and wanting to be up and doing by sunrise, if\r\nnot before\xe2\x80\x94_you_ know!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth animals nodded gravely. _They_ knew!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _then_,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the Badger, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x94that is, you and me and our\r\nfriend the Mole here\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll take Toad seriously in hand. We\xe2\x80\x99ll stand no\r\nnonsense whatever. We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him back to reason, by force if need be.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll _make_ him be a sensible Toad. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re asleep, Rat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, waking up with a jerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been asleep two or three times since supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole,\r\nlaughing. He himself was feeling quite wakeful and even lively, though\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why. The reason was, of course, that he being naturally\r\nan underground animal by birth and breeding, the situation of Badger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse exactly suited him and made him feel at home; while the Rat, who\r\nslept every night in a bedroom the windows of which opened on a breezy\r\nriver, naturally felt the atmosphere still and oppressive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s time we were all in bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, getting up and\r\nfetching flat candlesticks. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, you two, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you\r\nyour quarters. And take your time tomorrow morning\xe2\x80\x94breakfast at any\r\nhour you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe conducted the two animals to a long room that seemed half bedchamber\r\nand half loft. The Badger\xe2\x80\x99s winter stores, which indeed were visible\r\neverywhere, took up half the room\xe2\x80\x94piles of apples, turnips, and\r\npotatoes, baskets full of nuts, and jars of honey; but the two little\r\nwhite beds on the remainder of the floor looked soft and inviting, and\r\nthe linen on them, though coarse, was clean and smelt beautifully of\r\nlavender; and the Mole and the Water Rat, shaking off their garments in\r\nsome thirty seconds, tumbled in between the sheets in great joy and\r\ncontentment.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the kindly Badger\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions, the two tired\r\nanimals came down to breakfast very late next morning, and found a\r\nbright fire burning in the kitchen, and two young hedgehogs sitting on\r\na bench at the table, eating oatmeal porridge out of wooden bowls. The\r\nhedgehogs dropped their spoons, rose to their feet, and ducked their\r\nheads respectfully as the two entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, sit down, sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat pleasantly, \xe2\x80\x9cand go on with\r\nyour porridge. Where have you youngsters come from? Lost your way in\r\nthe snow, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder of the two hedgehogs respectfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe and little Billy here, we was trying to find our way to\r\nschool\xe2\x80\x94mother _would_ have us go, was the weather ever so\xe2\x80\x94and of course\r\nwe lost ourselves, sir, and Billy he got frightened and took and cried,\r\nbeing young and faint-hearted. And at last we happened up against Mr.\r\nBadger\xe2\x80\x99s back door, and made so bold as to knock, sir, for Mr. Badger\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a kind-hearted gentleman, as everyone knows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, cutting himself some rashers from a side\r\nof bacon, while the Mole dropped some eggs into a saucepan. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe weather like outside? You needn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98sir\xe2\x80\x99 me quite so much?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, terrible bad, sir, terrible deep the snow is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hedgehog.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo getting out for the likes of you gentlemen to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Badger?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Mole, as he warmed the coffee-pot\r\nbefore the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe master\xe2\x80\x99s gone into his study, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hedgehog, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\r\nsaid as how he was going to be particular busy this morning, and on no\r\naccount was he to be disturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis explanation, of course, was thoroughly understood by every one\r\npresent. The fact is, as already set forth, when you live a life of\r\nintense activity for six months in the year, and of comparative or\r\nactual somnolence for the other six, during the latter period you\r\ncannot be continually pleading sleepiness when there are people about\r\nor things to be done. The excuse gets monotonous. The animals well knew\r\nthat Badger, having eaten a hearty breakfast, had retired to his study\r\nand settled himself in an arm-chair with his legs up on another and a\r\nred cotton handkerchief over his face, and was being \xe2\x80\x9cbusy\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\nusual way at this time of the year.\r\n\r\nThe front-door bell clanged loudly, and the Rat, who was very greasy\r\nwith buttered toast, sent Billy, the smaller hedgehog, to see who it\r\nmight be. There was a sound of much stamping in the hall, and presently\r\nBilly returned in front of the Otter, who threw himself on the Rat with\r\nan embrace and a shout of affectionate greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet off!\xe2\x80\x9d spluttered the Rat, with his mouth full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThought I should find you here all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Otter cheerfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were all in a great state of alarm along River Bank when I\r\narrived this morning. Rat never been home all night\xe2\x80\x94nor Mole\r\neither\xe2\x80\x94something dreadful must have happened, they said; and the snow\r\nhad covered up all your tracks, of course. But I knew that when people\r\nwere in any fix they mostly went to Badger, or else Badger got to know\r\nof it somehow, so I came straight off here, through the Wild Wood and\r\nthe snow! My! it was fine, coming through the snow as the red sun was\r\nrising and showing against the black tree-trunks! As you went along in\r\nthe stillness, every now and then masses of snow slid off the branches\r\nsuddenly with a flop! making you jump and run for cover. Snow-castles\r\nand snow-caverns had sprung up out of nowhere in the night\xe2\x80\x94and snow\r\nbridges, terraces, ramparts\xe2\x80\x94I could have stayed and played with them\r\nfor hours. Here and there great branches had been torn away by the\r\nsheer weight of the snow, and robins perched and hopped on them in\r\ntheir perky conceited way, just as if they had done it themselves. A\r\nragged string of wild geese passed overhead, high on the grey sky, and\r\na few rooks whirled over the trees, inspected, and flapped off\r\nhomewards with a disgusted expression; but I met no sensible being to\r\nask the news of. About halfway across I came on a rabbit sitting on a\r\nstump, cleaning his silly face with his paws. He was a pretty scared\r\nanimal when I crept up behind him and placed a heavy forepaw on his\r\nshoulder. I had to cuff his head once or twice to get any sense out of\r\nit at all. At last I managed to extract from him that Mole had been\r\nseen in the Wild Wood last night by one of them. It was the talk of the\r\nburrows, he said, how Mole, Mr. Rat\xe2\x80\x99s particular friend, was in a bad\r\nfix; how he had lost his way, and \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99 were up and out hunting, and\r\nwere chivvying him round and round. \xe2\x80\x98Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t any of you _do_\r\nsomething?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98You mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be blest with brains, but there are\r\nhundreds and hundreds of you, big, stout fellows, as fat as butter, and\r\nyour burrows running in all directions, and you could have taken him in\r\nand made him safe and comfortable, or tried to, at all events.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What,\r\n_us?_\xe2\x80\x99 he merely said: \xe2\x80\x98_do_ something? us rabbits?\xe2\x80\x99 So I cuffed him\r\nagain and left him. There was nothing else to be done. At any rate, I\r\nhad learnt something; and if I had had the luck to meet any of \xe2\x80\x98Them\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d have learnt something more\xe2\x80\x94or _they_ would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you at all\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94nervous?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole, some of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterror coming back to him at the mention of the Wild Wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNervous?\xe2\x80\x9d The Otter showed a gleaming set of strong white teeth as he\r\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give \xe2\x80\x99em nerves if any of them tried anything on with me.\r\nHere, Mole, fry me some slices of ham, like the good little chap you\r\nare. I\xe2\x80\x99m frightfully hungry, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got any amount to say to Ratty\r\nhere. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him for an age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the good-natured Mole, having cut some slices of ham, set the\r\nhedgehogs to fry it, and returned to his own breakfast, while the Otter\r\nand the Rat, their heads together, eagerly talked river-shop, which is\r\nlong shop and talk that is endless, running on like the babbling river\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nA plate of fried ham had just been cleared and sent back for more, when\r\nthe Badger entered, yawning and rubbing his eyes, and greeted them all\r\nin his quiet, simple way, with kind enquiries for every one. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must\r\nbe getting on for luncheon time,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked to the Otter. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter\r\nstop and have it with us. You must be hungry, this cold morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Otter, winking at the Mole. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sight of these\r\ngreedy young hedgehogs stuffing themselves with fried ham makes me feel\r\npositively famished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hedgehogs, who were just beginning to feel hungry again after their\r\nporridge, and after working so hard at their frying, looked timidly up\r\nat Mr. Badger, but were too shy to say anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you two youngsters be off home to your mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger\r\nkindly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send some one with you to show you the way. You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant any dinner to-day, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave them sixpence apiece and a pat on the head, and they went off\r\nwith much respectful swinging of caps and touching of forelocks.\r\n\r\nPresently they all sat down to luncheon together. The Mole found\r\nhimself placed next to Mr. Badger, and, as the other two were still\r\ndeep in river-gossip from which nothing could divert them, he took the\r\nopportunity to tell Badger how comfortable and home-like it all felt to\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce well underground,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know exactly where you are.\r\nNothing can happen to you, and nothing can get at you. You\xe2\x80\x99re entirely\r\nyour own master, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to consult anybody or mind what\r\nthey say. Things go on all the same overhead, and you let \xe2\x80\x99em, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t bother about \xe2\x80\x99em. When you want to, up you go, and there the\r\nthings are, waiting for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Badger simply beamed on him. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no security, or peace and tranquillity, except\r\nunderground. And then, if your ideas get larger and you want to\r\nexpand\xe2\x80\x94why, a dig and a scrape, and there you are! If you feel your\r\nhouse is a bit too big, you stop up a hole or two, and there you are\r\nagain! No builders, no tradesmen, no remarks passed on you by fellows\r\nlooking over your wall, and, above all, no _weather_. Look at Rat, now.\r\nA couple of feet of flood water, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got to move into hired\r\nlodgings; uncomfortable, inconveniently situated, and horribly\r\nexpensive. Take Toad. I say nothing against Toad Hall; quite the best\r\nhouse in these parts, _as_ a house. But supposing a fire breaks\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s Toad? Supposing tiles are blown off, or walls sink or\r\ncrack, or windows get broken\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s Toad? Supposing the rooms are\r\ndraughty\xe2\x80\x94I _hate_ a draught myself\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s Toad? No, up and out of\r\ndoors is good enough to roam about and get one\xe2\x80\x99s living in; but\r\nunderground to come back to at last\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my idea of _home!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole assented heartily; and the Badger in consequence got very\r\nfriendly with him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen lunch is over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you all\r\nround this little place of mine. I can see you\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate it. You\r\nunderstand what domestic architecture ought to be, you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon, accordingly, when the other two had settled themselves\r\ninto the chimney-corner and had started a heated argument on the\r\nsubject of _eels_, the Badger lighted a lantern and bade the Mole\r\nfollow him. Crossing the hall, they passed down one of the principal\r\ntunnels, and the wavering light of the lantern gave glimpses on either\r\nside of rooms both large and small, some mere cupboards, others nearly\r\nas broad and imposing as Toad\xe2\x80\x99s dining-hall. A narrow passage at right\r\nangles led them into another corridor, and here the same thing was\r\nrepeated. The Mole was staggered at the size, the extent, the\r\nramifications of it all; at the length of the dim passages, the solid\r\nvaultings of the crammed store-chambers, the masonry everywhere, the\r\npillars, the arches, the pavements. \xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth, Badger,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you ever find time and strength to do all this? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nastonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _would_ be astonishing indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger simply, \xe2\x80\x9cif I _had_\r\ndone it. But as a matter of fact I did none of it\xe2\x80\x94only cleaned out the\r\npassages and chambers, as far as I had need of them. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots more\r\nof it, all round about. I see you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, and I must explain\r\nit to you. Well, very long ago, on the spot where the Wild Wood waves\r\nnow, before ever it had planted itself and grown up to what it now is,\r\nthere was a city\xe2\x80\x94a city of people, you know. Here, where we are\r\nstanding, they lived, and walked, and talked, and slept, and carried on\r\ntheir business. Here they stabled their horses and feasted, from here\r\nthey rode out to fight or drove out to trade. They were a powerful\r\npeople, and rich, and great builders. They built to last, for they\r\nthought their city would last for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has become of them all?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can tell?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople come\xe2\x80\x94they stay for a while,\r\nthey flourish, they build\xe2\x80\x94and they go. It is their way. But we remain.\r\nThere were badgers here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told, long before that same city\r\never came to be. And now there are badgers here again. We are an\r\nenduring lot, and we may move out for a time, but we wait, and are\r\npatient, and back we come. And so it will ever be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and when they went at last, those people?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they went,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Badger, \xe2\x80\x9cthe strong winds and\r\npersistent rains took the matter in hand, patiently, ceaselessly, year\r\nafter year. Perhaps we badgers too, in our small way, helped a\r\nlittle\xe2\x80\x94who knows? It was all down, down, down, gradually\xe2\x80\x94ruin and\r\nlevelling and disappearance. Then it was all up, up, up, gradually, as\r\nseeds grew to saplings, and saplings to forest trees, and bramble and\r\nfern came creeping in to help. Leaf-mould rose and obliterated, streams\r\nin their winter freshets brought sand and soil to clog and to cover,\r\nand in course of time our home was ready for us again, and we moved in.\r\nUp above us, on the surface, the same thing happened. Animals arrived,\r\nliked the look of the place, took up their quarters, settled down,\r\nspread, and flourished. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother themselves about the\r\npast\xe2\x80\x94they never do; they\xe2\x80\x99re too busy. The place was a bit humpy and\r\nhillocky, naturally, and full of holes; but that was rather an\r\nadvantage. And they don\xe2\x80\x99t bother about the future, either\xe2\x80\x94the future\r\nwhen perhaps the people will move in again\xe2\x80\x94for a time\xe2\x80\x94as may very well\r\nbe. The Wild Wood is pretty well populated by now; with all the usual\r\nlot, good, bad, and indifferent\xe2\x80\x94I name no names. It takes all sorts to\r\nmake a world. But I fancy you know something about them yourself by\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, with a slight shiver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, patting him on the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cit was\r\nyour first experience of them, you see. They\xe2\x80\x99re not so bad really; and\r\nwe must all live and let live. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll pass the word around to-morrow,\r\nand I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have no further trouble. Any friend of _mine_ walks\r\nwhere he likes in this country, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll know the reason why!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to the kitchen again, they found the Rat walking up\r\nand down, very restless. The underground atmosphere was oppressing him\r\nand getting on his nerves, and he seemed really to be afraid that the\r\nriver would run away if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there to look after it. So he had his\r\novercoat on, and his pistols thrust into his belt again. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along,\r\nMole,\xe2\x80\x9d he said anxiously, as soon as he caught sight of them. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must\r\nget off while it\xe2\x80\x99s daylight. Don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend another night in the\r\nWild Wood again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, my fine fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Otter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming along\r\nwith you, and I know every path blindfold; and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a head that\r\nneeds to be punched, you can confidently rely upon me to punch it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really needn\xe2\x80\x99t fret, Ratty,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Badger placidly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\npassages run further than you think, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve bolt-holes to the edge of\r\nthe wood in several directions, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for everybody to\r\nknow about them. When you really have to go, you shall leave by one of\r\nmy short cuts. Meantime, make yourself easy, and sit down again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat was nevertheless still anxious to be off and attend to his\r\nriver, so the Badger, taking up his lantern again, led the way along a\r\ndamp and airless tunnel that wound and dipped, part vaulted, part hewn\r\nthrough solid rock, for a weary distance that seemed to be miles. At\r\nlast daylight began to show itself confusedly through tangled growth\r\noverhanging the mouth of the passage; and the Badger, bidding them a\r\nhasty good-bye, pushed them hurriedly through the opening, made\r\neverything look as natural as possible again, with creepers, brushwood,\r\nand dead leaves, and retreated.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves standing on the very edge of the Wild Wood. Rocks\r\nand brambles and tree-roots behind them, confusedly heaped and tangled;\r\nin front, a great space of quiet fields, hemmed by lines of hedges\r\nblack on the snow, and, far ahead, a glint of the familiar old river,\r\nwhile the wintry sun hung red and low on the horizon. The Otter, as\r\nknowing all the paths, took charge of the party, and they trailed out\r\non a bee-line for a distant stile. Pausing there a moment and looking\r\nback, they saw the whole mass of the Wild Wood, dense, menacing,\r\ncompact, grimly set in vast white surroundings; simultaneously they\r\nturned and made swiftly for home, for firelight and the familiar things\r\nit played on, for the voice, sounding cheerily outside their window, of\r\nthe river that they knew and trusted in all its moods, that never made\r\nthem afraid with any amazement.\r\n\r\nAs he hurried along, eagerly anticipating the moment when he would be\r\nat home again among the things he knew and liked, the Mole saw clearly\r\nthat he was an animal of tilled field and hedge-row, linked to the\r\nploughed furrow, the frequented pasture, the lane of evening\r\nlingerings, the cultivated garden-plot. For others the asperities, the\r\nstubborn endurance, or the clash of actual conflict, that went with\r\nNature in the rough; he must be wise, must keep to the pleasant places\r\nin which his lines were laid and which held adventure enough, in their\r\nway, to last for a lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nDULCE DOMUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sheep ran huddling together against the hurdles, blowing out thin\r\nnostrils and stamping with delicate fore-feet, their heads thrown back\r\nand a light steam rising from the crowded sheep-pen into the frosty\r\nair, as the two animals hastened by in high spirits, with much chatter\r\nand laughter. They were returning across country after a long day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nouting with Otter, hunting and exploring on the wide uplands where\r\ncertain streams tributary to their own River had their first small\r\nbeginnings; and the shades of the short winter day were closing in on\r\nthem, and they had still some distance to go. Plodding at random across\r\nthe plough, they had heard the sheep and had made for them; and now,\r\nleading from the sheep-pen, they found a beaten track that made walking\r\na lighter business, and responded, moreover, to that small inquiring\r\nsomething which all animals carry inside them, saying unmistakably,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite right; _this_ leads home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks as if we were coming to a village,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole somewhat\r\ndubiously, slackening his pace, as the track, that had in time become a\r\npath and then had developed into a lane, now handed them over to the\r\ncharge of a well-metalled road. The animals did not hold with villages,\r\nand their own highways, thickly frequented as they were, took an\r\nindependent course, regardless of church, post office, or public-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this season of the year they\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nsafe indoors by this time, sitting round the fire; men, women, and\r\nchildren, dogs and cats and all. We shall slip through all right,\r\nwithout any bother or unpleasantness, and we can have a look at them\r\nthrough their windows if you like, and see what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rapid nightfall of mid-December had quite beset the little village\r\nas they approached it on soft feet over a first thin fall of powdery\r\nsnow. Little was visible but squares of a dusky orange-red on either\r\nside of the street, where the firelight or lamplight of each cottage\r\noverflowed through the casements into the dark world without. Most of\r\nthe low latticed windows were innocent of blinds, and to the lookers-in\r\nfrom outside, the inmates, gathered round the tea-table, absorbed in\r\nhandiwork, or talking with laughter and gesture, had each that happy\r\ngrace which is the last thing the skilled actor shall capture\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnatural grace which goes with perfect unconsciousness of observation.\r\nMoving at will from one theatre to another, the two spectators, so far\r\nfrom home themselves, had something of wistfulness in their eyes as\r\nthey watched a cat being stroked, a sleepy child picked up and huddled\r\noff to bed, or a tired man stretch and knock out his pipe on the end of\r\na smouldering log.\r\n\r\nBut it was from one little window, with its blind drawn down, a mere\r\nblank transparency on the night, that the sense of home and the little\r\ncurtained world within walls\xe2\x80\x94the larger stressful world of outside\r\nNature shut out and forgotten\xe2\x80\x94most pulsated. Close against the white\r\nblind hung a bird-cage, clearly silhouetted, every wire, perch, and\r\nappurtenance distinct and recognisable, even to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s dull-edged\r\nlump of sugar. On the middle perch the fluffy occupant, head tucked\r\nwell into feathers, seemed so near to them as to be easily stroked, had\r\nthey tried; even the delicate tips of his plumped-out plumage pencilled\r\nplainly on the illuminated screen. As they looked, the sleepy little\r\nfellow stirred uneasily, woke, shook himself, and raised his head. They\r\ncould see the gape of his tiny beak as he yawned in a bored sort of\r\nway, looked round, and then settled his head into his back again, while\r\nthe ruffled feathers gradually subsided into perfect stillness. Then a\r\ngust of bitter wind took them in the back of the neck, a small sting of\r\nfrozen sleet on the skin woke them as from a dream, and they knew their\r\ntoes to be cold and their legs tired, and their own home distant a\r\nweary way.\r\n\r\nOnce beyond the village, where the cottages ceased abruptly, on either\r\nside of the road they could smell through the darkness the friendly\r\nfields again; and they braced themselves for the last long stretch, the\r\nhome stretch, the stretch that we know is bound to end, some time, in\r\nthe rattle of the door-latch, the sudden firelight, and the sight of\r\nfamiliar things greeting us as long-absent travellers from far\r\nover-sea. They plodded along steadily and silently, each of them\r\nthinking his own thoughts. The Mole\xe2\x80\x99s ran a good deal on supper, as it\r\nwas pitch-dark, and it was all a strange country for him as far as he\r\nknew, and he was following obediently in the wake of the Rat, leaving\r\nthe guidance entirely to him. As for the Rat, he was walking a little\r\nway ahead, as his habit was, his shoulders humped, his eyes fixed on\r\nthe straight grey road in front of him; so he did not notice poor Mole\r\nwhen suddenly the summons reached him, and took him like an electric\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nWe others, who have long lost the more subtle of the physical senses,\r\nhave not even proper terms to express an animal\xe2\x80\x99s inter-communications\r\nwith his surroundings, living or otherwise, and have only the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csmell,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, to include the whole range of delicate thrills\r\nwhich murmur in the nose of the animal night and day, summoning,\r\nwarning, inciting, repelling. It was one of these mysterious fairy\r\ncalls from out the void that suddenly reached Mole in the darkness,\r\nmaking him tingle through and through with its very familiar appeal,\r\neven while yet he could not clearly remember what it was. He stopped\r\ndead in his tracks, his nose searching hither and thither in its\r\nefforts to recapture the fine filament, the telegraphic current, that\r\nhad so strongly moved him. A moment, and he had caught it again; and\r\nwith it this time came recollection in fullest flood.\r\n\r\nHome! That was what they meant, those caressing appeals, those soft\r\ntouches wafted through the air, those invisible little hands pulling\r\nand tugging, all one way! Why, it must be quite close by him at that\r\nmoment, his old home that he had hurriedly forsaken and never sought\r\nagain, that day when he first found the river! And now it was sending\r\nout its scouts and its messengers to capture him and bring him in.\r\nSince his escape on that bright morning he had hardly given it a\r\nthought, so absorbed had he been in his new life, in all its pleasures,\r\nits surprises, its fresh and captivating experiences. Now, with a rush\r\nof old memories, how clearly it stood up before him, in the darkness!\r\nShabby indeed, and small and poorly furnished, and yet his, the home he\r\nhad made for himself, the home he had been so happy to get back to\r\nafter his day\xe2\x80\x99s work. And the home had been happy with him, too,\r\nevidently, and was missing him, and wanted him back, and was telling\r\nhim so, through his nose, sorrowfully, reproachfully, but with no\r\nbitterness or anger; only with plaintive reminder that it was there,\r\nand wanted him.\r\n\r\nThe call was clear, the summons was plain. He must obey it instantly,\r\nand go. \xe2\x80\x9cRatty!\xe2\x80\x9d he called, full of joyful excitement, \xe2\x80\x9chold on! Come\r\nback! I want you, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _come_ along, Mole, do!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat cheerfully, still\r\nplodding along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Please_ stop, Ratty!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the poor Mole, in anguish of heart.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand! It\xe2\x80\x99s my home, my old home! I\xe2\x80\x99ve just come across\r\nthe smell of it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s close by here, really quite close. And I\r\n_must_ go to it, I must, I must! Oh, come back, Ratty! Please, please\r\ncome back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat was by this time very far ahead, too far to hear clearly what\r\nthe Mole was calling, too far to catch the sharp note of painful appeal\r\nin his voice. And he was much taken up with the weather, for he too\r\ncould smell something\xe2\x80\x94something suspiciously like approaching snow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMole, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t stop now, really!\xe2\x80\x9d he called back. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll come for it\r\nto-morrow, whatever it is you\xe2\x80\x99ve found. But I daren\xe2\x80\x99t stop now\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlate, and the snow\xe2\x80\x99s coming on again, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the way! And\r\nI want your nose, Mole, so come on quick, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthe Rat pressed forward on his way without waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\nPoor Mole stood alone in the road, his heart torn asunder, and a big\r\nsob gathering, gathering, somewhere low down inside him, to leap up to\r\nthe surface presently, he knew, in passionate escape. But even under\r\nsuch a test as this his loyalty to his friend stood firm. Never for a\r\nmoment did he dream of abandoning him. Meanwhile, the wafts from his\r\nold home pleaded, whispered, conjured, and finally claimed him\r\nimperiously. He dared not tarry longer within their magic circle. With\r\na wrench that tore his very heartstrings he set his face down the road\r\nand followed submissively in the track of the Rat, while faint, thin\r\nlittle smells, still dogging his retreating nose, reproached him for\r\nhis new friendship and his callous forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nWith an effort he caught up to the unsuspecting Rat, who began\r\nchattering cheerfully about what they would do when they got back, and\r\nhow jolly a fire of logs in the parlour would be, and what a supper he\r\nmeant to eat; never noticing his companion\xe2\x80\x99s silence and distressful\r\nstate of mind. At last, however, when they had gone some considerable\r\nway further, and were passing some tree-stumps at the edge of a copse\r\nthat bordered the road, he stopped and said kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Mole\r\nold chap, you seem dead tired. No talk left in you, and your feet\r\ndragging like lead. We\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down here for a minute and rest. The snow\r\nhas held off so far, and the best part of our journey is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole subsided forlornly on a tree-stump and tried to control\r\nhimself, for he felt it surely coming. The sob he had fought with so\r\nlong refused to be beaten. Up and up, it forced its way to the air, and\r\nthen another, and another, and others thick and fast; till poor Mole at\r\nlast gave up the struggle, and cried freely and helplessly and openly,\r\nnow that he knew it was all over and he had lost what he could hardly\r\nbe said to have found.\r\n\r\nThe Rat, astonished and dismayed at the violence of Mole\xe2\x80\x99s paroxysm of\r\ngrief, did not dare to speak for a while. At last he said, very quietly\r\nand sympathetically, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, old fellow? Whatever can be the\r\nmatter? Tell us your trouble, and let me see what I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mole found it difficult to get any words out between the upheavals\r\nof his chest that followed one upon another so quickly and held back\r\nspeech and choked it as it came. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x94shabby, dingy little\r\nplace,\xe2\x80\x9d he sobbed forth at last, brokenly: \xe2\x80\x9cnot like\xe2\x80\x94your cosy\r\nquarters\xe2\x80\x94or Toad\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful hall\xe2\x80\x94or Badger\xe2\x80\x99s great house\xe2\x80\x94but it was my\r\nown little home\xe2\x80\x94and I was fond of it\xe2\x80\x94and I went away and forgot all\r\nabout it\xe2\x80\x94and then I smelt it suddenly\xe2\x80\x94on the road, when I called and\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen, Rat\xe2\x80\x94and everything came back to me with a rush\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nI _wanted_ it!\xe2\x80\x94O dear, O dear!\xe2\x80\x94and when you _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ turn back,\r\nRatty\xe2\x80\x94and I had to leave it, though I was smelling it all the time\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthought my heart would break.\xe2\x80\x94We might have just gone and had one look\r\nat it, Ratty\xe2\x80\x94only one look\xe2\x80\x94it was close by\xe2\x80\x94but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t turn back,\r\nRatty, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t turn back! O dear, O dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRecollection brought fresh waves of sorrow, and sobs again took full\r\ncharge of him, preventing further speech.\r\n\r\nThe Rat stared straight in front of him, saying nothing, only patting\r\nMole gently on the shoulder. After a time he muttered gloomily, \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nit all now! What a _pig_ I have been! A pig\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s me! Just a pig\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nplain pig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited till Mole\xe2\x80\x99s sobs became gradually less stormy and more\r\nrhythmical; he waited till at last sniffs were frequent and sobs only\r\nintermittent. Then he rose from his seat, and, remarking carelessly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now we\xe2\x80\x99d really better be getting on, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d set off up the\r\nroad again, over the toilsome way they had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherever are you (hic) going to (hic), Ratty?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the tearful Mole,\r\nlooking up in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to find that home of yours, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat\r\npleasantly; \xe2\x80\x9cso you had better come along, for it will take some\r\nfinding, and we shall want your nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come back, Ratty, do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Mole, getting up and hurrying\r\nafter him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good, I tell you! It\xe2\x80\x99s too late, and too dark, and\r\nthe place is too far off, and the snow\xe2\x80\x99s coming! And\xe2\x80\x94and I never meant\r\nto let you know I was feeling that way about it\xe2\x80\x94it was all an accident\r\nand a mistake! And think of River Bank, and your supper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang River Bank, and supper too!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to find this place now, if I stay out all night. So cheer up,\r\nold chap, and take my arm, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll very soon be back there again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill snuffling, pleading, and reluctant, Mole suffered himself to be\r\ndragged back along the road by his imperious companion, who by a flow\r\nof cheerful talk and anecdote endeavoured to beguile his spirits back\r\nand make the weary way seem shorter. When at last it seemed to the Rat\r\nthat they must be nearing that part of the road where the Mole had been\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cheld up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, no more talking. Business! Use your nose, and\r\ngive your mind to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey moved on in silence for some little way, when suddenly the Rat was\r\nconscious, through his arm that was linked in Mole\xe2\x80\x99s, of a faint sort\r\nof electric thrill that was passing down that animal\xe2\x80\x99s body. Instantly\r\nhe disengaged himself, fell back a pace, and waited, all attention.\r\n\r\nThe signals were coming through!\r\n\r\nMole stood a moment rigid, while his uplifted nose, quivering slightly,\r\nfelt the air.\r\n\r\nThen a short, quick run forward\xe2\x80\x94a fault\xe2\x80\x94a check\xe2\x80\x94a try back; and then a\r\nslow, steady, confident advance.\r\n\r\nThe Rat, much excited, kept close to his heels as the Mole, with\r\nsomething of the air of a sleep-walker, crossed a dry ditch, scrambled\r\nthrough a hedge, and nosed his way over a field open and trackless and\r\nbare in the faint starlight.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without giving warning, he dived; but the Rat was on the\r\nalert, and promptly followed him down the tunnel to which his unerring\r\nnose had faithfully led him.\r\n\r\nIt was close and airless, and the earthy smell was strong, and it\r\nseemed a long time to Rat ere the passage ended and he could stand\r\nerect and stretch and shake himself. The Mole struck a match, and by\r\nits light the Rat saw that they were standing in an open space, neatly\r\nswept and sanded underfoot, and directly facing them was Mole\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nfront door, with \xe2\x80\x9cMole End\xe2\x80\x9d painted, in Gothic lettering, over the\r\nbell-pull at the side.\r\n\r\nMole reached down a lantern from a nail on the wall and lit it... and\r\nthe Rat, looking round him, saw that they were in a sort of fore-court.\r\nA garden-seat stood on one side of the door, and on the other a roller;\r\nfor the Mole, who was a tidy animal when at home, could not stand\r\nhaving his ground kicked up by other animals into little runs that\r\nended in earth-heaps. On the walls hung wire baskets with ferns in\r\nthem, alternating with brackets carrying plaster statuary\xe2\x80\x94Garibaldi,\r\nand the infant Samuel, and Queen Victoria, and other heroes of modern\r\nItaly. Down on one side of the forecourt ran a skittle-alley, with\r\nbenches along it and little wooden tables marked with rings that hinted\r\nat beer-mugs. In the middle was a small round pond containing gold-fish\r\nand surrounded by a cockle-shell border. Out of the centre of the pond\r\nrose a fanciful erection clothed in more cockle-shells and topped by a\r\nlarge silvered glass ball that reflected everything all wrong and had a\r\nvery pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nMole\xe2\x80\x99s face-beamed at the sight of all these objects so dear to him,\r\nand he hurried Rat through the door, lit a lamp in the hall, and took\r\none glance round his old home. He saw the dust lying thick on\r\neverything, saw the cheerless, deserted look of the long-neglected\r\nhouse, and its narrow, meagre dimensions, its worn and shabby\r\ncontents\xe2\x80\x94and collapsed again on a hall-chair, his nose to his paws. \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nRatty!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried dismally, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy ever did I do it? Why did I bring you\r\nto this poor, cold little place, on a night like this, when you might\r\nhave been at River Bank by this time, toasting your toes before a\r\nblazing fire, with all your own nice things about you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat paid no heed to his doleful self-reproaches. He was running\r\nhere and there, opening doors, inspecting rooms and cupboards, and\r\nlighting lamps and candles and sticking them, up everywhere. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\ncapital little house this is!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cSo compact! So\r\nwell planned! Everything here and everything in its place! We\xe2\x80\x99ll make a\r\njolly night of it. The first thing we want is a good fire; I\xe2\x80\x99ll see to\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94I always know where to find things. So this is the parlour?\r\nSplendid! Your own idea, those little sleeping-bunks in the wall?\r\nCapital! Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch the wood and the coals, and you get a duster,\r\nMole\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll find one in the drawer of the kitchen table\xe2\x80\x94and try and\r\nsmarten things up a bit. Bustle about, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his inspiriting companion, the Mole roused himself and\r\ndusted and polished with energy and heartiness, while the Rat, running\r\nto and fro with armfuls of fuel, soon had a cheerful blaze roaring up\r\nthe chimney. He hailed the Mole to come and warm himself; but Mole\r\npromptly had another fit of the blues, dropping down on a couch in dark\r\ndespair and burying his face in his duster. \xe2\x80\x9cRat,\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\nabout your supper, you poor, cold, hungry, weary animal? I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing\r\nto give you\xe2\x80\x94nothing\xe2\x80\x94not a crumb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fellow you are for giving in!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat reproachfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, only just now I saw a sardine-opener on the kitchen dresser,\r\nquite distinctly; and everybody knows that means there are sardines\r\nabout somewhere in the neighbourhood. Rouse yourself! pull yourself\r\ntogether, and come with me and forage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went and foraged accordingly, hunting through every cupboard and\r\nturning out every drawer. The result was not so very depressing after\r\nall, though of course it might have been better; a tin of sardines\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nbox of captain\xe2\x80\x99s biscuits, nearly full\xe2\x80\x94and a German sausage encased in\r\nsilver paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a banquet for you!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Rat, as he arranged the\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cI know some animals who would give their ears to be sitting\r\ndown to supper with us to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo bread!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the Mole dolorously; \xe2\x80\x9cno butter, no\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo _p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 de foie gras_, no champagne!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Rat, grinning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that reminds me\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s that little door at the end of the passage?\r\nYour cellar, of course! Every luxury in this house! Just you wait a\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made for the cellar-door, and presently reappeared, somewhat dusty,\r\nwith a bottle of beer in each paw and another under each arm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSelf-indulgent beggar you seem to be, Mole,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed. \xe2\x80\x9cDeny\r\nyourself nothing. This is really the jolliest little place I ever was\r\nin. Now, wherever did you pick up those prints? Make the place look so\r\nhome-like, they do. No wonder you\xe2\x80\x99re so fond of it, Mole. Tell us all\r\nabout it, and how you came to make it what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, while the Rat busied himself fetching plates, and knives and\r\nforks, and mustard which he mixed in an egg-cup, the Mole, his bosom\r\nstill heaving with the stress of his recent emotion, related\xe2\x80\x94somewhat\r\nshyly at first, but with more freedom as he warmed to his subject\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nthis was planned, and how that was thought out, and how this was got\r\nthrough a windfall from an aunt, and that was a wonderful find and a\r\nbargain, and this other thing was bought out of laborious savings and a\r\ncertain amount of \xe2\x80\x9cgoing without.\xe2\x80\x9d His spirits finally quite restored,\r\nhe must needs go and caress his possessions, and take a lamp and show\r\noff their points to his visitor and expatiate on them, quite forgetful\r\nof the supper they both so much needed; Rat, who was desperately hungry\r\nbut strove to conceal it, nodding seriously, examining with a puckered\r\nbrow, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cwonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmost remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d at intervals,\r\nwhen the chance for an observation was given him.\r\n\r\nAt last the Rat succeeded in decoying him to the table, and had just\r\ngot seriously to work with the sardine-opener when sounds were heard\r\nfrom the fore-court without\xe2\x80\x94sounds like the scuffling of small feet in\r\nthe gravel and a confused murmur of tiny voices, while broken sentences\r\nreached them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNow, all in a line\xe2\x80\x94hold the lantern up a bit, Tommy\xe2\x80\x94clear\r\nyour throats first\xe2\x80\x94no coughing after I say one, two, three.\xe2\x80\x94Where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyoung Bill?\xe2\x80\x94Here, come on, do, we\xe2\x80\x99re all a-waiting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Rat, pausing in his labours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it must be the field-mice,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Mole, with a touch of\r\npride in his manner. \xe2\x80\x9cThey go round carol-singing regularly at this\r\ntime of the year. They\xe2\x80\x99re quite an institution in these parts. And they\r\nnever pass me over\xe2\x80\x94they come to Mole End last of all; and I used to\r\ngive them hot drinks, and supper too sometimes, when I could afford it.\r\nIt will be like old times to hear them again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at them!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat, jumping up and running to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty sight, and a seasonable one, that met their eyes when\r\nthey flung the door open. In the fore-court, lit by the dim rays of a\r\nhorn lantern, some eight or ten little fieldmice stood in a semicircle,\r\nred worsted comforters round their throats, their fore-paws thrust deep\r\ninto their pockets, their feet jigging for warmth. With bright beady\r\neyes they glanced shyly at each other, sniggering a little, sniffing\r\nand applying coat-sleeves a good deal. As the door opened, one of the\r\nelder ones that carried the lantern was just saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, one,\r\ntwo, three!\xe2\x80\x9d and forthwith their shrill little voices uprose on the\r\nair, singing one of the old-time carols that their forefathers composed\r\nin fields that were fallow and held by frost, or when snow-bound in\r\nchimney corners, and handed down to be sung in the miry street to\r\nlamp-lit windows at Yule-time.\r\n\r\nCAROL\r\n\r\nVillagers all, this frosty tide,\r\nLet your doors swing open wide,\r\nThough wind may follow, and snow beside,\r\nYet draw us in by your fire to bide;\r\n    Joy shall be yours in the morning!\r\n\r\nHere we stand in the cold and the sleet,\r\nBlowing fingers and stamping feet,\r\nCome from far away you to greet\xe2\x80\x94\r\nYou by the fire and we in the street\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Bidding you joy in the morning!\r\n\r\nFor ere one half of the night was gone,\r\nSudden a star has led us on,\r\nRaining bliss and benison\xe2\x80\x94\r\nBliss to-morrow and more anon,\r\n    Joy for every morning!\r\n\r\nGoodman Joseph toiled through the snow\xe2\x80\x94\r\nSaw the star o\xe2\x80\x99er a stable low;\r\nMary she might not further go\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWelcome thatch, and litter below!\r\n    Joy was hers in the morning!\r\n\r\nAnd then they heard the angels tell\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho were the first to cry _Nowell?_\r\nAnimals all, as it befell,\r\nIn the stable where they did dwell!\r\n    Joy shall be theirs in the morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voices ceased, the singers, bashful but smiling, exchanged sidelong\r\nglances, and silence succeeded\xe2\x80\x94but for a moment only. Then, from up\r\nabove and far away, down the tunnel they had so lately travelled was\r\nborne to their ears in a faint musical hum the sound of distant bells\r\nringing a joyful and clangorous peal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well sung, boys!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now come along in,\r\nall of you, and warm yourselves by the fire, and have something hot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, come along, field-mice,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Mole eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is quite\r\nlike old times! Shut the door after you. Pull up that settle to the\r\nfire. Now, you just wait a minute, while we\xe2\x80\x94O, Ratty!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in\r\ndespair, plumping down on a seat, with tears impending. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever are\r\nwe doing? We\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to give them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave all that to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the masterful Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, you with the\r\nlantern! Come over this way. I want to talk to you. Now, tell me, are\r\nthere any shops open at this hour of the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the field-mouse respectfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this\r\ntime of the year our shops keep open to all sorts of hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen look here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go off at once, you and your\r\nlantern, and you get me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere much muttered conversation ensued, and the Mole only heard bits of\r\nit, such as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFresh, mind!\xe2\x80\x94no, a pound of that will do\xe2\x80\x94see you get\r\nBuggins\xe2\x80\x99s, for I won\xe2\x80\x99t have any other\xe2\x80\x94no, only the best\xe2\x80\x94if you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget it there, try somewhere else\xe2\x80\x94yes, of course, home-made, no tinned\r\nstuff\xe2\x80\x94well then, do the best you can!\xe2\x80\x9d Finally, there was a chink of\r\ncoin passing from paw to paw, the field-mouse was provided with an\r\nample basket for his purchases, and off he hurried, he and his lantern.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the field-mice, perched in a row on the settle, their small\r\nlegs swinging, gave themselves up to enjoyment of the fire, and toasted\r\ntheir chilblains till they tingled; while the Mole, failing to draw\r\nthem into easy conversation, plunged into family history and made each\r\nof them recite the names of his numerous brothers, who were too young,\r\nit appeared, to be allowed to go out a-carolling this year, but looked\r\nforward very shortly to winning the parental consent.\r\n\r\nThe Rat, meanwhile, was busy examining the label on one of the\r\nbeer-bottles. \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive this to be Old Burton,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked\r\napprovingly. \xe2\x80\x9c_Sensible_ Mole! The very thing! Now we shall be able to\r\nmull some ale! Get the things ready, Mole, while I draw the corks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to prepare the brew and thrust the tin heater well\r\ninto the red heart of the fire; and soon every field-mouse was sipping\r\nand coughing and choking (for a little mulled ale goes a long way) and\r\nwiping his eyes and laughing and forgetting he had ever been cold in\r\nall his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey act plays too, these fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d the Mole explained to the Rat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake them up all by themselves, and act them afterwards. And very well\r\nthey do it, too! They gave us a capital one last year, about a\r\nfield-mouse who was captured at sea by a Barbary corsair, and made to\r\nrow in a galley; and when he escaped and got home again, his lady-love\r\nhad gone into a convent. Here, _you!_ You were in it, I remember. Get\r\nup and recite a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe field-mouse addressed got up on his legs, giggled shyly, looked\r\nround the room, and remained absolutely tongue-tied. His comrades\r\ncheered him on, Mole coaxed and encouraged him, and the Rat went so far\r\nas to take him by the shoulders and shake him; but nothing could\r\novercome his stage-fright. They were all busily engaged on him like\r\nwatermen applying the Royal Humane Society\xe2\x80\x99s regulations to a case of\r\nlong submersion, when the latch clicked, the door opened, and the\r\nfield-mouse with the lantern reappeared, staggering under the weight of\r\nhis basket.\r\n\r\nThere was no more talk of play-acting once the very real and solid\r\ncontents of the basket had been tumbled out on the table. Under the\r\ngeneralship of Rat, everybody was set to do something or to fetch\r\nsomething. In a very few minutes supper was ready, and Mole, as he took\r\nthe head of the table in a sort of a dream, saw a lately barren board\r\nset thick with savoury comforts; saw his little friends\xe2\x80\x99 faces brighten\r\nand beam as they fell to without delay; and then let himself loose\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nhe was famished indeed\xe2\x80\x94on the provender so magically provided, thinking\r\nwhat a happy home-coming this had turned out, after all. As they ate,\r\nthey talked of old times, and the field-mice gave him the local gossip\r\nup to date, and answered as well as they could the hundred questions he\r\nhad to ask them. The Rat said little or nothing, only taking care that\r\neach guest had what he wanted, and plenty of it, and that Mole had no\r\ntrouble or anxiety about anything.\r\n\r\nThey clattered off at last, very grateful and showering wishes of the\r\nseason, with their jacket pockets stuffed with remembrances for the\r\nsmall brothers and sisters at home. When the door had closed on the\r\nlast of them and the chink of the lanterns had died away, Mole and Rat\r\nkicked the fire up, drew their chairs in, brewed themselves a last\r\nnightcap of mulled ale, and discussed the events of the long day. At\r\nlast the Rat, with a tremendous yawn, said, \xe2\x80\x9cMole, old chap, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready\r\nto drop. Sleepy is simply not the word. That your own bunk over on that\r\nside? Very well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this. What a ripping little house this\r\nis! Everything so handy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clambered into his bunk and rolled himself well up in the blankets,\r\nand slumber gathered him forthwith, as a swathe of barley is folded\r\ninto the arms of the reaping machine.\r\n\r\nThe weary Mole also was glad to turn in without delay, and soon had his\r\nhead on his pillow, in great joy and contentment. But ere he closed his\r\neyes he let them wander round his old room, mellow in the glow of the\r\nfirelight that played or rested on familiar and friendly things which\r\nhad long been unconsciously a part of him, and now smilingly received\r\nhim back, without rancour. He was now in just the frame of mind that\r\nthe tactful Rat had quietly worked to bring about in him. He saw\r\nclearly how plain and simple\xe2\x80\x94how narrow, even\xe2\x80\x94it all was; but clearly,\r\ntoo, how much it all meant to him, and the special value of some such\r\nanchorage in one\xe2\x80\x99s existence. He did not at all want to abandon the new\r\nlife and its splendid spaces, to turn his back on sun and air and all\r\nthey offered him and creep home and stay there; the upper world was all\r\ntoo strong, it called to him still, even down there, and he knew he\r\nmust return to the larger stage. But it was good to think he had this\r\nto come back to; this place which was all his own, these things which\r\nwere so glad to see him again and could always be counted upon for the\r\nsame simple welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nMR. TOAD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a bright morning in the early part of summer; the river had\r\nresumed its wonted banks and its accustomed pace, and a hot sun seemed\r\nto be pulling everything green and bushy and spiky up out of the earth\r\ntowards him, as if by strings. The Mole and the Water Rat had been up\r\nsince dawn, very busy on matters connected with boats and the opening\r\nof the boating season; painting and varnishing, mending paddles,\r\nrepairing cushions, hunting for missing boat-hooks, and so on; and were\r\nfinishing breakfast in their little parlour and eagerly discussing\r\ntheir plans for the day, when a heavy knock sounded at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, all over egg. \xe2\x80\x9cSee who it is, Mole, like a good\r\nchap, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole went to attend the summons, and the Rat heard him utter a cry\r\nof surprise. Then he flung the parlour door open, and announced with\r\nmuch importance, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Badger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a wonderful thing, indeed, that the Badger should pay a formal\r\ncall on them, or indeed on anybody. He generally had to be caught, if\r\nyou wanted him badly, as he slipped quietly along a hedgerow of an\r\nearly morning or a late evening, or else hunted up in his own house in\r\nthe middle of the Wood, which was a serious undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Badger strode heavily into the room, and stood looking at the two\r\nanimals with an expression full of seriousness. The Rat let his\r\negg-spoon fall on the table-cloth, and sat open-mouthed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hour has come!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger at last with great solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat hour?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Rat uneasily, glancing at the clock on the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Whose_ hour, you should rather say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Badger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Toad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhour! The hour of Toad! I said I would take him in hand as soon as the\r\nwinter was well over, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take him in hand to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad\xe2\x80\x99s hour, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Mole delightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cHooray! I\r\nremember now! _We\xe2\x80\x99ll_ teach him to be a sensible Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis very morning,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Badger, taking an arm-chair, \xe2\x80\x9cas I\r\nlearnt last night from a trustworthy source, another new and\r\nexceptionally powerful motor-car will arrive at Toad Hall on approval\r\nor return. At this very moment, perhaps, Toad is busy arraying himself\r\nin those singularly hideous habiliments so dear to him, which transform\r\nhim from a (comparatively) good-looking Toad into an Object which\r\nthrows any decent-minded animal that comes across it into a violent\r\nfit. We must be up and doing, ere it is too late. You two animals will\r\naccompany me instantly to Toad Hall, and the work of rescue shall be\r\naccomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight you are!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat, starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll rescue the poor\r\nunhappy animal! We\xe2\x80\x99ll convert him! He\xe2\x80\x99ll be the most converted Toad\r\nthat ever was before we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey set off up the road on their mission of mercy, Badger leading the\r\nway. Animals when in company walk in a proper and sensible manner, in\r\nsingle file, instead of sprawling all across the road and being of no\r\nuse or support to each other in case of sudden trouble or danger.\r\n\r\nThey reached the carriage-drive of Toad Hall to find, as the Badger had\r\nanticipated, a shiny new motor-car, of great size, painted a bright red\r\n(Toad\xe2\x80\x99s favourite colour), standing in front of the house. As they\r\nneared the door it was flung open, and Mr. Toad, arrayed in goggles,\r\ncap, gaiters, and enormous overcoat, came swaggering down the steps,\r\ndrawing on his gauntleted gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo! come on, you fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried cheerfully on catching sight of\r\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just in time to come with me for a jolly\xe2\x80\x94to come for a\r\njolly\xe2\x80\x94for a\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94jolly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hearty accents faltered and fell away as he noticed the stern\r\nunbending look on the countenances of his silent friends, and his\r\ninvitation remained unfinished.\r\n\r\nThe Badger strode up the steps. \xe2\x80\x9cTake him inside,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sternly to\r\nhis companions. Then, as Toad was hustled through the door, struggling\r\nand protesting, he turned to the _chauffeur_ in charge of the new\r\nmotor-car.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you won\xe2\x80\x99t be wanted to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Toad has changed\r\nhis mind. He will not require the car. Please understand that this is\r\nfinal. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he followed the others inside and shut\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the Toad, when the four of them stood together\r\nin the Hall, \xe2\x80\x9cfirst of all, take those ridiculous things off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShan\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Toad, with great spirit. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of this\r\ngross outrage? I demand an instant explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake them off him, then, you two,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered the Badger briefly.\r\n\r\nThey had to lay Toad out on the floor, kicking and calling all sorts of\r\nnames, before they could get to work properly. Then the Rat sat on him,\r\nand the Mole got his motor-clothes off him bit by bit, and they stood\r\nhim up on his legs again. A good deal of his blustering spirit seemed\r\nto have evaporated with the removal of his fine panoply. Now that he\r\nwas merely Toad, and no longer the Terror of the Highway, he giggled\r\nfeebly and looked from one to the other appealingly, seeming quite to\r\nunderstand the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew it must come to this, sooner or later, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d the Badger\r\nexplained severely.\r\n\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve disregarded all the warnings we\xe2\x80\x99ve given you, you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on\r\nsquandering the money your father left you, and you\xe2\x80\x99re getting us\r\nanimals a bad name in the district by your furious driving and your\r\nsmashes and your rows with the police. Independence is all very well,\r\nbut we animals never allow our friends to make fools of themselves\r\nbeyond a certain limit; and that limit you\xe2\x80\x99ve reached. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ngood fellow in many respects, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be too hard on you.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make one more effort to bring you to reason. You will come with me\r\ninto the smoking-room, and there you will hear some facts about\r\nyourself; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see whether you come out of that room the same Toad\r\nthat you went in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took Toad firmly by the arm, led him into the smoking-room, and\r\nclosed the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That\xe2\x80\x99s_ no good!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9c_Talking_ to Toad\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever cure him. He\xe2\x80\x99ll _say_ anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey made themselves comfortable in armchairs and waited patiently.\r\nThrough the closed door they could just hear the long continuous drone\r\nof the Badger\xe2\x80\x99s voice, rising and falling in waves of oratory; and\r\npresently they noticed that the sermon began to be punctuated at\r\nintervals by long-drawn sobs, evidently proceeding from the bosom of\r\nToad, who was a soft-hearted and affectionate fellow, very easily\r\nconverted\xe2\x80\x94for the time being\xe2\x80\x94to any point of view.\r\n\r\nAfter some three-quarters of an hour the door opened, and the Badger\r\nreappeared, solemnly leading by the paw a very limp and dejected Toad.\r\nHis skin hung baggily about him, his legs wobbled, and his cheeks were\r\nfurrowed by the tears so plentifully called forth by the Badger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoving discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down there, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger kindly, pointing to a chair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI am pleased to inform you that Toad has at\r\nlast seen the error of his ways. He is truly sorry for his misguided\r\nconduct in the past, and he has undertaken to give up motor-cars\r\nentirely and for ever. I have his solemn promise to that effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very good news,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good news indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Rat dubiously, \xe2\x80\x9cif only\xe2\x80\x94_if_\r\nonly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was looking very hard at Toad as he said this, and could not help\r\nthinking he perceived something vaguely resembling a twinkle in that\r\nanimal\xe2\x80\x99s still sorrowful eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing more to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the gratified\r\nBadger. \xe2\x80\x9cToad, I want you solemnly to repeat, before your friends here,\r\nwhat you fully admitted to me in the smoking-room just now. First, you\r\nare sorry for what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and you see the folly of it all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a long, long pause. Toad looked desperately this way and\r\nthat, while the other animals waited in grave silence. At last he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, a little sullenly, but stoutly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m _not_ sorry. And it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t folly at all! It was simply glorious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Badger, greatly scandalised. \xe2\x80\x9cYou backsliding animal,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me just now, in there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes, in _there_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have said\r\nanything in _there_. You\xe2\x80\x99re so eloquent, dear Badger, and so moving,\r\nand so convincing, and put all your points so frightfully well\xe2\x80\x94you can\r\ndo what you like with me in _there_, and you know it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nsearching my mind since, and going over things in it, and I find that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit sorry or repentant really, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no earthly good saying\r\nI am; now, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, \xe2\x80\x9cnever to touch a motor-car\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Toad emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I\r\nfaithfully promise that the very first motor-car I see, poop-poop! off\r\nI go in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold you so, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Rat to the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger firmly, rising to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cSince\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t yield to persuasion, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try what force can do. I feared it\r\nwould come to this all along. You\xe2\x80\x99ve often asked us three to come and\r\nstay with you, Toad, in this handsome house of yours; well, now we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing to. When we\xe2\x80\x99ve converted you to a proper point of view we may\r\nquit, but not before. Take him upstairs, you two, and lock him up in\r\nhis bedroom, while we arrange matters between ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for your own good, Toady, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat kindly, as\r\nToad, kicking and struggling, was hauled up the stairs by his two\r\nfaithful friends. \xe2\x80\x9cThink what fun we shall all have together, just as\r\nwe used to, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve quite got over this\xe2\x80\x94this painful attack of\r\nyours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll take great care of everything for you till you\xe2\x80\x99re well, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Mole; \xe2\x80\x9cand we\xe2\x80\x99ll see your money isn\xe2\x80\x99t wasted, as it has been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more of those regrettable incidents with the police, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Rat, as they thrust him into his bedroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no more weeks in hospital, being ordered about by female nurses,\r\nToad,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Mole, turning the key on him.\r\n\r\nThey descended the stair, Toad shouting abuse at them through the\r\nkeyhole; and the three friends then met in conference on the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tedious business,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, sighing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever seen Toad so determined. However, we will see it out. He must\r\nnever be left an instant unguarded. We shall have to take it in turns\r\nto be with him, till the poison has worked itself out of his system.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey arranged watches accordingly. Each animal took it in turns to\r\nsleep in Toad\xe2\x80\x99s room at night, and they divided the day up between\r\nthem. At first Toad was undoubtedly very trying to his careful\r\nguardians. When his violent paroxysms possessed him he would arrange\r\nbedroom chairs in rude resemblance of a motor-car and would crouch on\r\nthe foremost of them, bent forward and staring fixedly ahead, making\r\nuncouth and ghastly noises, till the climax was reached, when, turning\r\na complete somersault, he would lie prostrate amidst the ruins of the\r\nchairs, apparently completely satisfied for the moment. As time passed,\r\nhowever, these painful seizures grew gradually less frequent, and his\r\nfriends strove to divert his mind into fresh channels. But his interest\r\nin other matters did not seem to revive, and he grew apparently languid\r\nand depressed.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning the Rat, whose turn it was to go on duty, went\r\nupstairs to relieve Badger, whom he found fidgeting to be off and\r\nstretch his legs in a long ramble round his wood and down his earths\r\nand burrows. \xe2\x80\x9cToad\xe2\x80\x99s still in bed,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Rat, outside the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t get much out of him, except, \xe2\x80\x98O leave him alone, he wants\r\nnothing, perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll be better presently, it may pass off in time,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be unduly anxious,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on. Now, you look out, Rat! When\r\nToad\xe2\x80\x99s quiet and submissive and playing at being the hero of a\r\nSunday-school prize, then he\xe2\x80\x99s at his artfullest. There\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be\r\nsomething up. I know him. Well, now, I must be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you to-day, old chap?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Rat cheerfully, as he\r\napproached Toad\xe2\x80\x99s bedside.\r\n\r\nHe had to wait some minutes for an answer. At last a feeble voice\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you so much, dear Ratty! So good of you to inquire! But\r\nfirst tell me how you are yourself, and the excellent Mole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, _we\xe2\x80\x99re_ all right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cMole,\xe2\x80\x9d he added incautiously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis going out for a run round with Badger. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be out till luncheon\r\ntime, so you and I will spend a pleasant morning together, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nmy best to amuse you. Now jump up, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow, and don\xe2\x80\x99t lie\r\nmoping there on a fine morning like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, kind Rat,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Toad, \xe2\x80\x9chow little you realise my condition,\r\nand how very far I am from \xe2\x80\x98jumping up\xe2\x80\x99 now\xe2\x80\x94if ever! But do not trouble\r\nabout me. I hate being a burden to my friends, and I do not expect to\r\nbe one much longer. Indeed, I almost hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope not, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a fine\r\nbother to us all this time, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear it\xe2\x80\x99s going to stop.\r\nAnd in weather like this, and the boating season just beginning! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo bad of you, Toad! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the trouble we mind, but you\xe2\x80\x99re making\r\nus miss such an awful lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it _is_ the trouble you mind, though,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Toad\r\nlanguidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can quite understand it. It\xe2\x80\x99s natural enough. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntired of bothering about me. I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to do anything further.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a nuisance, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99d take any trouble\r\non earth for you, if only you\xe2\x80\x99d be a sensible animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I thought that, Ratty,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Toad, more feebly than ever, \xe2\x80\x9cthen\r\nI would beg you\xe2\x80\x94for the last time, probably\xe2\x80\x94to step round to the\r\nvillage as quickly as possible\xe2\x80\x94even now it may be too late\xe2\x80\x94and fetch\r\nthe doctor. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you bother. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a trouble, and perhaps we\r\nmay as well let things take their course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you want a doctor for?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Rat, coming closer\r\nand examining him. He certainly lay very still and flat, and his voice\r\nwas weaker and his manner much changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you have noticed of late\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Toad. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, no\xe2\x80\x94why should\r\nyou? Noticing things is only a trouble. To-morrow, indeed, you may be\r\nsaying to yourself, \xe2\x80\x98O, if only I had noticed sooner! If only I had\r\ndone something!\xe2\x80\x99 But no; it\xe2\x80\x99s a trouble. Never mind\xe2\x80\x94forget that I\r\nasked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, beginning to get rather alarmed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cof course I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch a doctor to you, if you really think you want\r\nhim. But you can hardly be bad enough for that yet. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about\r\nsomething else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear, dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, with a sad smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xe2\x80\x98talk\xe2\x80\x99 can do\r\nlittle in a case like this\xe2\x80\x94or doctors either, for that matter; still,\r\none must grasp at the slightest straw. And, by the way\xe2\x80\x94while you are\r\nabout it\xe2\x80\x94I _hate_ to give you additional trouble, but I happen to\r\nremember that you will pass the door\xe2\x80\x94would you mind at the same time\r\nasking the lawyer to step up? It would be a convenience to me, and\r\nthere are moments\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I should say there is _a_ moment\xe2\x80\x94when one\r\nmust face disagreeable tasks, at whatever cost to exhausted nature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lawyer! O, he must be really bad!\xe2\x80\x9d the affrighted Rat said to\r\nhimself, as he hurried from the room, not forgetting, however, to lock\r\nthe door carefully behind him.\r\n\r\nOutside, he stopped to consider. The other two were far away, and he\r\nhad no one to consult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s best to be on the safe side,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, on reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known\r\nToad fancy himself frightfully bad before, without the slightest\r\nreason; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard him ask for a lawyer! If there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nreally the matter, the doctor will tell him he\xe2\x80\x99s an old ass, and cheer\r\nhim up; and that will be something gained. I\xe2\x80\x99d better humour him and\r\ngo; it won\xe2\x80\x99t take very long.\xe2\x80\x9d So he ran off to the village on his\r\nerrand of mercy.\r\n\r\nThe Toad, who had hopped lightly out of bed as soon as he heard the key\r\nturned in the lock, watched him eagerly from the window till he\r\ndisappeared down the carriage-drive. Then, laughing heartily, he\r\ndressed as quickly as possible in the smartest suit he could lay hands\r\non at the moment, filled his pockets with cash which he took from a\r\nsmall drawer in the dressing-table, and next, knotting the sheets from\r\nhis bed together and tying one end of the improvised rope round the\r\ncentral mullion of the handsome Tudor window which formed such a\r\nfeature of his bedroom, he scrambled out, slid lightly to the ground,\r\nand, taking the opposite direction to the Rat, marched off\r\nlightheartedly, whistling a merry tune.\r\n\r\nIt was a gloomy luncheon for Rat when the Badger and the Mole at length\r\nreturned, and he had to face them at table with his pitiful and\r\nunconvincing story. The Badger\xe2\x80\x99s caustic, not to say brutal, remarks\r\nmay be imagined, and therefore passed over; but it was painful to the\r\nRat that even the Mole, though he took his friend\xe2\x80\x99s side as far as\r\npossible, could not help saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a bit of a duffer this\r\ntime, Ratty! Toad, too, of all animals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did it awfully well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the crestfallen Rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did _you_ awfully well!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Badger hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\r\ntalking won\xe2\x80\x99t mend matters. He\xe2\x80\x99s got clear away for the time, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncertain; and the worst of it is, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be so conceited with what he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthink is his cleverness that he may commit any folly. One comfort is,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re free now, and needn\xe2\x80\x99t waste any more of our precious time doing\r\nsentry-go. But we\xe2\x80\x99d better continue to sleep at Toad Hall for a while\r\nlonger. Toad may be brought back at any moment\xe2\x80\x94on a stretcher, or\r\nbetween two policemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke the Badger, not knowing what the future held in store, or how\r\nmuch water, and of how turbid a character, was to run under bridges\r\nbefore Toad should sit at ease again in his ancestral Hall.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Toad, gay and irresponsible, was walking briskly along the\r\nhigh road, some miles from home. At first he had taken by-paths, and\r\ncrossed many fields, and changed his course several times, in case of\r\npursuit; but now, feeling by this time safe from recapture, and the sun\r\nsmiling brightly on him, and all Nature joining in a chorus of approval\r\nto the song of self-praise that his own heart was singing to him, he\r\nalmost danced along the road in his satisfaction and conceit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart piece of work that!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked to himself chuckling. \xe2\x80\x9cBrain\r\nagainst brute force\xe2\x80\x94and brain came out on the top\xe2\x80\x94as it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to do.\r\nPoor old Ratty! My! won\xe2\x80\x99t he catch it when the Badger gets back! A\r\nworthy fellow, Ratty, with many good qualities, but very little\r\nintelligence and absolutely no education. I must take him in hand some\r\nday, and see if I can make something of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFilled full of conceited thoughts such as these he strode along, his\r\nhead in the air, till he reached a little town, where the sign of \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nRed Lion,\xe2\x80\x9d swinging across the road halfway down the main street,\r\nreminded him that he had not breakfasted that day, and that he was\r\nexceedingly hungry after his long walk. He marched into the Inn,\r\nordered the best luncheon that could be provided at so short a notice,\r\nand sat down to eat it in the coffee-room.\r\n\r\nHe was about half-way through his meal when an only too familiar sound,\r\napproaching down the street, made him start and fall a-trembling all\r\nover. The poop-poop! drew nearer and nearer, the car could be heard to\r\nturn into the inn-yard and come to a stop, and Toad had to hold on to\r\nthe leg of the table to conceal his over-mastering emotion. Presently\r\nthe party entered the coffee-room, hungry, talkative, and gay, voluble\r\non their experiences of the morning and the merits of the chariot that\r\nhad brought them along so well. Toad listened eagerly, all ears, for a\r\ntime; at last he could stand it no longer. He slipped out of the room\r\nquietly, paid his bill at the bar, and as soon as he got outside\r\nsauntered round quietly to the inn-yard. \xe2\x80\x9cThere cannot be any harm,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cin my only just _looking_ at it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe car stood in the middle of the yard, quite unattended, the\r\nstable-helps and other hangers-on being all at their dinner. Toad\r\nwalked slowly round it, inspecting, criticising, musing deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself presently, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if this sort of car\r\n_starts_ easily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found he had hold of\r\nthe handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the\r\nold passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul.\r\nAs if in a dream he found himself, somehow, seated in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseat; as if in a dream, he pulled the lever and swung the car round the\r\nyard and out through the archway; and, as if in a dream, all sense of\r\nright and wrong, all fear of obvious consequences, seemed temporarily\r\nsuspended. He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street\r\nand leapt forth on the high road through the open country, he was only\r\nconscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest,\r\nToad the terror, the traffic-queller, the Lord of the lone trail,\r\nbefore whom all must give way or be smitten into nothingness and\r\neverlasting night. He chanted as he flew, and the car responded with\r\nsonorous drone; the miles were eaten up under him as he sped he knew\r\nnot whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of\r\nwhat might come to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Chairman of the Bench of Magistrates\r\ncheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthe _only_ difficulty that presents itself in this\r\notherwise very clear case is, how we can possibly make it sufficiently\r\nhot for the incorrigible rogue and hardened ruffian whom we see\r\ncowering in the dock before us. Let me see: he has been found guilty,\r\non the clearest evidence, first, of stealing a valuable motor-car;\r\nsecondly, of driving to the public danger; and, thirdly, of gross\r\nimpertinence to the rural police. Mr. Clerk, will you tell us, please,\r\nwhat is the very stiffest penalty we can impose for each of these\r\noffences? Without, of course, giving the prisoner the benefit of any\r\ndoubt, because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Clerk scratched his nose with his pen. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people would\r\nconsider,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat stealing the motor-car was the worst\r\noffence; and so it is. But cheeking the police undoubtedly carries the\r\nseverest penalty; and so it ought. Supposing you were to say twelve\r\nmonths for the theft, which is mild; and three years for the furious\r\ndriving, which is lenient; and fifteen years for the cheek, which was\r\npretty bad sort of cheek, judging by what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the\r\nwitness-box, even if you only believe one-tenth part of what you heard,\r\nand I never believe more myself\xe2\x80\x94those figures, if added together\r\ncorrectly, tot up to nineteen years\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst-rate!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chairman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94So you had better make it a round twenty years and be on the safe\r\nside,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the Clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn excellent suggestion!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chairman approvingly. \xe2\x80\x9cPrisoner!\r\nPull yourself together and try and stand up straight. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be\r\ntwenty years for you this time. And mind, if you appear before us\r\nagain, upon any charge whatever, we shall have to deal with you very\r\nseriously!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the brutal minions of the law fell upon the hapless Toad; loaded\r\nhim with chains, and dragged him from the Court House, shrieking,\r\npraying, protesting; across the marketplace, where the playful\r\npopulace, always as severe upon detected crime as they are sympathetic\r\nand helpful when one is merely \xe2\x80\x9cwanted,\xe2\x80\x9d assailed him with jeers,\r\ncarrots, and popular catch-words; past hooting school children, their\r\ninnocent faces lit up with the pleasure they ever derive from the sight\r\nof a gentleman in difficulties; across the hollow-sounding drawbridge,\r\nbelow the spiky portcullis, under the frowning archway of the grim old\r\ncastle, whose ancient towers soared high overhead; past guardrooms full\r\nof grinning soldiery off duty, past sentries who coughed in a horrid,\r\nsarcastic way, because that is as much as a sentry on his post dare do\r\nto show his contempt and abhorrence of crime; up time-worn winding\r\nstairs, past men-at-arms in casquet and corselet of steel, darting\r\nthreatening looks through their vizards; across courtyards, where\r\nmastiffs strained at their leash and pawed the air to get at him; past\r\nancient warders, their halberds leant against the wall, dozing over a\r\npasty and a flagon of brown ale; on and on, past the rack-chamber and\r\nthe thumbscrew-room, past the turning that led to the private scaffold,\r\ntill they reached the door of the grimmest dungeon that lay in the\r\nheart of the innermost keep. There at last they paused, where an\r\nancient gaoler sat fingering a bunch of mighty keys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOddsbodikins!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant of police, taking off his helmet and\r\nwiping his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cRouse thee, old loon, and take over from us this\r\nvile Toad, a criminal of deepest guilt and matchless artfulness and\r\nresource. Watch and ward him with all thy skill; and mark thee well,\r\ngreybeard, should aught untoward befall, thy old head shall answer for\r\nhis\xe2\x80\x94and a murrain on both of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gaoler nodded grimly, laying his withered hand on the shoulder of\r\nthe miserable Toad. The rusty key creaked in the lock, the great door\r\nclanged behind them; and Toad was a helpless prisoner in the remotest\r\ndungeon of the best-guarded keep of the stoutest castle in all the\r\nlength and breadth of Merry England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nTHE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Willow-Wren was twittering his thin little song, hidden himself in\r\nthe dark selvedge of the river bank. Though it was past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at\r\nnight, the sky still clung to and retained some lingering skirts of\r\nlight from the departed day; and the sullen heats of the torrid\r\nafternoon broke up and rolled away at the dispersing touch of the cool\r\nfingers of the short midsummer night. Mole lay stretched on the bank,\r\nstill panting from the stress of the fierce day that had been cloudless\r\nfrom dawn to late sunset, and waited for his friend to return. He had\r\nbeen on the river with some companions, leaving the Water Rat free to\r\nkeep a engagement of long standing with Otter; and he had come back to\r\nfind the house dark and deserted, and no sign of Rat, who was doubtless\r\nkeeping it up late with his old comrade. It was still too hot to think\r\nof staying indoors, so he lay on some cool dock-leaves, and thought\r\nover the past day and its doings, and how very good they all had been.\r\n\r\nThe Rat\xe2\x80\x99s light footfall was presently heard approaching over the\r\nparched grass. \xe2\x80\x9cO, the blessed coolness!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and sat down, gazing\r\nthoughtfully into the river, silent and pre-occupied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stayed to supper, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply had to,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of my going before.\r\nYou know how kind they always are. And they made things as jolly for me\r\nas ever they could, right up to the moment I left. But I felt a brute\r\nall the time, as it was clear to me they were very unhappy, though they\r\ntried to hide it. Mole, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid they\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble. Little Portly is\r\nmissing again; and you know what a lot his father thinks of him, though\r\nhe never says much about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, that child?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, suppose he is; why\r\nworry about it? He\xe2\x80\x99s always straying off and getting lost, and turning\r\nup again; he\xe2\x80\x99s so adventurous. But no harm ever happens to him.\r\nEverybody hereabouts knows him and likes him, just as they do old\r\nOtter, and you may be sure some animal or other will come across him\r\nand bring him back again all right. Why, we\xe2\x80\x99ve found him ourselves,\r\nmiles from home, and quite self-possessed and cheerful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but this time it\xe2\x80\x99s more serious,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen missing for some days now, and the Otters have hunted everywhere,\r\nhigh and low, without finding the slightest trace. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve asked\r\nevery animal, too, for miles around, and no one knows anything about\r\nhim. Otter\xe2\x80\x99s evidently more anxious than he\xe2\x80\x99ll admit. I got out of him\r\nthat young Portly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t learnt to swim very well yet, and I can see\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of the weir. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of water coming down still,\r\nconsidering the time of the year, and the place always had a\r\nfascination for the child. And then there are\xe2\x80\x94well, traps and\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94_you_ know. Otter\xe2\x80\x99s not the fellow to be nervous about any son\r\nof his before it\xe2\x80\x99s time. And now he _is_ nervous. When I left, he came\r\nout with me\xe2\x80\x94said he wanted some air, and talked about stretching his\r\nlegs. But I could see it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that, so I drew him out and pumped him,\r\nand got it all from him at last. He was going to spend the night\r\nwatching by the ford. You know the place where the old ford used to be,\r\nin by-gone days before they built the bridge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why should Otter choose to watch\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it seems that it was there he gave Portly his first\r\nswimming-lesson,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom that shallow, gravelly spit\r\nnear the bank. And it was there he used to teach him fishing, and there\r\nyoung Portly caught his first fish, of which he was so very proud. The\r\nchild loved the spot, and Otter thinks that if he came wandering back\r\nfrom wherever he is\xe2\x80\x94if he _is_ anywhere by this time, poor little\r\nchap\xe2\x80\x94he might make for the ford he was so fond of; or if he came across\r\nit he\xe2\x80\x99d remember it well, and stop there and play, perhaps. So Otter\r\ngoes there every night and watches\xe2\x80\x94on the chance, you know, just on the\r\nchance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a time, both thinking of the same thing\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlonely, heart-sore animal, crouched by the ford, watching and waiting,\r\nthe long night through\xe2\x80\x94on the chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat presently, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we ought to be\r\nthinking about turning in.\xe2\x80\x9d But he never offered to move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, \xe2\x80\x9cI simply can\xe2\x80\x99t go and turn in, and go to sleep,\r\nand _do_ nothing, even though there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be anything to be\r\ndone. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get the boat out, and paddle up stream. The moon will be up\r\nin an hour or so, and then we will search as well as we can\xe2\x80\x94anyhow, it\r\nwill be better than going to bed and doing _nothing_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what I was thinking myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the sort of\r\nnight for bed anyhow; and daybreak is not so very far off, and then we\r\nmay pick up some news of him from early risers as we go along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey got the boat out, and the Rat took the sculls, paddling with\r\ncaution. Out in midstream, there was a clear, narrow track that faintly\r\nreflected the sky; but wherever shadows fell on the water from bank,\r\nbush, or tree, they were as solid to all appearance as the banks\r\nthemselves, and the Mole had to steer with judgment accordingly. Dark\r\nand deserted as it was, the night was full of small noises, song and\r\nchatter and rustling, telling of the busy little population who were up\r\nand about, plying their trades and vocations through the night till\r\nsunshine should fall on them at last and send them off to their\r\nwell-earned repose. The water\xe2\x80\x99s own noises, too, were more apparent\r\nthan by day, its gurglings and \xe2\x80\x9ccloops\xe2\x80\x9d more unexpected and near at\r\nhand; and constantly they started at what seemed a sudden clear call\r\nfrom an actual articulate voice.\r\n\r\nThe line of the horizon was clear and hard against the sky, and in one\r\nparticular quarter it showed black against a silvery climbing\r\nphosphorescence that grew and grew. At last, over the rim of the\r\nwaiting earth the moon lifted with slow majesty till it swung clear of\r\nthe horizon and rode off, free of moorings; and once more they began to\r\nsee surfaces\xe2\x80\x94meadows wide-spread, and quiet gardens, and the river\r\nitself from bank to bank, all softly disclosed, all washed clean of\r\nmystery and terror, all radiant again as by day, but with a difference\r\nthat was tremendous. Their old haunts greeted them again in other\r\nraiment, as if they had slipped away and put on this pure new apparel\r\nand come quietly back, smiling as they shyly waited to see if they\r\nwould be recognised again under it.\r\n\r\nFastening their boat to a willow, the friends landed in this silent,\r\nsilver kingdom, and patiently explored the hedges, the hollow trees,\r\nthe runnels and their little culverts, the ditches and dry water-ways.\r\nEmbarking again and crossing over, they worked their way up the stream\r\nin this manner, while the moon, serene and detached in a cloudless sky,\r\ndid what she could, though so far off, to help them in their quest;\r\ntill her hour came and she sank earthwards reluctantly, and left them,\r\nand mystery once more held field and river.\r\n\r\nThen a change began slowly to declare itself. The horizon became\r\nclearer, field and tree came more into sight, and somehow with a\r\ndifferent look; the mystery began to drop away from them. A bird piped\r\nsuddenly, and was still; and a light breeze sprang up and set the reeds\r\nand bulrushes rustling. Rat, who was in the stern of the boat, while\r\nMole sculled, sat up suddenly and listened with a passionate\r\nintentness. Mole, who with gentle strokes was just keeping the boat\r\nmoving while he scanned the banks with care, looked at him with\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gone!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the Rat, sinking back in his seat again. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nbeautiful and strange and new. Since it was to end so soon, I almost\r\nwish I had never heard it. For it has roused a longing in me that is\r\npain, and nothing seems worth while but just to hear that sound once\r\nmore and go on listening to it for ever. No! There it is again!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, alert once more. Entranced, he was silent for a long space,\r\nspellbound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it passes on and I begin to lose it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently. \xe2\x80\x9cO Mole!\r\nthe beauty of it! The merry bubble and joy, the thin, clear, happy call\r\nof the distant piping! Such music I never dreamed of, and the call in\r\nit is stronger even than the music is sweet! Row on, Mole, row! For the\r\nmusic and the call must be for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole, greatly wondering, obeyed. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear nothing myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut the wind playing in the reeds and rushes and osiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat never answered, if indeed he heard. Rapt, transported,\r\ntrembling, he was possessed in all his senses by this new divine thing\r\nthat caught up his helpless soul and swung and dandled it, a powerless\r\nbut happy infant in a strong sustaining grasp.\r\n\r\nIn silence Mole rowed steadily, and soon they came to a point where the\r\nriver divided, a long backwater branching off to one side. With a\r\nslight movement of his head Rat, who had long dropped the rudder-lines,\r\ndirected the rower to take the backwater. The creeping tide of light\r\ngained and gained, and now they could see the colour of the flowers\r\nthat gemmed the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClearer and nearer still,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you must\r\nsurely hear it! Ah\xe2\x80\x94at last\xe2\x80\x94I see you do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBreathless and transfixed the Mole stopped rowing as the liquid run of\r\nthat glad piping broke on him like a wave, caught him up, and possessed\r\nhim utterly. He saw the tears on his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, and bowed his\r\nhead and understood. For a space they hung there, brushed by the purple\r\nloose-strife that fringed the bank; then the clear imperious summons\r\nthat marched hand-in-hand with the intoxicating melody imposed its will\r\non Mole, and mechanically he bent to his oars again. And the light grew\r\nsteadily stronger, but no birds sang as they were wont to do at the\r\napproach of dawn; and but for the heavenly music all was marvellously\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nOn either side of them, as they glided onwards, the rich meadow-grass\r\nseemed that morning of a freshness and a greenness unsurpassable. Never\r\nhad they noticed the roses so vivid, the willow-herb so riotous, the\r\nmeadow-sweet so odorous and pervading. Then the murmur of the\r\napproaching weir began to hold the air, and they felt a consciousness\r\nthat they were nearing the end, whatever it might be, that surely\r\nawaited their expedition.\r\n\r\nA wide half-circle of foam and glinting lights and shining shoulders of\r\ngreen water, the great weir closed the backwater from bank to bank,\r\ntroubled all the quiet surface with twirling eddies and floating\r\nfoam-streaks, and deadened all other sounds with its solemn and\r\nsoothing rumble. In midmost of the stream, embraced in the weir\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshimmering arm-spread, a small island lay anchored, fringed close with\r\nwillow and silver birch and alder. Reserved, shy, but full of\r\nsignificance, it hid whatever it might hold behind a veil, keeping it\r\ntill the hour should come, and, with the hour, those who were called\r\nand chosen.\r\n\r\nSlowly, but with no doubt or hesitation whatever, and in something of a\r\nsolemn expectancy, the two animals passed through the broken tumultuous\r\nwater and moored their boat at the flowery margin of the island. In\r\nsilence they landed, and pushed through the blossom and scented herbage\r\nand undergrowth that led up to the level ground, till they stood on a\r\nlittle lawn of a marvellous green, set round with Nature\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\norchard-trees\xe2\x80\x94crab-apple, wild cherry, and sloe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the place of my song-dream, the place the music played to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhispered the Rat, as if in a trance. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, in this holy place, here\r\nif anywhere, surely we shall find Him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the Mole felt a great Awe fall upon him, an awe that\r\nturned his muscles to water, bowed his head, and rooted his feet to the\r\nground. It was no panic terror\xe2\x80\x94indeed he felt wonderfully at peace and\r\nhappy\xe2\x80\x94but it was an awe that smote and held him and, without seeing, he\r\nknew it could only mean that some august Presence was very, very near.\r\nWith difficulty he turned to look for his friend and saw him at his\r\nside cowed, stricken, and trembling violently. And still there was\r\nutter silence in the populous bird-haunted branches around them; and\r\nstill the light grew and grew.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he would never have dared to raise his eyes, but that, though\r\nthe piping was now hushed, the call and the summons seemed still\r\ndominant and imperious. He might not refuse, were Death himself waiting\r\nto strike him instantly, once he had looked with mortal eye on things\r\nrightly kept hidden. Trembling he obeyed, and raised his humble head;\r\nand then, in that utter clearness of the imminent dawn, while Nature,\r\nflushed with fullness of incredible colour, seemed to hold her breath\r\nfor the event, he looked in the very eyes of the Friend and Helper; saw\r\nthe backward sweep of the curved horns, gleaming in the growing\r\ndaylight; saw the stern, hooked nose between the kindly eyes that were\r\nlooking down on them humourously, while the bearded mouth broke into a\r\nhalf-smile at the corners; saw the rippling muscles on the arm that lay\r\nacross the broad chest, the long supple hand still holding the\r\npan-pipes only just fallen away from the parted lips; saw the splendid\r\ncurves of the shaggy limbs disposed in majestic ease on the sward; saw,\r\nlast of all, nestling between his very hooves, sleeping soundly in\r\nentire peace and contentment, the little, round, podgy, childish form\r\nof the baby otter. All this he saw, for one moment breathless and\r\nintense, vivid on the morning sky; and still, as he looked, he lived;\r\nand still, as he lived, he wondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRat!\xe2\x80\x9d he found breath to whisper, shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Rat, his eyes shining with unutterable love.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid! Of _Him?_ O, never, never! And yet\xe2\x80\x94and yet\xe2\x80\x94O, Mole, I am\r\nafraid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the two animals, crouching to the earth, bowed their heads and did\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nSudden and magnificent, the sun\xe2\x80\x99s broad golden disc showed itself over\r\nthe horizon facing them; and the first rays, shooting across the level\r\nwater-meadows, took the animals full in the eyes and dazzled them. When\r\nthey were able to look once more, the Vision had vanished, and the air\r\nwas full of the carol of birds that hailed the dawn.\r\n\r\nAs they stared blankly in dumb misery deepening as they slowly realised\r\nall they had seen and all they had lost, a capricious little breeze,\r\ndancing up from the surface of the water, tossed the aspens, shook the\r\ndewy roses and blew lightly and caressingly in their faces; and with\r\nits soft touch came instant oblivion. For this is the last best gift\r\nthat the kindly demi-god is careful to bestow on those to whom he has\r\nrevealed himself in their helping: the gift of forgetfulness. Lest the\r\nawful remembrance should remain and grow, and overshadow mirth and\r\npleasure, and the great haunting memory should spoil all the\r\nafter-lives of little animals helped out of difficulties, in order that\r\nthey should be happy and lighthearted as before.\r\n\r\nMole rubbed his eyes and stared at Rat, who was looking about him in a\r\npuzzled sort of way. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon; what did you say, Rat?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I was only remarking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rat slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this was the\r\nright sort of place, and that here, if anywhere, we should find him.\r\nAnd look! Why, there he is, the little fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d And with a cry of\r\ndelight he ran towards the slumbering Portly.\r\n\r\nBut Mole stood still a moment, held in thought. As one wakened suddenly\r\nfrom a beautiful dream, who struggles to recall it, and can re-capture\r\nnothing but a dim sense of the beauty of it, the beauty! Till that,\r\ntoo, fades away in its turn, and the dreamer bitterly accepts the hard,\r\ncold waking and all its penalties; so Mole, after struggling with his\r\nmemory for a brief space, shook his head sadly and followed the Rat.\r\n\r\nPortly woke up with a joyous squeak, and wriggled with pleasure at the\r\nsight of his father\xe2\x80\x99s friends, who had played with him so often in past\r\ndays. In a moment, however, his face grew blank, and he fell to hunting\r\nround in a circle with pleading whine. As a child that has fallen\r\nhappily asleep in its nurse\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and wakes to find itself alone and\r\nlaid in a strange place, and searches corners and cupboards, and runs\r\nfrom room to room, despair growing silently in its heart, even so\r\nPortly searched the island and searched, dogged and unwearying, till at\r\nlast the black moment came for giving it up, and sitting down and\r\ncrying bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe Mole ran quickly to comfort the little animal; but Rat, lingering,\r\nlooked long and doubtfully at certain hoof-marks deep in the sward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome\xe2\x80\x94great\xe2\x80\x94animal\xe2\x80\x94has been here,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured slowly and thoughtfully;\r\nand stood musing, musing; his mind strangely stirred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, Rat!\xe2\x80\x9d called the Mole. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of poor Otter, waiting up\r\nthere by the ford!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPortly had soon been comforted by the promise of a treat\xe2\x80\x94a jaunt on the\r\nriver in Mr. Rat\xe2\x80\x99s real boat; and the two animals conducted him to the\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x99s side, placed him securely between them in the bottom of the\r\nboat, and paddled off down the backwater. The sun was fully up by now,\r\nand hot on them, birds sang lustily and without restraint, and flowers\r\nsmiled and nodded from either bank, but somehow\xe2\x80\x94so thought the\r\nanimals\xe2\x80\x94with less of richness and blaze of colour than they seemed to\r\nremember seeing quite recently somewhere\xe2\x80\x94they wondered where.\r\n\r\nThe main river reached again, they turned the boat\xe2\x80\x99s head upstream,\r\ntowards the point where they knew their friend was keeping his lonely\r\nvigil. As they drew near the familiar ford, the Mole took the boat in\r\nto the bank, and they lifted Portly out and set him on his legs on the\r\ntow-path, gave him his marching orders and a friendly farewell pat on\r\nthe back, and shoved out into mid-stream. They watched the little\r\nanimal as he waddled along the path contentedly and with importance;\r\nwatched him till they saw his muzzle suddenly lift and his waddle break\r\ninto a clumsy amble as he quickened his pace with shrill whines and\r\nwriggles of recognition. Looking up the river, they could see Otter\r\nstart up, tense and rigid, from out of the shallows where he crouched\r\nin dumb patience, and could hear his amazed and joyous bark as he\r\nbounded up through the osiers on to the path. Then the Mole, with a\r\nstrong pull on one oar, swung the boat round and let the full stream\r\nbear them down again whither it would, their quest now happily ended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel strangely tired, Rat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, leaning wearily over his\r\noars as the boat drifted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s being up all night, you\xe2\x80\x99ll say,\r\nperhaps; but that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. We do as much half the nights of the week,\r\nat this time of the year. No; I feel as if I had been through something\r\nvery exciting and rather terrible, and it was just over; and yet\r\nnothing particular has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr something very surprising and splendid and beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the\r\nRat, leaning back and closing his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel just as you do, Mole;\r\nsimply dead tired, though not body tired. It\xe2\x80\x99s lucky we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the\r\nstream with us, to take us home. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it jolly to feel the sun again,\r\nsoaking into one\xe2\x80\x99s bones! And hark to the wind playing in the reeds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like music\xe2\x80\x94far away music,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole nodding drowsily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I was thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Rat, dreamful and languid.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDance-music\xe2\x80\x94the lilting sort that runs on without a stop\xe2\x80\x94but with\r\nwords in it, too\xe2\x80\x94it passes into words and out of them again\xe2\x80\x94I catch\r\nthem at intervals\xe2\x80\x94then it is dance-music once more, and then nothing\r\nbut the reeds\xe2\x80\x99 soft thin whispering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear better than I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot catch the\r\nwords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me try and give you them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat softly, his eyes still\r\nclosed. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it is turning into words again\xe2\x80\x94faint but clear\xe2\x80\x94_Lest the\r\nawe should dwell\xe2\x80\x94And turn your frolic to fret\xe2\x80\x94You shall look on my\r\npower at the helping hour\xe2\x80\x94But then you shall forget!_ Now the reeds\r\ntake it up\xe2\x80\x94_forget, forget_, they sigh, and it dies away in a rustle\r\nand a whisper. Then the voice returns\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Lest limbs be reddened and rent\xe2\x80\x94I spring the trap that is set\xe2\x80\x94As I\r\nloose the snare you may glimpse me there\xe2\x80\x94For surely you shall forget!_\r\nRow nearer, Mole, nearer to the reeds! It is hard to catch, and grows\r\neach minute fainter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Helper and healer, I cheer\xe2\x80\x94Small waifs in the woodland wet\xe2\x80\x94Strays I\r\nfind in it, wounds I bind in it\xe2\x80\x94Bidding them all forget!_ Nearer, Mole,\r\nnearer! No, it is no good; the song has died away into reed-talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do the words mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the wondering Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat simply. \xe2\x80\x9cI passed them on to you as\r\nthey reached me. Ah! now they return again, and this time full and\r\nclear! This time, at last, it is the real, the unmistakable thing,\r\nsimple\xe2\x80\x94passionate\xe2\x80\x94perfect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s have it, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, after he had waited\r\npatiently for a few minutes, half-dozing in the hot sun.\r\n\r\nBut no answer came. He looked, and understood the silence. With a smile\r\nof much happiness on his face, and something of a listening look still\r\nlingering there, the weary Rat was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nTOAD\xe2\x80\x99S ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Toad found himself immured in a dank and noisome dungeon, and knew\r\nthat all the grim darkness of a medieval fortress lay between him and\r\nthe outer world of sunshine and well-metalled high roads where he had\r\nlately been so happy, disporting himself as if he had bought up every\r\nroad in England, he flung himself at full length on the floor, and shed\r\nbitter tears, and abandoned himself to dark despair. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the end\r\nof everything\xe2\x80\x9d (he said), \xe2\x80\x9cat least it is the end of the career of\r\nToad, which is the same thing; the popular and handsome Toad, the rich\r\nand hospitable Toad, the Toad so free and careless and debonair! How\r\ncan I hope to be ever set at large again\xe2\x80\x9d (he said), \xe2\x80\x9cwho have been\r\nimprisoned so justly for stealing so handsome a motor-car in such an\r\naudacious manner, and for such lurid and imaginative cheek, bestowed\r\nupon such a number of fat, red-faced policemen!\xe2\x80\x9d (Here his sobs choked\r\nhim.) \xe2\x80\x9cStupid animal that I was\xe2\x80\x9d (he said), \xe2\x80\x9cnow I must languish in\r\nthis dungeon, till people who were proud to say they knew me, have\r\nforgotten the very name of Toad! O wise old Badger!\xe2\x80\x9d (he said), \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nclever, intelligent Rat and sensible Mole! What sound judgments, what a\r\nknowledge of men and matters you possess! O unhappy and forsaken Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWith lamentations such as these he passed his days and nights for\r\nseveral weeks, refusing his meals or intermediate light refreshments,\r\nthough the grim and ancient gaoler, knowing that Toad\xe2\x80\x99s pockets were\r\nwell lined, frequently pointed out that many comforts, and indeed\r\nluxuries, could by arrangement be sent in\xe2\x80\x94at a price\xe2\x80\x94from outside.\r\n\r\nNow the gaoler had a daughter, a pleasant wench and good-hearted, who\r\nassisted her father in the lighter duties of his post. She was\r\nparticularly fond of animals, and, besides her canary, whose cage hung\r\non a nail in the massive wall of the keep by day, to the great\r\nannoyance of prisoners who relished an after-dinner nap, and was\r\nshrouded in an antimacassar on the parlour table at night, she kept\r\nseveral piebald mice and a restless revolving squirrel. This\r\nkind-hearted girl, pitying the misery of Toad, said to her father one\r\nday, \xe2\x80\x9cFather! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see that poor beast so unhappy, and\r\ngetting so thin! You let me have the managing of him. You know how fond\r\nof animals I am. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make him eat from my hand, and sit up, and do all\r\nsorts of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father replied that she could do what she liked with him. He was\r\ntired of Toad, and his sulks and his airs and his meanness. So that day\r\nshe went on her errand of mercy, and knocked at the door of Toad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, cheer up, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, coaxingly, on entering, \xe2\x80\x9cand sit up\r\nand dry your eyes and be a sensible animal. And do try and eat a bit of\r\ndinner. See, I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you some of mine, hot from the oven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was bubble-and-squeak, between two plates, and its fragrance filled\r\nthe narrow cell. The penetrating smell of cabbage reached the nose of\r\nToad as he lay prostrate in his misery on the floor, and gave him the\r\nidea for a moment that perhaps life was not such a blank and desperate\r\nthing as he had imagined. But still he wailed, and kicked with his\r\nlegs, and refused to be comforted. So the wise girl retired for the\r\ntime, but, of course, a good deal of the smell of hot cabbage remained\r\nbehind, as it will do, and Toad, between his sobs, sniffed and\r\nreflected, and gradually began to think new and inspiring thoughts: of\r\nchivalry, and poetry, and deeds still to be done; of broad meadows, and\r\ncattle browsing in them, raked by sun and wind; of kitchen-gardens, and\r\nstraight herb-borders, and warm snap-dragon beset by bees; and of the\r\ncomforting clink of dishes set down on the table at Toad Hall, and the\r\nscrape of chair-legs on the floor as every one pulled himself close up\r\nto his work. The air of the narrow cell took a rosy tinge; he began to\r\nthink of his friends, and how they would surely be able to do\r\nsomething; of lawyers, and how they would have enjoyed his case, and\r\nwhat an ass he had been not to get in a few; and lastly, he thought of\r\nhis own great cleverness and resource, and all that he was capable of\r\nif he only gave his great mind to it; and the cure was almost complete.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl returned, some hours later, she carried a tray, with a\r\ncup of fragrant tea steaming on it; and a plate piled up with very hot\r\nbuttered toast, cut thick, very brown on both sides, with the butter\r\nrunning through the holes in it in great golden drops, like honey from\r\nthe honeycomb. The smell of that buttered toast simply talked to Toad,\r\nand with no uncertain voice; talked of warm kitchens, of breakfasts on\r\nbright frosty mornings, of cosy parlour firesides on winter evenings,\r\nwhen one\xe2\x80\x99s ramble was over and slippered feet were propped on the\r\nfender; of the purring of contented cats, and the twitter of sleepy\r\ncanaries. Toad sat up on end once more, dried his eyes, sipped his tea\r\nand munched his toast, and soon began talking freely about himself, and\r\nthe house he lived in, and his doings there, and how important he was,\r\nand what a lot his friends thought of him.\r\n\r\nThe gaoler\xe2\x80\x99s daughter saw that the topic was doing him as much good as\r\nthe tea, as indeed it was, and encouraged him to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about Toad Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Toad proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cis an eligible self-contained\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s residence very unique; dating in part from the fourteenth\r\ncentury, but replete with every modern convenience. Up-to-date\r\nsanitation. Five minutes from church, post-office, and golf-links,\r\nSuitable for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless the animal,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to _take_\r\nit. Tell me something _real_ about it. But first wait till I fetch you\r\nsome more tea and toast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tripped away, and presently returned with a fresh trayful; and\r\nToad, pitching into the toast with avidity, his spirits quite restored\r\nto their usual level, told her about the boathouse, and the fish-pond,\r\nand the old walled kitchen-garden; and about the pig-styes, and the\r\nstables, and the pigeon-house, and the hen-house; and about the dairy,\r\nand the wash-house, and the china-cupboards, and the linen-presses (she\r\nliked that bit especially); and about the banqueting-hall, and the fun\r\nthey had there when the other animals were gathered round the table and\r\nToad was at his best, singing songs, telling stories, carrying on\r\ngenerally. Then she wanted to know about his animal-friends, and was\r\nvery interested in all he had to tell her about them and how they\r\nlived, and what they did to pass their time. Of course, she did not say\r\nshe was fond of animals as _pets_, because she had the sense to see\r\nthat Toad would be extremely offended. When she said good night, having\r\nfilled his water-jug and shaken up his straw for him, Toad was very\r\nmuch the same sanguine, self-satisfied animal that he had been of old.\r\nHe sang a little song or two, of the sort he used to sing at his\r\ndinner-parties, curled himself up in the straw, and had an excellent\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s rest and the pleasantest of dreams.\r\n\r\nThey had many interesting talks together, after that, as the dreary\r\ndays went on; and the gaoler\xe2\x80\x99s daughter grew very sorry for Toad, and\r\nthought it a great shame that a poor little animal should be locked up\r\nin prison for what seemed to her a very trivial offence. Toad, of\r\ncourse, in his vanity, thought that her interest in him proceeded from\r\na growing tenderness; and he could not help half-regretting that the\r\nsocial gulf between them was so very wide, for she was a comely lass,\r\nand evidently admired him very much.\r\n\r\nOne morning the girl was very thoughtful, and answered at random, and\r\ndid not seem to Toad to be paying proper attention to his witty sayings\r\nand sparkling comments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said presently, \xe2\x80\x9cjust listen, please. I have an aunt who is\r\na washerwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, graciously and affably, \xe2\x80\x9cnever mind; think\r\nno more about it. _I_ have several aunts who _ought_ to be\r\nwasherwomen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo be quiet a minute, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk too much, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour chief fault, and I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think, and you hurt my head. As I\r\nsaid, I have an aunt who is a washerwoman; she does the washing for all\r\nthe prisoners in this castle\xe2\x80\x94we try to keep any paying business of that\r\nsort in the family, you understand. She takes out the washing on Monday\r\nmorning, and brings it in on Friday evening. This is a Thursday. Now,\r\nthis is what occurs to me: you\xe2\x80\x99re very rich\xe2\x80\x94at least you\xe2\x80\x99re always\r\ntelling me so\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99s very poor. A few pounds wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make any\r\ndifference to you, and it would mean a lot to her. Now, I think if she\r\nwere properly approached\xe2\x80\x94squared, I believe is the word you animals\r\nuse\xe2\x80\x94you could come to some arrangement by which she would let you have\r\nher dress and bonnet and so on, and you could escape from the castle as\r\nthe official washerwoman. You\xe2\x80\x99re very alike in many\r\nrespects\xe2\x80\x94particularly about the figure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re _not_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Toad in a huff. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a very elegant\r\nfigure\xe2\x80\x94for what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo has my aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cfor what _she_ is. But have it\r\nyour own way. You horrid, proud, ungrateful animal, when I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for\r\nyou, and trying to help you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right; thank you very much indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Toad\r\nhurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut look here! you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surely have Mr. Toad of Toad\r\nHall, going about the country disguised as a washerwoman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you can stop here as a Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl with much spirit.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you want to go off in a coach-and-four!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHonest Toad was always ready to admit himself in the wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a\r\ngood, kind, clever girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am indeed a proud and a\r\nstupid toad. Introduce me to your worthy aunt, if you will be so kind,\r\nand I have no doubt that the excellent lady and I will be able to\r\narrange terms satisfactory to both parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext evening the girl ushered her aunt into Toad\xe2\x80\x99s cell, bearing his\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s washing pinned up in a towel. The old lady had been prepared\r\nbeforehand for the interview, and the sight of certain gold sovereigns\r\nthat Toad had thoughtfully placed on the table in full view practically\r\ncompleted the matter and left little further to discuss. In return for\r\nhis cash, Toad received a cotton print gown, an apron, a shawl, and a\r\nrusty black bonnet; the only stipulation the old lady made being that\r\nshe should be gagged and bound and dumped down in a corner. By this not\r\nvery convincing artifice, she explained, aided by picturesque fiction\r\nwhich she could supply herself, she hoped to retain her situation, in\r\nspite of the suspicious appearance of things.\r\n\r\nToad was delighted with the suggestion. It would enable him to leave\r\nthe prison in some style, and with his reputation for being a desperate\r\nand dangerous fellow untarnished; and he readily helped the gaoler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter to make her aunt appear as much as possible the victim of\r\ncircumstances over which she had no control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cTake off that coat and\r\nwaistcoat of yours; you\xe2\x80\x99re fat enough as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShaking with laughter, she proceeded to \xe2\x80\x9chook-and-eye\xe2\x80\x9d him into the\r\ncotton print gown, arranged the shawl with a professional fold, and\r\ntied the strings of the rusty bonnet under his chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the very image of her,\xe2\x80\x9d she giggled, \xe2\x80\x9conly I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you never\r\nlooked half so respectable in all your life before. Now, good-bye,\r\nToad, and good luck. Go straight down the way you came up; and if any\r\none says anything to you, as they probably will, being but men, you can\r\nchaff back a bit, of course, but remember you\xe2\x80\x99re a widow woman, quite\r\nalone in the world, with a character to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a quaking heart, but as firm a footstep as he could command, Toad\r\nset forth cautiously on what seemed to be a most hare-brained and\r\nhazardous undertaking; but he was soon agreeably surprised to find how\r\neasy everything was made for him, and a little humbled at the thought\r\nthat both his popularity, and the sex that seemed to inspire it, were\r\nreally another\xe2\x80\x99s. The washerwoman\xe2\x80\x99s squat figure in its familiar cotton\r\nprint seemed a passport for every barred door and grim gateway; even\r\nwhen he hesitated, uncertain as to the right turning to take, he found\r\nhimself helped out of his difficulty by the warder at the next gate,\r\nanxious to be off to his tea, summoning him to come along sharp and not\r\nkeep him waiting there all night. The chaff and the humourous sallies\r\nto which he was subjected, and to which, of course, he had to provide\r\nprompt and effective reply, formed, indeed, his chief danger; for Toad\r\nwas an animal with a strong sense of his own dignity, and the chaff was\r\nmostly (he thought) poor and clumsy, and the humour of the sallies\r\nentirely lacking. However, he kept his temper, though with great\r\ndifficulty, suited his retorts to his company and his supposed\r\ncharacter, and did his best not to overstep the limits of good taste.\r\n\r\nIt seemed hours before he crossed the last courtyard, rejected the\r\npressing invitations from the last guardroom, and dodged the outspread\r\narms of the last warder, pleading with simulated passion for just one\r\nfarewell embrace. But at last he heard the wicket-gate in the great\r\nouter door click behind him, felt the fresh air of the outer world upon\r\nhis anxious brow, and knew that he was free!\r\n\r\nDizzy with the easy success of his daring exploit, he walked quickly\r\ntowards the lights of the town, not knowing in the least what he should\r\ndo next, only quite certain of one thing, that he must remove himself\r\nas quickly as possible from the neighbourhood where the lady he was\r\nforced to represent was so well-known and so popular a character.\r\n\r\nAs he walked along, considering, his attention was caught by some red\r\nand green lights a little way off, to one side of the town, and the\r\nsound of the puffing and snorting of engines and the banging of shunted\r\ntrucks fell on his ear. \xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a piece of luck! A\r\nrailway station is the thing I want most in the whole world at this\r\nmoment; and what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t go through the town to get it, and\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t have to support this humiliating character by repartees which,\r\nthough thoroughly effective, do not assist one\xe2\x80\x99s sense of\r\nself-respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made his way to the station accordingly, consulted a time-table, and\r\nfound that a train, bound more or less in the direction of his home,\r\nwas due to start in half-an-hour. \xe2\x80\x9cMore luck!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, his spirits\r\nrising rapidly, and went off to the booking-office to buy his ticket.\r\n\r\nHe gave the name of the station that he knew to be nearest to the\r\nvillage of which Toad Hall was the principal feature, and mechanically\r\nput his fingers, in search of the necessary money, where his waistcoat\r\npocket should have been. But here the cotton gown, which had nobly\r\nstood by him so far, and which he had basely forgotten, intervened, and\r\nfrustrated his efforts. In a sort of nightmare he struggled with the\r\nstrange uncanny thing that seemed to hold his hands, turn all muscular\r\nstrivings to water, and laugh at him all the time; while other\r\ntravellers, forming up in a line behind, waited with impatience, making\r\nsuggestions of more or less value and comments of more or less\r\nstringency and point. At last\xe2\x80\x94somehow\xe2\x80\x94he never rightly understood\r\nhow\xe2\x80\x94he burst the barriers, attained the goal, arrived at where all\r\nwaistcoat pockets are eternally situated, and found\xe2\x80\x94not only no money,\r\nbut no pocket to hold it, and no waistcoat to hold the pocket!\r\n\r\nTo his horror he recollected that he had left both coat and waistcoat\r\nbehind him in his cell, and with them his pocket-book, money, keys,\r\nwatch, matches, pencil-case\xe2\x80\x94all that makes life worth living, all that\r\ndistinguishes the many-pocketed animal, the lord of creation, from the\r\ninferior one-pocketed or no-pocketed productions that hop or trip about\r\npermissively, unequipped for the real contest.\r\n\r\nIn his misery he made one desperate effort to carry the thing off, and,\r\nwith a return to his fine old manner\xe2\x80\x94a blend of the Squire and the\r\nCollege Don\xe2\x80\x94he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here! I find I\xe2\x80\x99ve left my purse behind. Just\r\ngive me that ticket, will you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send the money on to-morrow?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m well-known in these parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clerk stared at him and the rusty black bonnet a moment, and then\r\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI should think you were pretty well known in these parts,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ve tried this game on often. Here, stand away from the\r\nwindow, please, madam; you\xe2\x80\x99re obstructing the other passengers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn old gentleman who had been prodding him in the back for some moments\r\nhere thrust him away, and, what was worse, addressed him as his good\r\nwoman, which angered Toad more than anything that had occurred that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nBaffled and full of despair, he wandered blindly down the platform\r\nwhere the train was standing, and tears trickled down each side of his\r\nnose. It was hard, he thought, to be within sight of safety and almost\r\nof home, and to be baulked by the want of a few wretched shillings and\r\nby the pettifogging mistrustfulness of paid officials. Very soon his\r\nescape would be discovered, the hunt would be up, he would be caught,\r\nreviled, loaded with chains, dragged back again to prison and\r\nbread-and-water and straw; his guards and penalties would be doubled;\r\nand O, what sarcastic remarks the girl would make! What was to be done?\r\nHe was not swift of foot; his figure was unfortunately recognisable.\r\nCould he not squeeze under the seat of a carriage? He had seen this\r\nmethod adopted by schoolboys, when the journey-money provided by\r\nthoughtful parents had been diverted to other and better ends. As he\r\npondered, he found himself opposite the engine, which was being oiled,\r\nwiped, and generally caressed by its affectionate driver, a burly man\r\nwith an oil-can in one hand and a lump of cotton-waste in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said the engine-driver, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble? You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook particularly cheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, crying afresh, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a poor unhappy washerwoman,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost all my money, and can\xe2\x80\x99t pay for a ticket, and I _must_\r\nget home to-night somehow, and whatever I am to do I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. O\r\ndear, O dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bad business, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engine-driver reflectively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost your money\xe2\x80\x94and can\xe2\x80\x99t get home\xe2\x80\x94and got some kids, too, waiting for\r\nyou, I dare say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny amount of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Toad. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they\xe2\x80\x99ll be hungry\xe2\x80\x94and playing\r\nwith matches\xe2\x80\x94and upsetting lamps, the little innocents!\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nquarrelling, and going on generally. O dear, O dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good engine-driver.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a washerwoman to your trade, says you. Very well, that\xe2\x80\x99s that.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m an engine-driver, as you well may see, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s terribly dirty work. Uses up a power of shirts, it does, till my\r\nmissus is fair tired of washing of \xe2\x80\x99em. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll wash a few shirts for\r\nme when you get home, and send \xe2\x80\x99em along, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a ride on my\r\nengine. It\xe2\x80\x99s against the Company\xe2\x80\x99s regulations, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not so very\r\nparticular in these out-of-the-way parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Toad\xe2\x80\x99s misery turned into rapture as he eagerly scrambled up into\r\nthe cab of the engine. Of course, he had never washed a shirt in his\r\nlife, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t if he tried and, anyhow, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to begin;\r\nbut he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I get safely home to Toad Hall, and have money\r\nagain, and pockets to put it in, I will send the engine-driver enough\r\nto pay for quite a quantity of washing, and that will be the same\r\nthing, or better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guard waved his welcome flag, the engine-driver whistled in\r\ncheerful response, and the train moved out of the station. As the speed\r\nincreased, and the Toad could see on either side of him real fields,\r\nand trees, and hedges, and cows, and horses, all flying past him, and\r\nas he thought how every minute was bringing him nearer to Toad Hall,\r\nand sympathetic friends, and money to chink in his pocket, and a soft\r\nbed to sleep in, and good things to eat, and praise and admiration at\r\nthe recital of his adventures and his surpassing cleverness, he began\r\nto skip up and down and shout and sing snatches of song, to the great\r\nastonishment of the engine-driver, who had come across washerwomen\r\nbefore, at long intervals, but never one at all like this.\r\n\r\nThey had covered many and many a mile, and Toad was already considering\r\nwhat he would have for supper as soon as he got home, when he noticed\r\nthat the engine-driver, with a puzzled expression on his face, was\r\nleaning over the side of the engine and listening hard. Then he saw him\r\nclimb on to the coals and gaze out over the top of the train; then he\r\nreturned and said to Toad: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very strange; we\xe2\x80\x99re the last train\r\nrunning in this direction to-night, yet I could be sworn that I heard\r\nanother following us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad ceased his frivolous antics at once. He became grave and\r\ndepressed, and a dull pain in the lower part of his spine,\r\ncommunicating itself to his legs, made him want to sit down and try\r\ndesperately not to think of all the possibilities.\r\n\r\nBy this time the moon was shining brightly, and the engine-driver,\r\nsteadying himself on the coal, could command a view of the line behind\r\nthem for a long distance.\r\n\r\nPresently he called out, \xe2\x80\x9cI can see it clearly now! It is an engine, on\r\nour rails, coming along at a great pace! It looks as if we were being\r\npursued!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe miserable Toad, crouching in the coal-dust, tried hard to think of\r\nsomething to do, with dismal want of success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are gaining on us fast!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the engine-driver. And the engine\r\nis crowded with the queerest lot of people! Men like ancient warders,\r\nwaving halberds; policemen in their helmets, waving truncheons; and\r\nshabbily dressed men in pot-hats, obvious and unmistakable\r\nplain-clothes detectives even at this distance, waving revolvers and\r\nwalking-sticks; all waving, and all shouting the same thing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Stop,\r\nstop, stop!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Toad fell on his knees among the coals and, raising his clasped\r\npaws in supplication, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cSave me, only save me, dear kind Mr.\r\nEngine-driver, and I will confess everything! I am not the simple\r\nwasherwoman I seem to be! I have no children waiting for me, innocent\r\nor otherwise! I am a toad\xe2\x80\x94the well-known and popular Mr. Toad, a landed\r\nproprietor; I have just escaped, by my great daring and cleverness,\r\nfrom a loathsome dungeon into which my enemies had flung me; and if\r\nthose fellows on that engine recapture me, it will be chains and\r\nbread-and-water and straw and misery once more for poor, unhappy,\r\ninnocent Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe engine-driver looked down upon him very sternly, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\ntell the truth; what were you put in prison for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nothing very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Toad, colouring deeply. \xe2\x80\x9cI only\r\nborrowed a motorcar while the owners were at lunch; they had no need of\r\nit at the time. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to steal it, really; but\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94especially magistrates\xe2\x80\x94take such harsh views of thoughtless and\r\nhigh-spirited actions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe engine-driver looked very grave and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear that you have\r\nbeen indeed a wicked toad, and by rights I ought to give you up to\r\noffended justice. But you are evidently in sore trouble and distress,\r\nso I will not desert you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold with motor-cars, for one thing;\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold with being ordered about by policemen when I\xe2\x80\x99m on my\r\nown engine, for another. And the sight of an animal in tears always\r\nmakes me feel queer and softhearted. So cheer up, Toad! I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my\r\nbest, and we may beat them yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey piled on more coals, shovelling furiously; the furnace roared, the\r\nsparks flew, the engine leapt and swung but still their pursuers slowly\r\ngained. The engine-driver, with a sigh, wiped his brow with a handful\r\nof cotton-waste, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s no good, Toad. You see,\r\nthey are running light, and they have the better engine. There\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\none thing left for us to do, and it\xe2\x80\x99s your only chance, so attend very\r\ncarefully to what I tell you. A short way ahead of us is a long tunnel,\r\nand on the other side of that the line passes through a thick wood.\r\nNow, I will put on all the speed I can while we are running through the\r\ntunnel, but the other fellows will slow down a bit, naturally, for fear\r\nof an accident. When we are through, I will shut off steam and put on\r\nbrakes as hard as I can, and the moment it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to do so you must\r\njump and hide in the wood, before they get through the tunnel and see\r\nyou. Then I will go full speed ahead again, and they can chase me if\r\nthey like, for as long as they like, and as far as they like. Now mind\r\nand be ready to jump when I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey piled on more coals, and the train shot into the tunnel, and the\r\nengine rushed and roared and rattled, till at last they shot out at the\r\nother end into fresh air and the peaceful moonlight, and saw the wood\r\nlying dark and helpful upon either side of the line. The driver shut\r\noff steam and put on brakes, the Toad got down on the step, and as the\r\ntrain slowed down to almost a walking pace he heard the driver call\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, jump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad jumped, rolled down a short embankment, picked himself up unhurt,\r\nscrambled into the wood and hid.\r\n\r\nPeeping out, he saw his train get up speed again and disappear at a\r\ngreat pace. Then out of the tunnel burst the pursuing engine, roaring\r\nand whistling, her motley crew waving their various weapons and\r\nshouting, \xe2\x80\x9cStop! stop! stop!\xe2\x80\x9d When they were past, the Toad had a\r\nhearty laugh\xe2\x80\x94for the first time since he was thrown into prison.\r\n\r\nBut he soon stopped laughing when he came to consider that it was now\r\nvery late and dark and cold, and he was in an unknown wood, with no\r\nmoney and no chance of supper, and still far from friends and home; and\r\nthe dead silence of everything, after the roar and rattle of the train,\r\nwas something of a shock. He dared not leave the shelter of the trees,\r\nso he struck into the wood, with the idea of leaving the railway as far\r\nas possible behind him.\r\n\r\nAfter so many weeks within walls, he found the wood strange and\r\nunfriendly and inclined, he thought, to make fun of him. Night-jars,\r\nsounding their mechanical rattle, made him think that the wood was full\r\nof searching warders, closing in on him. An owl, swooping noiselessly\r\ntowards him, brushed his shoulder with its wing, making him jump with\r\nthe horrid certainty that it was a hand; then flitted off, moth-like,\r\nlaughing its low ho! ho! ho; which Toad thought in very poor taste.\r\nOnce he met a fox, who stopped, looked him up and down in a sarcastic\r\nsort of way, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHullo, washerwoman! Half a pair of socks and a\r\npillow-case short this week! Mind it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t occur again!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nswaggered off, sniggering. Toad looked about for a stone to throw at\r\nhim, but could not succeed in finding one, which vexed him more than\r\nanything. At last, cold, hungry, and tired out, he sought the shelter\r\nof a hollow tree, where with branches and dead leaves he made himself\r\nas comfortable a bed as he could, and slept soundly till the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nWAYFARERS ALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Water Rat was restless, and he did not exactly know why. To all\r\nappearance the summer\xe2\x80\x99s pomp was still at fullest height, and although\r\nin the tilled acres green had given way to gold, though rowans were\r\nreddening, and the woods were dashed here and there with a tawny\r\nfierceness, yet light and warmth and colour were still present in\r\nundiminished measure, clean of any chilly premonitions of the passing\r\nyear. But the constant chorus of the orchards and hedges had shrunk to\r\na casual evensong from a few yet unwearied performers; the robin was\r\nbeginning to assert himself once more; and there was a feeling in the\r\nair of change and departure. The cuckoo, of course, had long been\r\nsilent; but many another feathered friend, for months a part of the\r\nfamiliar landscape and its small society, was missing too and it seemed\r\nthat the ranks thinned steadily day by day. Rat, ever observant of all\r\nwinged movement, saw that it was taking daily a southing tendency; and\r\neven as he lay in bed at night he thought he could make out, passing in\r\nthe darkness overhead, the beat and quiver of impatient pinions,\r\nobedient to the peremptory call.\r\n\r\nNature\xe2\x80\x99s Grand Hotel has its Season, like the others. As the guests one\r\nby one pack, pay, and depart, and the seats at the _table-d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4te_\r\nshrink pitifully at each succeeding meal; as suites of rooms are\r\nclosed, carpets taken up, and waiters sent away; those boarders who are\r\nstaying on, _en pension_, until the next year\xe2\x80\x99s full re-opening, cannot\r\nhelp being somewhat affected by all these flittings and farewells, this\r\neager discussion of plans, routes, and fresh quarters, this daily\r\nshrinkage in the stream of comradeship. One gets unsettled, depressed,\r\nand inclined to be querulous. Why this craving for change? Why not stay\r\non quietly here, like us, and be jolly? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know this hotel out\r\nof the season, and what fun we have among ourselves, we fellows who\r\nremain and see the whole interesting year out. All very true, no doubt\r\nthe others always reply; we quite envy you\xe2\x80\x94and some other year\r\nperhaps\xe2\x80\x94but just now we have engagements\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s the bus at the\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94our time is up! So they depart, with a smile and a nod, and we\r\nmiss them, and feel resentful. The Rat was a self-sufficing sort of\r\nanimal, rooted to the land, and, whoever went, he stayed; still, he\r\ncould not help noticing what was in the air, and feeling some of its\r\ninfluence in his bones.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to settle down to anything seriously, with all this\r\nflitting going on. Leaving the water-side, where rushes stood thick and\r\ntall in a stream that was becoming sluggish and low, he wandered\r\ncountry-wards, crossed a field or two of pasturage already looking\r\ndusty and parched, and thrust into the great sea of wheat, yellow,\r\nwavy, and murmurous, full of quiet motion and small whisperings. Here\r\nhe often loved to wander, through the forest of stiff strong stalks\r\nthat carried their own golden sky away over his head\xe2\x80\x94a sky that was\r\nalways dancing, shimmering, softly talking; or swaying strongly to the\r\npassing wind and recovering itself with a toss and a merry laugh. Here,\r\ntoo, he had many small friends, a society complete in itself, leading\r\nfull and busy lives, but always with a spare moment to gossip, and\r\nexchange news with a visitor. Today, however, though they were civil\r\nenough, the field-mice and harvest-mice seemed preoccupied. Many were\r\ndigging and tunnelling busily; others, gathered together in small\r\ngroups, examined plans and drawings of small flats, stated to be\r\ndesirable and compact, and situated conveniently near the Stores. Some\r\nwere hauling out dusty trunks and dress-baskets, others were already\r\nelbow-deep packing their belongings; while everywhere piles and bundles\r\nof wheat, oats, barley, beech-mast and nuts, lay about ready for\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s old Ratty!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried as soon as they saw him. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and bear\r\na hand, Rat, and don\xe2\x80\x99t stand about idle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of games are you up to?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water Rat severely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow it isn\xe2\x80\x99t time to be thinking of winter quarters yet, by a long\r\nway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, we know that,\xe2\x80\x9d explained a field-mouse rather shamefacedly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s always as well to be in good time, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? We really _must_\r\nget all the furniture and baggage and stores moved out of this before\r\nthose horrid machines begin clicking round the fields; and then, you\r\nknow, the best flats get picked up so quickly nowadays, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlate you have to put up with _anything_; and they want such a lot of\r\ndoing up, too, before they\xe2\x80\x99re fit to move into. Of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re early,\r\nwe know that; but we\xe2\x80\x99re only just making a start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, bother _starts_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid day. Come for a\r\nrow, or a stroll along the hedges, or a picnic in the woods, or\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I _think_ not _to-day_, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the field-mouse\r\nhurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps some _other_ day\xe2\x80\x94when we\xe2\x80\x99ve more _time_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat, with a snort of contempt, swung round to go, tripped over a\r\nhat-box, and fell, with undignified remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf people would be more careful,\xe2\x80\x9d said a field-mouse rather stiffly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand look where they\xe2\x80\x99re going, people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt themselves\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nforget themselves. Mind that hold-all, Rat! You\xe2\x80\x99d better sit down\r\nsomewhere. In an hour or two we may be more free to attend to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x98free\xe2\x80\x99 as you call it much this side of Christmas, I can\r\nsee that,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the Rat grumpily, as he picked his way out of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nHe returned somewhat despondently to his river again\xe2\x80\x94his faithful,\r\nsteady-going old river, which never packed up, flitted, or went into\r\nwinter quarters.\r\n\r\nIn the osiers which fringed the bank he spied a swallow sitting.\r\nPresently it was joined by another, and then by a third; and the birds,\r\nfidgeting restlessly on their bough, talked together earnestly and low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, _already_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, strolling up to them. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nhurry? I call it simply ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, we\xe2\x80\x99re not off yet, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the first\r\nswallow. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re only making plans and arranging things. Talking it\r\nover, you know\xe2\x80\x94what route we\xe2\x80\x99re taking this year, and where we\xe2\x80\x99ll stop,\r\nand so on. That\xe2\x80\x99s half the fun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFun?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat; \xe2\x80\x9cnow that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve _got_ to leave this pleasant place, and your friends who will\r\nmiss you, and your snug homes that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just settled into, why, when\r\nthe hour strikes I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt you\xe2\x80\x99ll go bravely, and face all the\r\ntrouble and discomfort and change and newness, and make believe that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not very unhappy. But to want to talk about it, or even think\r\nabout it, till you really need\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, naturally,\xe2\x80\x9d said the second swallow. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\r\nwe feel it stirring within us, a sweet unrest; then back come the\r\nrecollections one by one, like homing pigeons. They flutter through our\r\ndreams at night, they fly with us in our wheelings and circlings by\r\nday. We hunger to inquire of each other, to compare notes and assure\r\nourselves that it was all really true, as one by one the scents and\r\nsounds and names of long-forgotten places come gradually back and\r\nbeckon to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you stop on for just this year?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the Water Rat,\r\nwistfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll all do our best to make you feel at home. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nidea what good times we have here, while you are far away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried \xe2\x80\x98stopping on\xe2\x80\x99 one year,\xe2\x80\x9d said the third swallow. \xe2\x80\x9cI had grown\r\nso fond of the place that when the time came I hung back and let the\r\nothers go on without me. For a few weeks it was all well enough, but\r\nafterwards, O the weary length of the nights! The shivering, sunless\r\ndays! The air so clammy and chill, and not an insect in an acre of it!\r\nNo, it was no good; my courage broke down, and one cold, stormy night I\r\ntook wing, flying well inland on account of the strong easterly gales.\r\nIt was snowing hard as I beat through the passes of the great\r\nmountains, and I had a stiff fight to win through; but never shall I\r\nforget the blissful feeling of the hot sun again on my back as I sped\r\ndown to the lakes that lay so blue and placid below me, and the taste\r\nof my first fat insect! The past was like a bad dream; the future was\r\nall happy holiday as I moved southwards week by week, easily, lazily,\r\nlingering as long as I dared, but always heeding the call! No, I had\r\nhad my warning; never again did I think of disobedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, the call of the South, of the South!\xe2\x80\x9d twittered the other two\r\ndreamily. \xe2\x80\x9cIts songs its hues, its radiant air! O, do you remember\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand, forgetting the Rat, they slid into passionate reminiscence, while\r\nhe listened fascinated, and his heart burned within him. In himself,\r\ntoo, he knew that it was vibrating at last, that chord hitherto dormant\r\nand unsuspected. The mere chatter of these southern-bound birds, their\r\npale and second-hand reports, had yet power to awaken this wild new\r\nsensation and thrill him through and through with it; what would one\r\nmoment of the real thing work in him\xe2\x80\x94one passionate touch of the real\r\nsouthern sun, one waft of the authentic odor? With closed eyes he dared\r\nto dream a moment in full abandonment, and when he looked again the\r\nriver seemed steely and chill, the green fields grey and lightless.\r\nThen his loyal heart seemed to cry out on his weaker self for its\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ever come back, then, at all?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded of the swallows\r\njealously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you find to attract you in this poor drab little\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first swallow, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the other call is not\r\nfor us too, in its due season? The call of lush meadow-grass, wet\r\norchards, warm, insect-haunted ponds, of browsing cattle, of haymaking,\r\nand all the farm-buildings clustering round the House of the perfect\r\nEaves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the second one, that you are the only living\r\nthing that craves with a hungry longing to hear the cuckoo\xe2\x80\x99s note\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn due time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the third, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall be home-sick once more for\r\nquiet water-lilies swaying on the surface of an English stream. But\r\nto-day all that seems pale and thin and very far away. Just now our\r\nblood dances to other music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey fell a-twittering among themselves once more, and this time their\r\nintoxicating babble was of violet seas, tawny sands, and lizard-haunted\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nRestlessly the Rat wandered off once more, climbed the slope that rose\r\ngently from the north bank of the river, and lay looking out towards\r\nthe great ring of Downs that barred his vision further southwards\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nsimple horizon hitherto, his Mountains of the Moon, his limit behind\r\nwhich lay nothing he had cared to see or to know. To-day, to him gazing\r\nSouth with a new-born need stirring in his heart, the clear sky over\r\ntheir long low outline seemed to pulsate with promise; to-day, the\r\nunseen was everything, the unknown the only real fact of life. On this\r\nside of the hills was now the real blank, on the other lay the crowded\r\nand coloured panorama that his inner eye was seeing so clearly. What\r\nseas lay beyond, green, leaping, and crested! What sun-bathed coasts,\r\nalong which the white villas glittered against the olive woods! What\r\nquiet harbours, thronged with gallant shipping bound for purple islands\r\nof wine and spice, islands set low in languorous waters!\r\n\r\nHe rose and descended river-wards once more; then changed his mind and\r\nsought the side of the dusty lane. There, lying half-buried in the\r\nthick, cool under-hedge tangle that bordered it, he could muse on the\r\nmetalled road and all the wondrous world that it led to; on all the\r\nwayfarers, too, that might have trodden it, and the fortunes and\r\nadventures they had gone to seek or found unseeking\xe2\x80\x94out there,\r\nbeyond\xe2\x80\x94beyond!\r\n\r\nFootsteps fell on his ear, and the figure of one that walked somewhat\r\nwearily came into view; and he saw that it was a Rat, and a very dusty\r\none. The wayfarer, as he reached him, saluted with a gesture of\r\ncourtesy that had something foreign about it\xe2\x80\x94hesitated a moment\xe2\x80\x94then\r\nwith a pleasant smile turned from the track and sat down by his side in\r\nthe cool herbage. He seemed tired, and the Rat let him rest\r\nunquestioned, understanding something of what was in his thoughts;\r\nknowing, too, the value all animals attach at times to mere silent\r\ncompanionship, when the weary muscles slacken and the mind marks time.\r\n\r\nThe wayfarer was lean and keen-featured, and somewhat bowed at the\r\nshoulders; his paws were thin and long, his eyes much wrinkled at the\r\ncorners, and he wore small gold ear rings in his neatly-set well-shaped\r\nears. His knitted jersey was of a faded blue, his breeches, patched and\r\nstained, were based on a blue foundation, and his small belongings that\r\nhe carried were tied up in a blue cotton handkerchief.\r\n\r\nWhen he had rested awhile the stranger sighed, snuffed the air, and\r\nlooked about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was clover, that warm whiff on the breeze,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthose are cows we hear cropping the grass behind us and blowing softly\r\nbetween mouthfuls. There is a sound of distant reapers, and yonder\r\nrises a blue line of cottage smoke against the woodland. The river runs\r\nsomewhere close by, for I hear the call of a moorhen, and I see by your\r\nbuild that you\xe2\x80\x99re a freshwater mariner. Everything seems asleep, and\r\nyet going on all the time. It is a goodly life that you lead, friend;\r\nno doubt the best in the world, if only you are strong enough to lead\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s _the_ life, the only life, to live,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the Water Rat\r\ndreamily, and without his usual whole-hearted conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not say exactly that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger cautiously; \xe2\x80\x9cbut no\r\ndoubt it\xe2\x80\x99s the best. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried it, and I know. And because I\xe2\x80\x99ve just\r\ntried it\xe2\x80\x94six months of it\xe2\x80\x94and know it\xe2\x80\x99s the best, here am I, footsore\r\nand hungry, tramping away from it, tramping southward, following the\r\nold call, back to the old life, _the_ life which is mine and which will\r\nnot let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this, then, yet another of them?\xe2\x80\x9d mused the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where have\r\nyou just come from?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. He hardly dared to ask where he was\r\nbound for; he seemed to know the answer only too well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice little farm,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the wayfarer, briefly. \xe2\x80\x9cUpalong in that\r\ndirection\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he nodded northwards. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about it. I had everything\r\nI could want\xe2\x80\x94everything I had any right to expect of life, and more;\r\nand here I am! Glad to be here all the same, though, glad to be here!\r\nSo many miles further on the road, so many hours nearer to my heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis shining eyes held fast to the horizon, and he seemed to be\r\nlistening for some sound that was wanting from that inland acreage,\r\nvocal as it was with the cheerful music of pasturage and farmyard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not one of _us_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water Rat, \xe2\x80\x9cnor yet a farmer; nor\r\neven, I should judge, of this country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a seafaring rat, I am, and the port\r\nI originally hail from is Constantinople, though I\xe2\x80\x99m a sort of a\r\nforeigner there too, in a manner of speaking. You will have heard of\r\nConstantinople, friend? A fair city, and an ancient and glorious one.\r\nAnd you may have heard, too, of Sigurd, King of Norway, and how he\r\nsailed thither with sixty ships, and how he and his men rode up through\r\nstreets all canopied in their honour with purple and gold; and how the\r\nEmperor and Empress came down and banqueted with him on board his ship.\r\nWhen Sigurd returned home, many of his Northmen remained behind and\r\nentered the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s body-guard, and my ancestor, a Norwegian born,\r\nstayed behind too, with the ships that Sigurd gave the Emperor.\r\nSeafarers we have ever been, and no wonder; as for me, the city of my\r\nbirth is no more my home than any pleasant port between there and the\r\nLondon River. I know them all, and they know me. Set me down on any of\r\ntheir quays or foreshores, and I am home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you go great voyages,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water Rat with growing\r\ninterest. \xe2\x80\x9cMonths and months out of sight of land, and provisions\r\nrunning short, and allowanced as to water, and your mind communing with\r\nthe mighty ocean, and all that sort of thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sea Rat frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a life as you describe\r\nwould not suit me at all. I\xe2\x80\x99m in the coasting trade, and rarely out of\r\nsight of land. It\xe2\x80\x99s the jolly times on shore that appeal to me, as much\r\nas any seafaring. O, those southern seaports! The smell of them, the\r\nriding-lights at night, the glamour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps you have chosen the better way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water Rat, but\r\nrather doubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me something of your coasting, then, if you\r\nhave a mind to, and what sort of harvest an animal of spirit might hope\r\nto bring home from it to warm his latter days with gallant memories by\r\nthe fireside; for my life, I confess to you, feels to me to-day\r\nsomewhat narrow and circumscribed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy last voyage,\xe2\x80\x9d began the Sea Rat, \xe2\x80\x9cthat landed me eventually in this\r\ncountry, bound with high hopes for my inland farm, will serve as a good\r\nexample of any of them, and, indeed, as an epitome of my\r\nhighly-coloured life. Family troubles, as usual, began it. The domestic\r\nstorm-cone was hoisted, and I shipped myself on board a small trading\r\nvessel bound from Constantinople, by classic seas whose every wave\r\nthrobs with a deathless memory, to the Grecian Islands and the Levant.\r\nThose were golden days and balmy nights! In and out of harbour all the\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94old friends everywhere\xe2\x80\x94sleeping in some cool temple or ruined\r\ncistern during the heat of the day\xe2\x80\x94feasting and song after sundown,\r\nunder great stars set in a velvet sky! Thence we turned and coasted up\r\nthe Adriatic, its shores swimming in an atmosphere of amber, rose, and\r\naquamarine; we lay in wide land-locked harbours, we roamed through\r\nancient and noble cities, until at last one morning, as the sun rose\r\nroyally behind us, we rode into Venice down a path of gold. O, Venice\r\nis a fine city, wherein a rat can wander at his ease and take his\r\npleasure! Or, when weary of wandering, can sit at the edge of the Grand\r\nCanal at night, feasting with his friends, when the air is full of\r\nmusic and the sky full of stars, and the lights flash and shimmer on\r\nthe polished steel prows of the swaying gondolas, packed so that you\r\ncould walk across the canal on them from side to side! And then the\r\nfood\xe2\x80\x94do you like shellfish? Well, well, we won\xe2\x80\x99t linger over that now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a time; and the Water Rat, silent too and enthralled,\r\nfloated on dream-canals and heard a phantom song pealing high between\r\nvaporous grey wave-lapped walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouthwards we sailed again at last,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Sea Rat, \xe2\x80\x9ccoasting\r\ndown the Italian shore, till finally we made Palermo, and there I\r\nquitted for a long, happy spell on shore. I never stick too long to one\r\nship; one gets narrow-minded and prejudiced. Besides, Sicily is one of\r\nmy happy hunting-grounds. I know everybody there, and their ways just\r\nsuit me. I spent many jolly weeks in the island, staying with friends\r\nup country. When I grew restless again I took advantage of a ship that\r\nwas trading to Sardinia and Corsica; and very glad I was to feel the\r\nfresh breeze and the sea-spray in my face once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it very hot and stuffy, down in the\xe2\x80\x94hold, I think you call\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Water Rat.\r\n\r\nThe seafarer looked at him with the suspicion of a wink. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an old\r\nhand,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked with much simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s cabin\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nenough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a hard life, by all accounts,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Rat, sunk in deep\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the crew it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the seafarer gravely, again with the\r\nghost of a wink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Corsica,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI made use of a ship that was taking wine\r\nto the mainland. We made Alassio in the evening, lay to, hauled up our\r\nwine-casks, and hove them overboard, tied one to the other by a long\r\nline. Then the crew took to the boats and rowed shorewards, singing as\r\nthey went, and drawing after them the long bobbing procession of casks,\r\nlike a mile of porpoises. On the sands they had horses waiting, which\r\ndragged the casks up the steep street of the little town with a fine\r\nrush and clatter and scramble. When the last cask was in, we went and\r\nrefreshed and rested, and sat late into the night, drinking with our\r\nfriends, and next morning I took to the great olive-woods for a spell\r\nand a rest. For now I had done with islands for the time, and ports and\r\nshipping were plentiful; so I led a lazy life among the peasants, lying\r\nand watching them work, or stretched high on the hillside with the blue\r\nMediterranean far below me. And so at length, by easy stages, and\r\npartly on foot, partly by sea, to Marseilles, and the meeting of old\r\nshipmates, and the visiting of great ocean-bound vessels, and feasting\r\nonce more. Talk of shell-fish! Why, sometimes I dream of the shell-fish\r\nof Marseilles, and wake up crying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat reminds me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the polite Water Rat; \xe2\x80\x9cyou happened to mention\r\nthat you were hungry, and I ought to have spoken earlier. Of course,\r\nyou will stop and take your midday meal with me? My hole is close by;\r\nit is some time past noon, and you are very welcome to whatever there\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I call that kind and brotherly of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sea Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nindeed hungry when I sat down, and ever since I inadvertently happened\r\nto mention shell-fish, my pangs have been extreme. But couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nfetch it along out here? I am none too fond of going under hatches,\r\nunless I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to; and then, while we eat, I could tell you more\r\nconcerning my voyages and the pleasant life I lead\xe2\x80\x94at least, it is very\r\npleasant to me, and by your attention I judge it commends itself to\r\nyou; whereas if we go indoors it is a hundred to one that I shall\r\npresently fall asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is indeed an excellent suggestion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water Rat, and\r\nhurried off home. There he got out the luncheon-basket and packed a\r\nsimple meal, in which, remembering the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s origin and\r\npreferences, he took care to include a yard of long French bread, a\r\nsausage out of which the garlic sang, some cheese which lay down and\r\ncried, and a long-necked straw-covered flask wherein lay bottled\r\nsunshine shed and garnered on far Southern slopes. Thus laden, he\r\nreturned with all speed, and blushed for pleasure at the old seaman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommendations of his taste and judgment, as together they unpacked the\r\nbasket and laid out the contents on the grass by the roadside.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Rat, as soon as his hunger was somewhat assuaged, continued the\r\nhistory of his latest voyage, conducting his simple hearer from port to\r\nport of Spain, landing him at Lisbon, Oporto, and Bordeaux, introducing\r\nhim to the pleasant harbours of Cornwall and Devon, and so up the\r\nChannel to that final quayside, where, landing after winds long\r\ncontrary, storm-driven and weather-beaten, he had caught the first\r\nmagical hints and heraldings of another Spring, and, fired by these,\r\nhad sped on a long tramp inland, hungry for the experiment of life on\r\nsome quiet farmstead, very far from the weary beating of any sea.\r\n\r\nSpell-bound and quivering with excitement, the Water Rat followed the\r\nAdventurer league by league, over stormy bays, through crowded\r\nroadsteads, across harbour bars on a racing tide, up winding rivers\r\nthat hid their busy little towns round a sudden turn; and left him with\r\na regretful sigh planted at his dull inland farm, about which he\r\ndesired to hear nothing.\r\n\r\nBy this time their meal was over, and the Seafarer, refreshed and\r\nstrengthened, his voice more vibrant, his eye lit with a brightness\r\nthat seemed caught from some far-away sea-beacon, filled his glass with\r\nthe red and glowing vintage of the South, and, leaning towards the\r\nWater Rat, compelled his gaze and held him, body and soul, while he\r\ntalked. Those eyes were of the changing foam-streaked grey-green of\r\nleaping Northern seas; in the glass shone a hot ruby that seemed the\r\nvery heart of the South, beating for him who had courage to respond to\r\nits pulsation. The twin lights, the shifting grey and the steadfast\r\nred, mastered the Water Rat and held him bound, fascinated, powerless.\r\nThe quiet world outside their rays receded far away and ceased to be.\r\nAnd the talk, the wonderful talk flowed on\xe2\x80\x94or was it speech entirely,\r\nor did it pass at times into song\xe2\x80\x94chanty of the sailors weighing the\r\ndripping anchor, sonorous hum of the shrouds in a tearing North-Easter,\r\nballad of the fisherman hauling his nets at sundown against an apricot\r\nsky, chords of guitar and mandoline from gondola or caique? Did it\r\nchange into the cry of the wind, plaintive at first, angrily shrill as\r\nit freshened, rising to a tearing whistle, sinking to a musical trickle\r\nof air from the leech of the bellying sail? All these sounds the\r\nspell-bound listener seemed to hear, and with them the hungry complaint\r\nof the gulls and the sea-mews, the soft thunder of the breaking wave,\r\nthe cry of the protesting shingle. Back into speech again it passed,\r\nand with beating heart he was following the adventures of a dozen\r\nseaports, the fights, the escapes, the rallies, the comradeships, the\r\ngallant undertakings; or he searched islands for treasure, fished in\r\nstill lagoons and dozed day-long on warm white sand. Of deep-sea\r\nfishings he heard tell, and mighty silver gatherings of the mile-long\r\nnet; of sudden perils, noise of breakers on a moonless night, or the\r\ntall bows of the great liner taking shape overhead through the fog; of\r\nthe merry home-coming, the headland rounded, the harbour lights opened\r\nout; the groups seen dimly on the quay, the cheery hail, the splash of\r\nthe hawser; the trudge up the steep little street towards the\r\ncomforting glow of red-curtained windows.\r\n\r\nLastly, in his waking dream it seemed to him that the Adventurer had\r\nrisen to his feet, but was still speaking, still holding him fast with\r\nhis sea-grey eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d he was softly saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI take to the road again, holding on\r\nsouthwestwards for many a long and dusty day; till at last I reach the\r\nlittle grey sea town I know so well, that clings along one steep side\r\nof the harbour. There through dark doorways you look down flights of\r\nstone steps, overhung by great pink tufts of valerian and ending in a\r\npatch of sparkling blue water. The little boats that lie tethered to\r\nthe rings and stanchions of the old sea-wall are gaily painted as those\r\nI clambered in and out of in my own childhood; the salmon leap on the\r\nflood tide, schools of mackerel flash and play past quay-sides and\r\nforeshores, and by the windows the great vessels glide, night and day,\r\nup to their moorings or forth to the open sea. There, sooner or later,\r\nthe ships of all seafaring nations arrive; and there, at its destined\r\nhour, the ship of my choice will let go its anchor. I shall take my\r\ntime, I shall tarry and bide, till at last the right one lies waiting\r\nfor me, warped out into midstream, loaded low, her bowsprit pointing\r\ndown harbour. I shall slip on board, by boat or along hawser; and then\r\none morning I shall wake to the song and tramp of the sailors, the\r\nclink of the capstan, and the rattle of the anchor-chain coming merrily\r\nin. We shall break out the jib and the foresail, the white houses on\r\nthe harbour side will glide slowly past us as she gathers steering-way,\r\nand the voyage will have begun! As she forges towards the headland she\r\nwill clothe herself with canvas; and then, once outside, the sounding\r\nslap of great green seas as she heels to the wind, pointing South!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, you will come too, young brother; for the days pass, and\r\nnever return, and the South still waits for you. Take the Adventure,\r\nheed the call, now ere the irrevocable moment passes! \xe2\x80\x99Tis but a\r\nbanging of the door behind you, a blithesome step forward, and you are\r\nout of the old life and into the new! Then some day, some day long\r\nhence, jog home here if you will, when the cup has been drained and the\r\nplay has been played, and sit down by your quiet river with a store of\r\ngoodly memories for company. You can easily overtake me on the road,\r\nfor you are young, and I am ageing and go softly. I will linger, and\r\nlook back; and at last I will surely see you coming, eager and\r\nlight-hearted, with all the South in your face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice died away and ceased as an insect\xe2\x80\x99s tiny trumpet dwindles\r\nswiftly into silence; and the Water Rat, paralysed and staring, saw at\r\nlast but a distant speck on the white surface of the road.\r\n\r\nMechanically he rose and proceeded to repack the luncheon-basket,\r\ncarefully and without haste. Mechanically he returned home, gathered\r\ntogether a few small necessaries and special treasures he was fond of,\r\nand put them in a satchel; acting with slow deliberation, moving about\r\nthe room like a sleep-walker; listening ever with parted lips. He swung\r\nthe satchel over his shoulder, carefully selected a stout stick for his\r\nwayfaring, and with no haste, but with no hesitation at all, he stepped\r\nacross the threshold just as the Mole appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where are you off to, Ratty?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Mole in great surprise,\r\ngrasping him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing South, with the rest of them,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Rat in a dreamy\r\nmonotone, never looking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cSeawards first and then on shipboard,\r\nand so to the shores that are calling me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed resolutely forward, still without haste, but with dogged\r\nfixity of purpose; but the Mole, now thoroughly alarmed, placed himself\r\nin front of him, and looking into his eyes saw that they were glazed\r\nand set and turned a streaked and shifting grey\xe2\x80\x94not his friend\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nbut the eyes of some other animal! Grappling with him strongly he\r\ndragged him inside, threw him down, and held him.\r\n\r\nThe Rat struggled desperately for a few moments, and then his strength\r\nseemed suddenly to leave him, and he lay still and exhausted, with\r\nclosed eyes, trembling. Presently the Mole assisted him to rise and\r\nplaced him in a chair, where he sat collapsed and shrunken into\r\nhimself, his body shaken by a violent shivering, passing in time into\r\nan hysterical fit of dry sobbing. Mole made the door fast, threw the\r\nsatchel into a drawer and locked it, and sat down quietly on the table\r\nby his friend, waiting for the strange seizure to pass. Gradually the\r\nRat sank into a troubled doze, broken by starts and confused murmurings\r\nof things strange and wild and foreign to the unenlightened Mole; and\r\nfrom that he passed into a deep slumber.\r\n\r\nVery anxious in mind, the Mole left him for a time and busied himself\r\nwith household matters; and it was getting dark when he returned to the\r\nparlour and found the Rat where he had left him, wide awake indeed, but\r\nlistless, silent, and dejected. He took one hasty glance at his eyes;\r\nfound them, to his great gratification, clear and dark and brown again\r\nas before; and then sat down and tried to cheer him up and help him to\r\nrelate what had happened to him.\r\n\r\nPoor Ratty did his best, by degrees, to explain things; but how could\r\nhe put into cold words what had mostly been suggestion? How recall, for\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, the haunting sea voices that had sung to him, how\r\nreproduce at second-hand the magic of the Seafarer\xe2\x80\x99s hundred\r\nreminiscences? Even to himself, now the spell was broken and the\r\nglamour gone, he found it difficult to account for what had seemed,\r\nsome hours ago, the inevitable and only thing. It is not surprising,\r\nthen, that he failed to convey to the Mole any clear idea of what he\r\nhad been through that day.\r\n\r\nTo the Mole this much was plain: the fit, or attack, had passed away,\r\nand had left him sane again, though shaken and cast down by the\r\nreaction. But he seemed to have lost all interest for the time in the\r\nthings that went to make up his daily life, as well as in all pleasant\r\nforecastings of the altered days and doings that the changing season\r\nwas surely bringing.\r\n\r\nCasually, then, and with seeming indifference, the Mole turned his talk\r\nto the harvest that was being gathered in, the towering wagons and\r\ntheir straining teams, the growing ricks, and the large moon rising\r\nover bare acres dotted with sheaves. He talked of the reddening apples\r\naround, of the browning nuts, of jams and preserves and the distilling\r\nof cordials; till by easy stages such as these he reached midwinter,\r\nits hearty joys and its snug home life, and then he became simply\r\nlyrical.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the Rat began to sit up and to join in. His dull eye\r\nbrightened, and he lost some of his listening air.\r\n\r\nPresently the tactful Mole slipped away and returned with a pencil and\r\na few half-sheets of paper, which he placed on the table at his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite a long time since you did any poetry,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmight have a try at it this evening, instead of\xe2\x80\x94well, brooding over\r\nthings so much. I\xe2\x80\x99ve an idea that you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel a lot better when you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot something jotted down\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s only just the rhymes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat pushed the paper away from him wearily, but the discreet Mole\r\ntook occasion to leave the room, and when he peeped in again some time\r\nlater, the Rat was absorbed and deaf to the world; alternately\r\nscribbling and sucking the top of his pencil. It is true that he sucked\r\na good deal more than he scribbled; but it was joy to the Mole to know\r\nthat the cure had at least begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\nTHE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe front door of the hollow tree faced eastwards, so Toad was called\r\nat an early hour; partly by the bright sunlight streaming in on him,\r\npartly by the exceeding coldness of his toes, which made him dream that\r\nhe was at home in bed in his own handsome room with the Tudor window,\r\non a cold winter\xe2\x80\x99s night, and his bedclothes had got up, grumbling and\r\nprotesting they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand the cold any longer, and had run\r\ndownstairs to the kitchen fire to warm themselves; and he had followed,\r\non bare feet, along miles and miles of icy stone-paved passages,\r\narguing and beseeching them to be reasonable. He would probably have\r\nbeen aroused much earlier, had he not slept for some weeks on straw\r\nover stone flags, and almost forgotten the friendly feeling of thick\r\nblankets pulled well up round the chin.\r\n\r\nSitting up, he rubbed his eyes first and his complaining toes next,\r\nwondered for a moment where he was, looking round for familiar stone\r\nwall and little barred window; then, with a leap of the heart,\r\nremembered everything\xe2\x80\x94his escape, his flight, his pursuit; remembered,\r\nfirst and best thing of all, that he was free!\r\n\r\nFree! The word and the thought alone were worth fifty blankets. He was\r\nwarm from end to end as he thought of the jolly world outside, waiting\r\neagerly for him to make his triumphal entrance, ready to serve him and\r\nplay up to him, anxious to help him and to keep him company, as it\r\nalways had been in days of old before misfortune fell upon him. He\r\nshook himself and combed the dry leaves out of his hair with his\r\nfingers; and, his toilet complete, marched forth into the comfortable\r\nmorning sun, cold but confident, hungry but hopeful, all nervous\r\nterrors of yesterday dispelled by rest and sleep and frank and\r\nheartening sunshine.\r\n\r\nHe had the world all to himself, that early summer morning. The dewy\r\nwoodland, as he threaded it, was solitary and still: the green fields\r\nthat succeeded the trees were his own to do as he liked with; the road\r\nitself, when he reached it, in that loneliness that was everywhere,\r\nseemed, like a stray dog, to be looking anxiously for company. Toad,\r\nhowever, was looking for something that could talk, and tell him\r\nclearly which way he ought to go. It is all very well, when you have a\r\nlight heart, and a clear conscience, and money in your pocket, and\r\nnobody scouring the country for you to drag you off to prison again, to\r\nfollow where the road beckons and points, not caring whither. The\r\npractical Toad cared very much indeed, and he could have kicked the\r\nroad for its helpless silence when every minute was of importance to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe reserved rustic road was presently joined by a shy little brother\r\nin the shape of a canal, which took its hand and ambled along by its\r\nside in perfect confidence, but with the same tongue-tied,\r\nuncommunicative attitude towards strangers. \xe2\x80\x9cBother them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, anyhow, one thing\xe2\x80\x99s clear. They must both be coming\r\n_from_ somewhere, and going _to_ somewhere. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get over that.\r\nToad, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d So he marched on patiently by the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\r\n\r\nRound a bend in the canal came plodding a solitary horse, stooping\r\nforward as if in anxious thought. From rope traces attached to his\r\ncollar stretched a long line, taut, but dipping with his stride, the\r\nfurther part of it dripping pearly drops. Toad let the horse pass, and\r\nstood waiting for what the fates were sending him.\r\n\r\nWith a pleasant swirl of quiet water at its blunt bow the barge slid up\r\nalongside of him, its gaily painted gunwale level with the towing-path,\r\nits sole occupant a big stout woman wearing a linen sun-bonnet, one\r\nbrawny arm laid along the tiller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice morning, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked to Toad, as she drew up level\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say it is, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d responded Toad politely, as he walked along\r\nthe tow-path abreast of her. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare it _is_ a nice morning to them\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not in sore trouble, like what I am. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my married daughter,\r\nshe sends off to me post-haste to come to her at once; so off I comes,\r\nnot knowing what may be happening or going to happen, but fearing the\r\nworst, as you will understand, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a mother, too. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nleft my business to look after itself\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m in the washing and laundering\r\nline, you must know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ve left my young children to look\r\nafter themselves, and a more mischievous and troublesome set of young\r\nimps doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost all my money, and lost my way,\r\nand as for what may be happening to my married daughter, why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to think of it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere might your married daughter be living, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nbarge-woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lives near to the river, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Toad. \xe2\x80\x9cClose to a fine\r\nhouse called Toad Hall, that\xe2\x80\x99s somewheres hereabouts in these parts.\r\nPerhaps you may have heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad Hall? Why, I\xe2\x80\x99m going that way myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the barge-woman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis canal joins the river some miles further on, a little above Toad\r\nHall; and then it\xe2\x80\x99s an easy walk. You come along in the barge with me,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a lift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe steered the barge close to the bank, and Toad, with many humble and\r\ngrateful acknowledgments, stepped lightly on board and sat down with\r\ngreat satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cToad\xe2\x80\x99s luck again!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cI always come out\r\non top!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re in the washing business, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d said the barge-woman\r\npolitely, as they glided along. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd a very good business you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\ntoo, I dare say, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not making too free in saying so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinest business in the whole country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad airily. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the\r\ngentry come to me\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to any one else if they were paid, they\r\nknow me so well. You see, I understand my work thoroughly, and attend\r\nto it all myself. Washing, ironing, clear-starching, making up gents\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfine shirts for evening wear\xe2\x80\x94everything\xe2\x80\x99s done under my own eye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t _do_ all that work yourself, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nbarge-woman respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I have girls,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad lightly: \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty girls or thereabouts,\r\nalways at work. But you know what _girls_ are, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Nasty little\r\nhussies, that\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ call \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barge-woman with great heartiness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I dare\r\nsay you set yours to rights, the idle trollops! And are you _very_ fond\r\nof washing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad. \xe2\x80\x9cI simply dote on it. Never so happy as when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got both arms in the wash-tub. But, then, it comes so easy to me!\r\nNo trouble at all! A real pleasure, I assure you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a bit of luck, meeting you!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the barge-woman,\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cA regular piece of good fortune for both of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Toad, nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, look at me, now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the barge-woman. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ like washing,\r\ntoo, just the same as you do; and for that matter, whether I like it or\r\nnot I have got to do all my own, naturally, moving about as I do. Now\r\nmy husband, he\xe2\x80\x99s such a fellow for shirking his work and leaving the\r\nbarge to me, that never a moment do I get for seeing to my own affairs.\r\nBy rights he ought to be here now, either steering or attending to the\r\nhorse, though luckily the horse has sense enough to attend to himself.\r\nInstead of which, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone off with the dog, to see if they can\xe2\x80\x99t pick\r\nup a rabbit for dinner somewhere. Says he\xe2\x80\x99ll catch me up at the next\r\nlock. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s as may be\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust him, once he gets off with\r\nthat dog, who\xe2\x80\x99s worse than he is. But meantime, how am I to get on with\r\nmy washing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, never mind about the washing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, not liking the subject.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and fix your mind on that rabbit. A nice fat young rabbit, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbound. Got any onions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t fix my mind on anything but my washing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barge-woman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I wonder you can be talking of rabbits, with such a joyful\r\nprospect before you. There\xe2\x80\x99s a heap of things of mine that you\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nin a corner of the cabin. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll just take one or two of the most\r\nnecessary sort\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t venture to describe them to a lady like you, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll recognise them at a glance\xe2\x80\x94and put them through the wash-tub as\r\nwe go along, why, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a pleasure to you, as you rightly say, and a\r\nreal help to me. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find a tub handy, and soap, and a kettle on the\r\nstove, and a bucket to haul up water from the canal with. Then I shall\r\nknow you\xe2\x80\x99re enjoying yourself, instead of sitting here idle, looking at\r\nthe scenery and yawning your head off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you let me steer!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, now thoroughly frightened, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthen you can get on with your washing your own way. I might spoil your\r\nthings, or not do \xe2\x80\x99em as you like. I\xe2\x80\x99m more used to gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s things\r\nmyself. It\xe2\x80\x99s my special line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet you steer?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the barge-woman, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes some\r\npractice to steer a barge properly. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s dull work, and I want\r\nyou to be happy. No, you shall do the washing you are so fond of, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to the steering that I understand. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try and deprive me\r\nof the pleasure of giving you a treat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad was fairly cornered. He looked for escape this way and that, saw\r\nthat he was too far from the bank for a flying leap, and sullenly\r\nresigned himself to his fate. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it comes to that,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought in\r\ndesperation, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose any fool can _wash!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fetched tub, soap, and other necessaries from the cabin, selected a\r\nfew garments at random, tried to recollect what he had seen in casual\r\nglances through laundry windows, and set to.\r\n\r\nA long half-hour passed, and every minute of it saw Toad getting\r\ncrosser and crosser. Nothing that he could do to the things seemed to\r\nplease them or do them good. He tried coaxing, he tried slapping, he\r\ntried punching; they smiled back at him out of the tub unconverted,\r\nhappy in their original sin. Once or twice he looked nervously over his\r\nshoulder at the barge-woman, but she appeared to be gazing out in front\r\nof her, absorbed in her steering. His back ached badly, and he noticed\r\nwith dismay that his paws were beginning to get all crinkly. Now Toad\r\nwas very proud of his paws. He muttered under his breath words that\r\nshould never pass the lips of either washerwomen or Toads; and lost the\r\nsoap, for the fiftieth time.\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter made him straighten himself and look round. The\r\nbarge-woman was leaning back and laughing unrestrainedly, till the\r\ntears ran down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching you all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you must\r\nbe a humbug all along, from the conceited way you talked. Pretty\r\nwasherwoman you are! Never washed so much as a dish-clout in your life,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll lay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad\xe2\x80\x99s temper which had been simmering viciously for some time, now\r\nfairly boiled over, and he lost all control of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou common, low, _fat_ barge-woman!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you dare to\r\ntalk to your betters like that! Washerwoman indeed! I would have you to\r\nknow that I am a Toad, a very well-known, respected, distinguished\r\nToad! I may be under a bit of a cloud at present, but I will _not_ be\r\nlaughed at by a bargewoman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman moved nearer to him and peered under his bonnet keenly and\r\nclosely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, so you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never! A horrid, nasty,\r\ncrawly Toad! And in my nice clean barge, too! Now that is a thing that\r\nI will _not_ have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe relinquished the tiller for a moment. One big mottled arm shot out\r\nand caught Toad by a fore-leg, while the other-gripped him fast by a\r\nhind-leg. Then the world turned suddenly upside down, the barge seemed\r\nto flit lightly across the sky, the wind whistled in his ears, and Toad\r\nfound himself flying through the air, revolving rapidly as he went.\r\n\r\nThe water, when he eventually reached it with a loud splash, proved\r\nquite cold enough for his taste, though its chill was not sufficient to\r\nquell his proud spirit, or slake the heat of his furious temper. He\r\nrose to the surface spluttering, and when he had wiped the duck-weed\r\nout of his eyes the first thing he saw was the fat barge-woman looking\r\nback at him over the stern of the retreating barge and laughing; and he\r\nvowed, as he coughed and choked, to be even with her.\r\n\r\nHe struck out for the shore, but the cotton gown greatly impeded his\r\nefforts, and when at length he touched land he found it hard to climb\r\nup the steep bank unassisted. He had to take a minute or two\xe2\x80\x99s rest to\r\nrecover his breath; then, gathering his wet skirts well over his arms,\r\nhe started to run after the barge as fast as his legs would carry him,\r\nwild with indignation, thirsting for revenge.\r\n\r\nThe barge-woman was still laughing when he drew up level with her. \xe2\x80\x9cPut\r\nyourself through your mangle, washerwoman,\xe2\x80\x9d she called out, \xe2\x80\x9cand iron\r\nyour face and crimp it, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll pass for quite a decent-looking\r\nToad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad never paused to reply. Solid revenge was what he wanted, not\r\ncheap, windy, verbal triumphs, though he had a thing or two in his mind\r\nthat he would have liked to say. He saw what he wanted ahead of him.\r\nRunning swiftly on he overtook the horse, unfastened the towrope and\r\ncast off, jumped lightly on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s back, and urged it to a gallop\r\nby kicking it vigorously in the sides. He steered for the open country,\r\nabandoning the tow-path, and swinging his steed down a rutty lane. Once\r\nhe looked back, and saw that the barge had run aground on the other\r\nside of the canal, and the barge-woman was gesticulating wildly and\r\nshouting, \xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that song before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad,\r\nlaughing, as he continued to spur his steed onward in its wild career.\r\n\r\nThe barge-horse was not capable of any very sustained effort, and its\r\ngallop soon subsided into a trot, and its trot into an easy walk; but\r\nToad was quite contented with this, knowing that he, at any rate, was\r\nmoving, and the barge was not. He had quite recovered his temper, now\r\nthat he had done something he thought really clever; and he was\r\nsatisfied to jog along quietly in the sun, steering his horse along\r\nby-ways and bridle-paths, and trying to forget how very long it was\r\nsince he had had a square meal, till the canal had been left very far\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nHe had travelled some miles, his horse and he, and he was feeling\r\ndrowsy in the hot sunshine, when the horse stopped, lowered his head,\r\nand began to nibble the grass; and Toad, waking up, just saved himself\r\nfrom falling off by an effort. He looked about him and found he was on\r\na wide common, dotted with patches of gorse and bramble as far as he\r\ncould see. Near him stood a dingy gipsy caravan, and beside it a man\r\nwas sitting on a bucket turned upside down, very busy smoking and\r\nstaring into the wide world. A fire of sticks was burning near by, and\r\nover the fire hung an iron pot, and out of that pot came forth\r\nbubblings and gurglings, and a vague suggestive steaminess. Also\r\nsmells\xe2\x80\x94warm, rich, and varied smells\xe2\x80\x94that twined and twisted and\r\nwreathed themselves at last into one complete, voluptuous, perfect\r\nsmell that seemed like the very soul of Nature taking form and\r\nappearing to her children, a true Goddess, a mother of solace and\r\ncomfort. Toad now knew well that he had not been really hungry before.\r\nWhat he had felt earlier in the day had been a mere trifling qualm.\r\nThis was the real thing at last, and no mistake; and it would have to\r\nbe dealt with speedily, too, or there would be trouble for somebody or\r\nsomething. He looked the gipsy over carefully, wondering vaguely\r\nwhether it would be easier to fight him or cajole him. So there he sat,\r\nand sniffed and sniffed, and looked at the gipsy; and the gipsy sat and\r\nsmoked, and looked at him.\r\n\r\nPresently the gipsy took his pipe out of his mouth and remarked in a\r\ncareless way, \xe2\x80\x9cWant to sell that there horse of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad was completely taken aback. He did not know that gipsies were very\r\nfond of horse-dealing, and never missed an opportunity, and he had not\r\nreflected that caravans were always on the move and took a deal of\r\ndrawing. It had not occurred to him to turn the horse into cash, but\r\nthe gipsy\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion seemed to smooth the way towards the two things\r\nhe wanted so badly\xe2\x80\x94ready money, and a solid breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cme sell this beautiful young horse of mine? O, no;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s out of the question. Who\xe2\x80\x99s going to take the washing home to my\r\ncustomers every week? Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99m too fond of him, and he simply dotes\r\non me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and love a donkey,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the gipsy. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to see,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Toad, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this fine horse of mine\r\nis a cut above you altogether. He\xe2\x80\x99s a blood horse, he is, partly; not\r\nthe part you see, of course\xe2\x80\x94another part. And he\xe2\x80\x99s been a Prize\r\nHackney, too, in his time\xe2\x80\x94that was the time before you knew him, but\r\nyou can still tell it on him at a glance, if you understand anything\r\nabout horses. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not to be thought of for a moment. All the same,\r\nhow much might you be disposed to offer me for this beautiful young\r\nhorse of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gipsy looked the horse over, and then he looked Toad over with\r\nequal care, and looked at the horse again. \xe2\x80\x9cShillin\xe2\x80\x99 a leg,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nbriefly, and turned away, continuing to smoke and try to stare the wide\r\nworld out of countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA shilling a leg?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toad. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, I must take a little\r\ntime to work that out, and see just what it comes to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe climbed down off his horse, and left it to graze, and sat down by\r\nthe gipsy, and did sums on his fingers, and at last he said, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nshilling a leg? Why, that comes to exactly four shillings, and no more.\r\nO, no; I could not think of accepting four shillings for this beautiful\r\nyoung horse of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gipsy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I will do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it\r\nfive shillings, and that\xe2\x80\x99s three-and-sixpence more than the animal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworth. And that\xe2\x80\x99s my last word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Toad sat and pondered long and deeply. For he was hungry and quite\r\npenniless, and still some way\xe2\x80\x94he knew not how far\xe2\x80\x94from home, and\r\nenemies might still be looking for him. To one in such a situation,\r\nfive shillings may very well appear a large sum of money. On the other\r\nhand, it did not seem very much to get for a horse. But then, again,\r\nthe horse hadn\xe2\x80\x99t cost him anything; so whatever he got was all clear\r\nprofit. At last he said firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, gipsy! I tell you what we\r\nwill do; and this is _my_ last word. You shall hand me over six\r\nshillings and sixpence, cash down; and further, in addition thereto,\r\nyou shall give me as much breakfast as I can possibly eat, at one\r\nsitting of course, out of that iron pot of yours that keeps sending\r\nforth such delicious and exciting smells. In return, I will make over\r\nto you my spirited young horse, with all the beautiful harness and\r\ntrappings that are on him, freely thrown in. If that\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough\r\nfor you, say so, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting on. I know a man near here who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwanted this horse of mine for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gipsy grumbled frightfully, and declared if he did a few more deals\r\nof that sort he\xe2\x80\x99d be ruined. But in the end he lugged a dirty canvas\r\nbag out of the depths of his trouser pocket, and counted out six\r\nshillings and sixpence into Toad\xe2\x80\x99s paw. Then he disappeared into the\r\ncaravan for an instant, and returned with a large iron plate and a\r\nknife, fork, and spoon. He tilted up the pot, and a glorious stream of\r\nhot rich stew gurgled into the plate. It was, indeed, the most\r\nbeautiful stew in the world, being made of partridges, and pheasants,\r\nand chickens, and hares, and rabbits, and pea-hens, and guinea-fowls,\r\nand one or two other things. Toad took the plate on his lap, almost\r\ncrying, and stuffed, and stuffed, and stuffed, and kept asking for\r\nmore, and the gipsy never grudged it him. He thought that he had never\r\neaten so good a breakfast in all his life.\r\n\r\nWhen Toad had taken as much stew on board as he thought he could\r\npossibly hold, he got up and said good-bye to the gipsy, and took an\r\naffectionate farewell of the horse; and the gipsy, who knew the\r\nriverside well, gave him directions which way to go, and he set forth\r\non his travels again in the best possible spirits. He was, indeed, a\r\nvery different Toad from the animal of an hour ago. The sun was shining\r\nbrightly, his wet clothes were quite dry again, he had money in his\r\npocket once more, he was nearing home and friends and safety, and, most\r\nand best of all, he had had a substantial meal, hot and nourishing, and\r\nfelt big, and strong, and careless, and self-confident.\r\n\r\nAs he tramped along gaily, he thought of his adventures and escapes,\r\nand how when things seemed at their worst he had always managed to find\r\na way out; and his pride and conceit began to swell within him. \xe2\x80\x9cHo,\r\nho!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself as he marched along with his chin in the air,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat a clever Toad I am! There is surely no animal equal to me for\r\ncleverness in the whole world! My enemies shut me up in prison,\r\nencircled by sentries, watched night and day by warders; I walk out\r\nthrough them all, by sheer ability coupled with courage. They pursue me\r\nwith engines, and policemen, and revolvers; I snap my fingers at them,\r\nand vanish, laughing, into space. I am, unfortunately, thrown into a\r\ncanal by a woman fat of body and very evil-minded. What of it? I swim\r\nashore, I seize her horse, I ride off in triumph, and I sell the horse\r\nfor a whole pocketful of money and an excellent breakfast! Ho, ho! I am\r\nThe Toad, the handsome, the popular, the successful Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d He got so\r\npuffed up with conceit that he made up a song as he walked in praise of\r\nhimself, and sang it at the top of his voice, though there was no one\r\nto hear it but him. It was perhaps the most conceited song that any\r\nanimal ever composed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe world has held great Heroes,\r\n    As history-books have showed;\r\nBut never a name to go down to fame\r\n    Compared with that of Toad!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe clever men at Oxford\r\n    Know all that there is to be knowed.\r\nBut they none of them know one half as much\r\n    As intelligent Mr. Toad!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe animals sat in the Ark and cried,\r\n    Their tears in torrents flowed.\r\nWho was it said, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s land ahead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    Encouraging Mr. Toad!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe army all saluted\r\n    As they marched along the road.\r\nWas it the King? Or Kitchener?\r\n    No. It was Mr. Toad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Queen and her Ladies-in-waiting\r\n    Sat at the window and sewed.\r\nShe cried, \xe2\x80\x98Look! who\xe2\x80\x99s that _handsome_ man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n    They answered, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Toad.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal more of the same sort, but too dreadfully\r\nconceited to be written down. These are some of the milder verses.\r\n\r\nHe sang as he walked, and he walked as he sang, and got more inflated\r\nevery minute. But his pride was shortly to have a severe fall.\r\n\r\nAfter some miles of country lanes he reached the high road, and as he\r\nturned into it and glanced along its white length, he saw approaching\r\nhim a speck that turned into a dot and then into a blob, and then into\r\nsomething very familiar; and a double note of warning, only too well\r\nknown, fell on his delighted ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is something like!\xe2\x80\x9d said the excited Toad. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is real life\r\nagain, this is once more the great world from which I have been missed\r\nso long! I will hail them, my brothers of the wheel, and pitch them a\r\nyarn, of the sort that has been so successful hitherto; and they will\r\ngive me a lift, of course, and then I will talk to them some more; and,\r\nperhaps, with luck, it may even end in my driving up to Toad Hall in a\r\nmotor-car! That will be one in the eye for Badger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped confidently out into the road to hail the motor-car, which\r\ncame along at an easy pace, slowing down as it neared the lane; when\r\nsuddenly he became very pale, his heart turned to water, his knees\r\nshook and yielded under him, and he doubled up and collapsed with a\r\nsickening pain in his interior. And well he might, the unhappy animal;\r\nfor the approaching car was the very one he had stolen out of the yard\r\nof the Red Lion Hotel on that fatal day when all his troubles began!\r\nAnd the people in it were the very same people he had sat and watched\r\nat luncheon in the coffee-room!\r\n\r\nHe sank down in a shabby, miserable heap in the road, murmuring to\r\nhimself in his despair, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all up! It\xe2\x80\x99s all over now! Chains and\r\npolicemen again! Prison again! Dry bread and water again! O, what a\r\nfool I have been! What did I want to go strutting about the country\r\nfor, singing conceited songs, and hailing people in broad day on the\r\nhigh road, instead of hiding till nightfall and slipping home quietly\r\nby back ways! O hapless Toad! O ill-fated animal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe terrible motor-car drew slowly nearer and nearer, till at last he\r\nheard it stop just short of him. Two gentlemen got out and walked round\r\nthe trembling heap of crumpled misery lying in the road, and one of\r\nthem said, \xe2\x80\x9cO dear! this is very sad! Here is a poor old thing\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwasherwoman apparently\xe2\x80\x94who has fainted in the road! Perhaps she is\r\novercome by the heat, poor creature; or possibly she has not had any\r\nfood to-day. Let us lift her into the car and take her to the nearest\r\nvillage, where doubtless she has friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey tenderly lifted Toad into the motor-car and propped him up with\r\nsoft cushions, and proceeded on their way.\r\n\r\nWhen Toad heard them talk in so kind and sympathetic a way, and knew\r\nthat he was not recognised, his courage began to revive, and he\r\ncautiously opened first one eye and then the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the gentlemen, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is better already. The fresh\r\nair is doing her good. How do you feel now, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you kindly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad in a feeble voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a\r\ngreat deal better!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cNow keep quite\r\nstill, and, above all, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad. \xe2\x80\x9cI was only thinking, if I might sit on the front\r\nseat there, beside the driver, where I could get the fresh air full in\r\nmy face, I should soon be all right again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a very sensible woman!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\r\nshall.\xe2\x80\x9d So they carefully helped Toad into the front seat beside the\r\ndriver, and on they went again.\r\n\r\nToad was almost himself again by now. He sat up, looked about him, and\r\ntried to beat down the tremors, the yearnings, the old cravings that\r\nrose up and beset him and took possession of him entirely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is fate!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy strive? why struggle?\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nturned to the driver at his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would kindly let me try and drive\r\nthe car for a little. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching you carefully, and it looks so\r\neasy and so interesting, and I should like to be able to tell my\r\nfriends that once I had driven a motor-car!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe driver laughed at the proposal, so heartily that the gentleman\r\ninquired what the matter was. When he heard, he said, to Toad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelight, \xe2\x80\x9cBravo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! I like your spirit. Let her have a try, and\r\nlook after her. She won\xe2\x80\x99t do any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad eagerly scrambled into the seat vacated by the driver, took the\r\nsteering-wheel in his hands, listened with affected humility to the\r\ninstructions given him, and set the car in motion, but very slowly and\r\ncarefully at first, for he was determined to be prudent.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen behind clapped their hands and applauded, and Toad heard\r\nthem saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHow well she does it! Fancy a washerwoman driving a car\r\nas well as that, the first time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad went a little faster; then faster still, and faster.\r\n\r\nHe heard the gentlemen call out warningly, \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, washerwoman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd this annoyed him, and he began to lose his head.\r\n\r\nThe driver tried to interfere, but he pinned him down in his seat with\r\none elbow, and put on full speed. The rush of air in his face, the hum\r\nof the engines, and the light jump of the car beneath him intoxicated\r\nhis weak brain. \xe2\x80\x9cWasherwoman, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted recklessly. \xe2\x80\x9cHo! ho!\r\nI am the Toad, the motor-car snatcher, the prison-breaker, the Toad who\r\nalways escapes! Sit still, and you shall know what driving really is,\r\nfor you are in the hands of the famous, the skilful, the entirely\r\nfearless Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a cry of horror the whole party rose and flung themselves on him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeize him!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried, \xe2\x80\x9cseize the Toad, the wicked animal who stole\r\nour motor-car! Bind him, chain him, drag him to the nearest\r\npolice-station! Down with the desperate and dangerous Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlas! they should have thought, they ought to have been more prudent,\r\nthey should have remembered to stop the motor-car somehow before\r\nplaying any pranks of that sort. With a half-turn of the wheel the Toad\r\nsent the car crashing through the low hedge that ran along the\r\nroadside. One mighty bound, a violent shock, and the wheels of the car\r\nwere churning up the thick mud of a horse-pond.\r\n\r\nToad found himself flying through the air with the strong upward rush\r\nand delicate curve of a swallow. He liked the motion, and was just\r\nbeginning to wonder whether it would go on until he developed wings and\r\nturned into a Toad-bird, when he landed on his back with a thump, in\r\nthe soft rich grass of a meadow. Sitting up, he could just see the\r\nmotor-car in the pond, nearly submerged; the gentlemen and the driver,\r\nencumbered by their long coats, were floundering helplessly in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nHe picked himself up rapidly, and set off running across country as\r\nhard as he could, scrambling through hedges, jumping ditches, pounding\r\nacross fields, till he was breathless and weary, and had to settle down\r\ninto an easy walk. When he had recovered his breath somewhat, and was\r\nable to think calmly, he began to giggle, and from giggling he took to\r\nlaughing, and he laughed till he had to sit down under a hedge. \xe2\x80\x9cHo,\r\nho!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, in ecstasies of self-admiration, \xe2\x80\x9cToad again! Toad, as\r\nusual, comes out on the top! Who was it got them to give him a lift?\r\nWho managed to get on the front seat for the sake of fresh air? Who\r\npersuaded them into letting him see if he could drive? Who landed them\r\nall in a horse-pond? Who escaped, flying gaily and unscathed through\r\nthe air, leaving the narrow-minded, grudging, timid excursionists in\r\nthe mud where they should rightly be? Why, Toad, of course; clever\r\nToad, great Toad, _good_ Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he burst into song again, and chanted with uplifted voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe motor-car went Poop-poop-poop,\r\n    As it raced along the road.\r\nWho was it steered it into a pond?\r\n    Ingenious Mr. Toad!\r\n\r\n\r\nO, how clever I am! How clever, how clever, how very clev\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight noise at a distance behind him made him turn his head and\r\nlook. O horror! O misery! O despair!\r\n\r\nAbout two fields off, a chauffeur in his leather gaiters and two large\r\nrural policemen were visible, running towards him as hard as they could\r\ngo!\r\n\r\nPoor Toad sprang to his feet and pelted away again, his heart in his\r\nmouth. O, my!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped, as he panted along, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat an _ass_ I am! What\r\na _conceited_ and heedless ass! Swaggering again! Shouting and singing\r\nsongs again! Sitting still and gassing again! O my! O my! O my!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced back, and saw to his dismay that they were gaining on him.\r\nOn he ran desperately, but kept looking back, and saw that they still\r\ngained steadily. He did his best, but he was a fat animal, and his legs\r\nwere short, and still they gained. He could hear them close behind him\r\nnow. Ceasing to heed where he was going, he struggled on blindly and\r\nwildly, looking back over his shoulder at the now triumphant enemy,\r\nwhen suddenly the earth failed under his feet, he grasped at the air,\r\nand, splash! he found himself head over ears in deep water, rapid\r\nwater, water that bore him along with a force he could not contend\r\nwith; and he knew that in his blind panic he had run straight into the\r\nriver!\r\n\r\nHe rose to the surface and tried to grasp the reeds and the rushes that\r\ngrew along the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge close under the bank, but the stream was so\r\nstrong that it tore them out of his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cO my!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped poor Toad,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif ever I steal a motor-car again! If ever I sing another conceited\r\nsong\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then down he went, and came up breathless and spluttering.\r\nPresently he saw that he was approaching a big dark hole in the bank,\r\njust above his head, and as the stream bore him past he reached up with\r\na paw and caught hold of the edge and held on. Then slowly and with\r\ndifficulty he drew himself up out of the water, till at last he was\r\nable to rest his elbows on the edge of the hole. There he remained for\r\nsome minutes, puffing and panting, for he was quite exhausted.\r\n\r\nAs he sighed and blew and stared before him into the dark hole, some\r\nbright small thing shone and twinkled in its depths, moving towards\r\nhim. As it approached, a face grew up gradually around it, and it was a\r\nfamiliar face!\r\n\r\nBrown and small, with whiskers.\r\n\r\nGrave and round, with neat ears and silky hair.\r\n\r\nIt was the Water Rat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLIKE SUMMER TEMPESTS CAME HIS TEARS\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rat put out a neat little brown paw, gripped Toad firmly by the\r\nscruff of the neck, and gave a great hoist and a pull; and the\r\nwater-logged Toad came up slowly but surely over the edge of the hole,\r\ntill at last he stood safe and sound in the hall, streaked with mud and\r\nweed to be sure, and with the water streaming off him, but happy and\r\nhigh-spirited as of old, now that he found himself once more in the\r\nhouse of a friend, and dodgings and evasions were over, and he could\r\nlay aside a disguise that was unworthy of his position and wanted such\r\na lot of living up to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Ratty!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been through such times since I saw you\r\nlast, you can\xe2\x80\x99t think! Such trials, such sufferings, and all so nobly\r\nborne! Then such escapes, such disguises such subterfuges, and all so\r\ncleverly planned and carried out! Been in prison\xe2\x80\x94got out of it, of\r\ncourse! Been thrown into a canal\xe2\x80\x94swam ashore! Stole a horse\xe2\x80\x94sold him\r\nfor a large sum of money! Humbugged everybody\xe2\x80\x94made \xe2\x80\x99em all do exactly\r\nwhat I wanted! Oh, I _am_ a smart Toad, and no mistake! What do you\r\nthink my last exploit was? Just hold on till I tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Water Rat, gravely and firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou go off upstairs at\r\nonce, and take off that old cotton rag that looks as if it might\r\nformerly have belonged to some washerwoman, and clean yourself\r\nthoroughly, and put on some of my clothes, and try and come down\r\nlooking like a gentleman if you _can;_ for a more shabby, bedraggled,\r\ndisreputable-looking object than you are I never set eyes on in my\r\nwhole life! Now, stop swaggering and arguing, and be off! I\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nsomething to say to you later!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad was at first inclined to stop and do some talking back at him. He\r\nhad had enough of being ordered about when he was in prison, and here\r\nwas the thing being begun all over again, apparently; and by a Rat,\r\ntoo! However, he caught sight of himself in the looking-glass over the\r\nhat-stand, with the rusty black bonnet perched rakishly over one eye,\r\nand he changed his mind and went very quickly and humbly upstairs to\r\nthe Rat\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room. There he had a thorough wash and brush-up,\r\nchanged his clothes, and stood for a long time before the glass,\r\ncontemplating himself with pride and pleasure, and thinking what utter\r\nidiots all the people must have been to have ever mistaken him for one\r\nmoment for a washerwoman.\r\n\r\nBy the time he came down again luncheon was on the table, and very glad\r\nToad was to see it, for he had been through some trying experiences and\r\nhad taken much hard exercise since the excellent breakfast provided for\r\nhim by the gipsy. While they ate Toad told the Rat all his adventures,\r\ndwelling chiefly on his own cleverness, and presence of mind in\r\nemergencies, and cunning in tight places; and rather making out that he\r\nhad been having a gay and highly-coloured experience. But the more he\r\ntalked and boasted, the more grave and silent the Rat became.\r\n\r\nWhen at last Toad had talked himself to a standstill, there was silence\r\nfor a while; and then the Rat said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Toady, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give\r\nyou pain, after all you\xe2\x80\x99ve been through already; but, seriously, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see what an awful ass you\xe2\x80\x99ve been making of yourself? On your own\r\nadmission you have been handcuffed, imprisoned, starved, chased,\r\nterrified out of your life, insulted, jeered at, and ignominiously\r\nflung into the water\xe2\x80\x94by a woman, too! Where\xe2\x80\x99s the amusement in that?\r\nWhere does the fun come in? And all because you must needs go and steal\r\na motor-car. You know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve never had anything but trouble from\r\nmotor-cars from the moment you first set eyes on one. But if you _will_\r\nbe mixed up with them\xe2\x80\x94as you generally are, five minutes after you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nstarted\xe2\x80\x94why _steal_ them? Be a cripple, if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s exciting; be\r\na bankrupt, for a change, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve set your mind on it: but why choose\r\nto be a convict? When are you going to be sensible, and think of your\r\nfriends, and try and be a credit to them? Do you suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s any\r\npleasure to me, for instance, to hear animals saying, as I go about,\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m the chap that keeps company with gaol-birds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, it was a very comforting point in Toad\xe2\x80\x99s character that he was a\r\nthoroughly good-hearted animal and never minded being jawed by those\r\nwho were his real friends. And even when most set upon a thing, he was\r\nalways able to see the other side of the question. So although, while\r\nthe Rat was talking so seriously, he kept saying to himself mutinously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it _was_ fun, though! Awful fun!\xe2\x80\x9d and making strange suppressed\r\nnoises inside him, k-i-ck-ck-ck, and poop-p-p, and other sounds\r\nresembling stifled snorts, or the opening of soda-water bottles, yet\r\nwhen the Rat had quite finished, he heaved a deep sigh and said, very\r\nnicely and humbly, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, Ratty! How _sound_ you always are!\r\nYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a conceited old ass, I can quite see that; but now I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to be a good Toad, and not do it any more. As for motor-cars,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve not been at all so keen about them since my last ducking in that\r\nriver of yours. The fact is, while I was hanging on to the edge of your\r\nhole and getting my breath, I had a sudden idea\xe2\x80\x94a really brilliant\r\nidea\xe2\x80\x94connected with motor-boats\xe2\x80\x94there, there! don\xe2\x80\x99t take on so, old\r\nchap, and stamp, and upset things; it was only an idea, and we won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalk any more about it now. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have our coffee, _and_ a smoke, and a\r\nquiet chat, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stroll quietly down to Toad Hall, and\r\nget into clothes of my own, and set things going again on the old\r\nlines. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of adventures. I shall lead a quiet, steady,\r\nrespectable life, pottering about my property, and improving it, and\r\ndoing a little landscape gardening at times. There will always be a bit\r\nof dinner for my friends when they come to see me; and I shall keep a\r\npony-chaise to jog about the country in, just as I used to in the good\r\nold days, before I got restless, and wanted to _do_ things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStroll quietly down to Toad Hall?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Rat, greatly excited.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about? Do you mean to say you haven\xe2\x80\x99t _heard?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeard what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, turning rather pale. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Ratty! Quick!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t spare me! What haven\xe2\x80\x99t I heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Rat, thumping with his little\r\nfist upon the table, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard nothing about the Stoats and\r\nWeasels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat, the Wild Wooders?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toad, trembling in every limb. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not\r\na word! What have they been doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94And how they\xe2\x80\x99ve been and taken Toad Hall?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Rat.\r\n\r\nToad leaned his elbows on the table, and his chin on his paws; and a\r\nlarge tear welled up in each of his eyes, overflowed and splashed on\r\nthe table, plop! plop!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Ratty,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured presently; \xe2\x80\x9ctell me all. The worst is over.\r\nI am an animal again. I can bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x94got\xe2\x80\x94into that\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94trouble of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, slowly\r\nand impressively; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, when you\xe2\x80\x94disappeared from society for a\r\ntime, over that misunderstanding about a\xe2\x80\x94a machine, you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad merely nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was a good deal talked about down here, naturally,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe Rat, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only along the river-side, but even in the Wild Wood.\r\nAnimals took sides, as always happens. The River-bankers stuck up for\r\nyou, and said you had been infamously treated, and there was no justice\r\nto be had in the land nowadays. But the Wild Wood animals said hard\r\nthings, and served you right, and it was time this sort of thing was\r\nstopped. And they got very cocky, and went about saying you were done\r\nfor this time! You would never come back again, never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad nodded once more, keeping silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of little beasts they are,\xe2\x80\x9d the Rat went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Mole\r\nand Badger, they stuck out, through thick and thin, that you would come\r\nback again soon, somehow. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly how, but somehow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad began to sit up in his chair again, and to smirk a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey argued from history,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cThey said that no\r\ncriminal laws had ever been known to prevail against cheek and\r\nplausibility such as yours, combined with the power of a long purse. So\r\nthey arranged to move their things in to Toad Hall, and sleep there,\r\nand keep it aired, and have it all ready for you when you turned up.\r\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t guess what was going to happen, of course; still, they had\r\ntheir suspicions of the Wild Wood animals. Now I come to the most\r\npainful and tragic part of my story. One dark night\xe2\x80\x94it was a _very_\r\ndark night, and blowing hard, too, and raining simply cats and dogs\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nband of weasels, armed to the teeth, crept silently up the\r\ncarriage-drive to the front entrance. Simultaneously, a body of\r\ndesperate ferrets, advancing through the kitchen-garden, possessed\r\nthemselves of the backyard and offices; while a company of skirmishing\r\nstoats who stuck at nothing occupied the conservatory and the\r\nbilliard-room, and held the French windows opening on to the lawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mole and the Badger were sitting by the fire in the smoking-room,\r\ntelling stories and suspecting nothing, for it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a night for any\r\nanimals to be out in, when those bloodthirsty villains broke down the\r\ndoors and rushed in upon them from every side. They made the best fight\r\nthey could, but what was the good? They were unarmed, and taken by\r\nsurprise, and what can two animals do against hundreds? They took and\r\nbeat them severely with sticks, those two poor faithful creatures, and\r\nturned them out into the cold and the wet, with many insulting and\r\nuncalled-for remarks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the unfeeling Toad broke into a snigger, and then pulled himself\r\ntogether and tried to look particularly solemn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Wild Wooders have been living in Toad Hall ever since,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the Rat; \xe2\x80\x9cand going on simply anyhow! Lying in bed half the\r\nday, and breakfast at all hours, and the place in such a mess (I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntold) it\xe2\x80\x99s not fit to be seen! Eating your grub, and drinking your\r\ndrink, and making bad jokes about you, and singing vulgar songs,\r\nabout\xe2\x80\x94well, about prisons and magistrates, and policemen; horrid\r\npersonal songs, with no humour in them. And they\xe2\x80\x99re telling the\r\ntradespeople and everybody that they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to stay for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, have they!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad getting up and seizing a stick. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll jolly\r\nsoon see about that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good, Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d called the Rat after him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better come back\r\nand sit down; you\xe2\x80\x99ll only get into trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Toad was off, and there was no holding him. He marched rapidly\r\ndown the road, his stick over his shoulder, fuming and muttering to\r\nhimself in his anger, till he got near his front gate, when suddenly\r\nthere popped up from behind the palings a long yellow ferret with a\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho comes there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the ferret sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, very angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by\r\ntalking like that to me? Come out of that at once, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ferret said never a word, but he brought his gun up to his\r\nshoulder. Toad prudently dropped flat in the road, and _Bang!_ a bullet\r\nwhistled over his head.\r\n\r\nThe startled Toad scrambled to his feet and scampered off down the road\r\nas hard as he could; and as he ran he heard the ferret laughing and\r\nother horrid thin little laughs taking it up and carrying on the sound.\r\n\r\nHe went back, very crestfallen, and told the Water Rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nsentries posted, and they are all armed. You must just wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, Toad was not inclined to give in all at once. So he got out the\r\nboat, and set off rowing up the river to where the garden front of Toad\r\nHall came down to the waterside.\r\n\r\nArriving within sight of his old home, he rested on his oars and\r\nsurveyed the land cautiously. All seemed very peaceful and deserted and\r\nquiet. He could see the whole front of Toad Hall, glowing in the\r\nevening sunshine, the pigeons settling by twos and threes along the\r\nstraight line of the roof; the garden, a blaze of flowers; the creek\r\nthat led up to the boat-house, the little wooden bridge that crossed\r\nit; all tranquil, uninhabited, apparently waiting for his return. He\r\nwould try the boat-house first, he thought. Very warily he paddled up\r\nto the mouth of the creek, and was just passing under the bridge, when\r\n... _Crash!_\r\n\r\nA great stone, dropped from above, smashed through the bottom of the\r\nboat. It filled and sank, and Toad found himself struggling in deep\r\nwater. Looking up, he saw two stoats leaning over the parapet of the\r\nbridge and watching him with great glee. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be your head next\r\ntime, Toady!\xe2\x80\x9d they called out to him. The indignant Toad swam to shore,\r\nwhile the stoats laughed and laughed, supporting each other, and\r\nlaughed again, till they nearly had two fits\xe2\x80\x94that is, one fit each, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe Toad retraced his weary way on foot, and related his disappointing\r\nexperiences to the Water Rat once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _what_ did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat very crossly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, now,\r\nlook here! See what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been and done! Lost me my boat that I was so\r\nfond of, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done! And simply ruined that nice suit of\r\nclothes that I lent you! Really, Toad, of all the trying animals\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwonder you manage to keep any friends at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Toad saw at once how wrongly and foolishly he had acted. He\r\nadmitted his errors and wrong-headedness and made a full apology to Rat\r\nfor losing his boat and spoiling his clothes. And he wound up by\r\nsaying, with that frank self-surrender which always disarmed his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s criticism and won them back to his side, \xe2\x80\x9cRatty! I see that I\r\nhave been a headstrong and a wilful Toad! Henceforth, believe me, I\r\nwill be humble and submissive, and will take no action without your\r\nkind advice and full approval!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is really so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good-natured Rat, already appeased,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthen my advice to you is, considering the lateness of the hour, to sit\r\ndown and have your supper, which will be on the table in a minute, and\r\nbe very patient. For I am convinced that we can do nothing until we\r\nhave seen the Mole and the Badger, and heard their latest news, and\r\nheld conference and taken their advice in this difficult matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ah, yes, of course, the Mole and the Badger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, lightly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s become of them, the dear fellows? I had forgotten all about\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell may you ask!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile you were riding\r\nabout the country in expensive motor-cars, and galloping proudly on\r\nblood-horses, and breakfasting on the fat of the land, those two poor\r\ndevoted animals have been camping out in the open, in every sort of\r\nweather, living very rough by day and lying very hard by night;\r\nwatching over your house, patrolling your boundaries, keeping a\r\nconstant eye on the stoats and the weasels, scheming and planning and\r\ncontriving how to get your property back for you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to\r\nhave such true and loyal friends, Toad, you don\xe2\x80\x99t, really. Some day,\r\nwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s too late, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry you didn\xe2\x80\x99t value them more while\r\nyou had them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an ungrateful beast, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Toad, shedding bitter tears.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go out and find them, out into the cold, dark night, and share\r\ntheir hardships, and try and prove by\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Hold on a bit! Surely I heard\r\nthe chink of dishes on a tray! Supper\xe2\x80\x99s here at last, hooray! Come on,\r\nRatty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat remembered that poor Toad had been on prison fare for a\r\nconsiderable time, and that large allowances had therefore to be made.\r\nHe followed him to the table accordingly, and hospitably encouraged him\r\nin his gallant efforts to make up for past privations.\r\n\r\nThey had just finished their meal and resumed their arm-chairs, when\r\nthere came a heavy knock at the door.\r\n\r\nToad was nervous, but the Rat, nodding mysteriously at him, went\r\nstraight up to the door and opened it, and in walked Mr. Badger.\r\n\r\nHe had all the appearance of one who for some nights had been kept away\r\nfrom home and all its little comforts and conveniences. His shoes were\r\ncovered with mud, and he was looking very rough and touzled; but then\r\nhe had never been a very smart man, the Badger, at the best of times.\r\nHe came solemnly up to Toad, shook him by the paw, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome\r\nhome, Toad! Alas! what am I saying? Home, indeed! This is a poor\r\nhome-coming. Unhappy Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he turned his back on him, sat down to\r\nthe table, drew his chair up, and helped himself to a large slice of\r\ncold pie.\r\n\r\nToad was quite alarmed at this very serious and portentous style of\r\ngreeting; but the Rat whispered to him, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; don\xe2\x80\x99t take any\r\nnotice; and don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to him just yet. He\xe2\x80\x99s always rather low\r\nand despondent when he\xe2\x80\x99s wanting his victuals. In half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite a different animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they waited in silence, and presently there came another and a\r\nlighter knock. The Rat, with a nod to Toad, went to the door and\r\nushered in the Mole, very shabby and unwashed, with bits of hay and\r\nstraw sticking in his fur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray! Here\xe2\x80\x99s old Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Mole, his face beaming. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy\r\nhaving you back again!\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to dance round him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe never\r\ndreamt you would turn up so soon! Why, you must have managed to escape,\r\nyou clever, ingenious, intelligent Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rat, alarmed, pulled him by the elbow; but it was too late. Toad\r\nwas puffing and swelling already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClever? O, no!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not really clever, according to my\r\nfriends. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only broken out of the strongest prison in England,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all! And captured a railway train and escaped on it, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\r\nAnd disguised myself and gone about the country humbugging everybody,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all! O, no! I\xe2\x80\x99m a stupid ass, I am! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one or two of\r\nmy little adventures, Mole, and you shall judge for yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, moving towards the supper-table;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csupposing you talk while I eat. Not a bite since breakfast! O my! O\r\nmy!\xe2\x80\x9d And he sat down and helped himself liberally to cold beef and\r\npickles.\r\n\r\nToad straddled on the hearth-rug, thrust his paw into his\r\ntrouser-pocket and pulled out a handful of silver. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at that!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, displaying it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad, is it, for a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwork? And how do you think I done it, Mole? Horse-dealing! That\xe2\x80\x99s how I\r\ndone it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole, immensely interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad, do be quiet, please!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you egg him on,\r\nMole, when you know what he is; but please tell us as soon as possible\r\nwhat the position is, and what\xe2\x80\x99s best to be done, now that Toad is back\r\nat last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe position\xe2\x80\x99s about as bad as it can be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Mole grumpily;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand as for what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done, why, blest if I know! The Badger and I\r\nhave been round and round the place, by night and by day; always the\r\nsame thing. Sentries posted everywhere, guns poked out at us, stones\r\nthrown at us; always an animal on the look-out, and when they see us,\r\nmy! how they do laugh! That\xe2\x80\x99s what annoys me most!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very difficult situation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, reflecting deeply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I see now, in the depths of my mind, what Toad really\r\nought to do. I will tell you. He ought to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Mole, with his mouth full. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing of\r\nthe sort! You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. What he ought to do is, he ought to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t do it, anyway!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toad, getting excited. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ngoing to be ordered about by you fellows! It\xe2\x80\x99s my house we\xe2\x80\x99re talking\r\nabout, and I know exactly what to do, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time they were all three talking at once, at the top of their\r\nvoices, and the noise was simply deafening, when a thin, dry voice made\r\nitself heard, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet at once, all of you!\xe2\x80\x9d and instantly\r\nevery one was silent.\r\n\r\nIt was the Badger, who, having finished his pie, had turned round in\r\nhis chair and was looking at them severely. When he saw that he had\r\nsecured their attention, and that they were evidently waiting for him\r\nto address them, he turned back to the table again and reached out for\r\nthe cheese. And so great was the respect commanded by the solid\r\nqualities of that admirable animal, that not another word was uttered\r\nuntil he had quite finished his repast and brushed the crumbs from his\r\nknees. The Toad fidgeted a good deal, but the Rat held him firmly down.\r\n\r\nWhen the Badger had quite done, he got up from his seat and stood\r\nbefore the fireplace, reflecting deeply. At last he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad!\xe2\x80\x9d he said severely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou bad, troublesome little animal! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou ashamed of yourself? What do you think your father, my old friend,\r\nwould have said if he had been here to-night, and had known of all your\r\ngoings on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad, who was on the sofa by this time, with his legs up, rolled over\r\non his face, shaken by sobs of contrition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there!\xe2\x80\x9d went on the Badger, more kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. Stop\r\ncrying. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to let bygones be bygones, and try and turn over a\r\nnew leaf. But what the Mole says is quite true. The stoats are on\r\nguard, at every point, and they make the best sentinels in the world.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite useless to think of attacking the place. They\xe2\x80\x99re too strong\r\nfor us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s all over,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed the Toad, crying into the sofa cushions.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go and enlist for a soldier, and never see my dear Toad Hall\r\nany more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, cheer up, Toady!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are more ways of\r\ngetting back a place than taking it by storm. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t said my last\r\nword yet. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you a great secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad sat up slowly and dried his eyes. Secrets had an immense\r\nattraction for him, because he never could keep one, and he enjoyed the\r\nsort of unhallowed thrill he experienced when he went and told another\r\nanimal, after having faithfully promised not to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x94underground\xe2\x80\x94passage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, impressively, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nleads from the river-bank, quite near here, right up into the middle of\r\nToad Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, nonsense! Badger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, rather airily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening\r\nto some of the yarns they spin in the public-houses about here. I know\r\nevery inch of Toad Hall, inside and out. Nothing of the sort, I do\r\nassure you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, with great severity, \xe2\x80\x9cyour father,\r\nwho was a worthy animal\xe2\x80\x94a lot worthier than some others I know\xe2\x80\x94was a\r\nparticular friend of mine, and told me a great deal he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ndreamt of telling you. He discovered that passage\xe2\x80\x94he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it, of\r\ncourse; that was done hundreds of years before he ever came to live\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94and he repaired it and cleaned it out, because he thought it\r\nmight come in useful some day, in case of trouble or danger; and he\r\nshowed it to me. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let my son know about it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngood boy, but very light and volatile in character, and simply cannot\r\nhold his tongue. If he\xe2\x80\x99s ever in a real fix, and it would be of use to\r\nhim, you may tell him about the secret passage; but not before.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other animals looked hard at Toad to see how he would take it. Toad\r\nwas inclined to be sulky at first; but he brightened up immediately,\r\nlike the good fellow he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I am a bit of a talker. A popular\r\nfellow such as I am\xe2\x80\x94my friends get round me\xe2\x80\x94we chaff, we sparkle, we\r\ntell witty stories\xe2\x80\x94and somehow my tongue gets wagging. I have the gift\r\nof conversation. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told I ought to have a _salon_, whatever\r\nthat may be. Never mind. Go on, Badger. How\xe2\x80\x99s this passage of yours\r\ngoing to help us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve found out a thing or two lately,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Badger. \xe2\x80\x9cI got\r\nOtter to disguise himself as a sweep and call at the back-door with\r\nbrushes over his shoulder, asking for a job. There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a big\r\nbanquet to-morrow night. It\xe2\x80\x99s somebody\xe2\x80\x99s birthday\xe2\x80\x94the Chief Weasel\xe2\x80\x99s, I\r\nbelieve\xe2\x80\x94and all the weasels will be gathered together in the\r\ndining-hall, eating and drinking and laughing and carrying on,\r\nsuspecting nothing. No guns, no swords, no sticks, no arms of any sort\r\nwhatever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the sentinels will be posted as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is my point. The weasels will trust\r\nentirely to their excellent sentinels. And that is where the passage\r\ncomes in. That very useful tunnel leads right up under the butler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npantry, next to the dining-hall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! that squeaky board in the butler\xe2\x80\x99s pantry!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\r\nunderstand it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall creep out quietly into the butler\xe2\x80\x99s pantry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Mole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94with our pistols and swords and sticks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Rat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and rush in upon them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and whack \xe2\x80\x99em, and whack \xe2\x80\x99em, and whack \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Toad in\r\necstasy, running round and round the room, and jumping over the chairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, resuming his usual dry manner, \xe2\x80\x9cour\r\nplan is settled, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more for you to argue and squabble\r\nabout. So, as it\xe2\x80\x99s getting very late, all of you go right off to bed at\r\nonce. We will make all the necessary arrangements in the course of the\r\nmorning to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad, of course, went off to bed dutifully with the rest\xe2\x80\x94he knew better\r\nthan to refuse\xe2\x80\x94though he was feeling much too excited to sleep. But he\r\nhad had a long day, with many events crowded into it; and sheets and\r\nblankets were very friendly and comforting things, after plain straw,\r\nand not too much of it, spread on the stone floor of a draughty cell;\r\nand his head had not been many seconds on his pillow before he was\r\nsnoring happily. Naturally, he dreamt a good deal; about roads that ran\r\naway from him just when he wanted them, and canals that chased him and\r\ncaught him, and a barge that sailed into the banqueting-hall with his\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s washing, just as he was giving a dinner-party; and he was alone\r\nin the secret passage, pushing onwards, but it twisted and turned round\r\nand shook itself, and sat up on its end; yet somehow, at the last, he\r\nfound himself back in Toad Hall, safe and triumphant, with all his\r\nfriends gathered round about him, earnestly assuring him that he really\r\nwas a clever Toad.\r\n\r\nHe slept till a late hour next morning, and by the time he got down he\r\nfound that the other animals had finished their breakfast some time\r\nbefore. The Mole had slipped off somewhere by himself, without telling\r\nany one where he was going to. The Badger sat in the arm-chair, reading\r\nthe paper, and not concerning himself in the slightest about what was\r\ngoing to happen that very evening. The Rat, on the other hand, was\r\nrunning round the room busily, with his arms full of weapons of every\r\nkind, distributing them in four little heaps on the floor, and saying\r\nexcitedly under his breath, as he ran, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s-a-sword-for-the-Rat,\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s-a-sword-for-the Mole, here\xe2\x80\x99s-a-sword-for-the-Toad,\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s-a-sword-for-the-Badger! Here\xe2\x80\x99s-a-pistol-for-the-Rat,\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s-a-pistol-for-the-Mole, here\xe2\x80\x99s-a-pistol-for-the-Toad,\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s-a-pistol-for-the-Badger!\xe2\x80\x9d And so on, in a regular, rhythmical\r\nway, while the four little heaps gradually grew and grew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well, Rat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger presently, looking at the\r\nbusy little animal over the edge of his newspaper; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not blaming\r\nyou. But just let us once get past the stoats, with those detestable\r\nguns of theirs, and I assure you we shan\xe2\x80\x99t want any swords or pistols.\r\nWe four, with our sticks, once we\xe2\x80\x99re inside the dining-hall, why, we\r\nshall clear the floor of all the lot of them in five minutes. I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\ndone the whole thing by myself, only I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to deprive you\r\nfellows of the fun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as well to be on the safe side,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat reflectively,\r\npolishing a pistol-barrel on his sleeve and looking along it.\r\n\r\nThe Toad, having finished his breakfast, picked up a stout stick and\r\nswung it vigorously, belabouring imaginary animals. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll learn \xe2\x80\x99em to\r\nsteal my house!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll learn \xe2\x80\x99em, I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98learn \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x99 Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, greatly shocked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\ngood English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you always nagging at Toad for?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Badger, rather\r\npeevishly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with his English? It\xe2\x80\x99s the same what I\r\nuse myself, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for me, it ought to be good enough\r\nfor you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat humbly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I _think_ it ought to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x98teach \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x99 not \xe2\x80\x98learn \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we don\xe2\x80\x99t _want_ to teach \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Badger. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to\r\n_learn_ \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94learn \xe2\x80\x99em, learn \xe2\x80\x99em! And what\xe2\x80\x99s more, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to _do_\r\nit, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well, have it your own way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. He was getting\r\nrather muddled about it himself, and presently he retired into a\r\ncorner, where he could be heard muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cLearn \xe2\x80\x99em, teach \xe2\x80\x99em, teach\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, learn \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d till the Badger told him rather sharply to leave off.\r\n\r\nPresently the Mole came tumbling into the room, evidently very pleased\r\nwith himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been having such fun!\xe2\x80\x9d he began at once; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ngetting a rise out of the stoats!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve been very careful, Mole?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope so, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mole confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cI got the idea\r\nwhen I went into the kitchen, to see about Toad\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast being kept\r\nhot for him. I found that old washerwoman-dress that he came home in\r\nyesterday, hanging on a towel-horse before the fire. So I put it on,\r\nand the bonnet as well, and the shawl, and off I went to Toad Hall, as\r\nbold as you please. The sentries were on the look-out, of course, with\r\ntheir guns and their \xe2\x80\x98Who comes there?\xe2\x80\x99 and all the rest of their\r\nnonsense. \xe2\x80\x98Good morning, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x99 says I, very respectful. \xe2\x80\x98Want any\r\nwashing done to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey looked at me very proud and stiff and haughty, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Go\r\naway, washerwoman! We don\xe2\x80\x99t do any washing on duty.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Or any other\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x99 says I. Ho, ho, ho! Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I _funny_, Toad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor, frivolous animal!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toad, very loftily. The fact is, he felt\r\nexceedingly jealous of Mole for what he had just done. It was exactly\r\nwhat he would have liked to have done himself, if only he had thought\r\nof it first, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone and overslept himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the stoats turned quite pink,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Mole, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nSergeant in charge, he said to me, very short, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Now run away,\r\nmy good woman, run away! Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep my men idling and talking on their\r\nposts.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Run away?\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98it won\xe2\x80\x99t be me that\xe2\x80\x99ll be running away, in\r\na very short time from now!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO _Moly_, how could you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, dismayed.\r\n\r\nThe Badger laid down his paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could see them pricking up their ears and looking at each other,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwent on the Mole; \xe2\x80\x9cand the Sergeant said to them, \xe2\x80\x98Never mind _her;_\r\nshe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98O! don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, let me tell you this. My daughter, she\r\nwashes for Mr. Badger, and that\xe2\x80\x99ll show you whether I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntalking about; and _you>\xe2\x80\x99ll_ know pretty soon, too! A hundred\r\nbloodthirsty badgers, armed with rifles, are going to attack Toad Hall\r\nthis very night, by way of the paddock. Six boatloads of Rats, with\r\npistols and cutlasses, will come up the river and effect a landing in\r\nthe garden; while a picked body of Toads, known at the Die-hards, or\r\nthe Death-or-Glory Toads, will storm the orchard and carry everything\r\nbefore them, yelling for vengeance. There won\xe2\x80\x99t be much left of you to\r\nwash, by the time they\xe2\x80\x99ve done with you, unless you clear out while you\r\nhave the chance!\xe2\x80\x99 Then I ran away, and when I was out of sight I hid;\r\nand presently I came creeping back along the ditch and took a peep at\r\nthem through the hedge. They were all as nervous and flustered as could\r\nbe, running all ways at once, and falling over each other, and every\r\none giving orders to everybody else and not listening; and the Sergeant\r\nkept sending off parties of stoats to distant parts of the grounds, and\r\nthen sending other fellows to fetch \xe2\x80\x99em back again; and I heard them\r\nsaying to each other, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s just like the weasels; they\xe2\x80\x99re to stop\r\ncomfortably in the banqueting-hall, and have feasting and toasts and\r\nsongs and all sorts of fun, while we must stay on guard in the cold and\r\nthe dark, and in the end be cut to pieces by bloodthirsty Badgers!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you silly ass, Mole!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toad, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been and spoilt\r\neverything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMole,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, in his dry, quiet way, \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive you have\r\nmore sense in your little finger than some other animals have in the\r\nwhole of their fat bodies. You have managed excellently, and I begin to\r\nhave great hopes of you. Good Mole! Clever Mole!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Toad was simply wild with jealousy, more especially as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake out for the life of him what the Mole had done that was so\r\nparticularly clever; but, fortunately for him, before he could show\r\ntemper or expose himself to the Badger\xe2\x80\x99s sarcasm, the bell rang for\r\nluncheon.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple but sustaining meal\xe2\x80\x94bacon and broad beans, and a\r\nmacaroni pudding; and when they had quite done, the Badger settled\r\nhimself into an arm-chair, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got our work cut out\r\nfor us to-night, and it will probably be pretty late before we\xe2\x80\x99re quite\r\nthrough with it; so I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to take forty winks, while I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he drew a handkerchief over his face and was soon snoring.\r\n\r\nThe anxious and laborious Rat at once resumed his preparations, and\r\nstarted running between his four little heaps, muttering,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s-a-belt-for-the-Rat, here\xe2\x80\x99s-a-belt-for-the-Mole,\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s-a-belt-for-the-Toad, here\xe2\x80\x99s-a-belt-for-the-Badger!\xe2\x80\x9d and so on,\r\nwith every fresh accoutrement he produced, to which there seemed really\r\nno end; so the Mole drew his arm through Toad\xe2\x80\x99s, led him out into the\r\nopen air, shoved him into a wicker chair, and made him tell him all his\r\nadventures from beginning to end, which Toad was only too willing to\r\ndo. The Mole was a good listener, and Toad, with no one to check his\r\nstatements or to criticise in an unfriendly spirit, rather let himself\r\ngo. Indeed, much that he related belonged more properly to the category\r\nof what-might-have-happened-had-I-only-thought-of-it-in-time-instead-of\r\nten-minutes-afterwards. Those are always the best and the raciest\r\nadventures; and why should they not be truly ours, as much as the\r\nsomewhat inadequate things that really come off?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nTHE RETURN OF ULYSSES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it began to grow dark, the Rat, with an air of excitement and\r\nmystery, summoned them back into the parlour, stood each of them up\r\nalongside of his little heap, and proceeded to dress them up for the\r\ncoming expedition. He was very earnest and thoroughgoing about it, and\r\nthe affair took quite a long time. First, there was a belt to go round\r\neach animal, and then a sword to be stuck into each belt, and then a\r\ncutlass on the other side to balance it. Then a pair of pistols, a\r\npoliceman\xe2\x80\x99s truncheon, several sets of handcuffs, some bandages and\r\nsticking-plaster, and a flask and a sandwich-case. The Badger laughed\r\ngood-humouredly and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Ratty! It amuses you and it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do with this here\r\nstick.\xe2\x80\x9d But the Rat only said, \xe2\x80\x9c_please_, Badger. You know I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike you to blame me afterwards and say I had forgotten _anything!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen all was quite ready, the Badger took a dark lantern in one paw,\r\ngrasped his great stick with the other, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, follow me!\r\nMole first, \xe2\x80\x9ccos I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased with him; Rat next; Toad last. And\r\nlook here, Toady! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you chatter so much as usual, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sent\r\nback, as sure as fate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Toad was so anxious not to be left out that he took up the inferior\r\nposition assigned to him without a murmur, and the animals set off. The\r\nBadger led them along by the river for a little way, and then suddenly\r\nswung himself over the edge into a hole in the river-bank, a little\r\nabove the water. The Mole and the Rat followed silently, swinging\r\nthemselves successfully into the hole as they had seen the Badger do;\r\nbut when it came to Toad\xe2\x80\x99s turn, of course he managed to slip and fall\r\ninto the water with a loud splash and a squeal of alarm. He was hauled\r\nout by his friends, rubbed down and wrung out hastily, comforted, and\r\nset on his legs; but the Badger was seriously angry, and told him that\r\nthe very next time he made a fool of himself he would most certainly be\r\nleft behind.\r\n\r\nSo at last they were in the secret passage, and the cutting-out\r\nexpedition had really begun!\r\n\r\nIt was cold, and dark, and damp, and low, and narrow, and poor Toad\r\nbegan to shiver, partly from dread of what might be before him, partly\r\nbecause he was wet through. The lantern was far ahead, and he could not\r\nhelp lagging behind a little in the darkness. Then he heard the Rat\r\ncall out warningly, \xe2\x80\x9c_Come_ on, Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d and a terror seized him of being\r\nleft behind, alone in the darkness, and he \xe2\x80\x9ccame on\xe2\x80\x9d with such a rush\r\nthat he upset the Rat into the Mole and the Mole into the Badger, and\r\nfor a moment all was confusion. The Badger thought they were being\r\nattacked from behind, and, as there was no room to use a stick or a\r\ncutlass, drew a pistol, and was on the point of putting a bullet into\r\nToad. When he found out what had really happened he was very angry\r\nindeed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow this time that tiresome Toad _shall_ be left\r\nbehind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Toad whimpered, and the other two promised that they would be\r\nanswerable for his good conduct, and at last the Badger was pacified,\r\nand the procession moved on; only this time the Rat brought up the\r\nrear, with a firm grip on the shoulder of Toad.\r\n\r\nSo they groped and shuffled along, with their ears pricked up and their\r\npaws on their pistols, till at last the Badger said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought by now\r\nto be pretty nearly under the Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly they heard, far away as it might be, and yet apparently\r\nnearly over their heads, a confused murmur of sound, as if people were\r\nshouting and cheering and stamping on the floor and hammering on\r\ntables. The Toad\xe2\x80\x99s nervous terrors all returned, but the Badger only\r\nremarked placidly, \xe2\x80\x9cThey _are_ going it, the Weasels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe passage now began to slope upwards; they groped onward a little\r\nfurther, and then the noise broke out again, quite distinct this time,\r\nand very close above them. \xe2\x80\x9cOoo-ray-ooray-oo-ray-ooray!\xe2\x80\x9d they heard,\r\nand the stamping of little feet on the floor, and the clinking of\r\nglasses as little fists pounded on the table. \xe2\x80\x9c_What_ a time they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhaving!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d They hurried along the passage\r\ntill it came to a full stop, and they found themselves standing under\r\nthe trap-door that led up into the butler\xe2\x80\x99s pantry.\r\n\r\nSuch a tremendous noise was going on in the banqueting-hall that there\r\nwas little danger of their being overheard. The Badger said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nboys, all together!\xe2\x80\x9d and the four of them put their shoulders to the\r\ntrap-door and heaved it back. Hoisting each other up, they found\r\nthemselves standing in the pantry, with only a door between them and\r\nthe banqueting-hall, where their unconscious enemies were carousing.\r\n\r\nThe noise, as they emerged from the passage, was simply deafening. At\r\nlast, as the cheering and hammering slowly subsided, a voice could be\r\nmade out saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I do not propose to detain you much\r\nlonger\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(great applause)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut before I resume my seat\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(renewed\r\ncheering)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to say one word about our kind host, Mr. Toad.\r\nWe all know Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(great laughter)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Good_ Toad, _modest_ Toad,\r\n_honest_ Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d (shrieks of merriment).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly just let me get at him!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Toad, grinding his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold hard a minute!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, restraining him with difficulty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet ready, all of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Let me sing you a little song,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I have\r\ncomposed on the subject of Toad\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(prolonged applause).\r\n\r\nThen the Chief Weasel\xe2\x80\x94for it was he\xe2\x80\x94began in a high, squeaky voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToad he went a-pleasuring\r\nGaily down the street\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Badger drew himself up, took a firm grip of his stick with both\r\npaws, glanced round at his comrades, and cried\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hour is come! Follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd flung the door open wide.\r\n\r\nMy!\r\n\r\nWhat a squealing and a squeaking and a screeching filled the air!\r\n\r\nWell might the terrified weasels dive under the tables and spring madly\r\nup at the windows! Well might the ferrets rush wildly for the fireplace\r\nand get hopelessly jammed in the chimney! Well might tables and chairs\r\nbe upset, and glass and china be sent crashing on the floor, in the\r\npanic of that terrible moment when the four Heroes strode wrathfully\r\ninto the room! The mighty Badger, his whiskers bristling, his great\r\ncudgel whistling through the air; Mole, black and grim, brandishing his\r\nstick and shouting his awful war-cry, \xe2\x80\x9cA Mole! A Mole!\xe2\x80\x9d Rat; desperate\r\nand determined, his belt bulging with weapons of every age and every\r\nvariety; Toad, frenzied with excitement and injured pride, swollen to\r\ntwice his ordinary size, leaping into the air and emitting Toad-whoops\r\nthat chilled them to the marrow! \xe2\x80\x9cToad he went a-pleasuring!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nyelled. \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ pleasure \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d and he went straight for the Chief\r\nWeasel. They were but four in all, but to the panic-stricken weasels\r\nthe hall seemed full of monstrous animals, grey, black, brown and\r\nyellow, whooping and flourishing enormous cudgels; and they broke and\r\nfled with squeals of terror and dismay, this way and that, through the\r\nwindows, up the chimney, anywhere to get out of reach of those terrible\r\nsticks.\r\n\r\nThe affair was soon over. Up and down, the whole length of the hall,\r\nstrode the four Friends, whacking with their sticks at every head that\r\nshowed itself; and in five minutes the room was cleared. Through the\r\nbroken windows the shrieks of terrified weasels escaping across the\r\nlawn were borne faintly to their ears; on the floor lay prostrate some\r\ndozen or so of the enemy, on whom the Mole was busily engaged in\r\nfitting handcuffs. The Badger, resting from his labours, leant on his\r\nstick and wiped his honest brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMole,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re the best of fellows! Just cut along outside\r\nand look after those stoat-sentries of yours, and see what they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndoing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve an idea that, thanks to you, we shan\xe2\x80\x99t have much trouble\r\nfrom _them_ to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mole vanished promptly through a window; and the Badger bade the\r\nother two set a table on its legs again, pick up knives and forks and\r\nplates and glasses from the _d\xc3\xa9bris_ on the floor, and see if they\r\ncould find materials for a supper. \xe2\x80\x9cI want some grub, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nin that rather common way he had of speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cStir your stumps, Toad,\r\nand look lively! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got your house back for you, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t offer\r\nus so much as a sandwich.\xe2\x80\x9d Toad felt rather hurt that the Badger didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay pleasant things to him, as he had to the Mole, and tell him what a\r\nfine fellow he was, and how splendidly he had fought; for he was rather\r\nparticularly pleased with himself and the way he had gone for the Chief\r\nWeasel and sent him flying across the table with one blow of his stick.\r\nBut he bustled about, and so did the Rat, and soon they found some\r\nguava jelly in a glass dish, and a cold chicken, a tongue that had\r\nhardly been touched, some trifle, and quite a lot of lobster salad; and\r\nin the pantry they came upon a basketful of French rolls and any\r\nquantity of cheese, butter, and celery. They were just about to sit\r\ndown when the Mole clambered in through the window, chuckling, with an\r\narmful of rifles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over,\xe2\x80\x9d he reported. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I can make out, as soon as the\r\nstoats, who were very nervous and jumpy already, heard the shrieks and\r\nthe yells and the uproar inside the hall, some of them threw down their\r\nrifles and fled. The others stood fast for a bit, but when the weasels\r\ncame rushing out upon them they thought they were betrayed; and the\r\nstoats grappled with the weasels, and the weasels fought to get away,\r\nand they wrestled and wriggled and punched each other, and rolled over\r\nand over, till most of \xe2\x80\x99em rolled into the river! They\xe2\x80\x99ve all\r\ndisappeared by now, one way or another; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got their rifles. So\r\n_that\xe2\x80\x99s_ all right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent and deserving animal!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger, his mouth full of\r\nchicken and trifle. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, there\xe2\x80\x99s just one more thing I want you to do,\r\nMole, before you sit down to your supper along of us; and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrouble you only I know I can trust you to see a thing done, and I wish\r\nI could say the same of every one I know. I\xe2\x80\x99d send Rat, if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\npoet. I want you to take those fellows on the floor there upstairs with\r\nyou, and have some bedrooms cleaned out and tidied up and made really\r\ncomfortable. See that they sweep _under_ the beds, and put clean sheets\r\nand pillow-cases on, and turn down one corner of the bed-clothes, just\r\nas you know it ought to be done; and have a can of hot water, and clean\r\ntowels, and fresh cakes of soap, put in each room. And then you can\r\ngive them a licking a-piece, if it\xe2\x80\x99s any satisfaction to you, and put\r\nthem out by the back-door, and we shan\xe2\x80\x99t see any more of _them_, I\r\nfancy. And then come along and have some of this cold tongue. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst rate. I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased with you, Mole!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goodnatured Mole picked up a stick, formed his prisoners up in a\r\nline on the floor, gave them the order \xe2\x80\x9cQuick march!\xe2\x80\x9d and led his squad\r\noff to the upper floor. After a time, he appeared again, smiling, and\r\nsaid that every room was ready, and as clean as a new pin. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have to lick them, either,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, on the whole,\r\nthey had had licking enough for one night, and the weasels, when I put\r\nthe point to them, quite agreed with me, and said they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nof troubling me. They were very penitent, and said they were extremely\r\nsorry for what they had done, but it was all the fault of the Chief\r\nWeasel and the stoats, and if ever they could do anything for us at any\r\ntime to make up, we had only got to mention it. So I gave them a roll\r\na-piece, and let them out at the back, and off they ran, as hard as\r\nthey could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the Mole pulled his chair up to the table, and pitched into the\r\ncold tongue; and Toad, like the gentleman he was, put all his jealousy\r\nfrom him, and said heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you kindly, dear Mole, for all your\r\npains and trouble tonight, and especially for your cleverness this\r\nmorning!\xe2\x80\x9d The Badger was pleased at that, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere spoke my\r\nbrave Toad!\xe2\x80\x9d So they finished their supper in great joy and\r\ncontentment, and presently retired to rest between clean sheets, safe\r\nin Toad\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral home, won back by matchless valour, consummate\r\nstrategy, and a proper handling of sticks.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Toad, who had overslept himself as usual, came\r\ndown to breakfast disgracefully late, and found on the table a certain\r\nquantity of egg-shells, some fragments of cold and leathery toast, a\r\ncoffee-pot three-fourths empty, and really very little else; which did\r\nnot tend to improve his temper, considering that, after all, it was his\r\nown house. Through the French windows of the breakfast-room he could\r\nsee the Mole and the Water Rat sitting in wicker-chairs out on the\r\nlawn, evidently telling each other stories; roaring with laughter and\r\nkicking their short legs up in the air. The Badger, who was in an\r\narm-chair and deep in the morning paper, merely looked up and nodded\r\nwhen Toad entered the room. But Toad knew his man, so he sat down and\r\nmade the best breakfast he could, merely observing to himself that he\r\nwould get square with the others sooner or later. When he had nearly\r\nfinished, the Badger looked up and remarked rather shortly: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\r\nToad, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid there\xe2\x80\x99s a heavy morning\xe2\x80\x99s work in front of you.\r\nYou see, we really ought to have a Banquet at once, to celebrate this\r\naffair. It\xe2\x80\x99s expected of you\xe2\x80\x94in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s the rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Toad, readily. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything to oblige. Though why\r\non earth you should want to have a Banquet in the morning I cannot\r\nunderstand. But you know I do not live to please myself, but merely to\r\nfind out what my friends want, and then try and arrange it for \xe2\x80\x99em, you\r\ndear old Badger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be stupider than you really are,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Badger,\r\ncrossly; \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t chuckle and splutter in your coffee while you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntalking; it\xe2\x80\x99s not manners. What I mean is, the Banquet will be at\r\nnight, of course, but the invitations will have to be written and got\r\noff at once, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to write \xe2\x80\x99em. Now, sit down at that\r\ntable\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s stacks of letter-paper on it, with \xe2\x80\x98Toad Hall\xe2\x80\x99 at the top\r\nin blue and gold\xe2\x80\x94and write invitations to all our friends, and if you\r\nstick to it we shall get them out before luncheon. And _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ bear a\r\nhand, too; and take my share of the burden. _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ order the Banquet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toad, dismayed. \xe2\x80\x9cMe stop indoors and write a lot of\r\nrotten letters on a jolly morning like this, when I want to go around\r\nmy property, and set everything and everybody to rights, and swagger\r\nabout and enjoy myself! Certainly not! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Stop a\r\nminute, though! Why, of course, dear Badger! What is my pleasure or\r\nconvenience compared with that of others! You wish it done, and it\r\nshall be done. Go, Badger, order the Banquet, order what you like; then\r\njoin our young friends outside in their innocent mirth, oblivious of me\r\nand my cares and toils. I sacrifice this fair morning on the altar of\r\nduty and friendship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Badger looked at him very suspiciously, but Toad\xe2\x80\x99s frank, open\r\ncountenance made it difficult to suggest any unworthy motive in this\r\nchange of attitude. He quitted the room, accordingly, in the direction\r\nof the kitchen, and as soon as the door had closed behind him, Toad\r\nhurried to the writing-table. A fine idea had occurred to him while he\r\nwas talking. He _would_ write the invitations; and he would take care\r\nto mention the leading part he had taken in the fight, and how he had\r\nlaid the Chief Weasel flat; and he would hint at his adventures, and\r\nwhat a career of triumph he had to tell about; and on the fly-leaf he\r\nwould set out a sort of a programme of entertainment for the\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x94something like this, as he sketched it out in his head:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSPEECH. . . . BY TOAD.\r\n(There will be other speeches by TOAD during the evening.)\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS. . . BY TOAD\r\nSYNOPSIS\xe2\x80\x94Our Prison System\xe2\x80\x94the Waterways of Old England\xe2\x80\x94Horse-dealing,\r\nand how to deal\xe2\x80\x94Property, its rights and its duties\xe2\x80\x94Back to the Land\xe2\x80\x94A\r\nTypical English Squire.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG. . . . BY TOAD.\r\n(Composed by himself.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER COMPOSITIONS. BY TOAD\r\nwill be sung in the course of the evening by the. . . COMPOSER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea pleased him mightily, and he worked very hard and got all the\r\nletters finished by noon, at which hour it was reported to him that\r\nthere was a small and rather bedraggled weasel at the door, inquiring\r\ntimidly whether he could be of any service to the gentlemen. Toad\r\nswaggered out and found it was one of the prisoners of the previous\r\nevening, very respectful and anxious to please. He patted him on the\r\nhead, shoved the bundle of invitations into his paw, and told him to\r\ncut along quick and deliver them as fast as he could, and if he liked\r\nto come back again in the evening, perhaps there might be a shilling\r\nfor him, or, again, perhaps there mightn\xe2\x80\x99t; and the poor weasel seemed\r\nreally quite grateful, and hurried off eagerly to do his mission.\r\n\r\nWhen the other animals came back to luncheon, very boisterous and\r\nbreezy after a morning on the river, the Mole, whose conscience had\r\nbeen pricking him, looked doubtfully at Toad, expecting to find him\r\nsulky or depressed. Instead, he was so uppish and inflated that the\r\nMole began to suspect something; while the Rat and the Badger exchanged\r\nsignificant glances.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the meal was over, Toad thrust his paws deep into his\r\ntrouser-pockets, remarked casually, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, look after yourselves, you\r\nfellows! Ask for anything you want!\xe2\x80\x9d and was swaggering off in the\r\ndirection of the garden, where he wanted to think out an idea or two\r\nfor his coming speeches, when the Rat caught him by the arm.\r\n\r\nToad rather suspected what he was after, and did his best to get away;\r\nbut when the Badger took him firmly by the other arm he began to see\r\nthat the game was up. The two animals conducted him between them into\r\nthe small smoking-room that opened out of the entrance-hall, shut the\r\ndoor, and put him into a chair. Then they both stood in front of him,\r\nwhile Toad sat silent and regarded them with much suspicion and\r\nill-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look here, Toad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about this Banquet, and\r\nvery sorry I am to have to speak to you like this. But we want you to\r\nunderstand clearly, once and for all, that there are going to be no\r\nspeeches and no songs. Try and grasp the fact that on this occasion\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re not arguing with you; we\xe2\x80\x99re just telling you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad saw that he was trapped. They understood him, they saw through\r\nhim, they had got ahead of him. His pleasant dream was shattered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayn\xe2\x80\x99t I sing them just one _little_ song?\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded piteously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not _one_ little song,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rat firmly, though his heart\r\nbled as he noticed the trembling lip of the poor disappointed Toad.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good, Toady; you know well that your songs are all conceit and\r\nboasting and vanity; and your speeches are all self-praise\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94well, and gross exaggeration and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd gas,\xe2\x80\x9d put in the Badger, in his common way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for your own good, Toady,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you _must_\r\nturn over a new leaf sooner or later, and now seems a splendid time to\r\nbegin; a sort of turning-point in your career. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\r\nsaying all this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me more than it hurts you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToad remained a long while plunged in thought. At last he raised his\r\nhead, and the traces of strong emotion were visible on his features.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have conquered, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in broken accents. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was,\r\nto be sure, but a small thing that I asked\xe2\x80\x94merely leave to blossom and\r\nexpand for yet one more evening, to let myself go and hear the\r\ntumultuous applause that always seems to me\xe2\x80\x94somehow\xe2\x80\x94to bring out my\r\nbest qualities. However, you are right, I know, and I am wrong. Hence\r\nforth I will be a very different Toad. My friends, you shall never have\r\noccasion to blush for me again. But, O dear, O dear, this is a hard\r\nworld!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, pressing his handkerchief to his face, he left the room, with\r\nfaltering footsteps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBadger,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ feel like a brute; I wonder what _you_\r\nfeel like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I know, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Badger gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the thing had to be\r\ndone. This good fellow has got to live here, and hold his own, and be\r\nrespected. Would you have him a common laughing-stock, mocked and\r\njeered at by stoats and weasels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, talking of weasels, it\xe2\x80\x99s lucky we\r\ncame upon that little weasel, just as he was setting out with Toad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvitations. I suspected something from what you told me, and had a\r\nlook at one or two; they were simply disgraceful. I confiscated the\r\nlot, and the good Mole is now sitting in the blue boudoir, filling up\r\nplain, simple invitation cards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the hour for the banquet began to draw near, and Toad, who on\r\nleaving the others had retired to his bedroom, was still sitting there,\r\nmelancholy and thoughtful. His brow resting on his paw, he pondered\r\nlong and deeply. Gradually his countenance cleared, and he began to\r\nsmile long, slow smiles. Then he took to giggling in a shy,\r\nself-conscious manner. At last he got up, locked the door, drew the\r\ncurtains across the windows, collected all the chairs in the room and\r\narranged them in a semicircle, and took up his position in front of\r\nthem, swelling visibly. Then he bowed, coughed twice, and, letting\r\nhimself go, with uplifted voice he sang, to the enraptured audience\r\nthat his imagination so clearly saw.\r\n\r\nTOAD\xe2\x80\x99S LAST LITTLE SONG!\r\n\r\nThe Toad\xe2\x80\x94came\xe2\x80\x94home!\r\nThere was panic in the parlours and howling in the halls,\r\nThere was crying in the cow-sheds and shrieking in the stalls,\r\nWhen the Toad\xe2\x80\x94came\xe2\x80\x94home!\r\n\r\nWhen the Toad\xe2\x80\x94came\xe2\x80\x94home!\r\nThere was smashing in of window and crashing in of door,\r\nThere was chivvying of weasels that fainted on the floor,\r\nWhen the Toad\xe2\x80\x94came\xe2\x80\x94home!\r\n\r\nBang! go the drums!\r\nThe trumpeters are tooting and the soldiers are saluting,\r\nAnd the cannon they are shooting and the motor-cars are hooting,\r\nAs the\xe2\x80\x94Hero\xe2\x80\x94comes!\r\n\r\nShout\xe2\x80\x94Hoo-ray!\r\nAnd let each one of the crowd try and shout it very loud,\r\nIn honour of an animal of whom you\xe2\x80\x99re justly proud,\r\nFor it\xe2\x80\x99s Toad\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94great\xe2\x80\x94day!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sang this very loud, with great unction and expression; and when he\r\nhad done, he sang it all over again.\r\n\r\nThen he heaved a deep sigh; a long, long, long sigh.\r\n\r\nThen he dipped his hairbrush in the water-jug, parted his hair in the\r\nmiddle, and plastered it down very straight and sleek on each side of\r\nhis face; and, unlocking the door, went quietly down the stairs to\r\ngreet his guests, who he knew must be assembling in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nAll the animals cheered when he entered, and crowded round to\r\ncongratulate him and say nice things about his courage, and his\r\ncleverness, and his fighting qualities; but Toad only smiled faintly,\r\nand murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all!\xe2\x80\x9d Or, sometimes, for a change, \xe2\x80\x9cOn the\r\ncontrary!\xe2\x80\x9d Otter, who was standing on the hearthrug, describing to an\r\nadmiring circle of friends exactly how he would have managed things had\r\nhe been there, came forward with a shout, threw his arm round Toad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck, and tried to take him round the room in triumphal progress; but\r\nToad, in a mild way, was rather snubby to him, remarking gently, as he\r\ndisengaged himself, \xe2\x80\x9cBadger\xe2\x80\x99s was the mastermind; the Mole and the\r\nWater Rat bore the brunt of the fighting; I merely served in the ranks\r\nand did little or nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d The animals were evidently puzzled and\r\ntaken aback by this unexpected attitude of his; and Toad felt, as he\r\nmoved from one guest to the other, making his modest responses, that he\r\nwas an object of absorbing interest to every one.\r\n\r\nThe Badger had ordered everything of the best, and the banquet was a\r\ngreat success. There was much talking and laughter and chaff among the\r\nanimals, but through it all Toad, who of course was in the chair,\r\nlooked down his nose and murmured pleasant nothings to the animals on\r\neither side of him. At intervals he stole a glance at the Badger and\r\nthe Rat, and always when he looked they were staring at each other with\r\ntheir mouths open; and this gave him the greatest satisfaction. Some of\r\nthe younger and livelier animals, as the evening wore on, got\r\nwhispering to each other that things were not so amusing as they used\r\nto be in the good old days; and there were some knockings on the table\r\nand cries of \xe2\x80\x9cToad! Speech! Speech from Toad! Song! Mr. Toad\xe2\x80\x99s song!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut Toad only shook his head gently, raised one paw in mild protest,\r\nand, by pressing delicacies on his guests, by topical small-talk, and\r\nby earnest inquiries after members of their families not yet old enough\r\nto appear at social functions, managed to convey to them that this\r\ndinner was being run on strictly conventional lines.\r\n\r\nHe was indeed an altered Toad!\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this climax, the four animals continued to lead their lives, so\r\nrudely broken in upon by civil war, in great joy and contentment,\r\nundisturbed by further risings or invasions. Toad, after due\r\nconsultation with his friends, selected a handsome gold chain and\r\nlocket set with pearls, which he dispatched to the gaoler\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\nwith a letter that even the Badger admitted to be modest, grateful, and\r\nappreciative; and the engine-driver, in his turn, was properly thanked\r\nand compensated for all his pains and trouble. Under severe compulsion\r\nfrom the Badger, even the barge-woman was, with some trouble, sought\r\nout and the value of her horse discreetly made good to her; though Toad\r\nkicked terribly at this, holding himself to be an instrument of Fate,\r\nsent to punish fat women with mottled arms who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell a real\r\ngentleman when they saw one. The amount involved, it was true, was not\r\nvery burdensome, the gipsy\xe2\x80\x99s valuation being admitted by local\r\nassessors to be approximately correct.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the course of long summer evenings, the friends would\r\ntake a stroll together in the Wild Wood, now successfully tamed so far\r\nas they were concerned; and it was pleasing to see how respectfully\r\nthey were greeted by the inhabitants, and how the mother-weasels would\r\nbring their young ones to the mouths of their holes, and say, pointing,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, baby! There goes the great Mr. Toad! And that\xe2\x80\x99s the gallant\r\nWater Rat, a terrible fighter, walking along o\xe2\x80\x99 him! And yonder comes\r\nthe famous Mr. Mole, of whom you so often have heard your father tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut when their infants were fractious and quite beyond control, they\r\nwould quiet them by telling how, if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hush them and not fret\r\nthem, the terrible grey Badger would up and get them. This was a base\r\nlibel on Badger, who, though he cared little about Society, was rather\r\nfond of children; but it never failed to have its full effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 289-0.txt or 289-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/289/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
