Celebrations and\r\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\r\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\r\nof Mary Antrim\xe2\x80\x99s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\r\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\r\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\r\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\r\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\r\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\r\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\r\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\r\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\r\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\r\n\r\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\r\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\r\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\r\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\r\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\r\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\r\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\r\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\r\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\r\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\r\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\r\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\r\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s breast, but which he had seen lose one\r\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\r\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\r\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\r\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\r\nimmense escape from the actual.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s true that if there weren\xe2\x80\x99t other dates than this there were other\r\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\r\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\r\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\r\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen death more closely,\r\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\r\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\r\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\r\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\r\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\r\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\r\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\r\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\r\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\r\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\r\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\r\nothers.  So on George Stransom\xe2\x80\x99s part had grown up with the years a\r\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\r\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\r\nthe soul.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\r\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\r\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\r\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\r\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\r\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\r\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\r\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\r\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t at all events the\r\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\r\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\r\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\r\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\r\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\r\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\r\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\r\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\r\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\r\ncould build such temples of the spirit\xe2\x80\x94could make them blaze with candles\r\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\r\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\r\ngenerous heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\r\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\r\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\r\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\r\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\r\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\r\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cworth\xe2\x80\x9d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\r\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\r\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\r\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\r\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\r\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\r\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\r\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\r\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\r\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s arm.  It lasted\r\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\r\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\xe2\x80\x94the ambiguity met him there in\r\nthe short drop of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\r\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\r\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\r\nexclaimed\xe2\x80\x94behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\r\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\r\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\r\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\r\nThat son of affliction wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\r\nhis companion\xe2\x80\x99s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\r\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\r\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\r\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\r\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\r\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\r\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\r\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\r\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\r\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\r\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\r\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s window, and in the happy candour\r\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\r\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\xe2\x80\x99s wife thus attributed to her\r\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\r\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\r\nand Stransom hadn\xe2\x80\x99t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\r\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\r\nheard of poor Creston\xe2\x80\x99s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\r\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\r\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\r\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\r\nhe would, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\r\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\r\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\r\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\r\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\r\nthe fog, \xe2\x80\x9cMind now you come to see me right away!\xe2\x80\x9d  Creston had had the\r\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\r\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\r\n\r\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\r\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have shown\r\nher without precautions, oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\r\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\r\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\r\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\r\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\r\nGeorge Stransom\xe2\x80\x99s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\xe2\x80\x94there were\r\nparticular hours he always passed alone\xe2\x80\x94the harshness dropped from it and\r\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\r\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.  He had known her\r\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\r\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\r\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\r\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\r\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\r\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\r\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\r\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\r\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\r\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\r\ngiven it up\xe2\x80\x94dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\r\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\r\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\r\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fill; and he had\r\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\r\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\r\nbook in his lap, but he had no eyes for his page: his eyes, in the\r\nswarming void of things, seemed to have caught Kate Creston\xe2\x80\x99s, and it was\r\ninto their sad silences he looked.  It was to him her sentient spirit had\r\nturned, knowing it to be of her he would think.  He thought for a long\r\ntime of how the closed eyes of dead women could still live\xe2\x80\x94how they could\r\nopen again, in a quiet lamplit room, long after they had looked their\r\nlast.  They had looks that survived\xe2\x80\x94had them as great poets had quoted\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper lay by his chair\xe2\x80\x94the thing that came in the afternoon and\r\nthe servants thought one wanted; without sense for what was in it he had\r\nmechanically unfolded and then dropped it.  Before he went to bed he took\r\nit up, and this time, at the top of a paragraph, he was caught by five\r\nwords that made him start.  He stood staring, before the fire, at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath of Sir Acton Hague, K.C.B.,\xe2\x80\x9d the man who ten years earlier had\r\nbeen the nearest of his friends and whose deposition from this eminence\r\nhad practically left it without an occupant.  He had seen him after their\r\nrupture, but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t now seen him for years.  Standing there before the\r\nfire he turned cold as he read what had befallen him.  Promoted a short\r\ntime previous to the governorship of the Westward Islands, Acton Hague\r\nhad died, in the bleak honour of this exile, of an illness consequent on\r\nthe bite of a poisonous snake.  His career was compressed by the\r\nnewspaper into a dozen lines, the perusal of which excited on George\r\nStransom\xe2\x80\x99s part no warmer feeling than one of relief at the absence of\r\nany mention of their quarrel, an incident accidentally tainted at the\r\ntime, thanks to their joint immersion in large affairs, with a horrible\r\npublicity.  Public indeed was the wrong Stransom had, to his own sense,\r\nsuffered, the insult he had blankly taken from the only man with whom he\r\nhad ever been intimate; the friend, almost adored, of his University\r\nyears, the subject, later, of his passionate loyalty: so public that he\r\nhad never spoken of it to a human creature, so public that he had\r\ncompletely overlooked it.  It had made the difference for him that\r\nfriendship too was all over, but it had only made just that one.  The\r\nshock of interests had been private, intensely so; but the action taken\r\nby Hague had been in the face of men.  To-day it all seemed to have\r\noccurred merely to the end that George Stransom should think of him as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHague\xe2\x80\x9d and measure exactly how much he himself could resemble a stone.\r\nHe went cold, suddenly and horribly cold, to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, in the afternoon, in the great grey suburb, he knew his\r\nlong walk had tired him.  In the dreadful cemetery alone he had been on\r\nhis feet an hour.  Instinctively, coming back, they had taken him a\r\ndevious course, and it was a desert in which no circling cabman hovered\r\nover possible prey.  He paused on a corner and measured the dreariness;\r\nthen he made out through the gathered dusk that he was in one of those\r\ntracts of London which are less gloomy by night than by day, because, in\r\nthe former case of the civil gift of light.  By day there was nothing,\r\nbut by night there were lamps, and George Stransom was in a mood that\r\nmade lamps good in themselves.  It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that they could show him\r\nanything, it was only that they could burn clear.  To his surprise,\r\nhowever, after a while, they did show him something: the arch of a high\r\ndoorway approached by a low terrace of steps, in the depth of which\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nformed a dim vestibule\xe2\x80\x94the raising of a curtain at the moment he passed\r\ngave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of tapers at the\r\nend.  He stopped and looked up, recognising the place as a church.  The\r\nthought quickly came to him that since he was tired he might rest there;\r\nso that after a moment he had in turn pushed up the leathern curtain and\r\ngone in.  It was a temple of the old persuasion, and there had evidently\r\nbeen a function\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a service for the dead; the high altar was still\r\na blaze of candles.  This was an exhibition he always liked, and he\r\ndropped into a seat with relief.  More than it had ever yet come home to\r\nhim it struck him as good there should be churches.\r\n\r\nThis one was almost empty and the other altars were dim; a verger\r\nshuffled about, an old woman coughed, but it seemed to Stransom there was\r\nhospitality in the thick sweet air.  Was it only the savour of the\r\nincense or was it something of larger intention?  He had at any rate\r\nquitted the great grey suburb and come nearer to the warm centre.  He\r\npresently ceased to feel intrusive, gaining at last even a sense of\r\ncommunity with the only worshipper in his neighbourhood, the sombre\r\npresence of a woman, in mourning unrelieved, whose back was all he could\r\nsee of her and who had sunk deep into prayer at no great distance from\r\nhim.  He wished he could sink, like her, to the very bottom, be as\r\nmotionless, as rapt in prostration.  After a few moments he shifted his\r\nseat; it was almost indelicate to be so aware of her.  But Stransom\r\nsubsequently quite lost himself, floating away on the sea of light.  If\r\noccasions like this had been more frequent in his life he would have had\r\nmore present the great original type, set up in a myriad temples, of the\r\nunapproachable shrine he had erected in his mind.  That shrine had begun\r\nin vague likeness to church pomps, but the echo had ended by growing more\r\ndistinct than the sound.  The sound now rang out, the type blazed at him\r\nwith all its fires and with a mystery of radiance in which endless\r\nmeanings could glow.  The thing became as he sat there his appropriate\r\naltar and each starry candle an appropriate vow.  He numbered them, named\r\nthem, grouped them\xe2\x80\x94it was the silent roll-call of his Dead.  They made\r\ntogether a brightness vast and intense, a brightness in which the mere\r\nchapel of his thoughts grew so dim that as it faded away he asked himself\r\nif he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find his real comfort in some material act, some outward\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nThis idea took possession of him while, at a distance, the black-robed\r\nlady continued prostrate; he was quietly thrilled with his conception,\r\nwhich at last brought him to his feet in the sudden excitement of a plan.\r\nHe wandered softly through the aisles, pausing in the different chapels,\r\nall save one applied to a special devotion.  It was in this clear recess,\r\nlampless and unapplied, that he stood longest\xe2\x80\x94the length of time it took\r\nhim fully to grasp the conception of gilding it with his bounty.  He\r\nshould snatch it from no other rites and associate it with nothing\r\nprofane; he would simply take it as it should be given up to him and make\r\nit a masterpiece of splendour and a mountain of fire.  Tended sacredly\r\nall the year, with the sanctifying church round it, it would always be\r\nready for his offices.  There would be difficulties, but from the first\r\nthey presented themselves only as difficulties surmounted.  Even for a\r\nperson so little affiliated the thing would be a matter of arrangement.\r\nHe saw it all in advance, and how bright in especial the place would\r\nbecome to him in the intermissions of toil and the dusk of afternoons;\r\nhow rich in assurance at all times, but especially in the indifferent\r\nworld.  Before withdrawing he drew nearer again to the spot where he had\r\nfirst sat down, and in the movement he met the lady whom he had seen\r\npraying and who was now on her way to the door.  She passed him quickly,\r\nand he had only a glimpse of her pale face and her unconscious, almost\r\nsightless eyes.  For that instant she looked faded and handsome.\r\n\r\nThis was the origin of the rites more public, yet certainly esoteric,\r\nthat he at last found himself able to establish.  It took a long time, it\r\ntook a year, and both the process and the result would have been\xe2\x80\x94for any\r\nwho knew\xe2\x80\x94a vivid picture of his good faith.  No one did know, in fact\xe2\x80\x94no\r\none but the bland ecclesiastics whose acquaintance he had promptly\r\nsought, whose objections he had softly overridden, whose curiosity and\r\nsympathy he had artfully charmed, whose assent to his eccentric\r\nmunificence he had eventually won, and who had asked for concessions in\r\nexchange for indulgences.  Stransom had of course at an early stage of\r\nhis enquiry been referred to the Bishop, and the Bishop had been\r\ndelightfully human, the Bishop had been almost amused.  Success was\r\nwithin sight, at any rate from the moment the attitude of those whom it\r\nconcerned became liberal in response to liberality.  The altar and the\r\nsacred shell that half encircled it, consecrated to an ostensible and\r\ncustomary worship, were to be splendidly maintained; all that Stransom\r\nreserved to himself was the number of his lights and the free enjoyment\r\nof his intention.  When the intention had taken complete effect the\r\nenjoyment became even greater than he had ventured to hope.  He liked to\r\nthink of this effect when far from it, liked to convince himself of it\r\nyet again when near.  He was not often indeed so near as that a visit to\r\nit hadn\xe2\x80\x99t perforce something of the patience of a pilgrimage; but the\r\ntime he gave to his devotion came to seem to him more a contribution to\r\nhis other interests than a betrayal of them.  Even a loaded life might be\r\neasier when one had added a new necessity to it.\r\n\r\nHow much easier was probably never guessed by those who simply knew there\r\nwere hours when he disappeared and for many of whom there was a vulgar\r\nreading of what they used to call his plunges.  These plunges were into\r\ndepths quieter than the deep sea-caves, and the habit had at the end of a\r\nyear or two become the one it would have cost him most to relinquish.\r\nNow they had really, his Dead, something that was indefensibly theirs;\r\nand he liked to think that they might in cases be the Dead of others, as\r\nwell as that the Dead of others might be invoked there under the\r\nprotection of what he had done.  Whoever bent a knee on the carpet he had\r\nlaid down appeared to him to act in the spirit of his intention.  Each of\r\nhis lights had a name for him, and from time to time a new light was\r\nkindled.  This was what he had fundamentally agreed for, that there\r\nshould always be room for them all.  What those who passed or lingered\r\nsaw was simply the most resplendent of the altars called suddenly into\r\nvivid usefulness, with a quiet elderly man, for whom it evidently had a\r\nfascination, often seated there in a maze or a doze; but half the\r\nsatisfaction of the spot for this mysterious and fitful worshipper was\r\nthat he found the years of his life there, and the ties, the affections,\r\nthe struggles, the submissions, the conquests, if there had been such, a\r\nrecord of that adventurous journey in which the beginnings and the\r\nendings of human relations are the lettered mile-stones.  He had in\r\ngeneral little taste for the past as a part of his own history; at other\r\ntimes and in other places it mostly seemed to him pitiful to consider and\r\nimpossible to repair; but on these occasions he accepted it with\r\nsomething of that positive gladness with which one adjusts one\xe2\x80\x99s self to\r\nan ache that begins to succumb to treatment.  To the treatment of time\r\nthe malady of life begins at a given moment to succumb; and these were\r\ndoubtless the hours at which that truth most came home to him.  The day\r\nwas written for him there on which he had first become acquainted with\r\ndeath, and the successive phases of the acquaintance were marked each\r\nwith a flame.\r\n\r\nThe flames were gathering thick at present, for Stransom had entered that\r\ndark defile of our earthly descent in which some one dies every day.  It\r\nwas only yesterday that Kate Creston had flashed out her white fire; yet\r\nalready there were younger stars ablaze on the tips of the tapers.\r\nVarious persons in whom his interest had not been intense drew closer to\r\nhim by entering this company.  He went over it, head by head, till he\r\nfelt like the shepherd of a huddled flock, with all a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s vision\r\nof differences imperceptible.  He knew his candles apart, up to the\r\ncolour of the flame, and would still have known them had their positions\r\nall been changed.  To other imaginations they might stand for other\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94that they should stand for something to be hushed before was all\r\nhe desired; but he was intensely conscious of the personal note of each\r\nand of the distinguishable way it contributed to the concert.  There were\r\nhours at which he almost caught himself wishing that certain of his\r\nfriends would now die, that he might establish with them in this manner a\r\nconnexion more charming than, as it happened, it was possible to enjoy\r\nwith them in life.  In regard to those from whom one was separated by the\r\nlong curves of the globe such a connexion could only be an improvement:\r\nit brought them instantly within reach.  Of course there were gaps in the\r\nconstellation, for Stransom knew he could only pretend to act for his\r\nown, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t every figure passing before his eyes into the great\r\nobscure that was entitled to a memorial.  There was a strange\r\nsanctification in death, but some characters were more sanctified by\r\nbeing forgotten than by being remembered.  The greatest blank in the\r\nshining page was the memory of Acton Hague, of which he inveterately\r\ntried to rid himself.  For Acton Hague no flame could ever rise on any\r\naltar of his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery year, the day he walked back from the great graveyard, he went to\r\nchurch as he had done the day his idea was born.  It was on this\r\noccasion, as it happened, after a year had passed, that he began to\r\nobserve his altar to be haunted by a worshipper at least as frequent as\r\nhimself.  Others of the faithful, and in the rest of the church, came and\r\nwent, appealing sometimes, when they disappeared, to a vague or to a\r\nparticular recognition; but this unfailing presence was always to be\r\nobserved when he arrived and still in possession when he departed.  He\r\nwas surprised, the first time, at the promptitude with which it assumed\r\nan identity for him\xe2\x80\x94the identity of the lady whom two years before, on\r\nhis anniversary, he had seen so intensely bowed, and of whose tragic face\r\nhe had had so flitting a vision.  Given the time that had passed, his\r\nrecollection of her was fresh enough to make him wonder.  Of himself she\r\nhad of course no impression, or rather had had none at first: the time\r\ncame when her manner of transacting her business suggested her having\r\ngradually guessed his call to be of the same order.  She used his altar\r\nfor her own purpose\xe2\x80\x94he could only hope that sad and solitary as she\r\nalways struck him, she used it for her own Dead.  There were\r\ninterruptions, infidelities, all on his part, calls to other associations\r\nand duties; but as the months went on he found her whenever he returned,\r\nand he ended by taking pleasure in the thought that he had given her\r\nalmost the contentment he had given himself.  They worshipped side by\r\nside so often that there were moments when he wished he might be sure, so\r\nstraight did their prospect stretch away of growing old together in their\r\nrites.  She was younger than he, but she looked as if her Dead were at\r\nleast as numerous as his candles.  She had no colour, no sound, no fault,\r\nand another of the things about which he had made up his mind was that\r\nshe had no fortune.  Always black-robed, she must have had a succession\r\nof sorrows.  People weren\xe2\x80\x99t poor, after all, whom so many losses could\r\novertake; they were positively rich when they had had so much to give up.\r\nBut the air of this devoted and indifferent woman, who always made, in\r\nany attitude, a beautiful accidental line, conveyed somehow to Stransom\r\nthat she had known more kinds of trouble than one.\r\n\r\nHe had a great love of music and little time for the joy of it; but\r\noccasionally, when workaday noises were muffled by Saturday afternoons,\r\nit used to come back to him that there were glories.  There were moreover\r\nfriends who reminded him of this and side by side with whom he found\r\nhimself sitting out concerts.  On one of these winter afternoons, in St.\r\nJames\xe2\x80\x99s Hall, he became aware after he had seated himself that the lady\r\nhe had so often seen at church was in the place next him and was\r\nevidently alone, as he also this time happened to be.  She was at first\r\ntoo absorbed in the consideration of the programme to heed him, but when\r\nshe at last glanced at him he took advantage of the movement to speak to\r\nher, greeting her with the remark that he felt as if he already knew her.\r\nShe smiled as she said \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I recognise you\xe2\x80\x9d; yet in spite of this\r\nadmission of long acquaintance it was the first he had seen of her smile.\r\nThe effect of it was suddenly to contribute more to that acquaintance\r\nthan all the previous meetings had done.  He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9ctaken in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nto himself, that she was so pretty.  Later, that evening\xe2\x80\x94it was while he\r\nrolled along in a hansom on his way to dine out\xe2\x80\x94he added that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntaken in that she was so interesting.  The next morning in the midst of\r\nhis work he quite suddenly and irrelevantly reflected that his impression\r\nof her, beginning so far back, was like a winding river that had at last\r\nreached the sea.\r\n\r\nHis work in fact was blurred a little all that day by the sense of what\r\nhad now passed between them.  It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much, but it had just made the\r\ndifference.  They had listened together to Beethoven and Schumann; they\r\nhad talked in the pauses, and at the end, when at the door, to which they\r\nmoved together, he had asked her if he could help her in the matter of\r\ngetting away.  She had thanked him and put up her umbrella, slipping into\r\nthe crowd without an allusion to their meeting yet again and leaving him\r\nto remember at leisure that not a word had been exchanged about the usual\r\nscene of that coincidence.  This omission struck him now as natural and\r\nthen again as perverse.  She mightn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least have allowed his\r\nwarrant for speaking to her, and yet if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he would have judged\r\nher an underbred woman.  It was odd that when nothing had really ever\r\nbrought them together he should have been able successfully to assume\r\nthey were in a manner old friends\xe2\x80\x94that this negative quantity was somehow\r\nmore than they could express.  His success, it was true, had been\r\nqualified by her quick escape, so that there grew up in him an absurd\r\ndesire to put it to some better test.  Save in so far as some other poor\r\nchance might help him, such a test could be only to meet her afresh at\r\nchurch.  Left to himself he would have gone to church the very next\r\nafternoon, just for the curiosity of seeing if he should find her there.\r\nBut he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t left to himself, a fact he discovered quite at the last,\r\nafter he had virtually made up his mind to go.  The influence that kept\r\nhim away really revealed to him how little to himself his Dead _ever_\r\nleft him.  He went only for _them_\xe2\x80\x94for nothing else in the world.\r\n\r\nThe force of this revulsion kept him away ten days: he hated to connect\r\nthe place with anything but his offices or to give a glimpse of the\r\ncuriosity that had been on the point of moving him.  It was absurd to\r\nweave a tangle about a matter so simple as a custom of devotion that\r\nmight with ease have been daily or hourly; yet the tangle got itself\r\nwoven.  He was sorry, he was disappointed: it was as if a long happy\r\nspell had been broken and he had lost a familiar security.  At the last,\r\nhowever, he asked himself if he was to stay away for ever from the fear\r\nof this muddle about motives.  After an interval neither longer nor\r\nshorter than usual he re-entered the church with a clear conviction that\r\nhe should scarcely heed the presence or the absence of the lady of the\r\nconcert.  This indifference didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent his at once noting that for\r\nthe only time since he had first seen her she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the spot.  He had\r\nnow no scruple about giving her time to arrive, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive,\r\nand when he went away still missing her he was profanely and consentingly\r\nsorry.  If her absence made the tangle more intricate, that was all her\r\nown doing.  By the end of another year it was very intricate indeed; but\r\nby that time he didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least care, and it was only his cultivated\r\nconsciousness that had given him scruples.  Three times in three months\r\nhe had gone to church without finding her, and he felt he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t needed\r\nthese occasions to show him his suspense had dropped.  Yet it was,\r\nincongruously, not indifference, but a refinement of delicacy that had\r\nkept him from asking the sacristan, who would of course immediately have\r\nrecognised his description of her, whether she had been seen at other\r\nhours.  His delicacy had kept him from asking any question about her at\r\nany time, and it was exactly the same virtue that had left him so free to\r\nbe decently civil to her at the concert.\r\n\r\nThis happy advantage now served him anew, enabling him when she finally\r\nmet his eyes\xe2\x80\x94it was after a fourth trial\xe2\x80\x94to predetermine quite fixedly\r\nhis awaiting her retreat.  He joined her in the street as soon as she had\r\nmoved, asking her if he might accompany her a certain distance.  With her\r\nplacid permission he went as far as a house in the neighbourhood at which\r\nshe had business: she let him know it was not where she lived.  She\r\nlived, as she said, in a mere slum, with an old aunt, a person in\r\nconnexion with whom she spoke of the engrossment of humdrum duties and\r\nregular occupations.  She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, the mourning niece, in her first youth,\r\nand her vanished freshness had left something behind that, for Stransom,\r\nrepresented the proof it had been tragically sacrificed.  Whatever she\r\ngave him the assurance of she gave without references.  She might have\r\nbeen a divorced duchess\xe2\x80\x94she might have been an old maid who taught the\r\nharp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey fell at last into the way of walking together almost every time they\r\nmet, though for a long time still they never met but at church.  He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her to come and see him, and as if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a proper place\r\nto receive him she never invited her friend.  As much as himself she knew\r\nthe world of London, but from an undiscussed instinct of privacy they\r\nhaunted the region not mapped on the social chart.  On the return she\r\nalways made him leave her at the same corner.  She looked with him, as a\r\npretext for a pause, at the depressed things in suburban shop-fronts; and\r\nthere was never a word he had said to her that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t beautifully\r\nunderstood.  For long ages he never knew her name, any more than she had\r\never pronounced his own; but it was not their names that mattered, it was\r\nonly their perfect practice and their common need.\r\n\r\nThese things made their whole relation so impersonal that they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nrules or reasons people found in ordinary friendships.  They didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nfor the things it was supposed necessary to care for in the intercourse\r\nof the world.  They ended one day\xe2\x80\x94they never knew which of them expressed\r\nit first\xe2\x80\x94by throwing out the idea that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for each other.\r\nOver this idea they grew quite intimate; they rallied to it in a way that\r\nmarked a fresh start in their confidence.  If to feel deeply together\r\nabout certain things wholly distinct from themselves didn\xe2\x80\x99t constitute a\r\nsafety, where was safety to be looked for?  Not lightly nor often, not\r\nwithout occasion nor without emotion, any more than in any other\r\nreference by serious people to a mystery of their faith; but when\r\nsomething had happened to warm, as it were, the air for it, they came as\r\nnear as they could come to calling their Dead by name.  They felt it was\r\ncoming very near to utter their thought at all.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexpressed enough; it limited the mention, it had a dignity of its own,\r\nand if, in their talk, you had heard our friends use it, you might have\r\ntaken them for a pair of pagans of old alluding decently to the\r\ndomesticated gods.  They never knew\xe2\x80\x94at least Stransom never knew\xe2\x80\x94how they\r\nhad learned to be sure about each other.  If it had been with each a\r\nquestion of what the other was there for, the certitude had come in some\r\nfine way of its own.  Any faith, after all, has the instinct of\r\npropagation, and it was as natural as it was beautiful that they should\r\nhave taken pleasure on the spot in the imagination of a following.  If\r\nthe following was for each but a following of one it had proved in the\r\nevent sufficient.  Her debt, however, of course was much greater than\r\nhis, because while she had only given him a worshipper he had given her a\r\nsplendid temple.  Once she said she pitied him for the length of his\r\nlist\xe2\x80\x94she had counted his candles almost as often as himself\xe2\x80\x94and this made\r\nhim wonder what could have been the length of hers.  He had wondered\r\nbefore at the coincidence of their losses, especially as from time to\r\ntime a new candle was set up.  On some occasion some accident led him to\r\nexpress this curiosity, and she answered as if in surprise that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalready understood.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh for me, you know, the more there are the\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x94there could never be too many.  I should like hundreds and\r\nhundreds\xe2\x80\x94I should like thousands; I should like a great mountain of\r\nlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen of course in a flash he understood.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour Dead are only One?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hung back at this as never yet.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnly One,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, colouring\r\nas if now he knew her guarded secret.  It really made him feel he knew\r\nless than before, so difficult was it for him to reconstitute a life in\r\nwhich a single experience had so belittled all others.  His own life,\r\nround its central hollow, had been packed close enough.  After this she\r\nappeared to have regretted her confession, though at the moment she spoke\r\nthere had been pride in her very embarrassment.  She declared to him that\r\nhis own was the larger, the dearer possession\xe2\x80\x94the portion one would have\r\nchosen if one had been able to choose; she assured him she could\r\nperfectly imagine some of the echoes with which his silences were\r\npeopled.  He knew she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t: one\xe2\x80\x99s relation to what one had loved and\r\nhated had been a relation too distinct from the relations of others.  But\r\nthis didn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the fact that they were growing old together in their\r\npiety.  She was a feature of that piety, but even at the ripe stage of\r\nacquaintance in which they occasionally arranged to meet at a concert or\r\nto go together to an exhibition she was not a feature of anything else.\r\nThe most that happened was that his worship became paramount.  Friend by\r\nfriend dropped away till at last there were more emblems on his altar\r\nthan houses left him to enter.  She was more than any other the friend\r\nwho remained, but she was unknown to all the rest.  Once when she had\r\ndiscovered, as they called it, a new star, she used the expression that\r\nthe chapel at last was full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d Stransom replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a great thing wanting for that!  The\r\nchapel will never be full till a candle is set up before which all the\r\nothers will pale.  It will be the tallest candle of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mild wonder rested on him.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat candle do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, dear lady, my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had learned after a long time that she earned money by her pen,\r\nwriting under a pseudonym she never disclosed in magazines he never saw.\r\nShe knew too well what he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read and what she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write, and\r\nshe taught him to cultivate indifference with a success that did much for\r\ntheir good relations.  Her invisible industry was a convenience to him;\r\nit helped his contented thought of her, the thought that rested in the\r\ndignity of her proud obscure life, her little remunerated art and her\r\nlittle impenetrable home.  Lost, with her decayed relative, in her dim\r\nsuburban world, she came to the surface for him in distant places.  She\r\nwas really the priestess of his altar, and whenever he quitted England he\r\ncommitted it to her keeping.  She proved to him afresh that women have\r\nmore of the spirit of religion than men; he felt his fidelity pale and\r\nfaint in comparison with hers.  He often said to her that since he had so\r\nlittle time to live he rejoiced in her having so much; so glad was he to\r\nthink she would guard the temple when he should have been called.  He had\r\na great plan for that, which of course he told her too, a bequest of\r\nmoney to keep it up in undiminished state.  Of the administration of this\r\nfund he would appoint her superintendent, and if the spirit should move\r\nher she might kindle a taper even for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who will kindle one even for me?\xe2\x80\x9d she then seriously asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was always in mourning, yet the day he came back from the longest\r\nabsence he had yet made her appearance immediately told him she had\r\nlately had a bereavement.  They met on this occasion as she was leaving\r\nthe church, so that postponing his own entrance he instantly offered to\r\nturn round and walk away with her.  She considered, then she said: \xe2\x80\x9cGo in\r\nnow, but come and see me in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d  He knew the small vista of her\r\nstreet, closed at the end and as dreary as an empty pocket, where the\r\npairs of shabby little houses, semi-detached but indissolubly united,\r\nwere like married couples on bad terms.  Often, however, as he had gone\r\nto the beginning he had never gone beyond.  Her aunt was dead\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nimmediately guessed, as well as that it made a difference; but when she\r\nhad for the first time mentioned her number he found himself, on her\r\nleaving him, not a little agitated by this sudden liberality.  She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na person with whom, after all, one got on so very fast: it had taken him\r\nmonths and months to learn her name, years and years to learn her\r\naddress.  If she had looked, on this reunion, so much older to him, how\r\nin the world did he look to her?  She had reached the period of life he\r\nhad long since reached, when, after separations, the marked clock-face of\r\nthe friend we meet announces the hour we have tried to forget.  He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said what he expected as, at the end of his waiting, he\r\nturned the corner where for years he had always paused; simply not to\r\npause was a efficient cause for emotion.  It was an event, somehow; and\r\nin all their long acquaintance there had never been an event.  This one\r\ngrew larger when, five minutes later, in the faint elegance of her little\r\ndrawing-room, she quavered out a greeting that showed the measure she\r\ntook of it.  He had a strange sense of having come for something in\r\nparticular; strange because literally there was nothing particular\r\nbetween them, nothing save that they were at one on their great point,\r\nwhich had long ago become a magnificent matter of course.  It was true\r\nthat after she had said \xe2\x80\x9cYou can always come now, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d the thing he\r\nwas there for seemed already to have happened.  He asked her if it was\r\nthe death of her aunt that made the difference; to which she replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never knew I knew you.  I wished her not to.\xe2\x80\x9d  The beautiful\r\nclearness of her candour\xe2\x80\x94her faded beauty was like a summer\r\ntwilight\xe2\x80\x94disconnected the words from any image of deceit.  They might\r\nhave struck him as the record of a deep dissimulation; but she had always\r\ngiven him a sense of noble reasons.  The vanished aunt was present, as he\r\nlooked about him, in the small complacencies of the room, the beaded\r\nvelvet and the fluted moreen; and though, as we know, he had the worship\r\nof the Dead, he found himself not definitely regretting this lady.  If\r\nshe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in his long list, however, she was in her niece\xe2\x80\x99s short one,\r\nand Stransom presently observed to the latter that now at least, in the\r\nplace they haunted together, she would have another object of devotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall have another.  She was very kind to me.  It\xe2\x80\x99s that that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe judged, wondering a good deal before he made any motion to leave her,\r\nthat the difference would somehow be very great and would consist of\r\nstill other things than her having let him come in.  It rather chilled\r\nhim, for they had been happy together as they were.  He extracted from\r\nher at any rate an intimation that she should now have means less\r\nlimited, that her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s tiny fortune had come to her, so that there was\r\nhenceforth only one to consume what had formerly been made to suffice for\r\ntwo.  This was a joy to Stransom, because it had hitherto been equally\r\nimpossible for him either to offer her presents or contentedly to stay\r\nhis hand.  It was too ugly to be at her side that way, abounding himself\r\nand yet not able to overflow\xe2\x80\x94a demonstration that would have been\r\nsignally a false note.  Even her better situation too seemed only to draw\r\nout in a sense the loneliness of her future.  It would merely help her to\r\nlive more and more for their small ceremonial, and this at a time when he\r\nhimself had begun wearily to feel that, having set it in motion, he might\r\ndepart.  When they had sat a while in the pale parlour she got up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t my room: let us go into mine.\xe2\x80\x9d  They had only to cross the narrow\r\nhall, as he found, to pass quite into another air.  When she had closed\r\nthe door of the second room, as she called it, he felt at last in real\r\npossession of her.  The place had the flush of life\xe2\x80\x94it was expressive;\r\nits dark red walls were articulate with memories and relics.  These were\r\nsimple things\xe2\x80\x94photographs and water-colours, scraps of writing framed and\r\nghosts of flowers embalmed; but a moment sufficed to show him they had a\r\ncommon meaning.  It was here she had lived and worked, and she had\r\nalready told him she would make no change of scene.  He read the\r\nreference in the objects about her\xe2\x80\x94the general one to places and times;\r\nbut after a minute he distinguished among them a small portrait of a\r\ngentleman.  At a distance and without their glasses his eyes were only so\r\ncaught by it as to feel a vague curiosity.  Presently this impulse\r\ncarried him nearer, and in another moment he was staring at the picture\r\nin stupefaction and with the sense that some sound had broken from him.\r\nHe was further conscious that he showed his companion a white face when\r\nhe turned round on her gasping: \xe2\x80\x9cActon Hague!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe matched his great wonder.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was the friend of all my youth\xe2\x80\x94of my early manhood.  And _you_ knew\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe coloured at this and for a moment her answer failed; her eyes\r\nembraced everything in the place, and a strange irony reached her lips as\r\nshe echoed: \xe2\x80\x9cKnew him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Stransom understood, while the room heaved like the cabin of a ship,\r\nthat its whole contents cried out with him, that it was a museum in his\r\nhonour, that all her later years had been addressed to him and that the\r\nshrine he himself had reared had been passionately converted to this use.\r\nIt was all for Acton Hague that she had kneeled every day at his altar.\r\nWhat need had there been for a consecrated candle when he was present in\r\nthe whole array? The revelation so smote our friend in the face that he\r\ndropped into a seat and sat silent.  He had quickly felt her shaken by\r\nthe force of his shock, but as she sank on the sofa beside him and laid\r\nher hand on his arm he knew almost as soon that she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t resent it as\r\nmuch as she\xe2\x80\x99d have liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe learned in that instant two things: one being that even in so long a\r\ntime she had gathered no knowledge of his great intimacy and his great\r\nquarrel; the other that in spite of this ignorance, strangely enough, she\r\nsupplied on the spot a reason for his stupor.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npresently exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we should never have known!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a wan smile which seemed to Stransom stranger even than the fact\r\nitself.  \xe2\x80\x9cI never, never spoke of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked again about the room.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy then, if your life had been so full\r\nof him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayn\xe2\x80\x99t I put you that question as well?  Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t your life also been full\r\nof him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny one\xe2\x80\x99s, every one\xe2\x80\x99s life who had the wonderful experience of knowing\r\nhim.  _I_ never spoke of him,\xe2\x80\x9d Stransom added in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he\r\ndid me\xe2\x80\x94years ago\xe2\x80\x94an unforgettable wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  She was silent, and with the\r\nfull effect of his presence all about them it almost startled her guest\r\nto hear no protest escape her.  She accepted his words, he turned his\r\neyes to her again to see in what manner she accepted them.  It was with\r\nrising tears and a rare sweetness in the movement of putting out her hand\r\nto take his own.  Nothing more wonderful had ever appeared to him than,\r\nin that little chamber of remembrance and homage, to see her convey with\r\nsuch exquisite mildness that as from Acton Hague any injury was credible.\r\nThe clock ticked in the stillness\xe2\x80\x94Hague had probably given it to her\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhile he let her hold his hand with a tenderness that was almost an\r\nassumption of responsibility for his old pain as well as his new,\r\nStransom after a minute broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cGood God, how he must have used\r\n_you_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped his hand at this, got up and, moving across the room, made\r\nstraight a small picture to which, on examining it, he had given a slight\r\npush.  Then turning round on him with her pale gaiety recovered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nforgiven him!\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stransom \xe2\x80\x9cI know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d  For a moment they looked at each other through it all with their\r\nlong community of service in their eyes.  This short passage made, to his\r\nsense, for the woman before him, an immense, an absolutely naked\r\nconfession; which was presently, suddenly blushing red and changing her\r\nplace again, what she appeared to learn he perceived in it.  He got up\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cHow you must have loved him!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen aren\xe2\x80\x99t like men.  They can love even where they\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen are wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stransom.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut I assure you I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgiven\r\nhim too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had known of anything so strange I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have brought you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that we might have gone on in our ignorance to the last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call the last?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, smiling still.\r\n\r\nAt this he could smile back at her.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see\xe2\x80\x94when it comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought of that.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is better perhaps; but as we were\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put her the question.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid it never happen that he spoke of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConsidering more intently she made no answer, and he then knew he should\r\nhave been adequately answered by her asking how often he himself had\r\nspoken of their terrible friend.  Suddenly a brighter light broke in her\r\nface and an excited idea sprang to her lips in the appeal: \xe2\x80\x9cYou _have_\r\nforgiven him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, could I linger here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe visibly winced at the deep but unintended irony of this; but even\r\nwhile she did so she panted quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cThen in the lights on your altar\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s never a light for Acton Hague!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared with a dreadful fall, \xe2\x80\x9cBut if he\xe2\x80\x99s one of your Dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s, if you like\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s one of yours.  But he\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\none of mine.  Mine are only the Dead who died possessed of me.  They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmine in death because they were mine in life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He _was yours in life then, even if for a while he ceased to be.  If\r\nyou forgave him you went back to him.  Those whom we\xe2\x80\x99ve once loved\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre those who can hurt us most,\xe2\x80\x9d Stransom broke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh it\xe2\x80\x99s not true\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve _not_ forgiven him!\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed with a passion\r\nthat startled him.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her as never yet.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it he did to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything!\xe2\x80\x9d  Then abruptly she put out her hand in farewell.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned as cold as he had turned that night he read the man\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that we meet no more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as we\xe2\x80\x99ve met\xe2\x80\x94not _there_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood aghast at this snap of their great bond, at the renouncement\r\nthat rang out in the word she so expressively sounded.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchanged\xe2\x80\x94for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited in all the sharpness of a trouble that for the first time\r\nsince he had known her made her splendidly stern.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you\r\nunderstand now when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand before only because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.  Now that I know,\r\nI see what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been living with for years,\xe2\x80\x9d Stransom went on very\r\ngently.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a larger allowance, doing this gentleness justice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I then, on this new knowledge of my own, ask you to continue to\r\nlive with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI set up my altar, with its multiplied meanings,\xe2\x80\x9d Stransom began; but\r\nshe quietly interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou set up your altar, and when I wanted one most I found it\r\nmagnificently ready.  I used it with the gratitude I\xe2\x80\x99ve always shown you,\r\nfor I knew it from of old to be dedicated to Death.  I told you long ago\r\nthat my Dead weren\xe2\x80\x99t many.  Yours were, but all you had done for them was\r\nnone too much for _my_ worship!  You had placed a great light for Each\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ngathered them together for One!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had simply different intentions,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat, as you say, I\r\nperfectly knew, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why your intention shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t still\r\nsustain you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re generous\xe2\x80\x94you can imagine and think.  But the spell\r\nis broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to poor Stransom, in spite of his resistance, that it really\r\nwas, and the prospect stretched grey and void before him.  All he could\r\nsay, however, was: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll try before you give up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had known you had ever known him I should have taken for granted he\r\nhad his candle,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s changed, as you say, is\r\nthat on making the discovery I find he never has had it.  That makes _my_\r\nattitude\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she paused as thinking how to express it, then said simply\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome once again,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give him his candle?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe waited, but only because it would sound ungracious; not because of a\r\ndoubt of his feeling.  \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do that!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she gave him her hand again.\r\n\r\nHe had got his dismissal; besides which, in the agitation of everything\r\nthat had opened out to him, he felt the need to recover himself as he\r\ncould only do in solitude.  Yet he lingered\xe2\x80\x94lingered to see if she had no\r\ncompromise to express, no attenuation to propose.  But he only met her\r\ngreat lamenting eyes, in which indeed he read that she was as sorry for\r\nhim as for any one else.  This made him say: \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, in any case, I\r\nmay see you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, come if you like.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked round the room once more, knowing how little he was sure it\r\nwould do.  He felt also stricken and more and more cold, and his chill\r\nwas like an ague in which he had to make an effort not to shake.  Then he\r\nmade doleful reply: \xe2\x80\x9cI must try on my side\xe2\x80\x94if you can\xe2\x80\x99t try on yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe came out with him to the hall and into the doorway, and here he put\r\nher the question he held he could least answer from his own wit.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nhave you never let me come before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause my aunt would have seen you, and I should have had to tell her\r\nhow I came to know you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would have been the objection to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have entailed other explanations; there would at any rate have\r\nbeen that danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely she knew you went every day to church,\xe2\x80\x9d Stransom objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I went for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf me then she never even heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll think I was deceitful.  But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was now on the lower door-step, and his hostess held the door\r\nhalf-closed behind him.  Through what remained of the opening he saw her\r\nframed face.  He made a supreme appeal.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _did_ he do to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have come out\xe2\x80\x94_she _would have told you.  That fear at my\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94that was my reason!\xe2\x80\x9d  And she closed the door, shutting him out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had ruthlessly abandoned her\xe2\x80\x94that of course was what he had done.\r\nStransom made it all out in solitude, at leisure, fitting the unmatched\r\npieces gradually together and dealing one by one with a hundred obscure\r\npoints.  She had known Hague only after her present friend\xe2\x80\x99s relations\r\nwith him had wholly terminated; obviously indeed a good while after; and\r\nit was natural enough that of his previous life she should have\r\nascertained only what he had judged good to communicate.  There were\r\npassages it was quite conceivable that even in moments of the tenderest\r\nexpansion he should have withheld.  Of many facts in the career of a man\r\nso in the eye of the world there was of course a common knowledge; but\r\nthis lady lived apart from public affairs, and the only time perfectly\r\nclear to her would have been the time following the dawn of her own\r\ndrama.  A man in her place would have \xe2\x80\x9clooked up\xe2\x80\x9d the past\xe2\x80\x94would even\r\nhave consulted old newspapers.  It remained remarkable indeed that in her\r\nlong contact with the partner of her retrospect no accident had lighted a\r\ntrain; but there was no arguing about that; the accident had in fact\r\ncome: it had simply been that security had prevailed.  She had taken what\r\nHague had given her, and her blankness in respect of his other connexions\r\nwas only a touch in the picture of that plasticity Stransom had supreme\r\nreason to know so great a master could have been trusted to produce.\r\n\r\nThis picture was for a while all our friend saw: he caught his breath\r\nagain and again as it came over him that the woman with whom he had had\r\nfor years so fine a point of contact was a woman whom Acton Hague, of all\r\nmen in the world, had more or less fashioned.  Such as she sat there\r\nto-day she was ineffaceably stamped with him.  Beneficent, blameless as\r\nStransom held her, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rid himself of the sense that he had been,\r\nas who should say, swindled.  She had imposed upon him hugely, though she\r\nhad known it as little as he.  All this later past came back to him as a\r\ntime grotesquely misspent.  Such at least were his first reflexions;\r\nafter a while he found himself more divided and only, as the end of it,\r\nmore troubled.  He imagined, recalled, reconstituted, figured out for\r\nhimself the truth she had refused to give him; the effect of which was to\r\nmake her seem to him only more saturated with her fate.  He felt her\r\nspirit, through the whole strangeness, finer than his own to the very\r\ndegree in which she might have been, in which she certainly had been,\r\nmore wronged.  A women, when wronged, was always more wronged than a man,\r\nand there were conditions when the least she could have got off with was\r\nmore than the most he could have to bear.  He was sure this rare creature\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got off with the least.  He was awestruck at the thought of\r\nsuch a surrender\xe2\x80\x94such a prostration.  Moulded indeed she had been by\r\npowerful hands, to have converted her injury into an exaltation so\r\nsublime.  The fellow had only had to die for everything that was ugly in\r\nhim to be washed out in a torrent.  It was vain to try to guess what had\r\ntaken place, but nothing could be clearer than that she had ended by\r\naccusing herself.  She absolved him at every point, she adored her very\r\nwounds.  The passion by which he had profited had rushed back after its\r\nebb, and now the tide of tenderness, arrested for ever at flood, was too\r\ndeep even to fathom.  Stransom sincerely considered that he had forgiven\r\nhim; but how little he had achieved the miracle that she had achieved!\r\nHis forgiveness was silence, but hers was mere unuttered sound.  The\r\nlight she had demanded for his altar would have broken his silence with a\r\nblare; whereas all the lights in the church were for her too great a\r\nhush.\r\n\r\nShe had been right about the difference\xe2\x80\x94she had spoken the truth about\r\nthe change: Stransom was soon to know himself as perversely but sharply\r\njealous.  _His_ tide had ebbed, not flowed; if he had \xe2\x80\x9cforgiven\xe2\x80\x9d Acton\r\nHague, that forgiveness was a motive with a broken spring.  The very fact\r\nof her appeal for a material sign, a sign that should make her dead lover\r\nequal there with the others, presented the concession to her friend as\r\ntoo handsome for the case.  He had never thought of himself as hard, but\r\nan exorbitant article might easily render him so.  He moved round and\r\nround this one, but only in widening circles\xe2\x80\x94the more he looked at it the\r\nless acceptable it seemed.  At the same time he had no illusion about the\r\neffect of his refusal; he perfectly saw how it would make for a rupture.\r\nHe left her alone a week, but when at last he again called this\r\nconviction was cruelly confirmed.  In the interval he had kept away from\r\nthe church, and he needed no fresh assurance from her to know she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nentered it.  The change was complete enough: it had broken up her life.\r\nIndeed it had broken up his, for all the fires of his shrine seemed to\r\nhim suddenly to have been quenched.  A great indifference fell upon him,\r\nthe weight of which was in itself a pain; and he never knew what his\r\ndevotion had been for him till in that shock it ceased like a dropped\r\nwatch.  Neither did he know with how large a confidence he had counted on\r\nthe final service that had now failed: the mortal deception was that in\r\nthis abandonment the whole future gave way.\r\n\r\nThese days of her absence proved to him of what she was capable; all the\r\nmore that he never dreamed she was vindictive or even resentful.  It was\r\nnot in anger she had forsaken him; it was in simple submission to hard\r\nreality, to the stern logic of life.  This came home to him when he sat\r\nwith her again in the room in which her late aunt\xe2\x80\x99s conversation lingered\r\nlike the tone of a cracked piano.  She tried to make him forget how much\r\nthey were estranged, but in the very presence of what they had given up\r\nit was impossible not to be sorry for her.  He had taken from her so much\r\nmore than she had taken from him.  He argued with her again, told her she\r\ncould now have the altar to herself; but she only shook her head with\r\npleading sadness, begging him not to waste his breath on the impossible,\r\nthe extinct.  Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he see that in relation to her private need the\r\nrites he had established were practically an elaborate exclusion?  She\r\nregretted nothing that had happened; it had all been right so long as she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and it was only that now she knew too much and that from the\r\nmoment their eyes were open they would simply have to conform.  It had\r\ndoubtless been happiness enough for them to go on together so long.  She\r\nwas gentle, grateful, resigned; but this was only the form of a deep\r\nimmoveability.  He saw he should never more cross the threshold of the\r\nsecond room, and he felt how much this alone would make a stranger of him\r\nand give a conscious stiffness to his visits.  He would have hated to\r\nplunge again into that well of reminders, but he enjoyed quite as little\r\nthe vacant alternative.\r\n\r\nAfter he had been with her three or four times it struck him that to have\r\ncome at last into her house had had the horrid effect of diminishing\r\ntheir intimacy.  He had known her better, had liked her in greater\r\nfreedom, when they merely walked together or kneeled together.  Now they\r\nonly pretended; before they had been nobly sincere.  They began to try\r\ntheir walks again, but it proved a lame imitation, for these things, from\r\nthe first, beginning or ending, had been connected with their visits to\r\nthe church.  They had either strolled away as they came out or gone in to\r\nrest on the return.  Stransom, besides, now faltered; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk as\r\nof old.  The omission made everything false; it was a dire mutilation of\r\ntheir lives.  Our friend was frank and monotonous, making no mystery of\r\nhis remonstrance and no secret of his predicament.  Her response,\r\nwhatever it was, always came to the same thing\xe2\x80\x94an implied invitation to\r\nhim to judge, if he spoke of predicaments, of how much comfort she had in\r\nhers.  For him indeed was no comfort even in complaint, since every\r\nallusion to what had befallen them but made the author of their trouble\r\nmore present.  Acton Hague was between them\xe2\x80\x94that was the essence of the\r\nmatter, and never so much between them as when they were face to face.\r\nThen Stransom, while still wanting to banish him, had the strangest sense\r\nof striving for an ease that would involve having accepted him.  Deeply\r\ndisconcerted by what he knew, he was still worse tormented by really not\r\nknowing.  Perfectly aware that it would have been horribly vulgar to\r\nabuse his old friend or to tell his companion the story of their quarrel,\r\nit yet vexed him that her depth of reserve should give him no opening and\r\nshould have the effect of a magnanimity greater even than his own.\r\n\r\nHe challenged himself, denounced himself, asked himself if he were in\r\nlove with her that he should care so much what adventures she had had.\r\nHe had never for a moment allowed he was in love with her; therefore\r\nnothing could have surprised him more than to discover he was jealous.\r\nWhat but jealousy could give a man that sore contentious wish for the\r\ndetail of what would make him suffer?  Well enough he knew indeed that he\r\nshould never have it from the only person who to-day could give it to\r\nhim.  She let him press her with his sombre eyes, only smiling at him\r\nwith an exquisite mercy and breathing equally little the word that would\r\nexpose her secret and the word that would appear to deny his literal\r\nright to bitterness.  She told nothing, she judged nothing; she accepted\r\neverything but the possibility of her return to the old symbols.\r\nStransom divined that for her too they had been vividly individual, had\r\nstood for particular hours or particular attributes\xe2\x80\x94particular links in\r\nher chain.  He made it clear to himself, as he believed, that his\r\ndifficulty lay in the fact that the very nature of the plea for his\r\nfaithless friend constituted a prohibition; that it happened to have come\r\nfrom _her_ was precisely the vice that attached to it.  To the voice of\r\nimpersonal generosity he felt sure he would have listened; he would have\r\ndeferred to an advocate who, speaking from abstract justice, knowing of\r\nhis denial without having known Hague, should have had the imagination to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, remember only the best of him; pity him; provide for him.\xe2\x80\x9d  To\r\nprovide for him on the very ground of having discovered another of his\r\nturpitudes was not to pity but to glorify him.  The more Stransom thought\r\nthe more he made out that whatever this relation of Hague\xe2\x80\x99s it could only\r\nhave been a deception more or less finely practised.  Where had it come\r\ninto the life that all men saw?  Why had one never heard of it if it had\r\nhad the frankness of honourable things?  Stransom knew enough of his\r\nother ties, of his obligations and appearances, not to say enough of his\r\ngeneral character, to be sure there had been some infamy.  In one way or\r\nanother this creature had been coldly sacrificed.  That was why at the\r\nlast as well as the first he must still leave him out and out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet this was no solution, especially after he had talked again to his\r\nfriend of all it had been his plan she should finally do for him.  He had\r\ntalked in the other days, and she had responded with a frankness\r\nqualified only by a courteous reluctance, a reluctance that touched him,\r\nto linger on the question of his death.  She had then practically\r\naccepted the charge, suffered him to feel he could depend upon her to be\r\nthe eventual guardian of his shrine; and it was in the name of what had\r\nso passed between them that he appealed to her not to forsake him in his\r\nage.  She listened at present with shining coldness and all her habitual\r\nforbearance to insist on her terms; her deprecation was even still\r\ntenderer, for it expressed the compassion of her own sense that he was\r\nabandoned.  Her terms, however, remained the same, and scarcely the less\r\naudible for not being uttered; though he was sure that secretly even more\r\nthan he she felt bereft of the satisfaction his solemn trust was to have\r\nprovided her.  They both missed the rich future, but she missed it most,\r\nbecause after all it was to have been entirely hers; and it was her\r\nacceptance of the loss that gave him the full measure of her preference\r\nfor the thought of Acton Hague over any other thought whatever.  He had\r\nhumour enough to laugh rather grimly when he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the\r\ndeuce does she like him so much more than she likes me?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the reasons\r\nbeing really so conceivable.  But even his faculty of analysis left the\r\nirritation standing, and this irritation proved perhaps the greatest\r\nmisfortune that had ever overtaken him.  There had been nothing yet that\r\nmade him so much want to give up.  He had of course by this time well\r\nreached the age of renouncement; but it had not hitherto been vivid to\r\nhim that it was time to give up everything.\r\n\r\nPractically, at the end of six months, he had renounced the friendship\r\nonce so charming and comforting.  His privation had two faces, and the\r\nface it had turned to him on the occasion of his last attempt to\r\ncultivate that friendship was the one he could look at least.  This was\r\nthe privation he inflicted; the other was the privation he bore.  The\r\nconditions she never phrased he used to murmur to himself in solitude:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more, one more\xe2\x80\x94only just one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Certainly he was going down; he\r\noften felt it when he caught himself, over his work, staring at vacancy\r\nand giving voice to that inanity.  There was proof enough besides in his\r\nbeing so weak and so ill.  His irritation took the form of melancholy,\r\nand his melancholy that of the conviction that his health had quite\r\nfailed.  His altar moreover had ceased to exist; his chapel, in his\r\ndreams, was a great dark cavern.  All the lights had gone out\xe2\x80\x94all his\r\nDead had died again.  He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly see at first how it had been in\r\nthe power of his late companion to extinguish them, since it was neither\r\nfor her nor by her that they had been called into being.  Then he\r\nunderstood that it was essentially in his own soul the revival had taken\r\nplace, and that in the air of this soul they were now unable to breathe.\r\nThe candles might mechanically burn, but each of them had lost its\r\nlustre.  The church had become a void; it was his presence, her presence,\r\ntheir common presence, that had made the indispensable medium.  If\r\nanything was wrong everything was\xe2\x80\x94her silence spoiled the tune.\r\n\r\nThen when three months were gone he felt so lonely that he went back;\r\nreflecting that as they had been his best society for years his Dead\r\nperhaps wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him forsake them without doing something more for\r\nhim.  They stood there, as he had left them, in their tall radiance, the\r\nbright cluster that had already made him, on occasions when he was\r\nwilling to compare small things with great, liken them to a group of\r\nsea-lights on the edge of the ocean of life.  It was a relief to him,\r\nafter a while, as he sat there, to feel they had still a virtue.  He was\r\nmore and more easily tired, and he always drove now; the action of his\r\nheart was weak and gave him none of the reassurance conferred by the\r\naction of his fancy.  None the less he returned yet again, returned\r\nseveral times, and finally, during six months, haunted the place with a\r\nrenewal of frequency and a strain of impatience.  In winter the church\r\nwas unwarmed and exposure to cold forbidden him, but the glow of his\r\nshrine was an influence in which he could almost bask.  He sat and\r\nwondered to what he had reduced his absent associate and what she now did\r\nwith the hours of her absence.  There were other churches, there were\r\nother altars, there were other candles; in one way or another her piety\r\nwould still operate; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t absolutely have deprived her of her\r\nrites.  So he argued, but without contentment; for he well enough knew\r\nthere was no other such rare semblance of the mountain of light she had\r\nonce mentioned to him as the satisfaction of her need.  As this semblance\r\nagain gradually grew great to him and his pious practice more regular, he\r\nfound a sharper and sharper pang in the imagination of her darkness; for\r\nnever so much as in these weeks had his rites been real, never had his\r\ngathered company seemed so to respond and even to invite.  He lost\r\nhimself in the large lustre, which was more and more what he had from the\r\nfirst wished it to be\xe2\x80\x94as dazzling as the vision of heaven in the mind of\r\na child.  He wandered in the fields of light; he passed, among the tall\r\ntapers, from tier to tier, from fire to fire, from name to name, from the\r\nwhite intensity of one clear emblem, of one saved soul, to another.  It\r\nwas in the quiet sense of having saved his souls that his deep strange\r\ninstinct rejoiced.  This was no dim theological rescue, no boon of a\r\ncontingent world; they were saved better than faith or works could save\r\nthem, saved for the warm world they had shrunk_ _from dying to, for\r\nactuality, for continuity, for the certainty of human remembrance.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had survived all his friends; the last straight flame was\r\nthree years old, there was no one to add to the list.  Over and over he\r\ncalled his roll, and it appeared to him compact and complete.  Where\r\nshould he put in another, where, if there were no other objection, would\r\nit stand in its place in the rank?  He reflected, with a want of\r\nsincerity of which he was quite conscious, that it would be difficult to\r\ndetermine that place.  More and more, besides, face to face with his\r\nlittle legion, over endless histories, handling the empty shells and\r\nplaying with the silence\xe2\x80\x94more and more he could see that he had never\r\nintroduced an alien.  He had had his great companions, his\r\nindulgences\xe2\x80\x94there were cases in which they had been immense; but what had\r\nhis devotion after all been if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been at bottom a respect?  He\r\nwas, however, himself surprised at his stiffness; by the end of the\r\nwinter the responsibility of it was what was uppermost in his thoughts.\r\nThe refrain had grown old to them, that plea for just one more.  There\r\ncame a day when, for simple exhaustion, if symmetry should demand just\r\none he was ready so far to meet symmetry.  Symmetry was harmony, and the\r\nidea of harmony began to haunt him; he said to himself that harmony was\r\nof course everything.  He took, in fancy, his composition to pieces,\r\nredistributing it into other lines, making other juxtapositions and\r\ncontrasts.  He shifted this and that candle, he made the spaces\r\ndifferent, he effaced the disfigurement of a possible gap.  There were\r\nsubtle and complex relations, a scheme of cross-reference, and moments in\r\nwhich he seemed to catch a glimpse of the void so sensible to the woman\r\nwho wandered in exile or sat where he had seen her with the portrait of\r\nActon Hague.  Finally, in this way, he arrived at a conception of the\r\ntotal, the ideal, which left a clear opportunity for just another figure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust one more\xe2\x80\x94to round it off; just one more, just one,\xe2\x80\x9d continued to\r\nhum in his head.  There was a strange confusion in the thought, for he\r\nfelt the day to be near when he too should be one of the Others.  What in\r\nthis event would the Others matter to him, since they only mattered to\r\nthe living?  Even as one of the Dead what would his altar matter to him,\r\nsince his particular dream of keeping it up had melted away?  What had\r\nharmony to do with the case if his lights were all to be quenched?  What\r\nhe had hoped for was an instituted thing.  He might perpetuate it on some\r\nother pretext, but his special meaning would have dropped.  This meaning\r\nwas to have lasted with the life of the one other person who understood\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn March he had an illness during which he spent a fortnight in bed, and\r\nwhen he revived a little he was told of two things that had happened.\r\nOne was that a lady whose name was not known to the servants (she left\r\nnone) had been three times to ask about him; the other was that in his\r\nsleep and on an occasion when his mind evidently wandered he was heard to\r\nmurmur again and again: \xe2\x80\x9cJust one more\xe2\x80\x94just one.\xe2\x80\x9d  As soon as he found\r\nhimself able to go out, and before the doctor in attendance had\r\npronounced him so, he drove to see the lady who had come to ask about\r\nhim.  She was not at home; but this gave him the opportunity, before his\r\nstrength should fall again, to take his way to the church.  He entered it\r\nalone; he had declined, in a happy manner he possessed of being able to\r\ndecline effectively, the company of his servant or of a nurse.  He knew\r\nnow perfectly what these good people thought; they had discovered his\r\nclandestine connexion, the magnet that had drawn him for so many years,\r\nand doubtless attached a significance of their own to the odd words they\r\nhad repeated to him.  The nameless lady was the clandestine connexion\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfact nothing could have made clearer than his indecent haste to rejoin\r\nher.  He sank on his knees before his altar while his head fell over on\r\nhis hands.  His weakness, his life\xe2\x80\x99s weariness overtook him.  It seemed\r\nto him he had come for the great surrender.  At first he asked himself\r\nhow he should get away; then, with the failing belief in the power, the\r\nvery desire to move gradually left him.  He had come, as he always came,\r\nto lose himself; the fields of light were still there to stray in; only\r\nthis time, in straying, he would never come back.  He had given himself\r\nto his Dead, and it was good: this time his Dead would keep him.  He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rise from his knees; he believed he should never rise again; all\r\nhe could do was to lift his face and fix his eyes on his lights.  They\r\nlooked unusually, strangely splendid, but the one that always drew him\r\nmost had an unprecedented lustre.  It was the central voice of the choir,\r\nthe glowing heart of the brightness, and on this occasion it seemed to\r\nexpand, to spread great wings of flame.  The whole altar flared\xe2\x80\x94dazzling\r\nand blinding; but the source of the vast radiance burned clearer than the\r\nrest, gathering itself into form, and the form was human beauty and human\r\ncharity, was the far-off face of Mary Antrim.  She smiled at him from the\r\nglory of heaven\xe2\x80\x94she brought the glory down with her to take him.  He\r\nbowed his head in submission and at the same moment another wave rolled\r\nover him.  Was it the quickening of joy to pain?  In the midst of his joy\r\nat any rate he felt his buried face grow hot as with some communicated\r\nknowledge that had the force of a reproach.  It suddenly made him\r\ncontrast that very rapture with the bliss he had refused to another.\r\nThis breath of the passion immortal was all that other had asked; the\r\ndescent of Mary Antrim opened his spirit with a great compunctious throb\r\nfor the descent of Acton Hague.  It was as if Stransom had read what her\r\neyes said to him.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he looked round in a despair that made him feel as if the\r\nsource of life were ebbing.  The church had been empty\xe2\x80\x94he was alone; but\r\nhe wanted to have something done, to make a last appeal.  This idea gave\r\nhim strength for an effort; he rose to his feet with a movement that made\r\nhim turn, supporting himself by the back of a bench.  Behind him was a\r\nprostrate figure, a figure he had seen before; a woman in deep mourning,\r\nbowed in grief or in prayer.  He had seen her in other days\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\ntime of his entrance there, and he now slightly wavered, looking at her\r\nagain till she seemed aware he had noticed her.  She raised her head and\r\nmet his eyes: the partner of his long worship had come back.  She looked\r\nacross at him an instant with a face wondering and scared; he saw he had\r\nmade her afraid.  Then quickly rising she came straight to him with both\r\nhands out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you _could_ come?  God sent you!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured with a happy smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very ill\xe2\x80\x94you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here,\xe2\x80\x9d she urged in anxious reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod sent me too, I think.  I was ill when I came, but the sight of you\r\ndoes wonders.\xe2\x80\x9d  He held her hands, which steadied and quickened him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve something to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d she tenderly pleaded; \xe2\x80\x9clet me tell you.  This afternoon,\r\nby a miracle, the sweetest of miracles, the sense of our difference left\r\nme.  I was out\xe2\x80\x94I was near, thinking, wandering alone, when, on the spot,\r\nsomething changed in my heart.  It\xe2\x80\x99s my confession\xe2\x80\x94there it is.  To come\r\nback, to come back on the instant\xe2\x80\x94the idea gave me wings.  It was as if I\r\nsuddenly saw something\xe2\x80\x94as if it all became possible.  I could come for\r\nwhat you yourself came for: that was enough.  So here I am.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not for\r\nmy own\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s over.  But I\xe2\x80\x99m here for _them_.\xe2\x80\x9d  And breathless,\r\ninfinitely relieved by her low precipitate explanation, she looked with\r\neyes that reflected all its splendour at the magnificence of their altar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re here for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Stransom said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re present to-night as\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve never been.  They speak for you\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x94in a passion of\r\nlight; they sing out like a choir of angels.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear what they\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x94they offer the very thing you asked of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk of it\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it; forget it!\xe2\x80\x9d  She spoke in hushed\r\nsupplication, and while the alarm deepened in her eyes she disengaged one\r\nof her hands and passed an arm round him to support him better, to help\r\nhim to sink into a seat.\r\n\r\nHe let himself go, resting on her; he dropped upon the bench and she fell\r\non her knees beside him, his own arm round her shoulder.  So he remained\r\nan instant, staring up at his shrine.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey say there\xe2\x80\x99s a gap in the\r\narray\xe2\x80\x94they say it\xe2\x80\x99s not full, complete.  Just one more,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\nsoftly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t that what you wanted?  Yes, one more, one more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no more\xe2\x80\x94no more!\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed, as with a quick new horror of it, under\r\nher breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one more,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, simply; \xe2\x80\x9cjust one!\xe2\x80\x9d  And with this his head\r\ndropped on her shoulder; she felt that in his weakness he had fainted.\r\nBut alone with him in the dusky church a great dread was on her of what\r\nmight still happen, for his face had the whiteness of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 642-0.txt or 642-0.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/6/4/642\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
