And that last\r\nword was the single word of the title.\r\n\r\nThose were the times of peace. Now that the moment of publication\r\napproaches I have been considering the discretion of altering the\r\ntitle-page. The word "Victory" the shining and tragic goal of noble\r\neffort, appeared too great, too august, to stand at the head of a mere\r\nnovel. There was also the possibility of falling under the suspicion of\r\ncommercial astuteness deceiving the public into the belief that the book\r\nhad something to do with war.\r\n\r\nOf that, however, I was not afraid very much. What influenced my\r\ndecision most were the obscure promptings of that pagan residuum of\r\nawe and wonder which lurks still at the bottom of our old humanity.\r\n"Victory" was the last word I had written in peace-time. It was the last\r\nliterary thought which had occurred to me before the doors of the Temple\r\nof Janus flying open with a crash shook the minds, the hearts, the\r\nconsciences of men all over the world. Such coincidence could not be\r\ntreated lightly. And I made up my mind to let the word stand, in the\r\nsame hopeful spirit in which some simple citizen of Old Rome would have\r\n"accepted the Omen."\r\n\r\nThe second point on which I wish to offer a remark is the existence (in\r\nthe novel) of a person named Schomberg.\r\n\r\nThat I believe him to be true goes without saying. I am not likely to\r\noffer pinchbeck wares to my public consciously. Schomberg is an old\r\nmember of my company. A very subordinate personage in Lord Jim as far\r\nback as the year 1899, he became notably active in a certain short story\r\nof mine published in 1902. Here he appears in a still larger part, true\r\nto life (I hope), but also true to himself. Only, in this instance, his\r\ndeeper passions come into play, and thus his grotesque psychology is\r\ncompleted at last.\r\n\r\nI don\'t pretend to say that this is the entire Teutonic psychology; but\r\nit is indubitably the psychology of a Teuton. My object in mentioning\r\nhim here is to bring out the fact that, far from being the incarnation\r\nof recent animosities, he is the creature of my old deep-seated, and, as\r\nit were, impartial conviction.\r\n\r\nJ. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR\'S NOTE\r\n\r\nOn approaching the task of writing this Note for Victory, the first\r\nthing I am conscious of is the actual nearness of the book, its nearness\r\nto me personally, to the vanished mood in which it was written, and to\r\nthe mixed feelings aroused by the critical notices the book obtained\r\nwhen first published almost exactly a year after the beginning of the\r\nwar. The writing of it was finished in 1914 long before the murder of an\r\nAustrian Archduke sounded the first note of warning for a world already\r\nfull of doubts and fears.\r\n\r\nThe contemporaneous very short Author\'s Note which is preserved in this\r\nedition bears sufficient witness to the feelings with which I consented\r\nto the publication of the book. The fact of the book having been\r\npublished in the United States early in the year made it difficult\r\nto delay its appearance in England any longer. It came out in the\r\nthirteenth month of the war, and my conscience was troubled by the awful\r\nincongruity of throwing this bit of imagined drama into the welter\r\nof reality, tragic enough in all conscience, but even more cruel than\r\ntragic and more inspiring than cruel. It seemed awfully presumptuous to\r\nthink there would be eyes to spare for those pages in a community which\r\nin the crash of the big guns and in the din of brave words expressing\r\nthe truth of an indomitable faith could not but feel the edge of a sharp\r\nknife at its throat.\r\n\r\nThe unchanging Man of history is wonderfully adaptable both by his power\r\nof endurance and in his capacity for detachment. The fact seems to\r\nbe that the play of his destiny is too great for his fears and too\r\nmysterious for his understanding. Were the trump of the Last Judgement\r\nto sound suddenly on a working day the musician at his piano would go on\r\nwith his performance of Beethoven\'s sonata and the cobbler at his\r\nstall stick to his last in undisturbed confidence in the virtues of the\r\nleather. And with perfect propriety. For what are we to let ourselves be\r\ndisturbed by an angel\'s vengeful music too mighty for our ears and too\r\nawful for our terrors? Thus it happens to us to be struck suddenly\r\nby the lightning of wrath. The reader will go on reading if the book\r\npleases him and the critic will go on criticizing with that faculty of\r\ndetachment born perhaps from a sense of infinite littleness and which is\r\nyet the only faculty that seems to assimilate man to the immortal gods.\r\n\r\nIt is only when the catastrophe matches the natural obscurity of our\r\nfate that even the best representative of the race is liable to lose his\r\ndetachment. It is very obvious that on the arrival of the gentlemanly\r\nMr. Jones, the single-minded Ricardo, and the faithful Pedro, Heyst, the\r\nman of universal detachment, loses his mental self-possession, that fine\r\nattitude before the universally irremediable which wears the name of\r\nstoicism. It is all a matter of proportion. There should have been a\r\nremedy for that sort of thing. And yet there is no remedy. Behind this\r\nminute instance of life\'s hazards Heyst sees the power of blind destiny.\r\nBesides, Heyst in his fine detachment had lost the habit of asserting\r\nhimself. I don\'t mean the courage of self-assertion, either moral or\r\nphysical, but the mere way of it, the trick of the thing, the readiness\r\nof mind and the turn of the hand that come without reflection and lead\r\nthe man to excellence in life, in art, in crime, in virtue, and, for the\r\nmatter of that, even in love. Thinking is the great enemy of perfection.\r\nThe habit of profound reflection, I am compelled to say, is the most\r\npernicious of all the habits formed by the civilized man.\r\n\r\nBut I wouldn\'t be suspected even remotely of making fun of Axel Heyst. I\r\nhave always liked him. The flesh-and-blood individual who stands\r\nbehind the infinitely more familiar figure of the book I remember as a\r\nmysterious Swede right enough. Whether he was a baron, too, I am not so\r\ncertain. He himself never laid claim to that distinction. His detachment\r\nwas too great to make any claims, big or small, on one\'s credulity. I\r\nwill not say where I met him because I fear to give my readers a\r\nwrong impression, since a marked incongruity between a man and his\r\nsurroundings is often a very misleading circumstance. We became very\r\nfriendly for a time, and I would not like to expose him to unpleasant\r\nsuspicions though, personally, I am sure he would have been indifferent\r\nto suspicions as he was indifferent to all the other disadvantages of\r\nlife. He was not the whole Heyst of course; he is only the physical and\r\nmoral foundation of my Heyst laid on the ground of a short acquaintance.\r\nThat it was short was certainly not my fault for he had charmed me by\r\nthe mere amenity of his detachment which, in this case, I cannot help\r\nthinking he had carried to excess. He went away from his rooms without\r\nleaving a trace. I wondered where he had gone to--but now I know.\r\nHe vanished from my ken only to drift into this adventure that,\r\nunavoidable, waited for him in a world which he persisted in looking\r\nupon as a malevolent shadow spinning in the sunlight. Often in the\r\ncourse of years an expressed sentiment, the particular sense of a phrase\r\nheard casually, would recall him to my mind so that I have fastened on\r\nto him many words heard on other men\'s lips and belonging to other men\'s\r\nless perfect, less pathetic moods.\r\n\r\nThe same observation will apply mutatis mutandis to Mr. Jones, who is\r\nbuilt on a much slenderer connection. Mr. Jones (or whatever his name\r\nwas) did not drift away from me. He turned his back on me and walked out\r\nof the room. It was in a little hotel in the island of St. Thomas in\r\nthe West Indies (in the year \'75) where we found him one hot afternoon\r\nextended on three chairs, all alone in the loud buzzing of flies to\r\nwhich his immobility and his cadaverous aspect gave a most gruesome\r\nsignificance. Our invasion must have displeased him because he got off\r\nthe chairs brusquely and walked out, leaving with me an indelibly weird\r\nimpression of his thin shanks. One of the men with me said that the\r\nfellow was the most desperate gambler he had ever come across. I said:\r\n"A professional sharper?" and got for an answer: "He\'s a terror; but I\r\nmust say that up to a certain point he will play fair. . . ." I wonder\r\nwhat the point was. I never saw him again because I believe he went\r\nstraight on board a mail-boat which left within the hour for other\r\nports of call in the direction of Aspinall. Mr. Jones\'s characteristic\r\ninsolence belongs to another man of a quite different type. I will say\r\nnothing as to the origins of his mentality because I don\'t intend to\r\nmake any damaging admissions.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the very same year Ricardo--the physical\r\nRicardo--was a fellow passenger of mine on board an extremely small and\r\nextremely dirty little schooner, during a four days\' passage between two\r\nplaces in the Gulf of Mexico whose names don\'t matter. For the most part\r\nhe lay on deck aft as it were at my feet, and raising himself from time\r\nto time on his elbow would talk about himself and go on talking, not\r\nexactly to me or even at me (he would not even look up but kept his\r\neyes fixed on the deck) but more as if communing in a low voice with\r\nhis familiar devil. Now and then he would give me a glance and make the\r\nhairs of his stiff little moustache stir quaintly. His eyes were green\r\nand every cat I see to this day reminds me of the exact contour of his\r\nface. What he was travelling for or what was his business in life he\r\nnever confided to me. Truth to say, the only passenger on board that\r\nschooner who could have talked openly about his activities and purposes\r\nwas a very snuffy and conversationally delightful friar, the superior\r\nof a convent, attended by a very young lay brother, of a particularly\r\nferocious countenance. We had with us also, lying prostrate in the dark\r\nand unspeakable cuddy of that schooner, an old Spanish gentleman, owner\r\nof much luggage and, as Ricardo assured me, very ill indeed. Ricardo\r\nseemed to be either a servant or the confidant of that aged and\r\ndistinguished-looking invalid, who early on the passage held a long\r\nmurmured conversation with the friar, and after that did nothing but\r\ngroan feebly, smoke cigarettes, and now and then call for Martin in a\r\nvoice full of pain. Then he who had become Ricardo in the book would go\r\nbelow into that beastly and noisome hole, remain there mysteriously,\r\nand coming up on deck again with a face on which nothing could be read,\r\nwould as likely as not resume for my edification the exposition of his\r\nmoral attitude towards life illustrated by striking particular instances\r\nof the most atrocious complexion. Did he mean to frighten me? Or seduce\r\nme? Or astonish me? Or arouse my admiration? All he did was to arouse my\r\namused incredulity. As scoundrels go he was far from being a bore.\r\nFor the rest my innocence was so great then that I could not take his\r\nphilosophy seriously. All the time he kept one ear turned to the cuddy\r\nin the manner of a devoted servant, but I had the idea that in some way\r\nor other he had imposed the connection on the invalid for some end of\r\nhis own. The reader, therefore, won\'t be surprised to hear that one\r\nmorning I was told without any particular emotion by the padrone of the\r\nschooner that the "rich man" down there was dead: He had died in the\r\nnight. I don\'t remember ever being so moved by the desolate end of a\r\ncomplete stranger. I looked down the skylight, and there was the devoted\r\nMartin busy cording cowhide trunks belonging to the deceased whose white\r\nbeard and hooked nose were the only parts I could make out in the dark\r\ndepths of a horrible stuffy bunk.\r\n\r\nAs it fell calm in the course of the afternoon and continued calm during\r\nall that night and the terrible, flaming day, the late "rich man" had\r\nto be thrown overboard at sunset, though as a matter of fact we were in\r\nsight of the low pestilential mangrove-lined coast of our destination.\r\nThe excellent Father Superior mentioned to me with an air of immense\r\ncommiseration: "The poor man has left a young daughter." Who was to look\r\nafter her I don\'t know, but I saw the devoted Martin taking the trunks\r\nashore with great care just before I landed myself. I would perhaps have\r\ntracked the ways of that man of immense sincerity for a little while,\r\nbut I had some of my own very pressing business to attend to, which in\r\nthe end got mixed up with an earthquake and so I had no time to give\r\nto Ricardo. The reader need not be told that I have not forgotten him,\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nMy contact with the faithful Pedro was much shorter and my observation\r\nof him was less complete but incomparably more anxious. It ended in a\r\nsudden inspiration to get out of his way. It was in a hovel of sticks\r\nand mats by the side of a path. As I went in there only to ask for a\r\nbottle of lemonade I have not to this day the slightest idea what in\r\nmy appearance or actions could have roused his terrible ire. It became\r\nmanifest to me less than two minutes after I had set eyes on him for the\r\nfirst time, and though immensely surprised of course I didn\'t stop\r\nto think it out I took the nearest short cut--through the wall. This\r\nbestial apparition and a certain enormous buck nigger encountered in\r\nHaiti only a couple of months afterwards, have fixed my conception of\r\nblind, furious, unreasoning rage, as manifested in the human animal, to\r\nthe end of my days. Of the nigger I used to dream for years afterwards.\r\nOf Pedro never. The impression was less vivid. I got away from him too\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me but natural that those three buried in a corner of my\r\nmemory should suddenly get out into the light of the world--so natural\r\nthat I offer no excuse for their existence, They were there, they had to\r\ncome out; and this is a sufficient excuse for a writer of tales who had\r\ntaken to his trade without preparation, or premeditation, and without\r\nany moral intention but that which pervades the whole scheme of this\r\nworld of senses.\r\n\r\nSince this Note is mostly concerned with personal contacts and the\r\norigins of the persons in the tale, I am bound also to speak of Lena,\r\nbecause if I were to leave her out it would look like a slight; and\r\nnothing would be further from my thoughts than putting a slight on Lena.\r\nIf of all the personages involved in the "mystery of Samburan" I have\r\nlived longest with Heyst (or with him I call Heyst) it was at her, whom\r\nI call Lena, that I have looked the longest and with a most sustained\r\nattention. This attention originated in idleness for which I have a\r\nnatural talent. One evening I wandered into a cafe, in a town not of the\r\ntropics but of the South of France. It was filled with tobacco smoke,\r\nthe hum of voices, the rattling of dominoes, and the sounds of strident\r\nmusic. The orchestra was rather smaller than the one that performed\r\nat Schomberg\'s hotel, had the air more of a family party than of an\r\nenlisted band, and, I must confess, seemed rather more respectable than\r\nthe Zangiacomo musical enterprise. It was less pretentious also, more\r\nhomely and familiar, so to speak, insomuch that in the intervals when\r\nall the performers left the platform one of them went amongst the\r\nmarble tables collecting offerings of sous and francs in a battered\r\ntin receptacle recalling the shape of a sauceboat. It was a girl.\r\nHer detachment from her task seems to me now to have equalled or even\r\nsurpassed Heyst\'s aloofness from all the mental degradations to which\r\na man\'s intelligence is exposed in its way through life. Silent and\r\nwide-eyed she went from table to table with the air of a sleep-walker\r\nand with no other sound but the slight rattle of the coins to attract\r\nattention. It was long after the sea-chapter of my life had been closed\r\nbut it is difficult to discard completely the characteristics of half\r\na lifetime, and it was in something of the Jack-ashore spirit that\r\nI dropped a five-franc piece into the sauceboat; whereupon the\r\nsleep-walker turned her head to gaze at me and said "Merci, Monsieur"\r\nin a tone in which there was no gratitude but only surprise. I must have\r\nbeen idle indeed to take the trouble to remark on such slight evidence\r\nthat the voice was very charming and when the performers resumed\r\ntheir seats I shifted my position slightly in order not to have that\r\nparticular performer hidden from me by the little man with the beard who\r\nconducted, and who might for all I know have been her father, but whose\r\nreal mission in life was to be a model for the Zangiacomo of Victory.\r\nHaving got a clear line of sight I naturally (being idle) continued to\r\nlook at the girl through all the second part of the programme. The shape\r\nof her dark head inclined over the violin was fascinating, and, while\r\nresting between the pieces of that interminable programme she was, in\r\nher white dress and with her brown hands reposing in her lap, the very\r\nimage of dreamy innocence. The mature, bad-tempered woman at the\r\npiano might have been her mother, though there was not the slightest\r\nresemblance between them. All I am certain of in their personal relation\r\nto each other is that cruel pinch on the upper part of the arm. That I\r\nam sure I have seen! There could be no mistake. I was in too idle a mood\r\nto imagine such a gratuitous barbarity. It may have been playfulness,\r\nyet the girl jumped up as if she had been stung by a wasp. It may have\r\nbeen playfulness. Yet I saw plainly poor "dreamy innocence" rub gently\r\nthe affected place as she filed off with the other performers down the\r\nmiddle aisle between the marble tables in the uproar of voices, the\r\nrattling of dominoes through a blue atmosphere of tobacco smoke. I\r\nbelieve that those people left the town next day.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps they had only migrated to the other big cafe, on the other\r\nside of the Place de la Comedie. It is very possible. I did not go\r\nacross to find out. It was my perfect idleness that had invested the\r\ngirl with a peculiar charm, and I did not want to destroy it by\r\nany superfluous exertion. The receptivity of my indolence made the\r\nimpression so permanent that when the moment came for her meeting with\r\nHeyst I felt that she would be heroically equal to every demand of the\r\nrisky and uncertain future. I was so convinced of it that I let her go\r\nwith Heyst, I won\'t say without a pang but certainly without misgivings.\r\nAnd in view of her triumphant end what more could I have done for her\r\nrehabilitation and her happiness?\r\n\r\n1920. J. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORY: AN ISLAND TALE PART ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\nThere is, as every schoolboy knows in this scientific age, a very\r\nclose chemical relation between coal and diamonds. It is the reason, I\r\nbelieve, why some people allude to coal as "black diamonds." Both these\r\ncommodities represent wealth; but coal is a much less portable form\r\nof property. There is, from that point of view, a deplorable lack of\r\nconcentration in coal. Now, if a coal-mine could be put into one\'s\r\nwaistcoat pocket--but it can\'t! At the same time, there is a fascination\r\nin coal, the supreme commodity of the age in which we are camped like\r\nbewildered travellers in a garish, unrestful hotel. And I suppose\r\nthose two considerations, the practical and the mystical, prevented\r\nHeyst--Axel Heyst--from going away.\r\n\r\nThe Tropical Belt Coal Company went into liquidation. The world of\r\nfinance is a mysterious world in which, incredible as the fact may\r\nappear, evaporation precedes liquidation. First the capital evaporates,\r\nand then the company goes into liquidation. These are very unnatural\r\nphysics, but they account for the persistent inertia of Heyst, at which\r\nwe "out there" used to laugh among ourselves--but not inimically. An\r\ninert body can do no harm to anyone, provokes no hostility, is scarcely\r\nworth derision. It may, indeed, be in the way sometimes; but this could\r\nnot be said of Axel Heyst. He was out of everybody\'s way, as if he\r\nwere perched on the highest peak of the Himalayas, and in a sense as\r\nconspicuous. Everyone in that part of the world knew of him, dwelling on\r\nhis little island. An island is but the top of a mountain. Axel Heyst,\r\nperched on it immovably, was surrounded, instead of the imponderable\r\nstormy and transparent ocean of air merging into infinity, by a tepid,\r\nshallow sea; a passionless offshoot of the great waters which embrace\r\nthe continents of this globe. His most frequent visitors were shadows,\r\nthe shadows of clouds, relieving the monotony of the inanimate, brooding\r\nsunshine of the tropics. His nearest neighbour--I am speaking now of\r\nthings showing some sort of animation--was an indolent volcano which\r\nsmoked faintly all day with its head just above the northern horizon,\r\nand at night levelled at him, from amongst the clear stars, a dull red\r\nglow, expanding and collapsing spasmodically like the end of a gigantic\r\ncigar puffed at intermittently in the dark. Axel Heyst was also a\r\nsmoker; and when he lounged out on his veranda with his cheroot, the\r\nlast thing before going to bed, he made in the night the same sort of\r\nglow and of the same size as that other one so many miles away.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, the volcano was company to him in the shades of the\r\nnight--which were often too thick, one would think, to let a breath of\r\nair through. There was seldom enough wind to blow a feather along. On\r\nmost evenings of the year Heyst could have sat outside with a naked\r\ncandle to read one of the books left him by his late father. It was not\r\na mean store. But he never did that. Afraid of mosquitoes, very likely.\r\nNeither was he ever tempted by the silence to address any casual remarks\r\nto the companion glow of the volcano. He was not mad. Queer chap--yes,\r\nthat may have been said, and in fact was said; but there is a tremendous\r\ndifference between the two, you will allow.\r\n\r\nOn the nights of full moon the silence around Samburan--the "Round\r\nIsland" of the charts--was dazzling; and in the flood of cold light\r\nHeyst could see his immediate surroundings, which had the aspect of\r\nan abandoned settlement invaded by the jungle: vague roofs above low\r\nvegetation, broken shadows of bamboo fences in the sheen of long grass,\r\nsomething like an overgrown bit of road slanting among ragged thickets\r\ntowards the shore only a couple of hundred yards away, with a black\r\njetty and a mound of some sort, quite inky on its unlighted side. But\r\nthe most conspicuous object was a gigantic blackboard raised on two\r\nposts and presenting to Heyst, when the moon got over that side, the\r\nwhite letters "T. B. C. Co." in a row at least two feet high. These were\r\nthe initials of the Tropical Belt Coal Company, his employers--his late\r\nemployers, to be precise.\r\n\r\nAccording to the unnatural mysteries of the financial world, the T. B.\r\nC. Company\'s capital having evaporated in the course of two years, the\r\ncompany went into liquidation--forced, I believe, not voluntary. There\r\nwas nothing forcible in the process, however. It was slow; and while the\r\nliquidation--in London and Amsterdam--pursued its languid course, Axel\r\nHeyst, styled in the prospectus "manager in the tropics," remained at\r\nhis post on Samburan, the No. 1 coaling-station of the company.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not merely a coaling-station. There was a coal-mine there,\r\nwith an outcrop in the hillside less than five hundred yards from the\r\nrickety wharf and the imposing blackboard. The company\'s object had been\r\nto get hold of all the outcrops on tropical islands and exploit them\r\nlocally. And, Lord knows, there were any amount of outcrops. It was\r\nHeyst who had located most of them in this part of the tropical belt\r\nduring his rather aimless wanderings, and being a ready letter-writer\r\nhad written pages and pages about them to his friends in Europe. At\r\nleast, so it was said.\r\n\r\nWe doubted whether he had any visions of wealth--for himself, at any\r\nrate. What he seemed mostly concerned for was the "stride forward,"\r\nas he expressed it, in the general organization of the universe,\r\napparently. He was heard by more than a hundred persons in the islands\r\ntalking of a "great stride forward for these regions." The convinced\r\nwave of the hand which accompanied the phrase suggested tropical\r\ndistances being impelled onward. In connection with the finished\r\ncourtesy of his manner, it was persuasive, or at any rate silencing--for\r\na time, at least. Nobody cared to argue with him when he talked in this\r\nstrain. His earnestness could do no harm to anybody. There was no danger\r\nof anyone taking seriously his dream of tropical coal, so what was the\r\nuse of hurting his feelings?\r\n\r\nThus reasoned men in reputable business offices where he had his entree\r\nas a person who came out East with letters of introduction--and modest\r\nletters of credit, too--some years before these coal-outcrops began to\r\ncrop up in his playfully courteous talk. From the first there was\r\nsome difficulty in making him out. He was not a traveller. A traveller\r\narrives and departs, goes on somewhere. Heyst did not depart. I met a\r\nman once--the manager of the branch of the Oriental Banking Corporation\r\nin Malacca--to whom Heyst exclaimed, in no connection with anything in\r\nparticular (it was in the billiard-room of the club):\r\n\r\n"I am enchanted with these islands!"\r\n\r\nHe shot it out suddenly, a propos des bottes, as the French say, and\r\nwhile chalking his cue. And perhaps it was some sort of enchantment.\r\nThere are more spells than your commonplace magicians ever dreamed of.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, a circle with a radius of eight hundred miles drawn\r\nround a point in North Borneo was in Heyst\'s case a magic circle. It\r\njust touched Manila, and he had been seen there. It just touched Saigon,\r\nand he was likewise seen there once. Perhaps these were his attempts to\r\nbreak out. If so, they were failures. The enchantment must have been\r\nan unbreakable one. The manager--the man who heard the exclamation--had\r\nbeen so impressed by the tone, fervour, rapture, what you will, or\r\nperhaps by the incongruity of it that he had related the experience to\r\nmore than one person.\r\n\r\n"Queer chap, that Swede," was his only comment; but this is the origin\r\nof the name "Enchanted Heyst" which some fellows fastened on our man.\r\n\r\nHe also had other names. In his early years, long before he got so\r\nbecomingly bald on the top, he went to present a letter of introduction\r\nto Mr. Tesman of Tesman Brothers, a Sourabaya firm--tip-top house. Well,\r\nMr. Tesman was a kindly, benevolent old gentleman. He did not know what\r\nto make of that caller. After telling him that they wished to render his\r\nstay among the islands as pleasant as possible, and that they were\r\nready to assist him in his plans, and so on, and after receiving Heyst\'s\r\nthanks--you know the usual kind of conversation--he proceeded to query\r\nin a slow, paternal tone:\r\n\r\n"And you are interested in--?"\r\n\r\n"Facts," broke in Heyst in his courtly voice. "There\'s nothing worth\r\nknowing but facts. Hard facts! Facts alone, Mr. Tesman."\r\n\r\nI don\'t know if old Tesman agreed with him or not, but he must have\r\nspoken about it, because, for a time, our man got the name of "Hard\r\nFacts." He had the singular good fortune that his sayings stuck to him\r\nand became part of his name. Thereafter he mooned about the Java Sea in\r\nsome of the Tesmans\' trading schooners, and then vanished, on board an\r\nArab ship, in the direction of New Guinea. He remained so long in that\r\noutlying part of his enchanted circle that he was nearly forgotten\r\nbefore he swam into view again in a native proa full of Goram vagabonds,\r\nburnt black by the sun, very lean, his hair much thinned, and a\r\nportfolio of sketches under his arm. He showed these willingly, but\r\nwas very reserved as to anything else. He had had an "amusing time," he\r\nsaid. A man who will go to New Guinea for fun--well!\r\n\r\nLater, years afterwards, when the last vestiges of youth had gone off\r\nhis face and all the hair off the top of his head, and his red-gold\r\npair of horizontal moustaches had grown to really noble proportions,\r\na certain disreputable white man fastened upon him an epithet. Putting\r\ndown with a shaking hand a long glass emptied of its contents--paid\r\nfor by Heyst--he said, with that deliberate sagacity which no mere\r\nwater-drinker ever attained:\r\n\r\n"Heyst\'s a puffect g\'n\'lman. Puffect! But he\'s a ut-uto-utopist."\r\n\r\nHeyst had just gone out of the place of public refreshment where this\r\npronouncement was voiced. Utopist, eh? Upon my word, the only thing\r\nI heard him say which might have had a bearing on the point was his\r\ninvitation to old McNab himself. Turning with that finished courtesy of\r\nattitude, movement voice, which was his obvious characteristic, he had\r\nsaid with delicate playfulness:\r\n\r\n"Come along and quench your thirst with us, Mr. McNab!"\r\n\r\nPerhaps that was it. A man who could propose, even playfully, to quench\r\nold McNab\'s thirst must have been a utopist, a pursuer of chimeras; for\r\nof downright irony Heyst was not prodigal. And, may be, this was the\r\nreason why he was generally liked. At that epoch in his life, in the\r\nfulness of his physical development, of a broad, martial presence, with\r\nhis bald head and long moustaches, he resembled the portraits of Charles\r\nXII., of adventurous memory. However, there was no reason to think that\r\nHeyst was in any way a fighting man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Heyst became associated with Morrison on\r\nterms about which people were in doubt. Some said he was a partner,\r\nothers said he was a sort of paying guest, but the real truth of the\r\nmatter was more complex. One day Heyst turned up in Timor. Why in Timor,\r\nof all places in the world, no one knows. Well, he was mooning about\r\nDelli, that highly pestilential place, possibly in search of some\r\nundiscovered facts, when he came in the street upon Morrison, who, in\r\nhis way, was also an "enchanted" man. When you spoke to Morrison of\r\ngoing home--he was from Dorsetshire--he shuddered. He said it was dark\r\nand wet there; that it was like living with your head and shoulders in\r\na moist gunny-bag. That was only his exaggerated style of talking.\r\nMorrison was "one of us." He was owner and master of the Capricorn,\r\ntrading brig, and was understood to be doing well with her, except for\r\nthe drawback of too much altruism. He was the dearly beloved friend of a\r\nquantity of God-forsaken villages up dark creeks and obscure bays, where\r\nhe traded for produce. He would often sail, through awfully dangerous\r\nchannels up to some miserable settlement, only to find a very hungry\r\npopulation clamorous for rice, and without so much "produce" between\r\nthem as would have filled Morrison\'s suitcase. Amid general rejoicings,\r\nhe would land the rice all the same, explain to the people that it was\r\nan advance, that they were in debt to him now; would preach to them\r\nenergy and industry, and make an elaborate note in a pocket-diary which\r\nhe always carried; and this would be the end of that transaction.\r\nI don\'t know if Morrison thought so, but the villagers had no doubt\r\nwhatever about it. Whenever a coast village sighted the brig it would\r\nbegin to beat all its gongs and hoist all its streamers, and all its\r\ngirls would put flowers in their hair and the crowd would line the river\r\nbank, and Morrison would beam and glitter at all this excitement through\r\nhis single eyeglass with an air of intense gratification. He was tall\r\nand lantern-jawed, and clean-shaven, and looked like a barrister who had\r\nthrown his wig to the dogs.\r\n\r\nWe used to remonstrate with him:\r\n\r\n"You will never see any of your advances if you go on like this,\r\nMorrison."\r\n\r\nHe would put on a knowing air.\r\n\r\n"I shall squeeze them yet some day--never you fear. And that reminds\r\nme"--pulling out his inseparable pocketbook--"there\'s that So-and-So\r\nvillage. They are pretty well off again; I may just as well squeeze them\r\nto begin with."\r\n\r\nHe would make a ferocious entry in the pocketbook.\r\n\r\nMemo: Squeeze the So-and-So village at the first time of calling.\r\n\r\nThen he would stick the pencil back and snap the elastic on with\r\ninflexible finality; but he never began the squeezing. Some men grumbled\r\nat him. He was spoiling the trade. Well, perhaps to a certain extent;\r\nnot much. Most of the places he traded with were unknown not only to\r\ngeography but also to the traders\' special lore which is transmitted by\r\nword of mouth, without ostentation, and forms the stock of mysterious\r\nlocal knowledge. It was hinted also that Morrison had a wife in each and\r\nevery one of them, but the majority of us repulsed these innuendoes\r\nwith indignation. He was a true humanitarian and rather ascetic than\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen Heyst met him in Delli, Morrison was walking along the street,\r\nhis eyeglass tossed over his shoulder, his head down, with the hopeless\r\naspect of those hardened tramps one sees on our roads trudging from\r\nworkhouse to workhouse. Being hailed on the street he looked up with a\r\nwild worried expression. He was really in trouble. He had come the week\r\nbefore into Delli and the Portuguese authorities, on some pretence\r\nof irregularity in his papers, had inflicted a fine upon him and had\r\narrested his brig.\r\n\r\nMorrison never had any spare cash in hand. With his system of trading\r\nit would have been strange if he had; and all these debts entered in\r\nthe pocketbook weren\'t good enough to raise a millrei on--let alone a\r\nshilling. The Portuguese officials begged him not to distress himself.\r\nThey gave him a week\'s grace, and then proposed to sell the brig at\r\nauction. This meant ruin for Morrison; and when Heyst hailed him across\r\nthe street in his usual courtly tone, the week was nearly out.\r\n\r\nHeyst crossed over, and said with a slight bow, and in the manner of a\r\nprince addressing another prince on a private occasion:\r\n\r\n"What an unexpected pleasure. Would you have any objection to drink\r\nsomething with me in that infamous wine-shop over there? The sun is\r\nreally too strong to talk in the street."\r\n\r\nThe haggard Morrison followed obediently into a sombre, cool hovel which\r\nhe would have distained to enter at any other time. He was distracted.\r\nHe did not know what he was doing. You could have led him over the edge\r\nof a precipice just as easily as into that wine-shop. He sat down like\r\nan automaton. He was speechless, but he saw a glass full of rough red\r\nwine before him, and emptied it. Heyst meantime, politely watchful, had\r\ntaken a seat opposite.\r\n\r\n"You are in for a bout of fever, I fear," he said sympathetically.\r\n\r\nPoor Morrison\'s tongue was loosened at that.\r\n\r\n"Fever!" he cried. "Give me fever. Give me plague. They are diseases.\r\nOne gets over them. But I am being murdered. I am being murdered by the\r\nPortuguese. The gang here downed me at last among them. I am to have my\r\nthroat cut the day after tomorrow."\r\n\r\nIn the face of this passion Heyst made, with his eyebrows, a\r\nslight motion of surprise which would not have been misplaced in a\r\ndrawing-room. Morrison\'s despairing reserve had broken down. He had been\r\nwandering with a dry throat all over that miserable town of mud hovels,\r\nsilent, with no soul to turn to in his distress, and positively\r\nmaddened by his thoughts; and suddenly he had stumbled on a white man,\r\nfiguratively and actually white--for Morrison refused to accept the\r\nracial whiteness of the Portuguese officials. He let himself go for the\r\nmere relief of violent speech, his elbows planted on the table, his\r\neyes blood-shot, his voice nearly gone, the brim of his round pith hat\r\nshading an unshaven, livid face. His white clothes, which he had not\r\ntaken off for three days, were dingy. He had already gone to the bad,\r\npast redemption. The sight was shocking to Heyst; but he let nothing\r\nof it appear in his bearing, concealing his impression under that\r\nconsummate good-society manner of his. Polite attention, what\'s due from\r\none gentleman listening to another, was what he showed; and, as usual,\r\nit was catching; so that Morrison pulled himself together and finished\r\nhis narrative in a conversational tone, with a man-of-the-world air.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a villainous plot. Unluckily, one is helpless. That scoundrel\r\nCousinho--Andreas, you know--has been coveting the brig for years.\r\nNaturally, I would never sell. She is not only my livelihood; she\'s my\r\nlife. So he has hatched this pretty little plot with the chief of the\r\ncustoms. The sale, of course, will be a farce. There\'s no one here to\r\nbid. He will get the brig for a song--no, not even that--a line of a\r\nsong. You have been some years now in the islands, Heyst. You know us\r\nall; you have seen how we live. Now you shall have the opportunity\r\nto see how some of us end; for it is the end, for me. I can\'t deceive\r\nmyself any longer. You see it--don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nMorrison had pulled himself together, but one felt the snapping strain\r\non his recovered self-possession. Heyst was beginning to say that\r\nhe "could very well see all the bearings of this unfortunate--" when\r\nMorrison interrupted him jerkily.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I don\'t know why I have been telling you all this. I\r\nsuppose seeing a thoroughly white man made it impossible to keep my\r\ntrouble to myself. Words can\'t do it justice; but since I\'ve told you so\r\nmuch I may as well tell you more. Listen. This morning on board, in my\r\ncabin I went down on my knees and prayed for help. I went down on my\r\nknees!"\r\n\r\n"You are a believer, Morrison?" asked Heyst with a distinct note of\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n"Surely I am not an infidel."\r\n\r\nMorrison was swiftly reproachful in his answer, and there came a pause,\r\nMorrison perhaps interrogating his conscience, and Heyst preserving a\r\nmien of unperturbed, polite interest.\r\n\r\n"I prayed like a child, of course. I believe in children praying--well,\r\nwomen, too, but I rather think God expects men to be more self-reliant.\r\nI don\'t hold with a man everlastingly bothering the Almighty with his\r\nsilly troubles. It seems such cheek. Anyhow, this morning I--I have\r\nnever done any harm to any God\'s creature knowingly--I prayed. A sudden\r\nimpulse--I went flop on my knees; so you may judge--"\r\n\r\nThey were gazing earnestly into each other\'s eyes. Poor Morrison added,\r\nas a discouraging afterthought:\r\n\r\n"Only this is such a God-forsaken spot."\r\n\r\nHeyst inquired with a delicate intonation whether he might know the\r\namount for which the brig was seized.\r\n\r\nMorrison suppressed an oath, and named curtly a sum which was in itself\r\nso insignificant that any other person than Heyst would have exclaimed\r\nat it. And even Heyst could hardly keep incredulity out of his politely\r\nmodulated voice as he asked if it was a fact that Morrison had not that\r\namount in hand.\r\n\r\nMorrison hadn\'t. He had only a little English gold, a few sovereigns, on\r\nboard. He had left all his spare cash with the Tesmans, in Samarang, to\r\nmeet certain bills which would fall due while he was away on his cruise.\r\nAnyhow, that money would not have been any more good to him than if it\r\nhad been in the innermost depths of the infernal regions. He said all\r\nthis brusquely. He looked with sudden disfavour at that noble forehead,\r\nat those great martial moustaches, at the tired eyes of the man sitting\r\nopposite him. Who the devil was he? What was he, Morrison, doing there,\r\ntalking like this? Morrison knew no more of Heyst than the rest of us\r\ntrading in the Archipelago did. Had the Swede suddenly risen and hit\r\nhim on the nose, he could not have been taken more aback than when this\r\nstranger, this nondescript wanderer, said with a little bow across the\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n"Oh! If that\'s the case I would be very happy if you\'d allow me to be of\r\nuse!"\r\n\r\nMorrison didn\'t understand. This was one of those things that don\'t\r\nhappen--unheard of things. He had no real inkling of what it meant, till\r\nHeyst said definitely:\r\n\r\n"I can lend you the amount."\r\n\r\n"You have the money?" whispered Morrison. "Do you mean here, in your\r\npocket?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, on me. Glad to be of use."\r\n\r\nMorrison, staring open-mouthed, groped over his shoulder for the cord of\r\nthe eyeglass hanging down his back. When he found it, he stuck it in his\r\neye hastily. It was as if he expected Heyst\'s usual white suit of the\r\ntropics to change into a shining garment, flowing down to his toes,\r\nand a pair of great dazzling wings to sprout out on the Swede\'s\r\nshoulders--and didn\'t want to miss a single detail of the\r\ntransformation. But if Heyst was an angel from on high, sent in answer\r\nto prayer, he did not betray his heavenly origin by outward signs.\r\nSo, instead of going on his knees, as he felt inclined to do, Morrison\r\nstretched out his hand, which Heyst grasped with formal alacrity and a\r\npolite murmur in which "Trifle--delighted--of service," could just be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\n"Miracles do happen," thought the awestruck Morrison. To him, as to\r\nall of us in the Islands, this wandering Heyst, who didn\'t toil or spin\r\nvisibly, seemed the very last person to be the agent of Providence in\r\nan affair concerned with money. The fact of his turning up in Timor or\r\nanywhere else was no more wonderful than the settling of a sparrow on\r\none\'s window-sill at any given moment. But that he should carry a sum of\r\nmoney in his pocket seemed somehow inconceivable.\r\n\r\nSo inconceivable that as they were trudging together through the sand\r\nof the roadway to the custom-house--another mud hovel--to pay the\r\nfine, Morrison broke into a cold sweat, stopped short, and exclaimed in\r\nfaltering accents:\r\n\r\n"I say! You aren\'t joking, Heyst?"\r\n\r\n"Joking!" Heyst\'s blue eyes went hard as he turned them on the\r\ndiscomposed Morrison. "In what way, may I ask?" he continued with\r\naustere politeness.\r\n\r\nMorrison was abashed.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, Heyst. You must have been sent by God in answer to my\r\nprayer. But I have been nearly off my chump for three days with worry;\r\nand it suddenly struck me: \'What if it\'s the Devil who has sent him?\'"\r\n\r\n"I have no connection with the supernatural," said Heyst graciously,\r\nmoving on. "Nobody has sent me. I just happened along."\r\n\r\n"I know better," contradicted Morrison. "I may be unworthy, but I have\r\nbeen heard. I know it. I feel it. For why should you offer--"\r\n\r\nHeyst inclined his head, as from respect for a conviction in which he\r\ncould not share. But he stuck to his point by muttering that in the\r\npresence of an odious fact like this, it was natural--\r\n\r\nLater in the day, the fine paid, and the two of them on board the brig,\r\nfrom which the guard had been removed, Morrison who, besides, being a\r\ngentleman was also an honest fellow began to talk about repayment. He\r\nknew very well his inability to lay by any sum of money. It was partly\r\nthe fault of circumstances and partly of his temperament; and it would\r\nhave been very difficult to apportion the responsibility between the\r\ntwo. Even Morrison himself could not say, while confessing to the fact.\r\nWith a worried air he ascribed it to fatality:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how it is that I\'ve never been able to save. It\'s some\r\nsort of curse. There\'s always a bill or two to meet."\r\n\r\nHe plunged his hand into his pocket for the famous notebook so well\r\nknown in the islands, the fetish of his hopes, and fluttered the pages\r\nfeverishly.\r\n\r\n"And yet--look," he went on. "There it is--more than five thousand\r\ndollars owing. Surely that\'s something."\r\n\r\nHe ceased suddenly. Heyst, who had been all the time trying to look\r\nas unconcerned as he could, made reassuring noises in his throat.\r\nBut Morrison was not only honest. He was honourable, too; and on this\r\nstressful day, before this amazing emissary of Providence and in the\r\nrevulsion of his feelings, he made his great renunciation. He cast off\r\nthe abiding illusion of his existence.\r\n\r\n"No. No. They are not good. I\'ll never be able to squeeze them. Never.\r\nI\'ve been saying for years I would, but I give it up. I never really\r\nbelieved I could. Don\'t reckon on that, Heyst. I have robbed you."\r\n\r\nPoor Morrison actually laid his head on the cabin table, and remained\r\nin that crushed attitude while Heyst talked to him soothingly with the\r\nutmost courtesy. The Swede was as much distressed as Morrison; for he\r\nunderstood the other\'s feelings perfectly. No decent feeling was ever\r\nscorned by Heyst. But he was incapable of outward cordiality of manner,\r\nand he felt acutely his defect. Consummate politeness is not the right\r\ntonic for an emotional collapse. They must have had, both of them, a\r\nfairly painful time of it in the cabin of the brig. In the end Morrison,\r\ncasting desperately for an idea in the blackness of his despondency,\r\nhit upon the notion of inviting Heyst to travel with him in his brig and\r\nhave a share in his trading ventures up to the amount of his loan.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of Heyst\'s unattached, floating existence that he\r\nwas in a position to accept this proposal. There is no reason to think\r\nthat he wanted particularly just then to go poking aboard the brig into\r\nall the holes and corners of the Archipelago where Morrison picked up\r\nmost of his trade. Far from it; but he would have consented to almost\r\nany arrangement in order to put an end to the harrowing scene in the\r\ncabin. There was at once a great transformation act: Morrison raising\r\nhis diminished head, and sticking the glass in his eye to look\r\naffectionately at Heyst, a bottle being uncorked, and so on. It was\r\nagreed that nothing should be said to anyone of this transaction.\r\nMorrison, you understand, was not proud of the episode, and he was\r\nafraid of being unmercifully chaffed.\r\n\r\n"An old bird like me! To let myself be trapped by those damned\r\nPortuguese rascals! I should never hear the last of it. We must keep it\r\ndark."\r\n\r\nFrom quite other motives, among which his native delicacy was the\r\nprincipal, Heyst was even more anxious to bind himself to silence. A\r\ngentleman would naturally shrink from the part of heavenly messenger\r\nthat Morrison would force upon him. It made Heyst uncomfortable, as it\r\nwas. And perhaps he did not care that it should be known that he had\r\nsome means, whatever they might have been--sufficient, at any rate, to\r\nenable him to lend money to people. These two had a duet down there,\r\nlike conspirators in a comic opera, of "Sh--ssh, shssh! Secrecy!\r\nSecrecy!" It must have been funny, because they were very serious about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd for a time the conspiracy was successful in so far that we all\r\nconcluded that Heyst was boarding with the good-natured--some said:\r\nsponging on the imbecile--Morrison, in his brig. But you know how it\r\nis with all such mysteries. There is always a leak somewhere. Morrison\r\nhimself, not a perfect vessel by any means, was bursting with gratitude,\r\nand under the stress he must have let out something vague--enough to\r\ngive the island gossip a chance. And you know how kindly the world is\r\nin its comments on what it does not understand. A rumour sprang out that\r\nHeyst, having obtained some mysterious hold on Morrison, had fastened\r\nhimself on him and was sucking him dry. Those who had traced these\r\nmutters back to their origin were very careful not to believe them. The\r\noriginator, it seems, was a certain Schomberg, a big, manly, bearded\r\ncreature of the Teutonic persuasion, with an ungovernable tongue which\r\nsurely must have worked on a pivot. Whether he was a Lieutenant of the\r\nReserve, as he declared, I don\'t know. Out there he was by profession a\r\nhotel-keeper, first in Bangkok, then somewhere else, and ultimately in\r\nSourabaya. He dragged after him up and down that section of the tropical\r\nbelt a silent, frightened, little woman with long ringlets, who smiled\r\nat one stupidly, showing a blue tooth. I don\'t know why so many of us\r\npatronized his various establishments. He was a noxious ass, and he\r\nsatisfied his lust for silly gossip at the cost of his customers. It\r\nwas he who, one evening, as Morrison and Heyst went past the hotel--they\r\nwere not his regular patrons--whispered mysteriously to the mixed\r\ncompany assembled on the veranda:\r\n\r\n"The spider and the fly just gone by, gentlemen." Then, very important\r\nand confidential, his thick paw at the side of his mouth: "We are among\r\nourselves; well, gentlemen, all I can say is, don\'t you ever get mixed\r\nup with that Swede. Don\'t you ever get caught in his web."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nHuman nature being what it is, having a silly side to it as well as\r\na mean side, there were not a few who pretended to be indignant on no\r\nbetter authority than a general propensity to believe every evil report;\r\nand a good many others who found it simply funny to call Heyst the\r\nSpider--behind his back, of course. He was as serenely unconscious of\r\nthis as of his several other nicknames. But soon people found other\r\nthings to say of Heyst; not long afterwards he came very much to the\r\nfore in larger affairs. He blossomed out into something definite. He\r\nfilled the public eye as the manager on the spot of the Tropical Belt\r\nCoal Company with offices in London and Amsterdam, and other things\r\nabout it that sounded and looked grandiose. The offices in the two\r\ncapitals may have consisted--and probably did--of one room in each;\r\nbut at that distance, out East there, all this had an air. We were more\r\npuzzled than dazzled, it is true; but even the most sober-minded among\r\nus began to think that there was something in it. The Tesmans appointed\r\nagents, a contract for government mail-boats secured, the era of steam\r\nbeginning for the islands--a great stride forward--Heyst\'s stride!\r\n\r\nAnd all this sprang from the meeting of the cornered Morrison and of the\r\nwandering Heyst, which may or may not have been the direct outcome of a\r\nprayer. Morrison was not an imbecile, but he seemed to have got himself\r\ninto a state of remarkable haziness as to his exact position towards\r\nHeyst. For, if Heyst had been sent with money in his pocket by a direct\r\ndecree of the Almighty in answer to Morrison\'s prayer then there was no\r\nreason for special gratitude, since obviously he could not help himself.\r\nBut Morrison believed both, in the efficacy of prayer and in the\r\ninfinite goodness of Heyst. He thanked God with awed sincerity for his\r\nmercy, and could not thank Heyst enough for the service rendered as\r\nbetween man and man. In this (highly creditable) tangle of strong\r\nfeelings Morrison\'s gratitude insisted on Heyst\'s partnership in the\r\ngreat discovery. Ultimately we heard that Morrison had gone home through\r\nthe Suez Canal in order to push the magnificent coal idea personally\r\nin London. He parted from his brig and disappeared from our ken; but\r\nwe heard that he had written a letter or letters to Heyst, saying that\r\nLondon was cold and gloomy; that he did not like either the men or\r\nthings, that he was "as lonely as a crow in a strange country." In\r\ntruth, he pined after the Capricorn--I don\'t mean only the tropic; I\r\nmean the ship too. Finally he went into Dorsetshire to see his people,\r\ncaught a bad cold, and died with extraordinary precipitation in the\r\nbosom of his appalled family. Whether his exertions in the City of\r\nLondon had enfeebled his vitality I don\'t know; but I believe it was\r\nthis visit which put life into the coal idea. Be it as it may, the\r\nTropical Belt Coal Company was born very shortly after Morrison,\r\nthe victim of gratitude and his native climate, had gone to join his\r\nforefathers in a Dorsetshire churchyard.\r\n\r\nHeyst was immensely shocked. He got the news in the Moluccas through the\r\nTesmans, and then disappeared for a time. It appears that he stayed with\r\na Dutch government doctor in Amboyna, a friend of his who looked after\r\nhim for a bit in his bungalow. He became visible again rather suddenly,\r\nhis eyes sunk in his head, and with a sort of guarded attitude, as if\r\nafraid someone would reproach him with the death of Morrison.\r\n\r\nNaive Heyst! As if anybody would . . . Nobody amongst us had any\r\ninterest in men who went home. They were all right; they did not count\r\nany more. Going to Europe was nearly as final as going to Heaven. It\r\nremoved a man from the world of hazard and adventure.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, many of us did not hear of this death till months\r\nafterwards--from Schomberg, who disliked Heyst gratuitously and made up\r\na piece of sinister whispered gossip:\r\n\r\n"That\'s what comes of having anything to do with that fellow. He\r\nsqueezes you dry like a lemon, then chucks you out--sends you home to\r\ndie. Take warning by Morrison!"\r\n\r\nOf course, we laughed at the innkeeper\'s suggestions of black mystery.\r\nSeveral of us heard that Heyst was prepared to go to Europe himself,\r\nto push on his coal enterprise personally; but he never went. It wasn\'t\r\nnecessary. The company was formed without him, and his nomination of\r\nmanager in the tropics came out to him by post.\r\n\r\nFrom the first he had selected Samburan, or Round Island, for the\r\ncentral station. Some copies of the prospectus issued in Europe, having\r\nfound their way out East, were passed from hand to hand. We greatly\r\nadmired the map which accompanied them for the edification of the\r\nshareholders. On it Samburan was represented as the central spot of the\r\nEastern Hemisphere with its name engraved in enormous capitals. Heavy\r\nlines radiated from it in all directions through the tropics, figuring a\r\nmysterious and effective star--lines of influence or lines of distance,\r\nor something of that sort. Company promoters have an imagination of\r\ntheir own. There\'s no more romantic temperament on earth than the\r\ntemperament of a company promoter. Engineers came out, coolies were\r\nimported, bungalows were put up on Samburan, a gallery driven into the\r\nhillside, and actually some coal got out.\r\n\r\nThese manifestations shook the soberest minds. For a time everybody in\r\nthe islands was talking of the Tropical Belt Coal, and even those who\r\nsmiled quietly to themselves were only hiding their uneasiness. Oh, yes;\r\nit had come, and anybody could see what would be the consequences--the\r\nend of the individual trader, smothered under a great invasion of\r\nsteamers. We could not afford to buy steamers. Not we. And Heyst was the\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n"You know, Heyst, enchanted Heyst."\r\n\r\n"Oh, come! He has been no better than a loafer around here as far back\r\nas any of us can remember."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he said he was looking for facts. Well, he\'s got hold of one that\r\nwill do for all of us," commented a bitter voice.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what they call development--and be hanged to it!" muttered\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nNever was Heyst talked about so much in the tropical belt before.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he a Swedish baron or something?"\r\n\r\n"He, a baron? Get along with you!"\r\n\r\nFor my part I haven\'t the slightest doubt that he was. While he was\r\nstill drifting amongst the islands, enigmatical and disregarded like an\r\ninsignificant ghost, he told me so himself on a certain occasion. It\r\nwas a long time before he materialized in this alarming way into the\r\ndestroyer of our little industry--Heyst the Enemy.\r\n\r\nIt became the fashion with a good many to speak of Heyst as the Enemy.\r\nHe was very concrete, very visible now. He was rushing all over the\r\nArchipelago, jumping in and out of local mail-packets as if they had\r\nbeen tram-cars, here, there, and everywhere--organizing with all his\r\nmight. This was no mooning about. This was business. And this sudden\r\ndisplay of purposeful energy shook the incredulity of the most\r\nsceptical more than any scientific demonstration of the value of these\r\ncoal-outcrops could have done. It was impressive. Schomberg was the\r\nonly one who resisted the infection. Big, manly in a portly style,\r\nand profusely bearded, with a glass of beer in his thick paw, he would\r\napproach some table where the topic of the hour was being discussed,\r\nwould listen for a moment, and then come out with his invariable\r\ndeclaration:\r\n\r\n"All this is very well, gentlemen; but he can\'t throw any of his\r\ncoal-dust in my eyes. There\'s nothing in it. Why, there can\'t be\r\nanything in it. A fellow like that for manager? Phoo!"\r\n\r\nWas it the clairvoyance of imbecile hatred, or mere stupid tenacity of\r\nopinion, which ends sometimes by scoring against the world in a most\r\nastonishing manner? Most of us can remember instances of triumphant\r\nfolly; and that ass Schomberg triumphed. The T.B.C. Company went into\r\nliquidation, as I began by telling you. The Tesmans washed their hands\r\nof it. The Government cancelled those famous contracts, the talk died\r\nout, and presently it was remarked here and there that Heyst had faded\r\ncompletely away. He had become invisible, as in those early days when\r\nhe used to make a bolt clear out of sight in his attempts to break away\r\nfrom the enchantment of "these isles," either in the direction of New\r\nGuinea or in the direction of Saigon--to cannibals or to cafes. The\r\nenchanted Heyst! Had he at last broken the spell? Had he died? We were\r\ntoo indifferent to wonder overmuch. You see we had on the whole liked\r\nhim well enough. And liking is not sufficient to keep going the interest\r\none takes in a human being. With hatred, apparently, it is otherwise.\r\nSchomberg couldn\'t forget Heyst. The keen, manly Teutonic creature was a\r\ngood hater. A fool often is.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, gentlemen. Have you got everything you want? So! Good!\r\nYou see? What was I always telling you? Aha! There was nothing in it. I\r\nknew it. But what I would like to know is what became of that--Swede."\r\n\r\nHe put a stress on the word Swede as if it meant scoundrel. He detested\r\nScandinavians generally. Why? Goodness only knows. A fool like that is\r\nunfathomable. He continued:\r\n\r\n"It\'s five months or more since I have spoken to anybody who has seen\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nAs I have said, we were not much interested; but Schomberg, of course,\r\ncould not understand that. He was grotesquely dense. Whenever three\r\npeople came together in his hotel, he took good care that Heyst should\r\nbe with them.\r\n\r\n"I hope the fellow did not go and drown himself," he would add with a\r\ncomical earnestness that ought to have made us shudder; only our crowd\r\nwas superficial, and did not apprehend the psychology of this pious\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n"Why? Heyst isn\'t in debt to you for drinks is he?" somebody asked him\r\nonce with shallow scorn.\r\n\r\n"Drinks! Oh, dear no!"\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper was not mercenary. Teutonic temperament seldom is. But he\r\nput on a sinister expression to tell us that Heyst had not paid perhaps\r\nthree visits altogether to his "establishment." This was Heyst\'s crime,\r\nfor which Schomberg wished him nothing less than a long and tormented\r\nexistence. Observe the Teutonic sense of proportion and nice forgiving\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nAt last, one afternoon, Schomberg was seen approaching a group of his\r\ncustomers. He was obviously in high glee. He squared his manly chest\r\nwith great importance.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I have news of him. Who? why, that Swede. He is still\r\non Samburan. He\'s never been away from it. The company is gone,\r\nthe engineers are gone, the clerks are gone, the coolies are gone,\r\neverything\'s gone; but there he sticks. Captain Davidson, coming by from\r\nthe westward, saw him with his own eyes. Something white on the wharf,\r\nso he steamed in and went ashore in a small boat. Heyst, right enough.\r\nPut a book into his pocket, always very polite. Been strolling on\r\nthe wharf and reading. \'I remain in possession here,\' he told Captain\r\nDavidson. What I want to know is what he gets to eat there. A piece of\r\ndried fish now and then--what? That\'s coming down pretty low for a man\r\nwho turned up his nose at my table d\'hote!"\r\n\r\nHe winked with immense malice. A bell started ringing, and he led the\r\nway to the dining-room as if into a temple, very grave, with the air\r\nof a benefactor of mankind. His ambition was to feed it at a profitable\r\nprice, and his delight was to talk of it behind its back. It was very\r\ncharacteristic of him to gloat over the idea of Heyst having nothing\r\ndecent to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nA few of us who were sufficiently interested went to Davidson for\r\ndetails. These were not many. He told us that he passed to the north of\r\nSamburan on purpose to see what was going on. At first, it looked as if\r\nthat side of the island had been altogether abandoned. This was what he\r\nexpected. Presently, above the dense mass of vegetation that Samburan\r\npresents to view, he saw the head of the flagstaff without a flag. Then,\r\nwhile steaming across the slight indentation which for a time was known\r\nofficially as Black Diamond Bay, he made out with his glass the white\r\nfigure on the coaling-wharf. It could be no one but Heyst.\r\n\r\n"I thought for certain he wanted to be taken off, so I steamed in. He\r\nmade no signs. However, I lowered a boat. I could not see another living\r\nbeing anywhere. Yes. He had a book in his hand. He looked exactly as we\r\nhave always seen him--very neat, white shoes, cork helmet. He explained\r\nto me that he had always had a taste for solitude. It was the first I\r\never heard of it, I told him. He only smiled. What could I say? He isn\'t\r\nthe sort of man one can speak familiarly to. There\'s something in him.\r\nOne doesn\'t care to.\r\n\r\n"\'But what\'s the object? Are you thinking of keeping possession of the\r\nmine?\' I asked him.\r\n\r\n"\'Something of the sort,\' he says. \'I am keeping hold.\'\r\n\r\n"\'But all this is as dead as Julius Caesar,\' I cried. \'In fact, you have\r\nnothing worth holding on to, Heyst.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, I am done with facts,\' says he, putting his hand to his helmet\r\nsharply with one of his short bows."\r\n\r\nThus dismissed, Davidson went on board his ship, swung her out, and as\r\nhe was steaming away he watched from the bridge Heyst walking shoreward\r\nalong the wharf. He marched into the long grass and vanished--all but\r\nthe top of his white cork helmet, which seemed to swim in a green sea.\r\nThen that too disappeared, as if it had sunk into the living depths of\r\nthe tropical vegetation, which is more jealous of men\'s conquests than\r\nthe ocean, and which was about to close over the last vestiges of the\r\nliquidated Tropical Belt Coal Company--A. Heyst, manager in the East.\r\n\r\nDavidson, a good, simple fellow in his way, was strangely affected. It\r\nis to be noted that he knew very little of Heyst. He was one of those\r\nwhom Heyst\'s finished courtesy of attitude and intonation most strongly\r\ndisconcerted. He himself was a fellow of fine feeling, I think, though\r\nof course he had no more polish than the rest of us. We were naturally\r\na hail-fellow-well-met crowd, with standards of our own--no worse, I\r\ndaresay, than other people\'s; but polish was not one of them. Davidson\'s\r\nfineness was real enough to alter the course of the steamer he\r\ncommanded. Instead of passing to the south of Samburan, he made it his\r\npractice to take the passage along the north shore, within about a mile\r\nof the wharf.\r\n\r\n"He can see us if he likes to see us," remarked Davidson. Then he had an\r\nafterthought: "I say! I hope he won\'t think I am intruding, eh?"\r\n\r\nWe reassured him on the point of correct behaviour. The sea is open to\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThis slight deviation added some ten miles to Davidson\'s round trip, but\r\nas that was sixteen hundred miles it did not matter much.\r\n\r\n"I have told my owner of it," said the conscientious commander of the\r\nSissie.\r\n\r\nHis owner had a face like an ancient lemon. He was small and\r\nwizened--which was strange, because generally a Chinaman, as he grows in\r\nprosperity, puts on inches of girth and stature. To serve a Chinese firm\r\nis not so bad. Once they become convinced you deal straight by them,\r\ntheir confidence becomes unlimited. You can do no wrong. So Davidson\'s\r\nold Chinaman squeaked hurriedly:\r\n\r\n"All right, all right, all right. You do what you like, captain--"\r\n\r\nAnd there was an end of the matter; not altogether, though. From time to\r\ntime the Chinaman used to ask Davidson about the white man. He was still\r\nthere, eh?\r\n\r\n"I never see him," Davidson had to confess to his owner, who would peer\r\nat him silently through round, horn-rimmed spectacles, several sizes too\r\nlarge for his little old face. "I never see him."\r\n\r\nTo me, on occasions he would say:\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t a doubt he\'s there. He hides. It\'s very unpleasant." Davidson\r\nwas a little vexed with Heyst. "Funny thing," he went on. "Of all the\r\npeople I speak to, nobody ever asks after him but that Chinaman of\r\nmine--and Schomberg," he added after a while.\r\n\r\nYes, Schomberg, of course. He was asking everybody about everything, and\r\narranging the information into the most scandalous shape his imagination\r\ncould invent. From time to time he would step up, his blinking,\r\ncushioned eyes, his thick lips, his very chestnut beard, looking full of\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n"Evening, gentlemen. Have you got all you want? So! Good! Well, I am\r\ntold the jungle has choked the very sheds in Black Diamond Bay. Fact.\r\nHe\'s a hermit in the wilderness now. But what can this manager get to\r\neat there? It beats me."\r\n\r\nSometimes a stranger would inquire with natural curiosity:\r\n\r\n"Who? What manager?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a certain Swede,"--with a sinister emphasis, as if he were saying\r\n"a certain brigand." "Well known here. He\'s turned hermit from shame.\r\nThat\'s what the devil does when he\'s found out."\r\n\r\nHermit. This was the latest of the more or less witty labels applied\r\nto Heyst during his aimless pilgrimage in this section of the tropical\r\nbelt, where the inane clacking of Schomberg\'s tongue vexed our ears.\r\n\r\nBut apparently Heyst was not a hermit by temperament. The sight of his\r\nland was not invincibly odious to him. We must believe this, since\r\nfor some reason or other he did come out from his retreat for a while.\r\nPerhaps it was only to see whether there were any letters for him at the\r\nTesmans. I don\'t know. No one knows. But this reappearance shows that\r\nhis detachment from the world was not complete. And incompleteness of\r\nany sort leads to trouble. Axel Heyst ought not to have cared for his\r\nletters--or whatever it was that brought him out after something more\r\nthan a year and a half in Samburan. But it was of no use. He had not the\r\nhermit\'s vocation! That was the trouble, it seems.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, he suddenly reappeared in the world, broad chest,\r\nbald forehead, long moustaches, polite manner, and all--the complete\r\nHeyst, even to the kindly sunken eyes on which there still rested the\r\nshadow of Morrison\'s death. Naturally, it was Davidson who had given him\r\na lift out of his forsaken island. There were no other opportunities,\r\nunless some native craft were passing by--a very remote and\r\nunsatisfactory chance to wait for. Yes, he came out with Davidson, to\r\nwhom he volunteered the statement that it was only for a short time--a\r\nfew days, no more. He meant to go back to Samburan.\r\n\r\nDavidson expressing his horror and incredulity of such foolishness,\r\nHeyst explained that when the company came into being he had his few\r\nbelongings sent out from Europe.\r\n\r\nTo Davidson, as to any of us, the idea of Heyst, the wandering drifting,\r\nunattached Heyst, having any belongings of the sort that can furnish a\r\nhouse was startlingly novel. It was grotesquely fantastic. It was like a\r\nbird owning real property.\r\n\r\n"Belongings? Do you mean chairs and tables?" Davidson asked with\r\nunconcealed astonishment.\r\n\r\nHeyst did mean that. "My poor father died in London. It has been all\r\nstored there ever since," he explained.\r\n\r\n"For all these years?" exclaimed Davidson, thinking how long we all had\r\nknown Heyst flitting from tree to tree in a wilderness.\r\n\r\n"Even longer," said Heyst, who had understood very well.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to imply that he had been wandering before he came under our\r\nobservation. In what regions? And what early age? Mystery. Perhaps he\r\nwas a bird that had never had a nest.\r\n\r\n"I left school early," he remarked once to Davidson, on the passage. "It\r\nwas in England. A very good school. I was not a shining success there."\r\n\r\nThe confessions of Heyst. Not one of us--with the probable exception of\r\nMorrison, who was dead--had ever heard so much of his history. It\r\nlooks as if the experience of hermit life had the power to loosen one\'s\r\ntongue, doesn\'t it?\r\n\r\nDuring that memorable passage, in the Sissie, which took about two days,\r\nhe volunteered other hints--for you could not call it information--about\r\nhis history. And Davidson was interested. He was interested not because\r\nthe hints were exciting but because of that innate curiosity about our\r\nfellows which is a trait of human nature. Davidson\'s existence, too,\r\nrunning the Sissie along the Java Sea and back again, was distinctly\r\nmonotonous and, in a sense, lonely. He never had any sort of company on\r\nboard. Native deck-passengers in plenty, of course, but never a white\r\nman, so the presence of Heyst for two days must have been a godsend.\r\nDavidson was telling us all about it afterwards. Heyst said that his\r\nfather had written a lot of books. He was a philosopher.\r\n\r\n"Seems to me he must have been something of a crank, too," was\r\nDavidson\'s comment. "Apparently he had quarrelled with his people in\r\nSweden. Just the sort of father you would expect Heyst to have. Isn\'t\r\nhe a bit of a crank himself? He told me that directly his father died he\r\nlit out into the wide world on his own, and had been on the move till he\r\nfetched up against this famous coal business. Fits the son of the father\r\nsomehow, don\'t you think?"\r\n\r\nFor the rest, Heyst was as polite as ever. He offered to pay for his\r\npassage; but when Davidson refused to hear of it he seized him heartily\r\nby the hand, gave one of his courtly bows, and declared that he was\r\ntouched by his friendly proceedings.\r\n\r\n"I am not alluding to this trifling amount which you decline to take,"\r\nhe went on, giving a shake to Davidson\'s hand. "But I am touched by your\r\nhumanity." Another shake. "Believe me, I am profoundly aware of having\r\nbeen an object of it." Final shake of the hand. All this meant that\r\nHeyst understood in a proper sense the little Sissie\'s periodic\r\nappearance in sight of his hermitage.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a genuine gentleman," Davidson said to us. "I was really sorry\r\nwhen he went ashore."\r\n\r\nWe asked him where he had left Heyst.\r\n\r\n"Why, in Sourabaya--where else?"\r\n\r\nThe Tesmans had their principal counting-house in Sourabaya. There had\r\nlong existed a connection between Heyst and the Tesmans. The incongruity\r\nof a hermit having agents did not strike us, nor yet the absurdity of a\r\nforgotten cast-off, derelict manager of a wrecked, collapsed, vanished\r\nenterprise, having business to attend to. We said Sourabaya, of course,\r\nand took it for granted that he would stay with one of the Tesmans.\r\nOne of us even wondered what sort of reception he would get; for it was\r\nknown that Julius Tesman was unreasonably bitter about the Tropical\r\nBelt Coal fiasco. But Davidson set us right. It was nothing of the\r\nkind. Heyst went to stay in Schomberg\'s hotel, going ashore in the hotel\r\nlaunch. Not that Schomberg would think of sending his launch alongside\r\na mere trader like the Sissie. But she had been meeting a coasting\r\nmail-packet, and had been signalled to. Schomberg himself was steering\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"You should have seen Schomberg\'s eyes bulge out when Heyst jumped in\r\nwith an ancient brown leather bag!" said Davidson. "He pretended not\r\nto know who it was--at first, anyway. I didn\'t go ashore with them. We\r\ndidn\'t stay more than a couple of hours altogether. Landed two thousand\r\ncoconuts and cleared out. I have agreed to pick him up again on my next\r\ntrip in twenty days\' time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\nDavidson happened to be two days late on his return trip; no great\r\nmatter, certainly, but he made a point of going ashore at once, during\r\nthe hottest hour of the afternoon, to look for Heyst. Schomberg\'s hotel\r\nstood back in an extensive enclosure containing a garden, some large\r\ntrees, and, under their spreading boughs, a detached "hall available\r\nfor concerts and other performances," as Schomberg worded it in his\r\nadvertisements. Torn, and fluttering bills, intimating in heavy red\r\ncapitals CONCERTS EVERY NIGHT, were stuck on the brick pillars on each\r\nside of the gateway.\r\n\r\nThe walk had been long and confoundedly sunny. Davidson stood wiping his\r\nwet neck and face on what Schomberg called "the piazza." Several doors\r\nopened on to it, but all the screens were down. Not a soul was in sight,\r\nnot even a China boy--nothing but a lot of painted iron chairs and\r\ntables. Solitude, shade, and gloomy silence--and a faint, treacherous\r\nbreeze which came from under the trees and quite unexpectedly caused the\r\nmelting Davidson to shiver slightly--the little shiver of the tropics\r\nwhich in Sourabaya, especially, often means fever and the hospital to\r\nthe incautious white man.\r\n\r\nThe prudent Davidson sought shelter in the nearest darkened room. In the\r\nartificial dusk, beyond the levels of shrouded billiard-tables, a white\r\nform heaved up from two chairs on which it had been extended. The middle\r\nof the day, table d\'hote tiffin once over, was Schomberg\'s easy time. He\r\nlounged out, portly, deliberate, on the defensive, the great fair beard\r\nlike a cuirass over his manly chest. He did not like Davidson, never a\r\nvery faithful client of his. He hit a bell on one of the tables as he\r\nwent by, and asked in a distant, Officer-in-Reserve manner:\r\n\r\n"You desire?"\r\n\r\nThe good Davidson, still sponging his wet neck, declared with simplicity\r\nthat he had come to fetch away Heyst, as agreed.\r\n\r\n"Not here!"\r\n\r\nA Chinaman appeared in response to the bell. Schomberg turned to him\r\nvery severely:\r\n\r\n"Take the gentleman\'s order."\r\n\r\nDavidson had to be going. Couldn\'t wait--only begged that Heyst should\r\nbe informed that the Sissie would leave at midnight.\r\n\r\n"Not--here, I am telling you!"\r\n\r\nDavidson slapped his thigh in concern.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! Hospital, I suppose." A natural enough surmise in a very\r\nfeverish locality.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant of the Reserve only pursed up his mouth and raised his\r\neyebrows without looking at him. It might have meant anything, but\r\nDavidson dismissed the hospital idea with confidence. However, he had to\r\nget hold of Heyst between this and midnight:\r\n\r\n"He has been staying here?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he was staying here."\r\n\r\n"Can you tell me where he is now?" Davidson went on placidly. Within\r\nhimself he was beginning to grow anxious, having developed the affection\r\nof a self-appointed protector towards Heyst. The answer he got was:\r\n\r\n"Can\'t tell. It\'s none of my business," accompanied by majestic\r\noscillations of the hotel-keeper\'s head, hinting at some awful mystery.\r\n\r\nDavidson was placidity itself. It was his nature. He did not betray his\r\nsentiments, which were not favourable to Schomberg.\r\n\r\n"I am sure to find out at the Tesmans\' office," he thought. But it was\r\na very hot hour, and if Heyst was down at the port he would have learned\r\nalready that the Sissie was in. It was even possible that Heyst had\r\nalready gone on board, where he could enjoy a coolness denied to the\r\ntown. Davidson, being stout, was much preoccupied with coolness and\r\ninclined to immobility. He lingered awhile, as if irresolute. Schomberg,\r\nat the door, looking out, affected perfect indifference. He could not\r\nkeep it up, though. Suddenly he turned inward and asked with brusque\r\nrage:\r\n\r\n"You wanted to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," said Davidson. "We agreed to meet--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you bother. He doesn\'t care about that now."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you can judge for yourself. He isn\'t here, is he? You take my\r\nword for it. Don\'t you bother about him. I am advising you as a friend."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said, Davidson, inwardly startled at the savage tone. "I\r\nthink I will sit down for a moment and have a drink, after all."\r\n\r\nThis was not what Schomberg had expected to hear. He called brutally:\r\n\r\n"Boy!"\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman approached, and after referring him to the white man by a\r\nnod the hotel-keeper departed, muttering to himself. Davidson heard him\r\ngnash his teeth as he went.\r\n\r\nDavidson sat alone with the billiard-tables as if there had been not a\r\nsoul staying in the hotel. His placidity was so genuine that he was not\r\nunduly, fretting himself over the absence of Heyst, or the mysterious\r\nmanners Schomberg had treated him to. He was considering these things in\r\nhis own fairly shrewd way. Something had happened; and he was loath to\r\ngo away to investigate, being restrained by a presentiment that somehow\r\nenlightenment would come to him there. A poster of CONCERTS EVERY\r\nEVENING, like those on the gate, but in a good state of preservation,\r\nhung on the wall fronting him. He looked at it idly and was struck by\r\nthe fact--then not so very common--that it was a ladies\' orchestra;\r\n"Zangiacomo\'s eastern tour--eighteen performers." The poster stated\r\nthat they had had the honour of playing their select repertoire before\r\nvarious colonial excellencies, also before pashas, sheiks, chiefs, H. H.\r\nthe Sultan of Mascate, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nDavidson felt sorry for the eighteen lady-performers. He knew what that\r\nsort of life was like, the sordid conditions and brutal incidents of\r\nsuch tours led by such Zangiacomos who often were anything but musicians\r\nby profession. While he was staring at the poster, a door somewhere at\r\nhis back opened, and a woman came in who was looked upon as Schomberg\'s\r\nwife, no doubt with truth. As somebody remarked cynically once, she was\r\ntoo unattractive to be anything else. The opinion that he treated her\r\nabominably was based on her frightened expression. Davidson lifted his\r\nhat to her. Mrs. Schomberg gave him an inclination of her sallow head\r\nand incontinently sat down behind a sort of raised counter, facing the\r\ndoor, with a mirror and rows of bottles at her back. Her hair was very\r\nelaborately done with two ringlets on the left side of her scraggy neck;\r\nher dress was of silk, and she had come on duty for the afternoon. For\r\nsome reason or other Schomberg exacted this from her, though she added\r\nnothing to the fascinations of the place. She sat there in the smoke and\r\nnoise, like an enthroned idol, smiling stupidly over the billiards from\r\ntime to time, speaking to no one, and no one speaking to her. Schomberg\r\nhimself took no more interest in her than may be implied in a sudden\r\nand totally unmotived scowl. Otherwise the very Chinamen ignored her\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nShe had interrupted Davidson in his reflections. Being alone with her,\r\nher silence and open-eyed immobility made him uncomfortable. He was\r\neasily sorry for people. It seemed rude not to take any notice of her.\r\nHe said, in allusion to the poster:\r\n\r\n"Are you having these people in the house?"\r\n\r\nShe was so unused to being addressed by customers that at the sound of\r\nhis voice she jumped in her seat. Davidson was telling us afterwards\r\nthat she jumped exactly like a figure made of wood, without losing her\r\nrigid immobility. She did not even move her eyes; but she answered him\r\nfreely, though her very lips seemed made of wood.\r\n\r\n"They stayed here over a month. They are gone now. They played every\r\nevening."\r\n\r\n"Pretty good, were they?"\r\n\r\nTo this she said nothing; and as she kept on staring fixedly in front\r\nof her, her silence disconcerted Davidson. It looked as if she had not\r\nheard him--which was impossible. Perhaps she drew the line of speech\r\nat the expression of opinions. Schomberg might have trained her, for\r\ndomestic reasons, to keep them to herself. But Davidson felt in honour\r\nobliged to converse; so he said, putting his own interpretation on this\r\nsurprising silence:\r\n\r\n"I see--not much account. Such bands hardly ever are. An Italian lot,\r\nMrs. Schomberg, to judge by the name of the boss?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head negatively.\r\n\r\n"No. He is a German really; only he dyes his hair and beard black for\r\nbusiness. Zangiacomo is his business name."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a curious fact," said Davidson. His head being full of Heyst, it\r\noccurred to him that she might be aware of other facts. This was a very\r\namazing discovery to anyone who looked at Mrs. Schomberg. Nobody had\r\never suspected her of having a mind. I mean even a little of it, I mean\r\nany at all. One was inclined to think of her as an It--an automaton, a\r\nvery plain dummy, with an arrangement for bowing the head at times\r\nand smiling stupidly now and then. Davidson viewed her profile with a\r\nflattened nose, a hollow cheek, and one staring, unwinking, goggle eye.\r\nHe asked himself: Did that speak just now? Will it speak again? It was\r\nas exciting, for the mere wonder of it, as trying to converse with a\r\nmechanism. A smile played about the fat features of Davidson; the smile\r\nof a man making an amusing experiment. He spoke again to her:\r\n\r\n"But the other members of that orchestra were real Italians, were they\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\nOf course, he didn\'t care. He wanted to see whether the mechanism would\r\nwork again. It did. It said they were not. They were of all sorts,\r\napparently. It paused, with the one goggle eye immovably gazing down\r\nthe whole length of the room and through the door opening on to the\r\n"piazza." It paused, then went on in the same low pitch:\r\n\r\n"There was even one English girl."\r\n\r\n"Poor devil!"--said Davidson, "I suppose these women are not much better\r\nthan slaves really. Was that fellow with the dyed beard decent in his\r\nway?"\r\n\r\nThe mechanism remained silent. The sympathetic soul of Davidson drew its\r\nown conclusions.\r\n\r\n"Beastly life for these women!" he said. "When you say an English girl,\r\nMrs. Schomberg, do you really mean a young girl? Some of these orchestra\r\ngirls are no chicks."\r\n\r\n"Young enough," came the low voice out of Mrs. Schomberg\'s unmoved\r\nphysiognomy.\r\n\r\nDavidson, encouraged, remarked that he was sorry for her. He was easily\r\nsorry for people.\r\n\r\n"Where did they go to from here?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"She did not go with them. She ran away."\r\n\r\nThis was the pronouncement Davidson obtained next. It introduced a new\r\nsort of interest.\r\n\r\n"Well! Well!" he exclaimed placidly; and then, with the air of a man who\r\nknows life: "Who with?" he inquired with assurance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Schomberg\'s immobility gave her an appearance of listening\r\nintently. Perhaps she was really listening; but Schomberg must have been\r\nfinishing his sleep in some distant part of the house. The silence was\r\nprofound, and lasted long enough to become startling. Then, enthroned\r\nabove Davidson, she whispered at last:\r\n\r\n"That friend of yours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know I am here looking for a friend," said Davidson hopefully.\r\n"Won\'t you tell me--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve told you"\r\n\r\n"Eh?"\r\n\r\nA mist seemed to roll away from before Davidson\'s eyes, disclosing\r\nsomething he could not believe.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t mean it!" he cried. "He\'s not the man for it." But the last\r\nwords came out in a faint voice. Mrs. Schomberg never moved her head the\r\nleast bit. Davidson, after the shock which made him sit up, went slack\r\nall over.\r\n\r\n"Heyst! Such a perfect gentleman!" he exclaimed weakly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Schomberg did not seem to have heard him. This startling fact did\r\nnot tally somehow with the idea Davidson had of Heyst. He never talked\r\nof women, he never seemed to think of them, or to remember that they\r\nexisted; and then all at once--like this! Running off with a casual\r\norchestra girl!\r\n\r\n"You might have knocked me down with a feather," Davidson told us some\r\ntime afterwards.\r\n\r\nBy then he was taking an indulgent view of both the parties to that\r\namazing transaction. First of all, on reflection, he was by no means\r\ncertain that it prevented Heyst from being a perfect gentleman, as\r\nbefore. He confronted our open grins or quiet smiles with a serious\r\nround face. Heyst had taken the girl away to Samburan; and that was\r\nno joking matter. The loneliness, the ruins of the spot, had impressed\r\nDavidson\'s simple soul. They were incompatible with the frivolous\r\ncomments of people who had not seen it. That black jetty, sticking out\r\nof the jungle into the empty sea; these roof-ridges of deserted houses\r\npeeping dismally above the long grass! Ough! The gigantic and funereal\r\nblackboard sign of the Tropical Belt Coal Company, still emerging from a\r\nwild growth of bushes like an inscription stuck above a grave figured by\r\nthe tall heap of unsold coal at the shore end of the wharf, added to the\r\ngeneral desolation.\r\n\r\nThus was the sensitive Davidson. The girl must have been miserable\r\nindeed to follow such a strange man to such a spot. Heyst had, no doubt,\r\ntold her the truth. He was a gentleman. But no words could do justice to\r\nthe conditions of life on Samburan. A desert island was nothing to it.\r\nMoreover, when you were cast away on a desert island--why, you could not\r\nhelp yourself; but to expect a fiddle-playing girl out of an ambulant\r\nladies\' orchestra to remain content there for a day, for one single day,\r\nwas inconceivable. She would be frightened at the first sight of it. She\r\nwould scream.\r\n\r\nThe capacity for sympathy in these stout, placid men! Davidson was\r\nstirred to the depths; and it was easy to see that it was about Heyst\r\nthat he was concerned. We asked him if he had passed that way lately.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I always do--about half a mile off."\r\n\r\n"Seen anybody about?"\r\n\r\n"No, not a soul. Not a shadow."\r\n\r\n"Did you blow your whistle?"\r\n\r\n"Blow the whistle? You think I would do such a thing?"\r\n\r\nHe rejected the mere possibility of such an unwarrantable intrusion.\r\nWonderfully delicate fellow, Davidson!\r\n\r\n"Well, but how do you know that they are there?" he was naturally asked.\r\n\r\nHeyst had entrusted Mrs. Schomberg with a message for Davidson--a few\r\nlines in pencil on a scrap of crumpled paper. It was to the effect: that\r\nan unforeseen necessity was driving him away before the appointed time.\r\nHe begged Davidson\'s indulgence for the apparent discourtesy. The woman\r\nof the house--meaning Mrs. Schomberg--would give him the facts, though\r\nunable to explain them, of course.\r\n\r\n"What was there to explain?" wondered Davidson dubiously.\r\n\r\n"He took a fancy to that fiddle-playing girl, and--"\r\n\r\n"And she to him, apparently," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Wonderfully quick work," reflected Davidson. "What do you think will\r\ncome of it?"\r\n\r\n"Repentance, I should say. But how is it that Mrs. Schomberg has been\r\nselected for a confidante?"\r\n\r\nFor indeed a waxwork figure would have seemed more useful than that\r\nwoman whom we all were accustomed to see sitting elevated above the two\r\nbilliard-tables--without expression, without movement, without voice,\r\nwithout sight.\r\n\r\n"Why, she helped the girl to bolt," said Davidson turning at me his\r\ninnocent eyes, rounded by the state of constant amazement in which\r\nthis affair had left him, like those shocks of terror or sorrow which\r\nsometimes leave their victim afflicted by nervous trembling. It looked\r\nas though he would never get over it.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Schomberg jerked Heyst\'s note, twisted like a pipe-light, into my\r\nlap while I sat there unsuspecting," Davidson went on. "Directly I had\r\nrecovered my senses, I asked her what on earth she had to do with it\r\nthat Heyst should leave it with her. And then, behaving like a painted\r\nimage rather than a live woman, she whispered, just loud enough for me\r\nto hear:\r\n\r\n"I helped them. I got her things together, tied them up in my own shawl,\r\nand threw them into the compound out of a back window. I did it."\r\n\r\n"That woman that you would say hadn\'t the pluck to lift her little\r\nfinger!" marvelled Davidson in his quiet, slightly panting voice. "What\r\ndo you think of that?"\r\n\r\nI thought she must have had some interest of her own to serve. She was\r\ntoo lifeless to be suspected of impulsive compassion. It was impossible\r\nto think that Heyst had bribed her. Whatever means he had, he had\r\nnot the means to do that. Or could it be that she was moved by\r\nthat disinterested passion for delivering a woman to a man which in\r\nrespectable spheres is called matchmaking?--a highly irregular example\r\nof it!\r\n\r\n"It must have been a very small bundle," remarked Davidson further.\r\n\r\n"I imagine the girl must have been specially attractive," I said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. She was miserable. I don\'t suppose it was more than\r\na little linen and a couple of those white frocks they wear on the\r\nplatform."\r\n\r\nDavidson pursued his own train of thought. He supposed that such a thing\r\nhad never been heard of in the history of the tropics. For where could\r\nyou find anyone to steal a girl out of an orchestra? No doubt fellows\r\nhere and there took a fancy to some pretty one--but it was not for\r\nrunning away with her. Oh dear no! It needed a lunatic like Heyst.\r\n\r\n"Only think what it means," wheezed Davidson, imaginative under his\r\ninvincible placidity. "Just only try to think! Brooding alone on\r\nSamburan has upset his brain. He never stopped to consider, or he\r\ncouldn\'t have done it. No sane man . . . How is a thing like that to go\r\non? What\'s he going to do with her in the end? It\'s madness."\r\n\r\n"You say that he\'s mad. Schomberg tells us that he must be starving on\r\nhis island; so he may end yet by eating her," I suggested.\r\n\r\nMrs. Schomberg had had no time to enter into details, Davidson told us.\r\nIndeed, the wonder was that they had been left alone so long. The\r\ndrowsy afternoon was slipping by. Footsteps and voices resounded on the\r\nveranda--I beg pardon, the piazza; the scraping of chairs, the ping of\r\na smitten bell. Customers were turning up. Mrs. Schomberg was begging\r\nDavidson hurriedly, but without looking at him, to say nothing to\r\nanyone, when on a half-uttered word her nervous whisper was cut short.\r\nThrough a small inner door Schomberg came in, his hair brushed, his\r\nbeard combed neatly, but his eyelids still heavy from his nap. He looked\r\nwith suspicion at Davidson, and even glanced at his wife; but he was\r\nbaffled by the natural placidity of the one and the acquired habit of\r\nimmobility in the other.\r\n\r\n"Have you sent out the drinks?" he asked surlily.\r\n\r\nShe did not open her lips, because just then the head boy appeared with\r\na loaded tray, on his way out. Schomberg went to the door and greeted\r\nthe customers outside, but did not join them. He remained blocking\r\nhalf the doorway, with his back to the room, and was still there when\r\nDavidson, after sitting still for a while, rose to go. At the noise\r\nhe made Schomberg turned his head, watched him lift his hat to Mrs.\r\nSchomberg and receive her wooden bow accompanied by a stupid grin, and\r\nthen looked away. He was loftily dignified. Davidson stopped at the\r\ndoor, deep in his simplicity.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you won\'t tell me anything about my friend\'s absence," he\r\nsaid. "My friend Heyst, you know. I suppose the only course for me now\r\nis to make inquiries down at the port. I shall hear something there, I\r\ndon\'t doubt."\r\n\r\n"Make inquiries of the devil!" replied Schomberg in a hoarse mutter.\r\n\r\nDavidson\'s purpose in addressing the hotel-keeper had been mainly to\r\nmake Mrs. Schomberg safe from suspicion; but he would fain have heard\r\nsomething more of Heyst\'s exploit from another point of view. It was\r\na shrewd try. It was successful in a rather startling way, because the\r\nhotel-keeper\'s point of view was horribly abusive. All of a sudden, in\r\nthe same hoarse sinister tone, he proceeded to call Heyst many names, of\r\nwhich "pig-dog" was not the worst, with such vehemence that he actually\r\nchoked himself. Profiting from the pause, Davidson, whose temperament\r\ncould withstand worse shocks, remonstrated in an undertone:\r\n\r\n"It\'s unreasonable to get so angry as that. Even if he had run off with\r\nyour cash-box--"\r\n\r\nThe big hotel-keeper bent down and put his infuriated face close to\r\nDavidson\'s.\r\n\r\n"My cash-box! My--he--look here, Captain Davidson! He ran off with a\r\ngirl. What do I care for the girl? The girl is nothing to me."\r\n\r\nHe shot out an infamous word which made Davidson start. That\'s what the\r\ngirl was; and he reiterated the assertion that she was nothing to him.\r\nWhat he was concerned for was the good name of his house. Wherever he\r\nhad been established, he had always had "artist parties" staying in his\r\nhouse. One recommended him to the others; but what would happen now,\r\nwhen it got about that leaders ran the risk in his house--his house--of\r\nlosing members of their troupe? And just now, when he had spent seven\r\nhundred and thirty-four guilders in building a concert-hall in his\r\ncompound. Was that a thing to do in a respectable hotel? The cheek, the\r\nindecency, the impudence, the atrocity! Vagabond, impostor, swindler,\r\nruffian, schwein-hund!\r\n\r\nHe had seized Davidson by a button of his coat, detaining him in\r\nthe doorway, and exactly in the line of Mrs. Schomberg\'s stony gaze.\r\nDavidson stole a glance in that direction and thought of making some\r\nsort of reassuring sign to her, but she looked so bereft of senses, and\r\nalmost of life, perched up there, that it seemed not worth while.\r\nHe disengaged his button with firm placidity. Thereupon, with a last\r\nstifled curse, Schomberg vanished somewhere within, to try and compose\r\nhis spirits in solitude. Davidson stepped out on the veranda. The party\r\nof customers there had become aware of the explosive interlude in the\r\ndoorway. Davidson knew one of these men, and nodded to him in passing;\r\nbut his acquaintance called out:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he in a filthy temper? He\'s been like that ever since."\r\n\r\nThe speaker laughed aloud, while all the others sat smiling. Davidson\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n"Yes, rather." His feelings were, he told us, those of bewildered\r\nresignation; but of course that was no more visible to the others than\r\nthe emotions of a turtle when it withdraws into its shell.\r\n\r\n"It seems unreasonable," he murmured thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but they had a scrap!" the other said.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? Was there a fight!--a fight with Heyst?" asked\r\nDavidson, much perturbed, if somewhat incredulous.\r\n\r\n"Heyst? No, these two--the bandmaster, the fellow who\'s taking these\r\nwomen about and our Schomberg. Signor Zangiacomo ran amuck in the\r\nmorning, and went for our worthy friend. I tell you, they were rolling\r\non the floor together on this very veranda, after chasing each other all\r\nover the house, doors slamming, women screaming, seventeen of them, in\r\nthe dining-room; Chinamen up the trees. Hey, John? You climb tree to see\r\nthe fight, eh?"\r\n\r\nThe boy, almond-eyed and impassive, emitted a scornful grunt, finished\r\nwiping the table, and withdrew.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what it was--a real, go-as-you-please scrap. And Zangiacomo\r\nbegan it. Oh, here\'s Schomberg. Say, Schomberg, didn\'t he fly at you,\r\nwhen the girl was missed, because it was you who insisted that the\r\nartists should go about the audience during the interval?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg had reappeared in the doorway. He advanced. His bearing\r\nwas stately, but his nostrils were extraordinarily expanded, and he\r\ncontrolled his voice with apparent effort.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. That was only business. I quoted him special terms and\r\nall for your sake, gentlemen. I was thinking of my regular customers.\r\nThere\'s nothing to do in the evenings in this town. I think, gentlemen,\r\nyou were all pleased at the opportunity of hearing a little good music;\r\nand where\'s the harm of offering a grenadine, or what not, to a lady\r\nartist? But that fellow--that Swede--he got round the girl. He got round\r\nall the people out here. I\'ve been watching him for years. You remember\r\nhow he got round Morrison."\r\n\r\nHe changed front abruptly, as if on parade, and marched off. The\r\ncustomers at the table exchanged glances silently. Davidson\'s attitude\r\nwas that of a spectator. Schomberg\'s moody pacing of the billiard-room\r\ncould be heard on the veranda.\r\n\r\n"And the funniest part is," resumed the man who had been speaking\r\nbefore--an English clerk in a Dutch house--"the funniest part is that\r\nbefore nine o\'clock that same morning those two were driving together\r\nin a gharry down to the port, to look for Heyst and the girl. I saw them\r\nrushing around making inquiries. I don\'t know what they would have\r\ndone to the girl, but they seemed quite ready to fall upon your Heyst,\r\nDavidson, and kill him on the quay."\r\n\r\nHe had never, he said, seen anything so queer. Those two investigators\r\nworking feverishly to the same end were glaring at each other with\r\nsurprising ferocity. In hatred and mistrust they entered a steam-launch,\r\nand went flying from ship to ship all over the harbour, causing no end\r\nof sensation. The captains of vessels, coming on shore later in the day,\r\nbrought tales of a strange invasion, and wanted to know who were the two\r\noffensive lunatics in a steam-launch, apparently after a man and a girl,\r\nand telling a story of which one could make neither head nor tail. Their\r\nreception by the roadstead was generally unsympathetic, even to the\r\npoint of the mate of an American ship bundling them out over the rail\r\nwith unseemly precipitation.\r\n\r\nMeantime Heyst and the girl were a good few miles away, having gone in\r\nthe night on board one of the Tesman schooners bound to the eastward.\r\nThis was known afterwards from the Javanese boatmen whom Heyst hired\r\nfor the purpose at three o\'clock in the morning. The Tesman schooner had\r\nsailed at daylight with the usual land breeze, and was probably still in\r\nsight in the offing at the time. However, the two pursuers after their\r\nexperience with the American mate, made for the shore. On landing, they\r\nhad another violent row in the German language. But there was no second\r\nfight; and finally, with looks of fierce animosity, they got together\r\ninto a gharry--obviously with the frugal view of sharing expenses--and\r\ndrove away, leaving an astonished little crowd of Europeans and natives\r\non the quay.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing this wondrous tale, Davidson went away from the hotel\r\nveranda, which was filling with Schomberg\'s regular customers. Heyst\'s\r\nescapade was the general topic of conversation. Never before had that\r\nunaccountable individual been the cause of so much gossip, he judged.\r\nNo! Not even in the beginnings of the Tropical Belt Coal Company when\r\nbecoming for a moment a public character was he the object of a silly\r\ncriticism and unintelligent envy for every vagabond and adventurer in\r\nthe islands. Davidson concluded that people liked to discuss that sort\r\nof scandal better than any other.\r\n\r\nI asked him if he believed that this was such a great scandal after all.\r\n\r\n"Heavens, no!" said that excellent man who, himself, was incapable of\r\nany impropriety of conduct. "But it isn\'t a thing I would have done\r\nmyself; I mean even if I had not been married."\r\n\r\nThere was no implied condemnation in the statement; rather something\r\nlike regret. Davidson shared my suspicion that this was in its essence\r\nthe rescue of a distressed human being. Not that we were two romantics,\r\ntingeing the world to the hue of our temperament, but that both of us\r\nhad been acute enough to discover a long time ago that Heyst was.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have had the pluck," he continued. "I see a thing all\r\nround, as it were; but Heyst doesn\'t, or else he would have been scared.\r\nYou don\'t take a woman into a desert jungle without being made sorry for\r\nit sooner or later, in one way or another; and Heyst being a gentleman\r\nonly makes it worse."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\nWe said no more about Heyst on that occasion, and it so happened that\r\nI did not meet Davidson again for some three months. When we did come\r\ntogether, almost the first thing he said to me was:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen him."\r\n\r\nBefore I could exclaim, he assured me that he had taken no liberty,\r\nthat he had not intruded. He was called in. Otherwise he would not have\r\ndreamed of breaking in upon Heyst\'s privacy.\r\n\r\n"I am certain you wouldn\'t," I assured him, concealing my amusement at\r\nhis wonderful delicacy. He was the most delicate man that ever took a\r\nsmall steamer to and fro among the islands. But his humanity, which was\r\nnot less strong and praiseworthy, had induced him to take his\r\nsteamer past Samburan wharf (at an average distance of a mile) every\r\ntwenty-three days--exactly. Davidson was delicate, humane, and regular.\r\n\r\n"Heyst called you in?" I asked, interested.\r\n\r\nYes, Heyst had called him in as he was going by on his usual date.\r\nDavidson was examining the shore through his glasses with his unwearied\r\nand punctual humanity as he steamed past Samburan.\r\n\r\nI saw a man in white. It could only have been Heyst. He had fastened\r\nsome sort of enormous flag to a bamboo pole, and was waving it at the\r\nend of the old wharf.\r\n\r\nDavidson didn\'t like to take his steamer alongside--for fear of being\r\nindiscreet, I suppose; but he steered close inshore, stopped his\r\nengines, and lowered a boat. He went himself in that boat, which was\r\nmanned, of course, by his Malay seamen.\r\n\r\nHeyst, when he saw the boat pulling towards him, dropped his\r\nsignalling-pole; and when Davidson arrived, he was kneeling down engaged\r\nbusily in unfastening the flag from it.\r\n\r\n"Was there anything wrong?" I inquired, Davidson having paused in his\r\nnarrative and my curiosity being naturally aroused. You must remember\r\nthat Heyst as the Archipelago knew him was not--what shall I say--was\r\nnot a signalling sort of man.\r\n\r\n"The very words that came out of my mouth," said Davidson, "before I\r\nlaid the boat against the piles. I could not help it!"\r\n\r\nHeyst got up from his knees and began carefully folding up the flag\r\nthing, which struck Davidson as having the dimensions of a blanket.\r\n\r\n"No, nothing wrong," he cried. His white teeth flashed agreeably below\r\nthe coppery horizontal bar of his long moustaches.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know whether it was his delicacy or his obesity which prevented\r\nDavidson from clambering upon the wharf. He stood up in the boat,\r\nand, above him, Heyst stooped low with urbane smiles, thanking him and\r\napologizing for the liberty, exactly in his usual manner. Davidson had\r\nexpected some change in the man, but there was none. Nothing in him\r\nbetrayed the momentous fact that within that jungle there was a girl, a\r\nperformer in a ladies\' orchestra, whom he had carried straight off the\r\nconcert platform into the wilderness. He was not ashamed or defiant\r\nor abashed about it. He might have been a shade confidential when\r\naddressing Davidson. And his words were enigmatical.\r\n\r\n"I took this course of signalling to you," he said to Davidson, "because\r\nto preserve appearances might be of the utmost importance. Not to me, of\r\ncourse. I don\'t care what people may say, and of course no one can hurt\r\nme. I suppose I have done a certain amount of harm, since I allowed\r\nmyself to be tempted into action. It seemed innocent enough, but all\r\naction is bound to be harmful. It is devilish. That is why this world\r\nis evil upon the whole. But I have done with it! I shall never lift a\r\nlittle finger again. At one time I thought that intelligent observation\r\nof facts was the best way of cheating the time which is allotted to us\r\nwhether we want it or not; but now I, have done with observation, too."\r\n\r\nImagine poor, simple Davidson being addressed in such terms alongside\r\nan abandoned, decaying wharf jutting out of tropical bush. He had\r\nnever heard anybody speak like this before; certainly not Heyst, whose\r\nconversation was concise, polite, with a faint ring of playfulness in\r\nthe cultivated tones of his voice.\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone mad," Davidson thought to himself.\r\n\r\nBut, looking at the physiognomy above him on the wharf, he was obliged\r\nto dismiss the notion of common, crude lunacy. It was truly most unusual\r\ntalk. Then he remembered--in his surprise he had lost sight of it--that\r\nHeyst now had a girl there. This bizarre discourse was probably the\r\neffect of the girl. Davidson shook off the absurd feeling, and asked,\r\nwishing to make clear his friendliness, and not knowing what else to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t run short of stores or anything like that?"\r\n\r\nHeyst smiled and shook his head:\r\n\r\n"No, no. Nothing of the kind. We are fairly well off here. Thanks, all\r\nthe same. If I have taken the liberty to detain you, it is not from any\r\nuneasiness for myself and my--companion. The person I was thinking of\r\nwhen I made up my mind to invoke your assistance is Mrs. Schomberg."\r\n\r\n"I have talked with her," interjected Davidson.\r\n\r\n"Oh! You? Yes, I hoped she would find means to--"\r\n\r\n"But she didn\'t tell me much," interrupted Davidson, who was not averse\r\nfrom hearing something--he hardly knew what.\r\n\r\n"H\'m--Yes. But that note of mine? Yes? She found an opportunity to give\r\nit to you? That\'s good, very good. She\'s more resourceful than one would\r\ngive her credit for."\r\n\r\n"Women often are--" remarked Davidson. The strangeness from which he had\r\nsuffered, merely because his interlocutor had carried off a girl, wore\r\noff as the minutes went by. "There\'s a lot of unexpectedness about\r\nwomen," he generalized with a didactic aim which seemed to miss its\r\nmark; for the next thing Heyst said was:\r\n\r\n"This is Mrs. Schomberg\'s shawl." He touched the stuff hanging over\r\nhis arm. "An Indian thing, I believe," he added, glancing at his arm\r\nsideways.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t of particular value," said Davidson truthfully.\r\n\r\n"Very likely. The point is that it belongs to Schomberg\'s wife. That\r\nSchomberg seems to be an unconscionable ruffian--don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\nDavidson smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n"We out here have got used to him," he said, as if excusing a universal\r\nand guilty toleration of a manifest nuisance. "I\'d hardly call him that.\r\nI only know him as a hotel-keeper."\r\n\r\n"I never knew him even as that--not till this time, when you were so\r\nobliging as to take me to Sourabaya, I went to stay there from economy.\r\nThe Netherlands House is very expensive, and they expect you to bring\r\nyour own servant with you. It\'s a nuisance."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," protested Davidson hastily.\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence Heyst returned to the matter of the shawl. He\r\nwanted to send it back to Mrs. Schomberg. He said that it might be very\r\nawkward for her if she were unable, if asked, to produce it. This had\r\ngiven him, Heyst, much uneasiness. She was terrified of Schomberg.\r\nApparently she had reason to be.\r\n\r\nDavidson had remarked that, too. Which did not prevent her, he pointed\r\nout, from making a fool of him, in a way, for the sake of a stranger.\r\n\r\n"Oh! You know!" said Heyst. "Yes, she helped me--us."\r\n\r\n"She told me so. I had quite a talk with her," Davidson informed him.\r\n"Fancy anyone having a talk with Mrs. Schomberg! If I were to tell the\r\nfellows they wouldn\'t believe me. How did you get round her, Heyst?\r\nHow did you think of it? Why, she looks too stupid to understand human\r\nspeech and too scared to shoo a chicken away. Oh, the women, the women!\r\nYou don\'t know what there may be in the quietest of them."\r\n\r\n"She was engaged in the task of defending her position in life," said\r\nHeyst. "It\'s a very respectable task."\r\n\r\n"Is that it? I had some idea it was that," confessed Davidson.\r\n\r\nHe then imparted to Heyst the story of the violent proceedings following\r\non the discovery of his flight. Heyst\'s polite attention to the tale\r\ntook on a sombre cast; but he manifested no surprise, and offered no\r\ncomment. When Davidson had finished he handed down the shawl into\r\nthe boat, and Davidson promised to do his best to return it to Mrs.\r\nSchomberg in some secret fashion. Heyst expressed his thanks in a few\r\nsimple words, set off by his manner of finished courtesy. Davidson\r\nprepared to depart. They were not looking at each other. Suddenly Heyst\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n"You understand that this was a case of odious persecution, don\'t you? I\r\nbecame aware of it and--"\r\n\r\nIt was a view which the sympathetic Davidson was capable of\r\nappreciating.\r\n\r\n"I am not surprised to hear it," he said placidly. "Odious enough, I\r\ndare say. And you, of course--not being a married man--were free to step\r\nin. Ah, well!"\r\n\r\nHe sat down in the stern-sheets, and already had the steering lines in\r\nhis hands when Heyst observed abruptly:\r\n\r\n"The world is a bad dog. It will bite you if you give it a chance; but I\r\nthink that here we can safely defy the fates."\r\n\r\nWhen relating all this to me, Davidson\'s only comment was:\r\n\r\n"Funny notion of defying the fates--to take a woman in tow!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\nSome considerable time afterwards--we did not meet very often--I asked\r\nDavidson how he had managed about the shawl and heard that he had\r\ntackled his mission in a direct way, and had found it easy enough. At\r\nthe very first call he made in Samarang he rolled the shawl as tightly\r\nas he could into the smallest possible brown-paper parcel, which he\r\ncarried ashore with him. His business in the town being transacted,\r\nhe got into a gharry with the parcel and drove to the hotel. With his\r\nprecious experience, he timed his arrival accurately for the hour of\r\nSchomberg\'s siesta. Finding the place empty as on the former occasion,\r\nhe marched into the billiard-room, took a seat at the back, near the\r\nsort of dais which Mrs. Schomberg would in due course come to occupy,\r\nand broke the slumbering silence of the house by thumping a bell\r\nvigorously. Of course a Chinaman appeared promptly. Davidson ordered a\r\ndrink and sat tight.\r\n\r\n"I would have ordered twenty drinks one after another, if necessary,"\r\nhe said--Davidson\'s a very abstemious man--"rather than take that parcel\r\nout of the house again. Couldn\'t leave it in a corner without letting\r\nthe woman know it was there. It might have turned out worse for her than\r\nnot bringing the thing back at all."\r\n\r\nAnd so he waited, ringing the bell again and again, and swallowing two\r\nor three iced drinks which he did not want. Presently, as he hoped it\r\nwould happen, Mrs. Schomberg came in, silk dress, long neck, ringlets,\r\nscared eyes, and silly grin--all complete. Probably that lazy beast had\r\nsent her out to see who was the thirsty customer waking up the echoes of\r\nthe house at this quiet hour. Bow, nod--and she clambered up to her post\r\nbehind the raised counter, looking so helpless, so inane, as she sat\r\nthere, that if it hadn\'t been for the parcel, Davidson declared, he\r\nwould have thought he had merely dreamed all that had passed between\r\nthem. He ordered another drink, to get the Chinaman out of the room, and\r\nthen seized the parcel, which was reposing on a chair near him, and\r\nwith no more than a mutter--"this is something of yours"--he rammed it\r\nswiftly into a recess in the counter, at her feet. There! The rest\r\nwas her affair. And just in time, too. Schomberg turned up, yawning\r\naffectedly, almost before Davidson had regained his seat. He cast about\r\nsuspicious and irate glances. An invincible placidity of expression\r\nhelped Davidson wonderfully at the moment, and the other, of course,\r\ncould have no grounds for the slightest suspicion of any sort of\r\nunderstanding between his wife and this customer.\r\n\r\nAs to Mrs. Schomberg, she sat there like a joss. Davidson was lost in\r\nadmiration. He believed, now, that the woman had been putting it on\r\nfor years. She never even winked. It was immense! The insight he had\r\nobtained almost frightened him; he couldn\'t get over his wonder at\r\nknowing more of the real Mrs. Schomberg than anybody in the Islands,\r\nincluding Schomberg himself. She was a miracle of dissimulation. No\r\nwonder Heyst got the girl away from under two men\'s noses, if he had her\r\nto help with the job!\r\n\r\nThe greatest wonder, after all, was Heyst getting mixed up with\r\npetticoats. The fellow\'s life had been open to us for years and nothing\r\ncould have been more detached from feminine associations. Except that he\r\nstood drinks to people on suitable occasions, like any other man, this\r\nobserver of facts seemed to have no connection with earthly affairs and\r\npassions. The very courtesy of his manner, the flavour of playfulness in\r\nthe voice set him apart. He was like a feather floating lightly in\r\nthe workaday atmosphere which was the breath of our nostrils. For this\r\nreason whenever this looker-on took contact with things he attracted\r\nattention. First, it was the Morrison partnership of mystery, then\r\ncame the great sensation of the Tropical Belt Coal where indeed varied\r\ninterests were involved: a real business matter. And then came this\r\nelopement, this incongruous phenomenon of self-assertion, the greatest\r\nwonder of all, astonishing and amusing.\r\n\r\nDavidson admitted to me that, the hubbub was subsiding; and the affair\r\nwould have been already forgotten, perhaps, if that ass Schomberg\r\nhad not kept on gnashing his teeth publicly about it. It was really\r\nprovoking that Davidson should not be able to give one some idea of the\r\ngirl. Was she pretty? He didn\'t know. He had stayed the whole afternoon\r\nin Schomberg\'s hotel, mainly for the purpose of finding out something\r\nabout her. But the story was growing stale. The parties at the tables on\r\nthe veranda had other, fresher, events to talk about and Davidson shrank\r\nfrom making direct inquiries. He sat placidly there, content to be\r\ndisregarded and hoping for some chance word to turn up. I shouldn\'t\r\nwonder if the good fellow hadn\'t been dozing. It\'s difficult to give you\r\nan adequate idea of Davidson\'s placidity.\r\n\r\nPresently Schomberg, wandering about, joined a party that had taken the\r\ntable next to Davidson\'s.\r\n\r\n"A man like that Swede, gentlemen, is a public danger," he began. "I\r\nremember him for years. I won\'t say anything of his spying--well, he\r\nused to say himself he was looking for out-of-the-way facts and what is\r\nthat if not spying? He was spying into everybody\'s business. He got hold\r\nof Captain Morrison, squeezed him dry, like you would an orange, and\r\nscared him off to Europe to die there. Everybody knows that Captain\r\nMorrison had a weak chest. Robbed first and murdered afterwards! I don\'t\r\nmince words--not I. Next he gets up that swindle of the Belt Coal. You\r\nknow all about it. And now, after lining his pockets with other people\'s\r\nmoney, he kidnaps a white girl belonging to an orchestra which is\r\nperforming in my public room for the benefit of my patrons, and goes\r\noff to live like a prince on that island, where nobody can get at him. A\r\ndamn silly girl . . . It\'s disgusting--tfui!"\r\n\r\nHe spat. He choked with rage--for he saw visions, no doubt. He jumped up\r\nfrom his chair, and went away to flee from them--perhaps. He went into\r\nthe room where Mrs. Schomberg sat. Her aspect could not have been very\r\nsoothing to the sort of torment from which he was suffering.\r\n\r\nDavidson did not feel called upon to defend Heyst. His proceeding was to\r\nenter into conversation with one and another, casually, and showing no\r\nparticular knowledge of the affair, in order to discover something about\r\nthe girl. Was she anything out of the way? Was she pretty? She couldn\'t\r\nhave been markedly so. She had not attracted special notice. She was\r\nyoung--on that everybody agreed. The English clerk of Tesmans remembered\r\nthat she had a sallow face. He was respectable and highly proper. He\r\nwas not the sort to associate with such people. Most of these women were\r\nfairly battered specimens. Schomberg had them housed in what he called\r\nthe Pavilion, in the grounds, where they were hard at it mending and\r\nwashing their white dresses, and could be seen hanging them out to dry\r\nbetween the trees, like a lot of washerwomen. They looked very much\r\nlike middle-aged washerwomen on the platform, too. But the girl had\r\nbeen living in the main building along with the boss, the director, the\r\nfellow with the black beard, and a hard-bitten, oldish woman who took\r\nthe piano and was understood to be the fellow\'s wife.\r\n\r\nThis was not a very satisfactory result. Davidson stayed on, and even\r\njoined the table d\'hote dinner, without gleaning any more information.\r\nHe was resigned.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," he wheezed placidly, "I am bound to see her some day."\r\n\r\nHe meant to take the Samburan channel every trip, as before of course.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "No doubt you will. Some day Heyst will be signalling to\r\nyou again; and I wonder what it will be for."\r\n\r\nDavidson made no reply. He had his own ideas about that, and his silence\r\nconcealed a good deal of thought. We spoke no more of Heyst\'s girl.\r\nBefore we separated, he gave me a piece of unrelated observation.\r\n\r\n"It\'s funny," he said, "but I fancy there\'s some gambling going on\r\nin the evening at Schomberg\'s place, on the quiet. I\'ve noticed men\r\nstrolling away in twos and threes towards that hall where the orchestra\r\nused to play. The windows must be specially well shuttered, because I\r\ncould not spy the smallest gleam of light from that direction; but I\r\ncan\'t believe that those beggars would go in there only to sit and think\r\nof their sins in the dark."\r\n\r\n"That\'s strange. It\'s incredible that Schomberg should risk that sort of\r\nthing," I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\nAs we know, Heyst had gone to stay in Schomberg\'s hotel in complete\r\nignorance that his person was odious to that worthy. When he arrived,\r\nZangiacomo\'s Ladies\' Orchestra had been established there for some time.\r\n\r\nThe business which had called him out from his seclusion in his lost\r\ncorner of the Eastern seas was with the Tesmans, and it had something\r\nto do with money. He transacted it quickly, and then found himself with\r\nnothing to do while he awaited Davidson, who was to take him back to his\r\nsolitude; for back to his solitude Heyst meant to go. He whom we used\r\nto refer to as the Enchanted Heyst was suffering from thorough\r\ndisenchantment. Not with the islands, however. The Archipelago has a\r\nlasting fascination. It is not easy to shake off the spell of island\r\nlife. Heyst was disenchanted with life as a whole. His scornful\r\ntemperament, beguiled into action, suffered from failure in a subtle way\r\nunknown to men accustomed to grapple with the realities of common human\r\nenterprise. It was like the gnawing pain of useless apostasy, a sort of\r\nshame before his own betrayed nature; and in addition, he also suffered\r\nfrom plain, downright remorse. He deemed himself guilty of Morrison\'s\r\ndeath. A rather absurd feeling, since no one could possibly have\r\nforeseen the horrors of the cold, wet summer lying in wait for poor\r\nMorrison at home.\r\n\r\nIt was not in Heyst\'s character to turn morose; but his mental state was\r\nnot compatible with a sociable mood. He spent his evenings sitting\r\napart on the veranda of Schomberg\'s hotel. The lamentations of string\r\ninstruments issued from the building in the hotel compound, the\r\napproaches to which were decorated with Japanese paper lanterns strung\r\nup between the trunks of several big trees. Scraps of tunes more or\r\nless plaintive reached his ears. They pursued him even into his bedroom,\r\nwhich opened into an upstairs veranda. The fragmentary and rasping\r\ncharacter of these sounds made their intrusion inexpressibly tedious in\r\nthe long run. Like most dreamers, to whom it is given sometimes to hear\r\nthe music of the spheres, Heyst, the wanderer of the Archipelago, had\r\na taste for silence which he had been able to gratify for years. The\r\nislands are very quiet. One sees them lying about, clothed in their dark\r\ngarments of leaves, in a great hush of silver and azure, where the sea\r\nwithout murmurs meets the sky in a ring of magic stillness. A sort of\r\nsmiling somnolence broods over them; the very voices of their people are\r\nsoft and subdued, as if afraid to break some protecting spell.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was the very spell which had enchanted Heyst in the early\r\ndays. For him, however, that was broken. He was no longer enchanted,\r\nthough he was still a captive of the islands. He had no intention to\r\nleave them ever. Where could he have gone to, after all these years?\r\nNot a single soul belonging to him lived anywhere on earth. Of this\r\nfact--not such a remote one, after all--he had only lately become aware;\r\nfor it is failure that makes a man enter into himself and reckon up his\r\nresources. And though he had made up his mind to retire from the world\r\nin hermit fashion, yet he was irrationally moved by this sense of\r\nloneliness which had come to him in the hour of renunciation. It hurt\r\nhim. Nothing is more painful than the shock of sharp contradictions that\r\nlacerate our intelligence and our feelings.\r\n\r\nMeantime Schomberg watched Heyst out of the corner of his eye.\r\nTowards the unconscious object of his enmity he preserved a distant\r\nlieutenant-of-the-Reserve demeanour. Nudging certain of his customers\r\nwith his elbow, he begged them to observe what airs "that Swede" was\r\ngiving himself.\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know why he has come to stay in my house. This place\r\nisn\'t good enough for him. I wish to goodness he had gone somewhere else\r\nto show off his superiority. Here I have got up this series of concerts\r\nfor you gentlemen, just to make things a little brighter generally; and\r\ndo you think he\'ll condescend to step in and listen to a piece or two of\r\nan evening? Not he. I know him of old. There he sits at the dark end of\r\nthe piazza, all the evening long--planning some new swindle, no doubt.\r\nFor two-pence I would ask him to go and look for quarters somewhere\r\nelse; only one doesn\'t like to treat a white man like that out in the\r\ntropics. I don\'t know how long he means to stay, but I\'m willing to bet\r\na trifle that he\'ll never work himself up to the point of spending the\r\nfifty cents of entrance money for the sake of a little good music."\r\n\r\nNobody cared to bet, or the hotel-keeper would have lost. One evening\r\nHeyst was driven to desperation by the rasped, squeaked, scraped\r\nsnatches of tunes pursuing him even to his hard couch, with a mattress\r\nas thin as a pancake and a diaphanous mosquito net. He descended among\r\nthe trees, where the soft glow of Japanese lanterns picked out parts of\r\ntheir great rugged trunks, here and there, in the great mass of darkness\r\nunder the lofty foliage. More lanterns, of the shape of cylindrical\r\nconcertinas, hanging in a row from a slack string, decorated the doorway\r\nof what Schomberg called grandiloquently "my concert-hall." In his\r\ndesperate mood Heyst ascended three steps, lifted a calico curtain, and\r\nwent in.\r\n\r\nThe uproar in that small, barn-like structure, built of imported\r\npine boards, and raised clear of the ground, was simply stunning. An\r\ninstrumental uproar, screaming, grunting, whining, sobbing, scraping,\r\nsqueaking some kind of lively air; while a grand piano, operated upon\r\nby a bony, red-faced woman with bad-tempered nostrils, rained hard notes\r\nlike hail through the tempest of fiddles. The small platform was filled\r\nwith white muslin dresses and crimson sashes slanting from shoulders\r\nprovided with bare arms, which sawed away without respite. Zangiacomo\r\nconducted. He wore a white mess-jacket, a black dress waistcoat, and\r\nwhite trousers. His longish, tousled hair and his great beard were\r\npurple-black. He was horrible. The heat was terrific. There were perhaps\r\nthirty people having drinks at several little tables. Heyst, quite\r\novercome by the volume of noise, dropped into a chair. In the quick time\r\nof that music, in the varied, piercing clamour of the strings, in the\r\nmovements of the bare arms, in the low dresses, the coarse faces,\r\nthe stony eyes of the executants, there was a suggestion of\r\nbrutality--something cruel, sensual and repulsive.\r\n\r\n"This is awful!" Heyst murmured to himself.\r\n\r\nBut there is an unholy fascination in systematic noise. He did not\r\nflee from it incontinently, as one might have expected him to do. He\r\nremained, astonished at himself for remaining, since nothing could have\r\nbeen more repulsive to his tastes, more painful to his senses, and,\r\nso to speak, more contrary to his genius, than this rude exhibition\r\nof vigour. The Zangiacomo band was not making music; it was simply\r\nmurdering silence with a vulgar, ferocious energy. One felt as if\r\nwitnessing a deed of violence; and that impression was so strong that it\r\nseemed marvellous to see the people sitting so quietly on their\r\nchairs, drinking so calmly out of their glasses, and giving no signs\r\nof distress, anger, or fear. Heyst averted his gaze from the unnatural\r\nspectacle of their indifference.\r\n\r\nWhen the piece of music came to an end the relief was so great that he\r\nfelt slightly dizzy, as if a chasm of silence had yawned at his feet.\r\nWhen he raised his eyes, the audience, most perversely, was exhibiting\r\nsigns of animation and interest in their faces, and the women in white\r\nmuslin dresses were coming down in pairs from the platform into the body\r\nof Schomberg\'s "concert-hall." They dispersed themselves all over the\r\nplace. The male creature with the hooked nose and purple-black beard\r\ndisappeared somewhere. This was the interval during which, as the astute\r\nSchomberg had stipulated, the members of the orchestra were encouraged\r\nto favour the members of the audience with their company--that is, such\r\nmembers as seemed inclined to fraternize with the arts in a familiar and\r\ngenerous manner; the symbol of familiarity and generosity consisting in\r\noffers of refreshment.\r\n\r\nThe procedure struck Heyst as highly incorrect. However, the impropriety\r\nof Schomberg\'s ingenious scheme was defeated by the circumstance that\r\nmost of the women were no longer young, and that none of them had ever\r\nbeen beautiful. Their more or less worn cheeks were slightly rouged, but\r\napart from that fact, which might have been simply a matter of routine,\r\nthey did not seem to take the success of the scheme unduly to heart.\r\nThe impulse to fraternize with the arts being obviously weak in the\r\naudience, some of the musicians sat down listlessly at unoccupied\r\ntables, while others went on perambulating the central passage: arm in\r\narm, glad enough, no doubt, to stretch their legs while resting their\r\narms. Their crimson sashes gave a factitious touch of gaiety to the\r\nsmoky atmosphere of the concert-hall; and Heyst felt a sudden pity for\r\nthese beings, exploited, hopeless, devoid of charm and grace, whose fate\r\nof cheerless dependence invested their coarse and joyless features with\r\na touch of pathos.\r\n\r\nHeyst was temperamentally sympathetic. To have them passing and\r\nrepassing close to his little table was painful to him. He was preparing\r\nto rise and go out when he noticed that two white muslin dresses and\r\ncrimson sashes had not yet left the platform. One of these dresses\r\nconcealed the raw-boned frame of the woman with the bad-tempered curve\r\nto her nostrils. She was no less a personage than Mrs. Zangiacomo. She\r\nhad left the piano, and, with her back to the hall, was preparing the\r\nparts for the second half of the concert, with a brusque, impatient\r\naction of her ugly elbow. This task done, she turned, and, perceiving\r\nthe other white muslin dress motionless on a chair in the second row,\r\nshe strode towards it between the music-stands with an aggressive and\r\nmasterful gait. On the lap of that dress there lay, unclasped and idle,\r\na pair of small hands, not very white, attached to well-formed arms.\r\nThe next detail Heyst was led to observe was the arrangement of the\r\nhair--two thick, brown tresses rolled round an attractively shaped head.\r\n\r\n"A girl, by Jove!" he exclaimed mentally.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that she was a girl. It was evident in the outline of the\r\nshoulders, in the slender white bust springing up, barred slantwise by\r\nthe crimson sash, from the bell-shaped spread of muslin skirt hiding the\r\nchair on which she sat averted a little from the body of the hall. Her\r\nfeet, in low white shoes, were crossed prettily.\r\n\r\nShe had captured Heyst\'s awakened faculty of observation; he had\r\nthe sensation of a new experience. That was because his faculty of\r\nobservation had never before been captured by any feminine creature in\r\nthat marked and exclusive fashion. He looked at her anxiously, as no man\r\never looks at another man; and he positively forgot where he was. He had\r\nlost touch with his surroundings. The big woman, advancing, concealed\r\nthe girl from his sight for a moment. She bent over the seated youthful\r\nfigure, in passing it very close, as if to drop a word into its ear.\r\nHer lips did certainly move. But what sort of word could it have been\r\nto make the girl jump up so swiftly? Heyst, at his table, was surprised\r\ninto a sympathetic start. He glanced quickly round. Nobody was looking\r\ntowards the platform; and when his eyes swept back there again, the\r\ngirl, with the big woman treading at her heels, was coming down the\r\nthree steps from the platform to the floor of the hall. There she\r\npaused, stumbled one pace forward, and stood still again, while\r\nthe other--the escort, the dragoon, the coarse big woman of the\r\npiano--passed her roughly, and, marching truculently down the centre\r\naisle between the chairs and tables, went out to rejoin the hook-nosed\r\nZangiacomo somewhere outside. During her extraordinary transit, as if\r\neverything in the hall were dirt under her feet, her scornful eyes met\r\nthe upward glance of Heyst, who looked away at once towards the girl.\r\nShe had not moved. Her arms hung down; her eyelids were lowered.\r\n\r\nHeyst laid down his half-smoked cigar and compressed his lips. Then he\r\ngot up. It was the same sort of impulse which years ago had made him\r\ncross the sandy street of the abominable town of Delli in the island of\r\nTimor and accost Morrison, practically a stranger to him then, a man in\r\ntrouble, expressively harassed, dejected, lonely.\r\n\r\nIt was the same impulse. But he did not recognize it. He was not\r\nthinking of Morrison then. It may be said that, for the first time\r\nsince the final abandonment of the Samburan coal mine, he had completely\r\nforgotten the late Morrison. It is true that to a certain extent he\r\nhad forgotten also where he was. Thus, unchecked by any sort of self\r\nconsciousness, Heyst walked up the central passage.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the women, by this time, had found anchorage here and there\r\namong the occupied tables. They talked to the men, leaning on their\r\nelbows, and suggesting funnily--if it hadn\'t been for the crimson\r\nsashes--in their white dresses an assembly of middle-aged brides\r\nwith free and easy manners and hoarse voices. The murmuring noise\r\nof conversations carried on with some spirit filled Schomberg\'s\r\nconcert-room. Nobody remarked Heyst\'s movements; for indeed he was not\r\nthe only man on his legs there. He had been confronting the girl for\r\nsome time before she became aware of his presence. She was looking down,\r\nvery still, without colour, without glances, without voice, without\r\nmovement. It was only when Heyst addressed her in his courteous tone\r\nthat she raised her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," he said in English, "but that horrible female has done\r\nsomething to you. She has pinched you, hasn\'t she? I am sure she pinched\r\nyou just now, when she stood by your chair."\r\n\r\nThe girl received this overture with the wide, motionless stare of\r\nprofound astonishment. Heyst, vexed with himself, suspected that she did\r\nnot understand what he said. One could not tell what nationality these\r\nwomen were, except that they were of all sorts. But she was astonished\r\nalmost more by the near presence of the man himself, by his largely\r\nbald head, by the white brow, the sunburnt cheeks, the long, horizontal\r\nmoustaches of crinkly bronze hair, by the kindly expression of the man\'s\r\nblue eyes looking into her own. He saw the stony amazement in hers\r\ngive way to a momentary alarm, which was succeeded by an expression of\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n"I am sure she pinched your arm most cruelly," he murmured, rather\r\ndisconcerted now at what he had done.\r\n\r\nIt was a great comfort to hear her say:\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t have been the first time. And suppose she did--what are you\r\ngoing to do about it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he said with a faint, remote playfulness in his tone\r\nwhich had not been heard in it lately, and which seemed to catch her\r\near pleasantly. "I am grieved to say that I don\'t know. But can I do\r\nanything? What would you wish me to do? Pray command me."\r\n\r\nAgain, the greatest astonishment became visible in her face; for she now\r\nperceived how different he was from the other men in the room. He was as\r\ndifferent from them as she was different from the other members of the\r\nladies\' orchestra.\r\n\r\n"Command you?" she breathed, after a time, in a bewildered tone. "Who\r\nare you?" she asked a little louder.\r\n\r\n"I am staying in this hotel for a few days. I just dropped in casually\r\nhere. This outrage--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you try to interfere," she said so earnestly that Heyst asked, in\r\nhis faintly playful tone:\r\n\r\n"Is it your wish that I should leave you?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said that," the girl answered. "She pinched me because I\r\ndidn\'t get down here quick enough--"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you how indignant I am--" said Heyst. "But since you are\r\ndown here now," he went on, with the ease of a man of the world speaking\r\nto a young lady in a drawing-room, "hadn\'t we better sit down?"\r\n\r\nShe obeyed his inviting gesture, and they sat down on the nearest\r\nchairs. They looked at each other across a little round table with a\r\nsurprised, open gaze, self-consciousness growing on them so slowly that\r\nit was a long time before they averted their eyes; and very soon they\r\nmet again, temporarily, only to rebound, as it were. At last they\r\nsteadied in contact, but by that time, say some fifteen minutes from the\r\nmoment when they sat down, the "interval" came to an end.\r\n\r\nSo much for their eyes. As to the conversation, it had been perfectly\r\ninsignificant because naturally they had nothing to say to each other.\r\nHeyst had been interested by the girl\'s physiognomy. Its expression was\r\nneither simple nor yet very clear. It was not distinguished--that could\r\nnot be expected--but the features had more fineness than those of any\r\nother feminine countenance he had ever had the opportunity to observe so\r\nclosely. There was in it something indefinably audacious and infinitely\r\nmiserable--because the temperament and the existence of that girl were\r\nreflected in it. But her voice! It seduced Heyst by its amazing quality.\r\nIt was a voice fit to utter the most exquisite things, a voice which\r\nwould have made silly chatter supportable and the roughest talk\r\nfascinating. Heyst drank in its charm as one listens to the tone of some\r\ninstrument without heeding the tune.\r\n\r\n"Do you sing as well as play?" he asked her abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Never sang a note in my life," she said, obviously surprised by the\r\nirrelevant question; for they had not been discoursing of sweet sounds.\r\nShe was clearly unaware of her voice. "I don\'t remember that I ever had\r\nmuch reason to sing since I was little," she added.\r\n\r\nThat inelegant phrase, by the mere vibrating, warm nobility of the\r\nsound, found its way into Heyst\'s heart. His mind, cool, alert, watched\r\nit sink there with a sort of vague concern at the absurdity of\r\nthe occupation, till it rested at the bottom, deep down, where our\r\nunexpressed longings lie.\r\n\r\n"You are English, of course?" he said.\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" she answered in the most charming accents. Then, as\r\nif thinking that it was her turn to place a question: "Why do you always\r\nsmile when you speak?"\r\n\r\nIt was enough to make anyone look grave, but her good faith was so\r\nevident that Heyst recovered himself at once.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my unfortunate manner--" he said with his delicate, polished\r\nplayfulness. "Is is very objectionable to you?"\r\n\r\nShe was very serious.\r\n\r\n"No. I only noticed it. I haven\'t come across so many pleasant people as\r\nall that, in my life."\r\n\r\n"It\'s certain that this woman who plays the piano is infinitely more\r\ndisagreeable than any cannibal I have ever had to do with."\r\n\r\n"I believe you!" She shuddered. "How did you come to have anything to do\r\nwith cannibals?"\r\n\r\n"It would be too long a tale," said Heyst with a faint smile. Heyst\'s\r\nsmiles were rather melancholy, and accorded badly with his great\r\nmoustaches, under which his mere playfulness lurked as comfortable as a\r\nshy bird in its native thicket. "Much too long. How did you get amongst\r\nthis lot here?"\r\n\r\n"Bad luck," she answered briefly.\r\n\r\n"No doubt, no doubt," Heyst assented with slight nods. Then, still\r\nindignant at the pinch which he had divined rather than actually seen\r\ninflicted: "I say, couldn\'t you defend yourself somehow?"\r\n\r\nShe had risen already. The ladies of the orchestra were slowly regaining\r\ntheir places. Some were already seated, idle stony-eyed, before the\r\nmusic-stands. Heyst was standing up, too.\r\n\r\n"They are too many for me," she said.\r\n\r\nThese few words came out of the common experience of mankind; yet by\r\nvirtue of her voice, they thrilled Heyst like a revelation. His feelings\r\nwere in a state of confusion, but his mind was clear.\r\n\r\n"That\'s bad. But it isn\'t actual ill-usage that this girl is complaining\r\nof," he thought lucidly after she left him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nThat was how it began. How it was that it ended, as we know it did end,\r\nis not so easy to state precisely. It is very clear that Heyst was not\r\nindifferent, I won\'t say to the girl, but to the girl\'s fate. He was\r\nthe same man who had plunged after the submerged Morrison whom he\r\nhardly knew otherwise than by sight and through the usual gossip of the\r\nislands. But this was another sort of plunge altogether, and likely to\r\nlead to a very different kind of partnership.\r\n\r\nDid he reflect at all? Probably. He was sufficiently reflective. But\r\nif he did, it was with insufficient knowledge. For there is no evidence\r\nthat he paused at any time between the date of that evening and the\r\nmorning of the flight. Truth to say, Heyst was not one of those men\r\nwho pause much. Those dreamy spectators of the world\'s agitation are\r\nterrible once the desire to act gets hold of them. They lower their\r\nheads and charge a wall with an amazing serenity which nothing but an\r\nindisciplined imagination can give.\r\n\r\nHe was not a fool. I suppose he knew--or at least he felt--where this\r\nwas leading him. But his complete inexperience gave him the necessary\r\naudacity. The girl\'s voice was charming when she spoke to him of her\r\nmiserable past, in simple terms, with a sort of unconscious cynicism\r\ninherent in the truth of the ugly conditions of poverty. And whether\r\nbecause he was humane or because her voice included all the modulations\r\nof pathos, cheerfulness, and courage in its compass, it was not disgust\r\nthat the tale awakened in him, but the sense of an immense sadness.\r\n\r\nOn a later evening, during the interval between the two parts of the\r\nconcert, the girl told Heyst about herself. She was almost a child\r\nof the streets. Her father was a musician in the orchestras of small\r\ntheatres. Her mother ran away from him while she was little, and the\r\nlandladies of various poor lodging-houses had attended casually to her\r\nabandoned childhood. It was never positive starvation and absolute rags,\r\nbut it was the hopeless grip of poverty all the time. It was her father\r\nwho taught her to play the violin. It seemed that he used to get drunk\r\nsometimes, but without pleasure, and only because he was unable to\r\nforget his fugitive wife. After he had a paralytic stroke, falling\r\nover with a crash in the well of a music-hall orchestra during the\r\nperformance, she had joined the Zangiacomo company. He was now in a home\r\nfor incurables.\r\n\r\n"And I am here," she finished, "with no one to care if I make a hole in\r\nthe water the next chance I get or not."\r\n\r\nHeyst told her that he thought she could do a little better than that,\r\nif it was only a question of getting out of the world. She looked at him\r\nwith special attention, and with a puzzled expression which gave to her\r\nface an air of innocence.\r\n\r\nThis was during one of the "intervals" between the two parts of the\r\nconcert. She had come down that time without being incited thereto by a\r\npinch from the awful Zangiacomo woman. It is difficult to suppose that\r\nshe was seduced by the uncovered intellectual forehead and the long\r\nreddish moustaches of her new friend. New is not the right word. She had\r\nnever had a friend before; and the sensation of this friendliness going\r\nout to her was exciting by its novelty alone. Besides, any man who did\r\nnot resemble Schomberg appeared for that very reason attractive. She was\r\nafraid of the hotel-keeper, who, in the daytime, taking advantage of the\r\nfact that she lived in the hotel itself, and not in the Pavilion with\r\nthe other "artists" prowled round her, mute, hungry, portentous behind\r\nhis great beard, or else assailed her in quiet corners and empty\r\npassages with deep, mysterious murmurs from behind, which, not\r\nwithstanding their clear import, sounded horribly insane somehow.\r\n\r\nThe contrast of Heyst\'s quiet, polished manner gave her special delight\r\nand filled her with admiration. She had never seen anything like that\r\nbefore. If she had, perhaps, known kindness in her life, she had never\r\nmet the forms of simple courtesy. She was interested by it as a very\r\nnovel experience, not very intelligible, but distinctly pleasurable.\r\n\r\n"I tell you they are too many for me," she repeated, sometimes\r\nrecklessly, but more often shaking her head with ominous dejection.\r\n\r\nShe had, of course, no money at all. The quantities of "black men" all\r\nabout frightened her. She really had no definite idea where she was on\r\nthe surface of the globe. The orchestra was generally taken from the\r\nsteamer to some hotel, and kept shut up there till it was time to go on\r\nboard another steamer. She could not remember the names she heard.\r\n\r\n"How do you call this place again?" she used to ask Heyst.\r\n\r\n"Sourabaya," he would say distinctly, and would watch the discouragement\r\nat the outlandish sound coming into her eyes, which were fastened on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHe could not defend himself from compassion. He suggested that she might\r\ngo to the consul, but it was his conscience that dictated this advice,\r\nnot his conviction. She had never heard of the animal or of its uses. A\r\nconsul! What was it? Who was he? What could he do? And when she learned\r\nthat perhaps he could be induced to send her home, her head dropped on\r\nher breast.\r\n\r\n"What am I to do when I get there?" she murmured with an intonation so\r\njust, with an accent so penetrating--the charm of her voice did not fail\r\nher even in whispering--that Heyst seemed to see the illusion of human\r\nfellowship on earth vanish before the naked truth of her existence, and\r\nleave them both face to face in a moral desert as arid as the sands of\r\nSahara, without restful shade, without refreshing water.\r\n\r\nShe leaned slightly over the little table, the same little table at\r\nwhich they had sat when they first met each other; and with no other\r\nmemories but of the stones in the streets her childhood had known, in\r\nthe distress of the incoherent, confused, rudimentary impressions of her\r\ntravels inspiring her with a vague terror of the world she said rapidly,\r\nas one speaks in desperation:\r\n\r\n"You do something! You are a gentleman. It wasn\'t I who spoke to you\r\nfirst, was it? I didn\'t begin, did I? It was you who came along and\r\nspoke to me when I was standing over there. What did you want to speak\r\nto me for? I don\'t care what it is, but you must do something."\r\n\r\nHer attitude was fierce and entreating at the same time--clamorous, in\r\nfact though her voice had hardly risen above a breath. It was clamorous\r\nenough to be noticed. Heyst, on purpose, laughed aloud. She nearly\r\nchoked with indignation at this brutal heartlessness.\r\n\r\n"What did you mean, then, by saying \'command me!\'?" she almost hissed.\r\n\r\nSomething hard in his mirthless stare, and a quiet final "All right,"\r\nsteadied her.\r\n\r\n"I am not rich enough to buy you out," he went on, speaking with an\r\nextraordinary detached grin, "even if it were to be done; but I can\r\nalways steal you."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him profoundly, as though these words had a hidden and\r\nvery complicated meaning.\r\n\r\n"Get away now," he said rapidly, "and try to smile as you go."\r\n\r\nShe obeyed with unexpected readiness; and as she had a set of very good\r\nwhite teeth, the effect of the mechanical, ordered smile was joyous,\r\nradiant. It astonished Heyst. No wonder, it flashed through his mind,\r\nwomen can deceive men so completely. The faculty was inherent in them;\r\nthey seemed to be created with a special aptitude. Here was a smile\r\nthe origin of which was well known to him; and yet it had conveyed a\r\nsensation of warmth, had given him a sort of ardour to live which was\r\nvery new to his experience.\r\n\r\nBy this time she was gone from the table, and had joined the other\r\n"ladies of the orchestra." They trooped towards the platform, driven in\r\ntruculently by the haughty mate of Zangiacomo, who looked as though\r\nshe were restraining herself with difficulty from punching their backs.\r\nZangiacomo followed, with his great, pendulous dyed beard and short\r\nmess-jacket, with an aspect of hang-dog concentration imparted by his\r\ndrooping head and the uneasiness of his eyes, which were set very close\r\ntogether. He climbed the steps last of all, turned about, displaying\r\nhis purple beard to the hall, and tapped with his bow. Heyst winced in\r\nanticipation of the horrible racket. It burst out immediately unabashed\r\nand awful. At the end of the platform the woman at the piano, presenting\r\nher cruel profile, her head tilted back, banged the keys without looking\r\nat the music.\r\n\r\nHeyst could not stand the uproar for more than a minute. He went out,\r\nhis brain racked by the rhythm of some more or less Hungarian dance\r\nmusic. The forests inhabited by the New Guinea cannibals where he had\r\nencountered the most exciting of his earlier futile adventures were\r\nsilent. And this adventure, not in its execution, perhaps, but in its\r\nnature, required even more nerve than anything he had faced before.\r\nWalking among the paper lanterns suspended to trees he remembered with\r\nregret the gloom and the dead stillness of the forests at the back of\r\nGeelvink Bay, perhaps the wildest, the unsafest, the most deadly spot\r\non earth from which the sea can be seen. Oppressed by his thoughts,\r\nhe sought the obscurity and peace of his bedroom; but they were not\r\ncomplete. The distant sounds of the concert reached his ear, faint\r\nindeed, but still disturbing. Neither did he feel very safe in there;\r\nfor that sentiment depends not on extraneous circumstances but on our\r\ninward conviction. He did not attempt to go to sleep; he did not even\r\nunbutton the top button of his tunic. He sat in a chair and mused.\r\nFormerly, in solitude and in silence, he had been used to think clearly\r\nand sometimes even profoundly, seeing life outside the flattering\r\noptical delusion of everlasting hope, of conventional self-deceptions,\r\nof an ever-expected happiness. But now he was troubled; a light veil\r\nseemed to hang before his mental vision; the awakening of a tenderness,\r\nindistinct and confused as yet, towards an unknown woman.\r\n\r\nGradually silence, a real silence, had established itself round him. The\r\nconcert was over; the audience had gone; the concert-hall was dark; and\r\neven the Pavilion, where the ladies\' orchestra slept after its noisy\r\nlabours, showed not a gleam of light. Heyst suddenly felt restless in\r\nall his limbs, as this reaction from the long immobility would not be\r\ndenied, he humoured it by passing quietly along the back veranda and out\r\ninto the grounds at the side of the house, into the black shadows under\r\nthe trees, where the extinguished paper lanterns were gently swinging\r\ntheir globes like withered fruit.\r\n\r\nHe paced there to and fro for a long time, a calm, meditative ghost in\r\nhis white drill-suit, revolving in his head thoughts absolutely novel,\r\ndisquieting, and seductive; accustoming his mind to the contemplation\r\nof his purpose, in order that by being faced steadily it should appear\r\npraiseworthy and wise. For the use of reason is to justify the obscure\r\ndesires that move our conduct, impulses, passions, prejudices, and\r\nfollies, and also our fears.\r\n\r\nHe felt that he had engaged himself by a rash promise to an action big\r\nwith incalculable consequences. And then he asked himself if the girl\r\nhad understood what he meant. Who could tell? He was assailed by all\r\nsorts of doubts. Raising his head, he perceived something white flitting\r\nbetween the trees. It vanished almost at once; but there could be no\r\nmistake. He was vexed at being detected roaming like this in the middle\r\nof the night. Who could that be? It never occurred to him that perhaps\r\nthe girl, too, would not be able to sleep. He advanced prudently. Then\r\nhe saw the white, phantom-like apparition again; and the next moment\r\nall his doubts as to the state of her mind were laid at rest, because he\r\nfelt her clinging to him after the manner of supplicants all the world\r\nover. Her whispers were so incoherent that he could not understand\r\nanything; but this did not prevent him from being profoundly moved. He\r\nhad no illusions about her; but his sceptical mind was dominated by the\r\nfulness of his heart.\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself, calm yourself," he murmured in her ear, returning her\r\nclasp at first mechanically, and afterwards with a growing appreciation\r\nof her distressed humanity. The heaving of her breast and the trembling\r\nof all her limbs, in the closeness of his embrace, seemed to enter his\r\nbody, to infect his very heart. While she was growing quieter in his\r\narms, he was becoming more agitated, as if there were only a fixed\r\nquantity of violent emotion on this earth. The very night seemed\r\nmore dumb, more still, and the immobility of the vague, black shapes,\r\nsurrounding him more perfect.\r\n\r\n"It will be all right," he tried to reassure her, with a tone of\r\nconviction, speaking into her ear, and of necessity clasping her more\r\nclosely than before.\r\n\r\nEither the words or the action had a very good effect. He heard a light\r\nsigh of relief. She spoke with a calmed ardour.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I knew it would be all right from the first time you spoke to me!\r\nYes, indeed, I knew directly you came up to me that evening. I knew it\r\nwould be all right, if you only cared to make it so; but of course I\r\ncould not tell if you meant it. \'Command me,\' you said. Funny thing for\r\na man like you to say. Did you really mean it? You weren\'t making fun of\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nHe protested that he had been a serious person all his life.\r\n\r\n"I believe you," she said ardently. He was touched by this declaration.\r\n"It\'s the way you have of speaking as if you were amused with people,"\r\nshe went on. "But I wasn\'t deceived. I could see you were angry with\r\nthat beast of a woman. And you are clever. You spotted something at\r\nonce. You saw it in my face, eh? It isn\'t a bad face--say? You\'ll never\r\nbe sorry. Listen--I\'m not twenty yet. It\'s the truth, and I can\'t be so\r\nbad looking, or else--I will tell you straight that I have been worried\r\nand pestered by fellows like this before. I don\'t know what comes to\r\nthem--"\r\n\r\nShe was speaking hurriedly. She choked, and then exclaimed, with an\r\naccent of despair:\r\n\r\n"What is it? What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nHeyst had removed his arms from her suddenly, and had recoiled a little.\r\n"Is it my fault? I didn\'t even look at them, I tell you straight. Never!\r\nHave I looked at you? Tell me. It was you that began it."\r\n\r\nIn truth, Heyst had shrunk from the idea of competition with fellows\r\nunknown, with Schomberg the hotel-keeper. The vaporous white figure\r\nbefore him swayed pitifully in the darkness. He felt ashamed of his\r\nfastidiousness.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid we have been detected," he murmured. "I think I saw\r\nsomebody on the path between the house and the bushes behind you."\r\n\r\nHe had seen no one. It was a compassionate lie, if there ever was one.\r\nHis compassion was as genuine as his shrinking had been, and in his\r\njudgement more honourable.\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t turn her head. She was obviously relieved.\r\n\r\n"Would it be that brute?" she breathed out, meaning Schomberg, of\r\ncourse. "He\'s getting too forward with me now. What can you expect? Only\r\nthis evening, after supper, he--but I slipped away. You don\'t mind him,\r\ndo you? Why, I could face him myself now that I know you care for me.\r\nA girl can always put up a fight. You believe me? Only it isn\'t easy to\r\nstand up for yourself when you feel there\'s nothing and nobody at your\r\nback. There\'s nothing so lonely in the world as a girl who has got to\r\nlook after herself. When I left poor dad in that home--it was in the\r\ncountry, near a village--I came out of the gates with seven shillings\r\nand threepence in my old purse, and my railway ticket. I tramped a mile,\r\nand got into a train--"\r\n\r\nShe broke off, and was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you throw me over now," she went on. "If you did, what should\r\nI do? I should have to live, to be sure, because I\'d be afraid to kill\r\nmyself, but you would have done a thousand times worse than killing a\r\nbody. You told me you had been always alone, you had never had a dog\r\neven. Well, then, I won\'t be in anybody\'s way if I live with you--not\r\neven a dog\'s. And what else did you mean when you came up and looked at\r\nme so close?"\r\n\r\n"Close? Did I?" he murmured unstirring before her in the profound\r\ndarkness. "So close as that?"\r\n\r\nShe had an outbreak of anger and despair in subdued tones.\r\n\r\n"Have you forgotten, then? What did you expect to find? I know what sort\r\nof girl I am; but all the same I am not the sort that men turn their\r\nbacks on--and you ought to know it, unless you aren\'t made like the\r\nothers. Oh, forgive me! You aren\'t like the others; you are like no one\r\nin the world I ever spoke to. Don\'t you care for me? Don\'t you see--?"\r\n\r\nWhat he saw was that, white and spectral, she was putting out her arms\r\nto him out of the black shadows like an appealing ghost. He took her\r\nhands, and was affected, almost surprised, to find them so warm, so\r\nreal, so firm, so living in his grasp. He drew her to him, and she\r\ndropped her head on his shoulder with a deep-sigh.\r\n\r\n"I am dead tired," she whispered plaintively.\r\n\r\nHe put his arms around her, and only by the convulsive movements of her\r\nbody became aware that she was sobbing without a sound. Sustaining her,\r\nhe lost himself in the profound silence of the night. After a while she\r\nbecame still, and cried quietly. Then, suddenly, as if waking up, she\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t seen any more of that somebody you thought was spying\r\nabout?"\r\n\r\nHe started at her quick, sharp whisper, and answered that very likely he\r\nhad been mistaken.\r\n\r\n"If it was anybody at all," she reflected aloud, "it wouldn\'t have been\r\nanyone but that hotel woman--the landlord\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Schomberg," Heyst said, surprised.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Another one that can\'t sleep o\' nights. Why? Don\'t you see why?\r\nBecause, of course, she sees what\'s going on. That beast doesn\'t even\r\ntry to keep it from her. If she had only the least bit of spirit! She\r\nknows how I feel, too, only she\'s too frightened even to look him in the\r\nface, let alone open her mouth. He would tell her to go hang herself."\r\n\r\nFor some time Heyst said nothing. A public, active contest with the\r\nhotel-keeper was not to be thought of. The idea was horrible. Whispering\r\ngently to the girl, he tried to explain to her that as things stood, an\r\nopen withdrawal from the company would be probably opposed. She listened\r\nto his explanation anxiously, from time to time pressing the hand she\r\nhad sought and got hold of in the dark.\r\n\r\n"As I told you, I am not rich enough to buy you out so I shall steal you\r\nas soon as I can arrange some means of getting away from here. Meantime\r\nit would be fatal to be seen together at night. We mustn\'t give\r\nourselves away. We had better part at once. I think I was mistaken just\r\nnow; but if, as you say, that poor Mrs. Schomberg can\'t sleep of nights,\r\nwe must be more careful. She would tell the fellow."\r\n\r\nThe girl had disengaged herself from his loose hold while he talked, and\r\nnow stood free of him, but still clasping his hand firmly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," she said with perfect assurance. "I tell you she daren\'t open\r\nher mouth to him. And she isn\'t as silly as she looks. She wouldn\'t give\r\nus away. She knows a trick worth two of that. She\'ll help--that\'s what\r\nshe\'ll do, if she dares do anything at all."\r\n\r\n"You seem to have a very clear view of the situation," said Heyst, and\r\nreceived a warm, lingering kiss for this commendation.\r\n\r\nHe discovered that to part from her was not such an easy matter as he\r\nhad supposed it would be.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," he said before they separated, "I don\'t even know your\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you? They call me Alma. I don\'t know why. Silly name! Magdalen\r\ntoo. It doesn\'t matter; you can call me by whatever name you choose.\r\nYes, you give me a name. Think of one you would like the sound\r\nof--something quite new. How I should like to forget everything that has\r\ngone before, as one forgets a dream that\'s done with, fright and all! I\r\nwould try."\r\n\r\n"Would you really?" he asked in a murmur. "But that\'s not forbidden. I\r\nunderstand that women easily forget whatever in their past diminishes\r\nthem in their eyes."\r\n\r\n"It\'s your eyes that I was thinking of, for I\'m sure I\'ve never wished\r\nto forget anything till you came up to me that night and looked me\r\nthrough and through. I know I\'m not much account; but I know how to\r\nstand by a man. I stood by father ever since I could understand. He\r\nwasn\'t a bad chap. Now that I can\'t be of any use to him, I would just\r\nas soon forget all that and make a fresh start. But these aren\'t things\r\nthat I could talk to you about. What could I ever talk to you about?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let it trouble you," Heyst said. "Your voice is enough. I am in\r\nlove with it, whatever it says."\r\n\r\nShe remained silent for a while, as if rendered breathless by this quiet\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I wanted to ask you--"\r\n\r\nHe remembered that she probably did not know his name, and expected the\r\nquestion to be put to him now; but after a moment of hesitation she went\r\non:\r\n\r\n"Why was it that you told me to smile this evening in the concert-room\r\nthere--you remember?"\r\n\r\n"I thought we were being observed. A smile is the best of masks.\r\nSchomberg was at a table next but one to us, drinking with some Dutch\r\nclerks from the town. No doubt he was watching us--watching you, at\r\nleast. That\'s why I asked you to smile."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s why. It never came into my head!"\r\n\r\n"And you did it very well, too--very readily, as if you had understood\r\nmy intention."\r\n\r\n"Readily!" she repeated. "Oh, I was ready enough to smile then. That\'s\r\nthe truth. It was the first time for years I may say that I felt\r\ndisposed to smile. I\'ve not had many chances to smile in my life, I can\r\ntell you; especially of late."\r\n\r\n"But you do it most charmingly--in a perfectly fascinating way."\r\n\r\nHe paused. She stood still, waiting for more with the stillness of\r\nextreme delight, wishing to prolong the sensation.\r\n\r\n"It astonished me," he added. "It went as straight to my heart as though\r\nyou had smiled for the purpose of dazzling me. I felt as if I had never\r\nseen a smile before in my life. I thought of it after I left you. It\r\nmade me restless."\r\n\r\n"It did all that?" came her voice, unsteady, gentle, and incredulous.\r\n\r\n"If you had not smiled as you did, perhaps I should not have come out\r\nhere tonight," he said, with his playful earnestness of tone. "It was\r\nyour triumph."\r\n\r\nHe felt her lips touch his lightly, and the next moment she was gone.\r\nHer white dress gleamed in the distance, and then the opaque darkness of\r\nthe house seemed to swallow it. Heyst waited a little before he went the\r\nsame way, round the corner, up the steps of the veranda, and into his\r\nroom, where he lay down at last--not to sleep, but to go over in his\r\nmind all that had been said at their meeting.\r\n\r\n"It\'s exactly true about that smile," he thought. There he had spoken\r\nthe truth to her; and about her voice, too. For the rest--what must be\r\nmust be.\r\n\r\nA great wave of heat passed over him. He turned on his back, flung his\r\narms crosswise on the broad, hard bed, and lay still, open-eyed under\r\nthe mosquito net, till daylight entered his room, brightened swiftly,\r\nand turned to unfailing sunlight. He got up then, went to a small\r\nlooking-glass hanging on the wall, and stared at himself steadily. It\r\nwas not a new-born vanity which induced this long survey. He felt\r\nso strange that he could not resist the suspicion of his personal\r\nappearance having changed during the night. What he saw in the glass,\r\nhowever, was the man he knew before. It was almost a disappointment--a\r\nbelittling of his recent experience. And then he smiled at his\r\nnaiveness; for, being over five and thirty years of age, he ought to\r\nhave known that in most cases the body is the unalterable mask of the\r\nsoul, which even death itself changes but little, till it is put out of\r\nsight where no changes matter any more, either to our friends or to our\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nHeyst was not conscious of either friends or of enemies. It was the very\r\nessence of his life to be a solitary achievement, accomplished not by\r\nhermit-like withdrawal with its silence and immobility, but by a system\r\nof restless wandering, by the detachment of an impermanent dweller\r\namongst changing scenes. In this scheme he had perceived the means of\r\npassing through life without suffering and almost without a single care\r\nin the world--invulnerable because elusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years Heyst had wandered, invariably courteous and\r\nunapproachable, and in return was generally considered a "queer chap."\r\nHe had started off on these travels of his after the death of his\r\nfather, an expatriated Swede who died in London, dissatisfied with his\r\ncountry and angry with all the world, which had instinctively rejected\r\nhis wisdom.\r\n\r\nThinker, stylist, and man of the world in his time, the elder Heyst\r\nhad begun by coveting all the joys, those of the great and those of the\r\nhumble, those of the fools and those of the sages. For more than sixty\r\nyears he had dragged on this painful earth of ours the most weary, the\r\nmost uneasy soul that civilization had ever fashioned to its ends of\r\ndisillusion and regret. One could not refuse him a measure of greatness,\r\nfor he was unhappy in a way unknown to mediocre souls. His mother Heyst\r\nhad never known, but he kept his father\'s pale, distinguished face\r\nin affectionate memory. He remembered him mainly in an ample blue\r\ndressing-gown in a large house of a quiet London suburb. For three\r\nyears, after leaving school at the age of eighteen, he had lived with\r\nthe elder Heyst, who was then writing his last book. In this work, at\r\nthe end of his life, he claimed for mankind that right to absolute moral\r\nand intellectual liberty of which he no longer believed them worthy.\r\n\r\nThree years of such companionship at that plastic and impressionable age\r\nwere bound to leave in the boy a profound mistrust of life. The young\r\nman learned to reflect, which is a destructive process, a reckoning\r\nof the cost. It is not the clear-sighted who lead the world. Great\r\nachievements are accomplished in a blessed, warm mental fog, which the\r\npitiless cold blasts of the father\'s analysis had blown away from the\r\nson.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll drift," Heyst had said to himself deliberately.\r\n\r\nHe did not mean intellectually or sentimentally or morally. He meant\r\nto drift altogether and literally, body and soul, like a detached leaf\r\ndrifting in the wind-currents under the immovable trees of a forest\r\nglade; to drift without ever catching on to anything.\r\n\r\n"This shall be my defence against life," he had said to himself with a\r\nsort of inward consciousness that for the son of his father there was no\r\nother worthy alternative.\r\n\r\nHe became a waif and stray, austerely, from conviction, as others\r\ndo through drink, from vice, from some weakness of character--with\r\ndeliberation, as others do in despair. This, stripped of its facts, had\r\nbeen Heyst\'s life up to that disturbing night. Next day, when he saw the\r\ngirl called Alma, she managed to give him a glance of frank tenderness,\r\nquick as lightning and leaving a profound impression, a secret touch on\r\nthe heart. It was in the grounds of the hotel, about tiffin time, while\r\nthe Ladies of the orchestra were strolling back to their pavilion after\r\nrehearsal, or practice, or whatever they called their morning musical\r\nexercises in the hall. Heyst, returning from the town, where he had\r\ndiscovered that there would be difficulties in the way of getting away\r\nat once, was crossing the compound, disappointed and worried. He had\r\nwalked almost unwittingly into the straggling group of Zangiacomo\'s\r\nperformers. It was a shock to him, on coming out of his brown study, to\r\nfind the girl so near to him, as if one waking suddenly should see the\r\nfigure of his dream turned into flesh and blood. She did not raise her\r\nshapely head, but her glance was no dream thing. It was real, the most\r\nreal impression of his detached existence--so far.\r\n\r\nHeyst had not acknowledged it in any way, though it seemed to him\r\nimpossible that its effect on him should not be visible to anyone who\r\nhappened to be looking on. And there were several men on the\r\nveranda, steady customers of Schomberg\'s table d\'hote, gazing in his\r\ndirection--at the ladies of the orchestra, in fact. Heyst\'s dread arose,\r\nnot out of shame or timidity, but from his fastidiousness. On getting\r\namongst them, however, he noticed no signs of interest or astonishment\r\nin their faces, any more than if they had been blind men. Even Schomberg\r\nhimself, who had to make way for him at the top of the stairs, was\r\ncompletely unperturbed, and continued the conversation he was carrying\r\non with a client.\r\n\r\nSchomberg, indeed, had observed "that Swede" talking with the girl in\r\nthe intervals. A crony of his had nudged him; and he had thought that it\r\nwas so much the better; the silly fellow would keep everybody else off.\r\nHe was rather pleased than otherwise and watched them out of the corner\r\nof his eye with a malicious enjoyment of the situation--a sort of\r\nSatanic glee. For he had little doubt of his personal fascination, and\r\nstill less of his power to get hold of the girl, who seemed too ignorant\r\nto know how to help herself, and who was worse than friendless, since\r\nshe had for some reason incurred the animosity of Mrs. Zangiacomo, a\r\nwoman with no conscience. The aversion she showed him as far as she\r\ndared (for it is not always safe for the helpless to display the\r\ndelicacy of their sentiments), Schomberg pardoned on the score of\r\nfeminine conventional silliness. He had told Alma, as an argument, that\r\nshe was a clever enough girl to see that she could do no better than to\r\nput her trust in a man of substance, in the prime of life, who knew\r\nhis way about. But for the excited trembling of his voice, and the\r\nextraordinary way in which his eyes seemed to be starting out of his\r\ncrimson, hirsute countenance, such speeches had every character of calm,\r\nunselfish advice--which, after the manner of lovers, passed easily into\r\nsanguine plans for the future.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll soon get rid of the old woman," he whispered to her hurriedly,\r\nwith panting ferocity. "Hang her! I\'ve never cared for her. The climate\r\ndon\'t suit her; I shall tell her to go to her people in Europe. She will\r\nhave to go, too! I will see to it. Eins, zwei, march! And then we shall\r\nsell this hotel and start another somewhere else."\r\n\r\nHe assured her that he didn\'t care what he did for her sake; and it\r\nwas true. Forty-five is the age of recklessness for many men, as if in\r\ndefiance of the decay and death waiting with open arms in the sinister\r\nvalley at the bottom of the inevitable hill. Her shrinking form, her\r\ndowncast eyes, when she had to listen to him, cornered at the end of an\r\nempty corridor, he regarded as signs of submission to the overpowering\r\nforce of his will, the recognition of his personal fascinations. For\r\nevery age is fed on illusions, lest men should renounce life early and\r\nthe human race come to an end.\r\n\r\nIt\'s easy to imagine Schomberg\'s humiliation, his shocked fury, when\r\nhe discovered that the girl who had for weeks resisted his attacks, his\r\nprayers, and his fiercest protestations, had been snatched from under\r\nhis nose by "that Swede," apparently without any trouble worth speaking\r\nof. He refused to believe the fact. He would have it, at first, that\r\nthe Zangiacomos, for some unfathomable reason, had played him a scurvy\r\ntrick, but when no further doubt was possible, he changed his view of\r\nHeyst. The despised Swede became for Schomberg the deepest, the most\r\ndangerous, the most hateful of scoundrels. He could not believe that the\r\ncreature he had coveted with so much force and with so little effect,\r\nwas in reality tender, docile to her impulse, and had almost offered\r\nherself to Heyst without a sense of guilt, in a desire of safety, and\r\nfrom a profound need of placing her trust where her woman\'s instinct\r\nguided her ignorance. Nothing would serve Schomberg but that she must\r\nhave been circumvented by some occult exercise of force or craft, by the\r\nlaying of some subtle trap. His wounded vanity wondered ceaselessly at\r\nthe means "that Swede" had employed to seduce her away from a man\r\nlike him--Schomberg--as though those means were bound to have been\r\nextraordinary, unheard of, inconceivable. He slapped his forehead openly\r\nbefore his customers; he would sit brooding in silence or else would\r\nburst out unexpectedly declaiming against Heyst without measure,\r\ndiscretion, or prudence, with swollen features and an affectation of\r\noutraged virtue which could not have deceived the most childlike of\r\nmoralists for a moment--and greatly amused his audience.\r\n\r\nIt became a recognized entertainment to go and hear his abuse of Heyst,\r\nwhile sipping iced drinks on the veranda of the hotel. It was, in a\r\nmanner, a more successful draw than the Zangiacomo concerts had ever\r\nbeen--intervals and all. There was never any difficulty in starting the\r\nperformer off. Anybody could do it, by almost any distant allusion.\r\nAs likely as not he would start his endless denunciations in the very\r\nbilliard-room where Mrs. Schomberg sat enthroned as usual, swallowing\r\nher sobs, concealing her tortures of abject humiliation and terror under\r\nher stupid, set, everlasting grin, which, having been provided for her\r\nby nature, was an excellent mask, in as much as nothing--not even death\r\nitself, perhaps--could tear it away.\r\n\r\nBut nothing lasts in this world, at least without changing its\r\nphysiognomy. So, after a few weeks, Schomberg regained his outward calm,\r\nas if his indignation had dried up within him. And it was time. He was\r\nbecoming a bore with his inability to talk of anything else but Heyst\'s\r\nunfitness to be at large, Heyst\'s wickedness, his wiles, his astuteness,\r\nand his criminality. Schomberg no longer pretended to despise him. He\r\ncould not have done it. After what had happened he could not pretend,\r\neven to himself. But his bottled-up indignation was fermenting\r\nvenomously. At the time of his immoderate loquacity one of his\r\ncustomers, an elderly man, had remarked one evening:\r\n\r\n"If that ass keeps on like this, he will end by going crazy."\r\n\r\nAnd this belief was less than half wrong. Schomberg had Heyst on the\r\nbrain. Even the unsatisfactory state of his affairs, which had\r\nnever been so unpromising since he came out East directly after the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, he referred to some subtly noxious influence of\r\nHeyst. It seemed to him that he could never be himself again till he had\r\ngot even with that artful Swede. He was ready to swear that Heyst had\r\nruined his life. The girl so unfairly, craftily, basely decoyed away\r\nwould have inspired him to success in a new start. Obviously Mrs.\r\nSchomberg, whom he terrified by savagely silent moods combined with\r\nunderhand, poisoned glances, could give him no inspiration. He had grown\r\ngenerally neglectful, but with a partiality for reckless expedients, as\r\nif he did not care when and how his career as a hotel-keeper was to be\r\nbrought to an end. This demoralized state accounted for what Davidson\r\nhad observed on his last visit to the Schomberg establishment, some two\r\nmonths after Heyst\'s secret departure with the girl to the solitude of\r\nSamburan.\r\n\r\nThe Schomberg of a few years ago--the Schomberg of the Bangkok days,\r\nfor instance, when he started the first of his famed table d\'hote\r\ndinners--would never have risked anything of the sort. His genius ran to\r\ncatering, "white man for white men" and to the inventing, elaborating,\r\nand retailing of scandalous gossip with asinine unction and impudent\r\ndelight. But now his mind was perverted by the pangs of wounded vanity\r\nand of thwarted passion. In this state of moral weakness Schomberg\r\nallowed himself to be corrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nThe business was done by a guest who arrived one fine morning by\r\nmail-boat--immediately from Celebes, having boarded her in Macassar,\r\nbut generally, Schomberg understood, from up China Sea way; a wanderer\r\nclearly, even as Heyst was, but not alone and of quite another kind.\r\n\r\nSchomberg, looking up from the stern-sheets of his steam-launch, which\r\nhe used for boarding passenger ships on arrival, discovered a dark\r\nsunken stare plunging down on him over the rail of the first-class part\r\nof the deck. He was no great judge of physiognomy. Human beings, for\r\nhim, were either the objects of scandalous gossip or else recipients of\r\nnarrow strips of paper, with proper bill-heads stating the name of his\r\nhotel--"W. Schomberg, proprietor, accounts settled weekly."\r\n\r\nSo in the clean-shaven, extremely thin face hanging over the mail-boat\'s\r\nrail Schomberg saw only the face of a possible "account." The\r\nsteam-launches of other hotels were also alongside, but he obtained the\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n"You are Mr. Schomberg, aren\'t you?" the face asked quite unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n"I am at your service," he answered from below; for business is\r\nbusiness, and its forms and formulas must be observed, even if one\'s\r\nmanly bosom is tortured by that dull rage which succeeds the fury of\r\nbaffled passion, like the glow of embers after a fierce blaze.\r\n\r\nPresently the possessor of the handsome but emaciated face was seated\r\nbeside Schomberg in the stern-sheets of the launch. His body was long\r\nand loose-jointed, his slender fingers, intertwined, clasped the leg\r\nresting on the knee, as he lolled back in a careless yet tense attitude.\r\nOn the other side of Schomberg sat another passenger, who was introduced\r\nby the clean-shaven man as--\r\n\r\n"My secretary. He must have the room next to mine."\r\n\r\n"We can manage that easily for you."\r\n\r\nSchomberg steered with dignity, staring straight ahead, but very much\r\ninterested by these two promising "accounts." Their belongings, a couple\r\nof large leather trunks browned by age and a few smaller packages,\r\nwere piled up in the bows. A third individual--a nondescript, hairy\r\ncreature--had modestly made his way forward and had perched himself on\r\nthe luggage. The lower part of his physiognomy was over-developed;\r\nhis narrow and low forehead, unintelligently furrowed by horizontal\r\nwrinkles, surmounted wildly hirsute cheeks and a flat nose with wide,\r\nbaboon-like nostrils. There was something equivocal in the appearance of\r\nhis shaggy, hair-smothered humanity. He, too, seemed to be a follower of\r\nthe clean-shaven man, and apparently had travelled on deck with native\r\npassengers, sleeping under the awnings. His broad, squat frame denoted\r\ngreat strength. Grasping the gunwales of the launch, he displayed a\r\npair of remarkably long arms, terminating in thick, brown hairy paws of\r\nsimian aspect.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do with the fellow of mine?" the chief of the party asked\r\nSchomberg. "There must be a boarding-house somewhere near the port--some\r\ngrog-shop where they could let him have a mat to sleep on?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg said there was a place kept by a Portuguese half-caste.\r\n\r\n"A servant of yours?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, he hangs on to me. He is an alligator-hunter. I picked him up in\r\nColombia, you know. Ever been in Colombia?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Schomberg, very much surprised. "An alligator-hunter? Funny\r\ntrade! Are you coming from Colombia, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I have been coming for a long time. I come from a good many\r\nplaces. I am travelling west, you see."\r\n\r\n"For sport, perhaps?" suggested Schomberg.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Sort of sport. What do you say to chasing the sun?"\r\n\r\n"I see--a gentleman at large," said Schomberg, watching a sailing canoe\r\nabout to cross his bow, and ready to clear it by a touch of the helm.\r\n\r\nThe other passenger made himself heard suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Hang these native craft! They always get in the way."\r\n\r\nHe was a muscular, short man with eyes that gleamed and blinked, a harsh\r\nvoice, and a round, toneless, pock-marked face ornamented by a thin,\r\ndishevelled moustache, sticking out quaintly under the tip of a rigid\r\nnose. Schomberg made the reflection that there was nothing secretarial\r\nabout him. Both he and his long, lank principal wore the usual white\r\nsuit of the tropics, cork helmets, pipe-clayed white shoes--all correct.\r\nThe hairy nondescript creature perched on their luggage in the bow had a\r\ncheck shirt and blue dungaree trousers. He gazed in their direction from\r\nforward in an expectant, trained-animal manner.\r\n\r\n"You spoke to me first," said Schomberg in his manly tones. "You were\r\nacquainted with my name. Where did you hear of me, gentlemen, may I\r\nask?"\r\n\r\n"In Manila," answered the gentleman at large, readily. "From a man with\r\nwhom I had a game of cards one evening in the Hotel Castille."\r\n\r\n"What man? I\'ve no friends in Manila that I know of," wondered Schomberg\r\nwith a severe frown.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you his name. I\'ve clean forgotten it; but don\'t you\r\nworry. He was anything but a friend of yours. He called you all the\r\nnames he could think of. He said you set a lot of scandal going about\r\nhim once, somewhere--in Bangkok, I think. Yes, that\'s it. You were\r\nrunning a table d\'hote in Bangkok at one time, weren\'t you?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg, astounded by the turn of the information, could only throw\r\nout his chest more and exaggerate his austere Lieutenant-of-the-Reserve\r\nmanner. A table d\'hote? Yes, certainly. He always--for the sake of white\r\nmen. And here in this place, too? Yes, in this place, too.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right, then." The stranger turned his black, cavernous,\r\nmesmerizing glance away from the bearded Schomberg, who sat gripping\r\nthe brass tiller in a sweating palm. "Many people in the evening at your\r\nplace?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg had recovered somewhat.\r\n\r\n"Twenty covers or so, take one day with another," he answered feelingly,\r\nas befitted a subject on which he was sensitive. "Ought to be more,\r\nif only people would see that it\'s for their own good. Precious little\r\nprofit I get out of it. You are partial to tables d\'hote, gentlemen?"\r\n\r\nThe new guest made answer that he liked a hotel where one could find\r\nsome local people in the evening. It was infernally dull otherwise. The\r\nsecretary, in sign of approval, emitted a grunt of astonishing ferocity,\r\nas if proposing to himself to eat the local people. All this sounded\r\nlike a longish stay, thought Schomberg, satisfied under his grave air;\r\ntill, remembering the girl snatched away from him by the last guest who\r\nhad made a prolonged stay in his hotel, he ground his teeth so audibly\r\nthat the other two looked at him in wonder. The momentary convulsion\r\nof his florid physiognomy seemed to strike them dumb. They exchanged a\r\nquick glance. Presently the clean-shaven man fired out another question\r\nin his curt, unceremonious manner:\r\n\r\n"You have no women in your hotel, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Women!" Schomberg exclaimed indignantly, but also as if a little\r\nfrightened. "What on earth do you mean by women? What women? There\'s\r\nMrs. Schomberg, of course," he added, suddenly appeased, with lofty\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n"If she knows how to keep her place, then it will do. I can\'t stand\r\nwomen near me. They give me the horrors," declared the other. "They are\r\na perfect curse!"\r\n\r\nDuring this outburst the secretary wore a savage grin. The chief guest\r\nclosed his sunken eyes, as if exhausted, and leaned the back of his head\r\nagainst the stanchion of the awning. In this pose, his long, feminine\r\neyelashes were very noticeable, and his regular features, sharp line of\r\nthe jaw, and well-cut chin were brought into prominence, giving him a\r\nused-up, weary, depraved distinction. He did not open his eyes till\r\nthe steam-launch touched the quay. Then he and the other man got ashore\r\nquickly, entered a carriage, and drove away to the hotel, leaving\r\nSchomberg to look after their luggage and take care of their strange\r\ncompanion. The latter, looking more like a performing bear abandoned by\r\nhis show men than a human being, followed all Schomberg\'s movements step\r\nby step, close behind his back, muttering to himself in a language\r\nthat sounded like some sort of uncouth Spanish. The hotel-keeper felt\r\nuncomfortable till at last he got rid of him at an obscure den where\r\na very clean, portly Portuguese half-caste, standing serenely in the\r\ndoorway, seemed to understand exactly how to deal with clients of every\r\nkind. He took from the creature the strapped bundle it had been hugging\r\nclosely through all its peregrinations in that strange town, and cut\r\nshort Schomberg\'s attempts at explanation by a most confident--\r\n\r\n"I comprehend very well, sir."\r\n\r\n"It\'s more than I do," thought Schomberg, going away thankful at being\r\nrelieved of the alligator-hunter\'s company. He wondered what these\r\nfellows were, without being able to form a guess of sufficient\r\nprobability. Their names he learned that very day by direct inquiry "to\r\nenter in my books," he explained in his formal military manner, chest\r\nthrown out, beard very much in evidence.\r\n\r\nThe shaven man, sprawling in a long chair, with his air of withered\r\nyouth, raised his eyes languidly.\r\n\r\n"My name? Oh, plain Mr. Jones--put that down--a gentleman at large. And\r\nthis is Ricardo." The pock-marked man, lying prostrate in another long\r\nchair, made a grimace, as if something had tickled the end of his nose,\r\nbut did not come out of his supineness. "Martin Ricardo, secretary. You\r\ndon\'t want any more of our history, do you? Eh, what? Occupation? Put\r\ndown, well--tourists. We\'ve been called harder names before now; it\r\nwon\'t hurt our feelings. And that fellow of mine--where did you tuck him\r\naway? Oh, he will be all right. When he wants anything he\'ll take it.\r\nHe\'s Peter. Citizen of Colombia. Peter, Pedro--I don\'t know that he ever\r\nhad any other name. Pedro, alligator hunter. Oh, yes--I\'ll pay his board\r\nwith the half-caste. Can\'t help myself. He\'s so confoundedly devoted to\r\nme that if I were to give him the sack he would fly at my throat. Shall\r\nI tell you how I killed his brother in the wilds of Colombia? Well,\r\nperhaps some other time--it\'s a rather long story. What I shall always\r\nregret is that I didn\'t kill him, too. I could have done it without any\r\nextra trouble then; now it\'s too late. Great nuisance; but he\'s useful\r\nsometimes. I hope you are not going to put all this in your book?"\r\n\r\nThe offhand, hard manner and the contemptuous tone of "plain Mr. Jones"\r\ndisconcerted Schomberg utterly. He had never been spoken to like this\r\nin his life. He shook his head in silence and withdrew, not exactly\r\nscared--though he was in reality of a timid disposition under his manly\r\nexterior--but distinctly mystified and impressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, after putting his cash-box away in the safe which\r\nfilled with its iron bulk a corner of their room, Schomberg turned\r\ntowards his wife, but without looking at her exactly, and said:\r\n\r\n"I must get rid of these two. It won\'t do!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Schomberg had entertained that very opinion from the first; but she\r\nhad been broken years ago into keeping her opinions to herself. Sitting\r\nin her night attire in the light of a single candle, she was careful not\r\nto make a sound, knowing from experience that her very assent would be\r\nresented. With her eyes she followed the figure of Schomberg, clad in\r\nhis sleeping suit, and moving restlessly about the room.\r\n\r\nHe never glanced her way, for the reason that Mrs. Schomberg, in\r\nher night attire, looked the most unattractive object in\r\nexistence--miserable, insignificant, faded, crushed, old. And the\r\ncontrast with the feminine form he had ever in his mind\'s eye made his\r\nwife\'s appearance painful to his aesthetic sense.\r\n\r\nSchomberg walked about swearing and fuming for the purpose of screwing\r\nhis courage up to the sticking point.\r\n\r\n"Hang me if I ought not to go now, at once, this minute, into his\r\nbedroom, and tell him to be off--him and that secretary of his--early in\r\nthe morning. I don\'t mind a round game of cards, but to make a decoy of\r\nmy table d\'hote--my blood boils! He came here because some lying rascal\r\nin Manila told him I kept a table d\'hote."\r\n\r\nHe said these things, not for Mrs. Schomberg\'s information, but simply\r\nthinking aloud, and trying to work his fury up to a point where it would\r\ngive him courage enough to face "plain Mr. Jones."\r\n\r\n"Impudent overbearing, swindling sharper," he went on. "I have a good\r\nmind to--"\r\n\r\nHe was beside himself in his lurid, heavy, Teutonic manner, so unlike\r\nthe picturesque, lively rage of the Latin races; and though his eyes\r\nstrayed about irresolutely, yet his swollen, angry features awakened in\r\nthe miserable woman over whom he had been tyrannizing for years a fear\r\nfor his precious carcass, since the poor creature had nothing else but\r\nthat to hold on to in the world. She knew him well; but she did not know\r\nhim altogether. The last thing a woman will consent to discover in a man\r\nwhom she loves, or on whom she simply depends, is want of courage. And,\r\ntimid in her corner, she ventured to say pressingly:\r\n\r\n"Be careful, Wilhelm! Remember the knives and revolvers in their\r\ntrunks."\r\n\r\nIn guise of thanks for that anxious reminder, he swore horribly in\r\nthe direction of her shrinking person. In her scanty nightdress, and\r\nbarefooted, she recalled a mediaeval penitent being reproved for her\r\nsins in blasphemous terms. Those lethal weapons were always present to\r\nSchomberg\'s mind. Personally, he had never seen them. His part, ten\r\ndays after his guests\' arrival, had been to lounge in manly, careless\r\nattitudes on the veranda--keeping watch--while Mrs. Schomberg, provided\r\nwith a bunch of assorted keys, her discoloured teeth chattering and her\r\nglobular eyes absolutely idiotic with fright, was "going through" the\r\nluggage of these strange clients. Her terrible Wilhelm had insisted on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be on the look-out, I tell you," he said. "I shall give you a\r\nwhistle when I see them coming back. You couldn\'t whistle. And if he\r\nwere to catch you at it, and chuck you out by the scruff of the neck, it\r\nwouldn\'t hurt you much; but he won\'t touch a woman. Not he! He has told\r\nme so. Affected beast. I must find out something about their little\r\ngame, and so there\'s an end of it. Go in! Go now! Quick march!"\r\n\r\nIt had been an awful job; but she did go in, because she was much more\r\nafraid of Schomberg than of any possible consequences of the act. Her\r\ngreatest concern was lest no key of the bunch he had provided her with\r\nshould fit the locks. It would have been such a disappointment for\r\nWilhelm. However, the trunks, she found, had been left open; but her\r\ninvestigation did not last long. She was frightened of firearms, and\r\ngenerally of all weapons, not from personal cowardice, but as some women\r\nare, almost superstitiously, from an abstract horror of violence and\r\nmurder. She was out again on the veranda long before Wilhelm had any\r\noccasion for a warning whistle. The instinctive, motiveless fear being\r\nthe most difficult to overcome, nothing could induce her to return to\r\nher investigations, neither threatening growls nor ferocious hisses, nor\r\nyet a poke or two in the ribs.\r\n\r\n"Stupid female!" muttered the hotel-keeper, perturbed by the notion\r\nof that armoury in one of his bedrooms. This was from no abstract\r\nsentiment, with him it was constitutional. "Get out of my sight," he\r\nsnarled. "Go and dress yourself for the table d\'hote."\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Schomberg had meditated. What the devil did this mean?\r\nHis thinking processes were sluggish and spasmodic; but suddenly the\r\ntruth came to him.\r\n\r\n"By heavens, they are desperadoes!" he thought.\r\n\r\nJust then he beheld "plain Mr. Jones" and his secretary with the\r\nambiguous name of Ricardo entering the grounds of the hotel. They had\r\nbeen down to the port on some business, and now were returning; Mr.\r\nJones lank, spare, opening his long legs with angular regularity like\r\na pair of compasses, the other stepping out briskly by his side.\r\nConviction entered Schomberg\'s heart. They were two desperadoes--no\r\ndoubt about it. But as the funk which he experienced was merely\r\na general sensation, he managed to put on his most severe\r\nOfficer-of-the-Reserve manner, long before they had closed with him.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, gentlemen."\r\n\r\nBeing answered with derisive civility, he became confirmed in his sudden\r\nconviction of their desperate character. The way Mr. Jones turned his\r\nhollow eyes on one, like an incurious spectre, and the way the other,\r\nwhen addressed, suddenly retracted his lips and exhibited his teeth\r\nwithout looking round--here was evidence enough to settle that point.\r\nDesperadoes! They passed through the billiard-room, inscrutably\r\nmysterious, to the back of the house, to join their violated trunks.\r\n\r\n"Tiffin bell will ring in five minutes, gentlemen." Schomberg called\r\nafter them, exaggerating the deep manliness of his tone.\r\n\r\nHe had managed to upset himself very much. He expected to see them come\r\nback infuriated and begin to bully him with an odious lack of restraint.\r\nDesperadoes! However they didn\'t; they had not noticed anything unusual\r\nabout their trunks and Schomberg recovered his composure and said\r\nto himself that he must get rid of this deadly incubus as soon as\r\npracticable. They couldn\'t possibly want to stay very long; this was not\r\nthe town--the colony--for desperate characters. He shrank from action.\r\nHe dreaded any kind of disturbance--"fracas" he called it--in his hotel.\r\nSuch things were not good for business. Of course, sometimes one had to\r\nhave a "fracas;" but it had been a comparatively trifling task to seize\r\nthe frail Zangiacomo--whose bones were no larger than a chicken\'s--round\r\nthe ribs, lift him up bodily, dash him to the ground, and fall on\r\nhim. It had been easy. The wretched, hook-nosed creature lay without\r\nmovement, buried under its purple beard.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, remembering the occasion of that "fracas," Schomberg groaned\r\nwith the pain as of a hot coal under his breastbone, and gave himself up\r\nto desolation. Ah, if he only had that girl with him he would have been\r\nmasterful and resolute and fearless--fight twenty desperadoes--care\r\nfor nobody on earth! Whereas the possession of Mrs. Schomberg was no\r\nincitement to a display of manly virtues. Instead of caring for no one,\r\nhe felt that he cared for nothing. Life was a hollow sham; he wasn\'t\r\ngoing to risk a shot through his lungs or his liver in order to preserve\r\nits integrity. It had no savour--damn it!\r\n\r\nIn his state of moral decomposition, Schomberg, master as he was of the\r\nart of hotel-keeping, and careful of giving no occasion for criticism\r\nto the powers regulating that branch of human activity, let things take\r\ntheir course; though he saw very well where that course was tending.\r\nIt began first with a game or two after dinner--for the drinks,\r\napparently--with some lingering customer, at one of the little tables\r\nranged against the walls of the billiard-room. Schomberg detected the\r\nmeaning of it at once. "That\'s what it was! This was what they were!"\r\nAnd, moving about restlessly (at that time his morose silent period had\r\nset in), he cast sidelong looks at the game; but he said nothing. It was\r\nnot worth while having a row with men who were so overbearing. Even when\r\nmoney appeared in connection with these postprandial games, into which\r\nmore and more people were being drawn, he still refrained from raising\r\nthe question; he was reluctant to draw unduly the attention of "plain\r\nMr. Jones" and of the equivocal Ricardo, to his person. One evening,\r\nhowever, after the public rooms of the hotel had become empty, Schomberg\r\nmade an attempt to grapple with the problem in an indirect way.\r\n\r\nIn a distant corner the tired China boy dozed on his heels, his back\r\nagainst the wall. Mrs. Schomberg had disappeared, as usual, between ten\r\nand eleven. Schomberg walked about slowly in and out of the room and\r\nthe veranda, thoughtful, waiting for his two guests to go to bed. Then\r\nsuddenly he approached them, militarily, his chest thrown out, his voice\r\ncurt and soldierly.\r\n\r\n"Hot night, gentlemen."\r\n\r\nMr Jones, lolling back idly in a chair, looked up. Ricardo, as idle, but\r\nmore upright, made no sign.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you have a drink with me before retiring?" went on Schomberg,\r\nsitting down by the little table.\r\n\r\n"By all means," said Mr. Jones lazily.\r\n\r\nRicardo showed his teeth in a strange, quick grin. Schomberg felt\r\npainfully how difficult it was to get in touch with these men, both\r\nso quiet, so deliberate, so menacingly unceremonious. He ordered the\r\nChinaman to bring in the drinks. His purpose was to discover how long\r\nthese guests intended to stay. Ricardo displayed no conversational vein,\r\nbut Mr. Jones appeared communicative enough. His voice somehow matched\r\nhis sunken eyes. It was hollow without being in the least mournful;\r\nit sounded distant, uninterested, as though he were speaking from the\r\nbottom of a well. Schomberg learned that he would have the privilege of\r\nlodging and boarding these gentlemen for at least a month more. He could\r\nnot conceal his discomfiture at this piece of news.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter? Don\'t you like to have people in your house?" asked\r\nplain Mr. Jones languidly. "I should have thought the owner of a hotel\r\nwould be pleased."\r\n\r\nHe lifted his delicate and beautifully pencilled eyebrows. Schomberg\r\nmuttered something about the locality being dull and uninteresting to\r\ntravellers--nothing going on--too quiet altogether, but he only provoked\r\nthe declaration that quiet had its charm sometimes, and even dullness\r\nwas welcome as a change.\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t had time to be dull for the last three years," added plain\r\nMr. Jones, his eyes fixed darkly on Schomberg whom he further more\r\ninvited to have another drink, this time with him, and not to worry\r\nhimself about things he did not understand; and especially not to be\r\ninhospitable--which in a hotel-keeper is highly unprofessional.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand," grumbled Schomberg. "Oh, yes, I understand\r\nperfectly well. I--"\r\n\r\n"You are frightened," interrupted Mr. Jones. "What is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any scandal in my place. That\'s what\'s the matter."\r\n\r\nSchomberg tried to face the situation bravely, but that steady, black\r\nstare affected him. And when he glanced aside uncomfortably, he met\r\nRicardo\'s grin uncovering a lot of teeth, though the man seemed absorbed\r\nin his thoughts all the time.\r\n\r\n"And, moreover," went on Mr. Jones in that distant tone of his, "you\r\ncan\'t help yourself. Here we are and here we stay. Would you try to\r\nput us out? I dare say you could do it; but you couldn\'t do it without\r\ngetting hurt--very badly hurt. We can promise him that, can\'t we,\r\nMartin?"\r\n\r\nThe secretary retracted his lips and looked up sharply at Schomberg, as\r\nif only too anxious to leap upon him with teeth and claws.\r\n\r\nSchomberg managed to produce a deep laugh.\r\n\r\n"Ha! Ha! Ha!"\r\n\r\nMr Jones closed his eyes wearily, as if the light hurt them, and looked\r\nremarkably like a corpse for a moment. This was bad enough; but when he\r\nopened them again, it was almost a worse trial for Schomberg\'s nerves.\r\nThe spectral intensity of that glance, fixed on the hotel-keeper (and\r\nthis was most frightful) without any definite expression, seemed to\r\ndissolve the last grain of resolution in his character.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think, by any chance, that you have to do with ordinary\r\npeople, do you?" inquired Mr. Jones, in his lifeless manner, which\r\nseemed to imply some sort of menace from beyond the grave.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a gentleman," testified Martin Ricardo with a sudden snap of the\r\nlips, after which his moustaches stirred by themselves in an odd, feline\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wasn\'t thinking of that," said plain Mr. Jones, while Schomberg,\r\ndumb and planted heavily in his chair looked from one to the other,\r\nleaning forward a little. "Of course I am that; but Ricardo attaches\r\ntoo much importance to a social advantage. What I mean, for instance, is\r\nthat he, quiet and inoffensive as you see him sitting here, would think\r\nnothing of setting fire to this house of entertainment of yours. It\r\nwould blaze like a box of matches. Think of that! It wouldn\'t advance\r\nyour affairs much, would it?--whatever happened to us."\r\n\r\n"Come, come gentlemen," remonstrated Schomberg, in a murmur. "This is\r\nvery wild talk!"\r\n\r\n"And you have been used to deal with tame people, haven\'t you? But we\r\naren\'t tame. We once kept a whole angry town at bay for two days, and\r\nthen we got away with our plunder. It was in Venezuela. Ask Martin\r\nhere--he can tell you."\r\n\r\nInstinctively Schomberg looked at Ricardo, who only passed the tip of\r\nhis tongue over his lips with an uncanny sort of gusto, but did not\r\noffer to begin.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps it would be a rather long story," Mr. Jones conceded\r\nafter a short silence.\r\n\r\n"I have no desire to hear it, I am sure," said Schomberg. "This isn\'t\r\nVenezuela. You wouldn\'t get away from here like that. But all this is\r\nsilly talk of the worst sort. Do you mean to say you would make deadly\r\ntrouble for the sake of a few guilders that you and that other"--eyeing\r\nRicardo suspiciously, as one would look at a strange animal--"gentleman\r\ncan win of an evening? Isn\'t as if my customers were a lot of rich men\r\nwith pockets full of cash. I wonder you take so much trouble and risk\r\nfor so little money."\r\n\r\nSchomberg\'s argument was met by Mr. Jones\'s statement that one must do\r\nsomething to kill time. Killing time was not forbidden. For the rest,\r\nbeing in a communicative mood, Mr. Jones said languidly and in a voice\r\nindifferent, as if issuing from a tomb, that he depended on himself, as\r\nif the world were still one great, wild jungle without law. Martin was\r\nsomething like that, too--for reasons of his own.\r\n\r\nAll these statements Ricardo confirmed by short, inhuman grins.\r\nSchomberg lowered his eyes, for the sight of these two men intimidated\r\nhim; but he was losing patience.\r\n\r\n"Of course, I could see at once that you were two desperate\r\ncharacters--something like what you say. But what would you think if\r\nI told you that I am pretty near as desperate as you two gentlemen?\r\n\'Here\'s that Schomberg has an easy time running his hotel,\' people\r\nthink; and yet it seems to me I would just as soon let you rip me open\r\nand burn the whole show as not. There!"\r\n\r\nA low whistle was heard. It came from Ricardo, and was derisive.\r\nSchomberg, breathing heavily, looked on the floor. He was really\r\ndesperate. Mr. Jones remained languidly sceptical.\r\n\r\n"Tut, tut! You have a tolerable business. You are perfectly tame; you--"\r\nHe paused, then added in a tone of disgust: "You have a wife."\r\n\r\nSchomberg tapped the floor angrily with his foot and uttered an\r\nindistinct, laughing curse.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by flinging that damned trouble at my head?" he cried.\r\n"I wish you would carry her off with you some where to the devil! I\r\nwouldn\'t run after you."\r\n\r\nThe unexpected outburst affected Mr. Jones strangely. He had a horrified\r\nrecoil, chair and all, as if Schomberg had thrust a wriggling viper in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this infernal nonsense?" he muttered thickly. "What do you mean?\r\nHow dare you?"\r\n\r\nRicardo chuckled audibly.\r\n\r\n"I tell you I am desperate," Schomberg repeated. "I am as desperate as\r\nany man ever was. I don\'t care a hang what happens to me!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then"--Mr. Jones began to speak with a quietly threatening\r\neffect, as if the common words of daily use had some other deadly\r\nmeaning to his mind--"well, then, why should you make yourself\r\nridiculously disagreeable to us? If you don\'t care, as you say, you\r\nmight just as well let us have the key of that music-shed of yours for\r\na quiet game; a modest bank--a dozen candles or so. It would be greatly\r\nappreciated by your clients, as far as I can judge from the way they\r\nbetted on a game of ecarte I had with that fair, baby-faced man--what\'s\r\nhis name? They just yearn for a modest bank. And I am afraid Martin here\r\nwould take it badly if you objected; but of course you won\'t. Think of\r\nthe calls for drinks!"\r\n\r\nSchomberg, raising his eyes, at last met the gleams in two dark caverns\r\nunder Mr. Jones\'s devilish eyebrows, directed upon him impenetrably. He\r\nshuddered as if horrors worse than murder had been lurking there, and\r\nsaid, nodding towards Ricardo:\r\n\r\n"I dare say he wouldn\'t think twice about sticking me, if he had you at\r\nhis back! I wish I had sunk my launch, and gone to the bottom myself\r\nin her, before I boarded the steamer you came by. Ah, well, I\'ve been\r\nalready living in hell for weeks, so you don\'t make much difference.\r\nI\'ll let you have the concert-room--and hang the consequences. But\r\nwhat about the boy on late duty? If he sees the cards and actual money\r\npassing, he will be sure to blab, and it will be all over the town in no\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nA ghastly smile stirred the lips of Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see you want to make a success of it. Very good. That\'s the way\r\nto get on. Don\'t let it disturb you. You chase all the Chinamen to bed\r\nearly, and we\'ll get Pedro here every evening. He isn\'t the conventional\r\nwaiter\'s cut, but he will do to run to and fro with the tray, while\r\nyou sit here from nine to eleven serving out drinks and gathering the\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"There will be three of them now," thought the unlucky Schomberg.\r\n\r\nBut Pedro, at any rate, was just a simple, straightforward brute, if\r\na murderous one. There was no mystery about him, nothing uncanny, no\r\nsuggestion of a stealthy, deliberate wildcat turned into a man, or of an\r\ninsolent spectre on leave from Hades, endowed with skin and bones and\r\na subtle power of terror. Pedro with his fangs, his tangled beard, and\r\nqueer stare of his little bear\'s eyes was, by comparison, delightfully\r\nnatural. Besides, Schomberg could no longer help himself.\r\n\r\n"That will do very well," he asserted mournfully. "But if you gentlemen,\r\nif you had turned up here only three months ago--ay, less than three\r\nmonths ago--you would have found somebody very different from what I am\r\nnow to talk to you. It\'s true. What do you think of that?"\r\n\r\n"I scarcely know what to think. I should think it was a lie. You were\r\nprobably as tame three months ago as you are now. You were born tame,\r\nlike most people in the world."\r\n\r\nMr Jones got up spectrally, and Ricardo imitated him with a snarl and a\r\nstretch. Schomberg, in a brown study, went on, as if to himself:\r\n\r\n"There has been an orchestra here--eighteen women."\r\n\r\nMr Jones let out an exclamation of dismay, and looked about as if the\r\nwalls around him and the whole house had been infected with plague. Then\r\nhe became very angry, and swore violently at Schomberg for daring to\r\nbring up such subjects. The hotel-keeper was too much surprised to get\r\nup. He gazed from his chair at Mr. Jones\'s anger, which had nothing\r\nspectral in it but was not the more comprehensible for that.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" he stammered out. "What subject? Didn\'t you hear me\r\nsay it was an orchestra? There\'s nothing wrong in that. Well, there was\r\na girl amongst them--" Schomberg\'s eyes went stony; he clasped his hands\r\nin front of his breast with such force that his knuckles came out white.\r\n"Such a girl! Tame, am I? I would have kicked everything to pieces about\r\nme for her. And she, of course . . . I am in the prime of life . . .\r\nthen a fellow bewitched her--a vagabond, a false, lying, swindling,\r\nunderhand, stick-at-nothing brute. Ah!"\r\n\r\nHis entwined fingers cracked as he tore his hands apart, flung out his\r\narms, and leaned his forehead on them in a passion of fury. The other\r\ntwo looked at his shaking back--the attenuated Mr. Jones with mingled\r\nscorn and a sort of fear, Ricardo with the expression of a cat which\r\nsees a piece of fish in the pantry out of reach. Schomberg flung himself\r\nbackwards. He was dry-eyed, but he gulped as if swallowing sobs.\r\n\r\n"No wonder you can do with me what you like. You have no idea--just let\r\nme tell you of my trouble--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to know anything of your beastly trouble," said Mr. Jones,\r\nin his most lifelessly positive voice.\r\n\r\nHe stretched forth an arresting hand, and, as Schomberg remained\r\nopen-mouthed, he walked out of the billiard-room in all the uncanniness\r\nof his thin shanks. Ricardo followed at his leader\'s heels; but he\r\nshowed his teeth to Schomberg over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\nFrom that evening dated those mysterious but significant phenomena in\r\nSchomberg\'s establishment which attracted Captain Davidson\'s casual\r\nnotice when he dropped in, placid yet astute, in order to return\r\nMrs. Schomberg\'s Indian shawl. And strangely enough, they lasted\r\nsome considerable time. It argued either honesty and bad luck or\r\nextraordinary restraint on the part of "plain Mr. Jones and Co." in\r\ntheir discreet operations with cards.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious and impressive sight, the inside of Schomberg\'s\r\nconcert-hall, encumbered at one end by a great stack of chairs piled up\r\non and about the musicians\' platform, and lighted at the other by two\r\ndozen candles disposed about a long trestle table covered with green\r\ncloth. In the middle, Mr. Jones, a starved spectre turned into a banker,\r\nfaced Ricardo, a rather nasty, slow-moving cat turned into a croupier.\r\nBy contrast, the other faces round that table, anything between twenty\r\nand thirty, must have looked like collected samples of intensely\r\nartless, helpless humanity--pathetic in their innocent watch for the\r\nsmall turns of luck which indeed might have been serious enough for\r\nthem. They had no notice to spare for the hairy Pedro, carrying a tray\r\nwith the clumsiness of a creature caught in the woods and taught to walk\r\non its hind legs.\r\n\r\nAs to Schomberg, he kept out of the way. He remained in the\r\nbilliard-room, serving out drinks to the unspeakable Pedro with an air\r\nof not seeing the growling monster, of not knowing where the drinks\r\nwent, of ignoring that there was such a thing as a music-room over there\r\nunder the trees within fifty yards of the hotel. He submitted himself\r\nto the situation with a low-spirited stoicism compounded of fear and\r\nresignation. Directly the party had broken up, (he could see dark\r\nshapes of the men drifting singly and in knots through the gate of\r\nthe compound), he would withdraw out of sight behind a door not quite\r\nclosed, in order to avoid meeting his two extraordinary guests; but he\r\nwould watch through the crack their contrasted forms pass through the\r\nbilliard-room and disappear on their way to bed. Then he would hear\r\ndoors being slammed upstairs; and a profound silence would fall upon the\r\nwhole house, upon his hotel appropriated, haunted by those insolently\r\noutspoken men provided with a whole armoury of weapons in their trunks.\r\nA profound silence. Schomberg sometimes could not resist the notion that\r\nhe must be dreaming. Shuddering, he would pull himself together,\r\nand creep out, with movements strangely inappropriate to the\r\nLieutenant-of-the-Reserve bearing by which he tried to keep up his\r\nself-respect before the world.\r\n\r\nA great loneliness oppressed him. One after another he would extinguish\r\nthe lamps, and move softly towards his bedroom, where Mrs. Schomberg\r\nwaited for him--no fit companion for a man of his ability and "in the\r\nprime of life." But that life, alas, was blighted. He felt it; and never\r\nwith such force as when on opening the door he perceived that woman\r\nsitting patiently in a chair, her toes peeping out under the edge of her\r\nnight-dress, an amazingly small amount of hair on her head drooping\r\non the long stalk of scraggy neck, with that everlasting scared grin\r\nshowing a blue tooth and meaning nothing--not even real fear. For she\r\nwas used to him.\r\n\r\nSometimes he was tempted to screw the head off the stalk. He imagined\r\nhimself doing it--with one hand, a twisting movement. Not seriously, of\r\ncourse. Just a simple indulgence for his exasperated feelings. He wasn\'t\r\ncapable of murder. He was certain of that. And, remembering suddenly the\r\nplain speeches of Mr. Jones, he would think: "I suppose I am too tame\r\nfor that"--quite unaware that he had murdered the poor woman morally\r\nyears ago. He was too unintelligent to have the notion of such a crime.\r\nHer bodily presence was bitterly offensive, because of its contrast with\r\na very different feminine image. And it was no use getting rid of her.\r\nShe was a habit of years, and there would be nothing to put in her\r\nplace. At any rate, he could talk to that idiot half the night if he\r\nchose.\r\n\r\nThat night he had been vapouring before her as to his intention to face\r\nhis two guests and, instead of that inspiration he needed, had merely\r\nreceived the usual warning: "Be careful, Wilhelm." He did not want to be\r\ntold to be careful by an imbecile female. What he needed was a pair of\r\nwoman\'s arms which, flung round his neck, would brace him up for the\r\nencounter. Inspire him, he called it to himself.\r\n\r\nHe lay awake a long time; and his slumbers, when they came, were\r\nunsatisfactory and short. The morning light had no joy for his eyes.\r\nHe listened dismally to the movements in the house. The Chinamen were\r\nunlocking and flinging wide the doors of the public rooms which opened\r\non the veranda. Horrors! Another poisoned day to get through somehow!\r\nThe recollection of his resolve made him feel actually sick for a\r\nmoment. First of all the lordly, abandoned attitudes of Mr. Jones\r\ndisconcerted him. Then there was his contemptuous silence. Mr. Jones\r\nnever addressed himself to Schomberg with any general remarks, never\r\nopened his lips to him unless to say "Good morning"--two simple words\r\nwhich, uttered by that man, seemed a mockery of a threatening character.\r\nAnd, lastly, it was not a frank physical fear he inspired--for as to\r\nthat, even a cornered rat will fight--but a superstitious shrinking awe,\r\nsomething like an invincible repugnance to seek speech with a wicked\r\nghost. That it was a daylight ghost surprisingly angular in his\r\nattitudes, and for the most part spread out on three chairs, did\r\nnot make it any easier. Daylight only made him a more weird, a more\r\ndisturbing and unlawful apparition. Strangely enough in the evening when\r\nhe came out of his mute supineness, this unearthly side of him was less\r\nobtrusive. At the gaming-table, when actually handling the cards, it was\r\nprobably sunk quite out of sight; but Schomberg, having made up his mind\r\nin ostrich-like fashion to ignore what was going on, never entered the\r\ndesecrated music-room. He had never seen Mr. Jones in the exercise of\r\nhis vocation--or perhaps it was only his trade.\r\n\r\n"I will speak to him tonight," Schomberg said to himself, while he drank\r\nhis morning tea, in pyjamas, on the veranda, before the rising sun had\r\ntopped the trees of the compound, and while the undried dew still\r\nlay silvery on the grass, sparkled on the blossoms of the central\r\nflower-bed, and darkened the yellow gravel of the drive. "That\'s what\r\nI\'ll do. I won\'t keep out of sight tonight. I shall come out and catch\r\nhim as he goes to bed carrying the cash-box."\r\n\r\nAfter all, what was the fellow but a common desperado? Murderous? Oh,\r\nyes; murderous enough, perhaps--and the muscles of Schomberg\'s stomach\r\nhad a quivering contraction under his airy attire. But even a common\r\ndesperado would think twice or, more likely, a hundred times, before\r\nopenly murdering an inoffensive citizen in a civilized, European-ruled\r\ntown. He jerked his shoulders. Of course! He shuddered again, and\r\npaddled back to his room to dress himself. His mind was made up, and he\r\nwould think no more about it; but still he had his doubts. They grew and\r\nunfolded themselves with the progress of the day, as some plants do. At\r\ntimes they made him perspire more than usual, and they did away with\r\nthe possibility of his afternoon siesta. After turning over on his couch\r\nmore than a dozen times, he gave up this mockery of repose, got up, and\r\nwent downstairs.\r\n\r\nIt was between three and four o\'clock, the hour of profound peace. The\r\nvery flowers seemed to doze on their stalks set with sleepy leaves. Not\r\neven the air stirred, for the sea-breeze was not due till later. The\r\nservants were out of sight, catching naps in the shade somewhere behind\r\nthe house. Mrs. Schomberg in a dim up-stair room with closed jalousies,\r\nwas elaborating those two long pendant ringlets which were such a\r\nfeature of her hairdressing for her afternoon duties. At that time no\r\ncustomers ever troubled the repose of the establishment. Wandering about\r\nhis premises in profound solitude, Schomberg recoiled at the door of the\r\nbilliard-room, as if he had seen a snake in his path. All alone with the\r\nbilliards, the bare little tables, and a lot of untenanted chairs, Mr.\r\nSecretary Ricardo sat near the wall, performing with lightning rapidity\r\nsomething that looked like tricks with his own personal pack of cards,\r\nwhich he always carried about in his pocket. Schomberg would have backed\r\nout quietly if Ricardo had not turned his head. Having been seen, the\r\nhotel-keeper elected to walk in as the lesser risk of the two. The\r\nconsciousness of his inwardly abject attitude towards these men caused\r\nhim always to throw his chest out and assume a severe expression.\r\nRicardo watched his approach, clasping the pack of cards in both hands.\r\n\r\n"You want something, perhaps?" suggested Schomberg in his\r\nlieutenant-of-the-Reserve voice.\r\n\r\nRicardo shook his head in silence and looked expectant. With him\r\nSchomberg exchanged at least twenty words every day. He was infinitely\r\nmore communicative than his patron. At times he looked very much like\r\nan ordinary human being of his class; and he seemed to be in an amiable\r\nmood at that moment. Suddenly spreading some ten cards face downward in\r\nthe form of a fan, he thrust them towards Schomberg.\r\n\r\n"Come, man, take one quick!"\r\n\r\nSchomberg was so surprised that he took one hurriedly, after a very\r\nperceptible start. The eyes of Martin Ricardo gleamed phosphorescent\r\nin the half-light of the room screened from the heat and glare of the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the king of hearts you\'ve got," he chuckled, showing his teeth\r\nin a quick flash.\r\n\r\nSchomberg, after looking at the card, admitted that it was, and laid it\r\ndown on the table.\r\n\r\n"I can make you take any card I like nine times out of ten," exulted the\r\nsecretary, with a strange curl of his lips and a green flicker in his\r\nraised eyes.\r\n\r\nSchomberg looked down at him dumbly. For a few seconds neither of them\r\nstirred; then Ricardo lowered his glance, and, opening his fingers,\r\nlet the whole pack fall on the table. Schomberg sat down. He sat down\r\nbecause of the faintness in his legs, and for no other reason. His mouth\r\nwas dry. Having sat down, he felt that he must speak. He squared his\r\nshoulders in parade style.\r\n\r\n"You are pretty good at that sort of thing," he said.\r\n\r\n"Practice makes perfect," replied the secretary.\r\n\r\nHis precarious amiability made it impossible for Schomberg to get away.\r\nThus, from his very timidity, the hotel-keeper found himself engaged\r\nin a conversation the thought of which filled him with apprehension. It\r\nmust be said, in justice to Schomberg, that he concealed his funk very\r\ncreditably. The habit of throwing out his chest and speaking in a severe\r\nvoice stood him in good stead. With him, too, practice made perfect; and\r\nhe would probably have kept it up to the end, to the very last moment,\r\nto the ultimate instant of breaking strain which would leave him\r\ngrovelling on the floor. To add to his secret trouble, he was at a loss\r\nwhat to say. He found nothing else but the remark:\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are fond of cards."\r\n\r\n"What would you expect?" asked Ricardo in a simple, philosophical tone.\r\n"It is likely I should not be?" Then, with sudden fire: "Fond of cards?\r\nAy, passionately!"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this outburst was augmented by the quiet lowering of the\r\neyelids, by a reserved pause as though this had been a confession of\r\nanother kind of love. Schomberg cudgelled his brains for a new topic,\r\nbut he could not find one. His usual scandalous gossip would not serve\r\nthis turn. That desperado did not know anyone anywhere within a thousand\r\nmiles. Schomberg was almost compelled to keep to the subject.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'ve always been so--from your early youth."\r\n\r\nRicardo\'s eyes remained cast down. His fingers toyed absently with the\r\npack on the table.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it was so early. I first got in the way of it playing\r\nfor tobacco--in forecastles of ships, you know--common sailor games. We\r\nused to spend whole watches below at it, round a chest, under a\r\nslush lamp. We would hardly spare the time to get a bite of salt\r\nhorse--neither eat nor sleep. We could hardly stand when the watches\r\nwere mustered on deck. Talk of gambling!" He dropped the reminiscent\r\ntone to add the information, "I was bred to the sea from a boy, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nSchomberg had fallen into a reverie, but without losing the sense of\r\nimpending calamity. The next words he heard were:\r\n\r\n"I got on all right at sea, too. Worked up to be mate. I was mate of a\r\nschooner--a yacht, you might call her--a special good berth too, in the\r\nGulf of Mexico, a soft job that you don\'t run across more than once in a\r\nlifetime. Yes, I was mate of her when I left the sea to follow him."\r\n\r\nRicardo tossed up his chin to indicate the room above; from which\r\nSchomberg, his wits painfully aroused by this reminder of Mr. Jones\'s\r\nexistence, concluded that the latter had withdrawn into his bedroom.\r\nRicardo, observing him from under lowered eyelids, went on:\r\n\r\n"It so happened that we were shipmates."\r\n\r\n"Mr Jones, you mean? Is he a sailor too?"\r\n\r\nRicardo raised his eyelids at that.\r\n\r\n"He\'s no more Mr. Jones than you are," he said with obvious pride. "He a\r\nsailor! That just shows your ignorance. But there! A foreigner can\'t be\r\nexpected to know any better. I am an Englishman, and I know a gentleman\r\nat sight. I should know one drunk, in the gutter, in jail, under the\r\ngallows. There\'s a something--it isn\'t exactly the appearance, it\'s\r\na--no use me trying to tell you. You ain\'t an Englishman, and if you\r\nwere, you wouldn\'t need to be told."\r\n\r\nAn unsuspected stream of loquacity had broken its dam somewhere deep\r\nwithin the man, had diluted his fiery blood and softened his pitiless\r\nfibre. Schomberg experienced mingled relief and apprehension, as if\r\nsuddenly an enormous savage cat had begun to wind itself about his legs\r\nin inexplicable friendliness. No prudent man under such circumstances\r\nwould dare to stir. Schomberg didn\'t stir. Ricardo assumed an easy\r\nattitude, with an elbow on the table. Schomberg squared his shoulders\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\n"I was employed, in that there yacht--schooner, whatever you call it--by\r\nten gentlemen at once. That surprises you, eh? Yes, yes, ten. Leastwise\r\nthere were nine of them gents good enough in their way, and one\r\ndownright gentleman, and that was . . ."\r\n\r\nRicardo gave another upward jerk of his chin as much as to say: He! The\r\nonly one.\r\n\r\n"And no mistake," he went on. "I spotted him from the first day. How?\r\nWhy? Ay, you may ask. Hadn\'t seen that many gentlemen in my life. Well,\r\nsomehow I did. If you were an Englishman, you would--"\r\n\r\n"What was your yacht?" Schomberg interrupted as impatiently as he dared;\r\nfor this harping on nationality jarred on his already tried nerves.\r\n"What was the game?"\r\n\r\n"You have a headpiece on you! Game! \'Xactly. That\'s what it was--the\r\nsort of silliness gentlemen will get up among themselves to play at\r\nadventure. A treasure-hunting expedition. Each of them put down so much\r\nmoney, you understand, to buy the schooner. Their agent in the city\r\nengaged me and the skipper. The greatest secrecy and all that. I reckon\r\nhe had a twinkle in his eye all the time--and no mistake. But that\r\nwasn\'t our business. Let them bust their money as they like. The pity of\r\nit was that so little of it came our way. Just fair pay and no more. And\r\ndamn any pay, much or little, anyhow--that\'s what I say!"\r\n\r\nHe blinked his eyes greenishly in the dim light. The heat seemed to\r\nhave stilled everything in the world but his voice. He swore at large,\r\nabundantly, in snarling undertones, it was impossible to say why, then\r\ncalmed down as inexplicably, and went on, as a sailor yarns.\r\n\r\n"At first there were only nine of them adventurous sparks, then, just a\r\nday or two before the sailing date, he turned up. Heard of it somehow,\r\nsomewhere--I would say from some woman, if I didn\'t know him as I do. He\r\nwould give any woman a ten-mile berth. He can\'t stand them. Or maybe in\r\na flash bar. Or maybe in one of them grand clubs in Pall Mall. Anyway,\r\nthe agent netted him in all right--cash down, and only about four and\r\ntwenty hours for him to get ready; but he didn\'t miss his ship. Not he!\r\nYou might have called it a pier-head jump--for a gentleman. I saw him\r\ncome along. Know the West India Docks, eh?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg did not know the West India Docks. Ricardo looked at him\r\npensively for a while, and then continued, as if such ignorance had to\r\nbe disregarded.\r\n\r\n"Our tug was already alongside. Two loafers were carrying his dunnage\r\nbehind him. I told the dockman at our moorings to keep all fast for a\r\nminute. The gangway was down already; but he made nothing of it. Up he\r\njumps, one leap, swings his long legs over the rail, and there he is\r\non board. They pass up his swell dunnage, and he puts his hand in his\r\ntrousers pocket and throws all his small change on the wharf for them\r\nchaps to pick up. They were still promenading that wharf on all fours\r\nwhen we cast off. It was only then that he looked at me--quietly, you\r\nknow; in a slow way. He wasn\'t so thin then as he is now; but I noticed\r\nhe wasn\'t so young as he looked--not by a long chalk. He seemed to touch\r\nme inside somewhere. I went away pretty quick from there; I was wanted\r\nforward anyhow. I wasn\'t frightened. What should I be frightened for? I\r\nonly felt touched--on the very spot. But Jee-miny, if anybody had told\r\nme we should be partners before the year was out--well, I would have--"\r\n\r\nHe swore a variety of strange oaths, some common, others quaintly\r\nhorrible to Schomberg\'s ears, and all mere innocent exclamations of\r\nwonder at the shifts and changes of human fortune. Schomberg moved\r\nslightly in his chair. But the admirer and partner of "plain Mr. Jones"\r\nseemed to have forgotten Schomberg\'s existence for the moment. The\r\nstream of ingenuous blasphemy--some of it in bad Spanish--had run dry,\r\nand Martin Ricardo, connoisseur in gentlemen, sat dumb with a stony gaze\r\nas if still marvelling inwardly at the amazing elections, conjunctions,\r\nand associations of events which influence man\'s pilgrimage on this\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAt last Schomberg spoke tentatively:\r\n\r\n"And so the--the gentleman, up there, talked you over into leaving a\r\ngood berth?"\r\n\r\nRicardo started.\r\n\r\n"Talked me over! Didn\'t need to talk me over. Just beckoned to me, and\r\nthat was enough. By that time we were in the Gulf of Mexico. One night\r\nwe were lying at anchor, close to a dry sandbank--to this day I am not\r\nsure where it was--off the Colombian coast or thereabouts. We were\r\nto start digging the next morning, and all hands had turned in early,\r\nexpecting a hard day with the shovels. Up he comes, and in his quiet,\r\ntired way of speaking--you can tell a gentleman by that as much as by\r\nanything else almost--up he comes behind me and says, just like that\r\ninto my ear, in a manner: \'Well, what do you think of our treasure hunt\r\nnow?\'\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t even turn my head; \'xactly as I stood, I remained, and I spoke\r\nno louder than himself:\r\n\r\n"\'If you want to know, sir, it\'s nothing but just damned tom-foolery.\'\r\n\r\n"We had, of course, been having short talks together at one time or\r\nanother during the passage. I dare say he had read me like a book. There\r\nain\'t much to me, except that I have never been tame, even when walking\r\nthe pavement and cracking jokes and standing drinks to chums--ay, and to\r\nstrangers, too. I would watch them lifting their elbows at my expense,\r\nor splitting their side at my fun--I can be funny when I like, you bet!"\r\n\r\nA pause for self-complacent contemplation of his own fun and generosity\r\nchecked the flow of Ricardo\'s speech. Schomberg was concerned to keep\r\nwithin bounds the enlargement of his eyes, which he seemed to feel\r\ngrowing bigger in his head.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he whispered hastily.\r\n\r\n"I would watch them and think: \'You boys don\'t know who I am. If you\r\ndid--!\' With girls, too. Once I was courting a girl. I used to kiss her\r\nbehind the ear and say to myself: \'If you only knew who\'s kissing you,\r\nmy dear, you would scream and bolt!\' Ha! ha! Not that I wanted to\r\ndo them any harm; but I felt the power in myself. Now, here we sit,\r\nfriendly like, and that\'s all right. You aren\'t in my way. But I am not\r\nfriendly to you. I just don\'t care. Some men do say that; but I really\r\ndon\'t. You are no more to me one way or another than that fly there.\r\nJust so. I\'d squash you or leave you alone. I don\'t care what I do."\r\n\r\nIf real force of character consists in overcoming our sudden weaknesses,\r\nSchomberg displayed plenty of that quality. At the mention of the fly,\r\nhe re-enforced the severe dignity of his attitude as one inflates a\r\ncollapsing toy balloon with a great effort of breath. The easy-going,\r\nrelaxed attitude of Ricardo was really appalling.\r\n\r\n"That\'s so," he went on. "I am that sort of fellow. You wouldn\'t think\r\nit, would you? No. You have to be told. So I am telling you, and I dare\r\nsay you only half believe it. But you can\'t say to yourself that I am\r\ndrunk, stare at me as you may. I haven\'t had anything stronger than a\r\nglass of iced water all day. Takes a real gentleman to see through a\r\nfellow. Oh, yes--he spotted me. I told you we had a few talks at sea\r\nabout one thing or another. And I used to watch him down the skylight,\r\nplaying cards in the cuddy with the others. They had to pass the time\r\naway somehow. By the same token he caught me at it once, and it was then\r\nthat I told him I was fond of cards--and generally lucky in gambling,\r\ntoo. Yes, he had sized me up. Why not? A gentleman\'s just like any other\r\nman--and something more."\r\n\r\nIt flashed through Schomberg\'s mind: that these two were indeed well\r\nmatched in their enormous dissimilarity, identical souls in different\r\ndisguises.\r\n\r\n"Says he to me"--Ricardo started again in a gossiping manner--\'I\'m\r\npacked up. It\'s about time to go, Martin.\'\r\n\r\n"It was the first time he called me Martin. Says I:\r\n\r\n"\'Is that it, sir?\'\r\n\r\n"\'You didn\'t think I was after that sort of treasure, did you? I wanted\r\nto clear out from home quietly. It\'s a pretty expensive way of getting a\r\npassage across, but it has served my turn.\'\r\n\r\n"I let him know very soon that I was game for anything, from pitch and\r\ntoss to wilful murder, in his company.\r\n\r\n"\'Wilful murder?\' says he in his quiet way. \'What the deuce is that?\r\nWhat are you talking about? People do get killed sometimes when they get\r\nin one\'s way, but that\'s self-defence--you understand?\'\r\n\r\n"I told him I did. And then I said I would run below for a minute, to\r\nram a few of my things into a sailor\'s bag I had. I\'ve never cared for\r\na lot of dunnage; I believed in going about flying light when I was at\r\nsea. I came back and found him strolling up and down the deck, as if\r\nhe were taking a breath of fresh air before turning in, like any other\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n"\'Ready?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t even look at me. We had had a boat in the water astern ever\r\nsince we came to anchor in the afternoon. He throws the stump of his\r\ncigar overboard.\r\n\r\n"\'Can you get the captain out on deck?\' he asks.\r\n\r\n"That was the last thing in the world I should have thought of doing. I\r\nlost my tongue for a moment.\r\n\r\n"\'I can try,\' says I.\r\n\r\n"\'Well, then, I am going below. You get him up and keep him with you\r\ntill I come back on deck. Mind! Don\'t let him go below till I return.\'\r\n\r\n"I could not help asking why he told me to rouse a sleeping man, when\r\nwe wanted everybody on board to sleep sweetly till we got clear of the\r\nschooner. He laughs a little and says that I didn\'t see all the bearings\r\nof this business.\r\n\r\n"\'Mind,\' he says, \'don\'t let him leave you till you see me come up\r\nagain.\' He puts his eyes close to mine. \'Keep him with you at all\r\ncosts.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And that means?\' says I.\r\n\r\n"\'All costs to him--by every possible or impossible means. I don\'t want\r\nto be interrupted in my business down below. He would give me lots\r\nof trouble. I take you with me to save myself trouble in various\r\ncircumstances; and you\'ve got to enter on your work right away.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Just so, sir,\' says I; and he slips down the companion.\r\n\r\n"With a gentleman you know at once where you are; but it was a ticklish\r\njob. The skipper was nothing to me one way or another, any more than you\r\nare at this moment, Mr. Schomberg. You may light your cigar or blow your\r\nbrains out this minute, and I don\'t care a hang which you do, both or\r\nneither. To bring the skipper up was easy enough. I had only to stamp on\r\nthe deck a few times over his head. I stamped hard. But how to keep him\r\nup when he got there?\r\n\r\n"\'Anything the matter; Mr. Ricardo?\' I heard his voice behind me.\r\n\r\n"There he was, and I hadn\'t thought of anything to say to him; so I\r\ndidn\'t turn round. The moonlight was brighter than many a day I could\r\nremember in the North Sea.\r\n\r\n"\'Why did you call me? What are you staring at out there, Mr. Ricardo?\'\r\n\r\n"He was deceived by my keeping my back to him. I wasn\'t staring at\r\nanything, but his mistake gave me a notion.\r\n\r\n"\'I am staring at something that looks like a canoe over there,\' I said\r\nvery slowly.\r\n\r\n"The skipper got concerned at once. It wasn\'t any danger from the\r\ninhabitants, whoever they were.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, hang it!\' says he. \'That\'s very unfortunate.\' He had hoped that\r\nthe schooner being on the coast would not get known so very soon.\r\n\'Dashed awkward, with the business we\'ve got in hand, to have a lot of\r\nniggers watching operations. But are you certain this is a canoe?\'\r\n\r\n"\'It may be a drift-log,\' I said; \'but I thought you had better have a\r\nlook with your own eyes. You may make it out better than I can.\'\r\n\r\n"His eyes weren\'t anything as good as mine. But he says:\r\n\r\n"\'Certainly. Certainly. You did quite right.\'\r\n\r\n"And it\'s a fact I had seen some drift-logs at sunset. I saw what they\r\nwere then and didn\'t trouble my head about them, forgot all about it\r\ntill that very moment. Nothing strange in seeing drift-logs off a coast\r\nlike that; and I\'m hanged if the skipper didn\'t make one out in the\r\nwake of the moon. Strange what a little thing a man\'s life hangs on\r\nsometimes--a single word! Here you are, sitting unsuspicious before me,\r\nand you may let out something unbeknown to you that would settle your\r\nhash. Not that I have any ill-feeling. I have no feelings. If the\r\nskipper had said, \'O, bosh!\' and had turned his back on me, he would not\r\nhave gone three steps towards his bed; but he stood there and stared.\r\nAnd now the job was to get him off the deck when he was no longer wanted\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"\'We are just trying to make out if that object there is a canoe or a\r\nlog,\' says he to Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\n"Mr Jones had come up, lounging as carelessly as when he went below.\r\nWhile the skipper was jawing about boats and drifting logs. I asked by\r\nsigns, from behind, if I hadn\'t better knock him on the head and drop\r\nhim quietly overboard. The night was slipping by, and we had to go. It\r\ncouldn\'t be put off till next night no more. No. No more. And do you\r\nknow why?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg made a slight negative sign with his head. This direct appeal\r\nannoyed him, jarred on the induced quietude of a great talker forced\r\ninto the part of a listener and sunk in it as a man sinks into slumber.\r\nMr. Ricardo struck a note of scorn.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know why? Can\'t you guess? No? Because the boss had got hold of\r\nthe skipper\'s cash-box by then. See?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n "A common thief!"\r\n\r\nSchomberg bit his tongue just too late, and woke up completely as he saw\r\nRicardo retract his lips in a cat-like grin; but the companion of "plain\r\nMr. Jones" didn\'t alter his comfortable, gossiping attitude.\r\n\r\n"Garn! What if he did want to see his money back, like any tame\r\nshopkeeper, hash-seller, gin-slinger, or ink-spewer does? Fancy a mud\r\nturtle like you trying to pass an opinion on a gentleman! A gentleman\r\nisn\'t to be sized up so easily. Even I ain\'t up to it sometimes. For\r\ninstance, that night, all he did was to waggle his finger at me. The\r\nskipper stops his silly chatter, surprised.\r\n\r\n"\'Eh? What\'s the matter?\' asks he.\r\n\r\n"The matter! It was his reprieve--that\'s what was the matter.\r\n\r\n"\'O, nothing, nothing,\' says my gentleman. \'You are perfectly right. A\r\nlog--nothing but a log.\'\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! Reprieve, I call it, because if the skipper had gone on with\r\nhis silly argument much longer he would have had to be knocked out\r\nof the way. I could hardly hold myself in on account of the precious\r\nminutes. However, his guardian angel put it into his head to shut up and\r\ngo back to his bed. I was ramping mad about the lost time."\r\n\r\n"\'Why didn\'t you let me give him one on his silly coconut sir?\' I asks.\r\n\r\n"\'No ferocity, no ferocity,\' he says, raising his finger at me as calm\r\nas you please.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t tell how a gentleman takes that sort of thing. They don\'t\r\nlose their temper. It\'s bad form. You\'ll never see him lose his\r\ntemper--not for anybody to see anyhow. Ferocity ain\'t good form,\r\neither--that much I\'ve learned by this time, and more, too. I\'ve had\r\nthat schooling that you couldn\'t tell by my face if I meant to rip you\r\nup the next minute--as of course I could do in less than a jiffy. I have\r\na knife up the leg of my trousers."\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t!" exclaimed Schomberg incredulously.\r\n\r\nMr Ricardo was as quick as lightning in changing his lounging, idle\r\nattitude for a stooping position, and exhibiting the weapon with one\r\njerk at the left leg of his trousers. Schomberg had just a view of it,\r\nstrapped to a very hairy limb, when Mr. Ricardo, jumping up, stamped his\r\nfoot to get the trouser-leg down, and resumed his careless pose with one\r\nelbow on the table.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a more handy way to carry a tool than you would think," he went\r\non, gazing abstractedly into Schomberg\'s wide-open eyes. "Suppose some\r\nlittle difference comes up during a game. Well, you stoop to pick up a\r\ndropped card, and when you come up--there you are ready to strike, or\r\nwith the thing up you sleeve ready to throw. Or you just dodge under the\r\ntable when there\'s some shooting coming. You wouldn\'t believe the damage\r\na fellow with a knife under the table can do to ill-conditioned skunks\r\nthat want to raise trouble, before they begin to understand what the\r\nscreaming\'s about, and make a bolt--those that can, that is."\r\n\r\nThe roses of Schomberg\'s cheek at the root of his chestnut beard faded\r\nperceptibly. Ricardo chuckled faintly.\r\n\r\n"But no ferocity--no ferocity! A gentleman knows. What\'s the good of\r\ngetting yourself into a state? And no shirking necessity, either. No\r\ngentleman ever shirks. What I learn I don\'t forget. Why! We gambled\r\non the plains, with a damn lot of cattlemen in ranches; played fair,\r\nmind--and then had to fight for our winnings afterwards as often as not.\r\nWe\'ve gambled on the hills and in the valleys and on the sea-shore, and\r\nout of sight of land--mostly fair. Generally it\'s good enough. We began\r\nin Nicaragua first, after we left that schooner and her fool errand.\r\nThere were one hundred and twenty-seven sovereigns and some Mexican\r\ndollars in that skipper\'s cash-box. Hardly enough to knock a man on the\r\nhead for from behind, I must confess; but that the skipper had a narrow\r\nescape the governor himself could not deny afterwards.\r\n\r\n"\'Do you want me to understand, sir, that you mind there being one life\r\nmore or less on this earth?\' I asked him, a few hours after we got away.\r\n\r\n"\'Certainly not,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'Well, then, why did you stop me?\'\r\n\r\n"\'There\'s a proper way of doing things. You\'ll have to learn to be\r\ncorrect. There\'s also unnecessary exertion. That must be avoided,\r\ntoo--if only for the look of the thing.\' A gentleman\'s way of putting\r\nthings to you--and no mistake!\r\n\r\n"At sunrise we got into a creek, to lie hidden in case the treasure hunt\r\nparty had a mind to take a spell hunting for us. And dash me if they\r\ndidn\'t! We saw the schooner away out, running to leeward, with ten pairs\r\nof binoculars sweeping the sea, no doubt on all sides. I advised the\r\ngovernor to give her time to beat back again before we made a start. So\r\nwe stayed up that creek something like ten days, as snug as can be. On\r\nthe seventh day we had to kill a man, though--the brother of this Pedro\r\nhere. They were alligator-hunters, right enough. We got our lodgings in\r\ntheir hut. Neither the boss nor I could habla Espanol--speak Spanish,\r\nyou know--much then. Dry bank, nice shade, jolly hammocks, fresh fish,\r\ngood game, everything lovely. The governor chucked them a few dollars to\r\nbegin with; but it was like boarding with a pair of savage apes, anyhow.\r\nBy and by we noticed them talking a lot together. They had twigged\r\nthe cash-box, and the leather portmanteaus, and my bag--a jolly lot of\r\nplunder to look at. They must have been saying to each other:\r\n\r\n"\'No one\'s ever likely to come looking for these two fellows, who seem\r\nto have fallen from the moon. Let\'s cut their throats.\'\r\n\r\n"Why, of course! Clear as daylight. I didn\'t need to spy one of them\r\nsharpening a devilish long knife behind some bushes, while glancing\r\nright and left with his wild eyes, to know what was in the wind. Pedro\r\nwas standing by, trying the edge of another long knife. They thought we\r\nwere away on our lookout at the mouth of the river, as was usual with us\r\nduring the day. Not that we expected to see much of the schooner, but\r\nit was just as well to make certain, if possible; and then it was cooler\r\nout of the woods, in the breeze. Well, the governor was there right\r\nenough, lying comfortable on a rug, where he could watch the offing, but\r\nI had gone back to the hut to get a chew of tobacco out of my bag. I had\r\nnot broken myself of the habit then, and I couldn\'t be happy unless I\r\nhad a lump as big as a baby\'s fist in my cheek."\r\n\r\nAt the cannibalistic comparison, Schomberg muttered a faint, sickly\r\n"don\'t." Ricardo hitched himself up in his seat and glanced down his\r\noutstretched legs complacently.\r\n\r\n"I am tolerably light on my feet, as a general thing," he went on. "Dash\r\nme if I don\'t think I could drop a pinch of salt on a sparrow\'s tail,\r\nif I tried. Anyhow, they didn\'t hear me. I watched them two brown, hairy\r\nbrutes not ten yards off. All they had on was white linen drawers rolled\r\nup on their thighs. Not a word they said to each other. Antonio was\r\ndown on his thick hams, busy rubbing a knife on a flat stone; Pedro was\r\nleaning against a small tree and passing his thumb along the edge of his\r\nblade. I got away quieter than a mouse, you bet."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say anything to the boss then. He was leaning on his elbow\r\non his rug, and didn\'t seem to want to be spoken to. He\'s like\r\nthat--sometimes that familiar you might think he would eat out of your\r\nhand, and at others he would snub you sharper than a devil--but always\r\nquiet. Perfect gentleman, I tell you. I didn\'t bother him, then; but\r\nI wasn\'t likely to forget them two fellows, so businesslike with their\r\nknives. At that time we had only one revolver between us two--the\r\ngovernor\'s six-shooter, but loaded only in five chambers; and we had no\r\nmore cartridges. He had left the box behind in a drawer in his cabin.\r\nAwkward! I had nothing but an old clasp-knife--no good at all for\r\nanything serious.\r\n\r\n"In the evening we four sat round a bit of fire outside the\r\nsleeping-shed, eating broiled fish off plantain leaves, with roast yams\r\nfor bread--the usual thing. The governor and I were on one side, and\r\nthese two beauties cross-legged on the other, grunting a word or two\r\nto each other, now and then, hardly human speech at all, and their eyes\r\ndown, fast on the ground. For the last three days we couldn\'t get them\r\nto look us in the face. Presently I began to talk to the boss quietly,\r\njust as I am talking to you now, careless like, and I told him all I had\r\nobserved. He goes on picking up pieces of fish and putting them into his\r\nmouth as calm as anything. It\'s a pleasure to have anything to do with a\r\ngentleman. Never looked across at them once.\r\n\r\n"\'And now,\' says I, yawning on purpose, \'we\'ve got to stand watch at\r\nnight, turn about, and keep our eyes skinned all day, too, and mind we\r\ndon\'t get jumped upon suddenly.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s perfectly intolerable,\' says the governor. \'And you with no\r\nweapon of any sort!\'\r\n\r\n"\'I mean to stick pretty close to you, sir, from this on, if you don\'t\r\nmind,\' says I.\r\n\r\n"He just nods the least bit, wipes his fingers on the plantain leaf,\r\nputs his hand behind his back, as if to help himself to rise from the\r\nground, snatches his revolver from under his jacket and plugs a bullet\r\nplumb centre into Mr. Antonio\'s chest. See what it is to have to do with\r\na gentleman. No confounded fuss, and things done out of hand. But he\r\nmight have tipped me a wink or something. I nearly jumped out of my\r\nskin. Scared ain\'t in it! I didn\'t even know who had fired. Everything\r\nhad been so still just before that the bang of the shot seemed\r\nthe loudest noise I had ever heard. The honourable Antonio pitches\r\nforward--they always do, towards the shot; you must have noticed that\r\nyourself--yes, he pitches forward on to the embers, and all that lot of\r\nhair on his face and head flashes up like a pinch of gunpowder. Greasy,\r\nI expect; always scraping the fat off them alligators\' hides--"\r\n\r\n"Look here," exclaimed Schomberg violently, as if trying to burst some\r\ninvisible bonds, "do you mean to say that all this happened?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Ricardo coolly. "I am making it all up as I go along, just to\r\nhelp you through the hottest part of the afternoon. So down he pitches\r\nhis nose on the red embers, and up jumps our handsome Pedro and I at the\r\nsame time, like two Jacks-in-the-box. He starts to bolt away, with his\r\nhead over his shoulder, and I, hardly knowing what I was doing, spring\r\non his back. I had the sense to get my hands round his neck at once, and\r\nit\'s about all I could do to lock my fingers tight under his jaw. You\r\nsaw the beauty\'s neck, didn\'t you? Hard as iron, too. Down we both went.\r\nSeeing this the governor puts his revolver in his pocket.\r\n\r\n"\'Tie his legs together, sir,\' I yell. \'I\'m trying to strangle him.\'\r\n\r\n"There was a lot of their fibre-lines lying about. I gave him a last\r\nsqueeze and then got up.\r\n\r\n"\'I might have shot you,\' says the governor, quite concerned.\r\n\r\n"\'But you are glad to have saved a cartridge, sir,\' I tell him.\r\n\r\n"My jump did save it. It wouldn\'t have done to let him get away in\r\nthe dark like that, and have the beauty dodging around in the bushes,\r\nperhaps, with the rusty flint-lock gun they had. The governor owned up\r\nthat the jump was the correct thing.\r\n\r\n"\'But he isn\'t dead,\' says he, bending over him.\r\n\r\n"Might as well hope to strangle an ox. We made haste to tie his elbows\r\nback, and then, before he came to himself, we dragged him to a small\r\ntree, sat him up, and bound him to it, not by the waist but by the\r\nneck--some twenty turns of small line round his throat and the trunk,\r\nfinished off with a reef-knot under his ear. Next thing we did was to\r\nattend to the honourable Antonio, who was making a great smell frizzling\r\nhis face on the red coals. We pushed and rolled him into the creek, and\r\nleft the rest to the alligators.\r\n\r\n"I was tired. That little scrap took it out of me something awful. The\r\ngovernor hadn\'t turned a hair. That\'s where a gentleman has the pull\r\nof you. He don\'t get excited. No gentleman does--or hardly ever. I fell\r\nasleep all of a sudden and left him smoking by the fire I had made\r\nup, his railway rug round his legs, as calm as if he were sitting in a\r\nfirst-class carriage. We hardly spoke ten words to each other after\r\nit was over, and from that day to this we have never talked of the\r\nbusiness. I wouldn\'t have known he remembered it if he hadn\'t alluded to\r\nit when talking with you the other day--you know, with regard to Pedro."\r\n\r\n"It surprised you, didn\'t it? That\'s why I am giving you this yarn of\r\nhow he came to be with us, like a sort of dog--dashed sight more useful,\r\nthough. You know how he can trot around with trays? Well, he could bring\r\ndown an ox with his fist, at a word from the boss, just as cleverly. And\r\nfond of the governor! Oh, my word! More than any dog is of any man."\r\n\r\nSchomberg squared his chest.\r\n\r\n"Oh, and that\'s one of the things I wanted to mention to Mr. Jones," he\r\nsaid. "It\'s unpleasant to have that fellow round the house so early. He\r\nsits on the stairs at the back for hours before he is needed here, and\r\nfrightens people so that the service suffers. The Chinamen--"\r\n\r\nRicardo nodded and raised his hand.\r\n\r\n"When I first saw him he was fit to frighten a grizzly bear, let alone\r\na Chinaman. He\'s become civilized now to what he once was. Well, that\r\nmorning, first thing on opening my eyes, I saw him sitting there, tied\r\nup by the neck to the tree. He was blinking. We spent the day watching\r\nthe sea, and we actually made out the schooner working to windward,\r\nwhich showed that she had given us up. Good! When the sun rose again, I\r\ntook a squint at our Pedro. He wasn\'t blinking. He was rolling his eyes,\r\nall white one minute and black the next, and his tongue was hanging out\r\na yard. Being tied up short by the neck like this would daunt the arch\r\ndevil himself--in time--in time, mind! I don\'t know but that even a\r\nreal gentleman would find it difficult to keep a stiff lip to the end.\r\nPresently we went to work getting our boat ready. I was busying myself\r\nsetting up the mast, when the governor passes the remark:\r\n\r\n"\'I think he wants to say something.\'\r\n\r\n"I had heard a sort of croaking going on for some time, only I wouldn\'t\r\ntake any notice; but then I got out of the boat and went up to him, with\r\nsome water. His eyes were red--red and black and half out of his\r\nhead. He drank all the water I gave him, but he hadn\'t much to say for\r\nhimself. I walked back to the governor.\r\n\r\n"\'He asks for a bullet in his head before we go,\' I said. I wasn\'t at\r\nall pleased.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, that\'s out of the question altogether,\' says the governor.\r\n\r\n"He was right there. Only four shots left, and ninety miles of wild\r\ncoast to put behind us before coming to the first place where you could\r\nexpect to buy revolver cartridges.\r\n\r\n"\'Anyhow,\' I tells him, \'he wants to be killed some way or other, as a\r\nfavour.\'\r\n\r\n"And then I go on setting up the boat\'s mast. I didn\'t care much for the\r\nnotion of butchering a man bound hand and foot and fastened by the neck\r\nbesides. I had a knife then--the honourable Antonio\'s knife; and that\r\nknife is this knife.\r\n\r\n"Ricardo gave his leg a resounding slap.\r\n\r\n"First spoil in my new life," he went on with harsh joviality. "The\r\ndodge of carrying it down there I learned later. I carried it stuck in\r\nmy belt that day. No, I hadn\'t much stomach for the job; but when you\r\nwork with a gentleman of the real right sort you may depend on your\r\nfeelings being seen through your skin. Says the governor suddenly:\r\n\r\n"\'It may even be looked upon as his right\'--you hear a gentleman\r\nspeaking there?--\'but what do you think of taking him with us in the\r\nboat?\'\r\n\r\n"And the governor starts arguing that the beggar would be useful in\r\nworking our way along the coast. We could get rid of him before coming\r\nto the first place that was a little civilized. I didn\'t want much\r\ntalking over. Out I scrambled from the boat.\r\n\r\n"\'Ay, but will he be manageable, sir?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, yes. He\'s daunted. Go on, cut him loose--I take the\r\nresponsibility.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Right you are, sir.\'\r\n\r\n"He sees me come along smartly with his brother\'s knife in my hand--I\r\nwasn\'t thinking how it looked from his side of the fence, you know--and\r\njiminy, it nearly killed him! He stared like a crazed bullock and began\r\nto sweat and twitch all over, something amazing. I was so surprised,\r\nthat I stopped to look at him. The drops were pouring over his eyebrows,\r\ndown his beard, off his nose--and he gurgled. Then it struck me that he\r\ncouldn\'t see what was in my mind. By favour or by right he didn\'t like\r\nto die when it came to it; not in that way, anyhow. When I stepped round\r\nto get at the lashing, he let out a sort of soft bellow. Thought I was\r\ngoing to stick him from behind, I guess. I cut all the turns with one\r\nslash, and he went over on his side, flop, and started kicking with his\r\ntied legs. Laugh! I don\'t know what there was so funny about it, but I\r\nfairly shouted. What between my laughing and his wriggling, I had a job\r\nin cutting him free. As soon as he could feel his limbs he makes for the\r\nbank, where the governor was standing, crawls up to him on his hands and\r\nknees, and embraces his legs. Gratitude, eh? You could see that being\r\nallowed to live suited that chap down to the ground. The governor gets\r\nhis legs away from him gently and just mutters to me:\r\n\r\n"\'Let\'s be off. Get him into the boat.\'\r\n\r\n"It was not difficult," continued Ricardo, after eyeing Schomberg\r\nfixedly for a moment. "He was ready enough to get into the boat,\r\nand--here he is. He would let himself be chopped into small pieces--with\r\na smile, mind; with a smile!--for the governor. I don\'t know about him\r\ndoing that much for me; but pretty near, pretty near. I did the tying up\r\nand the untying, but he could see who was the boss. And then he knows a\r\ngentleman. A dog knows a gentleman--any dog. It\'s only some foreigners\r\nthat don\'t know; and nothing can teach them, either."\r\n\r\n"And you mean to say," asked Schomberg, disregarding what might have\r\nbeen annoying for himself in the emphasis of the final remark, "you mean\r\nto say that you left steady employment at good wages for a life like\r\nthis?"\r\n\r\n"There!" began Ricardo quietly. "That\'s just what a man like you would\r\nsay. You are that tame! I follow a gentleman. That ain\'t the same thing\r\nas to serve an employer. They give you wages as they\'d fling a bone to\r\na dog, and they expect you to be grateful. It\'s worse than slavery. You\r\ndon\'t expect a slave that\'s bought for money to be grateful. And if you\r\nsell your work--what is it but selling your own self? You\'ve got so many\r\ndays to live and you sell them one after another. Hey? Who can pay me\r\nenough for my life? Ay! But they throw at you your week\'s money and\r\nexpect you to say \'thank you\' before you pick it up."\r\n\r\nHe mumbled some curses, directed at employers generally, as it seemed,\r\nthen blazed out:\r\n\r\n"Work be damned! I ain\'t a dog walking on its hind legs for a bone; I am\r\na man who\'s following a gentleman. There\'s a difference which you will\r\nnever understand, Mr. Tame Schomberg."\r\n\r\nHe yawned slightly. Schomberg, preserving a military stiffness\r\nreinforced by a slight frown, had allowed his thoughts to stray away.\r\nThey were busy detailing the image of a young girl--absent--gone--stolen\r\nfrom him. He became enraged. There was that rascal looking at him\r\ninsolently. If the girl had not been shamefully decoyed away from him,\r\nhe would not have allowed anyone to look at him insolently. He would\r\nhave made nothing of hitting that rogue between the eyes. Afterwards he\r\nwould have kicked the other without hesitation. He saw himself doing it;\r\nand in sympathy with this glorious vision Schomberg\'s right foot, and\r\narm moved convulsively.\r\n\r\nAt this moment he came out of his sudden reverie to note with alarm the\r\nwide-awake curiosity of Mr. Ricardo\'s stare.\r\n\r\n"And so you go like this about the world, gambling," he remarked\r\ninanely, to cover his confusion. But Ricardo\'s stare did not change its\r\ncharacter, and he continued vaguely:\r\n\r\n"Here and there and everywhere." He pulled himself together, squared his\r\nshoulders. "Isn\'t it very precarious?" he said firmly.\r\n\r\nThe word precarious--seemed to be effective, because Ricardo\'s eyes lost\r\ntheir dangerously interested expression.\r\n\r\n"No, not so bad," Ricardo said, with indifference. "It\'s my opinion that\r\nmen will gamble as long as they have anything to put on a card. Gamble?\r\nThat\'s nature. What\'s life itself? You never know what may turn up. The\r\nworst of it is that you never can tell exactly what sort of cards you\r\nare holding yourself. What\'s trumps?--that is the question. See? Any man\r\nwill gamble if only he\'s given a chance, for anything or everything. You\r\ntoo--"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t touched a card now for twenty years," said Schomberg in an\r\naustere tone.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you got your living that way you would be no worse than you\r\nare now, selling drinks to people--beastly beer and spirits, rotten\r\nstuff fit to make an old he-goat yell if you poured it down its throat.\r\nPooh! I can\'t stand the confounded liquor. Never could. A whiff of neat\r\nbrandy in a glass makes me feel sick. Always did. If everybody was like\r\nme, liquor would be going a-begging. You think it\'s funny in a man,\r\ndon\'t you?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg made a vague gesture of toleration. Ricardo hitched up his\r\nchair and settled his elbow afresh on the table.\r\n\r\n"French siros I must say I do like. Saigon\'s the place for them. I see\r\nyou have siros in the bar. Hang me if I ain\'t getting dry, conversing\r\nlike this with you. Come, Mr. Schomberg, be hospitable, as the governor\r\nsays."\r\n\r\nSchomberg rose and walked with dignity to the counter. His footsteps\r\nechoed loudly on the floor of polished boards. He took down a bottle,\r\nlabelled "Sirop de Groseille." The little sounds he made, the clink of\r\nglass, the gurgling of the liquid, the pop of the soda-water cork had\r\na preternatural sharpness. He came back carrying a pink and glistening\r\ntumbler. Mr. Ricardo had followed his movements with oblique, coyly\r\nexpectant yellow eyes, like a cat watching the preparation of a saucer\r\nof milk, and the satisfied sound after he had drunk might have been a\r\nslightly modified form of purring, very soft and deep in his throat. It\r\naffected Schomberg unpleasantly as another example of something inhuman\r\nin those men wherein lay the difficulty of dealing with them. A\r\nspectre, a cat, an ape--there was a pretty association for a mere man to\r\nremonstrate with, he reflected with an inward shudder; for Schomberg had\r\nbeen overpowered, as it were, by his imagination, and his reason could\r\nnot react against that fanciful view of his guests. And it was not only\r\ntheir appearance. The morals of Mr. Ricardo seemed to him to be pretty\r\nmuch the morals of a cat. Too much. What sort of argument could a mere\r\nman offer to a . . . or to a spectre, either! What the morals of a\r\nspectre could be, Schomberg had no idea. Something dreadful, no\r\ndoubt. Compassion certainly had no place in them. As to the ape--well,\r\neverybody knew what an ape was. It had no morals. Nothing could be more\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, however, having picked up the cigar which he had laid aside\r\nto get the drink, with his thick fingers, one of them ornamented by a\r\ngold ring, Schomberg smoked with moody composure. Facing him, Ricardo\r\nblinked slowly for a time, then closed his eyes altogether, with the\r\nplacidity of the domestic cat dozing on the hearth-rug. In another\r\nmoment he opened them very wide, and seemed surprised to see Schomberg\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"You\'re having a very slack time today, aren\'t you?" he observed. "But\r\nthen this whole town is confoundedly slack, anyhow; and I\'ve never faced\r\nsuch a slack party at a table before. Come eleven o\'clock, they begin to\r\ntalk of breaking up. What\'s the matter with them? Want to go to bed so\r\nearly, or what?"\r\n\r\n"I reckon you don\'t lose a fortune by their wanting to go to bed," said\r\nSchomberg, with sombre sarcasm.\r\n\r\n"No," admitted Ricardo, with a grin that stretched his thin mouth from\r\near to ear, giving a sudden glimpse of his white teeth. "Only, you see,\r\nwhen I once start, I would play for nuts, for parched peas, for any\r\nrubbish. I would play them for their souls. But these Dutchmen aren\'t\r\nany good. They never seem to get warmed up properly, win or lose. I\'ve\r\ntried them both ways, too. Hang them for a beggarly, bloodless lot of\r\nanimated cucumbers!"\r\n\r\n"And if anything out of the way was to happen, they would be just\r\nas cool in locking you and your gentleman up," Schomberg snarled\r\nunpleasantly.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Ricardo slowly, taking Schomberg\'s measure with his eyes.\r\n"And what about you?"\r\n\r\n"You talk mighty big," burst out the hotel-keeper. "You talk of ranging\r\nall over the world, and doing great things, and taking fortune by the\r\nscruff of the neck, but here you stick at this miserable business!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t much of a lay--that\'s a fact," admitted Ricardo unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nSchomberg was red in the face with audacity.\r\n\r\n"I call it paltry," he spluttered.\r\n\r\n"That\'s how it looks. Can\'t call it anything else." Ricardo seemed to\r\nbe in an accommodating mood. "I should be ashamed of it myself, only you\r\nsee the governor is subject to fits--"\r\n\r\n"Fits!" Schomberg cried out, but in a low tone. "You don\'t say so!" He\r\nexulted inwardly, as if this disclosure had in some way diminished the\r\ndifficulty of the situation. "Fits! That\'s a serious thing, isn\'t it?\r\nYou ought to take him to the civil hospital--a lovely place."\r\n\r\nRicardo nodded slightly, with a faint grin.\r\n\r\n"Serious enough. Regular fits of laziness, I call them. Now and then\r\nhe lays down on me like this, and there\'s no moving him. If you think I\r\nlike it, you\'re a long way out. Generally speaking, I can talk him over.\r\nI know how to deal with a gentleman. I am no daily-bread slave. But when\r\nhe has said, \'Martin, I am bored,\' then look out! There\'s nothing to do\r\nbut to shut up, confound it!"\r\n\r\nSchomberg, very much cast down, had listened open-mouthed.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the cause of it?" he asked. "Why is he like this? I don\'t\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"I think I do," said Ricardo. "A gentleman, you know, is not such a\r\nsimple person as you or I; and not so easy to manage, either. If only I\r\nhad something to lever him out with!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, to lever him out with?" muttered Schomberg\r\nhopelessly.\r\n\r\nRicardo was impatient with this denseness.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you understand English? Look here! I couldn\'t make this\r\nbilliard table move an inch if I talked to it from now till the end of\r\ndays--could I? Well, the governor is like that, too, when the fits are\r\non him. He\'s bored. Nothing\'s worthwhile, nothing\'s good enough, that\'s\r\nmere sense. But if I saw a capstan bar lying about here, I would soon\r\nmanage to shift that billiard table of yours a good many inches. And\r\nthat\'s all there is to it."\r\n\r\nHe rose noiselessly, stretched himself, supple and stealthy, with\r\ncurious sideways movements of his head and unexpected elongations of his\r\nthick body, glanced out of the corners of his eyes in the direction of\r\nthe door, and finally leaned back against the table, folding his arms on\r\nhis breast comfortably, in a completely human attitude.\r\n\r\n"That\'s another thing you can tell a gentleman by--his freakishness.\r\nA gentleman ain\'t accountable to nobody, any more than a tramp on the\r\nroads. He ain\'t got to keep time. The governor got like this once in a\r\none-horse Mexican pueblo on the uplands, away from everywhere. He lay\r\nall day long in a dark room--"\r\n\r\n"Drunk?" This word escaped Schomberg by inadvertence at which he became\r\nfrightened. But the devoted secretary seemed to find it natural.\r\n\r\n"No, that never comes on together with this kind of fit. He just lay\r\nthere full length on a mat, while a ragged, bare-legged boy that he had\r\npicked up in the street sat in the patio, between two oleanders near the\r\nopen door of his room, strumming on a guitar and singing tristes to him\r\nfrom morning to night. You know tristes--twang, twang, twang, aouh, hoo!\r\nChroo, yah!"\r\n\r\nSchomberg uplifted his hands in distress. This tribute seemed to flatter\r\nRicardo. His mouth twitched grimly.\r\n\r\n"Like that--enough to give colic to an ostrich, eh? Awful. Well, there\r\nwas a cook there who loved me--an old fat, Negro woman with spectacles.\r\nI used to hide in the kitchen and turn her to, to make me dulces--sweet\r\nthings, you know, mostly eggs and sugar--to pass the time away. I am\r\nlike a kid for sweet things. And, by the way, why don\'t you ever have\r\na pudding at your tablydott, Mr. Schomberg? Nothing but fruit, morning,\r\nnoon, and night. Sickening! What do you think a fellow is--a wasp?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg disregarded the injured tone.\r\n\r\n"And how long did that fit, as you call it, last?" he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Weeks, months, years, centuries, it seemed to me," returned Mr. Ricardo\r\nwith feeling. "Of an evening the governor would stroll out into the sala\r\nand fritter his life away playing cards with the juez of the place--a\r\nlittle Dago with a pair of black whiskers--ekarty, you know, a\r\nquick French game, for small change. And the comandante, a one-eyed,\r\nhalf-Indian, flat-nosed ruffian, and I, we had to stand around and bet\r\non their hands. It was awful!"\r\n\r\n"Awful," echoed Schomberg, in a Teutonic throaty tone of despair. "Look\r\nhere, I need your rooms."\r\n\r\n"To be sure. I have been thinking that for some time past," said Ricardo\r\nindifferently.\r\n\r\n"I was mad when I listened to you. This must end!"\r\n\r\n"I think you are mad yet," said Ricardo, not even unfolding his arms or\r\nshifting his attitude an inch. He lowered his voice to add: "And if\r\nI thought you had been to the police, I would tell Pedro to catch\r\nyou round the waist and break your fat neck by jerking your head\r\nbackward--snap! I saw him do it to a big buck nigger who was flourishing\r\na razor in front of the governor. It can be done. You hear a low crack,\r\nthat\'s all--and the man drops down like a limp rag."\r\n\r\nNot even Ricardo\'s head, slightly inclined on the left shoulder, had\r\nmoved; but when he ceased the greenish irises which had been staring out\r\nof doors glided into the corners of his eyes nearest to Schomberg and\r\nstayed there with a coyly voluptuous expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\nSchomberg felt desperation, that lamentable substitute for courage,\r\nooze out of him. It was not so much the threat of death as the weirdly\r\ncircumstantial manner of its declaration which affected him. A mere\r\n"I\'ll murder you," however ferocious in tone, and earnest, in purpose,\r\nhe could have faced; but before this novel mode of speech and procedure,\r\nhis imagination being very sensitive to the unusual, he collapsed as if\r\nindeed his moral neck had been broken--snap!\r\n\r\n"Go to the police? Of course not. Never dreamed of it. Too late now.\r\nI\'ve let myself be mixed up in this. You got my consent while I wasn\'t\r\nmyself. I explained it to you at the time."\r\n\r\nRicardo\'s eye glided gently off Schomberg to stare far away.\r\n\r\n"Ay! Some trouble with a girl. But that\'s nothing to us."\r\n\r\n"Naturally. What I say is, what\'s the good of all that savage talk to\r\nme?" A bright argument occurred to him. "It\'s out of proportion; for\r\neven if I were fool enough to go to the police now, there\'s nothing\r\nserious to complain about. It would only mean deportation for you. They\r\nwould put you on board the first west-bound steamer to Singapore." He\r\nhad become animated. "Out of this to the devil," he added between his\r\nteeth for his own private satisfaction.\r\n\r\nRicardo made no comment, and gave no sign of having heard a single word.\r\nThis discouraged Schomberg, who had looked up hopefully.\r\n\r\n"Why do you want to stick here?" he cried. "It can\'t pay you people\r\nto fool around like this. Didn\'t you worry just now about moving your\r\ngovernor? Well, the police would move him for you; and from Singapore\r\nyou can go on to the east coast of Africa."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be hanged if the fellow isn\'t up to that silly trick!" was\r\nRicardo\'s comment, spoken in an ominous tone which recalled Schomberg to\r\nthe realities of his position.\r\n\r\n"No! No!" he protested. "It\'s a manner of speaking. Of course I\r\nwouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I think that trouble about the girl has really muddled your brains,\r\nMr. Schomberg. Believe me, you had better part friends with us; for,\r\ndeportation or no deportation, you\'ll be seeing one of us turning up\r\nbefore long to pay you off for any nasty dodge you may be hatching in\r\nthat fat head of yours."\r\n\r\n"Gott im Himmel!" groaned Schomberg. "Will nothing move him out? Will\r\nhe stop here immer--I mean always? Suppose I were to make it worth your\r\nwhile, couldn\'t you--"\r\n\r\n"No," Ricardo interrupted. "I couldn\'t, unless I had something to lever\r\nhim out with. I\'ve told you that before."\r\n\r\n"An inducement?" muttered Schomberg.\r\n\r\n"Ay. The east coast of Africa isn\'t good enough. He told me the other\r\nday that it will have to wait till he is ready for it; and he may not be\r\nready for a long time, because the east coast can\'t run away, and no one\r\nis likely to run off with it."\r\n\r\nThese remarks, whether considered as truisms or as depicting Mr.\r\nJones\'s mental state, were distinctly discouraging to the long-suffering\r\nSchomberg; but there is truth in the well-known saying that places\r\nthe darkest hour before the dawn. The sound of words, apart from the\r\ncontext, has its power; and these two words, \'run off,\' had a special\r\naffinity to the hotel-keeper\'s, haunting idea. It was always present\r\nin his brain, and now it came forward evoked by a purely fortuitous\r\nexpression. No, nobody could run off with a continent; but Heyst had run\r\noff with the girl!\r\n\r\nRicardo could have had no conception of the cause of Schomberg\'s changed\r\nexpression. Yet it was noticeable enough to interest him so much that\r\nhe stopped the careless swinging of his leg and said, looking at the\r\nhotel-keeper:\r\n\r\n"There\'s not much use arguing against that sort of talk--is there?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg was not listening.\r\n\r\n"I could put you on another track," he said slowly, and stopped, as if\r\nsuddenly choked by an unholy emotion of intense eagerness combined with\r\nfear of failure. Ricardo waited, attentive, yet not without a certain\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n"On the track of a man!" Schomberg uttered convulsively, and paused\r\nagain, consulting his rage and his conscience.\r\n\r\n"The man in the moon, eh?" suggested Ricardo, in a jeering murmur.\r\n\r\nSchomberg shook his head.\r\n\r\n"It would be nearly as safe to rook him as if he were the Man in the\r\nmoon. You go and try. It isn\'t so very far."\r\n\r\nHe reflected. These men were thieves and murderers as well as gamblers.\r\nTheir fitness for purposes of vengeance was appallingly complete. But he\r\npreferred not to think of it in detail. He put it to himself summarily\r\nthat he would be paying Heyst out and would, at the same time, relieve\r\nhimself of these men\'s oppression. He had only to let loose his natural\r\ngift for talking scandalously about his fellow creatures. And in this\r\ncase his great practice in it was assisted by hate, which, like love,\r\nhas an eloquence of its own. With the utmost ease he portrayed for\r\nRicardo, now seriously attentive, a Heyst fattened by years of private\r\nand public rapines, the murderer of Morrison, the swindler of many\r\nshareholders, a wonderful mixture of craft and impudence, of deep\r\npurposes and simple wiles, of mystery and futility. In this exercise of\r\nhis natural function Schomberg revived, the colour coming back to his\r\nface, loquacious, florid, eager, his manliness set off by the military\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the exact story. He was seen hanging about this part of the\r\nworld for years, spying into everybody\'s business: but I am the only\r\none who has seen through him from the first--contemptible, double-faced,\r\nstick-at-nothing, dangerous fellow."\r\n\r\n"Dangerous, is he?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg came to himself at the sound of Ricardo\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Well, you know what I mean," he said uneasily. "A lying, circumventing,\r\nsoft-spoken, polite, stuck-up rascal. Nothing open about him."\r\n\r\nMr Ricardo had slipped off the table, and was prowling about the room in\r\nan oblique, noiseless manner. He flashed a grin at Schomberg in passing,\r\nand a snarling:\r\n\r\n"Ah! H\'m!"\r\n\r\n"Well, what more dangerous do you want?" argued Schomberg. "He\'s in no\r\nway a fighting man, I believe," he added negligently.\r\n\r\n"And you say he has been living alone there?"\r\n\r\n"Like the man in the moon," answered Schomberg readily. "There\'s no\r\none that cares a rap what becomes of him. He has been lying low, you\r\nunderstand, after bagging all that plunder."\r\n\r\n"Plunder, eh? Why didn\'t he go home with it?" inquired Ricardo.\r\n\r\nThe henchman of plain Mr. Jones was beginning to think that this was\r\nsomething worth looking into. And he was pursuing truth in the manner\r\nof men of sounder morality and purer intentions than his own; that is he\r\npursued it in the light of his own experience and prejudices. For facts,\r\nwhatever their origin (and God only knows where they come from), can be\r\nonly tested by our own particular suspicions. Ricardo was suspicious all\r\nround. Schomberg, such is the tonic of recovered self-esteem, Schomberg\r\nretorted fearlessly:\r\n\r\n"Go home? Why don\'t you go home? To hear your talk, you must have made\r\na pretty considerable pile going round winning people\'s money. You ought\r\nto be ready by this time."\r\n\r\nRicardo stopped to look at Schomberg with surprise.\r\n\r\n"You think yourself very clever, don\'t you?" he said.\r\n\r\nSchomberg just then was so conscious of being clever that the snarling\r\nirony left him unmoved. There was positively a smile in his noble\r\nTeutonic beard, the first smile for weeks. He was in a felicitous vein.\r\n\r\n"How do you know that he wasn\'t thinking of going home? As a matter of\r\nfact, he was on his way home."\r\n\r\n"And how do I know that you are not amusing yourself by spinning out\r\na blamed fairy tale?" interrupted Ricardo roughly. "I wonder at myself\r\nlistening to the silly rot!"\r\n\r\nSchomberg received this turn of temper unmoved. He did not require to be\r\nvery subtly observant to notice that he had managed to arouse some sort\r\nof feeling, perhaps of greed, in Ricardo\'s breast.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t believe me? Well! You can ask anybody that comes here if\r\nthat--that Swede hadn\'t got as far as this house on his way home. Why\r\nshould he turn up here if not for that? You ask anybody."\r\n\r\n"Ask, indeed!" returned the other. "Catch me asking at large about a man\r\nI mean to drop on! Such jobs must be done on the quiet--or not at all."\r\n\r\nThe peculiar intonation of the last phrase touched the nape of\r\nSchomberg\'s neck with a chill. He cleared his throat slightly and looked\r\naway as though he had heard something indelicate. Then, with a jump as\r\nit were:\r\n\r\n"Of course he didn\'t tell me. Is it likely? But haven\'t I got eyes?\r\nHaven\'t I got my common sense to tell me? I can see through people. By\r\nthe same token, he called on the Tesmans. Why did he call on the Tesmans\r\ntwo days running, eh? You don\'t know? You can\'t tell?"\r\n\r\nHe waited complacently till Ricardo had finished swearing quite openly\r\nat him for a confounded chatterer, and then went on:\r\n\r\n"A fellow doesn\'t go to a counting-house in business hours for a chat\r\nabout the weather, two days running. Then why? To close his account with\r\nthem one day, and to get his money out the next! Clear, what?"\r\n\r\nRicardo, with his trick of looking one way and moving another approached\r\nSchomberg slowly.\r\n\r\n"To get his money?" he purred.\r\n\r\n"Gewiss," snapped Schomberg with impatient superiority. "What else? That\r\nis, only the money he had with the Tesmans. What he has buried or put\r\naway on the island, devil only knows. When you think of the lot of hard\r\ncash that passed through that man\'s hands, for wages and stores and all\r\nthat--and he\'s just a cunning thief, I tell you." Ricardo\'s hard stare\r\ndiscomposed the hotel-keeper, and he added in an embarrassed tone: "I\r\nmean a common, sneaking thief--no account at all. And he calls himself a\r\nSwedish baron, too! Tfui!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a baron, is he? That foreign nobility ain\'t much," commented Mr.\r\nRicardo seriously. "And then what? He hung about here!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he hung about," said Schomberg, making a wry mouth. "He--hung\r\nabout. That\'s it. Hung--"\r\n\r\nHis voice died out. Curiosity was depicted in Ricardo\'s countenance.\r\n\r\n"Just like that; for nothing? And then turned about and went back to\r\nthat island again?"\r\n\r\n"And went back to that island again," Schomberg echoed lifelessly,\r\nfixing his gaze on the floor.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with you?" asked Ricardo with genuine surprise. "What\r\nis it?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg, without looking up, made an impatient gesture. His face was\r\ncrimson, and he kept it lowered. Ricardo went back to the point.\r\n\r\n"Well, but how do you account for it? What was his reason? What did he\r\ngo back to the island for?"\r\n\r\n"Honeymoon!" spat out Schomberg viciously.\r\n\r\nPerfectly still, his eyes downcast, he suddenly, with no preliminary\r\nstir, hit the table with his fist a blow which caused the utterly\r\nunprepared Ricardo to leap aside. And only then did Schomberg look up\r\nwith a dull, resentful expression.\r\n\r\nRicardo stared hard for a moment, spun on his heel, walked to the end\r\nof the room, came back smartly, and muttered a profound "Ay! Ay!" above\r\nSchomberg\'s rigid head. That the hotel-keeper was capable of a\r\ngreat moral effort was proved by a gradual return of his severe,\r\nLieutenant-of-the-Reserve manner.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay!" repeated Ricardo more deliberately than before, and as if\r\nafter a further survey of the circumstances, "I wish I hadn\'t asked you,\r\nor that you had told me a lie. It don\'t suit me to know that there\'s a\r\nwoman mixed up in this affair. What\'s she like? It\'s the girl you--"\r\n\r\n"Leave off!" muttered Schomberg, utterly pitiful behind his stiff\r\nmilitary front.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay!" Ricardo ejaculated for the third time, more and more\r\nenlightened and perplexed. "Can\'t bear to talk about it--so bad as that?\r\nAnd yet I would bet she isn\'t a miracle to look at."\r\n\r\nSchomberg made a gesture as if he didn\'t know, as if he didn\'t care.\r\nThen he squared his shoulders and frowned at vacancy.\r\n\r\n"Swedish baron--h\'m!" Ricardo continued meditatively. "I believe the\r\ngovernor would think that business worth looking up, quite, if I put it\r\nto him properly. The governor likes a duel, if you will call it so; but\r\nI don\'t know a man that can stand up to him on the square. Have you ever\r\nseen a cat play with a mouse? It\'s a pretty sight!"\r\n\r\nRicardo, with his voluptuously gleaming eyes and the coy expression,\r\nlooked so much like a cat that Schomberg would have felt all the alarm\r\nof a mouse if other feelings had not had complete possession of his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n"There are no lies between you and me," he said, more steadily than he\r\nthought he could speak.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the good now? He funks women. In that Mexican pueblo where we\r\nlay grounded on our beef-bones, so to speak, I used to go to dances of\r\nan evening. The girls there would ask me if the English caballero in\r\nthe posada was a monk in disguise, or if he had taken a vow to the\r\nsancissima madre not to speak to a woman, or whether--You can imagine\r\nwhat fairly free-spoken girls will ask when they come to the point of\r\nnot caring what they say; and it used to vex me. Yes, the governor funks\r\nfacing women."\r\n\r\n"One woman?" interjected Schomberg in guttural tones.\r\n\r\n"One may be more awkward to deal with than two, or two hundred, for that\r\nmatter. In a place that\'s full of women you needn\'t look at them unless\r\nyou like; but if you go into a room where there is only one woman, young\r\nor old, pretty or ugly, you have got to face her. And, unless you are\r\nafter her, then--the governor is right enough--she\'s in the way."\r\n\r\n"Why notice them?" muttered Schomberg. "What can they do?"\r\n\r\n"Make a noise, if nothing else," opined Mr. Ricardo curtly, with the\r\ndistaste of a man whose path is a path of silence; for indeed, nothing\r\nis more odious than a noise when one is engaged in a weighty and\r\nabsorbing card game. "Noise, noise, my friend," he went on forcibly;\r\n"confounded screeching about something or other, and I like it no more\r\nthan the governor does. But with the governor there\'s something else\r\nbesides. He can\'t stand them at all."\r\n\r\nHe paused to reflect on this psychological phenomenon, and as no\r\nphilosopher was at hand to tell him that there is no strong sentiment\r\nwithout some terror, as there is no real religion without a little\r\nfetishism, he emitted his own conclusion, which surely could not go to\r\nthe root of the matter.\r\n\r\n"I\'m hanged if I don\'t think they are to him what liquor is to me.\r\nBrandy--pah!"\r\n\r\nHe made a disgusted face, and produced a genuine shudder. Schomberg\r\nlistened to him in wonder. It looked as if the very scoundrelism, of\r\nthat--that Swede would protect him; the spoil of his iniquity standing\r\nbetween the thief and the retribution.\r\n\r\n"That\'s so, old buck." Ricardo broke the silence after contemplating\r\nSchomberg\'s mute dejection with a sort of sympathy. "I don\'t think this\r\ntrick will work."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s silly," whispered the man deprived of the vengeance which he\r\nhad seemed already to hold in his hand, by a mysterious and exasperating\r\nidiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you set yourself to judge a gentleman." Ricardo without anger\r\nadministered a moody rebuke. "Even I can\'t understand the governor\r\nthoroughly. And I am an Englishman and his follower. No, I don\'t think I\r\ncare to put it before him, sick as I am of staying here."\r\n\r\nRicardo could not be more sick of staying than Schomberg was of seeing\r\nhim stay. Schomberg believed so firmly in the reality of Heyst as\r\ncreated by his own power of false inferences, of his hate, of his love\r\nof scandal, that he could not contain a stifled cry of conviction\r\nas sincere as most of our convictions, the disguised servants of our\r\npassions, can appear at a supreme moment.\r\n\r\n"It would have been like going to pick up a nugget of a thousand pounds,\r\nor two or three times as much, for all I know. No trouble, no--"\r\n\r\n"The petticoat\'s the trouble," Ricardo struck in.\r\n\r\nHe had resumed his noiseless, feline, oblique prowling, in which an\r\nobserver would have detected a new character of excitement, such as a\r\nwild animal of the cat species, anxious to make a spring, might betray.\r\nSchomberg saw nothing. It would probably have cheered his drooping\r\nspirits; but in a general way he preferred not to look at Ricardo.\r\nRicardo, however, with one of his slanting, gliding, restless glances,\r\nobserved the bitter smile on Schomberg\'s bearded lips--the unmistakable\r\nsmile of ruined hopes.\r\n\r\n"You are a pretty unforgiving sort of chap," he said, stopping for a\r\nmoment with an air of interest. "Hang me if I ever saw anybody look so\r\ndisappointed! I bet you would send black plague to that island if you\r\nonly knew how--eh, what? Plague too good for them? Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nHe bent down to stare at Schomberg who sat unstirring with stony eyes\r\nand set features, and apparently deaf to the rasping derision of that\r\nlaughter so close to his red fleshy ear.\r\n\r\n"Black plague too good for them, ha, ha!" Ricardo pressed the point on\r\nthe tormented hotel-keeper. Schomberg kept his eyes down obstinately.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wish any harm to the girl--" he muttered.\r\n\r\n"But did she bolt from you? A fair bilk? Come!"\r\n\r\n"Devil only knows what that villainous Swede had done to her--what he\r\npromised her, how he frightened her. She couldn\'t have cared for him,\r\nI know." Schomberg\'s vanity clung to the belief in some atrocious,\r\nextraordinary means of seduction employed by Heyst. "Look how he\r\nbewitched that poor Morrison," he murmured.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Morrison--got all his money, what?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--and his life."\r\n\r\n"Terrible fellow, that Swedish baron! How is one to get at him?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg exploded.\r\n\r\n"Three against one! Are you shy? Do you want me to give you a letter of\r\nintroduction?"\r\n\r\n"You ought to look at yourself in a glass," Ricardo said quietly. "Dash\r\nme if you don\'t get a stroke of some kind presently. And this is the\r\nfellow who says women can do nothing! That one will do for you, unless\r\nyou manage to forget her."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could," Schomberg admitted earnestly. "And it\'s all the doing\r\nof that Swede. I don\'t get enough sleep, Mr. Ricardo. And then, to\r\nfinish me off, you gentlemen turn up . . . as if I hadn\'t enough worry."\r\n\r\n"That\'s done you good," suggested the secretary with ironic seriousness.\r\n"Takes your mind off that silly trouble. At your age too."\r\n\r\nHe checked himself, as if in pity, and changing his tone:\r\n\r\n"I would really like to oblige you while doing a stroke of business at\r\nthe same time."\r\n\r\n"A good stroke," insisted Schomberg, as if it were mechanically. In his\r\nsimplicity he was not able to give up the idea which had entered his\r\nhead. An idea must be driven out by another idea, and with Schomberg\r\nideas were rare and therefore tenacious. "Minted gold," he murmured with\r\na sort of anguish.\r\n\r\nSuch an expressive combination of words was not without effect upon\r\nRicardo. Both these men were amenable to the influence of verbal\r\nsuggestions. The secretary of "plain Mr. Jones" sighed and murmured.\r\n\r\n"Yes. But how is one to get at it?"\r\n\r\n"Being three to one," said Schomberg, "I suppose you could get it for\r\nthe asking."\r\n\r\n"One would think the fellow lived next door," Ricardo growled\r\nimpatiently. "Hang it all, can\'t you understand a plain question? I have\r\nasked you the way."\r\n\r\nSchomberg seemed to revive.\r\n\r\n"The way?"\r\n\r\nThe torpor of deceived hopes underlying his superficial changes of mood\r\nhad been pricked by these words which seemed pointed with purpose.\r\n\r\n"The way is over the water, of course," said the hotel-keeper. "For\r\npeople like you, three days in a good, big boat is nothing. It\'s no more\r\nthan a little outing, a bit of a change. At this season the Java Sea\r\nis a pond. I have an excellent, safe boat--a ship\'s life-boat--carry\r\nthirty, let alone three, and a child could handle her. You wouldn\'t get\r\na wet face at this time of the year. You might call it a pleasure-trip."\r\n\r\n"And yet, having this boat, you didn\'t go after her yourself--or after\r\nhim? Well, you are a fine fellow for a disappointed lover."\r\n\r\nSchomberg gave a start at the suggestion.\r\n\r\n"I am not three men," he said sulkily, as the shortest answer of the\r\nseveral he could have given.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know your sort," Ricardo let fall negligently. "You are like most\r\npeople--or perhaps just a little more peaceable than the rest of the\r\nbuying and selling gang that bosses this rotten show. Well, well,\r\nyou respectable citizen," he went on, "let us go thoroughly into the\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\nWhen Schomberg had been made to understand that Mr. Jones\'s henchman was\r\nready to discuss, in his own words, "this boat of yours, with courses\r\nand distances," and such concrete matters of no good augury to that\r\nvillainous Swede, he recovered his soldierly bearing, squared his\r\nshoulders, and asked in his military manner:\r\n\r\n"You wish, then, to proceed with the business?"\r\n\r\nRicardo nodded. He had a great mind to, he said. A gentleman had to be\r\nhumoured as much as possible; but he must be managed, too, on occasions,\r\nfor his own good. And it was the business of the right sort of\r\n"follower" to know the proper time and the proper methods of that\r\ndelicate part of his duty. Having exposed this theory Ricardo proceeded\r\nto the application.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never actually lied to him," he said, "and I ain\'t going to now.\r\nI shall just say nothing about the girl. He will have to get over the\r\nshock the best he can. Hang it all! Too much humouring won\'t do here."\r\n\r\n"Funny thing," Schomberg observed crisply.\r\n\r\n"Is it? Ay, you wouldn\'t mind taking a woman by the throat in some dark\r\ncorner and nobody by, I bet!"\r\n\r\nRicardo\'s dreadful, vicious, cat-like readiness to get his claws out at\r\nany moment startled Schomberg as usual. But it was provoking too.\r\n\r\n"And you?" he defended himself. "Don\'t you want me to believe you are up\r\nto anything?"\r\n\r\n"I, my boy? Oh, yes. I am not that gentleman; neither are you. Take \'em\r\nby the throat or chuck \'em under the chin is all one to me--almost,"\r\naffirmed Ricardo, with something obscurely ironical in his complacency.\r\n"Now, as to this business. A three days\' jaunt in a good boat isn\'t a\r\nthing to frighten people like us. You are right, so far; but there are\r\nother details."\r\n\r\nSchomberg was ready enough to enter into details. He explained that he\r\nhad a small plantation, with a fairly habitable hut on it, on Madura. He\r\nproposed that his guest should start from town in his boat, as if going\r\nfor an excursion to that rural spot. The custom-house people on the quay\r\nwere used to see his boat go off on such trips.\r\n\r\nFrom Madura, after some repose and on a convenient day, Mr. Jones\r\nand party would make the real start. It would all be plain sailing.\r\nSchomberg undertook to provision the boat. The greatest hardship the\r\nvoyagers need apprehend would be a mild shower of rain. At that season\r\nof the year there were no serious thunderstorms.\r\n\r\nSchomberg\'s heart began to thump as he saw himself nearing his\r\nvengeance. His speech was thick but persuasive.\r\n\r\n"No risk at all--none whatever."\r\n\r\nRicardo dismissed these assurances of safety with an impatient gesture.\r\nHe was thinking of other risks.\r\n\r\n"The getting away from here is all right; but we may be sighted at sea,\r\nand that may bring awkwardness later on. A ship\'s boat with three white\r\nmen in her, knocking about out of sight of land, is bound to make talk.\r\nAre we likely to be seen on our way?"\r\n\r\n"No, unless by native craft," said Schomberg.\r\n\r\nRicardo nodded, satisfied. Both these white men looked on native life as\r\na mere play of shadows. A play of shadows the dominant race could\r\nwalk through unaffected and disregarded in the pursuit of its\r\nincomprehensible aims and needs. No. Native craft did not count, of\r\ncourse. It was an empty, solitary part of the sea, Schomberg expounded\r\nfurther. Only the Ternate mail-boat crossed that region about the eighth\r\nof every month, regularly--nowhere near the island though. Rigid, his\r\nvoice hoarse, his heart thumping, his mind concentrated on the success\r\nof his plan, the hotel-keeper multiplied words, as if to keep as many\r\nof them as possible between himself and the murderous aspect of his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n"So, if you gentlemen depart from my plantation quietly at sunset on the\r\neighth--always best to make a start at night, with a land breeze--it\'s a\r\nhundred to one--What am I saying?--it\'s a thousand to one that no\r\nhuman eye will see you on the passage. All you\'ve got to do is keep her\r\nheading north-east for, say, fifty hours; perhaps not quite so long.\r\nThere will always be draft enough to keep a boat moving; you may reckon\r\non that; and then--"\r\n\r\nThe muscles about his waist quivered under his clothes with eagerness,\r\nwith impatience, and with something like apprehension, the true nature\r\nof which was not clear to him. And he did not want to investigate it.\r\nRicardo regarded him steadily, with those dry eyes of his shining more\r\nlike polished stones than living tissue.\r\n\r\n"And then what?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"And then--why, you will astonish der herr baron--ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nSchomberg seemed to force the words and the laugh out of himself in a\r\nhoarse bass.\r\n\r\n"And you believe he has all that plunder by him?" asked Ricardo, rather\r\nperfunctorily, because the fact seemed to him extremely probable when\r\nlooked at all round by his acute mind.\r\n\r\nSchomberg raised his hands and lowered them slowly.\r\n\r\n"How can it be otherwise? He was going home, he was on his way, in this\r\nhotel. Ask people. Was it likely he would leave it behind him?"\r\n\r\nRicardo was thoughtful. Then, suddenly raising his head, he remarked:\r\n\r\n"Steer north-east for fifty hours, eh? That\'s not much of a sailing\r\ndirection. I\'ve heard of a port being missed before on better\r\ninformation. Can\'t you say what sort of landfall a fellow may expect?\r\nBut I suppose you have never seen that island yourself?"\r\n\r\nSchomberg admitted that he had not seen it, in a tone in which a\r\nman congratulates himself on having escaped the contamination of an\r\nunsavoury experience. No, certainly not. He had never had any business\r\nto call there. But what of that? He could give Mr. Ricardo as good a\r\nsea-mark as anybody need wish for. He laughed nervously. Miss it! He\r\ndefied anyone that came within forty miles of it to miss the retreat of\r\nthat villainous Swede.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of a pillar of smoke by day and a loom of fire at\r\nnight? There\'s a volcano in full blast near that island--enough to guide\r\nalmost a blind man. What more do you want? An active volcano to steer\r\nby?"\r\n\r\nThese last words he roared out exultingly, then jumped up and glared.\r\nThe door to the left of the bar had swung open, and Mrs. Schomberg,\r\ndressed for duty, stood facing him down the whole length of the room.\r\nShe clung to the handle for a moment, then came in and glided to her\r\nplace, where she sat down to stare straight before her, as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\nTropical nature had been kind to the failure of the commercial\r\nenterprise. The desolation of the headquarters of the Tropical Belt Coal\r\nCompany had been screened from the side of the sea; from the side where\r\nprying eyes--if any were sufficiently interested, either in malice or\r\nin sorrow--could have noted the decaying bones of that once sanguine\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nHeyst had been sitting among the bones buried so kindly in the grass of\r\ntwo wet seasons\' growth. The silence of his surroundings, broken only by\r\nsuch sounds as a distant roll of thunder, the lash of rain through the\r\nfoliage of some big trees, the noise of the wind tossing the leaves of\r\nthe forest, and of the short seas breaking against the shore, favoured\r\nrather than hindered his solitary meditation.\r\n\r\nA meditation is always--in a white man, at least--more or less an\r\ninterrogative exercise. Heyst meditated in simple terms on the mystery\r\nof his actions; and he answered himself with the honest reflection:\r\n\r\n"There must be a lot of the original Adam in me, after all."\r\n\r\nHe reflected, too, with the sense of making a discovery, that this\r\nprimeval ancestor is not easily suppressed. The oldest voice in the\r\nworld is just the one that never ceases to speak. If anybody could have\r\nsilenced its imperative echoes, it should have been Heyst\'s father, with\r\nhis contemptuous, inflexible negation of all effort; but apparently he\r\ncould not. There was in the son a lot of that first ancestor who,\r\nas soon as he could uplift his muddy frame from the celestial mould,\r\nstarted inspecting and naming the animals of that paradise which he was\r\nso soon to lose.\r\n\r\nAction--the first thought, or perhaps the first impulse, on earth! The\r\nbarbed hook, baited with the illusions of progress, to bring out of the\r\nlightless void the shoals of unnumbered generations!\r\n\r\n"And I, the son of my father, have been caught too, like the silliest\r\nfish of them all." Heyst said to himself.\r\n\r\nHe suffered. He was hurt by the sight of his own life, which ought to\r\nhave been a masterpiece of aloofness. He remembered always his last\r\nevening with his father. He remembered the thin features, the great mass\r\nof white hair, and the ivory complexion. A five-branched candlestick\r\nstood on a little table by the side of the easy chair. They had been\r\ntalking a long time. The noises of the street had died out one by one,\r\ntill at last, in the moonlight, the London houses began to look like the\r\ntombs of an unvisited, unhonoured, cemetery of hopes.\r\n\r\nHe had listened. Then, after a silence, he had asked--for he was really\r\nyoung then:\r\n\r\n"Is there no guidance?"\r\n\r\nHis father was in an unexpectedly soft mood on that night, when the moon\r\nswam in a cloudless sky over the begrimed shadows of the town.\r\n\r\n"You still believe in something, then?" he said in a clear voice,\r\nwhich had been growing feeble of late. "You believe in flesh and blood,\r\nperhaps? A full and equable contempt would soon do away with that, too.\r\nBut since you have not attained to it, I advise you to cultivate\r\nthat form of contempt which is called pity. It is perhaps the least\r\ndifficult--always remembering that you, too, if you are anything, are as\r\npitiful as the rest, yet never expecting any pity for yourself."\r\n\r\n"What is one to do, then?" sighed the young man, regarding his father,\r\nrigid in the high-backed chair.\r\n\r\n"Look on--make no sound," were the last words of the man who had spent\r\nhis life in blowing blasts upon a terrible trumpet which filled heaven\r\nand earth with ruins, while mankind went on its way unheeding.\r\n\r\nThat very night he died in his bed, so quietly that they found him\r\nin his usual attitude of sleep, lying on his side, one hand under his\r\ncheek, and his knees slightly bent. He had not even straightened his\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nHis son buried the silenced destroyer of systems, of hopes, of beliefs.\r\nHe observed that the death of that bitter contemner of life did not\r\ntrouble the flow of life\'s stream, where men and women go by thick as\r\ndust, revolving and jostling one another like figures cut out of cork\r\nand weighted with lead just sufficiently to keep them in their proudly\r\nupright posture.\r\n\r\nAfter the funeral, Heyst sat alone, in the dusk, and his meditation took\r\nthe form of a definite vision of the stream, of the fatuously jostling,\r\nnodding, spinning figures hurried irresistibly along, and giving no sign\r\nof being aware that the voice on the bank had been suddenly silenced .\r\n. . Yes. A few obituary notices generally insignificant and some grossly\r\nabusive. The son had read them all with mournful detachment.\r\n\r\n"This is the hate and rage of their fear," he thought to himself, "and\r\nalso of wounded vanity. They shriek their little shriek as they fly\r\npast. I suppose I ought to hate him too . . ."\r\n\r\nHe became aware of his eyes being wet. It was not that the man was his\r\nfather. For him it was purely a matter of hearsay which could not in\r\nitself cause this emotion. No! It was because he had looked at him so\r\nlong that he missed him so much. The dead man had kept him on the bank\r\nby his side. And now Heyst felt acutely that he was alone on the bank of\r\nthe stream. In his pride he determined not to enter it.\r\n\r\nA few slow tears rolled down his face. The rooms, filling with shadows,\r\nseemed haunted by a melancholy, uneasy presence which could not express\r\nitself. The young man got up with a strange sense of making way for\r\nsomething impalpable that claimed possession, went out of the house, and\r\nlocked the door. A fortnight later he started on his travels--to "look\r\non and never make a sound."\r\n\r\nThe elder Heyst had left behind him a little money and a certain\r\nquantity of movable objects, such as books, tables, chairs, and\r\npictures, which might have complained of heartless desertion after many\r\nyears of faithful service; for there is a soul in things. Heyst, our\r\nHeyst, had often thought of them, reproachful and mute, shrouded and\r\nlocked up in those rooms, far away in London with the sounds of the\r\nstreet reaching them faintly, and sometimes a little sunshine, when\r\nthe blinds were pulled up and the windows opened from time to time in\r\npursuance of his original instructions and later reminders. It seemed\r\nas if in his conception of a world not worth touching, and perhaps not\r\nsubstantial enough to grasp, these objects familiar to his childhood and\r\nhis youth, and associated with the memory of an old man, were the only\r\nrealities, something having an absolute existence. He would never have\r\nthem sold, or even moved from the places they occupied when he looked\r\nupon them last. When he was advised from London that his lease had\r\nexpired, and that the house, with some others as like it as two peas,\r\nwas to be demolished, he was surprisingly distressed.\r\n\r\nHe had entered by then the broad, human path of inconsistencies. Already\r\nthe Tropical Belt Coal Company was in existence. He sent instructions\r\nto have some of the things sent out to him at Samburan, just as any\r\nordinary, credulous person would have done. They came, torn out from\r\ntheir long repose--a lot of books, some chairs and tables, his father\'s\r\nportrait in oils, which surprised Heyst by its air of youth, because he\r\nremembered his father as a much older man; a lot of small objects, such\r\nas candlesticks, inkstands, and statuettes from his father\'s study,\r\nwhich surprised him because they looked so old and so much worn.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the Tropical Belt Coal Company, unpacking them on the\r\nveranda in the shade besieged by a fierce sunshine, must have felt like\r\na remorseful apostate before these relics. He handled them tenderly;\r\nand it was perhaps their presence there which attached him to the island\r\nwhen he woke up to the failure of his apostasy. Whatever the decisive\r\nreason, Heyst had remained where another would have been glad to be off.\r\nThe excellent Davidson had discovered the fact without discovering the\r\nreason, and took a humane interest in Heyst\'s strange existence, while\r\nat the same time his native delicacy kept him from intruding on the\r\nother\'s whim of solitude. He could not possibly guess that Heyst, alone\r\non the island, felt neither more nor less lonely than in any other\r\nplace, desert or populous. Davidson\'s concern was, if one may express it\r\nso, the danger of spiritual starvation; but this was a spirit which had\r\nrenounced all outside nourishment, and was sustaining itself proudly on\r\nits own contempt of the usual coarse ailments which life offers to the\r\ncommon appetites of men.\r\n\r\nNeither was Heyst\'s body in danger of starvation, as Schomberg had so\r\nconfidently asserted. At the beginning of the company\'s operations the\r\nisland had been provisioned in a manner which had outlasted the need.\r\nHeyst did not need to fear hunger; and his very loneliness had not been\r\nwithout some alleviation. Of the crowd of imported Chinese labourers,\r\none at least had remained in Samburan, solitary and strange, like a\r\nswallow left behind at the migrating season of his tribe.\r\n\r\nWang was not a common coolie. He had been a servant to white men before.\r\nThe agreement between him and Heyst consisted in the exchange of a few\r\nwords on the day when the last batch of the mine coolies was leaving\r\nSamburan. Heyst, leaning over the balustrade of the veranda, was looking\r\non, as calm in appearance as though he had never departed from the\r\ndoctrine that this world, for the wise, is nothing but an amusing\r\nspectacle. Wang came round the house, and standing below, raised up his\r\nyellow, thin face.\r\n\r\n"All finished?" he asked. Heyst nodded slightly from above, glancing\r\ntowards the jetty. A crowd of blue-clad figures with yellow faces and\r\ncalves was being hustled down into the boats of the chartered steamer\r\nlying well out, like a painted ship on a painted sea; painted in crude\r\ncolours, without shadows, without feeling, with brutal precision.\r\n\r\n"You had better hurry up if you don\'t want to be left behind."\r\n\r\nBut the Chinaman did not move.\r\n\r\n"We stop," he declared. Heyst looked down at him for the first time.\r\n\r\n"You want to stop here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What were you? What was your work here?"\r\n\r\n"Mess-loom boy."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to stay with me here as my boy?" inquired Heyst, surprised.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman unexpectedly put on a deprecatory expression, and said,\r\nafter a marked pause:\r\n\r\n"Can do."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t," said Heyst, "unless you like. I propose to stay on\r\nhere--it may be for a very long time. I have no power to make you go if\r\nyou wish to remain, but I don\'t see why you should."\r\n\r\n"Catchee one piecee wife," remarked Wang unemotionally, and marched off,\r\nturning his back on the wharf and the great world beyond, represented by\r\nthe steamer waiting for her boats.\r\n\r\nHeyst learned presently that Wang had persuaded one of the women of\r\nAlfuro village, on the west shore of the island, beyond the central\r\nridge, to come over to live with him in a remote part of the company\'s\r\nclearing. It was a curious case, inasmuch as the Alfuros, having been\r\nfrightened by the sudden invasion of Chinamen, had blocked the path over\r\nthe ridge by felling a few trees, and had kept strictly on their own\r\nside. The coolies, as a body, mistrusting the manifest mildness of these\r\nharmless fisher-folk, had kept to their lines, without attempting to\r\ncross the island. Wang was the brilliant exception. He must have been\r\nuncommonly fascinating, in a way that was not apparent to Heyst, or else\r\nuncommonly persuasive. The woman\'s services to Heyst were limited to\r\nthe fact that she had anchored Wang to the spot by her charms, which\r\nremained unknown to the white man, because she never came near the\r\nhouses. The couple lived at the edge of the forest, and she could\r\nsometimes be seen gazing towards the bungalow shading her eyes with her\r\nhand. Even from a distance she appeared to be a shy, wild creature,\r\nand Heyst, anxious not to try her primitive nerves unduly, scrupulously\r\navoided that side of the clearing in his strolls.\r\n\r\nThe day--or rather the first night--after his hermit life began, he was\r\naware of vague sounds of revelry in that direction. Emboldened by the\r\ndeparture of the invading strangers, some Alfuros, the woman\'s friends\r\nand relations, had ventured over the ridge to attend something in the\r\nnature of a wedding feast. Wang had invited them. But this was the only\r\noccasion when any sound louder than the buzzing of insects had troubled\r\nthe profound silence of the clearing. The natives were never invited\r\nagain. Wang not only knew how to live according to conventional\r\nproprieties, but had strong personal views as to the manner of arranging\r\nhis domestic existence. After a time Heyst perceived that Wang had\r\nannexed all the keys. Any keys left lying about vanished after Wang had\r\npassed that way. Subsequently some of them--those that did not belong\r\nto the store-rooms and the empty bungalows, and could not be regarded\r\nas the common property of this community of two--were returned to Heyst,\r\ntied in a bunch with a piece of string. He found them one morning\r\nlying by the side of his plate. He had not been inconvenienced by their\r\nabsence, because he never locked up anything in the way of drawers and\r\nboxes. Heyst said nothing. Wang also said nothing. Perhaps he had always\r\nbeen a taciturn man; perhaps he was influenced by the genius of the\r\nlocality, which was certainly that of silence. Till Heyst and Morrison\r\nhad landed in Black Diamond Bay, and named it, that side of Samburan had\r\nhardly ever heard the sound of human speech. It was easy to be taciturn\r\nwith Heyst, who had plunged himself into an abyss of meditation over\r\nbooks, and remained in it till the shadow of Wang falling across the\r\npage, and the sound of a rough, low voice uttering the Malay word\r\n"makan," would force him to climb out to a meal.\r\n\r\nWang in his native province in China might have been an aggressively,\r\nsensitively genial person; but in Samburan he had clothed himself in\r\na mysterious stolidity and did not seem to resent not being spoken to\r\nexcept in single words, at a rate which did not average half a dozen per\r\nday. And he gave no more than he got. It is to be presumed that if he\r\nsuffered he made up for it with the Alfuro woman. He always went back to\r\nher at the first fall of dusk, vanishing from the bungalow suddenly at\r\nthis hour, like a sort of topsy-turvy, day-hunting, Chinese ghost with a\r\nwhite jacket and a pigtail. Presently, giving way to a Chinaman\'s ruling\r\npassion, he could be observed breaking the ground near his hut, between\r\nthe mighty stumps of felled trees, with a miner\'s pickaxe. After a\r\ntime, he discovered a rusty but serviceable spade in one of the empty\r\nstore-rooms, and it is to be supposed that he got on famously; but\r\nnothing of it could be seen, because he went to the trouble of pulling\r\nto pieces one of the company\'s sheds in order to get materials for\r\nmaking a high and very close fence round his patch, as if the growing\r\nof vegetables were a patented process, or an awful and holy mystery\r\nentrusted to the keeping of his race.\r\n\r\nHeyst, following from a distance the progress of Wang\'s gardening and of\r\nthese precautions--there was nothing else to look at--was amused at\r\nthe thought that he, in his own person, represented the market for\r\nits produce. The Chinaman had found several packets of seeds in the\r\nstore-rooms, and had surrendered to an irresistible impulse to put them\r\ninto the ground. He would make his master pay for the vegetables which\r\nhe was raising to satisfy his instinct. And, looking silently at the\r\nsilent Wang going about his work in the bungalow in his unhasty,\r\nsteady way; Heyst envied the Chinaman\'s obedience to his instincts, the\r\npowerful simplicity of purpose which made his existence appear almost\r\nautomatic in the mysterious precision of its facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nDuring his master\'s absence at Sourabaya, Wang had busied himself with\r\nthe ground immediately in front of the principal bungalow. Emerging\r\nfrom the fringe of grass growing across the shore end of the coal-jetty,\r\nHeyst beheld a broad, clear space, black and level, with only one or two\r\nclumps of charred twigs, where the flame had swept from the front of his\r\nhouse to the nearest trees of the forest.\r\n\r\n"You took the risk of firing the grass?" Heyst asked.\r\n\r\nWang nodded. Hanging on the arm of the white man before whom he stood\r\nwas the girl called Alma; but neither from the Chinaman\'s eyes nor from\r\nhis expression could anyone have guessed that he was in the slightest\r\ndegree aware of the fact.\r\n\r\n"He has been tidying the place in his labour-saving way," explained\r\nHeyst, without looking at the girl, whose hand rested on his forearm.\r\n"He\'s the whole establishment, you see. I told you I hadn\'t even a dog\r\nto keep me company here."\r\n\r\nWang had marched off towards the wharf.\r\n\r\n"He\'s like those waiters in that place," she said. That place was\r\nSchomberg\'s hotel.\r\n\r\n"One Chinaman looks very much like another," Heyst remarked. "We shall\r\nfind it useful to have him here. This is the house."\r\n\r\nThey faced, at some distance, the six shallow steps leading up to the\r\nveranda. The girl had abandoned Heyst\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"This is the house," he repeated.\r\n\r\nShe did not offer to budge away from his side, but stood staring fixedly\r\nat the steps, as if they had been something unique and impracticable. He\r\nwaited a little, but she did not move.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want to go in?" he asked, without turning his head to look at\r\nher. "The sun\'s too heavy to stand about here." He tried to overcome\r\na sort of fear, a sort of impatient faintness, and his voice sounded\r\nrough. "You had better go in," he concluded.\r\n\r\nThey both moved then, but at the foot of the stairs Heyst stopped, while\r\nthe girl went on rapidly, as if nothing could stop her now. She crossed\r\nthe veranda swiftly, and entered the twilight of the big central room\r\nopening upon it, and then the deeper twilight of the room beyond. She\r\nstood still in the dusk, in which her dazzled eyes could scarcely make\r\nout the forms of objects, and sighed a sigh of relief. The impression\r\nof the sunlight, of sea and sky, remained with her like a memory of a\r\npainful trial gone through--done with at last!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Heyst had walked back slowly towards the jetty; but he did not\r\nget so far as that. The practical and automatic Wang had got hold of\r\none of the little trucks that had been used for running baskets of coal\r\nalongside ships. He appeared pushing it before him, loaded lightly with\r\nHeyst\'s bag and the bundle of the girl\'s belongings, wrapped in Mrs.\r\nSchomberg\'s shawl. Heyst turned about and walked by the side of the\r\nrusty rails on which the truck ran. Opposite the house Wang stopped,\r\nlifted the bag to his shoulder, balanced it carefully, and then took the\r\nbundle in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Leave those things on the table in the big room--understand?"\r\n\r\n"Me savee," grunted Wang, moving off.\r\n\r\nHeyst watched the Chinaman disappear from the veranda. It was not till\r\nhe had seen Wang come out that he himself entered the twilight of the\r\nbig room. By that time Wang was out of sight at the back of the house,\r\nbut by no means out of hearing. The Chinaman could hear the voice of\r\nhim who, when there were many people there, was generally referred to\r\nas "Number One." Wang was not able to understand the words, but the tone\r\ninterested him.\r\n\r\n"Where are you?" cried Number One.\r\n\r\nThen Wang heard, much more faint, a voice he had never heard before--a\r\nnovel impression which he acknowledged by cocking his head slightly to\r\none side.\r\n\r\n"I am here--out of the sun."\r\n\r\nThe new voice sounded remote and uncertain. Wang heard nothing more,\r\nthough he waited for some time, very still, the top of his shaven poll\r\nexactly level with the floor of the back veranda. His face meanwhile\r\npreserved an inscrutable immobility. Suddenly he stooped to pick up\r\nthe lid of a deal candle-box which was lying on the ground by his foot.\r\nBreaking it up with his fingers, he directed his steps towards the\r\ncook-shed, where, squatting on his heels, he proceeded to kindle a small\r\nfire under a very sooty kettle, possibly to make tea. Wang had some\r\nknowledge of the more superficial rites and ceremonies of white men\'s\r\nexistence, otherwise so enigmatically remote to his mind, and containing\r\nunexpected possibilities of good and evil, which had to be watched for\r\nwith prudence and care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nThat morning, as on all the others of the full tale of mornings since\r\nhis return with the girl to Samburan, Heyst came out on the veranda and\r\nspread his elbows on the railing, in an easy attitude of proprietorship.\r\nThe bulk of the central ridge of the island cut off the bungalow from\r\nsunrises, whether glorious or cloudy, angry or serene. The dwellers\r\ntherein were debarred from reading early the fortune of the new-born\r\nday. It sprang upon them in its fulness with a swift retreat of the\r\ngreat shadow when the sun, clearing the ridge, looked down, hot and dry,\r\nwith a devouring glare like the eye of an enemy. But Heyst, once the\r\nNumber One of this locality, while it was comparatively teeming with\r\nmankind, appreciated the prolongation of early coolness, the subdued,\r\nlingering half-light, the faint ghost of the departed night, the\r\nfragrance of its dewy, dark soul captured for a moment longer between\r\nthe great glow of the sky and the intense blaze of the uncovered sea.\r\n\r\nIt was naturally difficult for Heyst to keep his mind from dwelling on\r\nthe nature and consequences of this, his latest departure from the part\r\nof an unconcerned spectator. Yet he had retained enough of his wrecked\r\nphilosophy to prevent him from asking himself consciously how it would\r\nend. But at the same time he could not help being temperamentally, from\r\nlong habit and from set purpose, a spectator still, perhaps a little\r\nless naive but (as he discovered with some surprise) not much more far\r\nsighted than the common run of men. Like the rest of us who act, all he\r\ncould say to himself, with a somewhat affected grimness, was:\r\n\r\n"We shall see!"\r\n\r\nThis mood of grim doubt intruded on him only when he was alone. There\r\nwere not many such moments in his day now; and he did not like them when\r\nthey came. On this morning he had no time to grow uneasy. Alma came out\r\nto join him long before the sun, rising above the Samburan ridge, swept\r\nthe cool shadow of the early morning and the remnant of the night\'s\r\ncoolness clear off the roof under which they had dwelt for more than\r\nthree months already. She came out as on other mornings. He had heard\r\nher light footsteps in the big room--the room where he had unpacked the\r\ncases from London; the room now lined with the backs of books halfway up\r\non its three sides. Above the cases the fine matting met the ceiling of\r\ntightly stretched white calico. In the dusk and coolness nothing gleamed\r\nexcept the gilt frame of the portrait of Heyst\'s father, signed by a\r\nfamous painter, lonely in the middle of a wall.\r\n\r\nHeyst did not turn round.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I was thinking of?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No," she said. Her tone betrayed always a shade of anxiety, as though\r\nshe were never certain how a conversation with him would end. She leaned\r\non the guard-rail by his side.\r\n\r\n"No," she repeated. "What was it?" She waited. Then, rather with\r\nreluctance than shyness, she asked:\r\n\r\n"Were you thinking of me?"\r\n\r\n"I was wondering when you would come out," said Heyst, still without\r\nlooking at the girl--to whom, after several experimental essays in\r\ncombining detached letters and loose syllables, he had given the name of\r\nLena.\r\n\r\nShe remarked after a pause:\r\n\r\n"I was not very far from you."\r\n\r\n"Apparently you were not near enough for me."\r\n\r\n"You could have called if you wanted me," she said. "And I wasn\'t so\r\nlong doing my hair."\r\n\r\n"Apparently it was too long for me."\r\n\r\n"Well, you were thinking of me, anyhow. I am glad of it. Do you know,\r\nit seems to me, somehow, that if you were to stop thinking of me I\r\nshouldn\'t be in the world at all!"\r\n\r\nHe turned round and looked at her. She often said things which surprised\r\nhim. A vague smile faded away on her lips before his scrutiny.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he asked. "Is it a reproach?"\r\n\r\n"A reproach! Why, how could it be?" she defended herself.\r\n\r\n"Well, what did it mean?" he insisted.\r\n\r\n"What I said--just what I said. Why aren\'t you fair?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, this is at least a reproach!"\r\n\r\nShe coloured to the roots of her hair.\r\n\r\n"It looks as if you were trying to make out that I am disagreeable," she\r\nmurmured. "Am I? You will make me afraid to open my mouth presently. I\r\nshall end by believing I am no good."\r\n\r\nHer head drooped a little. He looked at her smooth, low brow, the\r\nfaintly coloured cheeks, and the red lips parted slightly, with the\r\ngleam of her teeth within.\r\n\r\n"And then I won\'t be any good," she added with conviction. "That I\r\nwon\'t! I can only be what you think I am."\r\n\r\nHe made a slight movement. She put her hand on his arm, without raising\r\nher head, and went on, her voice animated in the stillness of her body:\r\n\r\n"It is so. It couldn\'t be any other way with a girl like me and a man\r\nlike you. Here we are, we two alone, and I can\'t even tell where we\r\nare."\r\n\r\n"A very well-known spot of the globe," Heyst uttered gently. "There\r\nmust have been at least fifty thousand circulars issued at the time--a\r\nhundred and fifty thousand, more likely. My friend was looking after\r\nthat, and his ideas were large and his belief very strong. Of us two it\r\nwas he who had the faith. A hundred and fifty thousand, certainly."\r\n\r\n"What is it you mean?" she asked in a low tone.\r\n\r\n"What should I find fault with you for?" Heyst went on. "For being\r\namiable, good, gracious--and pretty?"\r\n\r\nA silence fell. Then she said:\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right that you should think that of me. There\'s no one here to\r\nthink anything of us, good or bad."\r\n\r\nThe rare timbre of her voice gave a special value to what she uttered.\r\nThe indefinable emotion which certain intonations gave him, he was\r\naware, was more physical than moral. Every time she spoke to him she\r\nseemed to abandon to him something of herself--something excessively\r\nsubtle and inexpressible, to which he was infinitely sensible, which he\r\nwould have missed horribly if she were to go away. While he was looking\r\ninto her eyes she raised her bare forearm, out of the short sleeve, and\r\nheld it in the air till he noticed it and hastened to pose his great\r\nbronze moustaches on the whiteness of the skin. Then they went in.\r\n\r\nWang immediately appeared in front, and, squatting on his heels, began\r\nto potter mysteriously about some plants at the foot of the veranda.\r\nWhen Heyst and the girl came out again, the Chinaman had gone in his\r\npeculiar manner, which suggested vanishing out of existence rather than\r\nout of sight, a process of evaporation rather than of movement. They\r\ndescended the steps, looking at each other, and started off smartly\r\nacross the cleared ground; but they were not ten yards away when,\r\nwithout perceptible stir or sound, Wang materialized inside the empty\r\nroom. The Chinaman stood still with roaming eyes, examining the walls as\r\nif for signs, for inscriptions; exploring the floor as if for pitfalls,\r\nfor dropped coins. Then he cocked his head slightly at the profile of\r\nHeyst\'s father, pen in hand above a white sheet of paper on a crimson\r\ntablecloth; and, moving forward noiselessly, began to clear away the\r\nbreakfast things.\r\n\r\nThough he proceeded without haste, the unerring precision of his\r\nmovements, the absolute soundlessness of the operation, gave it\r\nsomething of the quality of a conjuring trick. And, the trick having\r\nbeen performed, Wang vanished from the scene, to materialize presently\r\nin front of the house. He materialized walking away from it, with no\r\nvisible or guessable intention; but at the end of some ten paces he\r\nstopped, made a half turn, and put his hand up to shade his eyes. The\r\nsun had topped the grey ridge of Samburan. The great morning shadow was\r\ngone; and far away in the devouring sunshine Wang was in time to see\r\nNumber One and the woman, two remote white specks against the sombre\r\nline of the forest. In a moment they vanished. With the smallest display\r\nof action, Wang also vanished from the sunlight of the clearing.\r\n\r\nHeyst and Lena entered the shade of the forest path which crossed the\r\nisland, and which, near its highest point had been blocked by felled\r\ntrees. But their intention was not to go so far. After keeping to the\r\npath for some distance, they left it at a point where the forest was\r\nbare of undergrowth, and the trees, festooned with creepers, stood clear\r\nof one another in the gloom of their own making. Here and there great\r\nsplashes of light lay on the ground. They moved, silent in the great\r\nstillness, breathing the calmness, the infinite isolation, the repose of\r\na slumber without dreams. They emerged at the upper limit of vegetation,\r\namong some rocks; and in a depression of the sharp slope, like a small\r\nplatform, they turned about and looked from on high over the sea,\r\nlonely, its colour effaced by sunshine, its horizon a heat mist, a mere\r\nunsubstantial shimmer in the pale and blinding infinity overhung by the\r\ndarker blaze of the sky.\r\n\r\n"It makes my head swim," the girl murmured, shutting her eyes and\r\nputting her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHeyst, gazing fixedly to the southward, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Sail ho!"\r\n\r\nA moment of silence ensued.\r\n\r\n"It must be very far away," he went on. "I don\'t think you could see it.\r\nSome native craft making for the Moluccas, probably. Come, we mustn\'t\r\nstay here."\r\n\r\nWith his arm round her waist, he led her down a little distance, and\r\nthey settled themselves in the shade; she, seated on the ground, he a\r\nlittle lower, reclining at her feet.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t like to look at the sea from up there?" he said after a time.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. That empty space was to her the abomination of\r\ndesolation. But she only said again:\r\n\r\n"It makes my head swim."\r\n\r\n"Too big?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Too lonely. It makes my heart sink, too," she added in a low voice, as\r\nif confessing a secret.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid," said Heyst, "that you would be justified in reproaching me\r\nfor these sensations. But what would you have?"\r\n\r\nHis tone was playful, but his eyes, directed at her face, were serious.\r\nShe protested.\r\n\r\n"I am not feeling lonely with you--not a bit. It is only when we come up\r\nto that place, and I look at all that water and all that light--"\r\n\r\n"We will never come here again, then," he interrupted her.\r\n\r\nShe remained silent for a while, returning his gaze till he removed it.\r\n\r\n"It seems as if everything that there is had gone under," she said.\r\n\r\n"Reminds you of the story of the deluge," muttered the man, stretched at\r\nher feet and looking at them. "Are you frightened at it?"\r\n\r\n"I should be rather frightened to be left behind alone. When I say, I,\r\nof course I mean we."\r\n\r\n"Do you?" . . . Heyst remained silent for a while. "The vision of a\r\nworld destroyed," he mused aloud. "Would you be sorry for it?"\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry for the happy people in it," she said simply.\r\n\r\nHis gaze travelled up her figure and reached her face, where he seemed\r\nto detect the veiled glow of intelligence, as one gets a glimpse of the\r\nsun through the clouds.\r\n\r\n"I should have thought it\'s they specially who ought to have been\r\ncongratulated. Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--I understand what you mean; but there were forty days before\r\nit was all over."\r\n\r\n"You seem to be in possession of all the details."\r\n\r\nHeyst spoke just to say something rather than to gaze at her in silence.\r\nShe was not looking at him.\r\n\r\n"Sunday school," she murmured. "I went regularly from the time I\r\nwas eight till I was thirteen. We lodged in the north of London, off\r\nKingsland Road. It wasn\'t a bad time. Father was earning good money\r\nthen. The woman of the house used to pack me off in the afternoon with\r\nher own girls. She was a good woman. Her husband was in the post office.\r\nSorter or something. Such a quiet man. He used to go off after supper\r\nfor night-duty, sometimes. Then one day they had a row, and broke up the\r\nhome. I remember I cried when we had to pack up all of a sudden and go\r\ninto other lodgings. I never knew what it was, though--"\r\n\r\n"The deluge," muttered Heyst absently.\r\n\r\nHe felt intensely aware of her personality, as if this were the first\r\nmoment of leisure he had found to look at her since they had come\r\ntogether. The peculiar timbre of her voice, with its modulations of\r\naudacity and sadness, would have given interest to the most inane\r\nchatter. But she was no chatterer. She was rather silent, with a\r\ncapacity for immobility, an upright stillness, as when resting on the\r\nconcert platform between the musical numbers, her feet crossed, her\r\nhands reposing on her lap. But in the intimacy of their life her grey,\r\nunabashed gaze forced upon him the sensation of something inexplicable\r\nreposing within her; stupidity or inspiration, weakness or force--or\r\nsimply an abysmal emptiness, reserving itself even in the moments of\r\ncomplete surrender.\r\n\r\nDuring a long pause she did not look at him. Then suddenly, as if\r\nthe word "deluge" had stuck in her mind, she asked, looking up at the\r\ncloudless sky:\r\n\r\n"Does it ever rain here?"\r\n\r\n"There is a season when it rains almost every day," said Heyst,\r\nsurprised. "There are also thunderstorms. We once had a \'mud-shower.\'"\r\n\r\n"Mud-shower?"\r\n\r\n"Our neighbour there was shooting up ashes. He sometimes clears his\r\nred-hot gullet like that; and a thunderstorm came along at the\r\nsame time. It was very messy; but our neighbour is generally well\r\nbehaved--just smokes quietly, as he did that day when I first showed\r\nyou the smudge in the sky from the schooner\'s deck. He\'s a good-natured,\r\nlazy fellow of a volcano."\r\n\r\n"I saw a mountain smoking like that before," she said, staring at the\r\nslender stem of a tree-fern some dozen feet in front of her. "It wasn\'t\r\nvery long after we left England--some few days, though. I was so ill at\r\nfirst that I lost count of days. A smoking mountain--I can\'t think how\r\nthey called it."\r\n\r\n"Vesuvius, perhaps," suggested Heyst.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the name."\r\n\r\n"I saw it, too, years, ages ago," said Heyst.\r\n\r\n"On your way here?"\r\n\r\n"No, long before I ever thought of coming into this part of the world. I\r\nwas yet a boy."\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked at him attentively, as if seeking to discover some\r\ntrace of that boyhood in the mature face of the man with the hair\r\nthin at the top and the long, thick moustaches. Heyst stood the frank\r\nexamination with a playful smile, hiding the profound effect these\r\nveiled grey eyes produced--whether on his heart or on his nerves,\r\nwhether sensuous or spiritual, tender or irritating, he was unable to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n"Well, princess of Samburan," he said at last, "have I found favour in\r\nyour sight?"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to wake up, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking," she murmured very low.\r\n\r\n"Thought, action--so many snares! If you begin to think you will be\r\nunhappy."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t thinking of myself!" she declared with a simplicity which took\r\nHeyst aback somewhat.\r\n\r\n"On the lips of a moralist this would sound like a rebuke," he said,\r\nhalf seriously; "but I won\'t suspect you of being one. Moralists and I\r\nhaven\'t been friends for many years."\r\n\r\nShe had listened with an air of attention.\r\n\r\n"I understood you had no friends," she said. "I am pleased that there\'s\r\nnobody to find fault with you for what you have done. I like to think\r\nthat I am in no one\'s way."\r\n\r\nHeyst would have said something, but she did not give him time.\r\nUnconscious of the movement he made she went on:\r\n\r\n"What I was thinking to myself was, why are you here?"\r\n\r\nHeyst let himself sink on his elbow again.\r\n\r\n"If by \'you\' you mean \'we\'--well, you know why we are here."\r\n\r\nShe bent her gaze down at him.\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t that. I meant before--all that time before you came across\r\nme and guessed at once that I was in trouble, with no one to turn to.\r\nAnd you know it was desperate trouble too."\r\n\r\nHer voice fell on the last words, as if she would end there; but there\r\nwas something so expectant in Heyst\'s attitude as he sat at her feet,\r\nlooking up at her steadily, that she continued, after drawing a short,\r\nquick breath:\r\n\r\n"It was, really. I told you I had been worried before by bad fellows.\r\nIt made me unhappy, disturbed--angry, too. But oh, how I hated, hated,\r\nhated that man!"\r\n\r\n"That man" was the florid Schomberg with the military bearing,\r\nbenefactor of white men (\'decent food to eat in decent company\')--mature\r\nvictim of belated passion. The girl shuddered. The characteristic\r\nharmoniousness of her face became, as it were, decomposed for an\r\ninstant. Heyst was startled.\r\n\r\n"Why think of it now?" he cried.\r\n\r\n"It\'s because I was cornered that time. It wasn\'t as before. It was\r\nworse, ever so much. I wished I could die of my fright--and yet it\'s\r\nonly now that I begin to understand what a horror it might have been.\r\nYes, only now, since we--"\r\n\r\nHeyst stirred a little.\r\n\r\n"Came here," he finished.\r\n\r\nHer tenseness relaxed, her flushed face went gradually back to its\r\nnormal tint.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said indifferently, but at the same time she gave him a\r\nstealthy glance of passionate appreciation; and then her face took on a\r\nmelancholy cast, her whole figure drooped imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n"But you were coming back here anyhow?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I was only waiting for Davidson. Yes, I was coming back here, to\r\nthese ruins--to Wang, who perhaps did not expect to see me again. It\'s\r\nimpossible to guess at the way that Chinaman draws his conclusions, and\r\nhow he looks upon one."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk about him. He makes me feel uncomfortable. Talk about\r\nyourself!"\r\n\r\n"About myself? I see you are still busy with the mystery of my existence\r\nhere; but it isn\'t at all mysterious. Primarily the man with the quill\r\npen in his hand in that picture you so often look at is responsible for\r\nmy existence. He is also responsible for what my existence is, or\r\nrather has been. He was a great man in his way. I don\'t know much of his\r\nhistory. I suppose he began like other people; took fine words for good,\r\nringing coin and noble ideals for valuable banknotes. He was a great\r\nmaster of both, himself, by the way. Later he discovered--how am I to\r\nexplain it to you? Suppose the world were a factory and all mankind\r\nworkmen in it. Well, he discovered that the wages were not good enough.\r\nThat they were paid in counterfeit money."\r\n\r\n"I see!" the girl said slowly.\r\n\r\n"Do you?"\r\n\r\nHeyst, who had been speaking as if to himself, looked up curiously.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t a new discovery, but he brought his capacity for scorn to\r\nbear on it. It was immense. It ought to have withered this globe. I\r\ndon\'t know how many minds he convinced. But my mind was very young then,\r\nand youth I suppose can be easily seduced--even by a negation. He was\r\nvery ruthless, and yet he was not without pity. He dominated me without\r\ndifficulty. A heartless man could not have done so. Even to fools he was\r\nnot utterly merciless. He could be indignant, but he was too great for\r\nflouts and jeers. What he said was not meant for the crowd; it could not\r\nbe; and I was flattered to find myself among the elect. They read his\r\nbooks, but I have heard his living word. It was irresistible. It was\r\nas if that mind were taking me into its confidence, giving me a special\r\ninsight into its mastery of despair. Mistake, no doubt. There is\r\nsomething of my father in every man who lives long enough. But they\r\ndon\'t say anything. They can\'t. They wouldn\'t know how, or perhaps,\r\nthey wouldn\'t speak if they could. Man on this earth is an unforeseen\r\naccident which does not stand close investigation. However, that\r\nparticular man died as quietly as a child goes to sleep. But, after\r\nlistening to him, I could not take my soul down into the street to fight\r\nthere. I started off to wander about, an independent spectator--if that\r\nis possible."\r\n\r\nFor a long time the girl\'s grey eyes had been watching his face. She\r\ndiscovered that, addressing her, he was really talking to himself. Heyst\r\nlooked up, caught sight of her as it were, and caught himself up, with a\r\nlow laugh and a change of tone.\r\n\r\n"All this does not tell you why I ever came here. Why, indeed? It\'s like\r\nprying into inscrutable mysteries which are not worth scrutinizing. A\r\nman drifts. The most successful men have drifted into their successes.\r\nI don\'t want to tell you that this is a success. You wouldn\'t believe\r\nme if I did. It isn\'t; neither is it the ruinous failure it looks. It\r\nproves nothing, unless perhaps some hidden weakness in my character--and\r\neven that is not certain."\r\n\r\nHe looked fixedly at her, and with such grave eyes that she felt obliged\r\nto smile faintly at him, since she did not understand what he meant. Her\r\nsmile was reflected, still fainter, on his lips.\r\n\r\n"This does not advance you much in your inquiry," he went on. "And in\r\ntruth your question is unanswerable; but facts have a certain positive\r\nvalue, and I will tell you a fact. One day I met a cornered man. I use\r\nthe word because it expresses the man\'s situation exactly, and because\r\nyou just used it yourself. You know what that means?"\r\n\r\n"What do you say?" she whispered, astounded. "A man!"\r\n\r\nHeyst laughed at her wondering eyes.\r\n\r\n"No! No! I mean in his own way."\r\n\r\n"I knew very well it couldn\'t be anything like that," she observed under\r\nher breath.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t bother you with the story. It was a custom-house affair,\r\nstrange as it may sound to you. He would have preferred to be killed\r\noutright--that is, to have his soul dispatched to another world, rather\r\nthan to be robbed of his substance, his very insignificant substance, in\r\nthis. I saw that he believed in another world because, being cornered,\r\nas I have told you, he went down on his knees and prayed. What do you\r\nthink of that?"\r\n\r\nHeyst paused. She looked at him earnestly.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t make fun of him for that?" she said.\r\n\r\nHeyst made a brusque movement of protest\r\n\r\n"My dear girl, I am not a ruffian," he cried. Then, returning to his\r\nusual tone: "I didn\'t even have to conceal a smile. Somehow it didn\'t\r\nlook a smiling matter. No, it was not funny; it was rather pathetic; he\r\nwas so representative of all the past victims of the Great Joke. But it\r\nis by folly alone that the world moves, and so it is a respectable thing\r\nupon the whole. And besides, he was what one would call a good man. I\r\ndon\'t mean especially because he had offered up a prayer. No! He was\r\nreally a decent fellow, he was quite unfitted for this world, he was a\r\nfailure, a good man cornered--a sight for the gods; for no decent mortal\r\ncares to look at that sort." A thought seemed to occur to him. He turned\r\nhis face to the girl. "And you, who have been cornered too--did you\r\nthink of offering a prayer?"\r\n\r\nNeither her eyes nor a single one of her features moved the least bit.\r\nShe only let fall the words:\r\n\r\n"I am not what they call a good girl."\r\n\r\n"That sounds evasive," said Heyst after a short silence. "Well, the good\r\nfellow did pray and after he had confessed to it I was struck by the\r\ncomicality of the situation. No, don\'t misunderstand me--I am not\r\nalluding to his act, of course. And even the idea of Eternity, Infinity,\r\nOmnipotence, being called upon to defeat the conspiracy of two miserable\r\nPortuguese half-castes did not move my mirth. From the point of view of\r\nthe supplicant, the danger to be conjured was something like the end\r\nof the world, or worse. No! What captivated my fancy was that I, Axel\r\nHeyst, the most detached of creatures in this earthly captivity, the\r\nveriest tramp on this earth, an indifferent stroller going through the\r\nworld\'s bustle--that I should have been there to step into the situation\r\nof an agent of Providence. I, a man of universal scorn and unbelief. . .\r\n."\r\n\r\n"You are putting it on," she interrupted in her seductive voice, with a\r\ncoaxing intonation.\r\n\r\n"No. I am not like that, born or fashioned, or both. I am not for\r\nnothing the son of my father, of that man in the painting. I am he, all\r\nbut the genius. And there is even less in me than I make out, because\r\nthe very scorn is falling away from me year after year. I have never\r\nbeen so amused as by that episode in which I was suddenly called to act\r\nsuch an incredible part. For a moment I enjoyed it greatly. It got him\r\nout of his corner, you know."\r\n\r\n"You saved a man for fun--is that what you mean? Just for fun?"\r\n\r\n"Why this tone of suspicion?" remonstrated Heyst. "I suppose the sight\r\nof this particular distress was disagreeable to me. What you call fun\r\ncame afterwards, when it dawned on me that I was for him a walking,\r\nbreathing, incarnate proof of the efficacy of prayer. I was a little\r\nfascinated by it--and then, could I have argued with him? You don\'t\r\nargue against such evidence, and besides it would have looked as if\r\nI had wanted to claim all the merit. Already his gratitude was simply\r\nfrightful. Funny position, wasn\'t it? The boredom came later, when we\r\nlived together on board his ship. I had, in a moment of inadvertence,\r\ncreated for myself a tie. How to define it precisely I don\'t know. One\r\ngets attached in a way to people one has done something for. But is that\r\nfriendship? I am not sure what it was. I only know that he who forms a\r\ntie is lost. The germ of corruption has entered into his soul."\r\n\r\nHeyst\'s tone was light, with the flavour of playfulness which seasoned\r\nall his speeches and seemed to be of the very essence of his thoughts.\r\nThe girl he had come across, of whom he had possessed himself, to whose\r\npresence he was not yet accustomed, with whom he did not yet know how to\r\nlive; that human being so near and still so strange, gave him a greater\r\nsense of his own reality than he had ever known in all his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nWith her knees drawn up, Lena rested her elbows on them and held her\r\nhead in both her hands.\r\n\r\n"Are you tired of sitting here?" Heyst asked.\r\n\r\nAn almost imperceptible negative movement of the head was all the answer\r\nshe made.\r\n\r\n"Why are you looking so serious?" he pursued, and immediately thought\r\nthat habitual seriousness, in the long run, was much more bearable than\r\nconstant gaiety. "However, this expression suits you exceedingly," he\r\nadded, not diplomatically, but because, by the tendency of his taste,\r\nit was a true statement. "And as long as I can be certain that it is not\r\nboredom which gives you this severe air, I am willing to sit here and\r\nlook at you till you are ready to go."\r\n\r\nAnd this was true. He was still under the fresh sortilege of their\r\ncommon life, the surprise of novelty, the flattered vanity of his\r\npossession of this woman; for a man must feel that, unless he has ceased\r\nto be masculine. Her eyes moved in his direction, rested on him,\r\nthen returned to their stare into the deeper gloom at the foot of the\r\nstraight tree-trunks, whose spreading crowns were slowly withdrawing\r\ntheir shade. The warm air stirred slightly about her motionless head.\r\nShe would not look at him, from some obscure fear of betraying herself.\r\nShe felt in her innermost depths an irresistible desire to give herself\r\nup to him more completely, by some act of absolute sacrifice. This was\r\nsomething of which he did not seem to have an idea. He was a strange\r\nbeing without needs. She felt his eyes fixed upon her; and as he kept\r\nsilent, she said uneasily--for she didn\'t know what his silences might\r\nmean:\r\n\r\n"And so you lived with that friend--that good man?"\r\n\r\n"Excellent fellow," Heyst responded, with a readiness that she did not\r\nexpect. "But it was a weakness on my part. I really didn\'t want to, only\r\nhe wouldn\'t let me off, and I couldn\'t explain. He was the sort of man\r\nto whom you can\'t explain anything. He was extremely sensitive, and it\r\nwould have been a tigerish thing to do to mangle his delicate feelings\r\nby the sort of plain speaking that would have been necessary. His\r\nmind was like a white-walled, pure chamber, furnished with, say, six\r\nstraw-bottomed chairs, and he was always placing and displacing them\r\nin various combinations. But they were always the same chairs. He was\r\nextremely easy to live with; but then he got hold of this coal idea--or,\r\nrather, the idea got hold of him, it entered into that scantily\r\nfurnished chamber of which I have just spoken, and sat on all the\r\nchairs. There was no dislodging it, you know! It was going to make his\r\nfortune, my fortune, everybody\'s fortune. In past years, in moments of\r\ndoubt that will come to a man determined to remain free from absurdities\r\nof existence, I often asked myself, with a momentary dread, in what way\r\nwould life try to get hold of me? And this was the way. He got it into\r\nhis head that he could do nothing without me. And was I now, he asked\r\nme, to spurn and ruin him? Well, one morning--I wonder if he had gone\r\ndown on his knees to pray that night!--one morning I gave in."\r\n\r\nHeyst tugged violently at a tuft of dried grass, and cast it away from\r\nhim with a nervous gesture.\r\n\r\n"I gave in," he repeated.\r\n\r\nLooking towards him with a movement of her eyes only, the girl noticed\r\nthe strong feeling on his face with that intense interest which his\r\nperson awakened in her mind and in her heart. But it soon passed away,\r\nleaving only a moody expression.\r\n\r\n"It\'s difficult to resist where nothing matters," he observed. "And\r\nperhaps there is a grain of freakishness in my nature. It amused me\r\nto go about uttering silly, commonplace phrases. I was never so well\r\nthought of in the islands till I began to jabber commercial gibberish\r\nlike the veriest idiot. Upon my word, I believe that I was actually\r\nrespected for a time. I was as grave as an owl over it; I had to be\r\nloyal to the man. I have been, from first to last, completely, utterly\r\nloyal to the best of my ability. I thought he understood something about\r\ncoal. And if I had been aware that he knew nothing of it, as in fact he\r\ndidn\'t, well--I don\'t know what I could have done to stop him. In one\r\nway or another I should have had to be loyal. Truth, work, ambition,\r\nlove itself, may be only counters in the lamentable or despicable game\r\nof life, but when one takes a hand one must play the game. No, the shade\r\nof Morrison needn\'t haunt me. What\'s the matter? I say, Lena, why are\r\nyou staring like that? Do you feel ill?"\r\n\r\nHeyst made as if to get on his feet. The girl extended her arm to arrest\r\nhim, and he remained staring in a sitting posture, propped on one arm,\r\nobserving her indefinable expression of anxiety, as if she were unable\r\nto draw breath.\r\n\r\n"What has come to you?" he insisted, feeling strangely unwilling to\r\nmove, to touch her.\r\n\r\n"Nothing!" She swallowed painfully. "Of course it can\'t be. What name\r\ndid you say? I didn\'t hear it properly."\r\n\r\n"Name?" repeated Heyst dazedly. "I only mentioned Morrison. It\'s the\r\nname of that man of whom I\'ve been speaking. What of it?"\r\n\r\n"And you mean to say that he was your friend?"\r\n\r\n"You have heard enough to judge for yourself. You know as much of our\r\nconnection as I know myself. The people in this part of the world\r\nwent by appearances, and called us friends, as far as I can remember.\r\nAppearances--what more, what better can you ask for? In fact you can\'t\r\nhave better. You can\'t have anything else."\r\n\r\n"You are trying to confuse me with your talk," she cried. "You can\'t\r\nmake fun of this."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t? Well, no I can\'t. It\'s a pity. Perhaps it would have been the\r\nbest way," said Heyst, in a tone which for him could be called gloomy.\r\n"Unless one could forget the silly business altogether." His faint\r\nplayfulness of manner and speech returned, like a habit one has schooled\r\noneself into, even before his forehead had cleared completely. "But why\r\nare you looking so hard at me? Oh, I don\'t object, and I shall try not\r\nto flinch. Your eyes--"\r\n\r\nHe was looking straight into them, and as a matter of fact had forgotten\r\nall about the late Morrison at that moment.\r\n\r\n"No," he exclaimed suddenly. "What an impenetrable girl you are Lena,\r\nwith those grey eyes of yours! Windows of the soul, as some poet has\r\nsaid. The fellow must have been a glazier by vocation. Well, nature has\r\nprovided excellently for the shyness of your soul."\r\n\r\nWhen he ceased speaking, the girl came to herself with a catch of her\r\nbreath. He heard her voice, the varied charm of which he thought he knew\r\nso well, saying with an unfamiliar intonation:\r\n\r\n"And that partner of yours is dead?"\r\n\r\n"Morrison? Oh, yes, as I\'ve told you, he--"\r\n\r\n"You never told me."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I? I thought I did; or, rather, I thought you must know. It\r\nseems impossible that anybody with whom I speak should not know that\r\nMorrison is dead."\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyelids, and Heyst was startled by something like an\r\nexpression of horror on her face.\r\n\r\n"Morrison!" she whispered in an appalled tone. "Morrison!" Her head\r\ndrooped. Unable to see her features, Heyst could tell from her voice\r\nthat for some reason or other she was profoundly moved by the syllables\r\nof that unromantic name. A thought flashed through his head--could she\r\nhave known Morrison? But the mere difference of their origins made it\r\nwildly improbable.\r\n\r\n"This is very extraordinary!" he said. "Have you ever heard the name\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\nHer head moved quickly several times in tiny affirmative nods, as if she\r\ncould not trust herself to speak, or even to look at him. She was biting\r\nher lower lip.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever know anybody of that name?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe girl answered by a negative sign; and then at last she spoke,\r\njerkily, as if forcing herself against some doubt or fear. She had heard\r\nof that very man, she told Heyst.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" he said positively. "You are mistaken. You couldn\'t have\r\nheard of him, it\'s--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, with the thought that to talk like this was perfectly\r\nuseless; that one doesn\'t argue against thin air.\r\n\r\n"But I did hear of him; only I didn\'t know then, I couldn\'t guess, that\r\nit was your partner they were talking about."\r\n\r\n"Talking about my partner?" repeated Heyst slowly.\r\n\r\n"No." Her mind seemed almost as bewildered, as full of incredulity, as\r\nhis. "No. They were talking of you really; only I didn\'t know it."\r\n\r\n"Who were they?" Heyst raised his voice. "Who was talking of me? Talking\r\nwhere?"\r\n\r\nWith the first question he had lifted himself from his reclining\r\nposition; at the last he was on his knees before her, their heads on a\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n"Why, in that town, in that hotel. Where else could it have been?" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe idea of being talked about was always novel to Heyst\'s simplified\r\nconception of himself. For a moment he was as much surprised as if he\r\nhad believed himself to be a mere gliding shadow among men. Besides,\r\nhe had in him a half-unconscious notion that he was above the level of\r\nisland gossip.\r\n\r\n"But you said first that it was of Morrison they talked," he remarked to\r\nthe girl, sinking on his heels, and no longer much interested. "Strange\r\nthat you should have the opportunity to hear any talk at all! I was\r\nrather under the impression that you never saw anybody belonging to the\r\ntown except from the platform."\r\n\r\n"You forget that I was not living with the other girls," she said.\r\n"After meals they used to go back to the Pavilion, but I had to stay in\r\nthe hotel and do my sewing, or what not, in the room where they talked."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think of that. By the by, you never told me who they were."\r\n\r\n"Why, that horrible red-faced beast," she said, with all the energy of\r\ndisgust which the mere thought of the hotel-keeper provoked in her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Schomberg!" Heyst murmured carelessly.\r\n\r\n"He talked to the boss--to Zangiacomo, I mean. I had to sit there. That\r\ndevil-woman sometimes wouldn\'t let me go away. I mean Mrs. Zangiacomo."\r\n\r\n"I guessed," murmured Heyst. "She liked to torment you in a variety\r\nof ways. But it is really strange that the hotel-keeper should talk of\r\nMorrison to Zangiacomo. As far as I can remember he saw very little of\r\nMorrison professionally. He knew many others much better."\r\n\r\nThe girl shuddered slightly.\r\n\r\n"That was the only name I ever overheard. I would get as far away from\r\nthem as I could, to the other end of the room, but when that beast\r\nstarted shouting I could not help hearing. I wish I had never heard\r\nanything. If I had got up and gone out of the room I don\'t suppose the\r\nwoman would have killed me for it; but she would have rowed me in a\r\nnasty way. She would have threatened me and called me names. That sort,\r\nwhen they know you are helpless, there\'s nothing to stop them. I don\'t\r\nknow how it is, but bad people, real bad people that you can see are\r\nbad, they get over me somehow. It\'s the way they set about downing one.\r\nI am afraid of wickedness."\r\n\r\nHeyst watched the changing expressions of her face. He encouraged her,\r\nprofoundly sympathetic, a little amused.\r\n\r\n"I quite understand. You needn\'t apologize for your great delicacy in\r\nthe perception of inhuman evil. I am a little like you."\r\n\r\n"I am not very plucky," she said.\r\n\r\n"Well! I don\'t know myself what I would do, what countenance I would\r\nhave before a creature which would strike me as being evil incarnate.\r\nDon\'t you be ashamed!"\r\n\r\nShe sighed, looked up with her pale, candid gaze and a timid expression\r\non her face, and murmured:\r\n\r\n"You don\'t seem to want to know what he was saying."\r\n\r\n"About poor Morrison? It couldn\'t have been anything bad, for the poor\r\nfellow was innocence itself. And then, you know, he is dead, and nothing\r\ncan possibly matter to him now."\r\n\r\n"But I tell you that it was of you he was talking!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"He was saying that Morrison\'s partner first got all there was to get\r\nout of him, and then, and then--well, as good as murdered him--sent him\r\nout to die somewhere!"\r\n\r\n"You believe that of me?" said Heyst, after a moment of perfect silence.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know it had anything to do with you. Schomberg was talking\r\nof some Swede. How was I to know? It was only when you began telling me\r\nabout how you came here--"\r\n\r\n"And now you have my version." Heyst forced himself to speak quietly.\r\n"So that\'s how the business looked from outside!" he muttered.\r\n\r\n"I remember him saying that everybody in these parts knew the story,"\r\nthe girl added breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"Strange that it should hurt me!" mused Heyst to himself; "yet it does.\r\nI seem to be as much of a fool as those everybodies who know the story\r\nand no doubt believe it. Can you remember any more?" he addressed the\r\ngirl in a grimly polite tone. "I\'ve often heard of the moral advantages\r\nof seeing oneself as others see one. Let us investigate further. Can\'t\r\nyou recall something else that everybody knows?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Don\'t laugh!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"Did I laugh? I assure you I was not aware of it. I won\'t ask you\r\nwhether you believe the hotel-keeper\'s version. Surely you must know the\r\nvalue of human judgement!"\r\n\r\nShe unclasped her hands, moved them slightly, and twined her fingers as\r\nbefore. Protest? Assent? Was there to be nothing more? He was relieved\r\nwhen she spoke in that warm and wonderful voice which in itself\r\ncomforted and fascinated one\'s heart, which made her lovable.\r\n\r\n"I heard this before you and I ever spoke to each other. It went out of\r\nmy memory afterwards. Everything went out of my memory then; and I was\r\nglad of it. It was a fresh start for me, with you--and you know it. I\r\nwish I had forgotten who I was--that would have been best; and I very\r\nnearly did forget."\r\n\r\nHe was moved by the vibrating quality of the last words. She seemed to\r\nbe talking low of some wonderful enchantment, in mysterious terms of\r\nspecial significance. He thought that if she only could talk to him\r\nin some unknown tongue, she would enslave him altogether by the sheer\r\nbeauty of the sound, suggesting infinite depths of wisdom and feeling.\r\n\r\n"But," she went on, "the name stuck in my head, it seems; and when you\r\nmentioned it--"\r\n\r\n"It broke the spell," muttered Heyst in angry disappointment as if he\r\nhad been deceived in some hope.\r\n\r\nThe girl, from her position a little above him, surveyed with still\r\neyes the abstracted silence of the man on whom she now depended with\r\na completeness of which she had not been vividly conscious before,\r\nbecause, till then, she had never felt herself swinging between the\r\nabysses of earth and heaven in the hollow of his arm. What if he should\r\ngrow weary of the burden?\r\n\r\n"And, moreover, nobody had ever believed that tale!"\r\n\r\nHeyst came out with an abrupt burst of sound which made her open her\r\nsteady eyes wider, with an effect of immense surprise. It was a purely\r\nmechanical effect, because she was neither surprised nor puzzled. In\r\nfact, she could understand him better then than at any moment since she\r\nfirst set eyes on him.\r\n\r\nHe laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n"What am I thinking of?" he cried. "As if it could matter to me what\r\nanybody had ever said or believed, from the beginning of the world till\r\nthe crack of doom!"\r\n\r\n"I never heard you laugh till today," she observed. "This is the second\r\ntime!"\r\n\r\nHe scrambled to his feet and towered above her.\r\n\r\n"That\'s because, when one\'s heart has been broken into in the way you\r\nhave broken into mine, all sorts of weaknesses are free to enter--shame,\r\nanger, stupid indignation, stupid fears--stupid laughter, too. I wonder\r\nwhat interpretation you are putting on it?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t gay, certainly," she said. "But why are you angry with me?\r\nAre you sorry you took me away from those beasts? I told you who I was.\r\nYou could see it."\r\n\r\n"Heavens!" he muttered. He had regained his command of himself. "I\r\nassure you I could see much more than you could tell me. I could see\r\nquite a lot that you don\'t even suspect yet, but you can\'t be seen quite\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\nHe sank to the ground by her side and took her hand. She asked gently:\r\n\r\n"What more do you want from me?"\r\n\r\nHe made no sound for a time.\r\n\r\n"The impossible, I suppose," he said very low, as one makes a\r\nconfidence, and pressing the hand he grasped.\r\n\r\nIt did not return the pressure. He shook his head as if to drive away\r\nthe thought of this, and added in a louder, light tone:\r\n\r\n"Nothing less. And it isn\'t because I think little of what I\'ve got\r\nalready. Oh, no! It is because I think so much of this possession of\r\nmine that I can\'t have it complete enough. I know it\'s unreasonable. You\r\ncan\'t hold back anything--now."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I couldn\'t," she whispered, letting her hand lie passive in his\r\ntight grasp. "I only wish I could give you something more, or better, or\r\nwhatever it is you want."\r\n\r\nHe was touched by the sincere accent of these simple words.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what you can do--you can tell me whether you would have gone\r\nwith me like this if you had known of whom that abominable idiot of a\r\nhotel-keeper was speaking. A murderer--no less!"\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t know you at all then," she cried. "And I had the sense to\r\nunderstand what he was saying. It wasn\'t murder, really. I never thought\r\nit was."\r\n\r\n"What made him invent such an atrocity?" Heyst exclaimed. "He seems\r\na stupid animal. He is stupid. How did he manage to hatch that pretty\r\ntale? Have I a particularly vile countenance? Is black selfishness\r\nwritten all over my face? Or is that sort of thing so universally human\r\nthat it might be said of anybody?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t murder," she insisted earnestly.\r\n\r\n"I know. I understand. It was worse. As to killing a man, which would be\r\na comparatively decent thing to do, well--I have never done that."\r\n\r\n"Why should you do it?" she asked in a frightened voice.\r\n\r\n"My dear girl, you don\'t know the sort of life I have been leading in\r\nunexplored countries, in the wilds; it\'s difficult to give you an idea.\r\nThere are men who haven\'t been in such tight places as I have found\r\nmyself in who have had to--to shed blood, as the saying is. Even the\r\nwilds hold prizes which tempt some people; but I had no schemes, no\r\nplans--and not even great firmness of mind to make me unduly obstinate.\r\nI was simply moving on, while the others, perhaps, were going somewhere.\r\nAn indifference as to roads and purposes makes one meeker, as it were.\r\nAnd I may say truly, too, that I never did care, I won\'t say for life--I\r\nhad scorned what people call by that name from the first--but for being\r\nalive. I don\'t know if that is what men call courage, but I doubt it\r\nvery much."\r\n\r\n"You! You have no courage?" she protested.\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know. Not the sort that always itches for a weapon, for\r\nI have never been anxious to use one in the quarrels that a man gets\r\ninto in the most innocent way sometimes. The differences for which\r\nmen murder each other are, like everything else they do, the most\r\ncontemptible, the most pitiful things to look back upon. No, I\'ve never\r\nkilled a man or loved a woman--not even in my thoughts, not even in my\r\ndreams."\r\n\r\nHe raised her hand to his lips, and let them rest on it for a space,\r\nduring which she moved a little closer to him. After the lingering kiss\r\nhe did not relinquish his hold.\r\n\r\n"To slay, to love--the greatest enterprises of life upon a man! And I\r\nhave no experience of either. You must forgive me anything that may have\r\nappeared to you awkward in my behaviour, inexpressive in my speeches,\r\nuntimely in my silences."\r\n\r\nHe moved uneasily, a little disappointed by her attitude, but indulgent\r\nto it, and feeling, in this moment of perfect quietness, that in holding\r\nher surrendered hand he had found a closer communion than they had ever\r\nachieved before. But even then there still lingered in him a sense of\r\nincompleteness not altogether overcome--which, it seemed, nothing ever\r\nwould overcome--the fatal imperfection of all the gifts of life, which\r\nmakes of them a delusion and a snare.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden he squeezed her hand angrily. His delicately playful\r\nequanimity, the product of kindness and scorn, had perished with the\r\nloss of his bitter liberty.\r\n\r\n"Not murder, you say! I should think not. But when you led me to talk\r\njust now, when the name turned up, when you understood that it was of me\r\nthat these things had been said, you showed a strange emotion. I could\r\nsee it."\r\n\r\n"I was a bit startled," she said.\r\n\r\n"At the baseness of my conduct?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t judge you, not for anything."\r\n\r\n"Really?"\r\n\r\n"It would be as if I dared to judge everything that there is." With her\r\nother hand she made a gesture that seemed to embrace in one movement the\r\nearth and the heaven. "I wouldn\'t do such a thing."\r\n\r\nThen came a silence, broken at last by Heyst:\r\n\r\n"I! I! do a deadly wrong to my poor Morrison!" he cried. "I, who could\r\nnot bear to hurt his feelings. I, who respected his very madness! Yes,\r\nthis madness, the wreck of which you can see lying about the jetty of\r\nDiamond Bay. What else could I do? He insisted on regarding me as his\r\nsaviour; he was always restraining the eternal obligation on the tip of\r\nhis tongue, till I was burning with shame at his gratitude. What could I\r\ndo? He was going to repay me with this infernal coal, and I had to join\r\nhim as one joins a child\'s game in a nursery. One would no more have\r\nthought of humiliating him than one would think of humiliating a child.\r\nWhat\'s the use of talking of all this! Of course, the people here\r\ncould not understand the truth of our relation to each other. But what\r\nbusiness of theirs was it? Kill old Morrison! Well, it is less criminal,\r\nless base--I am not saying it is less difficult--to kill a man than to\r\ncheat him in that way. You understand that?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded slightly, but more than once and with evident conviction. His\r\neyes rested on her, inquisitive, ready for tenderness.\r\n\r\n"But it was neither one nor the other," he went on. "Then, why your\r\nemotion? All you confess is that you wouldn\'t judge me."\r\n\r\nShe turned upon him her veiled, unseeing grey eyes in which nothing of\r\nher wonder could be read.\r\n\r\n"I said I couldn\'t," she whispered.\r\n\r\n"But you thought that there was no smoke without fire!" the playfulness\r\nof tone hardly concealed his irritation. "What power there must be in\r\nwords, only imperfectly heard--for you did not listen with particular\r\ncare, did you? What were they? What evil effort of invention drove them\r\ninto that idiot\'s mouth out of his lying throat? If you were to try to\r\nremember, they would perhaps convince me, too."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t listen," she protested. "What was it to me what they said of\r\nanybody? He was saying that there never were such loving friends to\r\nlook at as you two; then, when you got all you wanted out of him and got\r\nthoroughly tired of him, too, you kicked him out to go home and die."\r\n\r\nIndignation, with an undercurrent of some other feeling, rang in these\r\nquoted words, uttered in her pure and enchanting voice. She ceased\r\nabruptly and lowered her long, dark lashes, as if mortally weary, sick\r\nat heart.\r\n\r\n"Of course, why shouldn\'t you get tired of that or any other--company?\r\nYou aren\'t like anyone else, and--and the thought of it made me unhappy\r\nsuddenly; but indeed, I did not believe anything bad of you. I--"\r\n\r\nA brusque movement of his arm, flinging her hand away, stopped her\r\nshort. Heyst had again lost control of himself. He would have shouted,\r\nif shouting had been in his character.\r\n\r\n"No, this earth must be the appointed hatching planet of calumny enough\r\nto furnish the whole universe. I feel a disgust at my own person, as if\r\nI had tumbled into some filthy hole. Pah! And you--all you can say is\r\nthat you won\'t judge me; that you--"\r\n\r\nShe raised her head at this attack, though indeed he had not turned to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe anything bad of you," she repeated. "I couldn\'t."\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture as if to say:\r\n\r\n"That\'s sufficient."\r\n\r\nIn his soul and in his body he experienced a nervous reaction from\r\ntenderness. All at once, without transition, he detested her. But only\r\nfor a moment. He remembered that she was pretty, and, more, that she\r\nhad a special grace in the intimacy of life. She had the secret of\r\nindividuality which excites--and escapes.\r\n\r\nHe jumped up and began to walk to and fro. Presently his hidden fury\r\nfell into dust within him, like a crazy structure, leaving behind\r\nemptiness, desolation, regret. His resentment was not against the girl,\r\nbut against life itself--that commonest of snares, in which he felt\r\nhimself caught, seeing clearly the plot of plots and unconsoled by the\r\nlucidity of his mind.\r\n\r\nHe swerved and, stepping up to her, sank to the ground by her side.\r\nBefore she could make a movement or even turn her head his way, he took\r\nher in his arms and kissed her lips. He tasted on them the bitterness\r\nof a tear fallen there. He had never seen her cry. It was like another\r\nappeal to his tenderness--a new seduction. The girl glanced round,\r\nmoved suddenly away, and averted her face. With her hand she signed\r\nimperiously to him to leave her alone--a command which Heyst did not\r\nobey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\nWhen she opened her eyes at last and sat up, Heyst scrambled quickly to\r\nhis feet and went to pick up her cork helmet, which had rolled a little\r\nway off. Meanwhile she busied herself in doing up her hair, plaited on\r\nthe top of her head in two heavy, dark tresses, which had come loose. He\r\ntendered her the helmet in silence, and waited as if unwilling to hear\r\nthe sound of his own voice.\r\n\r\n"We had better go down now," he suggested in a low tone.\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand to help her up. He had the intention to smile,\r\nbut abandoned it at the nearer sight of her still face, in which was\r\ndepicted the infinite lassitude of her soul. On their way to regain the\r\nforest path they had to pass through the spot from which the view of\r\nthe sea could be obtained. The flaming abyss of emptiness, the liquid,\r\nundulating glare, the tragic brutality of the light, made her long for\r\nthe friendly night, with its stars stilled by an austere spell; for the\r\nvelvety dark sky and the mysterious great shadow of the sea, conveying\r\npeace to the day-weary heart. She put her hand to her eyes. Behind her\r\nback Heyst spoke gently.\r\n\r\n"Let us get on, Lena."\r\n\r\nShe walked ahead in silence. Heyst remarked that they had never been\r\nout before during the hottest hours. It would do her no good, he feared.\r\nThis solicitude pleased and soothed her. She felt more and more like\r\nherself--a poor London girl playing in an orchestra, and snatched out\r\nfrom the humiliations, the squalid dangers of a miserable existence,\r\nby a man like whom there was not, there could not be, another in this\r\nworld. She felt this with elation, with uneasiness, with an intimate\r\npride--and with a peculiar sinking of the heart.\r\n\r\n"I am not easily knocked out by any such thing as heat," she said\r\ndecisively.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I don\'t forget that you\'re not a tropical bird."\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t born in these parts, either," she returned.\r\n\r\n"No, and perhaps I haven\'t even your physique. I am a transplanted\r\nbeing. Transplanted! I ought to call myself uprooted--an unnatural state\r\nof existence; but a man is supposed to stand anything."\r\n\r\nShe looked back at him and received a smile. He told her to keep in the\r\nshelter of the forest path, which was very still and close, full of heat\r\nif free from glare. Now and then they had glimpses of the company\'s old\r\nclearing blazing with light, in which the black stumps of trees stood\r\ncharred, without shadows, miserable and sinister. They crossed the open\r\nin a direct line for the bungalow. On the veranda they fancied they had\r\na glimpse of the vanishing Wang, though the girl was not at all sure\r\nthat she had seen anything move. Heyst had no doubts.\r\n\r\n"Wang has been looking out for us. We are late."\r\n\r\n"Was he? I thought I saw something white for a moment, and then I did\r\nnot see it any more."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it--he vanishes. It\'s a very remarkable gift in that Chinaman."\r\n\r\n"Are they all like that?" she asked with naive curiosity and uneasiness.\r\n\r\n"Not in such perfection," said Heyst, amused.\r\n\r\nHe noticed with approval that she was not heated by the walk. The drops\r\nof perspiration on her forehead were like dew on the cool, white petal\r\nof a flower. He looked at her figure of grace and strength, solid and\r\nsupple, with an ever-growing appreciation.\r\n\r\n"Go in and rest yourself for a quarter of an hour; and then Mr. Wang\r\nwill give us something to eat," he said.\r\n\r\nThey had found the table laid. When they came together again and sat\r\ndown to it, Wang materialized without a sound, unheard, uncalled, and\r\ndid his office. Which being accomplished, at a given moment he was not.\r\n\r\nA great silence brooded over Samburan--the silence of the great heat\r\nthat seems pregnant with fatal issues, like the silence of ardent\r\nthought. Heyst remained alone in the big room. The girl seeing him\r\ntake up a book, had retreated to her chamber. Heyst sat down under\r\nhis father\'s portrait; and the abominable calumny crept back into his\r\nrecollection. The taste of it came on his lips, nauseating and corrosive\r\nlike some kinds of poison. He was tempted to spit on the floor, naively,\r\nin sheer unsophisticated disgust of the physical sensation. He shook his\r\nhead, surprised at himself. He was not used to receive his intellectual\r\nimpressions in that way--reflected in movements of carnal emotion. He\r\nstirred impatiently in his chair, and raised the book to his eyes with\r\nboth hands. It was one of his father\'s. He opened it haphazard, and\r\nhis eyes fell on the middle of the page. The elder Heyst had written of\r\neverything in many books--of space and of time, of animals and of stars;\r\nanalysing ideas and actions, the laughter and the frowns of men, and the\r\ngrimaces of their agony. The son read, shrinking into himself, composing\r\nhis face as if under the author\'s eye, with a vivid consciousness of\r\nthe portrait on his right hand, a little above his head; a wonderful\r\npresence in its heavy frame on the flimsy wall of mats, looking exiled\r\nand at home, out of place and masterful, in the painted immobility of\r\nprofile.\r\n\r\nAnd Heyst, the son, read:\r\n\r\nOf the stratagems of life the most cruel is the consolation of love--the\r\nmost subtle, too; for the desire is the bed of dreams.\r\n\r\nHe turned the pages of the little volume, "Storm and Dust," glancing\r\nhere and there at the broken text of reflections, maxims, short phrases,\r\nenigmatical sometimes and sometimes eloquent. It seemed to him that he\r\nwas hearing his father\'s voice, speaking and ceasing to speak again.\r\nStartled at first, he ended by finding a charm in the illusion. He\r\nabandoned himself to the half-belief that something of his father dwelt\r\nyet on earth--a ghostly voice, audible to the ear of his own flesh and\r\nblood. With what strange serenity, mingled with terrors, had that man\r\nconsidered the universal nothingness! He had plunged into it headlong,\r\nperhaps to render death, the answer that faced one at every inquiry,\r\nmore supportable.\r\n\r\nHeyst stirred, and the ghostly voice ceased; but his eyes followed the\r\nwords on the last page of the book:\r\n\r\nMen of tormented conscience, or of a criminal imagination, are aware of\r\nmuch that minds of a peaceful, resigned cast do not even suspect. It is\r\nnot poets alone who dare descend into the abyss of infernal regions, or\r\neven who dream of such a descent. The most inexpressive of human beings\r\nmust have said to himself, at one time or another: "Anything but this!"\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nWe all have our instants of clairvoyance. They are not very helpful.\r\nThe character of the scheme does not permit that or anything else to\r\nbe helpful. Properly speaking its character, judged by the standards\r\nestablished by its victims, is infamous. It excuses every violence of\r\nprotest and at the same time never fails to crush it, just as it\r\ncrushes the blindest assent. The so-called wickedness must be, like the\r\nso-called virtue, its own reward--to be anything at all . . .\r\n\r\nClairvoyance or no clairvoyance, men love their captivity. To the\r\nunknown force of negation they prefer the miserably tumbled bed of their\r\nservitude. Man alone can give one the disgust of pity; yet I find it\r\neasier to believe in the misfortune of mankind than in its wickedness.\r\n\r\nThese were the last words. Heyst lowered the book to his knees. Lena\'s\r\nvoice spoke above his drooping head:\r\n\r\n"You sit there as if you were unhappy."\r\n\r\n"I thought you were asleep," he said.\r\n\r\n"I was lying down right enough, but I never closed my eyes."\r\n\r\n"The rest would have done you good after our walk. Didn\'t you try?"\r\n\r\n"I was lying down, I tell you, but sleep I couldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"And you made no sound! What want of sincerity. Or did you want to be\r\nalone for a time?"\r\n\r\n"I--alone?" she murmured.\r\n\r\nHe noticed her eyeing the book, and got up to put it back in the\r\nbookcase. When he turned round, he saw that she had dropped into the\r\nchair--it was the one she always used--and looked as if her strength had\r\nsuddenly gone from her, leaving her only her youth, which seemed very\r\npathetic, very much at his mercy. He moved quickly towards the chair.\r\n\r\n"Tired, are you? It\'s my fault, taking you up so high and keeping you\r\nout so long. Such a windless day, too!"\r\n\r\nShe watched his concern, her pose languid, her eyes raised to him,\r\nbut as unreadable as ever. He avoided looking into them for that very\r\nreason. He forgot himself in the contemplation of those passive arms, of\r\nthese defenceless lips, and--yes, one had to go back to them--of these\r\nwide-open eyes. Something wild in their grey stare made him think of\r\nsea-birds in the cold murkiness of high latitudes. He started when she\r\nspoke, all the charm of physical intimacy revealed suddenly in that\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"You should try to love me!" she said.\r\n\r\nHe made a movement of astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Try," he muttered. "But it seems to me--" He broke off, saying to\r\nhimself that if he loved her, he had never told her so in so many words.\r\nSimple words! They died on his lips. "What makes you say that?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyelids and turned her head a little.\r\n\r\n"I have done nothing," she said in a low voice. "It\'s you who have been\r\ngood, helpful, and tender to me. Perhaps you love me for that--just\r\nfor that; or perhaps you love me for company, and because--well! But\r\nsometimes it seems to me that you can never love me for myself, only\r\nfor myself, as people do love each other when it is to be for ever."\r\nHer head drooped. "Forever," she breathed out again; then, still more\r\nfaintly, she added an entreating: "Do try!"\r\n\r\nThese last words went straight to his heart--the sound of them more than\r\nthe sense. He did not know what to say, either from want of practice in\r\ndealing with women or simply from his innate honesty of thought. All\r\nhis defences were broken now. Life had him fairly by the throat. But he\r\nmanaged a smile, though she was not looking at him; yes, he did manage\r\nit--the well-known Heyst smile of playful courtesy, so familiar to all\r\nsorts and conditions of men in the islands.\r\n\r\n"My dear Lena," he said, "it looks as if you were trying to pick a very\r\nunnecessary quarrel with me--of all people!"\r\n\r\nShe made no movement. With his elbows spread out he was twisting the\r\nends of his long moustaches, very masculine and perplexed, enveloped in\r\nthe atmosphere of femininity as in a cloud, suspecting pitfalls, and as\r\nif afraid to move.\r\n\r\n"I must admit, though," he added, "that there is no one else; and I\r\nsuppose a certain amount of quarrelling is necessary for existence in\r\nthis world."\r\n\r\nThat girl, seated in her chair in graceful quietude, was to him like a\r\nscript in an unknown language, or even more simply mysterious, like\r\nany writing to the illiterate. As far as women went he was altogether\r\nuninstructed and he had not the gift of intuition which is fostered in\r\nthe days of youth by dreams and visions, exercises of the heart fitting\r\nit for the encounters of a world, in which love itself rests as much\r\non antagonism as on attraction. His mental attitude was that of a man\r\nlooking this way and that on a piece of writing which he is unable to\r\ndecipher, but which may be big with some revelation. He didn\'t know what\r\nto say. All he found to add was:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t even understand what I have done or left undone to distress you\r\nlike this."\r\n\r\nHe stopped, struck afresh by the physical and moral sense of the\r\nimperfections of their relations--a sense which made him desire her\r\nconstant nearness, before his eyes, under his hand, and which, when\r\nshe was out of his sight, made her so vague, so elusive and illusory, a\r\npromise that could not be embraced and held.\r\n\r\n"No! I don\'t see clearly what you mean. Is your mind turned towards the\r\nfuture?" he interpellated her with marked playfulness, because he\r\nwas ashamed to let such a word pass his lips. But all his cherished\r\nnegations were falling off him one by one.\r\n\r\n"Because if it is so there is nothing easier than to dismiss it. In our\r\nfuture, as in what people call the other life, there is nothing to be\r\nfrightened of."\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to him; and if nature had formed them to express\r\nanything else but blank candour he would have learned how terrified\r\nshe was by his talk and the fact that her sinking heart loved him more\r\ndesperately than ever. He smiled at her.\r\n\r\n"Dismiss all thought of it," he insisted. "Surely you don\'t suspect\r\nafter what I have heard from you, that I am anxious to return to\r\nmankind. I! I! murder my poor Morrison! It\'s possible that I may be\r\nreally capable of that which they say I have done. The point is that I\r\nhaven\'t done it. But it is an unpleasant subject to me. I ought to be\r\nashamed to confess it--but it is! Let us forget it. There\'s that in you,\r\nLena, which can console me for worse things, for uglier passages. And if\r\nwe forget, there are no voices here to remind us."\r\n\r\nShe had raised her head before he paused.\r\n\r\n"Nothing can break in on us here," he went on and, as if there had been\r\nan appeal or a provocation in her upward glance, he bent down and took\r\nher under the arms, raising her straight out of the chair into a sudden\r\nand close embrace. Her alacrity to respond, which made her seem as light\r\nas a feather, warmed his heart at that moment more than closer caresses\r\nhad done before. He had not expected that ready impulse towards himself\r\nwhich had been dormant in her passive attitude. He had just felt the\r\nclasp of her arms round his neck, when, with a slight exclamation--"He\'s\r\nhere!"--she disengaged herself and bolted, away into her room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\nHeyst was astounded. Looking all round, as if to take the whole room\r\nto witness of this outrage, he became aware of Wang materialized in the\r\ndoorway. The intrusion was as surprising as anything could be, in view\r\nof the strict regularity with which Wang made himself visible. Heyst\r\nwas tempted to laugh at first. This practical comment on his affirmation\r\nthat nothing could break in on them relieved the strain of his feelings.\r\nHe was a little vexed, too. The Chinaman preserved a profound silence.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" asked Heyst sternly.\r\n\r\n"Boat out there," said the Chinaman.\r\n\r\n"Where? What do you mean? Boat adrift in the straits?"\r\n\r\nSome subtle change in Wang\'s bearing suggested his being out of breath;\r\nbut he did not pant, and his voice was steady.\r\n\r\n"No--row."\r\n\r\nIt was Heyst now who was startled and raised his voice.\r\n\r\n"Malay man, eh?"\r\n\r\nWang made a slight negative movement with his head.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear, Lena?" Heyst called out. "Wang says there is a boat in\r\nsight--somewhere near apparently. Where\'s that boat Wang?"\r\n\r\n"Round the point," said Wang, leaping into Malay unexpectedly, and in a\r\nloud voice. "White men three."\r\n\r\n"So close as that?" exclaimed Heyst, moving out on the veranda followed\r\nby Wang. "White men? Impossible!"\r\n\r\nOver the clearing the shadows were already lengthening. The sun\r\nhung low; a ruddy glare lay on the burnt black patch in front of\r\nthe bungalow, and slanted on the ground between the straight, tall,\r\nmast-like trees soaring a hundred feet or more without a branch. The\r\ngrowth of bushes cut off all view of the jetty from the veranda. Far\r\naway to the right Wang\'s hut, or rather its dark roof of mats, could\r\nbe seen above the bamboo fence which insured the privacy of the Alfuro\r\nwoman. The Chinaman looked that way swiftly. Heyst paused, and then\r\nstepped back a pace into the room.\r\n\r\n"White men, Lena, apparently. What are you doing?"\r\n\r\n"I am just bathing my eyes a little," the girl\'s voice said from the\r\ninner room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; all right!"\r\n\r\n"Do you want me?"\r\n\r\n"No. You had better--I am going down to the jetty. Yes, you had better\r\nstay in. What an extraordinary thing!"\r\n\r\nIt was so extraordinary that nobody could possibly appreciate\r\nhow extraordinary it was but himself. His mind was full of mere\r\nexclamations, while his feet were carrying him in the direction of the\r\njetty. He followed the line of the rails, escorted by Wang.\r\n\r\n"Where were you when you first saw the boat?" he asked over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nWang explained in Malay that he had gone to the shore end of the wharf,\r\nto get a few lumps of coal from the big heap, when, happening to raise\r\nhis eyes from the ground, he saw the boat--a white man boat, not a\r\ncanoe. He had good eyes. He had seen the boat, with the men at the oars;\r\nand here Wang made a particular gesture over his eyes, as if his vision\r\nhad received a blow. He had turned at once and run to the house to\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n"No mistake, eh?" said Heyst, moving on. At the very outer edge of the\r\nbelt he stopped short. Wang halted behind him on the path, till the\r\nvoice of Number One called him sharply forward into the open. He obeyed.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s that boat?" asked Heyst forcibly. "I say--where is it?"\r\n\r\nNothing whatever was to be seen between the point and the jetty. The\r\nstretch of Diamond Bay was like a piece of purple shadow, lustrous and\r\nempty, while beyond the land, the open sea lay blue and opaque under the\r\nsun. Heyst\'s eyes swept all over the offing till they met, far off, the\r\ndark cone of the volcano, with its faint plume of smoke broadening and\r\nvanishing everlastingly at the top, without altering its shape in the\r\nglowing transparency of the evening.\r\n\r\n"The fellow has been dreaming," he muttered to himself.\r\n\r\nHe looked hard at the Chinaman. Wang seemed turned into stone. Suddenly,\r\nas if he had received a shock, he started, flung his arm out with a\r\npointing forefinger, and made guttural noises to the effect that there,\r\nthere, there, he had seen a boat.\r\n\r\nIt was very uncanny. Heyst thought of some strange hallucination.\r\nUnlikely enough; but that a boat with three men in it should have sunk\r\nbetween the point and the jetty, suddenly, like a stone, without leaving\r\nas much on the surface as a floating oar, was still more unlikely. The\r\ntheory of a phantom boat would have been more credible than that.\r\n\r\n"Confound it!" he muttered to himself.\r\n\r\nHe was unpleasantly affected by this mystery; but now a simple\r\nexplanation occurred to him. He stepped hastily out on the wharf. The\r\nboat, if it had existed and had retreated, could perhaps be seen from\r\nthe far end of the long jetty.\r\n\r\nNothing was to be seen. Heyst let his eyes roam idly over the sea. He\r\nwas so absorbed in his perplexity that a hollow sound, as of somebody\r\ntumbling about in a boat, with a clatter of oars and spars, failed to\r\nmake him move for a moment. When his mind seized its meaning, he had\r\nno difficulty in locating the sound. It had come from below--under the\r\njetty!\r\n\r\nHe ran back for a dozen yards or so, and then looked over. His sight\r\nplunged straight into the stern-sheets of a big boat, the greater part\r\nof which was hidden from him by the planking of the jetty. His eyes\r\nfell on the thin back of a man doubled up over the tiller in a queer,\r\nuncomfortable attitude of drooping sorrow. Another man, more directly\r\nbelow Heyst, sprawled on his back from gunwale to gunwale, half off\r\nthe after thwart, his head lower than his feet. This second man glared\r\nwildly upward, and struggled to raise himself, but to all appearance was\r\nmuch too drunk to succeed. The visible part of the boat contained also\r\na flat, leather trunk, on which the first man\'s long legs were tucked\r\nup nervelessly. A large earthenware jug, with its wide mouth uncorked,\r\nrolled out on the bottom-boards from under the sprawling man.\r\n\r\nHeyst had never been so much astonished in his life. He stared dumbly at\r\nthe strange boat\'s crew. From the first he was positive that these\r\nmen were not sailors. They wore the white drill-suit of tropical\r\ncivilization; but their apparition in a boat Heyst could not connect\r\nwith anything plausible. The civilization of the tropics could have\r\nhad nothing to do with it. It was more like those myths, current in\r\nPolynesia, of amazing strangers, who arrive at an island, gods or\r\ndemons, bringing good or evil to the innocence of the inhabitants--gifts\r\nof unknown things, words never heard before.\r\n\r\nHeyst noticed a cork helmet floating alongside the boat, evidently\r\nfallen from the head of the man doubled over the tiller, who displayed\r\na dark, bony poll. An oar, too, had been knocked overboard, probably\r\nby the sprawling man, who was still struggling, between the thwarts.\r\nBy this time Heyst regarded the visitation no longer with surprise, but\r\nwith the sustained attention demanded by a difficult problem. With one\r\nfoot poised on the string-piece, and leaning on his raised knee, he\r\nwas taking in everything. The sprawling man rolled off the thwart,\r\ncollapsed, and, most unexpectedly, got on his feet. He swayed dizzily,\r\nspreading his arms out and uttered faintly a hoarse, dreamy "Hallo!" His\r\nupturned face was swollen, red, peeling all over the nose and cheeks.\r\nHis stare was irrational. Heyst perceived stains of dried blood all over\r\nthe front of his dirty white coat, and also on one sleeve.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter? Are you wounded?"\r\n\r\nThe other glanced down, reeled--one of his feet was inside a large pith\r\nhat--and, recovering himself, let out a dismal, grating sound in the\r\nmanner of a grim laugh.\r\n\r\n"Blood--not mine. Thirst\'s the matter. Exhausted\'s the matter. Done up.\r\nDrink, man! Give us water!"\r\n\r\nThirst was in the very tone of his words, alternating a broken croak and\r\na faint, throaty rustle which just reached Heyst\'s ears. The man in the\r\nboat raised his hands to be helped up on the jetty, whispering:\r\n\r\n"I tried. I am too weak. I tumbled down."\r\n\r\nWang was coming along the jetty slowly, with intent, straining eyes.\r\n\r\n"Run back and bring a crowbar here. There\'s one lying by the coal-heap,"\r\nHeyst shouted to him.\r\n\r\nThe man standing in the boat sat down on the thwart behind him. A\r\nhorrible coughing laugh came through his swollen lips.\r\n\r\n"Crowbar? What\'s that for?" he mumbled, and his head dropped on his\r\nchest mournfully.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Heyst, as if he had forgotten the boat, started kicking hard\r\nat a large brass tap projecting above the planks. To accommodate ships\r\nthat came for coal and happened to need water as well, a stream had\r\nbeen tapped in the interior and an iron pipe led along the jetty. It\r\nterminated with a curved end almost exactly where the strangers\' boat\r\nhad been driven between the piles; but the tap was set fast.\r\n\r\n"Hurry up!" Heyst yelled to the Chinaman, who was running with the\r\ncrowbar in his hand.\r\n\r\nHeyst snatched it from him and, obtaining a leverage against the\r\nstring-piece, wrung the stiff tap round with a mighty jerk. "I hope that\r\npipe hasn\'t got choked!" he muttered to himself anxiously.\r\n\r\nIt hadn\'t; but it did not yield a strong gush. The sound of a thin\r\nstream, partly breaking on the gunwale of the boat and partly\r\nsplashing alongside, became at once audible. It was greeted by a cry of\r\ninarticulate and savage joy. Heyst knelt on the string-piece and peered\r\ndown. The man who had spoken was already holding his open mouth under\r\nthe bright trickle. Water ran over his eyelids and over his nose,\r\ngurgled down his throat, flowed over his chin. Then some obstruction in\r\nthe pipe gave way, and a sudden thick jet broke on his face. In a moment\r\nhis shoulders were soaked, the front of his coat inundated; he streamed\r\nand dripped; water ran into his pockets, down his legs, into his shoes;\r\nbut he had clutched the end of the pipe, and, hanging on with both\r\nhands, swallowed, spluttered, choked, snorted with the noises of a\r\nswimmer. Suddenly a curious dull roar reached Heyst\'s ears. Something\r\nhairy and black flew from under the jetty. A dishevelled head, coming on\r\nlike a cannonball, took the man at the pipe in flank, with enough force\r\nto tear his grip loose and fling him headlong into the stern-sheets. He\r\nfell upon the folded legs of the man at the tiller, who, roused by the\r\ncommotion in the boat, was sitting up, silent, rigid, and very much like\r\na corpse. His eyes were but two black patches, and his teeth glistened\r\nwith a death\'s head grin between his retracted lips, no thicker than\r\nblackish parchment glued over the gums.\r\n\r\nFrom him Heyst\'s eyes wandered to the creature who had replaced the\r\nfirst man at the end of the water-pipe. Enormous brown paws clutched it\r\nsavagely; the wild, big head hung back, and in a face covered with a wet\r\nmass of hair there gaped crookedly a wide mouth full of fangs. The water\r\nfilled it, welled up in hoarse coughs, ran down on each side of the jaws\r\nand down the hairy throat, soaked the black pelt of the enormous chest,\r\nnaked under a torn check shirt, heaving convulsively with a play of\r\nmassive muscles carved in red mahogany.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first man had recovered the breath knocked out of him\r\nby the irresistible charge, a scream of mad cursing issued from the\r\nstern-sheets. With a rigid, angular crooking of the elbow, the man at\r\nthe tiller put his hand back to his hip.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t shoot him, sir!" yelled the first man. "Wait! Let me have that\r\ntiller. I will teach him to shove himself in front of a caballero!"\r\n\r\nMartin Ricardo flourished the heavy piece of wood, leaped forward with\r\nastonishing vigour, and brought it down on Pedro\'s head with a crash\r\nthat resounded all over the quiet sweep of Black Diamond Bay. A crimson\r\npatch appeared on the matted hair, red veins appeared in the water\r\nflowing all over his face, and it dripped in rosy drops off his head.\r\nBut the man hung on. Not till a second furious blow descended did the\r\nhairy paws let go their grip and the squirming body sink limply. Before\r\nit could touch the bottom-boards, a tremendous kick in the ribs from\r\nRicardo\'s foot shifted it forward out of sight, whence came the noise of\r\na heavy thud, a clatter of spars, and a pitiful grunt. Ricardo stooped\r\nto look under the jetty.\r\n\r\n"Aha, dog! This will teach you to keep back where you belong, you\r\nmurdering brute, you slaughtering savage, you! You infidel, you robber\r\nof churches! Next time I will rip you open from neck to heel, you\r\ncarrion-eater! Esclavo!"\r\n\r\nHe backed a little and straightened himself up.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean it really," he remarked to Heyst, whose steady eyes met\r\nhis from above. He ran aft briskly.\r\n\r\n"Come along, sir. It\'s your turn. I oughtn\'t to have drunk first. \'S\r\ntruth, I forgot myself! A gentleman like you will overlook that, I\r\nknow." As he made these apologies, Ricardo extended his hand. "Let me\r\nsteady you, sir."\r\n\r\nSlowly Mr. Jones unfolded himself in all his slenderness, rocked,\r\nstaggered, and caught Ricardo\'s shoulder. His henchman assisted him\r\nto the pipe, which went on gushing a clear stream of water, sparkling\r\nexceedingly against the black piles and the gloom under the jetty.\r\n\r\n"Catch hold, sir," Ricardo advised solicitously. "All right?"\r\n\r\nHe stepped back, and, while Mr. Jones revelled in the abundance of\r\nwater, he addressed himself to Heyst with a sort of justificatory\r\nspeech, the tone of which, reflecting his feelings, partook of purring\r\nand spitting. They had been thirty hours tugging at the oars, he\r\nexplained, and they had been more than forty hours without water, except\r\nthat the night before they had licked the dew off the gunwales.\r\n\r\nRicardo did not explain to Heyst how it happened. At that precise moment\r\nhe had no explanation ready for the man on the wharf, who, he guessed,\r\nmust be wondering much more at the presence of his visitors than at\r\ntheir plight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\nThe explanation lay in the two simple facts that the light winds and\r\nstrong currents of the Java Sea had drifted the boat about until they\r\npartly lost their bearings; and that by some extra-ordinary mistake\r\none of the two jars put into the boat by Schomberg\'s man contained salt\r\nwater. Ricardo tried to put some pathos into his tones. Pulling for\r\nthirty hours with eighteen-foot oars! And the sun! Ricardo relieved\r\nhis feelings by cursing the sun. They had felt their hearts and lungs\r\nshrivel within them. And then, as if all that hadn\'t been trouble\r\nenough, he complained bitterly, he had had to waste his fainting\r\nstrength in beating their servant about the head with a stretcher. The\r\nfool had wanted to drink sea water, and wouldn\'t listen to reason.\r\nThere was no stopping him otherwise. It was better to beat him into\r\ninsensibility than to have him go crazy in the boat, and to be obliged\r\nto shoot him. The preventive, administered with enough force to brain\r\nan elephant, boasted Ricardo, had to be applied on two occasions--the\r\nsecond time all but in sight of the jetty.\r\n\r\n"You have seen the beauty," Ricardo went on expansively, hiding his lack\r\nof some sort of probable story under this loquacity. "I had to hammer\r\nhim away from the spout. Opened afresh all the old broken spots on his\r\nhead. You saw how hard I had to hit. He has no restraint, no restraint\r\nat all. If it wasn\'t that he can be made useful in one way or another, I\r\nwould just as soon have let the governor shoot him."\r\n\r\nHe smiled up at Heyst in his peculiar lip-retracting manner, and added\r\nby way of afterthought:\r\n\r\n"That\'s what will happen to him in the end, if he doesn\'t learn to\r\nrestrain himself. But I\'ve taught him to mind his manners for a while,\r\nanyhow!"\r\n\r\nAnd again he addressed his quick grin up to the man on the wharf. His\r\nround eyes had never left Heyst\'s face ever since he began to deliver\r\nhis account of the voyage.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s how he looks!" Ricardo was saying to himself.\r\n\r\nHe had not expected Heyst to be like this. He had formed for himself\r\na conception containing the helpful suggestion of a vulnerable point.\r\nThese solitary men were often tipplers. But no!--this was not a drinking\r\nman\'s face; nor could he detect the weakness of alarm, or even the\r\nweakness of surprise, on these features, in those steady eyes.\r\n\r\n"We were too far gone to climb out," Ricardo went on. "I heard you\r\nwalking along though. I thought I shouted; I tried to. You didn\'t hear\r\nme shout?"\r\n\r\nHeyst made an almost imperceptible negative sign, which the greedy eyes\r\nof Ricardo--greedy for all signs--did not miss.\r\n\r\n"Throat too parched. We didn\'t even care to whisper to each other\r\nlately. Thirst chokes one. We might have died there under this wharf\r\nbefore you found us."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t think where you had gone to." Heyst was heard at last,\r\naddressing directly the newcomers from the sea. "You were seen as soon\r\nas you cleared that point."\r\n\r\n"We were seen, eh?" grunted Mr. Ricardo. "We pulled like\r\nmachines--daren\'t stop. The governor sat at the tiller, but he couldn\'t\r\nspeak to us. She drove in between the piles till she hit something, and\r\nwe all tumbled off the thwarts as if we had been drunk. Drunk--ha,\r\nha! Too dry, by George! We fetched in here with the very last of our\r\nstrength, and no mistake. Another mile would have done for us. When I\r\nheard your footsteps, above, I tried to get up, and I fell down."\r\n\r\n"That was the first sound I heard," said Heyst.\r\n\r\nMr Jones, the front of his soiled white tunic soaked and plastered\r\nagainst his breast-bone, staggered away from the water-pipe. Steadying\r\nhimself on Ricardo\'s shoulder, he drew a long breath, raised his\r\ndripping head, and produced a smile of ghastly amiability, which was\r\nlost upon the thoughtful Heyst. Behind his back the sun, touching the\r\nwater, was like a disc of iron cooled to a dull red glow, ready to start\r\nrolling round the circular steel plate of the sea, which, under the\r\ndarkening sky, looked more solid than the high ridge of Samburan; more\r\nsolid than the point, whose long outlined slope melted into its own\r\nunfathomable shadow blurring the dim sheen on the bay. The forceful\r\nstream from the pipe broke like shattered glass on the boat\'s gunwale.\r\nIts loud, fitful, and persistent splashing revealed the depths of the\r\nworld\'s silence.\r\n\r\n"Great notion, to lead the water out here," pronounced Ricardo\r\nappreciatively.\r\n\r\nWater was life. He felt now as if he could run a mile, scale a ten-foot\r\nwall, sing a song. Only a few minutes ago he was next door to a corpse,\r\ndone up, unable to stand, to lift a hand; unable to groan. A drop of\r\nwater had done that miracle.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you feel life itself running and soaking into you, sir?" he\r\nasked his principal, with deferential but forced vivacity.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Mr. Jones stepped off the thwart and sat down in the\r\nstern-sheets.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that man of yours bleeding to death in the bows under there?"\r\ninquired Heyst.\r\n\r\nRicardo ceased his ecstasies over the life-giving water and answered in\r\na tone of innocence:\r\n\r\n"He? You may call him a man, but his hide is a jolly sight tougher than\r\nthe toughest alligator he ever skinned in the good old days. You don\'t\r\nknow how much he can stand: I do. We have tried him a long time ago.\r\nOla, there! Pedro! Pedro!" he yelled, with a force of lung testifying to\r\nthe regenerative virtues of water.\r\n\r\nA weak "Senor?" came from under the wharf.\r\n\r\n"What did I tell you?" said Ricardo triumphantly. "Nothing can hurt him.\r\nHe\'s all right. But, I say, the boat\'s getting swamped. Can\'t you turn\r\nthis water off before you sink her under us? She\'s half full already."\r\n\r\nAt a sign from Heyst, Wang hammered at the brass tap on the wharf, then\r\nstood behind Number One, crowbar in hand, motionless as before. Ricardo\r\nwas perhaps not so certain of Pedro\'s toughness as he affirmed; for he\r\nstooped, peering under the wharf, then moved forward out of sight. The\r\ngush of water ceasing suddenly, made a silence which became complete\r\nwhen the after-trickle stopped. Afar, the sun was reduced to a red\r\nspark, glowing very low in the breathless immensity of twilight. Purple\r\ngleams lingered on the water all round the boat. The spectral figure in\r\nthe stern-sheets spoke in a languid tone:\r\n\r\n"That--er--companion--er--secretary of mine is a queer chap. I am afraid\r\nwe aren\'t presenting ourselves in a very favourable light."\r\n\r\nHeyst listened. It was the conventional voice of an educated man,\r\nonly strangely lifeless. But more strange yet was this concern for\r\nappearances, expressed, he did not know, whether in jest or in earnest.\r\nEarnestness was hardly to be supposed under the circumstances, and no\r\none had ever jested in such dead tones. It was something which could not\r\nbe answered, and Heyst said nothing. The other went on:\r\n\r\n"Travelling as I do, I find a man of his sort extremely useful. He has\r\nhis little weaknesses, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" Heyst was provoked into speaking. "Weakness of the arm is not\r\none of them; neither is an exaggerated humanity, as far as I can judge."\r\n\r\n"Defects of temper," explained Mr. Jones from the stern-sheets.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this dialogue, coming out just then from under the\r\nwharf into the visible part of the boat, made himself heard in his own\r\ndefence, in a voice full of life, and with nothing languid in his manner\r\non the contrary, it was brisk, almost jocose. He begged pardon for\r\ncontradicting. He was never out of temper with "our Pedro." The\r\nfellow was a Dago of immense strength and of no sense whatever. This\r\ncombination made him dangerous, and he had to be treated accordingly, in\r\na manner which he could understand. Reasoning was beyond him.\r\n\r\n"And so"--Ricardo addressed Heyst with animation--"you mustn\'t be\r\nsurprised if--"\r\n\r\n"I assure you," Heyst interrupted, "that my wonder at your arrival\r\nin your boat here is so great that it leaves no room for minor\r\nastonishments. But hadn\'t you better land?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the talk, sir!" Ricardo began to bustle about the boat, talking\r\nall the time. Finding himself unable to "size up" this man, he was\r\ninclined to credit him with extraordinary powers of penetration, which,\r\nit seemed to him, would be favoured by silence. Also, he feared some\r\npointblank question. He had no ready-made story to tell. He and his\r\npatron had put off considering that rather important detail too\r\nlong. For the last two days, the horrors of thirst, coming on them\r\nunexpectedly, had prevented consultation. They had had to pull for\r\ndear life. But the man on the wharf, were he in league with the devil\r\nhimself, would pay for all their sufferings, thought Ricardo with an\r\nunholy joy.\r\n\r\nMeantime, splashing in the water which covered the bottom-boards,\r\nRicardo congratulated himself aloud on the luggage being out of the way\r\nof the wet. He had piled it up forward. He had roughly tied up Pedro\'s\r\nhead. Pedro had nothing to grumble about. On the contrary, he ought to\r\nbe mighty thankful to him, Ricardo, for being alive at all.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, let me give you a leg up, sir," he said cheerily to\r\nhis motionless principal in the stern-sheets. "All our troubles are\r\nover--for a time, anyhow. Ain\'t it luck to find a white man on this\r\nisland? I would have just as soon expected to meet an angel from\r\nheaven--eh, Mr. Jones? Now then--ready, sir? one, two, three, up you\r\ngo!"\r\n\r\nHelped from below by Ricardo, and from above by the man more unexpected\r\nthan an angel, Mr. Jones scrambled up and stood on the wharf by the side\r\nof Heyst. He swayed like a reed. The night descending on Samburan turned\r\ninto dense shadow the point of land and the wharf itself, and gave a\r\ndark solidity to the unshimmering water extending to the last faint\r\ntrace of light away to the west. Heyst stared at the guests whom the\r\nrenounced world had sent him thus at the end of the day. The only other\r\nvestige of light left on earth lurked in the hollows of the thin man\'s\r\neyes. They gleamed, mobile and languidly evasive. The eyelids fluttered.\r\n\r\n"You are feeling weak," said Heyst.\r\n\r\n"For the moment, a little," confessed the other.\r\n\r\nWith loud panting, Ricardo scrambled on his hands and knees upon the\r\nwharf, energetic and unaided. He rose up at Heyst\'s elbow and stamped\r\nhis foot on the planks, with a sharp, provocative, double beat, such\r\nas is heard sometimes in fencing-schools before the adversaries engage\r\ntheir foils. Not that the renegade seaman Ricardo knew anything of\r\nfencing. What he called "shooting-irons," were his weapons, or the still\r\nless aristocratic knife, such as was even then ingeniously strapped\r\nto his leg. He thought of it, at that moment. A swift stooping motion,\r\nthen, on the recovery, a ripping blow, a shove off the wharf, and no\r\nnoise except a splash in the water that would scarcely disturb the\r\nsilence. Heyst would have no time for a cry. It would be quick and neat,\r\nand immensely in accord with Ricardo\'s humour. But he repressed this\r\ngust of savagery. The job was not such a simple one. This piece had to\r\nbe played to another tune, and in much slower time. He returned to his\r\nnote of talkative simplicity.\r\n\r\n"Ay; and I too don\'t feel as strong as I thought I was when the first\r\ndrink set me up. Great wonder-worker water is! And to get it right here\r\non the spot! It was heaven--hey, sir?"\r\n\r\nMr Jones, being directly addressed, took up his part in the concerted\r\npiece:\r\n\r\n"Really, when I saw a wharf on what might have been an uninhabited\r\nisland, I couldn\'t believe my eyes. I doubted its existence. I thought\r\nit was a delusion till the boat actually drove between the piles, as you\r\nsee her lying now."\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking faintly, in a voice which did not seem to belong\r\nto the earth, his henchman, in extremely loud and terrestrial accents,\r\nwas fussing about their belongings in the boat, addressing himself to\r\nPedro:\r\n\r\n"Come, now--pass up the dunnage there! Move, yourself, hombre, or I\'ll\r\nhave to get down again and give you a tap on those bandages of yours,\r\nyou growling bear, you!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! You didn\'t believe in the reality of the wharf?" Heyst was saying\r\nto Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\n"You ought to kiss my hands!"\r\n\r\nRicardo caught hold of an ancient Gladstone bag and swung it on the\r\nwharf with a thump.\r\n\r\n"Yes! You ought to burn a candle before me as they do before the saints\r\nin your country. No saint has ever done so much for you as I have, you\r\nungrateful vagabond. Now then! Up you get!"\r\n\r\nHelped by the talkative Ricardo, Pedro scrambled up on the wharf, where\r\nhe remained for some time on all fours, swinging to and fro his shaggy\r\nhead tied up in white rags. Then he got up clumsily, like a bulky animal\r\nin the dusk, balancing itself on its hind legs.\r\n\r\nMr Jones began to explain languidly to Heyst that they were in a pretty\r\nbad state that morning, when they caught sight of the smoke of the\r\nvolcano. It nerved them to make an effort for their lives. Soon\r\nafterwards they made out the island.\r\n\r\n"I had just wits enough left in my baked brain to alter the direction\r\nof the boat," the ghostly voice went on. "As to finding assistance,\r\na wharf, a white man--nobody would have dreamed of it. Simply\r\npreposterous!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I thought when my Chinaman came and told me he had seen a\r\nboat with white men pulling up," said Heyst.\r\n\r\n"Most extraordinary luck," interjected Ricardo, standing by anxiously\r\nattentive to every word. "Seems a dream," he added. "A lovely dream!"\r\n\r\nA silence fell on that group of three, as if everyone had become afraid\r\nto speak, in an obscure sense of an impending crisis. Pedro on one side\r\nof them and Wang on the other had the air of watchful spectators. A few\r\nstars had come out pursuing the ebbing twilight. A light draught of air\r\ntepid enough in the thickening twilight after the scorching day, struck\r\na chill into Mr. Jones in his soaked clothes.\r\n\r\n"I may infer, then, that there is a settlement of white people here?" he\r\nmurmured, shivering visibly.\r\n\r\nHeyst roused himself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, abandoned, abandoned. I am alone here--practically alone; but\r\nseveral empty houses are still standing. No lack of accommodation. We\r\nmay just as well--here, Wang, go back to the shore and run the trolley\r\nout here."\r\n\r\nThe last words having been spoken in Malay, he explained courteously\r\nthat he had given directions for the transport of the luggage. Wang had\r\nmelted into the night--in his soundless manner.\r\n\r\n"My word! Rails laid down and all," exclaimed Ricardo softly, in a tone\r\nof admiration. "Well, I never!"\r\n\r\n"We were working a coal-mine here," said the late manager of the\r\nTropical Belt Coal Company. "These are only the ghosts of things that\r\nhave been."\r\n\r\nMr Jones\'s teeth were suddenly started chattering by another faint puff\r\nof wind, a mere sigh from the west, where Venus cast her rays on the\r\ndark edge of the horizon, like a bright lamp hung above the grave of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n"We might be moving on," proposed Heyst. "My Chinaman and\r\nthat--ah--ungrateful servant of yours, with the broken head, can load\r\nthe things and come along after us."\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was accepted without words. Moving towards the shore,\r\nthe three men met the trolley, a mere metallic rustle which whisked past\r\nthem, the shadowy Wang running noiselessly behind. Only the sound of\r\ntheir footsteps accompanied them. It was a long time since so many\r\nfootsteps had rung together on that jetty. Before they stepped on to the\r\npath trodden through the grass, Heyst said:\r\n\r\n"I am prevented from offering you a share of my own quarters." The\r\ndistant courtliness of this beginning arrested the other two suddenly,\r\nas if amazed by some manifest incongruity. "I should regret it more,"\r\nhe went on, "if I were not in a position to give you the choice of those\r\nempty bungalows for a temporary home."\r\n\r\nHe turned round and plunged into the narrow track, the two others\r\nfollowing in single file.\r\n\r\n"Queer start!" Ricardo took the opportunity for whispering, as he fell\r\nbehind Mr. Jones, who swayed in the gloom, enclosed by the stalks of\r\ntropical grass, almost as slender as a stalk of grass himself.\r\n\r\nIn this order they emerged into the open space kept clear of vegetation\r\nby Wang\'s judicious system of periodic firing. The shapes of buildings,\r\nunlighted, high-roofed, looked mysteriously extensive and featureless\r\nagainst the increasing glitter of the stars. Heyst was pleased at\r\nthe absence of light in his bungalow. It looked as uninhabited as\r\nthe others. He continued to lead the way, inclining to the right. His\r\nequable voice was heard:\r\n\r\n"This one would be the best. It was our counting-house. There is some\r\nfurniture in it yet. I am pretty certain that you\'ll find a couple of\r\ncamp bedsteads in one of the rooms."\r\n\r\nThe high-pitched roof of the bungalow towered up very close, eclipsing\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n"Here we are. Three steps. As you see, there\'s a wide veranda. Sorry to\r\nkeep you waiting for a moment; the door is locked, I think."\r\n\r\nHe was heard trying it. Then he leaned against the rail, saying:\r\n\r\n"Wang will get the keys."\r\n\r\nThe others waited, two vague shapes nearly mingled together in the\r\ndarkness of the veranda, from which issued a sudden chattering of Mr.\r\nJones\'s teeth, directly suppressed, and a slight shuffle of Ricardo\'s\r\nfeet. Their guide and host, his back against the rail, seemed to have\r\nforgotten their existence. Suddenly he moved, and murmured:\r\n\r\n"Ah, here\'s the trolley."\r\n\r\nThen he raised his voice in Malay, and was answered, "Ya tuan," from an\r\nindistinct group that could be made out in the direction of the track.\r\n\r\n"I have sent Wang for the key and a light," he said, in a voice\r\nthat came out without any particular direction--a peculiarity which\r\ndisconcerted Ricardo.\r\n\r\nWang did not tarry long on his mission. Very soon from the distant\r\nrecesses of obscurity appeared the swinging lantern he carried. It cast\r\na fugitive ray on the arrested trolley with the uncouth figure of the\r\nwild Pedro drooping over the load; then it moved towards the bungalow\r\nand ascended the stairs. After working at the stiff lock, Wang applied\r\nhis shoulder to the door. It came open with explosive suddenness, as if\r\nin a passion at being thus disturbed after two years\' repose. From the\r\ndark slope of a tall stand-up writing-desk a forgotten, solitary sheet\r\nof paper flew up and settled gracefully on the floor.\r\n\r\nWang and Pedro came and went through the offended door, bringing the\r\nthings off the trolley, one flitting swiftly in and out, the other\r\nstaggering heavily. Later, directed by a few quiet words from Number\r\nOne, Wang made several journeys with the lantern to the store-rooms,\r\nbringing in blankets, provisions in tins, coffee, sugar, and a packet of\r\ncandles. He lighted one, and stuck it on the ledge of the stand-up desk.\r\nMeantime Pedro, being introduced to some kindling-wood and a bundle of\r\ndry sticks, had busied himself outside in lighting a fire, on which he\r\nplaced a ready-filled kettle handed to him by Wang impassively, at arm\'s\r\nlength, as if across a chasm. Having received the thanks of his guests,\r\nHeyst wished them goodnight and withdrew, leaving them to their repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\nHeyst walked away slowly. There was still no light in his bungalow, and\r\nhe thought that perhaps it was just as well. By this time he was much\r\nless perturbed. Wang had preceded him with the lantern, as if in a hurry\r\nto get away from the two white men and their hairy attendant. The light\r\nwas not dancing along any more; it was standing perfectly still by the\r\nsteps of the veranda.\r\n\r\nHeyst, glancing back casually, saw behind him still another light--the\r\nlight of the strangers\' open fire. A black, uncouth form, stooping over\r\nit monstrously, staggered away into the outlying shadows. The kettle had\r\nboiled, probably.\r\n\r\nWith that weird vision of something questionably human impressed upon\r\nhis senses, Heyst moved on a pace or two. What could the people be who\r\nhad such a creature for their familiar attendant? He stopped. The vague\r\napprehension, of a distant future, in which he saw Lena unavoidably\r\nseparated from him by profound and subtle differences; the sceptical\r\ncarelessness which had accompanied every one of his attempts at action,\r\nlike a secret reserve of his soul, fell away from him. He no longer\r\nbelonged to himself. There was a call far more imperious and august. He\r\ncame up to the bungalow, and at the very limit of the lantern\'s light,\r\non the top step, he saw her feet and the bottom part of her dress. The\r\nrest of her person was suggested dimly as high as her waist. She sat\r\non a chair, and the gloom of the low eaves descended upon her head and\r\nshoulders. She didn\'t stir.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t gone to sleep here?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! I was waiting for you--in the dark."\r\n\r\nHeyst, on the top step, leaned against a wooden pillar, after moving the\r\nlantern to one side.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking that it is just as well you had no light. But\r\nwasn\'t it dull for you to sit in the dark?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t need a light to think of you." Her charming voice gave a value\r\nto this banal answer, which had also the merit of truth. Heyst laughed\r\na little, and said that he had had a curious experience. She made no\r\nremark. He tried to figure to himself the outlines of her easy pose.\r\nA spot of dim light here and there hinted at the unfailing grace of\r\nattitude which was one of her natural possessions.\r\n\r\nShe had thought of him, but not in connection with the strangers. She\r\nhad admired him from the first; she had been attracted by his warm\r\nvoice, his gentle eye, but she had felt him too wonderfully difficult to\r\nknow. He had given to life a savour, a movement, a promise mingled with\r\nmenaces, which she had not suspected were to be found in it--or, at any\r\nrate, not by a girl wedded to misery as she was. She said to herself\r\nthat she must not be irritated because he seemed too self-contained, and\r\nas if shut up in a world of his own. When he took her in his arms, she\r\nfelt that his embrace had a great and compelling force, that he was\r\nmoved deeply, and that perhaps he would not get tired of her so very\r\nsoon. She thought that he had opened to her the feelings of delicate\r\njoy, that the very uneasiness he caused her was delicious in its\r\nsadness, and that she would try to hold him as long as she could--till\r\nher fainting arms, her sinking soul, could cling to him no more.\r\n\r\n"Wang\'s not here, of course?" Heyst said suddenly. She answered as if in\r\nher sleep.\r\n\r\n"He put this light down here without stopping, and ran."\r\n\r\n"Ran, did he? H\'m! Well, it\'s considerably later than his usual time\r\nto go home to his Alfuro wife; but to be seen running is a sort of\r\ndegradation for Wang, who has mastered the art of vanishing. Do you\r\nthink he was startled out of his perfection by something?"\r\n\r\n"Why should he be startled?"\r\n\r\nHer voice remained dreamy, a little uncertain.\r\n\r\n"I have been startled," Heyst said.\r\n\r\nShe was not listening to him. The lantern at their feet threw the\r\nshadows of her face upward. Her eyes glistened, as if frightened and\r\nattentive, above a lighted chin and a very white throat.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," mused Heyst, "now that I don\'t see them, I can hardly\r\nbelieve that those fellows exist!"\r\n\r\n"And what about me?" she asked, so swiftly that he made a movement like\r\nsomebody pounced upon from an ambush. "When you don\'t see me, do you\r\nbelieve that I exist?"\r\n\r\n"Exist? Most charmingly! My dear Lena, you don\'t know your own\r\nadvantages. Why, your voice alone would be enough to make you\r\nunforgettable!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t mean forgetting in that way. I dare say if I were to\r\ndie you would remember me right enough. And what good would that be to\r\nanybody? It\'s while I am alive that I want--"\r\n\r\nHeyst stood by her chair, a stalwart figure imperfectly lighted. The\r\nbroad shoulders, the martial face that was like a disguise of his\r\ndisarmed soul, were lost in the gloom above the plane of light in which\r\nhis feet were planted. He suffered from a trouble with which she had\r\nnothing to do. She had no general conception of the conditions of the\r\nexistence he had offered to her. Drawn into its peculiar stagnation she\r\nremained unrelated to it because of her ignorance.\r\n\r\nFor instance, she could never perceive the prodigious improbability of\r\nthe arrival of that boat. She did not seem to be thinking of it. Perhaps\r\nshe had already forgotten the fact herself. And Heyst resolved suddenly\r\nto say nothing more of it. It was not that he shrank from alarming her.\r\nNot feeling anything definite himself he could not imagine a precise\r\neffect being produced on her by any amount of explanation. There is a\r\nquality in events which is apprehended differently by different minds\r\nor even by the same mind at different times. Any man living at all\r\nconsciously knows that embarrassing truth. Heyst was aware that this\r\nvisit could bode nothing pleasant. In his present soured temper\r\ntowards all mankind he looked upon it as a visitation of a particularly\r\noffensive kind.\r\n\r\nHe glanced along the veranda in the direction of the other bungalow. The\r\nfire of sticks in front of it had gone out. No faint glow of embers, not\r\nthe slightest thread of light in that direction, hinted at the presence\r\nof strangers. The darker shapes in the obscurity, the dead silence,\r\nbetrayed nothing of that strange intrusion. The peace of Samburan\r\nasserted itself as on any other night. Everything was as before,\r\nexcept--Heyst became aware of it suddenly--that for a whole minute,\r\nperhaps, with his hand on the back of the girl\'s chair and within a foot\r\nof her person, he had lost the sense of her existence, for the first\r\ntime since he had brought her over to share this invincible, this\r\nundefiled peace. He picked up the lantern, and the act made a silent\r\nstir all along the veranda. A spoke of shadow swung swiftly across her\r\nface, and the strong light rested on the immobility of her features, as\r\nof a woman looking at a vision. Her eyes were still, her lips serious.\r\nHer dress, open at the neck, stirred slightly to her even breathing.\r\n\r\n"We had better go in, Lena," suggested Heyst, very low, as if breaking a\r\nspell cautiously.\r\n\r\nShe rose without a word. Heyst followed her indoors. As they passed\r\nthrough the living-room, he left the lantern burning on the centre\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\nThat night the girl woke up, for the first time in her new experience,\r\nwith the sensation of having been abandoned to her own devices. She woke\r\nup from a painful dream of separation brought about in a way which she\r\ncould not understand, and missed the relief of the waking instant.\r\nThe desolate feeling of being alone persisted. She was really alone.\r\nA night-light made it plain enough, in the dim, mysterious manner of a\r\ndream; but this was reality. It startled her exceedingly.\r\n\r\nIn a moment she was at the curtain that hung in the doorway, and raised\r\nit with a steady hand. The conditions of their life in Samburan would\r\nhave made peeping absurd; nor was such a thing in her character. This\r\nwas not a movement of curiosity, but of downright alarm--the continued\r\ndistress and fear of the dream. The night could not have been very far\r\nadvanced. The light of the lantern was burning strongly, striping the\r\nfloor and walls of the room with thick black bands. She hardly knew\r\nwhether she expected to see Heyst or not; but she saw him at once,\r\nstanding by the table in his sleeping-suit, his back to the doorway.\r\nShe stepped in noiselessly with her bare feet, and let the curtain fall\r\nbehind her. Something characteristic in Heyst\'s attitude made her say,\r\nalmost in a whisper:\r\n\r\n"You are looking for something."\r\n\r\nHe could not have heard her before; but he didn\'t start at the\r\nunexpected whisper. He only pushed the drawer of the table in and,\r\nwithout even looking over his shoulder, asked quietly, accepting her\r\npresence as if he had been aware of all her movements:\r\n\r\n"I say, are you certain that Wang didn\'t go through this room this\r\nevening?"\r\n\r\n"Wang? When?"\r\n\r\n"After leaving the lantern, I mean."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. He ran on. I watched him."\r\n\r\n"Or before, perhaps--while I was with these boat people? Do you know?\r\nCan you tell?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly think so. I came out as the sun went down, and sat outside\r\ntill you came back to me."\r\n\r\n"He could have popped in for an instant through the back veranda."\r\n\r\n"I heard nothing in here," she said. "What is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally you wouldn\'t hear. He can be as quiet as a shadow, when he\r\nlikes. I believe he could steal the pillows from under our heads. He\r\nmight have been here ten minutes ago."\r\n\r\n"What woke you up? Was it a noise?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say that. Generally one can\'t tell, but is it likely, Lena? You\r\nare, I believe, the lighter sleeper of us two. A noise loud enough to\r\nwake me up would have awakened you, too. I tried to be as quiet as I\r\ncould. What roused you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--a dream, perhaps. I woke up crying."\r\n\r\n"What was the dream?"\r\n\r\nHeyst, with one hand resting on the table, had turned in her direction,\r\nhis round, uncovered head set on a fighter\'s muscular neck. She left his\r\nquestion unanswered, as if she had not heard it.\r\n\r\n"What is it you have missed?" she asked in her turn, very grave.\r\n\r\nHer dark hair, drawn smoothly back, was done in two thick tresses for\r\nthe night. Heyst noticed the good form of her brow, the dignity of its\r\nwidth, its unshining whiteness. It was a sculptural forehead. He had a\r\nmoment of acute appreciation intruding upon another order of thoughts.\r\nIt was as if there could be no end of his discoveries about that girl,\r\nat the most incongruous moments.\r\n\r\nShe had on nothing but a hand-woven cotton sarong--one of Heyst\'s few\r\npurchases, years ago, in Celebes, where they are made. He had forgotten\r\nall about it till she came, and then had found it at the bottom of an\r\nold sandalwood trunk dating back to pre-Morrison days. She had quickly\r\nlearned to wind it up under her armpits with a safe twist, as Malay\r\nvillage girls do when going down to bathe in a river. Her shoulders and\r\narms were bare; one of her tresses, hanging forward, looked almost black\r\nagainst the white skin. As she was taller than the average Malay woman,\r\nthe sarong ended a good way above her ankles. She stood poised firmly,\r\nhalf-way between the table and the curtained doorway, the insteps of her\r\nbare feet gleaming like marble on the overshadowed matting of the floor.\r\nThe fall of her lighted shoulders, the strong and fine modelling of\r\nher arms hanging down her sides, her immobility, too, had something\r\nstatuesque, the charm of art tense with life. She was not very\r\nbig--Heyst used to think of her, at first, as "that poor little\r\ngirl,"--but revealed free from the shabby banality of a white platform\r\ndress, in the simple drapery of the sarong, there was that in her form\r\nand in the proportions of her body which suggested a reduction from a\r\nheroic size.\r\n\r\nShe moved forward a step.\r\n\r\n"What is it you have missed?" she asked again.\r\n\r\nHeyst turned his back altogether on the table. The black spokes of\r\ndarkness over the floor and the walls, joining up on the ceiling in a\r\npath of shadow, were like the bars of a cage about them. It was his turn\r\nto ignore a question.\r\n\r\n"You woke up in a fright, you say?" he said.\r\n\r\nShe walked up to him, exotic yet familiar, with her white woman\'s face\r\nand shoulders above the Malay sarong, as if it were an airy disguise,\r\nbut her expression was serious.\r\n\r\n"No," she replied. "It was distress, rather. You see, you weren\'t there,\r\nand I couldn\'t tell why you had gone away from me. A nasty dream--the\r\nfirst I\'ve had, too, since--"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t believe in dreams, do you?" asked Heyst.\r\n\r\n"I once knew a woman who did. Leastwise, she used to tell people what\r\ndreams mean, for a shilling."\r\n\r\n"Would you go now and ask her what this dream means?" inquired Heyst\r\njocularly.\r\n\r\n"She lived in Camberwell. She was a nasty old thing!"\r\n\r\nHeyst laughed a little uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Dreams are madness, my dear. It\'s things that happen in the waking\r\nworld, while one is asleep, that one would be glad to know the meaning\r\nof."\r\n\r\n"You have missed something out of this drawer," she said positively.\r\n\r\n"This or some other. I have looked into every single one of them and\r\ncome back to this again, as people do. It\'s difficult to believe the\r\nevidence of my own senses; but it isn\'t there. Now, Lena, are you sure\r\nthat you didn\'t--"\r\n\r\n"I have touched nothing in the house but what you have given me."\r\n\r\n"Lena!" he cried.\r\n\r\nHe was painfully affected by this disclaimer of a charge which he had\r\nnot made. It was what a servant might have said--an inferior open\r\nto suspicion--or, at any rate, a stranger. He was angry at being so\r\nwretchedly misunderstood; disenchanted at her not being instinctively\r\naware of the place he had secretly given her in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n"After all," he said to himself, "we are strangers to each other."\r\n\r\nAnd then he felt sorry for her. He spoke calmly:\r\n\r\n"I was about to say, are you sure you have no reason to think that the\r\nChinaman has been in this room tonight?"\r\n\r\n"You suspect him?" she asked, knitting her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"There is no one else to suspect. You may call it a certitude."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want to tell me what it is?" she inquired, in the equable\r\ntone in which one takes a fact into account.\r\n\r\nHeyst only smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing very precious, as far as value goes," he replied.\r\n\r\n"I thought it might have been money," she said.\r\n\r\n"Money!" exclaimed Heyst, as if the suggestion had been altogether\r\npreposterous. She was so visibly surprised that he hastened to add: "Of\r\ncourse, there is some money in the house--there, in that writing-desk,\r\nthe drawer on the left. It\'s not locked. You can pull it right out.\r\nThere is a recess, and the board at the back pivots: a very simple\r\nhiding-place, when you know the way to it. I discovered it by accident,\r\nand I keep our store of sovereigns in there. The treasure, my dear, is\r\nnot big enough to require a cavern."\r\n\r\nHe paused, laughed very low, and returned her steady stare.\r\n\r\n"The loose silver, some guilders and dollars, I have always kept in that\r\nunlocked left drawer. I have no doubt Wang knows what there is in it,\r\nbut he isn\'t a thief, and that\'s why I--no, Lena, what I\'ve missed is\r\nnot gold or jewels; and that\'s what makes the fact interesting--which\r\nthe theft of money cannot be."\r\n\r\nShe took a long breath, relieved to hear that it was not money. A great\r\ncuriosity was depicted on her face, but she refrained from pressing him\r\nwith questions. She only gave him one of her deep-gleaming smiles.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t me so it must be Wang. You ought to make him give it back to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHeyst said nothing to that naive and practical suggestion, for the\r\nobject that he missed from the drawer was his revolver.\r\n\r\nIt was a heavy weapon which he had owned for many years and had never\r\nused in his life. Ever since the London furniture had arrived in\r\nSamburan, it had been reposing in the drawer of the table. The real\r\ndangers of life, for him, were not those which could be repelled\r\nby swords or bullets. On the other hand neither his manner nor his\r\nappearance looked sufficiently inoffensive to expose him to light-minded\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nHe could not have explained what had induced him to go to the drawer\r\nin the middle of the night. He had started up suddenly--which was very\r\nunusual with him. He had found himself sitting up and extremely wide\r\nawake all at once, with the girl reposing by his side, lying with her\r\nface away from him, a vague, characteristically feminine form in the dim\r\nlight. She was perfectly still.\r\n\r\nAt that season of the year there were no mosquitoes in Samburan, and the\r\nsides of the mosquito net were looped up. Heyst swung his feet to the\r\nfloor, and found himself standing there, almost before he had become\r\naware of his intention to get up.\r\n\r\nWhy he did this he did not know. He didn\'t wish to wake her up, and\r\nthe slight creak of the broad bedstead had sounded very loud to him. He\r\nturned round apprehensively and waited for her to move, but she did not\r\nstir. While he looked at her, he had a vision of himself lying there\r\ntoo, also fast asleep, and--it occurred to him for the first time in his\r\nlife--very defenceless. This quite novel impression of the dangers of\r\nslumber made him think suddenly of his revolver. He left the bedroom\r\nwith noiseless footsteps. The lightness of the curtain he had to lift\r\nas he passed out, and the outer door, wide open on the blackness of\r\nthe veranda--for the roof eaves came down low, shutting out the\r\nstarlight--gave him a sense of having been dangerously exposed, he could\r\nnot have said to what. He pulled the drawer open. Its emptiness cut his\r\ntrain of self-communion short. He murmured to the assertive fact:\r\n\r\n"Impossible! Somewhere else!"\r\n\r\nHe tried to remember where he had put the thing; but those provoked\r\nwhispers of memory were not encouraging. Foraging in every receptacle\r\nand nook big enough to contain a revolver, he came slowly to the\r\nconclusion that it was not in that room. Neither was it in the other.\r\nThe whole bungalow consisted of the two rooms and a profuse allowance of\r\nveranda all round. Heyst stepped out on the veranda.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Wang, beyond a doubt," he thought, staring into the night. "He has\r\ngot hold of it for some reason."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to prevent that ghostly Chinaman from materializing\r\nsuddenly at the foot of the stairs, or anywhere, at any moment, and\r\ntoppling him over with a dead sure shot. The danger was so irremediable\r\nthat it was not worth worrying about, any more than the general\r\nprecariousness of human life. Heyst speculated on this added risk. How\r\nlong had he been at the mercy of a slender yellow finger on the trigger?\r\nThat is, if that was the fellow\'s reason for purloining the revolver.\r\n\r\n"Shoot and inherit," thought Heyst. "Very simple." Yet there was in his\r\nmind a marked reluctance to regard the domesticated grower of vegetables\r\nin the light of a murderer.\r\n\r\n"No, it wasn\'t that. For Wang could have done it any time this last\r\ntwelve months or more--"\r\n\r\nHeyst\'s mind had worked on the assumption that Wang had possessed\r\nhimself of the revolver during his own absence from Samburan; but at\r\nthat period of his speculation his point of view changed. It struck him\r\nwith the force of manifest certitude that the revolver had been taken\r\nonly late in the day, or on that very night. Wang, of course. But why?\r\nSo there had been no danger in the past. It was all ahead.\r\n\r\n"He has me at his mercy now," thought Heyst, without particular\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment he experienced was curiosity. He forgot himself in it: it\r\nwas as if he were considering somebody else\'s strange predicament. But\r\neven that sort of interest was dying out when, looking to his left, he\r\nsaw the accustomed shapes of the other bungalows looming in the night,\r\nand remembered the arrival of the thirsty company in the boat. Wang\r\nwould hardly risk such a crime in the presence of other white men. It\r\nwas a peculiar instance of the "safety in numbers," principle, which\r\nsomehow was not much to Heyst\'s taste.\r\n\r\nHe went in gloomily, and stood over the empty drawer in deep and\r\nunsatisfactory thought. He had just made up his mind that he must\r\nbreathe nothing of this to the girl, when he heard her voice behind him.\r\nShe had taken him by surprise, but he resisted the impulse to turn round\r\nat once under the impression that she might read his trouble in his\r\nface. Yes, she had taken him by surprise, and for that reason the\r\nconversation which began was not exactly as he would have conducted it\r\nif he had been prepared for her pointblank question. He ought to have\r\nsaid at once: "I\'ve missed nothing." It was a deplorable thing that he\r\nshould have let it come so far as to have her ask what it was he missed.\r\nHe closed the conversation by saying lightly:\r\n\r\n"It\'s an object of very small value. Don\'t worry about it--it isn\'t\r\nworth while. The best you can do is to go and lie down again, Lena."\r\n\r\nReluctant she turned away, and only in the doorway asked: "And you?"\r\n\r\n"I think I shall smoke a cheroot on the veranda. I don\'t feel sleepy for\r\nthe moment."\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t be long."\r\n\r\nHe made no answer. She saw him standing there, very still, with a frown\r\non his brow, and slowly dropped the curtain.\r\n\r\nHeyst did really light a cheroot before going out again on the veranda.\r\nHe glanced up from under the low eaves, to see by the stars how the\r\nnight went on. It was going very slowly. Why it should have irked him he\r\ndid not know, for he had nothing to expect from the dawn; but everything\r\nround him had become unreasonable, unsettled, and vaguely urgent, laying\r\nhim under an obligation, but giving him no line of action. He felt\r\ncontemptuously irritated with the situation. The outer world had broken\r\nupon him; and he did not know what wrong he had done to bring this on\r\nhimself, any more than he knew what he had done to provoke the horrible\r\ncalumny about his treatment of poor Morrison. For he could not forget\r\nthis. It had reached the ears of one who needed to have the most perfect\r\nconfidence in the rectitude of his conduct.\r\n\r\n"And she only half disbelieves it," he thought, with hopeless\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nThis moral stab in the back seemed to have taken some of his strength\r\nfrom him, as a physical wound would have done. He had no desire to do\r\nanything--neither to bring Wang to terms in the matter of the revolver\r\nnor to find out from the strangers who they were, and how their\r\npredicament had come about. He flung his glowing cigar away into the\r\nnight. But Samburan was no longer a solitude wherein he could indulge in\r\nall his moods. The fiery parabolic path the cast-out stump traced in the\r\nair was seen from another veranda at a distance of some twenty yards. It\r\nwas noted as a symptom of importance by an observer with his faculties\r\ngreedy for signs, and in a state of alertness tense enough almost to\r\nhear the grass grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\nThe observer was Martin Ricardo. To him life was not a matter of\r\npassive renunciation, but of a particularly active warfare. He was\r\nnot mistrustful of it, he was not disgusted with it, still less was he\r\ninclined to be suspicious of its disenchantments; but he was vividly\r\naware that it held many possibilities of failure. Though very far from\r\nbeing a pessimist, he was not a man of foolish illusions. He did\r\nnot like failure, not only because of its unpleasant and dangerous\r\nconsequences, but also because of its damaging effect upon his own\r\nappreciation of Martin Ricardo. And this was a special job, of his own\r\ncontriving, and of considerable novelty. It was not, so to speak, in his\r\nusual line of business--except, perhaps, from a moral standpoint, about\r\nwhich he was not likely to trouble his head. For these reasons Martin\r\nRicardo was unable to sleep.\r\n\r\nMr Jones, after repeated shivering fits, and after drinking much hot\r\ntea, had apparently fallen into deep slumber. He had very peremptorily\r\ndiscouraged attempts at conversation on the part of his faithful\r\nfollower. Ricardo listened to his regular breathing. It was all very\r\nwell for the governor. He looked upon it as a sort of sport. A gentleman\r\nnaturally would. But this ticklish and important job had to be pulled\r\noff at all costs, both for honour and for safety. Ricardo rose quietly,\r\nand made his way on the veranda. He could not lie still. He wanted to\r\ngo out for air, and he had a feeling that by the force of his eagerness\r\neven the darkness and the silence could be made to yield something to\r\nhis eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nHe noted the stars, and stepped back again into the dense darkness.\r\nHe resisted the growing impulse to go out and steal towards the other\r\nbungalow. It would have been madness to start prowling in the dark on\r\nunknown ground. And for what end? Unless to relieve the oppression.\r\nImmobility lay on his limbs like a leaden garment. And yet he was\r\nunwilling to give up. He persisted in his objectless vigil. The man of\r\nthe island was keeping quiet.\r\n\r\nIt was at that moment that Ricardo\'s eyes caught the vanishing red\r\ntrail of light made by the cigar--a startling revelation of the man\'s\r\nwakefulness. He could not suppress a low "Hallo!" and began to sidle\r\nalong towards the door, with his shoulders rubbing the wall. For all he\r\nknew, the man might have been out in front by this time, observing the\r\nveranda. As a matter of fact, after flinging away the cheroot, Heyst\r\nhad gone indoors with the feeling of a man who gives up an unprofitable\r\noccupation. But Ricardo fancied he could hear faint footfalls on the\r\nopen ground, and dodged quickly into the room. There he drew breath, and\r\nmeditated for a while. His next step was to feel for the matches on\r\nthe tall desk, and to light the candle. He had to communicate to his\r\ngovernor views and reflections of such importance that it was absolutely\r\nnecessary for him to watch their effect on the very countenance of the\r\nhearer. At first he had thought that these matters could have waited\r\ntill daylight; but Heyst\'s wakefulness, disclosed in that startling way,\r\nmade him feel suddenly certain that there could be no sleep for him that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHe said as much to his governor. When the little dagger-like flame had\r\ndone its best to dispel the darkness, Mr. Jones was to be seen reposing\r\non a camp bedstead, in a distant part of the room. A railway rug\r\nconcealed his spare form up to his very head, which rested on the\r\nother railway rug rolled up for a pillow. Ricardo plumped himself down\r\ncross-legged on the floor, very close to the low bedstead; so that Mr.\r\nJones--who perhaps had not been so very profoundly asleep--on opening\r\nhis eyes found them conveniently levelled at the face of his secretary.\r\n\r\n"Eh? What is it you say? No sleep for you tonight? But why can\'t you let\r\nme sleep? Confound your fussiness!"\r\n\r\n"Because that there fellow can\'t sleep--that\'s why. Dash me if he hasn\'t\r\nbeen doing a think just now! What business has he to think in the middle\r\nof the night?"\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"He was out, sir--up in the middle of the night. My own eyes saw it."\r\n\r\n"But how do you know that he was up to think?" inquired Mr. Jones. "It\r\nmight have been anything--toothache, for instance. And you may have\r\ndreamed it for all I know. Didn\'t you try to sleep?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. I didn\'t even try to go to sleep."\r\n\r\nRicardo informed his patron of his vigil on the veranda, and of the\r\nrevelation which put an end to it. He concluded that a man up with a\r\ncigar in the middle of the night must be doing a think.\r\n\r\nMr Jones raised himself on his elbow. This sign of interest comforted\r\nhis faithful henchman.\r\n\r\n"Seems to me it\'s time we did a little think ourselves," added Ricardo,\r\nwith more assurance. Long as they had been together the moods of his\r\ngovernor were still a source of anxiety to his simple soul.\r\n\r\n"You are always making a fuss," remarked Mr. Jones, in a tolerant tone.\r\n\r\n"Ay, but not for nothing, am I? You can\'t say that, sir. Mine may not be\r\na gentleman\'s way of looking round a thing, but it isn\'t a fool\'s way,\r\neither. You\'ve admitted that much yourself at odd times."\r\n\r\nRicardo was growing warmly argumentative. Mr. Jones interrupted him\r\nwithout heat.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t roused me to talk about yourself, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir." Ricardo remained silent for a minute, with the tip of\r\nhis tongue caught between his teeth. "I don\'t think I could tell you\r\nanything about myself that you don\'t know," he continued. There was a\r\nsort of amused satisfaction in his tone which changed completely as he\r\nwent on. "It\'s that man, over there, that\'s got to be talked over. I\r\ndon\'t like him."\r\n\r\nHe, failed to observe the flicker of a ghastly smile on his governor\'s\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?" murmured Mr. Jones, whose face, as he reclined on his\r\nelbow, was on a level with the top of his follower\'s head.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," said Ricardo emphatically. The candle from the other side of\r\nthe room threw his monstrous black shadow on the wall. "He--I don\'t know\r\nhow to say it--he isn\'t hearty-like."\r\n\r\nMr Jones agreed languidly in his own manner:\r\n\r\n"He seems to be a very self-possessed man."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s it. Self--" Ricardo choked with indignation. "I would soon\r\nlet out some of his self-possession through a hole between his ribs, if\r\nthis weren\'t a special job!"\r\n\r\nMr Jones had been making his own reflections, for he asked:\r\n\r\n"Do you think he is suspicious?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see very well what he can be suspicious of," pondered Ricardo.\r\n"Yet there he was doing a think. And what could be the object of it?\r\nWhat made him get out of his bed in the middle of the night. \'Tain\'t\r\nfleas, surely."\r\n\r\n"Bad conscience, perhaps," suggested Mr. Jones jocularly.\r\n\r\nHis faithful secretary suffered from irritation, and did not see the\r\njoke. In a fretful tone he declared that there was no such thing as\r\nconscience. There was such a thing as funk; but there was nothing to\r\nmake that fellow funky in any special way. He admitted, however, that\r\nthe man might have been uneasy at the arrival of strangers, because of\r\nall that plunder of his put away somewhere.\r\n\r\nRicardo glanced here and there, as if he were afraid of being overheard\r\nby the heavy shadows cast by the dim light all over the room. His\r\npatron, very quiet, spoke in a calm whisper:\r\n\r\n"And perhaps that hotel-keeper has been lying to you about him. He may\r\nbe a very poor devil indeed."\r\n\r\nRicardo shook his head slightly. The Schombergian theory of Heyst had\r\nbecome in him a profound conviction, which he had absorbed as naturally\r\nas a sponge takes up water. His patron\'s doubts were a wanton denying\r\nof what was self-evident; but Ricardo\'s voice remained as before, a soft\r\npurring with a snarling undertone.\r\n\r\n"I am sup-prised at you, sir! It\'s the very way them tame ones--the\r\ncommon \'yporcrits of the world--get on. When it comes to plunder\r\ndrifting under one\'s very nose, there\'s not one of them that would keep\r\nhis hands off. And I don\'t blame them. It\'s the way they do it that sets\r\nmy back up. Just look at the story of how he got rid of that pal of his!\r\nSend a man home to croak of a cold on the chest--that\'s one of your tame\r\ntricks. And d\'you mean to say, sir, that a man that\'s up to it wouldn\'t\r\nbag whatever he could lay his hands in his \'yporcritical way? What was\r\nall that coal business? Tame citizen dodge; \'yporcrisy--nothing else.\r\nNo, no, sir! The thing is to extract it from him as neatly as possible.\r\nThat\'s the job; and it isn\'t so simple as it looks. I reckon you have\r\nlooked at it all round, sir, before you took up the notion of this\r\ntrip."\r\n\r\n"No." Mr. Jones was hardly audible, staring far away from his couch. "I\r\ndidn\'t think about it much. I was bored."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that you were--bad. I was feeling pretty desperate that afternoon,\r\nwhen that bearded softy of a landlord got talking to me about this\r\nfellow here. Quite accidentally, it was. Well, sir, here we are after a\r\nmighty narrow squeak. I feel all limp yet; but never mind--his swag will\r\npay for the lot!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s all alone here," remarked Mr. Jones in a hollow murmur.\r\n\r\n"Ye-es, in a way. Yes, alone enough. Yes, you may say he is."\r\n\r\n"There\'s that Chinaman, though."\r\n\r\n"Ay, there\'s the Chink," assented Ricardo rather absentmindedly.\r\n\r\nHe was debating in his mind the advisability of making a clean breast of\r\nhis knowledge of the girl\'s existence. Finally he concluded he wouldn\'t.\r\nThe enterprise was difficult enough without complicating it with an\r\nupset to the sensibilities of the gentleman with whom he had the honour\r\nof being associated. Let the discovery come of itself, he thought,\r\nand then he could swear that he had known nothing of that offensive\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nHe did not need to lie. He had only to hold his tongue.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he muttered reflectively, "there\'s that Chink, certainly."\r\n\r\nAt bottom, he felt a certain ambiguous respect for his governor\'s\r\nexaggerated dislike of women, as if that horror of feminine presence\r\nwere a sort of depraved morality; but still morality, since he counted\r\nit as an advantage. It prevented many undesirable complications. He did\r\nnot pretend to understand it. He did not even try to investigate\r\nthis idiosyncrasy of his chief. All he knew was that he himself was\r\ndifferently inclined, and that it did not make him any happier or safer.\r\nHe did not know how he would have acted if he had been knocking about\r\nthe world on his own. Luckily he was a subordinate, not a wage-slave but\r\na follower--which was a restraint. Yes! The other sort of disposition\r\nsimplified matters in general; it wasn\'t to be gainsaid. But it was\r\nclear that it could also complicate them--as in this most important and,\r\nin Ricardo\'s view, already sufficiently delicate case. And the worst of\r\nit was that one could not tell exactly in what precise manner it would\r\nact.\r\n\r\nIt was unnatural, he thought somewhat peevishly. How was one to reckon\r\nup the unnatural? There were no rules for that. The faithful henchman\r\nof plain Mr. Jones, foreseeing many difficulties of a material order,\r\ndecided to keep the girl out of the governor\'s knowledge, out of his\r\nsight, too, for as long a time as it could be managed. That, alas,\r\nseemed to be at most a matter of a few hours; whereas Ricardo feared\r\nthat to get the affair properly going would take some days. Once well\r\nstarted, he was not afraid of his gentleman failing him. As is often the\r\ncase with lawless natures, Ricardo\'s faith in any given individual was\r\nof a simple, unquestioning character. For man must have some support in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nCross-legged, his head drooping a little and perfectly still, he might\r\nhave been meditating in a bonze-like attitude upon the sacred syllable\r\n"Om." It was a striking illustration of the untruth of appearances, for\r\nhis contempt for the world was of a severely practical kind. There was\r\nnothing oriental about Ricardo but the amazing quietness of his pose.\r\nMr. Jones was also very quiet. He had let his head sink on the rolled-up\r\nrug, and lay stretched out on his side with his back to the light. In\r\nthat position the shadows gathered in the cavities of his eyes made\r\nthem look perfectly empty. When he spoke, his ghostly voice had only to\r\ntravel a few inches straight into Ricardo\'s left ear.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you say something, now that you\'ve got me awake?"\r\n\r\n"I wonder if you were sleeping as sound as you are trying to make out,\r\nsir," said the unmoved Ricardo.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," repeated Mr. Jones. "At any rate, I was resting quietly!"\r\n\r\n"Come, sir!" Ricardo\'s whisper was alarmed. "You don\'t mean to say\r\nyou\'re going to be bored?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Quite right!" The secretary was very much relieved. "There\'s no\r\noccasion to be, I can tell you, sir," he whispered earnestly. "Anything\r\nbut that! If I didn\'t say anything for a bit, it ain\'t because there\r\nisn\'t plenty to talk about. Ay, more than enough."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with you?" breathed out his patron. "Are you going to\r\nturn pessimist?"\r\n\r\n"Me turn? No, sir! I ain\'t of those that turn. You may call me hard\r\nnames, if you like, but you know very well that I ain\'t a croaker."\r\nRicardo changed his tone. "If I said nothing for a while, it was because\r\nI was meditating over the Chink, sir."\r\n\r\n"You were? Waste of time, my Martin. A Chinaman is unfathomable."\r\n\r\nRicardo admitted that this might be so. Anyhow, a Chink was neither\r\nhere nor there, as a general thing, unfathomable as he might be; but a\r\nSwedish baron wasn\'t--couldn\'t be! The woods were full of such barons.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he is so tame," was Mr. Jones\'s remark, in a\r\nsepulchral undertone.\r\n\r\n"How do you mean, sir? He ain\'t a rabbit, of course. You couldn\'t\r\nhypnotize him, as I saw you do to more than one Dago, and other kinds\r\nof tame citizens, when it came to the point of holding them down to a\r\ngame."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you reckon on that," murmured plain Mr. Jones seriously.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I don\'t, though you have a wonderful power of the eye. It\'s a\r\nfact."\r\n\r\n"I have a wonderful patience," remarked Mr. Jones dryly.\r\n\r\nA dim smile flitted over the lips of the faithful Ricardo who never\r\nraised his head.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to try you too much, sir, but this is like no other job we\r\never turned our minds to."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not. At any rate let us think so."\r\n\r\nA weariness with the monotony of life was reflected in the tone of this\r\nqualified assent. It jarred on the nerves of the sanguine Ricardo.\r\n\r\n"Let us think of the way to go to work," he retorted a little\r\nimpatiently. "He\'s a deep one. Just look at the way he treated that chum\r\nof his. Did you ever hear of anything so low? And the artfulness of the\r\nbeast--the dirty, tame artfulness!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you start moralizing, Martin," said Mr. Jones warningly. "As far\r\nas I can make out the story that German hotel-keeper told you, it seems\r\nto show a certain amount of character;--and independence from common\r\nfeelings which is not usual. It\'s very remarkable, if true."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay! Very remarkable. It\'s mighty low down, all the same," muttered,\r\nRicardo obstinately. "I must say I am glad to think he will be paid off\r\nfor it in a way that\'ll surprise him!"\r\n\r\nThe tip of his tongue appeared lively for an instant, as if trying for\r\nthe taste of that ferocious retribution on his compressed lips. For\r\nRicardo was sincere in his indignation before the elementary principle\r\nof loyalty to a chum violated in cold blood, slowly, in a patient\r\nduplicity of years. There are standards in villainy as in virtue, and\r\nthe act as he pictured it to himself acquired an additional horror\r\nfrom the slow pace of that treachery so atrocious and so tame. But\r\nhe understood too the educated judgement of his governor, a gentleman\r\nlooking on all this with the privileged detachment of a cultivated mind,\r\nof an elevated personality.\r\n\r\n"Ay, he\'s deep--he\'s artful," he mumbled between his sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n"Confound you!" Mr. Jones\'s calm whisper crept into his ear. "Come to\r\nthe point."\r\n\r\nObedient, the secretary shook off his thoughtfulness. There was a\r\nsimilarity of mind between these two--one the outcast of his vices, the\r\nother inspired by a spirit of scornful defiance, the aggressiveness of\r\na beast of prey looking upon all the tame creatures of the earth as its\r\nnatural victim. Both were astute enough, however, and both were aware\r\nthat they had plunged into this adventure without a sufficient scrutiny\r\nof detail. The figure of a lonely man far from all assistance had\r\nloomed up largely, fascinating and defenceless in the middle of the sea,\r\nfilling the whole field of their vision. There had not seemed to be any\r\nneed for thinking. As Schomberg had been saying: "Three to one."\r\n\r\nBut it did not look so simple now in the face of that solitude which was\r\nlike an armour for this man. The feeling voiced by the henchman in his\r\nown way--"We don\'t seem much forwarder now we are here" was acknowledged\r\nby the silence of the patron. It was easy enough to rip a fellow up or\r\ndrill a hole in him, whether he was alone or not, Ricardo reflected in\r\nlow, confidential tones, but--\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t alone," Mr. Jones said faintly, in his attitude of a man\r\ncomposed for sleep. "Don\'t forget that Chinaman." Ricardo started\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ay--the Chink!"\r\n\r\nRicardo had been on the point of confessing about the girl; but no! He\r\nwanted his governor to be unperturbed and steady. Vague thoughts,\r\nwhich he hardly dared to look in the face, were stirring his brain in\r\nconnection with that girl. She couldn\'t be much account, he thought. She\r\ncould be frightened. And there were also other possibilities. The Chink,\r\nhowever, could be considered openly.\r\n\r\n"What I was thinking about it, sir," he went on earnestly, "is\r\nthis--here we\'ve got a man. He\'s nothing. If he won\'t be good, he can be\r\nmade quiet. That\'s easy. But then there\'s his plunder. He doesn\'t carry\r\nit in his pocket."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," breathed Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\n"Same here. It\'s too big, we know, but if he were alone, he would not\r\nfeel worried about it overmuch--I mean the safety of the pieces. He\r\nwould just put the lot into any box or drawer that was handy."\r\n\r\n"Would he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. He would keep it under his eye, as it were. Why not? It is\r\nnatural. A fellow doesn\'t put his swag underground, unless there\'s a\r\nvery good reason for it."\r\n\r\n"A very good reason, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. What do you think a fellow is--a mole?"\r\n\r\nFrom his experience, Ricardo declared that man was not a burrowing\r\nbeast. Even the misers very seldom buried their hoard, unless for\r\nexceptional reasons. In the given situation of a man alone on an island,\r\nthe company of a Chink was a very good reason. Drawers would not be\r\nsafe, nor boxes, either, from a prying, slant-eyed Chink. No, sir,\r\nunless a safe--a proper office safe. But the safe was there in the room.\r\n\r\n"Is there a safe in this room? I didn\'t notice it," whispered Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\nThat was because the thing was painted white, like the walls of the\r\nroom; and besides, it was tucked away in the shadows of a corner. Mr.\r\nJones had been too tired to observe anything on his first coming ashore;\r\nbut Ricardo had very soon spotted the characteristic form. He only\r\nwished he could believe that the plunder of treachery, duplicity, and\r\nall the moral abominations of Heyst had been there. But no; the blamed\r\nthing was open.\r\n\r\n"It might have been there at one time or another," he commented\r\ngloomily, "but it isn\'t there now."\r\n\r\n"The man did not elect to live in this house," remarked Mr. Jones. "And\r\nby the by, what could he have meant by speaking of circumstances which\r\nprevented him lodging us in the other bungalow? You remember what he\r\nsaid, Martin? Sounded cryptic."\r\n\r\nMartin, who remembered and understood the phrase as directly motived by\r\nthe existence of the girl, waited a little before saying:\r\n\r\n"Some of his artfulness, sir; and not the worst of it either. That\r\nmanner of his to us, this asking no questions, is some more of his\r\nartfulness. A man\'s bound to be curious, and he is; yet he goes on as if\r\nhe didn\'t care. He does care--or else what was he doing up with a cigar\r\nin the middle of the night, doing a think? I don\'t like it."\r\n\r\n"He may be outside, observing the light here, and saying the very same\r\nthing to himself of our own wakefulness," gravely suggested Ricardo\'s\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\n"He may be, sir; but this is too important to be talked over in the\r\ndark. And the light is all right, it can be accounted for. There\'s a\r\nlight in this bungalow in the middle of the night because--why, because\r\nyou are not well. Not well, sir--that\'s what\'s the matter, and you will\r\nhave to act up to it."\r\n\r\nThe consideration had suddenly occurred to the faithful henchman, in the\r\nlight of a felicitous expedient to keep his governor and the girl apart\r\nas long as possible. Mr. Jones received the suggestion without the\r\nslightest stir, even in the deep sockets of his eyes, where a steady,\r\nfaint gleam was the only thing telling of life and attention in his\r\nattenuated body. But Ricardo, as soon as he had enunciated his happy\r\nthought, perceived in it other possibilities more to the point and of\r\ngreater practical advantage.\r\n\r\n"With your looks, sir, it will be easy enough," he went on evenly, as\r\nif no silence had intervened, always respectful, but frank, with\r\nperfect simplicity of purpose. "All you\'ve got to do is just to lie down\r\nquietly. I noticed him looking sort of surprised at you on the wharf,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\nAt these words, a naive tribute to the aspect of his physique, even more\r\nsuggestive of the grave than of the sick-bed, a fold appeared on that\r\nside of the governor\'s face which was exposed to the dim light--a deep,\r\nshadowy, semicircular fold from the side of the nose to bottom of the\r\nchin--a silent smile. By a side-glance Ricardo had noted this play of\r\nfeatures. He smiled, too, appreciative, encouraged.\r\n\r\n"And you as hard as nails all the time," he went on. "Hang me if anybody\r\nwould believe you aren\'t sick, if I were to swear myself black in\r\nthe face! Give us a day or two to look into matters and size up that\r\n\'yporcrit."\r\n\r\nRicardo\'s eyes remained fixed on his crossed shins. The chief, in his\r\nlifeless accents, approved.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it would be a good idea."\r\n\r\n"The Chink, he\'s nothing. He can be made quiet any time."\r\n\r\nOne of Ricardo\'s hands, reposing palm upwards on his folded legs, made\r\na swift thrusting gesture, repeated by the enormous darting shadow of an\r\narm very low on the wall. It broke the spell of perfect stillness in\r\nthe room. The secretary eyed moodily the wall from which the shadow had\r\ngone. Anybody could be made quiet, he pointed out. It was not anything\r\nthat the Chink could do; no, it was the effect that his company must\r\nhave produced on the conduct of the doomed man. A man! What was a man? A\r\nSwedish baron could be ripped up, or else holed by a shot, as easily as\r\nany other creature; but that was exactly what was to be avoided, till\r\none knew where he had hidden his plunder.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t think it would be some sort of hole in his bungalow,"\r\nargued Ricardo with real anxiety.\r\n\r\nNo. A house can be burnt--set on fire accidentally, or on purpose, while\r\na man\'s asleep. Under the house--or in some crack, cranny, or crevice?\r\nSomething told him it wasn\'t that. The anguish of mental effort\r\ncontracted Ricardo\'s brow. The skin of his head seemed to move in this\r\ntravail of vain and tormenting suppositions.\r\n\r\n"What did you think a fellow is, sir--a baby?" he said, in answer to Mr.\r\nJones\'s objections. "I am trying to find out what I would do myself. He\r\nwouldn\'t be likely to be cleverer than I am."\r\n\r\n"And what do you know about yourself?"\r\n\r\nMr Jones seemed to watch his follower\'s perplexities with amusement\r\nconcealed in a death-like composure.\r\n\r\nRicardo disregarded the question. The material vision of the spoil\r\nabsorbed all his faculties. A great vision! He seemed to see it. A few\r\nsmall canvas bags tied up with thin cord, their distended rotundity\r\nshowing the inside pressure of the disk-like forms of coins--gold,\r\nsolid, heavy, eminently portable. Perhaps steel cash-boxes with a chased\r\ndesign, on the covers; or perhaps a black and brass box with a handle\r\non the top, and full of goodness knows what. Bank notes? Why not? The\r\nfellow had been going home; so it was surely something worth going home\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n"And he may have put it anywhere outside--anywhere!" cried Ricardo in a\r\ndeadened voice, "in the forest--"\r\n\r\nThat was it! A temporary darkness replaced the dim light of the room.\r\nThe darkness of the forest at night and in it the gleam of a lantern, by\r\nwhich a figure is digging at the foot of a tree-trunk. As likely as not,\r\nanother figure holding that lantern--ha, feminine! The girl!\r\n\r\nThe prudent Ricardo stifled a picturesque and profane exclamation,\r\npartly joy, partly dismay. Had the girl been trusted or mistrusted by\r\nthat man? Whatever it was, it was bound to be wholly! With women there\r\ncould be no half-measures. He could not imagine a fellow half-trusting\r\na woman in that intimate relation to himself, and in those particular\r\ncircumstances of conquest and loneliness where no confidences could\r\nappear dangerous since, apparently, there could be no one she could\r\ngive him away to. Moreover, in nine cases out of ten the woman would be\r\ntrusted. But, trusted or mistrusted, was her presence a favourable or\r\nunfavourable condition of the problem? That was the question!\r\n\r\nThe temptation to consult his chief, to talk over the weighty fact, and\r\nget his opinion on it, was great indeed. Ricardo resisted it; but the\r\nagony of his solitary mental conflict was extremely sharp. A woman in\r\na problem is an incalculable quantity, even if you have something to go\r\nupon in forming your guess. How much more so when you haven\'t even once\r\ncaught sight of her.\r\n\r\nSwift as were his mental processes, he felt that a longer silence was\r\ninadvisable. He hastened to speak:\r\n\r\n"And do you see us, sir, you and I, with a couple of spades having to\r\ntackle this whole confounded island?"\r\n\r\nHe allowed himself a slight movement of the arm. The shadow enlarged it\r\ninto a sweeping gesture.\r\n\r\n"This seems rather discouraging, Martin," murmured the unmoved governor.\r\n\r\n"We mustn\'t be discouraged--that\'s all!" retorted his henchman. "And\r\nafter what we had to go through in that boat too! Why it would be--"\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t find the qualifying words. Very calm, faithful, and yet\r\nastute, he expressed his new-born hopes darkly.\r\n\r\n"Something\'s sure to turn up to give us a hint; only this job can\'t be\r\nrushed. You may depend on me to pick up the least little bit of a hint;\r\nbut you, sir--you\'ve got to play him very gently. For the rest you can\r\ntrust me."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I ask myself what YOU are trusting to."\r\n\r\n"Our luck," said the faithful Ricardo. "Don\'t say a word against that.\r\nIt might spoil the run of it."\r\n\r\n"You are a superstitious beggar. No, I won\'t say anything against it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, sir. Don\'t you even think lightly of it. Luck\'s not to be\r\nplayed with."\r\n\r\n"Yes, luck\'s a delicate thing," assented Mr. Jones in a dreamy whisper.\r\n\r\nA short silence ensued, which Ricardo ended in a discreet and tentative\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Talking of luck, I suppose he could be made to take a hand with\r\nyou, sir--two-handed picket or ekkarty, you being seedy and keeping\r\nindoors--just to pass the time. For all we know, he may be one of them\r\nhot ones once they start--"\r\n\r\n"Is it likely?" came coldly from the principal. "Considering what we\r\nknow of his history--say with his partner."\r\n\r\n"True, sir. He\'s a cold-blooded beast; a cold-blooded, inhuman--"\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll tell you another thing that isn\'t likely. He would not be\r\nlikely to let himself be stripped bare. We haven\'t to do with a young\r\nfool that can be led on by chaff or flattery, and in the end simply\r\noverawed. This is a calculating man."\r\n\r\nRicardo recognized that clearly. What he had in his mind was something\r\non a small scale, just to keep the enemy busy while he, Ricardo, had\r\ntime to nose around a bit.\r\n\r\n"You could even lose a little money to him, sir," he suggested.\r\n\r\n"I could."\r\n\r\nRicardo was thoughtful for a moment.\r\n\r\n"He strikes me, too, as the sort of man to start prancing when one\r\ndidn\'t expect it. What do you think, sir? Is he a man that would prance?\r\nThat is, if something startled him. More likely to prance than to\r\nrun--what?"\r\n\r\nThe answer came at once, because Mr. Jones understood the peculiar idiom\r\nof his faithful follower.\r\n\r\n"Oh, without doubt! Without doubt!"\r\n\r\n"It does me good to hear that you think so. He\'s a prancing beast,\r\nand so we mustn\'t startle him--not till I have located the stuff.\r\nAfterwards--"\r\n\r\nRicardo paused, sinister in the stillness of his pose. Suddenly he\r\ngot up with a swift movement and gazed down at his chief in moody\r\nabstraction. Mr. Jones did not stir.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one thing that\'s worrying me," began Ricardo in a subdued\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Only one?" was the faint comment from the motionless body on the\r\nbedstead.\r\n\r\n"I mean more than all the others put together."\r\n\r\n"That\'s grave news."\r\n\r\n"Ay, grave enough. It\'s this--how do you feel in yourself, sir? Are you\r\nlikely to get bored? I know them fits come on you suddenly; but surely\r\nyou can tell--"\r\n\r\n"Martin, you are an ass."\r\n\r\nThe moody face of the secretary brightened up.\r\n\r\n"Really, sir? Well, I am quite content to be on these terms--I mean as\r\nlong as you don\'t get bored. It wouldn\'t do, sir."\r\n\r\nFor coolness, Ricardo had thrown open his shirt and rolled up his\r\nsleeves. He moved stealthily across the room, bare-footed, towards the\r\ncandle, the shadow of his head and shoulders growing bigger behind him\r\non the opposite wall, to which the face of plain Mr. Jones was turned.\r\nWith a feline movement, Ricardo glanced over his shoulder at the thin\r\nback of the spectre reposing on the bed, and then blew out the candle.\r\n\r\n"In fact, I am rather amused, Martin," Mr. Jones said in the dark.\r\n\r\nHe heard the sound of a slapped thigh and the jubilant exclamation of\r\nhis henchman:\r\n\r\n"Good! That\'s the way to talk, sir!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\nRicardo advanced prudently by short darts from one tree-trunk to\r\nanother, more in the manner of a squirrel than a cat. The sun had\r\nrisen some time before. Already the sparkle of open sea was encroaching\r\nrapidly on the dark, cool, early-morning blue of Diamond Bay; but the\r\ndeep dusk lingered yet under the mighty pillars of the forest, between\r\nwhich the secretary dodged.\r\n\r\nHe was watching Number One\'s bungalow with an animal-like patience, if\r\nwith a very human complexity of purpose. This was the second morning\r\nof such watching. The first one had not been rewarded by success. Well,\r\nstrictly speaking, there was no hurry.\r\n\r\nThe sun, swinging above the ridge all at once, inundated with light the\r\nspace of burnt grass in front of Ricardo and the face of the bungalow,\r\non which his eyes were fixed, leaving only the one dark spot of the\r\ndoorway. To his right, to his left, and behind him, splashes of gold\r\nappeared in the deep shade of the forest, thinning the gloom under the\r\nragged roof of leaves.\r\n\r\nThis was not a very favourable circumstance for Ricardo\'s purpose. He\r\ndid not wish to be detected in his patient occupation. For what he was\r\nwatching for was a sight of the girl--that girl! just a glimpse across\r\nthe burnt patch to see what she was like. He had excellent eyes, and\r\nthe distance was not so great. He would be able to distinguish her face\r\nquite easily if she only came out on the veranda; and she was bound\r\nto do that sooner or later. He was confident that he could form some\r\nopinion about her--which, he felt, was very necessary, before venturing\r\non some steps to get in touch with her behind that Swedish baron\'s back.\r\nHis theoretical view of the girl was such that he was quite prepared,\r\non the strength of that distant examination, to show himself\r\ndiscreetly--perhaps even make a sign. It all depended on his reading of\r\nthe face. She couldn\'t be much. He knew that sort!\r\n\r\nBy protruding his head a little he commanded, through the foliage of a\r\nfestooning creeper, a view of the three bungalows. Irregularly disposed\r\nalong a flat curve, over the veranda rail of the farthermost one hung a\r\ndark rug of a tartan pattern, amazingly conspicuous. Ricardo could see\r\nthe very checks. A brisk fire of sticks was burning on the ground in\r\nfront of the steps, and in the sunlight the thin, fluttering flame had\r\npaled almost to invisibility--a mere rosy stir under a faint wreath of\r\nsmoke. He could see the white bandage on the head of Pedro bending over\r\nit, and the wisps of black hair standing up weirdly. He had wound that\r\nbandage himself, after breaking that shaggy and enormous head. The\r\ncreature balanced it like a load, staggering towards the steps. Ricardo\r\ncould see a small, long-handled saucepan at the end of a great hairy\r\npaw.\r\n\r\nYes, he could see all that there was to be seen, far and near. Excellent\r\neyes! The only thing they could not penetrate was the dark oblong of the\r\ndoorway on the veranda under the low eaves of the bungalow\'s roof. And\r\nthat was vexing. It was an outrage. Ricardo was easily outraged. Surely\r\nshe would come out presently! Why didn\'t she? Surely the fellow did not\r\ntie her up to the bedpost before leaving the house!\r\n\r\nNothing appeared. Ricardo was as still as the leafy cables of creepers\r\ndepending in a convenient curtain from the mighty limb sixty feet above\r\nhis head. His very eyelids were still, and this unblinking watchfulness\r\ngave him the dreamy air of a cat posed on a hearth-rug contemplating the\r\nfire. Was he dreaming? There, in plain sight, he had before him a white,\r\nblouse-like jacket, short blue trousers, a pair of bare yellow calves, a\r\npigtail, long and slender--\r\n\r\n"The confounded Chink!" he muttered, astounded.\r\n\r\nHe was not conscious of having looked away; and yet right there, in the\r\nmiddle of the picture, without having come round the right-hand corner\r\nor the left-hand corner of the house, without falling from the sky or\r\nsurging up from the ground, Wang had become visible, large as life,\r\nand engaged in the young-ladyish occupation of picking flowers. Step\r\nby step, stooping repeatedly over the flower-beds at the foot of the\r\nveranda, the startlingly materialized Chinaman passed off the scene in\r\na very commonplace manner, by going up the steps and disappearing in the\r\ndarkness of the doorway.\r\n\r\nOnly then the yellow eyes of Martin Ricardo lost their intent fixity. He\r\nunderstood that it was time for him to be moving. That bunch of\r\nflowers going into the house in the hand of a Chinaman was for the\r\nbreakfast-table. What else could it be for?\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you flowers!" he muttered threateningly. "You wait!"\r\n\r\nAnother moment, just for a glance towards the Jones bungalow, whence\r\nhe expected Heyst to issue on his way to that breakfast so offensively\r\ndecorated, and Ricardo began his retreat. His impulse, his desire, was\r\nfor a rush into the open, face to face with the appointed victim, for\r\nwhat he called a "ripping up," visualized greedily, and always with\r\nthe swift preliminary stooping movement on his part--the forerunner of\r\ncertain death to his adversary. This was his impulse; and as it was, so\r\nto speak, constitutional, it was extremely difficult to resist when his\r\nblood was up. What could be more trying than to have to skulk and dodge\r\nand restrain oneself, mentally and physically, when one\'s blood was up?\r\nMr. Secretary Ricardo began his retreat from his post of observation\r\nbehind a tree opposite Heyst\'s bungalow, using great care to remain\r\nunseen. His proceedings were made easier by the declivity of the ground,\r\nwhich sloped sharply down to the water\'s edge. There, his feet feeling\r\nthe warmth of the island\'s rocky foundation already heated by the sun,\r\nthrough the thin soles of his straw slippers he was, as it were, sunk\r\nout of sight of the houses. A short scramble of some twenty feet brought\r\nhim up again to the upper level, at the place where the jetty had its\r\nroot in the shore. He leaned his back against one of the lofty uprights\r\nwhich still held up the company\'s signboard above the mound of derelict\r\ncoal. Nobody could have guessed how much his blood was up. To contain\r\nhimself he folded his arms tightly on his breast.\r\n\r\nRicardo was not used to a prolonged effort of self-control. His craft,\r\nhis artfulness, felt themselves always at the mercy of his nature, which\r\nwas truly feral and only held in subjection by the influence of the\r\n"governor," the prestige of a gentleman. It had its cunning too, but it\r\nwas being almost too severely tried since the feral solution of a growl\r\nand a spring was forbidden by the problem. Ricardo dared not venture out\r\non the cleared ground. He dared not.\r\n\r\n"If I meet the beggar," he thought, "I don\'t know what I mayn\'t do. I\r\ndaren\'t trust myself."\r\n\r\nWhat exasperated him just now was his inability to understand\r\nHeyst. Ricardo was human enough to suffer from the discovery of his\r\nlimitations. No, he couldn\'t size Heyst up. He could kill him with\r\nextreme ease--a growl and a spring--but that was forbidden! However, he\r\ncould not remain indefinitely under the funereal blackboard.\r\n\r\n"I must make a move," he thought.\r\n\r\nHe moved on, his head swimming a little with the repressed desire of\r\nviolence, and came out openly in front of the bungalows, as if he had\r\njust been down to the jetty to look at the boat. The sunshine enveloped\r\nhim, very brilliant, very still, very hot. The three buildings faced\r\nhim. The one with the rug on the balustrade was the most distant; next\r\nto it was the empty bungalow; the nearest, with the flower-beds at the\r\nfoot of its veranda, contained that bothersome girl, who had managed\r\nso provokingly to keep herself invisible. That was why Ricardo\'s eyes\r\nlingered on that building. The girl would surely be easier to "size up"\r\nthan Heyst. A sight of her, a mere glimpse, would have been something to\r\ngo by, a step nearer to the goal--the first real move, in fact. Ricardo\r\nsaw no other move. And any time she might appear on that veranda!\r\n\r\nShe did not appear; but, like a concealed magnet, she exercised her\r\nattraction. As he went on, he deviated towards the bungalow. Though his\r\nmovements were deliberate, his feral instincts had such sway that if he\r\nhad met Heyst walking towards him, he would have had to satisfy his\r\nneed of violence. But he saw nobody. Wang was at the back of the house,\r\nkeeping the coffee hot against Number One\'s return for breakfast. Even\r\nthe simian Pedro was out of sight, no doubt crouching on the door-step,\r\nhis red little eyes fastened with animal-like devotion on Mr. Jones, who\r\nwas in discourse with Heyst in the other bungalow--the conversation of\r\nan evil spectre with a disarmed man, watched by an ape.\r\n\r\nHis will having very little to do with it, Ricardo, darting swift\r\nglances in all directions, found himself at the steps of the Heyst\r\nbungalow. Once there, falling under an uncontrollable force of\r\nattraction, he mounted them with a savage and stealthy action of his\r\nlimbs, and paused for a moment under the eaves to listen to the silence.\r\nPresently he advanced over the threshold one leg--it seemed to stretch\r\nitself, like a limb of india-rubber--planted his foot within, brought up\r\nthe other swiftly, and stood inside the room, turning his head from side\r\nto side. To his eyes, brought in there from the dazzling sunshine, all\r\nwas gloom for a moment. His pupils, like a cat\'s, dilating swiftly, he\r\ndistinguished an enormous quantity of books. He was amazed; and he was\r\nput off too. He was vexed in his astonishment. He had meant to note the\r\naspect and nature of things, and hoped to draw some useful inference,\r\nsome hint as to the man. But what guess could one make out of a\r\nmultitude of books? He didn\'t know what to think; and he formulated his\r\nbewilderment in the mental exclamation:\r\n\r\n"What the devil has this fellow been trying to set up here--a school?"\r\n\r\nHe gave a prolonged stare to the portrait of Heyst\'s father, that severe\r\nprofile ignoring the vanities of this earth. His eyes gleamed sideways\r\nat the heavy silver candlesticks--signs of opulence. He prowled as a\r\nstray cat entering a strange place might have done, for if Ricardo had\r\nnot Wang\'s miraculous gift of materializing and vanishing, rather than\r\ncoming and going, he could be nearly as noiseless in his less elusive\r\nmovements. He noted the back door standing just ajar; and all the time\r\nhis slightly pointed ears, at the utmost stretch of watchfulness, kept\r\nin touch with the profound silence outside enveloping the absolute\r\nstillness of the house.\r\n\r\nHe had not been in the room two minutes when it occurred to him that he\r\nmust be alone in the bungalow. The woman, most likely, had sneaked out\r\nand was walking about somewhere in the grounds at the back. She had\r\nbeen probably ordered to keep out of sight. Why? Because the fellow\r\nmistrusted his guests; or was it because he mistrusted her?\r\n\r\nRicardo reflected that from a certain point of view it amounted nearly\r\nto the same thing. He remembered Schomberg\'s story. He felt that\r\nrunning away with somebody only to get clear of that beastly, tame,\r\nhotel-keeper\'s attention was no proof of hopeless infatuation. She could\r\nbe got in touch with.\r\n\r\nHis moustaches stirred. For some time he had been looking at a closed\r\ndoor. He would peep into that other room, and perhaps see something more\r\ninforming than a confounded lot of books. As he crossed over, he thought\r\nrecklessly:\r\n\r\n"If the beggar comes in suddenly, and starts to prance, I\'ll rip him up\r\nand be done with it!"\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on the handle, and felt the door come unlatched. Before\r\nhe pulled it open, he listened again to the silence. He felt it all\r\nabout him, complete, without a flaw.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of prudence had exasperated his self-restraint. A mood\r\nof ferocity woke up in him, and, as always at such times, he became\r\nphysically aware of the sheeted knife strapped to his leg. He pulled at\r\nthe door with fierce curiosity. It came open without a squeak of hinge,\r\nwithout a rustle, with no sound at all; and he found himself glaring at\r\nthe opaque surface of some rough blue stuff, like serge. A curtain was\r\nfitted inside, heavy enough and long enough not to stir.\r\n\r\nA curtain! This unforeseen veil, baffling his curiosity checked his\r\nbrusqueness. He did not fling it aside with an impatient movement; he\r\nonly looked at it closely, as if its texture had to be examined before\r\nhis hand could touch such stuff. In this interval of hesitation, he\r\nseemed to detect a flaw in the perfection of the silence, the faintest\r\npossible rustle, which his ears caught and instantly, in the effort of\r\nconscious listening, lost again. No! Everything was still inside and\r\noutside the house, only he had no longer the sense of being alone there.\r\n\r\nWhen he put out his hand towards the motionless folds it was with\r\nextreme caution, and merely to push the stuff aside a little, advancing\r\nhis head at the same time to peep within. A moment of complete\r\nimmobility ensued. Then, without anything else of him stirring,\r\nRicardo\'s head shrank back on his shoulders, his arm descended slowly to\r\nhis side. There was a woman in there. The very woman! Lighted dimly\r\nby the reflection of the outer glare, she loomed up strangely big and\r\nshadowy at the other end of the long, narrow room. With her back to\r\nthe door, she was doing her hair with bare arms uplifted. One of them\r\ngleamed pearly white; the other detached its perfect form in black\r\nagainst the unshuttered, uncurtained square window-hole. She was there,\r\nher fingers busy with her dark hair, utterly unconscious, exposed and\r\ndefenceless--and tempting.\r\n\r\nRicardo drew back one foot and pressed his elbows close to his sides;\r\nhis chest started heaving convulsively as if he were wrestling or\r\nrunning a race; his body began to sway gently back and forth. The\r\nself-restraint was at an end: his psychology must have its way. The\r\ninstinct for the feral spring could no longer be denied. Ravish or\r\nkill--it was all one to him, as long as by the act he liberated the\r\nsuffering soul of savagery repressed for so long. After a quick glance\r\nover his shoulder, which hunters of big game tell us no lion or tiger\r\nomits to give before charging home, Ricardo charged, head down, straight\r\nat the curtain. The stuff, tossed up violently by his rush, settled\r\nitself with a slow, floating descent into vertical folds, motionless,\r\nwithout a shudder even, in the still, warm air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nThe clock--which once upon a time had measured the hours of philosophic\r\nmeditation--could not have ticked away more than five seconds when Wang\r\nmaterialized within the living-room. His concern primarily was with the\r\ndelayed breakfast, but at once his slanting eyes became immovably fixed\r\nupon the unstirring curtain. For it was behind it that he had located\r\nthe strange, deadened scuffling sounds which filled the empty room. The\r\nslanting eyes of his race could not achieve a round, amazed stare, but\r\nthey remained still, dead still, and his impassive yellow face grew all\r\nat once careworn and lean with the sudden strain of intense, doubtful,\r\nfrightened watchfulness. Contrary impulses swayed his body, rooted to\r\nthe floor-mats. He even went so far as to extend his hand towards the\r\ncurtain. He could not reach it, and he didn\'t make the necessary step\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious struggle was going on with confused thuds of bare feet,\r\nin a mute wrestling match, no human sound, hiss, groan, murmur, or\r\nexclamation coming through the curtain. A chair fell over, not with a\r\ncrash but lightly, as if just grazed, and a faint metallic ring of the\r\ntin bath succeeded. Finally the tense silence, as of two adversaries\r\nlocked in a deadly grip, was ended by the heavy, dull thump of a soft\r\nbody flung against the inner partition of planks. It seemed to shake\r\nthe whole bungalow. By that time, walking backward, his eyes, his\r\nvery throat, strained with fearful excitement, his extended arm still\r\npointing at the curtain, Wang had disappeared through the back door.\r\nOnce out in the compound, he bolted round the end of the house. Emerging\r\ninnocently between the two bungalows he lingered and lounged in the\r\nopen, where anybody issuing from any of the dwellings was bound to see\r\nhim--a self-possessed Chinaman idling there, with nothing but perhaps an\r\nunserved breakfast on his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Wang made up his mind to give up all connection\r\nwith Number One, a man not only disarmed but already half vanquished.\r\nTill that morning he had had doubts as to his course of action, but this\r\noverheard scuffle decided the question. Number One was a doomed man--one\r\nof those beings whom it is unlucky to help. Even as he walked in the\r\nopen with a fine air of unconcern, Wang wondered that no sound of any\r\nsort was to be heard inside the house. For all he knew, the white woman\r\nmight have been scuffling in there with an evil spirit, which had of\r\ncourse killed her. For nothing visible came out of the house he watched\r\nout of the slanting corner of his eye. The sunshine and the silence\r\noutside the bungalow reigned undisturbed.\r\n\r\nBut in the house the silence of the big room would not have struck an\r\nacute ear as perfect. It was troubled by a stir so faint that it could\r\nhardly be called a ghost of whispering from behind the curtain.\r\n\r\nRicardo, feeling his throat with tender care, breathed out admiringly:\r\n\r\n"You have fingers like steel. Jimminy! You have muscles like a giant!"\r\n\r\nLuckily for Lena, Ricardo\'s onset had been so sudden--she was winding\r\nher two heavy tresses round her head--that she had no time to lower her\r\narms. This, which saved them from being pinned to her sides, gave her a\r\nbetter chance to resist. His spring had nearly thrown her down. Luckily,\r\nagain, she was standing so near the wall that, though she was driven\r\nagainst it headlong, yet the shock was not heavy enough to knock all the\r\nbreath out of her body. On the contrary, it helped her first instinctive\r\nattempt to drive her assailant backward.\r\n\r\nAfter the first gasp of a surprise that was really too over-powering for\r\na cry, she was never in doubt of the nature of her danger. She defended\r\nherself in the full, clear knowledge of it, from the force of instinct\r\nwhich is the true source of every great display of energy, and with a\r\ndetermination which could hardly have been expected from a girl who,\r\ncornered in a dim corridor by the red-faced, stammering Schomberg, had\r\ntrembled with shame, disgust, and fear; had drooped, terrified, before\r\nmere words spluttered out odiously by a man who had never in his life\r\nlaid his big paw on her.\r\n\r\nThis new enemy\'s attack was simple, straightforward violence. It was not\r\nthe slimy, underhand plotting to deliver her up like a slave, which\r\nhad sickened her heart and had made her feel in her loneliness that her\r\noppressors were too many for her. She was no longer alone in the world\r\nnow. She resisted without a moment of faltering, because she was no\r\nlonger deprived of moral support; because she was a human being who\r\ncounted; because she was no longer defending herself for herself alone;\r\nbecause of the faith that had been born in her--the faith in the man of\r\nher destiny, and perhaps in the Heaven which had sent him so wonderfully\r\nto cross her path.\r\n\r\nShe had defended herself principally by maintaining a desperate,\r\nmurderous clutch on Ricardo\'s windpipe, till she felt a sudden\r\nrelaxation of the terrific hug in which he stupidly and ineffectually\r\npersisted to hold her. Then with a supreme effort of her arms and of\r\nher suddenly raised knee, she sent him flying against the partition.\r\nThe cedar-wood chest stood in the way, and Ricardo, with a thump which\r\nboomed hollow through the whole bungalow, fell on it in a sitting\r\nposture, half strangled, and exhausted not so much by the efforts as by\r\nthe emotions of the struggle.\r\n\r\nWith the recoil of her exerted strength, she too reeled, staggered back,\r\nand sat on the edge of the bed. Out of breath, but calm and unabashed,\r\nshe busied herself in readjusting under her arms the brown and yellow\r\nfigured Celebes sarong, the tuck of which had come undone during the\r\nfight. Then, folding her bare arms tightly on her breast, she leaned\r\nforward on her crossed legs, determined and without fear.\r\n\r\nRicardo, leaning forward too, his nervous force gone, crestfallen like a\r\nbeast of prey that has missed its spring, met her big grey eyes looking\r\nat him--wide open, observing, mysterious--from under the dark arches of\r\nher courageous eyebrows. Their faces were not a foot apart. He ceased\r\nfeeling about his aching throat and dropped the palms of his hands\r\nheavily on his knees. He was not looking at her bare shoulders, at her\r\nstrong arms; he was looking down at the floor. He had lost one of his\r\nstraw slippers. A chair with a white dress on it had been overturned.\r\nThese, with splashes of water on the floor out of a brusquely misplaced\r\nsponge-bath, were the only traces of the struggle.\r\n\r\nRicardo swallowed twice consciously, as if to make sure of his throat\r\nbefore he spoke again:\r\n\r\n"All right. I never meant to hurt you--though I am no joker when it\r\ncomes to it."\r\n\r\nHe pulled up the leg of his pyjamas to exhibit the strapped knife.\r\nShe glanced at it without moving her head, and murmured with scornful\r\nbitterness:\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes--with that thing stuck in my side. In no other way."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with a shamefaced smile.\r\n\r\n"Listen! I am quiet now. Straight--I am. I don\'t need to explain\r\nwhy--you know how it is. And I can see, now, this wasn\'t the way with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nShe made no sound. Her still, upward gaze had a patient, mournfulness\r\nwhich troubled him like a suggestion of an inconceivable depth. He added\r\nthoughtfully:\r\n\r\n"You are not going to make a noise about this silly try of mine?"\r\n\r\nShe moved her head the least bit.\r\n\r\n"Jee-miny! You are a wonder--" he murmured earnestly, relieved more than\r\nshe could have guessed.\r\n\r\nOf course, if she had attempted to run out, he would have stuck the\r\nknife between her shoulders, to stop her screaming; but all the fat\r\nwould have been in the fire, the business utterly spoiled, and the rage\r\nof the governor--especially when he learned the cause--boundless. A\r\nwoman that does not make a noise after an attempt of that kind has\r\ntacitly condoned the offence. Ricardo had no small vanities. But\r\nclearly, if she would pass it over like this, then he could not be so\r\nutterly repugnant to her. He felt flattered. And she didn\'t seem afraid\r\nof him either. He already felt almost tender towards the girl--that\r\nplucky, fine girl who had not tried to run screaming from him.\r\n\r\n"We shall be friends yet. I don\'t give you up. Don\'t think it. Friends\r\nas friends can be!" he whispered confidently. "Jee-miny! You aren\'t a\r\ntame one. Neither am I. You will find that out before long."\r\n\r\nHe could not know that if she had not run out, it was because that\r\nmorning, under the stress of growing uneasiness at the presence of the\r\nincomprehensible visitors, Heyst had confessed to her that it was his\r\nrevolver he had been looking for in the night; that it was gone, that he\r\nwas a disarmed, defenceless man. She had hardly comprehended the meaning\r\nof his confession. Now she understood better what it meant. The effort\r\nof her self-control, her stillness, impressed Ricardo. Suddenly she\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n"What are you after?"\r\n\r\nHe did not raise his eyes. His hands reposing on his knees, his drooping\r\nhead, something reflective in his pose, suggested the weariness of a\r\nsimple soul, the fatigue of a mental rather than physical contest. He\r\nanswered the direct question by a direct statement, as if he were too\r\ntired to dissemble:\r\n\r\n"After the swag."\r\n\r\nThe word was strange to her. The veiled ardour of her grey gaze from\r\nunder the dark eyebrows never left Ricardo\'s.\r\n\r\n"A swag?" she murmured quietly. "What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Why, swag, plunder--what your gentleman has been pinching right and\r\nleft for years--the pieces. Don\'t you know? This!"\r\n\r\nWithout looking up, he made the motion of counting money into the\r\npalm of his hand. She lowered her eyes slightly to observe this bit\r\nof pantomime, but returned them to his face at once. Then, in a mere\r\nbreath:\r\n\r\n"How do you know anything about him?" she asked, concealing her puzzled\r\nalarm. "What has it got to do with you?"\r\n\r\n"Everything," was Ricardo\'s concise answer, in a low, emphatic whisper.\r\nHe reflected that this girl was really his best hope. Out of the unfaded\r\nimpression of past violence there was growing the sort of sentiment\r\nwhich prevents a man from being indifferent to a woman he has once held\r\nin his arms--if even against her will--and still more so if she has\r\npardoned the outrage. It becomes then a sort of bond. He felt positively\r\nthe need to confide in her--a subtle trait of masculinity, this almost\r\nphysical need of trust which can exist side by side with the most brutal\r\nreadiness of suspicion.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a game of grab--see?" he went on, with a new inflection of\r\nintimacy in his murmur. He was looking straight at her now.\r\n\r\n"That fat, tame slug of a gin-slinger, Schomberg, put us up to it."\r\n\r\nSo strong is the impression of helpless and persecuted misery, that the\r\ngirl who had fought down a savage assault without faltering could not\r\ncompletely repress a shudder at the mere sound of the abhorred name.\r\n\r\nRicardo became more rapid and confidential:\r\n\r\n"He wants to pay him off--pay both of you, at that; so he told me. He\r\nwas hot after you. He would have given all he had into those hands of\r\nyours that have nearly strangled me. But you couldn\'t, eh? Nohow--what?"\r\nHe paused. "So, rather than--you followed a gentleman?"\r\n\r\nHe noticed a slight movement of her head and spoke quickly.\r\n\r\n"Same here--rather than be a wage-slave. Only these foreigners aren\'t to\r\nbe trusted. You\'re too good for him. A man that will rob his best\r\nchum?" She raised her head. He went on, well pleased with his progress,\r\nwhispering hurriedly: "Yes. I know all about him. So you may guess how\r\nhe\'s likely to treat a woman after a bit!"\r\n\r\nHe did not know that he was striking terror into her breast now. Still\r\nthe grey eyes remained fixed on him unmovably watchful, as if sleepy\r\nunder the white forehead. She was beginning to understand. His words\r\nconveyed a definite, dreadful meaning to her mind, which he proceeded to\r\nenlighten further in a convinced murmur.\r\n\r\n"You and I are made to understand each other. Born alike, bred alike, I\r\nguess. You are not tame. Same here! You have been chucked out into this\r\nrotten world of \'yporcrits. Same here!"\r\n\r\nHer stillness, her appalled stillness, wore to him an air of fascinated\r\nattention. He asked abruptly:\r\n\r\n"Where is it?"\r\n\r\nShe made an effort to breathe out:\r\n\r\n"Where\'s what?"\r\n\r\nHis tone expressed excited secrecy.\r\n\r\n"The swag--plunder--pieces. It\'s a game of grab. We must have it; but it\r\nisn\'t easy, and so you will have to lend a hand. Come! is it kept in the\r\nhouse?"\r\n\r\nAs often with women, her wits were sharpened by the very terror of the\r\nglimpsed menace. She shook her head negatively.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Sure?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," she said.\r\n\r\n"Ay! Thought so. Does your gentleman trust you?"\r\n\r\nAgain she shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Blamed \'yporcrit," he said feelingly, and then reflected: "He\'s one of\r\nthe tame ones, ain\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"You had better find out for yourself," she said.\r\n\r\n"You trust me. I don\'t want to die before you and I have made friends."\r\nThis was said with a strange air of feline gallantry. Then, tentatively:\r\n"But he could be brought to trust you, couldn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Trust me?" she said, in a tone which bordered on despair, but which he\r\nmistook for derision.\r\n\r\n"Stand in with us," he urged. "Give the chuck to all this blamed\r\n\'yporcrisy. Perhaps, without being trusted, you have managed to find out\r\nsomething already, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I have," she uttered with lips that seemed to her to be\r\nfreezing fast.\r\n\r\nRicardo now looked at her calm face with something like respect. He was\r\neven a little awed by her stillness, by her economy of words. Womanlike,\r\nshe felt the effect she had produced, the effect of knowing much and of\r\nkeeping all her knowledge in reserve. So far, somehow, this had come,\r\nabout of itself. Thus encouraged, directed in the way of duplicity, the\r\nrefuge of the weak, she made a heroically conscious effort and forced\r\nher stiff, cold lips into a smile.\r\n\r\nDuplicity--the refuge of the weak and the cowardly, but of the disarmed,\r\ntoo! Nothing stood between the enchanted dream of her existence and\r\na cruel catastrophe but her duplicity. It seemed to her that the man\r\nsitting there before her was an unavoidable presence, which had attended\r\nall her life. He was the embodied evil of the world. She was not ashamed\r\nof her duplicity. With a woman\'s frank courage, as soon as she saw\r\nthat opening she threw herself into it without reserve, with only one\r\ndoubt--that of her own strength. She was appalled by the situation; but\r\nalready all her aroused femininity, understanding that whether Heyst\r\nloved her or not she loved him, and feeling that she had brought this on\r\nhis head, faced the danger with a passionate desire to defend her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nTo Ricardo the girl had been so unforeseen that he was unable to bring\r\nupon her the light of his critical faculties. Her smile appeared to him\r\nfull of promise. He had not expected her to be what she was. Who, from\r\nthe talk he had heard, could expect to meet a girl like this? She was\r\na blooming miracle, he said to himself, familiarly, yet with a tinge\r\nof respect. She was no meat for the likes of that tame, respectable\r\ngin-slinger. Ricardo grew hot with indignation. Her courage, her\r\nphysical strength, demonstrated at the cost of his discomfiture,\r\ncommanded his sympathy. He felt himself drawn to her by the proofs\r\nof her amazing spirit. Such a girl! She had a strong soul; and her\r\nreflective disposition to throw over her connection proved that she was\r\nno hypocrite.\r\n\r\n"Is your gentleman a good shot?" he said, looking down on the floor\r\nagain, as if indifferent.\r\n\r\nShe hardly understood the phrase; but in its form it suggested some\r\naccomplishment. It was safe to whisper an affirmative.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Mine, too--and better than good," Ricardo murmured, and then, in a\r\nconfidential burst: "I am not so good at it, but I carry a pretty deadly\r\nthing about me, all the same!"\r\n\r\nHe tapped his leg. She was past the stage of shudders now. Stiff all\r\nover, unable even to move her eyes, she felt an awful mental tension\r\nwhich was like blank forgetfulness. Ricardo tried to influence her in\r\nhis own way.\r\n\r\n"And my gentleman is not the sort that would drop me. He ain\'t no\r\nforeigner; whereas you, with your baron, you don\'t know what\'s before\r\nyou--or, rather, being a woman, you know only too well. Much better\r\nnot to wait for the chuck. Pile in with us and get your share--of the\r\nplunder, I mean. You have some notion about it already."\r\n\r\nShe felt that if she as much as hinted by word or sign that there was no\r\nsuch thing on the island, Heyst\'s life wouldn\'t be worth half an hour\'s\r\npurchase; but all power of combining words had vanished in the tension\r\nof her mind. Words themselves were too difficult to think of--all except\r\nthe word "yes," the saving word! She whispered it with not a feature of\r\nher face moving. To Ricardo the faint and concise sound proved a cool,\r\nreserved assent, more worth having from that amazing mistress of herself\r\nthan a thousand words from any other woman. He thought with exultation\r\nthat he had come upon one in a million--in ten millions! His whisper\r\nbecame frankly entreating.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good! Now all you\'ve got to do is to make sure where he keeps\r\nhis swag. Only do be quick about it! I can\'t stand much longer this\r\ncrawling-on-the-stomach business so as not to scare your gentleman. What\r\ndo you think a fellow is--a reptile?"\r\n\r\nShe stared without seeing anyone, as a person in the night sits staring\r\nand listening to deadly sounds, to evil incantations. And always in her\r\nhead there was that tension of the mind trying to get hold of something,\r\nof a saving idea which seemed to be so near and could not be captured.\r\nSuddenly she seized it. Yes--she had to get that man out of the\r\nhouse. At that very moment, raised outside, not very near, but heard\r\ndistinctly, Heyst\'s voice uttered the words:\r\n\r\n"Have you been looking out for me, Wang?"\r\n\r\nIt was for her like a flash of lightning framed in the darkness which\r\nhad beset her on all sides, showing a deadly precipice right under her\r\nfeet. With a convulsive movement she sat up straight, but had no power\r\nto rise. Ricardo, on the contrary, was on his feet on the instant, as\r\nnoiseless as a cat. His yellow eyes gleamed, gliding here and there;\r\nbut he too seemed unable to make another movement. Only his moustaches\r\nstirred visibly, like the feelers of some animal.\r\n\r\nWang\'s answer, "Ya tuan," was heard by the two in the room, but more\r\nfaintly. Then Heyst again:\r\n\r\n"All right! You may bring the coffee in. Mem Putih out in the room yet?"\r\n\r\nTo this question Wang made no answer.\r\n\r\nRicardo\'s and the girl\'s eyes met, utterly without expression, all their\r\nfaculties being absorbed in listening for the first sound of Heyst\'s\r\nfootsteps, for any sound outside which would mean that Ricardo\'s retreat\r\nwas cut off. Both understood perfectly well that Wang must have gone\r\nround the house, and that he was now at the back, making it impossible\r\nfor Ricardo to slip out unseen that way before Heyst came in at the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nA darkling shade settled on the face of the devoted secretary. Here was\r\nthe business utterly spoiled! It was the gloom of anger, and even of\r\napprehension. He would perhaps have made a dash for it through the back\r\ndoor, if Heyst had not been heard ascending the front steps. He climbed\r\nthem slowly, very slowly, like a man who is discouraged or weary--or\r\nsimply thoughtful; and Ricardo had a mental vision of his face, with its\r\nmartial moustache, the lofty forehead, the impassive features, and the\r\nquiet, meditative eyes. Trapped! Confound it! After all, perhaps the\r\ngovernor was right. Women had to be shunned. Fooling with this one had\r\napparently ruined the whole business. For, trapped as he was he might\r\njust as well kill, since, anyhow, to be seen was to be unmasked. But he\r\nwas too fair-minded to be angry with the girl.\r\n\r\nHeyst had paused on the veranda, or in the very doorway.\r\n\r\n"I shall be shot down like a dog if I ain\'t quick," Ricardo muttered\r\nexcitedly to the girl.\r\n\r\nHe stooped to get hold of his knife; and the next moment would have\r\nhurled himself out through the curtain, nearly, as prompt and fully as\r\ndeadly to Heyst as an unexpected thunderbolt. The feel more than the\r\nstrength of the girl\'s hand, clutching at his shoulder, checked him. He\r\nswung round, crouching with a yellow upward glare. Ah! Was she turning\r\nagainst him?\r\n\r\nHe would have stuck his knife into the hollow of her bare throat if\r\nhe had not seen her other hand pointing to the window. It was a long\r\nopening, high up, close under the ceiling almost, with a single pivoting\r\nshutter.\r\n\r\nWhile he was still looking at it she moved noiselessly away, picking\r\nup the overturned chair, and placed it under the wall. Then she looked\r\nround; but he didn\'t need to be beckoned to. In two long, tiptoeing\r\nstrides he was at her side.\r\n\r\n"Be quick!" she gasped.\r\n\r\nHe seized her hand and wrung it with all the force of his dumb\r\ngratitude, as a man does to a chum when there is no time for words. Then\r\nhe mounted the chair. Ricardo was short--too short to get over without a\r\nnoisy scramble. He hesitated an instant; she, watchful, bore rigidly on\r\nthe seat with her beautiful bare arms, while, light and sure, he used\r\nthe back of the chair as a ladder. The masses of her brown hair fell all\r\nabout her face.\r\n\r\nFootsteps resounded in the next room, and Heyst\'s voice, not very loud,\r\ncalled her by name.\r\n\r\n"Lena!"\r\n\r\n"Yes! In a minute," she answered with a particular intonation which she\r\nknew would prevent Heyst from coming in at once.\r\n\r\nWhen she looked up, Ricardo had vanished, letting himself down outside\r\nso lightly that she had not heard the slightest noise. She stood up\r\nthen, bewildered, frightened, as if awakened from a drugged sleep, with\r\nheavy, downcast, unseeing eyes, her fortitude tired out, her imagination\r\nas if dead within her and unable to keep her fear alive.\r\n\r\nHeyst moved about aimlessly in the other room. This sound roused her\r\nexhausted wits. At once she began to think, hear, see; and what she\r\nsaw--or rather recognized, for her eyes had been resting on it all the\r\ntime--was Ricardo\'s straw slipper, lost in the scuffle, lying near the\r\nbath. She had just time to step forward and plant her foot on it when\r\nthe curtains shook, and, pushed aside, disclosed Heyst in the doorway.\r\n\r\nOut of the appeased enchantment of the senses she had found with him,\r\nlike a sort of bewitched state, his danger brought a sensation of warmth\r\nto her breast. She felt something stir in there, something profound,\r\nlike a new sort of life.\r\n\r\nThe room was in partial darkness, Ricardo having accidentally swung\r\nthe pivoted shutter as he went out of the window. Heyst peered from the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n"Why, you haven\'t done your hair yet," he said.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t stop to do it now. I shan\'t be long," she replied steadily, and\r\nremained still, feeling Ricardo\'s slipper under the sole of her foot.\r\n\r\nHeyst, with a movement of retreat, let the curtain drop slowly. On the\r\ninstant she stooped for the slipper, and, with it in her hand, spun\r\nround wildly, looking for some hiding-place; but there was no such spot\r\nin the bare room. The chest, the leather bunk, a dress or two of hers\r\nhanging on pegs--there was no place where the merest hazard might not\r\nguide Heyst\'s hand at any moment. Her wildly roaming eyes were caught\r\nby the half-closed window. She ran to it, and by raising herself on her\r\ntoes was able to reach the shutter with her fingertips. She pushed it\r\nsquare, stole back to the middle of the room, and, turning about, swung\r\nher arm, regulating the force of the throw so as not to let the slipper\r\nfly too far out and hit the edge of the overhanging eaves. It was a\r\ntask of the nicest judgement for the muscles of those round arms, still\r\nquivering from the deadly wrestle with a man, for that brain, tense with\r\nthe excitement of the situation and for the unstrung nerves flickering\r\ndarkness before her eyes. At last the slipper left her hand. As soon as\r\nit passed the opening, it was out of her sight. She listened. She did\r\nnot hear it strike anything; it just vanished, as if it had wings to fly\r\non through the air. Not a sound! It had gone clear.\r\n\r\nHer valiant arms hanging close against her side, she stood as if turned\r\ninto stone. A faint whistle reached her ears. The forgetful Ricardo,\r\nbecoming very much aware of his loss, had been hanging about in great\r\nanxiety, which was relieved by the appearance of the slipper flying from\r\nunder the eaves; and now, thoughtfully, he had ventured a whistle to put\r\nher mind at ease.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the girl reeled forward. She saved herself from a fall only by\r\nembracing with both arms one of the tall, roughly carved posts holding\r\nthe mosquito net above the bed. For a long time she clung to it, with\r\nher forehead leaning against the wood. One side of her loosened sarong\r\nhad slipped down as low as her hip. The long brown tresses of her hair\r\nfell in lank wisps, as if wet, almost black against her white body. Her\r\nuncovered flank, damp with the sweat of anguish and fatigue, gleamed\r\ncoldly with the immobility of polished marble in the hot, diffused\r\nlight falling through the window above her head--a dim reflection of the\r\nconsuming, passionate blaze of sunshine outside, all aquiver with the\r\neffort to set the earth on fire, to burn it to ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nHeyst, seated at the table with his chin on his breast, raised his head\r\nat the faint rustle of Lena\'s dress. He was startled by the dead pallor\r\nof her cheeks, by something lifeless in her eyes, which looked at\r\nhim strangely, without recognition. But to his anxious inquiries she\r\nanswered reassuringly that there was nothing the matter with her,\r\nreally. She had felt giddy on rising. She had even had a moment of\r\nfaintness, after her bath. She had to sit down to wait for it to pass.\r\nThis had made her late dressing.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t try to do my hair. I didn\'t want to keep you waiting any\r\nlonger," she said.\r\n\r\nHe was unwilling to press her with questions about her health, since she\r\nseemed to make light of this indisposition. She had not done her hair,\r\nbut she had brushed it, and had tied it with a ribbon behind. With her\r\nforehead uncovered, she looked very young, almost a child, a careworn\r\nchild; a child with something on its mind.\r\n\r\nWhat surprised Heyst was the non-appearance of Wang. The Chinaman had\r\nalways materialized at the precise moment of his service, neither too\r\nsoon nor too late. This time the usual miracle failed. What was the\r\nmeaning of this?\r\n\r\nHeyst raised his voice--a thing he disliked doing. It was promptly\r\nanswered from the compound:\r\n\r\n"Ada tuan!"\r\n\r\nLena, leaning on her elbow, with her eyes on her plate, did not seem to\r\nhear anything. When Wang entered with a tray, his narrow eyes, tilted\r\ninward by the prominence of salient cheek-bones, kept her under stealthy\r\nobservation all the time. Neither the one nor the other of that white\r\ncouple paid the slightest attention to him and he withdrew without\r\nhaving heard them exchange a single word. He squatted on his heels on\r\nthe back veranda. His Chinaman\'s mind, very clear but not far-reaching,\r\nwas made up according to the plain reason of things, such as it appeared\r\nto him in the light of his simple feeling for self-preservation,\r\nuntrammelled by any notions of romantic honour or tender conscience. His\r\nyellow hands, lightly clasped, hung idly between his knees. The graves\r\nof Wang\'s ancestors were far away, his parents were dead, his elder\r\nbrother was a soldier in the yamen of some Mandarin away in Formosa. No\r\none near by had a claim on his veneration or his obedience. He had been\r\nfor years a labouring restless vagabond. His only tie in the world\r\nwas the Alfuro woman, in exchange for whom he had given away some\r\nconsiderable part of his hard-earned substance; and his duty, in reason,\r\ncould be to no one but himself.\r\n\r\nThe scuffle behind the curtain was a thing of bad augury for that Number\r\nOne for whom the Chinaman had neither love nor dislike. He had been awed\r\nenough by that development to hang back with the coffee-pot till at last\r\nthe white man was induced to call him in. Wang went in with curiosity.\r\nCertainly, the white woman looked as if she had been wrestling with\r\na spirit which had managed to tear half her blood out of her before\r\nletting her go. As to the man, Wang had long looked upon him as being in\r\nsome sort bewitched; and now he was doomed. He heard their voices in\r\nthe room. Heyst was urging the girl to go and lie down again. He was\r\nextremely concerned. She had eaten nothing.\r\n\r\n"The best thing for you. You really must!"\r\n\r\nShe sat listless, shaking her head from time to time negatively, as if\r\nnothing could be any good. But he insisted; she saw the beginning of\r\nwonder in his eyes, and suddenly gave way.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I had better."\r\n\r\nShe did not want to arouse his wonder, which would lead him straight to\r\nsuspicion. He must not suspect!\r\n\r\nAlready, with the consciousness of her love for this man, of that\r\nsomething rapturous and profound going beyond the mere embrace, there\r\nwas born in her a woman\'s innate mistrust of masculinity, of that\r\nseductive strength allied to an absurd, delicate shrinking from the\r\nrecognition of the naked necessity of facts, which never yet frightened\r\na woman worthy of the name. She had no plan; but her mind, quieted down\r\nsomewhat by the very effort to preserve outward composure for his sake,\r\nperceived that her behaviour had secured, at any rate, a short period of\r\nsafety. Perhaps because of the similarity of their miserable origin in\r\nthe dregs of mankind, she had understood Ricardo perfectly. He would\r\nkeep quiet for a time now. In this momentarily soothing certitude her\r\nbodily fatigue asserted itself, the more overpoweringly since its cause\r\nwas not so much the demand on her strength as the awful suddenness of\r\nthe stress she had had to meet. She would have tried to overcome it\r\nfrom the mere instinct of resistance, if it had not been for Heyst\'s\r\nalternate pleadings and commands. Before this eminently masculine\r\nfussing she felt the woman\'s need to give way, the sweetness of\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\n"I will do anything you like," she said.\r\n\r\nGetting up, she was surprised by a wave of languid weakness that came\r\nover her, embracing and enveloping her like warm water, with a noise in\r\nher ears as of a breaking sea.\r\n\r\n"You must help me along," she added quickly.\r\n\r\nWhile he put his arm round her waist--not by any means an uncommon thing\r\nfor him to do--she found a special satisfaction in the feeling of being\r\nthus sustained. She abandoned all her weight to that encircling and\r\nprotecting pressure, while a thrill went through her at the sudden\r\nthought that it was she who would have to protect him, to be the\r\ndefender of a man who was strong enough to lift her bodily, as he was\r\ndoing even then in his two arms. For Heyst had done this as soon as they\r\nhad crept through the doorway of the room. He thought it was quicker\r\nand simpler to carry her the last step or two. He had grown really too\r\nanxious to be aware of the effort. He lifted her high and deposited her\r\non the bed, as one lays a child on its side in a cot. Then he sat down\r\non the edge, masking his concern with a smile which obtained no response\r\nfrom the dreamy immobility of her eyes. But she sought his hand, seized\r\nit eagerly; and while she was pressing it with all the force of\r\nwhich she was capable, the sleep she needed overtook her suddenly,\r\noverwhelmingly, as it overtakes a child in a cot, with her lips parted\r\nfor a safe, endearing word which she had thought of but had no time to\r\nutter.\r\n\r\nThe usual flaming silence brooded over Samburan.\r\n\r\n"What in the world is this new mystery?" murmured Heyst to himself,\r\ncontemplating her deep slumber.\r\n\r\nIt was so deep, this enchanted sleep, that when some time afterwards he\r\ngently tried to open her fingers and free his hand, he succeeded without\r\nprovoking the slightest stir.\r\n\r\n"There is some very simple explanation, no doubt," he thought, as he\r\nstole out into the living-room.\r\n\r\nAbsent-mindedly he pulled a book out of the top shelf, and sat down with\r\nit; but even after he had opened it on his knee, and had been staring\r\nat the pages for a time, he had not the slightest idea of what it was\r\nabout. He stared and stared at the crowded, parallel lines. It was only\r\nwhen, raising his eyes for no particular reason, he saw Wang standing\r\nmotionless on the other side of the table, that he regained complete\r\ncontrol of his faculties.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," he said, as if suddenly reminded of a forgotten appointment\r\nof a not particularly welcome sort.\r\n\r\nHe waited a little, and then, with reluctant curiosity, forced himself\r\nto ask the silent Wang what he had to say. He had some idea that the\r\nmatter of the vanished revolver would come up at last; but the guttural\r\nsounds which proceeded from the Chinaman did not refer to that delicate\r\nsubject. His speech was concerned with cups, saucers, plates, forks, and\r\nknives. All these things had been put away in the cupboards on the\r\nback veranda, where they belonged, perfectly clean, "all plopel." Heyst\r\nwondered at the scrupulosity of a man who was about to abandon him;\r\nfor he was not surprised to hear Wang conclude the account of his\r\nstewardship with the words:\r\n\r\n"I go now."\r\n\r\n"Oh! You go now?" said Heyst, leaning back, his book on his knees.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Me no likee. One man, two man, three man--no can do! Me go now."\r\n\r\n"What\'s frightening you away like this?" asked Heyst, while through his\r\nmind flashed the hope that something enlightening might come from that\r\nbeing so unlike himself, taking contact with the world with a simplicity\r\nand directness of which his own mind was not capable. "Why?" he went on.\r\n"You are used to white men. You know them well."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Me savee them," assented Wang inscrutably. "Me savee plenty."\r\n\r\nAll that he really knew was his own mind. He had made it up to withdraw\r\nhimself and the Alfuro woman from the uncertainties of the relations\r\nwhich were going to establish themselves between those white men. It\r\nwas Pedro who had been the first cause of Wang\'s suspicion and fear. The\r\nChinaman had seen wild men. He had penetrated, in the train of a Chinese\r\npedlar, up one or two of the Bornean rivers into the country of the\r\nDyaks. He had also been in the interior of Mindanao, where there are\r\npeople who live in trees--savages, no better than animals; but a\r\nhairy brute like Pedro, with his great fangs and ferocious growls, was\r\naltogether beyond his conception of anything that could be looked upon\r\nas human. The strong impression made on him by Pedro was the prime\r\ninducement which had led Wang to purloin the revolver. Reflection on\r\nthe general situation, and on the insecurity of Number One, came later,\r\nafter he had obtained possession of the revolver and of the box of\r\ncartridges out of the table drawer in the living-room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you savee plenty about white men," Heyst went on in a slightly\r\nbantering tone, after a moment of silent reflection in which he had\r\nconfessed to himself that the recovery of the revolver was not to be\r\nthought of, either by persuasion or by some more forcible means. "You\r\nspeak in that fashion, but you are frightened of those white men over\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Me no flightened," protested Wang raucously, throwing up his\r\nhead--which gave to his throat a more strained, anxious appearance than\r\never. "Me no likee," he added in a quieter tone. "Me velly sick."\r\n\r\nHe put his hand over the region under the breast-bone.\r\n\r\n"That," said Heyst, serenely positive, "belong one piecee lie. That\r\nisn\'t proper man-talk at all. And after stealing my revolver, too!"\r\n\r\nHe had suddenly decided to speak about it, because this frankness could\r\nnot make the situation much worse than it was. He did not suppose for a\r\nmoment that Wang had the revolver anywhere about his person; and after\r\nhaving thought the matter over, he had arrived at the conclusion that\r\nthe Chinaman never meant to use the weapon against him. After a slight\r\nstart, because the direct charge had taken him unawares, Wang tore open\r\nthe front of his jacket with a convulsive show of indignation.\r\n\r\n"No hab got. Look see!" he mouthed in pretended anger.\r\n\r\nHe slapped his bare chest violently; he uncovered his very ribs, all\r\nastir with the panting of outraged virtue; his smooth stomach heaved\r\nwith indignation. He started his wide blue breeches flapping about his\r\nyellow calves. Heyst watched him quietly.\r\n\r\n"I never said you had it on you," he observed, without raising his\r\nvoice; "but the revolver is gone from where I kept it."\r\n\r\n"Me no savee levolvel," Wang said obstinately.\r\n\r\nThe book lying open on Heyst\'s knee slipped suddenly and he made a\r\nsharp movement to catch it up. Wang was unable to see the reason of\r\nthis because of the table, and leaped away from what seemed to him a\r\nthreatening symptom. When Heyst looked up, the Chinaman was already at\r\nthe door facing the room, not frightened, but alert.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked Heyst.\r\n\r\nWang nodded his shaven head significantly at the curtain closing the\r\ndoorway of the bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Me no likee," he repeated.\r\n\r\n"What the devil do you mean?" Heyst was genuinely amazed. "Don\'t like\r\nwhat?"\r\n\r\nWang pointed a long lemon-coloured finger at the motionless folds.\r\n\r\n"Two," he said.\r\n\r\n"Two what? I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you savee, you no like that fashion. Me savee plenty. Me go\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nHeyst had risen from his chair, but Wang kept his ground in the doorway\r\nfor a little longer. His almond-shaped eyes imparted to his face an\r\nexpression of soft and sentimental melancholy. The muscles of his throat\r\nmoved visibly while he uttered a distinct and guttural "Goodbye" and\r\nvanished from Number One\'s sight.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman\'s departure altered the situation. Heyst reflected on what\r\nwould be best to do in view of that fact. For a long time he hesitated;\r\nthen, shrugging his shoulders wearily, he walked out on the veranda,\r\ndown the steps, and continued at a steady gait, with a thoughtful mien,\r\nin the direction of his guests\' bungalow. He wanted to make an important\r\ncommunication to them, and he had no other object--least of all to give\r\nthem the shock of a surprise call. Nevertheless, their brutish henchman\r\nnot being on watch, it was Heyst\'s fate to startle Mr. Jones and his\r\nsecretary by his sudden appearance in the doorway. Their conversation\r\nmust have been very interesting to prevent them from hearing the\r\nvisitor\'s approach. In the dim room--the shutters were kept constantly\r\nclosed against the heat--Heyst saw them start apart. It was Mr. Jones\r\nwho spoke:\r\n\r\n"Ah, here you are again! Come in, come in!"\r\n\r\nHeyst, taking his hat off in the doorway, entered the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\nWaking up suddenly, Lena looked, without raising her head from the\r\npillow, at the room in which she was alone. She got up quickly, as if\r\nto counteract the awful sinking of her heart by the vigorous use of her\r\nlimbs. But this sinking was only momentary. Mistress of herself from\r\npride, from love, from necessity, and also because of a woman\'s\r\nvanity in self-sacrifice, she met Heyst, returning from the strangers\'\r\nbungalow, with a clear glance and a smile.\r\n\r\nThe smile he managed to answer, but, noticing that he avoided her eyes,\r\nshe composed her lips and lowered her gaze. For the same reason she\r\nhastened to speak to him in a tone of indifference, which she put on\r\nwithout effort, as if she had grown adept in duplicity since sunrise.\r\n\r\n"You have been over there again?"\r\n\r\n"I have. I thought--but you had better know first that we have lost Wang\r\nfor good."\r\n\r\nShe repeated "For good?" as if she had not understood.\r\n\r\n"For good or evil--I shouldn\'t know which if you were to ask me. He has\r\ndismissed himself. He\'s gone."\r\n\r\n"You expected him to go, though, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nHeyst sat down on the other side of the table.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I expected it as soon as I discovered that he had annexed my\r\nrevolver. He says he hasn\'t taken it. That\'s untrue of course. A\r\nChinaman would not see the sense of confessing under any circumstances.\r\nTo deny any charge is a principle of right conduct; but he hardly\r\nexpected to be believed. He was a little enigmatic at the last, Lena. He\r\nstartled me."\r\n\r\nHeyst paused. The girl seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.\r\n\r\n"He startled me," repeated Heyst. She noted the anxiety in his tone, and\r\nturned her head slightly to look at him across the table.\r\n\r\n"It must have been something--to startle you," she said. In the depth\r\nof her parted lips, like a ripe pomegranate, there was a gleam of white\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n"It was only a single word--and some of his gestures. He had been making\r\na good deal of noise. I wonder we didn\'t wake you up. How soundly you\r\ncan sleep! I say, do you feel all right now?"\r\n\r\n"As fresh as can be," she said, treating him to another deep gleam of\r\na smile. "I heard no noise, and I\'m glad of it. The way he talks in his\r\nharsh voice frightens me. I don\'t like all these foreign people."\r\n\r\n"It was just before he went away--bolted out, I should say. He nodded\r\nand pointed at the curtain to our room. He knew you were there, of\r\ncourse. He seemed to think--he seemed to try to give me to understand\r\nthat you were in special--well, danger. You know how he talks."\r\n\r\nShe said nothing; she made no sound, only the faint tinge of colour\r\nebbed out of her cheek.\r\n\r\n"Yes," Heyst went on. "He seemed to try to warn me. That must have been\r\nit Did he imagine I had forgotten your existence? The only word he said\r\nwas \'two\'. It sounded so, at least. Yes, \'two\'--and that he didn\'t like\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"What does that mean?" she whispered.\r\n\r\n"We know what the word two means, don\'t we, Lena? We are two. Never\r\nwere such a lonely two out of the world, my dear! He might have tried\r\nto remind me that he himself has a woman to look after. Why are you so\r\npale, Lena?"\r\n\r\n"Am I pale?" she asked negligently.\r\n\r\n"You are." Heyst was really anxious.\r\n\r\n"Well, it isn\'t from fright," she protested truthfully.\r\n\r\nIndeed, what she felt was a sort of horror which left her absolutely\r\nin the full possession of all her faculties; more difficult to bear,\r\nperhaps, for that reason, but not paralysing to her fortitude.\r\n\r\nHeyst in his turn smiled at her.\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know that there is any reason to be frightened."\r\n\r\n"I mean I am not frightened for myself."\r\n\r\n"I believe you are very plucky," he said. The colour had returned to her\r\nface. "I" continued Heyst, "am so rebellious to outward impressions\r\nthat I can\'t say that much about myself. I don\'t react with sufficient\r\ndistinctness." He changed his tone. "You know I went to see those men\r\nfirst thing this morning."\r\n\r\n"I know. Be careful!" she murmured.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how one can be careful! I had a long talk with--but I don\'t\r\nbelieve you have seen them. One of them is a fantastically thin, long\r\nperson, apparently ailing; I shouldn\'t wonder if he were really so. He\r\nmakes rather a point of it in a mysterious manner. I imagine he must\r\nhave suffered from tropical fevers, but not so much as he tries to make\r\nout. He\'s what people would call a gentleman. He seemed on the point of\r\nvolunteering a tale of his adventures--for which I didn\'t ask him--but\r\nremarked that it was a long story; some other time, perhaps.\r\n\r\n"\'I suppose you would like to know who I am?\' he asked me.\r\n\r\n"I told him I would leave it to him, in a tone which, between gentlemen,\r\ncould have left no doubt in his mind. He raised himself on his elbow--he\r\nwas lying down on the camp-bed--and said:\r\n\r\n"\'I am he who is--\'"\r\n\r\nLena seemed not to be listening; but when Heyst paused, she turned her\r\nhead quickly to him. He took it for a movement of inquiry, but in this\r\nhe was wrong. A great vagueness enveloped her impressions, but all her\r\nenergy was concentrated on the struggle that she wanted to take upon\r\nherself, in a great exaltation of love and self-sacrifice, which is\r\nwoman\'s sublime faculty; altogether on herself, every bit of it, leaving\r\nhim nothing, not even the knowledge of what she did, if that were\r\npossible. She would have liked to lock him up by some stratagem. Had\r\nshe known of some means to put him to sleep for days she would have used\r\nincantations or philtres without misgivings. He seemed to her too good\r\nfor such contacts, and not sufficiently equipped. This last feeling had\r\nnothing to do with the material fact of the revolver being stolen. She\r\ncould hardly appreciate that fact at its full value.\r\n\r\nObserving her eyes fixed and as if sightless--for the concentration on\r\nher purpose took all expression out of them--Heyst imagined it to be the\r\neffect of a great mental effort.\r\n\r\n"No use asking me what he meant, Lena; I don\'t know, and I did not\r\nask him. The gentleman, as I have told you before, seems devoted to\r\nmystification. I said nothing, and he laid down his head again on\r\nthe bundle of rugs he uses for a pillow. He affects a state of great\r\nweakness, but I suspect that he\'s perfectly capable of leaping to his\r\nfeet if he likes. Having been ejected, he said, from his proper social\r\nsphere because he had refused to conform to certain usual conventions,\r\nhe was a rebel now, and was coming and going up and down the earth. As\r\nI really did not want to listen to all this nonsense, I told him that\r\nI had heard that sort of story about somebody else before. His grin is\r\nreally ghastly. He confessed that I was very far from the sort of man he\r\nexpected to meet. Then he said:\r\n\r\n"\'As to me, I am no blacker than the gentleman you are thinking of, and\r\nI have neither more nor less determination.\'"\r\n\r\nHeyst looked across the table at Lena. Propped on her elbows, and\r\nholding her head in both hands, she moved it a little with an air of\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n"Nothing could be plainer, eh?" said Heyst grimly. "Unless, indeed, this\r\nis his idea of a pleasant joke; for, when he finished speaking, he burst\r\ninto a loud long laugh. I didn\'t join him!"\r\n\r\n"I wish you had," she breathed out.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t join him. It did not occur to me. I am not much of a\r\ndiplomatist. It would probably have been wise, for, indeed, I believe\r\nhe had said more than he meant to say, and was trying to take it back by\r\nthis affected jocularity. Yet when one thinks of it, diplomacy without\r\nforce in the background is but a rotten reed to lean upon. And I don\'t\r\nknow whether I could have done it if I had thought of it. I don\'t know.\r\nIt would have been against the grain. Could I have done it? I have lived\r\ntoo long within myself, watching the mere shadows and shades of life.\r\nTo deceive a man on some issue which could be decided quicker, by his\r\ndestruction while one is disarmed, helpless, without even the power to\r\nrun away--no! That seems to me too degrading. And yet I have you here.\r\nI have your very existence in my keeping. What do you say, Lena? Would I\r\nbe capable of throwing you to the lions to save my dignity?"\r\n\r\nShe got up, walked quickly round the table, posed herself on his knees\r\nlightly, throwing one arm round his neck, and whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n"You may if you like. And may be that\'s the only way I would consent to\r\nleave you. For something like that. If it were something no bigger than\r\nyour little finger."\r\n\r\nShe gave him a light kiss on the lips and was gone before he could\r\ndetain her. She regained her seat and propped her elbows again on the\r\ntable. It was hard to believe that she had moved from the spot at all.\r\nThe fleeting weight of her body on his knees, the hug round his neck,\r\nthe whisper in his ear, the kiss on his lips, might have been the\r\nunsubstantial sensations of a dream invading the reality of waking life;\r\na sort of charming mirage in the barren aridity of his thoughts. He\r\nhesitated to speak till she said, businesslike:\r\n\r\n"Well. And what then?"\r\n\r\nHeyst gave a start.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I didn\'t join him. I let him have his laugh out by himself. He\r\nwas shaking all over, like a merry skeleton, under a cotton sheet he was\r\ncovered with--I believe in order to conceal the revolver that he had in\r\nhis right hand. I didn\'t see it, but I have a distinct impression it was\r\nthere in his fist. As he had not been looking at me for some time, but\r\nstaring into a certain part of the room, I turned my head and saw a\r\nhairy, wild sort of creature which they take about with them, squatting\r\non its heels in the angle of the walls behind me. He wasn\'t there when\r\nI came in. I didn\'t like the notion of that watchful monster behind my\r\nback. If I had been less at their mercy, I should certainly have changed\r\nmy position. As things are now, to move would have been a mere weakness.\r\nSo I remained where I was. The gentleman on the bed said he could assure\r\nme of one thing; and that was that his presence here was no more morally\r\nreprehensible than mine.\r\n\r\n"\'We pursue the same ends,\' he said, \'only perhaps I pursue them with\r\nmore openness than you--with more simplicity.\'\r\n\r\n"That\'s what he said," Heyst went on, after looking at Lena in a sort of\r\ninquiring silence. "I asked him if he knew beforehand that I was living\r\nhere; but he only gave me a ghastly grin. I didn\'t press him for an\r\nanswer, Lena. I thought I had better not."\r\n\r\nOn her smooth forehead a ray of light always seemed to rest. Her loose\r\nhair, parted in the middle, covered the hands sustaining her head. She\r\nseemed spellbound by the interest of the narrative. Heyst did not pause\r\nlong. He managed to continue his relation smoothly enough, beginning\r\nafresh with a piece of comment.\r\n\r\n"He would have lied impudently--and I detest being told a lie. It makes\r\nme uncomfortable. It\'s pretty clear that I am not fitted for the affairs\r\nof the wide world. But I did not want him to think that I accepted his\r\npresence too meekly, so I said that his comings or goings on the\r\nearth were none of my business, of course, except that I had a natural\r\ncuriosity to know when he would find it convenient to resume them.\r\n\r\n"He asked me to look at the state he was in. Had I been all alone here,\r\nas they think I am, I should have laughed at him. But not being alone--I\r\nsay, Lena, you are sure you haven\'t shown yourself where you could be\r\nseen?"\r\n\r\n"Certain," she said promptly.\r\n\r\nHe looked relieved.\r\n\r\n"You understand, Lena, that when I ask you to keep so strictly out of\r\nsight, it is because you are not for them to look at--to talk about. My\r\npoor Lena! I can\'t help that feeling. Do you understand it?"\r\n\r\nShe moved her head slightly in a manner that was neither affirmative nor\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\n"People will have to see me some day," she said.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how long it will be possible for you to keep out of sight?"\r\nmurmured Heyst thoughtfully. He bent over the table. "Let me finish\r\ntelling you. I asked him point blank what it was he wanted with me; he\r\nappeared extremely unwilling to come to the point. It was not really\r\nso pressing as all that, he said. His secretary, who was in fact his\r\npartner, was not present, having gone down to the wharf to look at\r\ntheir boat. Finally the fellow proposed that he should put off a certain\r\ncommunication he had to make till the day after tomorrow. I agreed;\r\nbut I also told him that I was not at all anxious to hear it. I had no\r\nconception in what way his affairs could concern me.\r\n\r\n"\'Ah, Mr. Heyst,\' he said, \'you and I have much more in common than you\r\nthink.\'"\r\n\r\nHeyst struck the table with his fist unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n"It was a jeer; I am sure it was!"\r\n\r\nHe seemed ashamed of this outburst and smiled faintly into the\r\nmotionless eyes of the girl.\r\n\r\n"What could I have done--even if I had had my pockets full of\r\nrevolvers?"\r\n\r\nShe made an appreciative sign.\r\n\r\n"Killing\'s a sin, sure enough," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"I went away," Heyst continued. "I left him there, lying on his side\r\nwith his eyes shut. When I got back here, I found you looking ill. What\r\nwas it, Lena? You did give me a scare! Then I had the interview with\r\nWang while you rested. You were sleeping quietly. I sat here to consider\r\nall these things calmly, to try to penetrate their inner meaning and\r\ntheir outward bearing. It struck me that the two days we have before\r\nus have the character of a sort of truce. The more I thought of it, the\r\nmore I felt that this was tacitly understood between Jones and myself.\r\nIt was to our advantage, if anything can be of advantage to people\r\ncaught so completely unawares as we are. Wang was gone. He, at any rate,\r\nhad declared himself, but as I did not know what he might take it into\r\nhis head to do, I thought I had better warn these people that I was no\r\nlonger responsible for the Chinaman. I did not want Mr. Wang making some\r\nmove which would precipitate the action against us. Do you see my point\r\nof view?"\r\n\r\nShe made a sign that she did. All her soul was wrapped in her passionate\r\ndetermination, in an exalted belief in herself--in the contemplation\r\nof her amazing opportunity to win the certitude, the eternity, of that\r\nman\'s love.\r\n\r\n"I never saw two men," Heyst was saying, "more affected by a piece of\r\ninformation than Jones and his secretary, who was back in the bungalow\r\nby then. They had not heard me come up. I told them I was sorry to\r\nintrude.\r\n\r\n"\'Not at all! Not at all,\' said Jones.\r\n\r\n"The secretary backed away into a corner and watched me like a wary cat.\r\nIn fact, they both were visibly on their guard.\r\n\r\n"\'I am come,\' I told them, \'to let you know that my servant has\r\ndeserted--gone off.\'\r\n\r\n"At first they looked at each other as if they had not understood what I\r\nwas saying; but very soon they seemed quite concerned.\r\n\r\n"\'You mean to say your Chink\'s cleared out?\' said Ricardo, coming\r\nforward from his corner. \'Like this--all at once? What did he do it\r\nfor?\'\r\n\r\n"I said that a Chinaman had always a simple and precise reason for what\r\nhe did, but that to get such a reason out of him was not so easy. All he\r\ntold me, I said, was that he \'didn\'t like\'.\r\n\r\n"They were extremely disturbed at this. Didn\'t like what, they wanted to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n"\'The looks of you and your party,\' I told Jones.\r\n\r\n"\'Nonsense!\' he cried out, and immediately Ricardo, the short man,\r\nstruck in.\r\n\r\n"\'Told you that? What did he take you for, sir--an infant? Or do you\r\ntake us for kids?--meaning no offence. Come, I bet you will tell us next\r\nthat you\'ve missed something.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'I didn\'t mean to tell you anything of the sort,\' I said, \'but as a\r\nmatter of fact it is so.\'\r\n\r\n"He slapped his thigh.\r\n\r\n"\'Thought so. What do you think of this trick, governor?\'\r\n\r\n"Jones made some sort of sign to him, and then that extraordinary\r\ncat-faced associate proposed that he and their servant should come out\r\nand help me catch or kill the Chink.\r\n\r\n"My object, I said, was not to get assistance. I did not intend to chase\r\nthe Chinaman. I had come only to warn them that he was armed, and that\r\nhe really objected to their presence on the island. I wanted them to\r\nunderstand that I was not responsible for anything that might happen.\r\n\r\n"\'Do you mean to tell us,\' asked Ricardo, \'that there is a crazy Chink\r\nwith a six-shooter broke loose on this island, and that you don\'t care?\'\r\n\r\n"Strangely enough they did not seem to believe my story. They were\r\nexchanging significant looks all the time. Ricardo stole up close to\r\nhis principal; they had a confabulation together, and then something\r\nhappened which I did not expect. It\'s rather awkward, too.\r\n\r\n"Since I would not have their assistance to get hold of the Chink\r\nand recover my property, the least they could do was to send me their\r\nservant. It was Jones who said that, and Ricardo backed up the idea.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, yes--let our Pedro cook for all hands in your compound! He isn\'t\r\nso bad as he looks. That\'s what we will do!\'\r\n\r\n"He bustled out of the room to the veranda, and let out an ear-splitting\r\nwhistle for their Pedro. Having heard the brute\'s answering howl,\r\nRicardo ran back into the room.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, Mr. Heyst. This will do capitally, Mr. Heyst. You just direct\r\nhim to do whatever you are accustomed to have done for you in the way of\r\nattendance. See?\'\r\n\r\n"Lena, I confess to you that I was taken completely by surprise. I had\r\nnot expected anything of the sort. I don\'t know what I expected. I am so\r\nanxious about you that I can\'t keep away from these infernal scoundrels.\r\nAnd only two months ago I would not have cared. I would have defied\r\ntheir scoundrelism as much as I have scorned all the other intrusions of\r\nlife. But now I have you! You stole into my life, and--"\r\n\r\nHeyst drew a deep breath. The girl gave him a quick, wide-eyed glance.\r\n\r\n"Ah! That\'s what you are thinking of--that you have me!"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to read the thoughts veiled by her steady grey eyes,\r\nto penetrate the meaning of her silences, her words, and even her\r\nembraces. He used to come out of her very arms with the feeling of a\r\nbaffled man.\r\n\r\n"If I haven\'t you, if you are not here, then where are you?" cried\r\nHeyst. "You understand me very well."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head a little. Her red lips, at which he looked now, her\r\nlips as fascinating as the voice that came out of them, uttered the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n"I hear what you say; but what does it mean?"\r\n\r\n"It means that I could lie and perhaps cringe for your sake."\r\n\r\n"No! No! Don\'t you ever do that," she said in haste, while her eyes\r\nglistened suddenly. "You would hate me for it afterwards!"\r\n\r\n"Hate you?" repeated Heyst, who had recalled his polite manner. "No!\r\nYou needn\'t consider the extremity of the improbable--as yet. But I will\r\nconfess to you that I--how shall I call it?--that I dissembled. First I\r\ndissembled my dismay at the unforeseen result of my idiotic diplomacy.\r\nDo you understand, my dear girl?"\r\n\r\nIt was evident that she did not understand the word. Heyst produced his\r\nplayful smile, which contrasted oddly with the worried character of his\r\nwhole expression. His temples seemed to have sunk in, his face looked a\r\nlittle leaner.\r\n\r\n"A diplomatic statement, Lena, is a statement of which everything is\r\ntrue, but the sentiment which seems to prompt it. I have never been\r\ndiplomatic in my relation with mankind--not from regard for its\r\nfeelings, but from a certain regard for my own. Diplomacy doesn\'t go\r\nwell with consistent contempt. I cared little for life and still less\r\nfor death."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk like that!"\r\n\r\n"I dissembled my extreme longing to take these wandering scoundrels\r\nby their throats," he went on. "I have only two hands--I wish I had a\r\nhundred to defend you--and there were three throats. By that time\r\ntheir Pedro was in the room too. Had he seen me engaged with their two\r\nthroats, he would have been at mine like a fierce dog, or any other\r\nsavage and faithful brute. I had no difficulty in dissembling my longing\r\nfor the vulgar, stupid, and hopeless argument of fight. I remarked that\r\nI really did not want a servant. I couldn\'t think of depriving them of\r\ntheir man\'s services; but they would not hear me. They had made up their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n"\'We shall send him over at once,\' Ricardo said, \'to start cooking\r\ndinner for everybody. I hope you won\'t mind me coming to eat it with\r\nyou in your bungalow; and we will send the governor\'s dinner over to him\r\nhere.\'\r\n\r\n"I could do nothing but hold my tongue or bring on a quarrel--some\r\nmanifestation of their dark purpose, which we have no means to resist.\r\nOf course, you may remain invisible this evening; but with that\r\natrocious-brute prowling all the time at the back of the house, how long\r\ncan your presence be concealed from these men?"\r\n\r\nHeyst\'s distress could be felt in his silence. The girl\'s head,\r\nsustained by her hands buried in the thick masses of her hair, had a\r\nperfect immobility.\r\n\r\n"You are certain you have not been seen so far?" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe motionless head spoke.\r\n\r\n"How can I be certain? You told me you wanted me to keep out of the way.\r\nI kept out of the way. I didn\'t ask your reason. I thought you didn\'t\r\nwant people to know that you had a girl like me about you."\r\n\r\n"What? Ashamed?" cried Heyst.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t what\'s right, perhaps--I mean for you--is it?"\r\n\r\nHeyst lifted his hands, reproachfully courteous.\r\n\r\n"I look upon it as so very much right that I couldn\'t bear the idea of\r\nany other than sympathetic, respectful eyes resting on you. I disliked\r\nand mistrusted these fellows from the first. Didn\'t you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I did keep out of sight," she said.\r\n\r\nA silence fell. At last Heyst stirred slightly.\r\n\r\n"All this is of very little importance now," he said with a sigh.\r\n"This is a question of something infinitely worse than mere looks and\r\nthoughts, however base and contemptible. As I have told you, I met\r\nRicardo\'s suggestions by silence. As I was turning away he said:\r\n\r\n"\'If you happen to have the key of that store-room of yours on you,\r\nMr. Heyst, you may just as well let me have it; I will give it to our\r\nPedro.\'\r\n\r\n"I had it on me, and I tendered it to him without speaking. The hairy\r\ncreature was at the door by then, and caught the key, which Ricardo\r\nthrew to him, better than any trained ape could have done. I came away.\r\nAll the time I had been thinking anxiously of you, whom I had left\r\nasleep, alone here, and apparently ill."\r\n\r\nHeyst interrupted himself, with a listening turn of his head. He had\r\nheard the faint sound of sticks being snapped in the compound. He rose\r\nand crossed the room to look out of the back door.\r\n\r\n"And here the creature is," he said, returning to the table. "Here he\r\nis, already attending to the fire. Oh, my dear Lena!"\r\n\r\nShe had followed him with her eyes. She watched him go out on the front\r\nveranda cautiously. He lowered stealthily a couple of screens that hung\r\nbetween the column, and remained outside very still, as if interested\r\nby something on the open ground. Meantime she had risen in her turn, to\r\ntake a peep into the compound. Heyst, glancing over his shoulder, saw\r\nher returning to her seat. He beckoned to her, and she continued to\r\nmove, crossing the shady room, pure and bright in her white dress, her\r\nhair loose, with something of a sleep-walker in her unhurried motion, in\r\nher extended hand, in the sightless effect of her grey eyes luminous in\r\nthe half-light. He had never seen such an expression in her face\r\nbefore. It had dreaminess in it, intense attention, and something like\r\nsternness. Arrested in the doorway by Heyst\'s extended arm, she seemed\r\nto wake up, flushed faintly--and this flush, passing off, carried away\r\nwith it the strange transfiguring mood. With a courageous gesture\r\nshe pushed back the heavy masses of her hair. The light clung to her\r\nforehead. Her delicate nostrils quivered. Heyst seized her arm and\r\nwhispered excitedly:\r\n\r\n"Slip out here, quickly! The screens will conceal you. Only you must\r\nmind the stair-space. They are actually out--I mean the other two. You\r\nhad better see them before you--"\r\n\r\nShe made a barely perceptible movement of recoil, checked at once, and\r\nstood still. Heyst released her arm.\r\n\r\n"Yes, perhaps I had better," she said with unnatural deliberation, and\r\nstepped out on the veranda to stand close by his side.\r\n\r\nTogether, one on each side of the screen, they peeped between the edge\r\nof the canvas and the veranda-post entwined with creepers. A great heat\r\nascended from the sun-smitten ground, in an ever-rising wave, as if from\r\nsome secret store of earth\'s fiery heart; for the sky was growing cooler\r\nalready, and the sun had declined sufficiently for the shadows of Mr.\r\nJones and his henchman to be projected towards the bungalow side by\r\nside--one infinitely slender, the other short and broad.\r\n\r\nThe two visitors stood still and gazed. To keep up the fiction of his\r\ninvalidism, Mr. Jones, the gentleman, leaned on the arm of Ricardo, the\r\nsecretary, the top of whose hat just came up to his governor\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Do you see them?" Heyst whispered into the girl\'s ear. "Here they\r\nare, the envoys of the outer world. Here they are before you--evil\r\nintelligence, instinctive savagery, arm in arm. The brute force is at\r\nthe back. A trio of fitting envoys perhaps--but what about the welcome?\r\nSuppose I were armed, could I shoot these two down where they stand?\r\nCould I?"\r\n\r\nWithout moving her head, the girl felt for Heyst\'s hand, pressed it and\r\nthereafter did not let it go. He continued, bitterly playful:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I don\'t think so. There is a strain in me which lays me\r\nunder an insensate obligation to avoid even the appearance of murder.\r\nI have never pulled a trigger or lifted my hand on a man, even in\r\nself-defence."\r\n\r\nThe suddenly tightened grip of her hand checked him.\r\n\r\n"They are making a move," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Can they be thinking of coming here?" Heyst wondered anxiously.\r\n\r\n"No, they aren\'t coming this way," she said; and there was another\r\npause. "They are going back to their house," she reported finally.\r\n\r\nAfter watching them a little longer, she let go Heyst\'s hand and moved\r\naway from the screen. He followed her into the room.\r\n\r\n"You have seen them now," he began. "Think what it was to me to see them\r\nland in the dusk, fantasms from the sea--apparitions, chimeras! And they\r\npersist. That\'s the worst of it--they persist. They have no right to\r\nbe--but they are. They ought to have aroused my fury. But I have\r\nrefined everything away by this time--anger, indignation, scorn itself.\r\nNothing\'s left but disgust. Since you have told me of that abominable\r\ncalumny, it has become immense--it extends even to myself." He looked up\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n"But luckily I have you. And if only Wang had not carried off that\r\nmiserable revolver--yes, Lena, here we are, we two!"\r\n\r\nShe put both her hands on his shoulders and looked straight into his\r\neyes. He returned her penetrating gaze. It baffled him. He could not\r\npierce the grey veil of her eyes; but the sadness of her voice thrilled\r\nhim profoundly.\r\n\r\n"You are not reproaching me?" she asked slowly.\r\n\r\n"Reproach? What a word between us! It could only be myself--but the\r\nmention of Wang has given me an idea. I have been, not exactly cringing,\r\nnot exactly lying, but still dissembling. You have been hiding\r\nyourself, to please me, but still you have been hiding. All this is very\r\ndignified. Why shouldn\'t we try begging now? A noble art? Yes. Lena,\r\nwe must go out together. I couldn\'t think of leaving you alone, and\r\nI must--yes, I must speak to Wang. We shall go and seek that man, who\r\nknows what he wants and how to secure what he wants. We will go at\r\nonce!"\r\n\r\n"Wait till I put my hair up," she agreed instantly, and vanished behind\r\nthe curtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain had fallen behind her, she turned her head back with\r\nan expression of infinite and tender concern for him--for him whom she\r\ncould never hope to understand, and whom she was afraid she could never\r\nsatisfy, as if her passion were of a hopelessly lower quality, unable\r\nto appease some exalted and delicate desire of his superior soul. In a\r\ncouple of minutes she reappeared. They left the house by the door of\r\nthe compound, and passed within three feet of the thunderstruck Pedro,\r\nwithout even looking in his direction. He rose from stooping over a fire\r\nof sticks, and, balancing himself clumsily, uncovered his enormous fangs\r\nin gaping astonishment. Then suddenly he set off rolling on his bandy\r\nlegs to impart to his masters the astonishing discovery of a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, Ricardo was lounging alone on the veranda of the\r\nformer counting-house. He scented some new development at once, and ran\r\ndown to meet the trotting, bear-like figure. The deep, growling noises\r\nit made, though they had only a very remote resemblance to the Spanish\r\nlanguage, or indeed to any sort of human speech, were from long\r\npractice quite intelligible to Mr. Jones\'s secretary. Ricardo was rather\r\nsurprised. He had imagined that the girl would continue to keep out of\r\nsight. That line apparently was given up. He did not mistrust her. How\r\ncould he? Indeed, he could not think of her existence calmly.\r\n\r\nHe tried to keep her image out of his mind so that he should be able\r\nto use its powers with some approach to that coolness which the complex\r\nnature of the situation demanded from him, both for his own sake and as\r\nthe faithful follower of plain Mr. Jones, gentleman.\r\n\r\nHe collected his wits and thought. This was a change of policy, probably\r\non the part of Heyst. If so, what could it mean? A deep fellow! Unless\r\nit was her doing; in which case--h\'m--all right. Must be. She would\r\nknow what she was doing. Before him Pedro, lifting his feet alternately,\r\nswayed to and fro sideways--his usual attitude of expectation. His\r\nlittle red eyes, lost in the mass of hair, were motionless. Ricardo\r\nstared into them with calculated contempt and said in a rough, angry\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"Woman! Of course there is. We know that without you!" He gave the tame\r\nmonster a push. "Git! Vamos! Waddle! Get back and cook the dinner. Which\r\nway did they go, then?"\r\n\r\nPedro extended a huge, hairy forearm to show the direction, and went off\r\non his bandy legs. Advancing a few steps, Ricardo was just in time to\r\nsee, above some bushes, two white helmets moving side by side in the\r\nclearing. They disappeared. Now that he had managed to keep Pedro from\r\ninforming the governor that there was a woman on the island, he could\r\nindulge in speculation as to the movements of these people. His attitude\r\ntowards Mr. Jones had undergone a spiritual change, of which he himself\r\nwas not yet fully aware.\r\n\r\nThat morning, before tiffin, after his escape from the Heyst bungalow,\r\ncompleted in such an inspiring way by the recovery of the slipper,\r\nRicardo had made his way to their allotted house, reeling as he ran,\r\nhis head in a whirl. He was wildly excited by visions of inconceivable\r\npromise. He waited to compose himself before he dared to meet the\r\ngovernor. On entering the room, he found Mr. Jones sitting on the camp\r\nbedstead like a tailor on his board, cross-legged, his long back against\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n"I say, sir. You aren\'t going to tell me you are bored?"\r\n\r\n"Bored! No! Where the devil have you been all this time?"\r\n\r\n"Observing--watching--nosing around. What else? I knew you had company.\r\nHave you talked freely, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have," muttered Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\n"Not downright plain, sir?"\r\n\r\n"No. I wished you had been here. You loaf all the morning, and now you\r\ncome in out of breath. What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been wasting my time out there," said Ricardo. "Nothing\'s the\r\nmatter. I--I--might have hurried a bit." He was in truth still panting;\r\nonly it was not with running, but with the tumult of thoughts and\r\nsensations long repressed, which had been set free by the adventure of\r\nthe morning. He was almost distracted by them now. He forgot himself in\r\nthe maze of possibilities threatening and inspiring. "And so you had a\r\nlong talk?" he said, to gain time.\r\n\r\n"Confound you! The sun hasn\'t affected your head, has it? Why are you\r\nstaring at me like a basilisk?"\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, sir. Wasn\'t aware I stared," Ricardo apologized\r\ngood-humouredly. "The sun might well affect a thicker skull than mine.\r\nIt blazes. Phew! What do you think a fellow is, sir--a salamander?"\r\n\r\n"You ought to have been here," observed Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\n"Did the beast give any signs of wanting to prance?" asked Ricardo\r\nquickly, with absolutely genuine anxiety. "It wouldn\'t do, sir. You must\r\nplay him easy for at least a couple of days, sir. I have a plan. I have\r\na notion that I can find out a lot in a couple of days."\r\n\r\n"You have? In what way?"\r\n\r\n"Why, by watching," Ricardo answered slowly.\r\n\r\nMr Jones grunted.\r\n\r\n"Nothing new, that. Watch, eh? Why not pray a little, too?"\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha! That\'s a good one," burst out the secretary, fixing Mr.\r\nJones with mirthless eyes.\r\n\r\nThe latter dropped the subject indolently.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you may be certain of at least two days," he said.\r\n\r\nRicardo recovered himself. His eyes gleamed voluptuously.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll pull this off yet--clean--whole--right through, if you will only\r\ntrust me, sir."\r\n\r\n"I am trusting you right enough," said Mr. Jones. "It\'s your interest,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, Ricardo was truthful enough in his statement. He did\r\nabsolutely believe in success now. But he couldn\'t tell his governor\r\nthat he had intelligences in the enemy\'s camp. It wouldn\'t do to tell\r\nhim of the girl. Devil only knew what he would do if he learned there\r\nwas a woman about. And how could he begin to tell of it? He couldn\'t\r\nconfess his sudden escapade.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll pull it off, sir," he said, with perfectly acted cheerfulness.\r\nHe experienced gusts of awful joy expanding in his heart and hot like a\r\nfanned flame.\r\n\r\n"We must," pronounced Mr. Jones. "This thing, Martin, is not like our\r\nother tries. I have a peculiar feeling about this. It\'s a different\r\nthing. It\'s a sort of test."\r\n\r\nRicardo was impressed by the governor\'s manner; for the first time a\r\nhint of passion could be detected in him. But also a word he used, the\r\nword "test," had struck him as particularly significant somehow. It was\r\nthe last word uttered during that morning\'s conversation. Immediately\r\nafterwards Ricardo went out of the room. It was impossible for him to\r\nkeep still. An elation in which an extraordinary softness mingled with\r\nsavage triumph would not allow it. It prevented his thinking, also. He\r\nwalked up and down the veranda far into the afternoon, eyeing the other\r\nbungalow at every turn. It gave no sign of being inhabited. Once or\r\ntwice he stopped dead short and looked down at his left slipper. Each\r\ntime he chuckled audibly. His restlessness kept on increasing till at\r\nlast it frightened him. He caught hold of the balustrade of the veranda\r\nand stood still, smiling not at his thought but at the strong sense of\r\nlife within him. He abandoned himself to it carelessly, even recklessly.\r\nHe cared for no one, friend or enemy. At that moment Mr. Jones called\r\nhim by name from within. A shadow fell on the secretary\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Here, sir," he answered; but it was a moment before he could make up\r\nhis mind to go in.\r\n\r\nHe found the governor on his feet. Mr. Jones was tired of lying down\r\nwhen there was no necessity for it. His slender form, gliding about the\r\nroom, came to a standstill.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been thinking, Martin, of something you suggested. At the time it\r\ndid not strike me as practical; but on reflection it seems to me that\r\nto propose a game is as good a way as any to let him understand that the\r\ntime has come to disgorge. It\'s less--how should I say?--vulgar. He will\r\nknow what it means. It\'s not a bad form to give to the business--which\r\nin itself is crude, Martin, crude."\r\n\r\n"Want to spare his feelings?" jeered the secretary in such a bitter tone\r\nthat Mr. Jones was really surprised.\r\n\r\n"Why, it was your own notion, confound you!"\r\n\r\n"Who says it wasn\'t?" retorted Ricardo sulkily. "But I am fairly sick of\r\nthis crawling. No! No! Get the exact bearings of his swag and then a rip\r\nup. That\'s plenty good enough for him."\r\n\r\nHis passions being thoroughly aroused, a thirst for blood was allied in\r\nhim with a thirst for tenderness--yes, tenderness. A sort of anxious,\r\nmelting sensation pervaded and softened his heart when he thought of\r\nthat girl--one of his own sort. And at the same time jealousy started\r\ngnawing at his breast as the image of Heyst intruded itself on his\r\nfierce anticipation of bliss.\r\n\r\n"The crudeness of your ferocity is positively gross, Martin," Mr. Jones\r\nsaid disdainfully. "You don\'t even understand my purpose. I mean to\r\nhave some sport out of him. Just try to imagine the atmosphere of the\r\ngame--the fellow handling the cards--the agonizing mockery of it! Oh,\r\nI shall appreciate this greatly. Yes, let him lose his money instead of\r\nbeing forced to hand it over. You, of course, would shoot him at once,\r\nbut I shall enjoy the refinement and the jest of it. He\'s a man of the\r\nbest society. I\'ve been hounded out of my sphere by people very much\r\nlike that fellow. How enraged and humiliated he will be! I promise\r\nmyself some exquisite moments while watching his play."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and suppose he suddenly starts prancing. He may not appreciate the\r\nfun."\r\n\r\n"I mean you to be present," Mr. Jones remarked calmly.\r\n\r\n"Well, as long as I am free to plug him or rip him up whenever I think\r\nthe time has come, you are welcome to your bit of sport, sir. I shan\'t\r\nspoil it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\nIt was at this precise moment of their conversation that Heyst had\r\nintruded on Mr. Jones and his secretary with his warning about Wang, as\r\nhe had related to Lena. When he left them, the two looked at each other\r\nin wondering silence. My Jones was the first to break it.\r\n\r\n"I say, Martin!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"What does this mean?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s some move. Blame me if I can understand."\r\n\r\n"Too deep for you?" Mr. Jones inquired dryly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing but some of his infernal impudence," growled the\r\nsecretary. "You don\'t believe all that about the Chink, do you, sir?\r\n\'Tain\'t true."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t necessary for it to be true to have a meaning for us. It\'s the\r\nwhy of his coming to tell us this tale that\'s important."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he made it up to frighten us?" asked Ricardo.\r\n\r\nMr Jones scowled at him thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"The man looked worried," he muttered, as if to himself. "Suppose that\r\nChinaman has really stolen his money! The man looked very worried."\r\n\r\n"Nothing but his artfulness, sir," protested Ricardo earnestly, for the\r\nidea was too disconcerting to entertain. "Is it likely that he would\r\nhave trusted a Chink with enough knowledge to make it possible?" he\r\nargued warmly. "Why, it\'s the very thing that he would keep close about.\r\nThere\'s something else there. Ay, but what?"\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" Mr. Jones let out a ghostly, squeaky laugh. "I\'ve never\r\nbeen placed in such a ridiculous position before," he went on, with a\r\nsepulchral equanimity of tone. "It\'s you, Martin, who dragged me into\r\nit. However, it\'s my own fault too. I ought to--but I was really\r\ntoo bored to use my brain, and yours is not to be trusted. You are a\r\nhothead!"\r\n\r\nA blasphemous exclamation of grief escaped from Ricardo. Not to be\r\ntrusted! Hothead! He was almost tearful.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I heard you, sir, saying more than twenty times since we got\r\nfired out from Manila that we should want a lot of capital to work the\r\nEast Coast with? You were always telling me that to prime properly all\r\nthem officials and Portuguese scallywags we should have to lose heavily\r\nat first. Weren\'t you always worrying about some means of getting hold\r\nof a good lot of cash? It wasn\'t to be got hold of by allowing yourself\r\nto become bored in that rotten Dutch town and playing a two-penny game\r\nwith confounded beggarly bank clerks and such like. Well, I\'ve brought\r\nyou here, where there is cash to be got--and a big lot, to a moral," he\r\nadded through his set teeth.\r\n\r\nSilence fell. Each of them was staring into a different corner of the\r\nroom. Suddenly, with a slight stamp of his foot, Mr. Jones made for the\r\ndoor. Ricardo caught him up outside.\r\n\r\n"Put an arm through mine, sir," he begged him gently but firmly. "No use\r\ngiving the game away. An invalid may well come out for a breath of fresh\r\nair after the sun\'s gone down a bit. That\'s it, sir. But where do you\r\nwant to go? Why did you come out, sir?"\r\n\r\nMr Jones stopped short.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know myself," he confessed in a hollow mutter, staring\r\nintently at the Number One bungalow. "It\'s quite irrational," he\r\ndeclared in a still lower tone.\r\n\r\n"Better go in, sir," suggested Ricardo. "What\'s that? Those screens\r\nweren\'t down before. He\'s spying from behind them now, I bet--the\r\ndodging, artful, plotting beast!"\r\n\r\n"Why not go over there and see if we can\'t get to the bottom of this\r\ngame?" was the unexpected proposal uttered by Mr. Jones. "He will have\r\nto talk to us."\r\n\r\nRicardo repressed a start of dismay, but for a moment could not speak.\r\nHe only pressed the governor\'s hand to his side instinctively.\r\n\r\n"No, sir. What could you say? Do you expect to get to the bottom of his\r\nlies? How could you make him talk? It isn\'t time yet to come to grips\r\nwith that gent. You don\'t think I would hang back, do you? His Chink, of\r\ncourse, I\'ll shoot like a dog the moment I catch sight of him; but as\r\nto that Mr. Blasted Heyst, the time isn\'t yet. My head\'s cooler just now\r\nthan yours. Let\'s go in again. Why, we are exposed here. Suppose he\r\ntook it into his head to let off a gun on us! He\'s an unaccountable,\r\n\'yporcritical skunk."\r\n\r\nAllowing himself to be persuaded, Mr. Jones returned to his seclusion.\r\nThe secretary, however, remained on the veranda--for the purpose, he\r\nsaid, of seeing whether that Chink wasn\'t sneaking around; in which\r\ncase he proposed to take a long shot at the galoot and chance the\r\nconsequences. His real reason was that he wanted to be alone, away from\r\nthe governor\'s deep-sunk eyes. He felt a sentimental desire to indulge\r\nhis fancies in solitude. A great change had come over Mr. Ricardo since\r\nthat morning. A whole side of him which from prudence, from necessity,\r\nfrom loyalty, had been kept dormant, was aroused now, colouring\r\nhis thoughts and disturbing his mental poise by the vision of such\r\nstaggering consequences as, for instance, the possibility of an active\r\nconflict with the governor. The appearance of the monstrous Pedro with\r\nhis news drew Ricardo out of a feeling of dreaminess wrapped up in a\r\nsense of impending trouble. A woman? Yes, there was one; and it made all\r\nthe difference. After driving away Pedro, and watching the white\r\nhelmets of Heyst and Lena vanishing among the bushes he stood lost in\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n"Where could they be off to like this?" he mentally asked himself.\r\n\r\nThe answer found by his speculative faculties on their utmost stretch\r\nwas--to meet that Chink. For in the desertion of Wang Ricardo did not\r\nbelieve. It was a lying yarn, the organic part of a dangerous plot.\r\nHeyst had gone to combine some fresh move. But then Ricardo felt sure\r\nthat the girl was with him--the girl full of pluck, full of sense, full\r\nof understanding; an ally of his own kind!\r\n\r\nHe went indoors briskly. Mr. Jones had resumed his cross-legged pose at\r\nthe head of the bed, with his back against the wall.\r\n\r\n"Anything new?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\nRicardo walked about the room as if he had no care in the world. He\r\nhummed snatches of song. Mr. Jones raised his waspish eyebrows, at the\r\nsound. The secretary got down on his knees before an old leather trunk,\r\nand, rummaging in there, brought out a small looking-glass. He fell to\r\nexamining his physiognomy in it with silent absorption.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll shave," he decided, getting up.\r\n\r\nHe gave a sidelong glance to the governor, and repeated it several times\r\nduring the operation, which did not take long, and even afterwards, when\r\nafter putting away the implements, he resumed his walking, humming more\r\nsnatches of unknown songs. Mr. Jones preserved a complete immobility,\r\nhis thin lips compressed, his eyes veiled. His face was like a carving.\r\n\r\n"So you would like to try your hand at cards with that skunk, sir?" said\r\nRicardo, stopping suddenly and rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\nMr Jones gave no sign of having heard anything.\r\n\r\n"Well, why not? Why shouldn\'t he have the experience? You remember in\r\nthat Mexican town--what\'s its name?--the robber fellow they caught in\r\nthe mountains and condemned to be shot? He played cards half the night\r\nwith the jailer and the sheriff. Well, this fellow is condemned, too.\r\nHe must give you your game. Hang it all, a gentleman ought to have some\r\nlittle relaxation! And you have been uncommonly patient, sir."\r\n\r\n"You are uncommonly volatile all of a sudden," Mr. Jones remarked in a\r\nbored voice. "What\'s come to you?"\r\n\r\nThe secretary hummed for a while, and then said:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try to get him over here for you tonight, after dinner. If I ain\'t\r\nhere myself, don\'t you worry, sir. I shall be doing a bit of nosing\r\naround--see?"\r\n\r\n"I see," sneered Mr. Jones languidly. "But what do you expect to see in\r\nthe dark?"\r\n\r\nRicardo made no answer, and after another turn or two slipped out of the\r\nroom. He no longer felt comfortable alone with the governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\nMeantime Heyst and Lena, walking rather fast, approached Wang\'s hut.\r\nAsking the girl to wait, Heyst ascended the little ladder of bamboos\r\ngiving access to the door. It was as he had expected. The smoky interior\r\nwas empty, except for a big chest of sandalwood too heavy for hurried\r\nremoval. Its lid was thrown up, but whatever it might have contained was\r\nno longer there. All Wang\'s possessions were gone. Without tarrying in\r\nthe hut, Heyst came back to the girl, who asked no questions, with her\r\nstrange air of knowing or understanding everything.\r\n\r\n"Let us push on," he said.\r\n\r\nHe went ahead, the rustle of her white skirt following him into the\r\nshades of the forest, along the path of their usual walk. Though the air\r\nlay heavy between straight denuded trunks, the sunlit patches moved on\r\nthe ground, and raising her eyes Lena saw far above her head the\r\nflutter of the leaves, the surface shudder on the mighty limbs extended\r\nhorizontally in the perfect immobility of patience. Twice Heyst looked\r\nover his shoulder at her. Behind the readiness of her answering smile\r\nthere was a fund of devoted, concentrated passion, burning with the hope\r\nof a more perfect satisfaction. They passed the spot where it was their\r\npractice to turn towards the barren summit of the central hill. Heyst\r\nheld steadily on his way towards the upper limit of the forest. The\r\nmoment they left its shelter, a breeze enveloped them, and a great\r\ncloud, racing over the sun, threw a peculiar sombre tint over\r\neverything. Heyst pointed up a precipitous, rugged path clinging to the\r\nside of the hill. It ended in a barricade of felled trees, a primitively\r\nconceived obstacle which must have cost much labour to erect at just\r\nthat spot.\r\n\r\n"This," Heyst, explained in his urbane tone, "is a barrier against the\r\nmarch of civilization. The poor folk over there did not like it, as it\r\nappeared to them in the shape of my company--a great step forward, as\r\nsome people used to call it with mistaken confidence. The advanced foot\r\nhas been drawn back, but the barricade remains."\r\n\r\nThey went on climbing slowly. The cloud had driven over, leaving an\r\nadded brightness on the face of the world.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very ridiculous thing," Heyst went on; "but then it is the\r\nproduct of honest fear--fear of the unknown, of the incomprehensible.\r\nIt\'s pathetic, too, in a way. And I heartily wish, Lena, that we were on\r\nthe other side of it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, stop, stop!" she cried, seizing his arm.\r\n\r\nThe face of the barricade they were approaching had been piled up with a\r\nlot of fresh-cut branches. The leaves were still green. A gentle breeze,\r\nsweeping over the top, stirred them a little; but what had startled the\r\ngirl was the discovery of several spear-blades protruding from the mass\r\nof foliage. She had made them out suddenly. They did not gleam, but she\r\nsaw them with extreme distinctness, very still, very vicious to look at.\r\n\r\n"You had better let me go forward alone, Lena," said Heyst.\r\n\r\nShe tugged, persistently at his arm, but after a time, during which\r\nhe never ceased to look smilingly into her terrified eyes, he ended by\r\ndisengaging himself.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a sign rather than a demonstration," he argued, persuasively.\r\n"Just wait here a moment. I promise not to approach near enough to be\r\nstabbed."\r\n\r\nAs in a nightmare she watched Heyst go up the few yards of the path as\r\nif he never meant to stop; and she heard his voice, like voices heard\r\nin dreams, shouting unknown words in an unearthly tone. Heyst was only\r\ndemanding to see Wang. He was not kept waiting very long. Recovering\r\nfrom the first flurry of her fright, Lena noticed a commotion in the\r\ngreen top-dressing of the barricade. She exhaled a sigh of relief when\r\nthe spear-blades retreated out of sight, sliding inward--the horrible\r\nthings! in a spot facing Heyst a pair of yellow hands parted the leaves,\r\nand a face filled the small opening--a face with very noticeable eyes.\r\nIt was Wang\'s face, of course, with no suggestion of a body belonging to\r\nit, like those cardboard faces at which she remembered gazing as a child\r\nin the window of a certain dim shop kept by a mysterious little man in\r\nKingsland Road. Only this face, instead of mere holes, had eyes which\r\nblinked. She could see the beating of the eyelids. The hands on each\r\nside of the face, keeping the boughs apart, also did not look as if they\r\nbelonged to any real body. One of them was holding a revolver--a weapon\r\nwhich she recognized merely by intuition, never having seen such an\r\nobject before.\r\n\r\nShe leaned her shoulders against the rock of the perpendicular hillside\r\nand kept her eyes on Heyst, with comparative composure, since the spears\r\nwere not menacing him any longer. Beyond the rigid and motionless back\r\nhe presented to her, she saw Wang\'s unreal cardboard face moving its\r\nthin lips and grimacing artificially. She was too far down the path to\r\nhear the dialogue, carried on in an ordinary voice. She waited patiently\r\nfor its end. Her shoulders felt the warmth of the rock; now and then a\r\nwhiff of cooler air seemed to slip down upon her head from above; the\r\nravine at her feet, choked full of vegetation, emitted the faint, drowsy\r\nhum of insect life. Everything was very quiet. She failed to notice\r\nthe exact moment when Wang\'s head vanished from the foliage, taking the\r\nunreal hands away with it. To her horror, the spear-blades came gliding\r\nslowly out. The very hair on her head stirred; but before she had\r\ntime to cry out, Heyst, who seemed rooted to the ground, turned round\r\nabruptly and began to move towards her. His great moustaches did not\r\nquite hide an ugly but irresolute smile; and when he had come down near\r\nenough to touch her, he burst out into a harsh laugh:\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, uncomprehending. He cut short his laugh and said\r\ncurtly:\r\n\r\n"We had better go down as we came."\r\n\r\nShe followed him into the forest. The advance of the afternoon had\r\nfilled it with gloom. Far away a slant of light between the trees closed\r\nthe view. All was dark beyond. Heyst stopped.\r\n\r\n"No reason to hurry, Lena," he said in his ordinary, serenely polite\r\ntones. "We return unsuccessful. I suppose you know, or at least can\r\nguess, what was my object in coming up there?"\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t guess, dear," she said, and smiled, noticing with\r\nemotion that his breast was heaving as if he had been out of breath.\r\nNevertheless, he tried to command his speech, pausing only a little\r\nbetween the words.\r\n\r\n"No? I went up to find Wang. I went up"--he gasped again here, but this\r\nwas for the last time--"I made you come with me because I didn\'t like\r\nto leave you unprotected in the proximity of those fellows." Suddenly he\r\nsnatched his cork helmet off his head and dashed it on the ground. "No!"\r\nhe cried roughly. "All this is too unreal altogether. It isn\'t to be\r\nborne! I can\'t protect you! I haven\'t the power."\r\n\r\nHe glared at her for a moment, then hastened after his hat which had\r\nbounded away to some distance. He came back looking at her face, which\r\nwas very white.\r\n\r\n"I ought to beg your pardon for these antics," he said, adjusting his\r\nhat. "A movement of childish petulance! Indeed, I feel very much like a\r\nchild in my ignorance, in my powerlessness, in my want of resource, in\r\neverything except in the dreadful consciousness of some evil hanging\r\nover your head--yours!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s you they are after," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"No doubt, but unfortunately--"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately--what?"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, I have not succeeded with Wang," he said. "I failed to\r\nmove his Celestial, heart--that is, if there is such a thing. He told me\r\nwith horrible Chinese reasonableness that he could not let us pass the\r\nbarrier, because we should be pursued. He doesn\'t like fights. He gave\r\nme to understand that he would shoot me with my own revolver without\r\nany sort of compunction, rather than risk a rude and distasteful\r\ncontest with the strange barbarians for my sake. He has preached to the\r\nvillagers. They respect him. He is the most remarkable man they have\r\never seen, and their kinsman by marriage. They understand his policy.\r\nAnd anyway only women and children and a few old fellows are left in the\r\nvillage. This is the season when the men are away in trading vessels.\r\nBut it would have been all the same. None of them have a taste for\r\nfighting--and with white men too! They are peaceable, kindly folk and\r\nwould have seen me shot with extreme satisfaction. Wang seemed to think\r\nmy insistence--for I insisted, you know--very stupid and tactless. But a\r\ndrowning man clutches at straws. We were talking in such Malay as we are\r\nboth equal to.\r\n\r\n"\'Your fears are foolish,\' I said to him.\r\n\r\n"\'Foolish? of course I am foolish,\' he replied. \'If I were a wise man,\r\nI would be a merchant with a big hong in Singapore, instead of being a\r\nmine coolie turned houseboy. But if you don\'t go away in time, I will\r\nshoot you before it grows too dark to take aim. Not till then, Number\r\nOne, but I will do it then. Now--finish!\'\r\n\r\n"\'All right,\' I said. \'Finish as far as I am concerned; but you can have\r\nno objections to the mem putih coming over to stay with the Orang Kaya\'s\r\nwomen for a few days. I will make a present in silver for it.\' Orang\r\nKaya, is the head man of the village, Lena," added Heyst.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"You wanted me to go to that village of savages?" she gasped. "You\r\nwanted me to leave you?"\r\n\r\n"It would have given me a freer hand."\r\n\r\nHeyst stretched out his hands and looked at them for a moment, then let\r\nthem fall by his side. Indignation was expressed more in the curve of\r\nher lips than in her clear eyes, which never wavered.\r\n\r\n"I believe Wang laughed," he went on. "He made a noise like a\r\nturkey-cock."\r\n\r\n"\'That would be worse than anything,\' he told me.\r\n\r\n"I was taken aback. I pointed out to him that he was talking nonsense.\r\nIt could not make any difference to his security where you were, because\r\nthe evil men, as he calls them, did not know of your existence. I did\r\nnot lie exactly, Lena, though I did stretch the truth till it cracked;\r\nbut the fellow seems to have an uncanny insight. He shook his head. He\r\nassured me they knew all about you. He made a horrible grimace at me."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter," said the girl. "I didn\'t want--I would not have\r\ngone."\r\n\r\nHeyst raised his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Wonderful intuition! As I continued to press him, Wang made that\r\nvery remark about you. When he smiles, his face looks like a conceited\r\ndeath\'s head. It was his very last remark that you wouldn\'t want to. I\r\nwent away then."\r\n\r\nShe leaned back against a tree. Heyst faced her in the same attitude of\r\nleisure, as if they had done with time and all the other concerns of the\r\nearth. Suddenly, high above their heads the roof of leaves whispered at\r\nthem tumultuously and then ceased.\r\n\r\n"That was a strange notion of yours, to send me away," she said. "Send\r\nme away? What for? Yes, what for?"\r\n\r\n"You seem indignant," he remarked listlessly.\r\n\r\n"To these savages, too!" she pursued. "And you think I would have gone?\r\nYou can do what you like with me--but not that, not that!"\r\n\r\nHeyst looked into the dim aisles of the forest. Everything was so still\r\nnow that the very ground on which they stood seemed to exhale silence\r\ninto the shade.\r\n\r\n"Why be indignant?" he remonstrated. "It has not happened. I gave up\r\npleading with Wang. Here we are, repulsed! Not only without power to\r\nresist the evil, but unable to make terms for ourselves with the worthy\r\nenvoys, the envoys extraordinary of the world we thought we had done\r\nwith for years and years. And that\'s bad, Lena, very bad."\r\n\r\n"It\'s funny," she said thoughtfully. "Bad? I suppose it is. I don\'t know\r\nthat it is. But do you? Do you? You talk as if you didn\'t believe in\r\nit."\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him earnestly.\r\n\r\n"Do I? Ah! That\'s it. I don\'t know how to talk. I have managed to refine\r\neverything away. I\'ve said to the Earth that bore me: \'I am I and you\r\nare a shadow.\' And, by Jove, it is so! But it appears that such words\r\ncannot be uttered with impunity. Here I am on a Shadow inhabited\r\nby Shades. How helpless a man is against the Shades! How is one to\r\nintimidate, persuade, resist, assert oneself against them? I have lost\r\nall belief in realities . . . Lena, give me your hand."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him surprised, uncomprehending.\r\n\r\n"Your hand," he cried.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed; he seized it with avidity as if eager to raise it to his\r\nlips, but halfway up released his grasp. They looked at each other for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, dear?" she whispered timidly.\r\n\r\n"Neither force nor conviction," Heyst muttered wearily to himself. "How\r\nam I to meet this charmingly simple problem?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"And so am I," he confessed quickly. "And the bitterest of this\r\nhumiliation is its complete uselessness--which I feel, I feel!"\r\n\r\nShe had never before seen him give such signs of feeling. Across his\r\nghastly face the long moustaches flamed in the shade. He spoke suddenly:\r\n\r\n"I wonder if I could find enough courage to creep among them in the\r\nnight, with a knife, and cut their throats one after another, as they\r\nslept! I wonder--"\r\n\r\nShe was frightened by his unwonted appearance more than by the words in\r\nhis mouth, and said earnestly:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you try to do such a thing! Don\'t you think of it!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t possess anything bigger than a penknife. As to thinking of it,\r\nLena, there\'s no saying what one may think of. I don\'t think. Something\r\nin me thinks--something foreign to my nature. What is the matter?"\r\n\r\nHe noticed her parted lips, and the peculiar stare in her eyes, which\r\nhad wandered from his face.\r\n\r\n"There\'s somebody after us. I saw something white moving," she cried.\r\n\r\nHeyst did not turn his head; he only glanced at her out-stretched arm.\r\n\r\n"No doubt we are followed; we are watched."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see anything now," she said.\r\n\r\n"And it does not matter," Heyst went on in his ordinary voice. "Here we\r\nare in the forest. I have neither strength nor persuasion. Indeed, it\'s\r\nextremely difficult to be eloquent before a Chinaman\'s head stuck at\r\none out of a lot of brushwood. But can we wander among these big trees\r\nindefinitely? Is this a refuge? No! What else is left to us? I did think\r\nfor a moment of the mine; but even there we could not remain very long.\r\nAnd then that gallery is not safe. The props were too weak to begin\r\nwith. Ants have been at work there--ants after the men. A death-trap, at\r\nbest. One can die but once, but there are many manners of death."\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced about fearfully, in search of the watcher or follower\r\nwhom she had glimpsed once among the trees; but if he existed, he had\r\nconcealed himself. Nothing met her eyes but the deepening shadows of the\r\nshort vistas between the living columns of the still roof of leaves.\r\nShe looked at the man beside her expectantly, tenderly, with suppressed\r\naffright and a sort of awed wonder.\r\n\r\n"I have also thought of these people\'s boat," Heyst went on. "We could\r\nget into that, and--only they have taken everything out of her. I have\r\nseen her oars and mast in a corner of their room. To shove off in an\r\nempty boat would be nothing but a desperate expedient, supposing even\r\nthat she would drift out a good distance between the islands before the\r\nmorning. It would only be a complicated manner of committing suicide--to\r\nbe found dead in a boat, dead from sun and thirst. A sea mystery.\r\nI wonder who would find us! Davidson, perhaps; but Davidson passed\r\nwestward ten days ago. I watched him steaming past one early morning,\r\nfrom the jetty."\r\n\r\n"You never told me," she said.\r\n\r\n"He must have been looking at me through his big binoculars. Perhaps, if\r\nI had raised my arm--but what did we want with Davidson then, you and\r\nI? He won\'t be back this way for three weeks or more, Lena. I wish I had\r\nraised my arm that morning."\r\n\r\n"What would have been the good of it?" she sighed out.\r\n\r\n"What good? No good, of course. We had no forebodings. This seemed to be\r\nan inexpugnable refuge, where we could live untroubled and learn to know\r\neach other."\r\n\r\n"It\'s perhaps in trouble that people get to know each other," she\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," he said indifferently. "At any rate, we would not have gone\r\naway from here with him; though I believe he would have come in eagerly\r\nenough, and ready for any service he could render. It\'s that fat man\'s\r\nnature--a delightful fellow. You would not come on the wharf that time\r\nI sent the shawl back to Mrs. Schomberg through him. He has never seen\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know that you wanted anybody ever to see me," she said.\r\n\r\nHe had folded his arms on his breast and hung his head.\r\n\r\n"And I did not know that you cared to be seen as yet. A misunderstanding\r\nevidently. An honourable misunderstanding. But it does not matter now."\r\n\r\nHe raised his head after a silence.\r\n\r\n"How gloomy this forest has grown! Yet surely the sun cannot have set\r\nalready."\r\n\r\nShe looked round; and as if her eyes had just been opened, she perceived\r\nthe shades of the forest surrounding her, not so much with gloom, but\r\nwith a sullen, dumb, menacing hostility. Her heart sank in the engulfing\r\nstillness, at that moment she felt the nearness of death, breathing on\r\nher and on the man with her. If there had been a sudden stir of leaves,\r\nthe crack of a dry branch, the faintest rustle, she would have screamed\r\naloud. But she shook off the unworthy weakness. Such as she was, a\r\nfiddle-scraping girl picked up on the very threshold of infamy, she\r\nwould try to rise above herself, triumphant and humble; and then\r\nhappiness would burst on her like a torrent, flinging at her feet the\r\nman whom she loved.\r\n\r\nHeyst stirred slightly.\r\n\r\n"We had better be getting back, Lena, since we can\'t stay all night in\r\nthe woods--or anywhere else, for that matter. We are the slaves of\r\nthis infernal surprise which has been sprung on us by--shall I say\r\nfate?--your fate, or mine."\r\n\r\nIt was the man who had broken the silence, but it was the woman who\r\nled the way. At the very edge of the forest she stopped, concealed by a\r\ntree. He joined her cautiously.\r\n\r\n"What is it? What do you see, Lena?" he whispered.\r\n\r\nShe said that it was only a thought that had come into her head. She\r\nhesitated for a moment giving him over her shoulder a shining gleam in\r\nher grey eyes. She wanted to know whether this trouble, this danger,\r\nthis evil, whatever it was, finding them out in their retreat, was not a\r\nsort of punishment.\r\n\r\n"Punishment?" repeated Heyst. He could not understand what she meant.\r\nWhen she explained, he was still more surprised. "A sort of retribution,\r\nfrom an angry Heaven?" he said in wonder. "On us? What on earth for?"\r\n\r\nHe saw her pale face darken in the dusk. She had blushed. Her whispering\r\nflowed very fast. It was the way they lived together--that wasn\'t right,\r\nwas it? It was a guilty life. For she had not been forced into it,\r\ndriven, scared into it. No, no--she had come to him of her own free\r\nwill, with her whole soul yearning unlawfully.\r\n\r\nHe was so profoundly touched that he could not speak for a moment. To\r\nconceal his trouble, he assumed his best Heystian manner.\r\n\r\n"What? Are our visitors then messengers of morality, avengers of\r\nrighteousness, agents of Providence? That\'s certainly an original view.\r\nHow flattered they would be if they could hear you!"\r\n\r\n"Now you are making fun of me," she said in a subdued voice which broke\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n"Are you conscious of sin?" Heyst asked gravely. She made no answer.\r\n"For I am not," he added; "before Heaven, I am not!"\r\n\r\n"You! You are different. Woman is the tempter. You took me up from pity.\r\nI threw myself at you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you exaggerate, you exaggerate. It was not so bad as that," he said\r\nplayfully, keeping his voice steady with an effort.\r\n\r\nHe considered himself a dead man already, yet forced to pretend that\r\nhe was alive for her sake, for her defence. He regretted that he had\r\nno Heaven to which he could recommend this fair, palpitating handful of\r\nashes and dust--warm, living sentient his own--and exposed helplessly to\r\ninsult, outrage, degradation, and infinite misery of the body.\r\n\r\nShe had averted her face from him and was still. He suddenly seized her\r\npassive hand.\r\n\r\n"You will have it so?" he said. "Yes? Well, let us then hope for mercy\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head without looking at him, like an abashed child.\r\n\r\n"Remember," he went on incorrigible with his delicate raillery, "that\r\nhope is a Christian virtue, and surely you can\'t want all the mercy for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nBefore their eyes the bungalow across the cleared ground stood bathed in\r\na sinister light. An unexpected chill gust of wind made a noise in the\r\ntree-tops. She snatched her hand away and stepped out into the open;\r\nbut before she had advanced more than three yards, she stood still and\r\npointed to the west.\r\n\r\n"Oh look there!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nBeyond the headland of Diamond Bay, lying black on a purple sea, great\r\nmasses of cloud stood piled up and bathed in a mist of blood. A crimson\r\ncrack like an open wound zigzagged between them, with a piece of dark\r\nred sun showing at the bottom. Heyst cast an indifferent glance at the\r\nill-omened chaos of the sky.\r\n\r\n"Thunderstorm making up. We shall hear it all night, but it won\'t visit\r\nus, probably. The clouds generally gather round the volcano."\r\n\r\nShe was not listening to him. Her eyes reflected the sombre and violent\r\nhues of the sunset.\r\n\r\n"That does not look much like a sign of mercy," she said slowly, as if\r\nto herself, and hurried on, followed by Heyst. Suddenly she stopped. "I\r\ndon\'t care. I would do more yet! And some day you\'ll forgive me. You\'ll\r\nhave to forgive me!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\nStumbling up the steps, as if suddenly exhausted, Lena entered the room\r\nand let herself fall on the nearest chair. Before following her, Heyst\r\ntook a survey of the surroundings from the veranda. It was a complete\r\nsolitude. There was nothing in the aspect of this familiar scene to tell\r\nhim that he and the girl were not as completely alone as they had been\r\nin the early days of their common life on this abandoned spot, with only\r\nWang discreetly materializing from time to time and the uncomplaining\r\nmemory of Morrison to keep them company.\r\n\r\nAfter the cold gust of wind there was an absolute stillness of the\r\nair. The thunder-charged mass hung unbroken beyond the low, ink-black\r\nheadland, darkening the twilight. By contrast, the sky at the zenith\r\ndisplayed pellucid clearness, the sheen of a delicate glass bubble which\r\nthe merest movement of air might shatter. A little to the left, between\r\nthe black masses of the headland and of the forest, the volcano, a\r\nfeather of smoke by day and a cigar-glow at night, took its first fiery\r\nexpanding breath of the evening. Above it a reddish star came out like\r\nan expelled spark from the fiery bosom of the earth, enchanted into\r\npermanency by the mysterious spell of frozen spaces.\r\n\r\nIn front of Heyst the forest, already full of the deepest shades, stood\r\nlike a wall. But he lingered, watching its edge, especially where it\r\nended at the line of bushes, masking the land end of the jetty. Since\r\nthe girl had spoken of catching a glimpse of something white among the\r\ntrees, he believed pretty firmly that they had been followed in their\r\nexcursion up the mountain by Mr. Jones\'s secretary. No doubt the fellow\r\nhad watched them out of the forest, and now, unless he took the trouble\r\nto go back some distance and fetch a considerable circuit inland over\r\nthe clearing, he was bound to walk out into the open space before the\r\nbungalows. Heyst did, indeed, imagine at one time some movement between\r\nthe trees, lost as soon as perceived. He stared patiently, but nothing\r\nmore happened. After all, why should he trouble about these people\'s\r\nactions? Why this stupid concern for the preliminaries, since, when\r\nthe issue was joined, it would find him disarmed and shrinking from the\r\nugliness and degradation of it?\r\n\r\nHe turned and entered the room. Deep dusk reigned in there already.\r\nLena, near the door, did not move or speak. The sheen of the white\r\ntablecloth was very obtrusive. The brute these two vagabonds had tamed\r\nhad entered on its service while Heyst and Lena were away. The table was\r\nlaid. Heyst walked up and down the room several times. The girl remained\r\nwithout sound or movement on the chair. But when Heyst, placing the two\r\nsilver candelabra on the table, struck a match to light the candles,\r\nshe got up suddenly and went into the bedroom. She came out again almost\r\nimmediately, having taken off her hat. Heyst looked at her over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the good of shirking the evil hour? I\'ve lighted these\r\ncandles for a sign of our return. After all, we might not have been\r\nwatched--while returning, I mean. Of course we were seen leaving the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nThe girl sat down again. The great wealth of her hair looked very dark\r\nabove her colourless face. She raised her eyes, glistening softly in\r\nthe light with a sort of unreadable appeal, with a strange effect of\r\nunseeing innocence.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Heyst across the table, the fingertips of one hand resting\r\non the immaculate cloth. "A creature with an antediluvian lower jaw,\r\nhairy like a mastodon, and formed like a pre-historic ape, has laid this\r\ntable. Are you awake, Lena? Am I? I would pinch myself, only I know that\r\nnothing would do away with this dream. Three covers. You know it is the\r\nshorter of the two who\'s coming--the gentleman who, in the play of his\r\nshoulders as he walks, and in his facial structure, recalls a Jaguar.\r\nAh, you don\'t know what a jaguar is? But you have had a good look at\r\nthese two. It\'s the short one, you know, who\'s to be our guest."\r\n\r\nShe made a sign with her head that she knew; Heyst\'s insistence brought\r\nRicardo vividly before her mental vision. A sudden languor, like the\r\nphysical echo of her struggle with the man, paralysed all her limbs.\r\nShe lay still in the chair, feeling very frightened at this\r\nphenomenon--ready to pray aloud for strength.\r\n\r\nHeyst had started to pace the room.\r\n\r\n"Our guest! There is a proverb--in Russia, I believe--that when a\r\nguest enters the house, God enters the house. The sacred virtue of\r\nhospitality! But it leads one into trouble as well as any other."\r\n\r\nThe girl unexpectedly got up from the chair, swaying her supple figure\r\nand stretching her arms above her head. He stopped to look at her\r\ncuriously, paused, and then went on:\r\n\r\n"I venture to think that God has nothing to do with such a hospitality\r\nand with such a guest!"\r\n\r\nShe had jumped to her feet to react against the numbness, to discover\r\nwhether her body would obey her will. It did. She could stand up, and\r\nshe could move her arms freely. Though no physiologist, she concluded\r\nthat all that sudden numbness was in her head, not in her limbs. Her\r\nfears assuaged, she thanked God for it mentally, and to Heyst murmured a\r\nprotest:\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! He\'s got to do with everything--every little thing. Nothing\r\ncan happen--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said hastily, "one of the two sparrows can\'t be struck to the\r\nground--you are thinking of that." The habitual playful smile faded on\r\nthe kindly lips under the martial moustache. "Ah, you remember what you\r\nhave been told--as a child--on Sundays."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do remember." She sank into the chair again. "It was the only\r\ndecent bit of time I ever had when I was a kid, with our landlady\'s two\r\ngirls, you know."\r\n\r\n"I wonder, Lena," Heyst said, with a return to his urbane playfulness,\r\n"whether you are just a little child, or whether you represent something\r\nas old as the world."\r\n\r\nShe surprised Heyst by saying dreamily:\r\n\r\n"Well--and what about you?"\r\n\r\n"I? I date later--much later. I can\'t call myself a child, but I am so\r\nrecent that I may call myself a man of the last hour--or is it the hour\r\nbefore last? I have been out of it so long that I am not certain how far\r\nthe hands of the clock have moved since--since--"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the portrait of his father, exactly above the head of the\r\ngirl, as if it were ignoring her in its painted austerity of feeling. He\r\ndid not finish the sentence; but he did not remain silent for long.\r\n\r\n"Only what must be avoided are fallacious inferences, my dear\r\nLena--especially at this hour."\r\n\r\n"Now you are making fun of me again," she said without looking up.\r\n\r\n"Am I?" he cried. "Making fun? No, giving warning. Hang it all, whatever\r\ntruth people told you in the old days, there is also this one--that\r\nsparrows do fall to the ground, that they are brought to the ground.\r\nThis is no vain assertion, but a fact. That\'s why"--again his\r\ntone changed, while he picked up the table knife and let it fall\r\ndisdainfully--"that\'s why I wish these wretched round knives had some\r\nedge on them. Absolute rubbish--neither edge, point, nor substance. I\r\nbelieve one of these forks would make a better weapon at a pinch. But\r\ncan I go about with a fork in my pocket?" He gnashed his teeth with a\r\nrage very real, and yet comic.\r\n\r\n"There used to be a carver here, but it was broken and thrown away a\r\nlong time ago. Nothing much to carve here. It would have made a noble\r\nweapon, no doubt; but--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The girl sat very quiet, with downcast eyes. As he kept\r\nsilence for some time, she looked up and said thoughtfully:\r\n\r\n"Yes, a knife--it\'s a knife that you would want, wouldn\'t you, in case,\r\nin case--"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"There must be a crowbar or two in the sheds; but I have given up all\r\nthe keys together. And then, do you see me walking about with a crowbar\r\nin my hand? Ha, ha! And besides, that edifying sight alone might start\r\nthe trouble for all I know. In truth, why has it not started yet?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they are afraid of you," she whispered, looking down again.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, it looks like it," he assented meditatively. "They do seem to\r\nhang back for some reason. Is that reason prudence, or downright fear,\r\nor perhaps the leisurely method of certitude?"\r\n\r\nOut in the black night, not very far from the bungalow, resounded a loud\r\nand prolonged whistle. Lena\'s hands grasped the sides of the chair, but\r\nshe made no movement. Heyst started, and turned his face away from the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe startling sound had died away.\r\n\r\n"Whistles, yells, omens, signals, portents--what do they matter?" he\r\nsaid. "But what about the crowbar? Suppose I had it! Could I stand\r\nin ambush at the side of the door--this door--and smash the first\r\nprotruding head, scatter blood and brains over the floor, over these\r\nwalls, and then run stealthily to the other door to do the same\r\nthing--and repeat the performance for a third time, perhaps? Could I? On\r\nsuspicion, without compunction, with a calm and determined purpose? No,\r\nit is not in me. I date too late. Would you like to see me attempt this\r\nthing while that mysterious prestige of mine lasts--or their not less\r\nmysterious hesitation?"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" she whispered ardently, as if compelled to speak by his\r\neyes fixed on her face. "No, it\'s a knife you want to defend yourself\r\nwith--to defend--there will be time--"\r\n\r\n"And who knows if it isn\'t really my duty?" he began again, as if he had\r\nnot heard her disjointed words at all. "It may be--my duty to you, to\r\nmyself. For why should I put up with the humiliation of their secret\r\nmenaces? Do you know what the world would say?"\r\n\r\nHe emitted a low laugh, which struck her with terror. She would have got\r\nup, but he stooped so low over her that she could not move without first\r\npushing him away.\r\n\r\n"It would say, Lena, that I--the Swede--after luring my friend and\r\npartner to his death from mere greed of money, have murdered these\r\nunoffending shipwrecked strangers from sheer funk. That would be\r\nthe story whispered--perhaps shouted--certainly spread out, and\r\nbelieved--and believed, my dear Lena!"\r\n\r\n"Who would believe such awful things?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you wouldn\'t--not at first, at any rate; but the power of\r\ncalumny grows with time. It\'s insidious and penetrating. It can even\r\ndestroy one\'s faith in oneself--dry-rot the soul."\r\n\r\nAll at once her eyes leaped to the door and remained fixed, stony, a\r\nlittle enlarged. Turning his head, Heyst beheld the figure of Ricardo\r\nframed in the doorway. For a moment none of the three moved, then,\r\nlooking from the newcomer to the girl in the chair, Heyst formulated a\r\nsardonic introduction.\r\n\r\n"Mr Ricardo, my dear."\r\n\r\nHer head drooped a little. Ricardo\'s hand went up to his moustache. His\r\nvoice exploded in the room.\r\n\r\n"At your service, ma\'am!"\r\n\r\nHe stepped in, taking his hat off with a flourish, and dropping it\r\ncarelessly on a chair near the door.\r\n\r\n"At your service," he repeated, in quite another tone. "I was made aware\r\nthere was a lady about, by that Pedro of ours; only I didn\'t know I\r\nshould have the privilege of seeing you tonight, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nLena and Heyst looked at him covertly, but he, with a vague gaze\r\navoiding them both, looked at nothing, seeming to pursue some point in\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n"Had a pleasant walk?" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. And you?" returned Heyst, who had managed to catch his glance.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been a yard away from the governor this afternoon till\r\nI started for here." The genuineness of the accent surprised Heyst,\r\nwithout convincing him of the truth of the words.\r\n\r\n"Why do you ask?" pursued Ricardo with every inflection of perfect\r\ncandour.\r\n\r\n"You might have wished to explore the island a little," said Heyst,\r\nstudying the man, who, to render him justice, did not try to free his\r\ncaptured gaze. "I may remind you that it wouldn\'t be a perfectly safe\r\nproceeding."\r\n\r\nRicardo presented a picture of innocence.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--meaning that Chink that has ran away from you. He ain\'t much!"\r\n\r\n"He has a revolver," observed Heyst meaningly.\r\n\r\n"Well, and you have a revolver, too," Mr. Ricardo argued unexpectedly.\r\n"I don\'t worry myself about that."\r\n\r\n"That\'s different. I am not afraid of you," Heyst made answer after a\r\nshort pause.\r\n\r\n"Of me?"\r\n\r\n"Of all of you."\r\n\r\n"You have a queer way of putting things," began Ricardo.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door on the compound side of the house came open with\r\nsome noise, and Pedro entered, pressing the edge of a loaded tray to his\r\nbreast. His big, hairy head rolled a little, his feet fell in front of\r\neach other with a short, hard thump on the floor. The arrival changed\r\nthe current of Ricardo\'s thought, perhaps, but certainly of his speech.\r\n\r\n"You heard me whistling a little while ago outside? That was to give him\r\na hint, as I came along, that it was time to bring in the dinner; and\r\nhere it is."\r\n\r\nLena rose and passed to the right of Ricardo, who lowered his glance for\r\na moment. They sat down at the table. The enormous gorilla back of Pedro\r\nswayed out through the door.\r\n\r\n"Extraordinary strong brute, ma\'am," said Ricardo. He, had a propensity\r\nto talk about "his Pedro," as some men will talk of their dog. "He ain\'t\r\npretty, though. No, he ain\'t pretty. And he has got to be kept under. I\r\nam his keeper, as it might be. The governor don\'t trouble his head much\r\nabout dee-tails. All that\'s left to Martin. Martin, that\'s me, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nHeyst saw the girl\'s eyes turn towards Mr. Jones\'s secretary and rest\r\nblankly on his face. Ricardo, however, looked vaguely into space,\r\nand, with faint flickers of a smile about his lips, made conversation\r\nindefatigably against the silence of his entertainers. He boasted\r\nlargely of his long association with Mr. Jones--over four years now, he\r\nsaid. Then, glancing rapidly at Heyst:\r\n\r\n"You can see at once he\'s a gentleman, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"You people," Heyst said, his habitual playful intonation tinged with\r\ngloom, "are divorced from all reality in my eyes."\r\n\r\nRicardo received this speech as if he had been expecting to hear\r\nthose very words, or else did not mind at all what Heyst might say.\r\nHe muttered an absent-minded "Ay, ay," played with a bit of biscuit,\r\nsighed, and said, with a peculiar stare which did not seem to carry any\r\ndistance, but to stop short at a point in the air very near his face:\r\n\r\n"Anybody can see at once you are one. You and the governor ought to\r\nunderstand each other. He expects to see you tonight. The governor isn\'t\r\nwell, and we\'ve got to think of getting away from here."\r\n\r\nWhile saying these words he turned himself full towards Lena, but\r\nwithout any marked expression. Leaning back with folded arms, the girl\r\nstared before her as if she had been alone in the room. But under\r\nthat aspect of almost vacant unconcern the perils and emotion that had\r\nentered into her life warmed her heart, exalted her mind with a sense of\r\nan inconceivable intensity of existence.\r\n\r\n"Really? Thinking of going away from here?" Heyst murmured.\r\n\r\n"The best of friends must part," Ricardo pronounced slowly. "And, as\r\nlong as they part friends, there\'s no harm done. We two are used to be\r\non the move. You, I understand, prefer to stick in one place."\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that all this was being said merely for the sake of\r\ntalking, and that Ricardo\'s mind was concentrated on some purpose\r\nunconnected with the words that were coming out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n"I should like to know," Heyst asked with incisive politeness, "how you\r\nhave come to understand this or anything else about me? As far as I can\r\nremember, I\'ve made you no confidences."\r\n\r\nRicardo, gazing comfortably into space out of the back of his chair--for\r\nsome time all three had given up any pretence of eating--answered\r\nabstractedly:\r\n\r\n"Any fellow might have guessed it!" He sat up suddenly, and uncovered\r\nall his teeth in a grin of extraordinary ferocity, which was belied by\r\nthe persistent amiability of his tone. "The governor will be the man\r\nto tell you something about that. I wish you would say you would see my\r\ngovernor. He\'s the one who does all our talking. Let me take you to him\r\nthis evening. He ain\'t at all well; and he can\'t make up his mind to go\r\naway without having a talk with you."\r\n\r\nHeyst, looking up, met Lena\'s eyes. Their expression of candour seemed\r\nto hide some struggling intention. Her head, he fancied, had made an\r\nimperceptible affirmative movement. Why? What reason could she have? Was\r\nit the prompting of some obscure instinct? Or was it simply a delusion\r\nof his own senses? But in this strange complication invading the\r\nquietude of his life, in his state of doubt and disdain and almost of\r\ndespair with which he looked at himself, he would let even a delusive\r\nappearance guide him through a darkness so dense that it made for\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n"Well, suppose I do say so."\r\n\r\nRicardo did not conceal his satisfaction, which for a moment interested\r\nHeyst.\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be my life they are after," he said to himself. "What good\r\ncould it be to them?"\r\n\r\nHe looked across the table at the girl. What did it matter whether she\r\nhad nodded or not? As always when looking into her unconscious eyes, he\r\ntasted something like the dregs of tender pity. He had decided to go.\r\nHer nod, imaginary or not imaginary, advice or illusion, had tipped the\r\nscale. He reflected that Ricardo\'s invitation could scarcely be anything\r\nin the nature of a trap. It would have been too absurd. Why carry subtly\r\ninto a trap someone already bound hand and foot, as it were?\r\n\r\nAll this time he had been looking fixedly at the girl he called Lena. In\r\nthe submissive quietness of her being, which had been her attitude ever\r\nsince they had begun their life on the island, she remained as secret\r\nas ever. Heyst got up abruptly, with a smile of such enigmatic and\r\ndespairing character that Mr. Secretary Ricardo, whose abstract gaze had\r\nan all-round efficiency, made a slight crouching start, as if to dive\r\nunder the table for his leg-knife--a start that was repressed, as soon\r\nas begun. He had expected Heyst to spring on him or draw a revolver,\r\nbecause he created for himself a vision of him in his own image. Instead\r\nof doing either of these obvious things, Heyst walked across the\r\nroom, opened the door and put his head through it to look out into the\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his back was turned, Ricardo\'s hand sought the girl\'s arm\r\nunder the table. He was not looking at her, but she felt the groping,\r\nnervous touch of his search, felt suddenly the grip of his fingers above\r\nher wrist. He leaned forward a little; still he dared not look at her.\r\nHis hard stare remained fastened on Heyst\'s back. In an extremely low\r\nhiss, his fixed idea of argument found expression scathingly:\r\n\r\n"See! He\'s no good. He\'s not the man for you!"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her at last. Her lips moved a little, and he was awed\r\nby that movement without a sound. Next instant the hard grasp of his\r\nfingers vanished from her arm. Heyst had shut the door. On his way back\r\nto the table, he crossed the path of the girl they had called Alma--she\r\ndidn\'t know why--also Magdalen, whose mind had remained so long in doubt\r\nas to the reason of her own existence. She no longer wondered at that\r\nbitter riddle, since her heart found its solution in a blinding, hot\r\nglow of passionate purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\nShe passed by Heyst as if she had indeed been blinded by some secret,\r\nlurid, and consuming glare into which she was about to enter. The\r\ncurtain of the bedroom door fell behind her into rigid folds. Ricardo\'s\r\nvacant gaze seemed to be watching the dancing flight of a fly in mid\r\nair.\r\n\r\n"Extra dark outside, ain\'t it?" he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Not so dark but that I could see that man of yours prowling about\r\nthere," said Heyst in measured tones.\r\n\r\n"What--Pedro? He\'s scarcely a man you know; or else I wouldn\'t be so\r\nfond of him as I am."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Let\'s call him your worthy associate."\r\n\r\n"Ay! Worthy enough for what we want of him. A great standby is Peter in\r\na scrimmage. A growl and a bite--oh, my! And you don\'t want him about?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"You want him out of the way?" insisted Ricardo with an affectation\r\nof incredulity which Heyst accepted calmly, though the air in the room\r\nseemed to grow more oppressive with every word spoken.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it. I do want him out of the way." He forced himself to speak\r\nequably.\r\n\r\n"Lor\'! That\'s no great matter. Pedro\'s not much use here. The business\r\nmy governor\'s after can be settled by ten minutes\' rational talk\r\nwith--with another gentleman. Quiet talk!"\r\n\r\nHe looked up suddenly with hard, phosphorescent eyes. Heyst didn\'t move\r\na muscle. Ricardo congratulated himself on having left his revolver\r\nbehind. He was so exasperated that he didn\'t know what he might have\r\ndone. He said at last:\r\n\r\n"You want poor, harmless Peter out of the way before you let me take you\r\nto see the governor--is that it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is it."\r\n\r\n"H\'m! One can see," Ricardo said with hidden venom, "that you are a\r\ngentleman; but all that gentlemanly fancifulness is apt to turn sour on\r\na plain man\'s stomach. However--you\'ll have to pardon me."\r\n\r\nHe put his fingers into his mouth and let out a whistle which seemed to\r\ndrive a thin, sharp shaft of air solidly against one\'s nearest ear-drum.\r\nThough he greatly enjoyed Heyst\'s involuntary grimace, he sat perfectly\r\nstolid waiting for the effect of the call.\r\n\r\nIt brought Pedro in with an extraordinary, uncouth, primeval\r\nimpetuosity. The door flew open with a clatter, and the wild figure it\r\ndisclosed seemed anxious to devastate the room in leaps and bounds;\r\nbut Ricardo raised his open palm, and the creature came in quietly.\r\nHis enormous half-closed paws swung to and fro a little in front of his\r\nbowed trunk as he walked. Ricardo looked on truculently.\r\n\r\n"You go to the boat--understand? Go now!"\r\n\r\nThe little red eyes of the tame monster blinked with painful attention\r\nin the mass of hair.\r\n\r\n"Well? Why don\'t you get? Forgot human speech, eh? Don\'t you know any\r\nlonger what a boat is?"\r\n\r\n"Si--boat," the creature stammered out doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Well, go there--the boat at the jetty. March off to it and sit there,\r\nlie down there, do anything but go to sleep there--till you hear my\r\ncall, and then fly here. Them\'s your orders. March! Get, vamos! No, not\r\nthat way--out through the front door. No sulks!"\r\n\r\nPedro obeyed with uncouth alacrity. When he had gone, the gleam of\r\npitiless savagery went out of Ricardo\'s yellow eyes, and his physiognomy\r\ntook on, for the first time that evening, the expression of a domestic\r\ncat which is being noticed.\r\n\r\n"You can watch him right into the bushes, if you like. Too dark, eh? Why\r\nnot go with him to the very spot, then?"\r\n\r\nHeyst made a gesture of vague protest.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing to assure me that he will stay there. I have no doubt\r\nof his going, but it\'s an act without guarantee."\r\n\r\n"There you are!" Ricardo shrugged his shoulders philosophically. "Can\'t\r\nbe helped. Short of shooting our Pedro, nobody can make absolutely sure\r\nof his staying in the same place longer than he has a mind to; but I\r\ntell you, he lives in holy terror of my temper. That\'s why I put on my\r\nsudden-death air when I talk to him. And yet I wouldn\'t shoot him--not\r\nI, unless in such a fit of rage as would make a man shoot his favourite\r\ndog. Look here, sir! This deal is on the square. I didn\'t tip him a wink\r\nto do anything else. He won\'t budge from the jetty. Are you coming along\r\nnow, sir?"\r\n\r\nA short-silence ensued. Ricardo\'s jaws were working ominously under his\r\nskin. His eyes glided: voluptuously here and there, cruel and dreamy,\r\nHeyst checked a sudden movement, reflected for a while, then said:\r\n\r\n"You must wait a little."\r\n\r\n"Wait a little! Wait a little! What does he think a fellow is--a graven\r\nimage?" grumbled Ricardo half audibly.\r\n\r\nHeyst went into the bedroom, and shut the door after him with a bang.\r\nComing from the light, he could not see a thing in there at first; yet\r\nhe received the impression of the girl getting up from the floor. On\r\nthe less opaque darkness of the shutter-hole, her head detached itself\r\nsuddenly, very faint, a mere hint of a round, dark shape without a face.\r\n\r\n"I am going, Lena. I am going to confront these scoundrels." He was\r\nsurprised to feel two arms falling on his shoulders. "I thought that\r\nyou--" he began.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" the girl whispered hastily.\r\n\r\nShe neither clung to him, nor yet did she try to draw him to her. Her\r\nhands grasped his shoulders, and she seemed to him to be staring into\r\nhis face in the dark. And now he could see something of her face,\r\ntoo--an oval without features--and faintly distinguish her person, in\r\nthe blackness, a form without definite lines.\r\n\r\n"You have a black dress here, haven\'t you, Lena?" he asked, speaking\r\nrapidly, and so low that she could just hear him.\r\n\r\n"Yes--an old thing."\r\n\r\n"Very good. Put it on at once."\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\n"Not for mourning!" There was something peremptory in the slightly\r\nironic murmur. "Can you find it and get into it in the dark?"\r\n\r\nShe could. She would try. He waited, very still. He could imagine\r\nher movements over there at the far end of the room; but his eyes,\r\naccustomed now to the darkness, had lost her completely. When she spoke,\r\nher voice surprised him by its nearness. She had done what he had told\r\nher to do, and had approached him, invisible.\r\n\r\n"Good! Where\'s that piece of purple veil I\'ve seen lying about?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, only a slight rustle.\r\n\r\n"Where is it?" he repeated impatiently.\r\n\r\nHer unexpected breath was on his cheek.\r\n\r\n"In my hands."\r\n\r\n"Capital! Listen, Lena. As soon as I leave the bungalow with that\r\nhorrible scoundrel, you slip out at the back--instantly, lose no\r\ntime!--and run round into the forest. That will be your time, while we\r\nare walking away, and I am sure he won\'t give me the slip. Run into the\r\nforest behind the fringe of bushes between the big trees. You will know,\r\nsurely, how to find a place in full view of the front door. I fear for\r\nyou; but in this black dress, with most of your face muffled up in that\r\ndark veil, I defy anybody to find you there before daylight. Wait in the\r\nforest till the table is pushed into full view of the doorway, and you\r\nsee three candles out of four blown out and one relighted--or, should\r\nthe lights be put out here while you watch them, wait till three candles\r\nare lighted and then two put out. At either of these signals run back as\r\nhard as you can, for it will mean that I am waiting for you here."\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, the girl had sought and seized one of his\r\nhands. She did not press it; she held it loosely, as it were timidly,\r\ncaressingly. It was no grasp; it was a mere contact, as if only to make\r\nsure that he was there, that he was real and no mere darker shadow in\r\nthe obscurity. The warmth of her hand gave Heyst a strange, intimate\r\nsensation of all her person. He had to fight down a new sort of emotion,\r\nwhich almost unmanned him. He went on, whispering sternly:\r\n\r\n"But if you see no such signals, don\'t let anything--fear, curiosity,\r\ndespair, or hope--entice you back to this house; and with the first sign\r\nof dawn steal away along the edge of the clearing till you strike the\r\npath. Wait no longer, because I shall probably be dead."\r\n\r\nThe murmur of the word "Never!" floated into his ear as if it formed\r\nitself in the air.\r\n\r\n"You know the path," he continued. "Make your way to the barricade. Go\r\nto Wang--yes, to Wang. Let nothing stop you!" It seemed to him that the\r\ngirl\'s hand trembled a little. "The worst he can do to you is to shoot\r\nyou, but he won\'t. I really think he won\'t, if I am not there. Stay with\r\nthe villagers, with the wild people, and fear nothing. They will be more\r\nawed by you than you can be frightened of them. Davidson\'s bound to turn\r\nup before very long. Keep a look-out for a passing steamer. Think of\r\nsome sort of signal to call him."\r\n\r\nShe made no answer. The sense of the heavy, brooding silence in the\r\noutside world seemed to enter and fill the room--the oppressive infinity\r\nof it, without breath, without light. It was as if the heart of hearts\r\nhad ceased to beat and the end of all things had come.\r\n\r\n"Have you understood? You are to run out of the house at once," Heyst\r\nwhispered urgently.\r\n\r\nShe lifted his hand to her lips and let it go. He was startled.\r\n\r\n"Lena!" he cried out under his breath.\r\n\r\nShe was gone from his side. He dared not trust himself--no, not even to\r\nthe extent of a tender word.\r\n\r\nTurning to go out he heard a thud somewhere in the house. To open the\r\ndoor, he had first to lift the curtain; he did so with his face over his\r\nshoulder. The merest trickle of light, coming through the keyhole and\r\none or two cracks, was enough for his eyes to see her plainly, all\r\nblack, down on her knees, with her head and arms flung on the foot of\r\nthe bed--all black in the desolation of a mourning sinner. What was\r\nthis? A suspicion that there were everywhere more things than he\r\ncould understand crossed Heyst\'s mind. Her arm, detached from the bed,\r\nmotioned him away. He obeyed, and went out, full of disquiet.\r\n\r\nThe curtain behind him had not ceased to tremble when she was up on her\r\nfeet, close against it, listening for sounds, for words, in a stooping,\r\ntragic attitude of stealthy attention, one hand clutching at her breast\r\nas if to compress, to make less loud the beating of her heart. Heyst\r\nhad caught Mr. Jones\'s secretary in the contemplation of his closed\r\nwriting-desk. Ricardo might have been meditating how to break into it;\r\nbut when he turned about suddenly, he showed so distorted a face that\r\nit made Heyst pause in wonder at the upturned whites of the eyes, which\r\nwere blinking horribly, as if the man were inwardly convulsed.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were never coming," Ricardo mumbled.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you were pressed for time. Even if your going away\r\ndepends on this conversation, as you say, I doubt if you are the men to\r\nput to sea on such a night as this," said Heyst, motioning Ricardo to\r\nprecede him out of the house.\r\n\r\nWith feline undulations of hip and shoulder, the secretary left the\r\nroom at once. There was something cruel in the absolute dumbness of the\r\nnight. The great cloud covering half the sky hung right against one,\r\nlike an enormous curtain hiding menacing preparations of violence. As\r\nthe feet of the two men touched the ground, a rumble came from behind\r\nit, preceded by a swift, mysterious gleam of light on the waters of the\r\nbay.\r\n\r\n"Ha!" said Ricardo. "It begins."\r\n\r\n"It may be nothing in the end," observed Heyst, stepping along steadily.\r\n\r\n"No! Let it come!" Ricardo said viciously. "I am in the humour for it!"\r\n\r\nBy the time the two men had reached the other bungalow, the far-off\r\nmodulated rumble growled incessantly, while pale lightning in waves of\r\ncold fire flooded and ran off the island in rapid succession. Ricardo,\r\nunexpectedly, dashed ahead up the steps and put his head through the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n"Here he is, governor! Keep him with you as long as you can--till you\r\nhear me whistle. I am on the track."\r\n\r\nHe flung these words into the room with inconceivable speed, and stood\r\naside to let the visitor pass through the doorway; but he had to wait\r\nan appreciable moment, because Heyst, seeing his purpose, had scornfully\r\nslowed his pace. When Heyst entered the room it was with a smile, the\r\nHeyst smile, lurking under his martial moustache.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\nTwo candles were burning on the stand-up desk. Mr. Jones, tightly\r\nenfolded in an old but gorgeous blue silk dressing-gown, kept his\r\nelbows close against his sides and his hands deeply plunged into the\r\nextraordinarily deep pockets of the garment. The costume accentuated his\r\nemaciation. He resembled a painted pole leaning against the edge of the\r\ndesk, with a dried head of dubious distinction stuck on the top of it.\r\nRicardo lounged in the doorway. Indifferent in appearance to what\r\nwas going on, he was biding his time. At a given moment, between two\r\nflickers of lightning, he melted out of his frame into the outer\r\nair. His disappearance was observed on the instant by Mr. Jones, who\r\nabandoned his nonchalant immobility against the desk, and made a few\r\nsteps calculated to put him between Heyst and the doorway.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awfully close," he remarked\r\n\r\nHeyst, in the middle of the room, had made up his mind to speak plainly.\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t met to talk about the weather. You favoured me earlier in\r\nthe day with a rather cryptic phrase about yourself. \'I am he that is,\'\r\nyou said. What does that mean?"\r\n\r\nMr. Jones, without looking at Heyst, continued his absentminded\r\nmovements till, attaining the desired position, he brought his shoulders\r\nwith a thump against the wall near the door, and raised his head. In\r\nthe emotion of the decisive moment his haggard face glistened with\r\nperspiration. Drops ran down his hollow cheeks and almost blinded the\r\nspectral eyes in their bony caverns.\r\n\r\n"It means that I am a person to be reckoned with. No--stop! Don\'t put\r\nyour hand into your pocket--don\'t."\r\n\r\nHis voice had a wild, unexpected shrillness. Heyst started, and there\r\nensued a moment of suspended animation, during which the thunder\'s\r\ndeep bass muttered distantly and the doorway to the right of Mr. Jones\r\nflickered with bluish light. At last Heyst shrugged his shoulders; he\r\neven looked at his hand. He didn\'t put it in his pocket, however. Mr.\r\nJones, glued against the wall, watched him raise both his hands to\r\nthe ends of his horizontal moustaches, and answered the note of\r\ninterrogation in his steady eyes.\r\n\r\n"A matter of prudence," said Mr. Jones in his natural hollow tones, and\r\nwith a face of deathlike composure. "A man of your free life has surely\r\nperceived that. You are a much talked-about man, Mr. Heyst--and though,\r\nas far as I understand, you are accustomed to employ the subtler\r\nweapons of intelligence, still I can\'t afford to take any risks of\r\nthe--er--grosser methods. I am not unscrupulous enough to be a match for\r\nyou in the use of intelligence; but I assure you, Mr. Heyst, that in\r\nthe other way you are no match for me. I have you covered at this\r\nvery moment. You have been covered ever since you entered this room.\r\nYes--from my pocket."\r\n\r\nDuring this harangue Heyst looked deliberately over his shoulder,\r\nstepped back a pace, and sat down on the end of the camp bedstead.\r\nLeaning his elbow on one knee, he laid his cheek in the palm of his hand\r\nand seemed to meditate on what he should say next. Mr. Jones, planted\r\nagainst the wall, was obviously waiting for some sort of overture.\r\nAs nothing came, he resolved to speak himself; but he hesitated. For,\r\nthough he considered that the most difficult step had been taken, he\r\nsaid to himself that every stage of progress required great caution,\r\nlest the man in Ricardo\'s phraseology, should "start to prance"--which\r\nwould be most inconvenient. He fell back on a previous statement:\r\n\r\n"And I am a person to be reckoned with."\r\n\r\nThe other man went on looking at the floor, as if he were alone in the\r\nroom. There was a pause.\r\n\r\n"You have heard of me, then?" Heyst said at length, looking up.\r\n\r\n"I should think so! We have been staying at Schomberg\'s hotel."\r\n\r\n"Schom--" Heyst choked on the word.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Mr. Heyst?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. Nausea," Heyst said resignedly. He resumed his former attitude\r\nof meditative indifference. "What is this reckoning you are talking\r\nabout?" he asked after a time, in the quietest possible tone. "I don\'t\r\nknow you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s obvious that we belong to the same--social sphere," began Mr.\r\nJones with languid irony. Inwardly he was as watchful as he could be.\r\n"Something has driven you out--the originality of your ideas, perhaps.\r\nOr your tastes."\r\n\r\nMr Jones indulged in one of his ghastly smiles. In repose his features\r\nhad a curious character of evil, exhausted austerity; but when he\r\nsmiled, the whole mask took on an unpleasantly infantile expression. A\r\nrecrudescence of the rolling thunder invaded the room loudly, and passed\r\ninto silence.\r\n\r\n"You are not taking this very well," observed Mr. Jones. This was\r\nwhat he said, but as a matter of fact he thought that the business\r\nwas shaping quite satisfactorily. The man, he said to himself, had no\r\nstomach for a fight. Aloud he continued: "Come! You can\'t expect to have\r\nit always your own way. You are a man of the world."\r\n\r\n"And you?" Heyst interrupted him unexpectedly. "How do you define\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"I, my dear sir? In one way I am--yes, I am the world itself, come to\r\npay you a visit. In another sense I am an outcast--almost an outlaw.\r\nIf you prefer a less materialistic view, I am a sort of fate--the\r\nretribution that waits its time."\r\n\r\n"I wish to goodness you were the commonest sort of ruffian!" said Heyst,\r\nraising his equable gaze to Mr. Jones. "One would be able to talk to you\r\nstraight then, and hope for some humanity. As it is--"\r\n\r\n"I dislike violence and ferocity of every sort as much as you do," Mr.\r\nJones declared, looking very languid as he leaned against the wall, but\r\nspeaking fairly loud. "You can ask my Martin if it is not so. This, Mr.\r\nHeyst, is a soft age. It is also an age without prejudices. I\'ve heard\r\nthat you are free from them yourself. You mustn\'t be shocked if I tell\r\nyou plainly that we are after your money--or I am, if you prefer to make\r\nme alone responsible. Pedro, of course, knows no more of it than\r\nany other animal would. Ricardo is of the faithful-retainer\r\nclass--absolutely identified with all my ideas, wishes, and even whims!"\r\n\r\nMr Jones pulled his left hand out of his pocket, got a handkerchief out\r\nof another, and began to wipe the perspiration from his forehead, neck,\r\nand chin. The excitement from which he suffered made his breathing\r\nvisible. In his long dressing-gown he had the air of a convalescent\r\ninvalid who had imprudently overtaxed his strength. Heyst,\r\nbroad-shouldered, robust, watched the operation from the end of the camp\r\nbedstead, very calm, his hands on his knees.\r\n\r\n"And by the by," he asked, "where is he now, that henchman of yours?\r\nBreaking into my desk?"\r\n\r\n"That would be crude. Still, crudeness is one of life\'s conditions."\r\nThere was the slightest flavour of banter in the tone of Ricardo\'s\r\ngovernor. "Conceivable, but unlikely. Martin is a little crude; but you\r\nare not, Mr. Heyst. To tell you the truth, I don\'t know precisely\r\nwhere he is. He has been a little mysterious of late; but he has my\r\nconfidence. No, don\'t get up, Mr. Heyst!"\r\n\r\nThe viciousness of his spectral face was indescribable. Heyst, who had\r\nmoved a little, was surprised by the disclosure.\r\n\r\n"It was not my intention," he said.\r\n\r\n"Pray remain seated," Mr. Jones insisted in a languid voice, but with a\r\nvery determined glitter in his black eye-caverns.\r\n\r\n"If you were more observant," said Heyst with dispassionate contempt,\r\n"you would have known before I had been five minutes in the room that I\r\nhad no weapon of any sort on me."\r\n\r\n"Possibly; but pray keep your hands still. They are very well where they\r\nare. This is too big an affair for me to take any risks."\r\n\r\n"Big? Too big?" Heyst repeated with genuine surprise. "Good Heavens!\r\nWhatever you are looking for, there\'s very little of it here--very\r\nlittle of anything."\r\n\r\n"You would naturally say so, but that\'s not what we have heard,"\r\nretorted Mr. Jones quickly, with a grin so ghastly that it was\r\nimpossible to think it voluntary.\r\n\r\nHeyst\'s face had grown very gloomy. He knitted his brows.\r\n\r\n"What have you heard?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"A lot, Mr. Heyst--a lot," affirmed Mr. Jones. He was vying to recover\r\nhis manner of languid superiority. "We have heard, for instance, of a\r\ncertain Mr. Morrison, once your partner."\r\n\r\nHeyst could not repress a slight movement.\r\n\r\n"Aha!" said Mr. Jones, with a sort of ghostly glee on his face.\r\n\r\nThe muffled thunder resembled the echo of a distant cannonade below the\r\nhorizon, and the two men seemed to be listening to it in sullen silence.\r\n\r\n"This diabolical calumny will end in actually and literally taking my\r\nlife from me," thought Heyst.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he laughed. Portentously spectral, Mr. Jones frowned at\r\nthe sound.\r\n\r\n"Laugh as much as you please," he said. "I, who have been hounded out\r\nfrom society by a lot of highly moral souls, can\'t see anything funny in\r\nthat story. But here we are, and you will now have to pay for your fun,\r\nMr. Heyst."\r\n\r\n"You have heard a lot of ugly lies," observed Heyst. "Take my word for\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"You would say so, of course--very natural. As a matter of fact I\r\nhaven\'t heard very much. Strictly speaking, it was Martin. He collects\r\ninformation, and so on. You don\'t suppose I would talk to that Schomberg\r\nanimal more than I could help? It was Martin whom he took into his\r\nconfidence."\r\n\r\n"The stupidity of that creature is so great that it becomes formidable,"\r\nHeyst said, as if speaking to himself.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily, his mind turned to the girl, wandering in the forest,\r\nalone and terrified. Would he ever see her again? At that thought he\r\nnearly lost his self-possession. But the idea that if she followed\r\nhis instructions those men were not likely to find her steadied him a\r\nlittle. They did not know that the island had any inhabitants; and he\r\nhimself once disposed of, they would be too anxious to get away to waste\r\ntime hunting for a vanished girl.\r\n\r\nAll this passed through Heyst\'s mind in a flash, as men think in moments\r\nof danger. He looked speculatively at Mr. Jones, who, of course, had\r\nnever for a moment taken his eyes from his intended victim. And, the\r\nconviction came to Heyst that this outlaw from the higher spheres was an\r\nabsolutely hard and pitiless scoundrel.\r\n\r\nMr Jones\'s voice made him start.\r\n\r\n"It would be useless, for instance, to tell me that your Chinaman has\r\nrun off with your money. A man living alone with a Chinaman on an island\r\ntakes care to conceal property of that kind so well that the devil\r\nhimself--"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," Heyst muttered.\r\n\r\nAgain, with his left hand, Mr. Jones mopped his frontal bone, his\r\nstalk-like neck, his razor jaws, his fleshless chin. Again his voice\r\nfaltered and his aspect became still more gruesomely malevolent as of a\r\nwicked and pitiless corpse.\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean," he cried, "but you mustn\'t put too much trust\r\nin your ingenuity. You don\'t strike me as a very ingenious person, Mr.\r\nHeyst. Neither am I. My talents lie another way. But Martin--"\r\n\r\n"Who is now engaged in rifling my desk," interjected Heyst.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so. What I was going to say is that Martin is much\r\ncleverer than a Chinaman. Do you believe in racial superiority, Mr.\r\nHeyst? I do, firmly. Martin is great at ferreting out such secrets as\r\nyours, for instance."\r\n\r\n"Secrets like mine!" repeated Heyst bitterly. "Well I wish him joy of\r\nall he can ferret out!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s very kind of you," remarked Mr. Jones. He was beginning to\r\nbe anxious for Martin\'s return. Of iron self-possession at the\r\ngaming-table, fearless in a sudden affray, he found that this rather\r\nspecial kind of work was telling on his nerves. "Keep still as you are!"\r\nhe cried sharply.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve told you I am not armed," said Heyst, folding his arms on his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n"I am really inclined to believe that you are not," admitted Mr. Jones\r\nseriously. "Strange!" he mused aloud, the caverns of his eyes turned\r\nupon Heyst. Then briskly: "But my object is to keep you in this room.\r\nDon\'t provoke me, by some unguarded movement, to smash your knee or do\r\nsomething definite of that sort." He passed his tongue over his lips,\r\nwhich were dry and black, while his forehead glistened with moisture. "I\r\ndon\'t know if it wouldn\'t be better to do it at once!"\r\n\r\n"He who deliberates is lost," said Heyst with grave mockery.\r\n\r\nMr Jones disregarded the remark. He had the air of communing with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Physically I am no match for you," he said slowly, his black gaze fixed\r\nupon the man sitting on the end of the bed. "You could spring--"\r\n\r\n"Are you trying to frighten yourself?" asked Heyst abruptly. "You don\'t\r\nseem to have quite enough pluck for your business. Why don\'t you do it\r\nat once?"\r\n\r\nMr Jones, taking violent offence, snorted like a savage skeleton.\r\n\r\n"Strange as it may seem to you, it is because of my origin, my breeding,\r\nmy traditions, my early associations, and such-like trifles. Not\r\neverybody can divest himself of the prejudices of a gentleman as easily\r\nas you have done, Mr. Heyst. But don\'t worry about my pluck. If you were\r\nto make a clean spring at me, you would receive in mid air, so to speak,\r\nsomething that would make you perfectly harmless by the time you landed.\r\nNo, don\'t misapprehend us, Mr. Heyst. We are--er--adequate bandits; and\r\nwe are after the fruit of your labours as a--er--successful swindler.\r\nIt\'s the way of the world--gorge and disgorge!"\r\n\r\nHe leaned wearily the back of his head against the wall. His vitality\r\nseemed exhausted. Even his sunken eyelids drooped within the bony\r\nsockets. Only his thin, waspish, beautifully pencilled eyebrows, drawn\r\ntogether a little, suggested the will and the power to sting--something\r\nvicious, unconquerable, and deadly.\r\n\r\n"Fruits! Swindler!" repeated Heyst, without heat, almost without\r\ncontempt. "You are giving yourself no end of trouble, you and your\r\nfaithful henchman, to crack an empty nut. There are no fruits here, as\r\nyou imagine. There are a few sovereigns, which you may have if you like;\r\nand since you have called yourself a bandit--"\r\n\r\n"Yaas!" drawled Mr. Jones. "That, rather than a swindler. Open warfare\r\nat least!"\r\n\r\n"Very good! Only let me tell you that there were never in the world two\r\nmore deluded bandits--never!"\r\n\r\nHeyst uttered these words with such energy that Mr. Jones, stiffening\r\nup, seemed to become thinner and taller in his metallic blue\r\ndressing-gown against the whitewashed wall.\r\n\r\n"Fooled by a silly, rascally innkeeper!" Heyst went on. "Talked over\r\nlike a pair of children with a promise of sweets!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t talk with that disgusting animal," muttered Mr. Jones\r\nsullenly; "but he convinced Martin, who is no fool."\r\n\r\n"I should think he wanted very much to be convinced," said Heyst, with\r\nthe courteous intonation so well known in the Islands. "I don\'t want to\r\ndisturb your touching trust in your--your follower, but he must be the\r\nmost credulous brigand in existence. What do you imagine? If the story\r\nof my riches were ever so true, do you think Schomberg would have\r\nimparted it to you from sheer altruism? Is that the way of the world,\r\nMr. Jones?"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the lower jaw of Ricardo\'s gentleman dropped; but it came\r\nup with a snap of scorn, and he said with spectral intensity:\r\n\r\n"The beast is cowardly! He was frightened, and wanted to get rid of\r\nus, if you want to know, Mr. Heyst. I don\'t know that the material\r\ninducement was so very great, but I was bored, and we decided to accept\r\nthe bribe. I don\'t regret it. All my life I have been seeking new\r\nimpressions, and you have turned out to be something quite out of\r\nthe common. Martin, of course, looks to the material results. He\'s\r\nsimple--and faithful--and wonderfully acute."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! He\'s on the track--" and now Heyst\'s speech had the character\r\nof politely grim raillery--"but not sufficiently on the track, as\r\nyet, to make it quite convenient to shoot me without more ado. Didn\'t\r\nSchomberg tell you precisely where I conceal the fruit of my rapines?\r\nPah! Don\'t you know he would have told you anything, true or false, from\r\na very clear motive? Revenge! Mad hate--the unclean idiot!"\r\n\r\nMr Jones did not seem very much moved. On his right hand the doorway\r\nincessantly flickered with distant lightning, and the continuous rumble\r\nof thunder went on irritatingly, like the growl of an inarticulate giant\r\nmuttering fatuously.\r\n\r\nHeyst overcame his immense repugnance to allude to her whose image,\r\ncowering in the forest was constantly before his eyes, with all the\r\npathos and force of its appeal, august, pitiful, and almost holy to him.\r\nIt was in a hurried, embarrassed manner that he went on:\r\n\r\n"If it had not been for that girl whom he persecuted with his insane and\r\nodious passion, and who threw herself on my protection, he would never\r\nhave--but you know well enough!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know!" burst out Mr. Jones with amazing heat. "That\r\nhotel-keeper tried to talk to me once of some girl he had lost, but I\r\ntold him I didn\'t want to hear any of his beastly women stories. It had\r\nsomething to do with you, had it?"\r\n\r\nHeyst looked on serenely at this outburst, then lost his patience a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n"What sort of comedy is this? You don\'t mean to say that you didn\'t know\r\nthat I had--that there was a girl living with me here?"\r\n\r\nOne could see that the eyes of Mr. Jones had become fixed in the depths\r\nof their black holes by the gleam of white becoming steady there. The\r\nwhole man seemed frozen still.\r\n\r\n"Here! Here!" he screamed out twice. There was no mistaking his\r\nastonishment, his shocked incredulity--something like frightened\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nHeyst was disgusted also, but in another way. He too was incredulous.\r\nHe regretted having mentioned the girl; but the thing was done, his\r\nrepugnance had been overcome in the heat of his argument against the\r\nabsurd bandit.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that you didn\'t know of that significant fact?" he\r\ninquired. "Of the only effective truth in the welter of silly lies that\r\ndeceived you so easily?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t!" Mr. Jones shouted. "But Martin did!" he added in a faint\r\nwhisper, which Heyst\'s ears just caught and no more.\r\n\r\n"I kept her out of sight as long as I could," said Heyst. "Perhaps, with\r\nyour bringing up, traditions, and so on; you will understand my reason\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\n"He knew. He knew before!" Mr. Jones mourned in a hollow voice. "He knew\r\nof her from the first!"\r\n\r\nBacked hard against the wall he no longer watched Heyst. He had the air\r\nof a man who had seen an abyss yawning under his feet.\r\n\r\n"If I want to kill him, this is my time," thought Heyst; but he did not\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nNext moment Mr. Jones jerked his head up, glaring with sardonic fury.\r\n\r\n"I have a good mind to shoot you, you woman-ridden hermit, you man in\r\nthe moon, that can\'t exist without--no, it won\'t be you that I\'ll shoot.\r\nIt\'s the other woman-lover--the prevaricating, sly, low-class, amorous\r\ncuss! And he shaved--shaved under my very nose. I\'ll shoot him!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone mad," thought Heyst, startled by the spectre\'s sudden fury.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself more in danger, nearer death, than ever since he had\r\nentered that room. An insane bandit is a deadly combination. He did not,\r\ncould not know that Mr. Jones was quick-minded enough to see already the\r\nend of his reign over his excellent secretary\'s thoughts and feelings;\r\nthe coming failure of Ricardo\'s fidelity. A woman had intervened!\r\nA woman, a girl, who apparently possessed the power to awaken\r\nmen\'s disgusting folly. Her power had been proved in two instances\r\nalready--the beastly innkeeper, and that man with moustaches, upon whom\r\nMr. Jones, his deadly right hand twitching in his pocket, glared more in\r\nrepulsion than in anger. The very object of the expedition was lost from\r\nview in his sudden and overwhelming sense of utter insecurity. And\r\nthis made Mr. Jones feel very savage; but not against the man with the\r\nmoustaches. Thus, while Heyst was really feeling that his life was\r\nnot worth two minutes, purchase, he heard himself addressed with\r\nno affectation of languid impertinence but with a burst of feverish\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n"Here! Let\'s call a truce!" said Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\nHeyst\'s heart was too sick to allow him to smile.\r\n\r\n"Have I been making war on you?" he asked wearily. "How do you expect\r\nme to attach any meaning to your words?" he went on. "You seem to be a\r\nmorbid, senseless sort of bandit. We don\'t speak the same language. If I\r\nwere to tell you why I am here, talking to you, you wouldn\'t believe\r\nme, because you would not understand me. It certainly isn\'t the love\r\nof life, from which I have divorced myself long ago--not sufficiently,\r\nperhaps; but if you are thinking of yours, then I repeat to you that it\r\nhas never been in danger from me. I am unarmed."\r\n\r\nMr Jones was biting his lower lip, in a deep meditation. It was only\r\ntowards the last that he looked at Heyst.\r\n\r\n"Unarmed, eh?" Then he burst out violently: "I tell you, a gentleman is\r\nno match for the common herd. And yet one must make use of the brutes.\r\nUnarmed, eh? And I suppose that creature is of the commonest sort. You\r\ncould hardly have got her out of a drawing-room. Though they\'re all\r\nalike, for that matter. Unarmed! It\'s a pity. I am in much greater\r\ndanger than you are or were--or I am much mistaken. But I am not--I know\r\nmy man!"\r\n\r\nHe lost his air of mental vacancy and broke out into shrill\r\nexclamations. To Heyst they seemed madder than anything that had gone\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"On the track! On the scent!" he cried, forgetting himself to the point\r\nof executing a dance of rage in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nHeyst looked on, fascinated by this skeleton in a gay dressing-gown,\r\njerkily agitated like a grotesque toy on the end of an invisible string.\r\nIt became quiet suddenly.\r\n\r\n"I might have smelt a rat! I always knew that this would be the danger."\r\nHe changed suddenly to a confidential tone, fixing his sepulchral stare\r\non Heyst. "And yet here I am, taken in by the fellow, like the veriest\r\nfool. I\'ve been always on the watch for some beastly influence, but here\r\nI am, fairly caught. He shaved himself right in front of me and I never\r\nguessed!"\r\n\r\nThe shrill laugh, following on the low tone of secrecy, sounded so\r\nconvincingly insane that Heyst got up as if moved by a spring. Mr. Jones\r\nstepped back two paces, but displayed no uneasiness.\r\n\r\n"It\'s as clear as daylight!" he uttered mournfully, and fell silent.\r\n\r\nBehind him the doorway flickered lividly, and the sound as of a naval\r\naction somewhere away on the horizon filled the breathless pause.\r\nMr. Jones inclined his head on his shoulder. His mood had completely\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n"What do you say, unarmed man? Shall we go and see what is detaining\r\nmy trusted Martin so long? He asked me to keep you engaged in friendly\r\nconversation till he made a further examination of that track. Ha, ha,\r\nha!"\r\n\r\n"He is no doubt ransacking my house," said Heyst.\r\n\r\nHe was bewildered. It seemed to him that all this was an\r\nincomprehensible dream, or perhaps an elaborate other-world joke,\r\ncontrived by that spectre in a gorgeous dressing gown.\r\n\r\nMr Jones looked at him with a horrible, cadaverous smile of inscrutable\r\nmockery, and pointed to the door. Heyst passed through it first. His\r\nfeelings had become so blunted that he did not care how soon he was shot\r\nin the back.\r\n\r\n"How oppressive the air is!" the voice of Mr. Jones said at his elbow.\r\n"This stupid storm gets on my nerves. I would welcome some rain, though\r\nit would be unpleasant to get wet. On the other hand, this exasperating\r\nthunder has the advantage of covering the sound of our approach. The\r\nlightning\'s not so convenient. Ah, your house is fully illuminated!\r\nMy clever Martin is punishing your stock of candles. He belongs to the\r\nunceremonious classes, which are also unlovely, untrustworthy, and so\r\non."\r\n\r\n"I left the candles burning," said Heyst, "to save him trouble."\r\n\r\n"You really believed he would go to your house?" asked Mr. Jones with\r\ngenuine interest.\r\n\r\n"I had that notion, strongly. I do believe he is there now."\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t mind?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t!" Mr. Jones stopped to wonder. "You are an extraordinary\r\nman," he said suspiciously, and moved on, touching elbows with Heyst.\r\n\r\nIn the latter\'s breast dwelt a deep silence, the complete silence of\r\nunused faculties. At this moment, by simply shouldering Mr. Jones, he\r\ncould have thrown him down and put himself, by a couple of leaps, beyond\r\nthe certain aim of the revolver; but he did not even think of that. His\r\nvery will seemed dead of weariness. He moved automatically, his head\r\nlow, like a prisoner captured by the evil power of a masquerading\r\nskeleton out of a grave. Mr. Jones took charge of the direction. They\r\nfetched a wide sweep. The echoes of distant thunder seemed to dog their\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\n"By the by," said Mr. Jones, as if unable to restrain his curiosity,\r\n"aren\'t you anxious about that--ouch!--that fascinating creature to whom\r\nyou owe whatever pleasure you can find in our visit?"\r\n\r\n"I have placed her in safety," said Heyst. "I--I took good care of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nMr Jones laid a hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n"You have? Look! is that what you mean?"\r\n\r\nHeyst raised his head. In the flicker of lightning the desolation of the\r\ncleared ground on his left leaped out and sank into the night, together\r\nwith the elusive forms of things distant, pale, unearthly. But in the\r\nbrilliant square of the door he saw the girl--the woman he had longed to\r\nsee once more as if enthroned, with her hands on the arms of the chair.\r\nShe was in black; her face was white, her head dreamily inclined on her\r\nbreast. He saw her only as low as her knees. He saw her--there, in the\r\nroom, alive with a sombre reality. It was no mocking vision. She was not\r\nin the forest--but there! She sat there in the chair, seemingly without\r\nstrength, yet without fear, tenderly stooping.\r\n\r\n"Can you understand their power?" whispered the hot breath of Mr. Jones\r\ninto his ear. "Can there be a more disgusting spectacle? It\'s enough to\r\nmake the earth detestable. She seems to have found her affinity. Move\r\non closer. If I have to shoot you in the end, then perhaps you will die\r\ncured."\r\n\r\nHeyst obeyed the pushing pressure of a revolver barrel between his\r\nshoulders. He felt it distinctly, but he did not feel the ground under\r\nhis feet. They found the steps, without his being aware that he was\r\nascending them--slowly, one by one. Doubt entered into him--a doubt of\r\na new kind, formless, hideous. It seemed to spread itself all over him,\r\nenter his limbs, and lodge in his entrails. He stopped suddenly, with\r\na thought that he who experienced such a feeling had no business to\r\nlive--or perhaps was no longer living.\r\n\r\nEverything--the bungalow, the forest, the open ground--trembled\r\nincessantly, the earth, the sky itself, shivered all the time, and the\r\nonly thing immovable in the shuddering universe was the interior of the\r\nlighted room and the woman in black sitting in the light of the eight\r\ncandle-flames. They flung around her an intolerable brilliance which\r\nhurt his eyes, seemed to sear his very brain with the radiation of\r\ninfernal heat. It was some time before his scorched eyes made out\r\nRicardo seated on the floor at some little distance, his back to the\r\ndoorway, but only partly so; one side of his upturned face showing the\r\nabsorbed, all forgetful rapture of his contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe grip of Mr. Jones\'s hard claw drew Heyst back a little. In the roll\r\nof thunder, swelling and subsiding, he whispered in his ear a sarcastic:\r\n"Of course!"\r\n\r\nA great shame descended upon Heyst--the shame of guilt, absurd and\r\nmaddening. Mr. Jones drew him still farther back into the darkness of\r\nthe veranda.\r\n\r\n"This is serious," he went on, distilling his ghostly venom into Heyst\'s\r\nvery ear. "I had to shut my eyes many times to his little flings; but\r\nthis is serious. He has found his soul-mate. Mud souls, obscene and\r\ncunning! Mud bodies, too--the mud of the gutter! I tell you, we are\r\nno match for the vile populace. I, even I, have been nearly caught. He\r\nasked me to detain you till he gave me the signal. It won\'t be you\r\nthat I\'ll have to shoot, but him. I wouldn\'t trust him near me for five\r\nminutes after this!"\r\n\r\nHe shook Heyst\'s arm a little.\r\n\r\n"If you had not happened to mention the creature, we should both have\r\nbeen dead before morning. He would have stabbed you as you came down\r\nthe steps after leaving me and then he would have walked up to me and\r\nplanted the same knife between my ribs. He has no prejudices. The viler\r\nthe origin, the greater the freedom of these simple souls!"\r\n\r\nHe drew a cautious, hissing breath and added in an agitated murmur: "I\r\ncan see right into his mind, I have been nearly caught napping by his\r\ncunning."\r\n\r\nHe stretched his neck to peer into the room from the side. Heyst, too,\r\nmade a step forward, under the slight impulse of that slender hand\r\nclasping his hand with a thin, bony grasp.\r\n\r\n"Behold!" the skeleton of the crazy bandit jabbered thinly into his ear\r\nin spectral fellowship. "Behold the simple, Acis kissing the sandals\r\nof the nymph, on the way to her lips, all forgetful, while the menacing\r\nfife of Polyphemus already sounds close at hand--if he could only hear\r\nit! Stoop a little."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\nOn returning to the Heyst bungalow, rapid as if on wings, Ricardo\r\nfound Lena waiting for him. She was dressed in black; and at once his\r\nuplifting exultation was replaced by an awed and quivering patience\r\nbefore her white face, before the immobility of her reposeful pose, the\r\nmore amazing to him who had encountered the strength of her limbs and\r\nthe indomitable spirit in her body. She had come out after Heyst\'s\r\ndeparture, and had sat down under the portrait to wait for the return of\r\nthe man of violence and death. While lifting the curtain, she felt the\r\nanguish of her disobedience to her lover, which was soothed by a feeling\r\nshe had known before--a gentle flood of penetrating sweetness. She\r\nwas not automatically obeying a momentary suggestion, she was under\r\ninfluences more deliberate, more vague, and of greater potency. She had\r\nbeen prompted, not by her will, but by a force that was outside of her\r\nand more worthy. She reckoned upon nothing definite; she had calculated\r\nnothing. She saw only her purpose of capturing death--savage, sudden,\r\nirresponsible death, prowling round the man who possessed her, death\r\nembodied in the knife ready to strike into his heart. No doubt it had\r\nbeen a sin to throw herself into his arms. With that inspiration\r\nthat descends at times from above for the good or evil of our common\r\nmediocrity, she had a sense of having been for him only a violent and\r\nsincere choice of curiosity and pity--a thing that passes. She did not\r\nknow him. If he were to go away from her and disappear, she would utter\r\nno reproach, she would not resent it; for she would hold in herself the\r\nimpress of something most rare and precious--his embraces made her own\r\nby her courage in saving his life.\r\n\r\nAll she thought of--the essence of her tremors, her flushes of heat, and\r\nher shudders of cold--was the question how to get hold of that knife,\r\nthe mark and sign of stalking death. A tremor of impatience to clutch\r\nthe frightful thing, glimpsed once and unforgettable, agitated her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe instinctive flinging forward of these hands stopped Ricardo dead\r\nshort between the door and her chair, with the ready obedience of a\r\nconquered man who can bide his time. Her success disconcerted her. She\r\nlistened to the man\'s impassioned transports of terrible eulogy and even\r\nmore awful declarations of love. She was even able to meet his eyes,\r\noblique, apt to glide away, throwing feral gleams of desire.\r\n\r\n"No!" he was saying, after a fiery outpouring of words in which the most\r\nferocious phrases of love were mingled with wooing accents of entreaty.\r\n"I will have no more of it! Don\'t you mistrust me. I am sober in my\r\ntalk. Feel how quietly my heart beats. Ten times today when you, you,\r\nyou, swam in my eye, I thought it would burst one of my ribs or leap\r\nout of my throat. It has knocked itself dead and tired, waiting for this\r\nevening, for this very minute. And now it can do no more. Feel how quiet\r\nit is!"\r\n\r\nHe made a step forward, but she raised her clear voice commandingly:\r\n\r\n"No nearer!"\r\n\r\nHe stopped with a smile of imbecile worship on his lips, and with the\r\ndelighted obedience of a man who could at any moment seize her in his\r\nhands and dash her to the ground.\r\n\r\n"Ah! If I had taken you by the throat this morning and had my way with\r\nyou, I should never have known what you are. And now I do. You are a\r\nwonder! And so am I, in my way. I have nerve, and I have brains, too.\r\nWe should have been lost many times but for me. I plan--I plot for my\r\ngentleman. Gentleman--pah! I am sick of him. And you are sick of yours,\r\neh? You, you!"\r\n\r\nHe shook all over; he cooed at her a string of endearing names, obscene\r\nand tender, and then asked abruptly:\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you speak to me?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s my part to listen," she said, giving him an inscrutable smile,\r\nwith a flush on her cheek and her lips cold as ice.\r\n\r\n"But you will answer me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, her eyes dilated as if with sudden interest.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s that plunder? Do you know?"\r\n\r\n"No! Not yet."\r\n\r\n"But there is plunder stowed somewhere that\'s worth having?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so. But who knows?" she added after a pause.\r\n\r\n"And who cares?" he retorted recklessly. "I\'ve had enough of this\r\ncrawling on my belly. It\'s you who are my treasure. It\'s I who found you\r\nout where a gentleman had buried you to rot for his accursed pleasure!"\r\n\r\nHe looked behind him and all around for a seat, then turned to her his\r\ntroubled eyes and dim smile.\r\n\r\n"I am dog-tired," he said, and sat down on the floor. "I went tired this\r\nmorning, since I came in here and started talking to you--as tired as if\r\nI had been pouring my life-blood here on these planks for you to dabble\r\nyour white feet in."\r\n\r\nUnmoved, she nodded at him thoughtfully. Woman-like, all her faculties\r\nremained concentrated on her heart\'s desire--on the knife--while the man\r\nwent on babbling insanely at her feet, ingratiating and savage, almost\r\ncrazy with elation. But he, too, was holding on to his purpose.\r\n\r\n"For you! For you I will throw away money, lives--all the lives but\r\nmine! What you want is a man, a master that will let you put the heel of\r\nyour shoe on his neck; not that skulker, who will get tired of you in a\r\nyear--and you of him. And then what? You are not the one to sit still;\r\nneither am I. I live for myself, and you shall live for yourself,\r\ntoo--not for a Swedish baron. They make a convenience of people like you\r\nand me. A gentleman is better than an employer, but an equal partnership\r\nagainst all the \'yporcrits is the thing for you and me. We\'ll go on\r\nwandering the world over, you and I both free and both true. You are no\r\ncage bird. We\'ll rove together, for we are of them that have no homes.\r\nWe are born rovers!"\r\n\r\nShe listened to him with the utmost attention, as if any unexpected\r\nword might give her some sort of opening to get that dagger, that awful\r\nknife--to disarm murder itself, pleading for her love at her feet. Again\r\nshe nodded at him thoughtfully, rousing a gleam in his yellow eyes,\r\nyearning devotedly upon her face. When he hitched himself a little\r\ncloser, her soul had no movement of recoil. This had to be. Anything\r\nhad to be which would bring the knife within her reach. He talked more\r\nconfidentially now.\r\n\r\n"We have met, and their time has come," he began, looking up into her\r\neyes. "The partnership between me and my gentleman has to be ripped up.\r\nThere\'s no room for him where we two are. Why, he would shoot me like a\r\ndog! Don\'t you worry. This will settle it not later than tonight!"\r\n\r\nHe tapped his folded leg below the knee, and was surprised, flattered,\r\nby the lighting up of her face, which stooped towards him eagerly and\r\nremained expectant, the lips girlishly parted, red in the pale face, and\r\nquivering in the quickened drawing of her breath.\r\n\r\n"You marvel, you miracle, you man\'s luck and joy--one in a million! No,\r\nthe only one. You have found your man in me," he whispered tremulously.\r\n"Listen! They are having their last talk together; for I\'ll do for your\r\ngentleman, too, by midnight."\r\n\r\nWithout the slightest tremor she murmured, as soon as the tightening of\r\nher breast had eased off and the words would come:\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be in too much of a hurry--with him."\r\n\r\nThe pause, the tone, had all the value of meditated advice.\r\n\r\n"Good, thrifty girl!" he laughed low, with a strange feline gaiety,\r\nexpressed by the undulating movement of his shoulders and the sparkling\r\nsnap of his oblique eyes. "You are still thinking about the chance of\r\nthat swag. You\'ll make a good partner, that you will! And, I say, what a\r\ndecoy you will make! Jee-miny!"\r\n\r\nHe was carried away for a moment, but his face darkened swiftly.\r\n\r\n"No! No reprieve. What do you think a fellow is--a scarecrow? All hat\r\nand clothes and no feeling, no inside, no brain to make fancies for\r\nhimself? No!" he went on violently. "Never in his life will he go again\r\ninto that room of yours--never any more!"\r\n\r\nA silence fell. He was gloomy with the torment of his jealousy, and did\r\nnot even look at her. She sat up and slowly, gradually, bent lower and\r\nlower over him, as if ready to fall into his arms. He looked up at last,\r\nand checked this droop unwittingly.\r\n\r\n"Say! You, who are up to fighting a man with your bare hands, could\r\nyou--eh?--could you manage to stick one with a thing like that knife of\r\nmine?"\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes very wide and gave him a wild smile.\r\n\r\n"How can I tell?" she whispered enchantingly. "Will you let me have a\r\nlook at it?"\r\n\r\nWithout taking his eyes from her face, he pulled the knife out of its\r\nsheath--a short, broad, cruel double-edged blade with a bone handle--and\r\nonly then looked down at it.\r\n\r\n"A good friend," he said simply. "Take it in your hand and feel the\r\nbalance," he suggested.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when she bent forward to receive it from him, there was\r\na flash of fire in her mysterious eyes--a red gleam in the white mist\r\nwhich wrapped the promptings and longings of her soul. She had done it!\r\nThe very sting of death was in her hands, the venom of the viper in her\r\nparadise, extracted, safe in her possession--and the viper\'s head all\r\nbut lying under her heel. Ricardo, stretched on the mats of the floor,\r\ncrept closer and closer to the chair in which she sat.\r\n\r\nAll her thoughts were busy planning how to keep possession of that\r\nweapon which had seemed to have drawn into itself every danger and\r\nmenace on the death-ridden earth. She said with a low laugh, the\r\nexultation in which he failed to recognize:\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think that you would ever trust me with that thing!"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"For fear I should suddenly strike you with it."\r\n\r\n"What for? For this morning\'s work? Oh, no! There\'s no spite in you for\r\nthat. You forgave me. You saved me. You got the better of me, too. And\r\nanyhow, what good would it be?"\r\n\r\n"No, no good," she admitted.\r\n\r\nIn her heart she felt that she would not know how to do it; that if it\r\ncame to a struggle, she would have to drop the dagger and fight with her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"Listen. When we are going about the world together, you shall always\r\ncall me husband. Do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said bracing herself for the contest, in whatever shape it\r\nwas coming.\r\n\r\nThe knife was lying in her lap. She let it slip into the fold of her\r\ndress, and laid her forearms with clasped fingers over her knees, which\r\nshe pressed desperately together. The dreaded thing was out of sight at\r\nlast. She felt a dampness break out all over her.\r\n\r\n"I am not going to hide you, like that good-for-nothing, finicky, sneery\r\ngentleman. You shall be my pride and my chum. Isn\'t that better than\r\nrotting on an island for the pleasure of a gentleman, till he gives you\r\nthe chuck?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be anything you like," she said.\r\n\r\nIn his intoxication he crept closer with every word she uttered, with\r\nevery movement she made.\r\n\r\n"Give your foot," he begged in a timid murmur, and in the full\r\nconsciousness of his power.\r\n\r\nAnything! Anything to keep murder quiet and disarmed till strength had\r\nreturned to her limbs and she could make up her mind what to do. Her\r\nfortitude had been shaken by the very facility of success that had come\r\nto her. She advanced her foot forward a little from under the hem of her\r\nskirt; and he threw himself on it greedily. She was not even aware of\r\nhim. She had thought of the forest, to which she had been told to run.\r\nYes, the forest--that was the place for her to carry off the terrible\r\nspoil, the sting of vanquished death. Ricardo, clasping her ankle,\r\npressed his lips time after time to the instep, muttering gasping words\r\nthat were like sobs, making little noises that resembled the sounds of\r\ngrief and distress. Unheard by them both, the thunder growled distantly\r\nwith angry modulations of it\'s tremendous voice, while the world outside\r\nshuddered incessantly around the dead stillness of the room where the\r\nframed profile of Heyst\'s father looked severely into space.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ricardo felt himself spurned by the foot he had been\r\ncherishing--spurned with a push of such violence into the very hollow of\r\nhis throat that it swung him back instantly into an upright position on\r\nhis knees. He read his danger in the stony eyes of the girl; and in\r\nthe very act of leaping to his feet he heard sharply, detached on the\r\ncomminatory voice of the storm the brief report of a shot which half\r\nstunned him, in the manner of a blow. He turned his burning head, and\r\nsaw Heyst towering in the doorway. The thought that the beggar had\r\nstarted to prance darted through his mind. For a fraction of a second\r\nhis distracted eyes sought for his weapon all over the floor. He\r\ncouldn\'t see it.\r\n\r\n"Stick him, you!" he called hoarsely to the girl, and dashed headlong\r\nfor the door of the compound.\r\n\r\nWhile he thus obeyed the instinct of self-preservation, his reason was\r\ntelling him that he could not possibly reach it alive. It flew open,\r\nhowever, with a crash, before his launched weight, and instantly he\r\nswung it to behind him. There, his shoulder leaning against it, his\r\nhands clinging to the handle, dazed and alone in the night full of\r\nshudders and muttered menaces, he tried to pull himself together. He\r\nasked himself if he had been shot at more than once. His shoulder was\r\nwet with the blood trickling from his head. Feeling above his ear, he\r\nascertained that it was only a graze, but the shock of the surprise had\r\nunmanned him for the moment.\r\n\r\nWhat the deuce was the governor about to let the beggar break loose like\r\nthis? Or--was the governor dead, perhaps?\r\n\r\nThe silence within the room awed him. Of going back there could be no\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"But she knows how to take care of her self," he muttered.\r\n\r\nShe had his knife. It was she now who was deadly, while he was disarmed,\r\nno good for the moment. He stole away from the door, staggering, the\r\nwarm trickle running down his neck, to find out what had become of the\r\ngovernor and to provide himself with a firearm from the armoury in the\r\ntrunks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\nMr Jones, after firing his shot over Heyst\'s shoulder, had thought it\r\nproper to dodge away. Like the spectre he was, he noiselessly vanished\r\nfrom the veranda. Heyst stumbled into the room and looked around. All\r\nthe objects in there--the books, portrait on the wall--seemed shadowy,\r\nunsubstantial, the dumb accomplices of an amazing dream-plot ending in\r\nan illusory effect of awakening and the impossibility of ever closing\r\nhis eyes again. With dread he forced himself to look at the girl. Still\r\nin the chair, she was leaning forward far over her knees, and had hidden\r\nher face in her hands. Heyst remembered Wang suddenly. How clear all\r\nthis was--and how extremely amusing! Very.\r\n\r\nShe sat up a little, then leaned back, and taking her hands from her\r\nface, pressed both of them to her breast as if moved to the heart by\r\nseeing him there looking at her with a black, horror-struck curiosity.\r\nHe would have pitied her, if the triumphant expression of her face had\r\nnot given him a shock which destroyed the balance of his feelings. She\r\nspoke with an accent of wild joy:\r\n\r\n"I knew you would come back in time! You are safe now. I have done it!\r\nI would never, never have let him--" Her voice died out, while her eyes\r\nshone at him as when the sun breaks through a mist. "Never get it back.\r\nOh, my beloved!"\r\n\r\nHe bowed his head gravely, and said in his polite. Heystian tone:\r\n\r\n"No doubt you acted from instinct. Women have been provided with their\r\nown weapon. I was a disarmed man, I have been a disarmed man all my life\r\nas I see it now. You may glory in your resourcefulness and your profound\r\nknowledge of yourself; but I may say that the other attitude, suggestive\r\nof shame, had its charm. For you are full of charm!"\r\n\r\nThe exultation vanished from her face.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t make fun of me now. I know no shame. I was thanking God\r\nwith all my sinful heart for having been able to do it--for giving you\r\nto me in that way--oh, my beloved--all my own at last!"\r\n\r\nHe stared as if mad. Timidly she tried to excuse herself for disobeying\r\nhis directions for her safety. Every modulation of her enchanting voice\r\ncut deep into his very breast, so that he could hardly understand the\r\nwords for the sheer pain of it. He turned his back on her; but a sudden\r\ndrop, an extraordinary faltering of her tone, made him spin round. On\r\nher white neck her pale head dropped as in a cruel drought a withered\r\nflower droops on its stalk. He caught his breath, looked at her closely,\r\nand seemed to read some awful intelligence in her eyes. At the moment\r\nwhen her eyelids fell as if smitten from above by an the gleam of\r\nold silver familiar to him from boyhood, the very invisible power, he\r\nsnatched her up bodily out of the chair, and disregarding an unexpected\r\nmetallic clatter on the floor, carried her off into the other room. The\r\nlimpness of her body frightened him. Laying her down on the bed, he\r\nran out again, seized a four-branched candlestick on the table, and ran\r\nback, tearing down with a furious jerk the curtain that swung stupidly\r\nin his way, but after putting the candlestick on the table by the bed,\r\nhe remained absolutely idle. There did not seem anything more for him\r\nto do. Holding his chin in his hand he looked down intently at her still\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Has she been stabbed with this thing?" asked Davidson, whom suddenly he\r\nsaw standing by his side and holding up Ricardo\'s dagger to his sight.\r\nHeyst uttered no word of recognition or surprise. He gave Davidson only\r\na dumb look of unutterable awe, then, as if possessed with a sudden\r\nfury, started tearing open the front of the girls dress. She remained\r\ninsensible under his hands, and Heyst let out a groan which made\r\nDavidson shudder inwardly the heavy plaint of a man who falls clubbed in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nThey stood side by side, looking mournfully at the little black hole\r\nmade by Mr. Jones\'s bullet under the swelling breast of a dazzling and\r\nas it were sacred whiteness. It rose and fell slightly--so slightly that\r\nonly the eyes of the lover could detect the faint stir of life. Heyst,\r\ncalm and utterly unlike himself in the face, moving about noiselessly,\r\nprepared a wet cloth, and laid it on the insignificant wound,\r\nround which there was hardly a trace of blood to mar the charm, the\r\nfascination, of that mortal flesh.\r\n\r\nHer eyelids fluttered. She looked drowsily about, serene, as if fatigued\r\nonly by the exertions of her tremendous victory, capturing the very\r\nsting of death in the service of love. But her eyes became very\r\nwide awake when they caught sight of Ricardo\'s dagger, the spoil of\r\nvanquished death, which Davidson was still holding, unconsciously.\r\n\r\n"Give it to me," she said. "It\'s mine."\r\n\r\nDavidson put the symbol of her victory into her feeble hands extended to\r\nhim with the innocent gesture of a child reaching eagerly for a toy.\r\n\r\n"For you," she gasped, turning her eyes to Heyst. "Kill nobody."\r\n\r\n"No," said Heyst, taking the dagger and laying it gently on her breast,\r\nwhile her hands fell powerless by her side.\r\n\r\nThe faint smile on her deep-cut lips waned, and her head sank deep into\r\nthe pillow, taking on the majestic pallor and immobility of marble.\r\nBut over the muscles, which seemed set in their transfigured beauty for\r\never, passed a slight and awful tremor. With an amazing strength she\r\nasked loudly:\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with me?"\r\n\r\n"You have been shot, dear Lena," Heyst said in a steady voice, while\r\nDavidson, at the question, turned away and leaned his forehead against\r\nthe post of the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Shot? I did think, too, that something had struck me."\r\n\r\nOver Samburan the thunder had ceased to growl at last, and the world of\r\nmaterial forms shuddered no more under the emerging stars. The spirit\r\nof the girl which was passing away from under them clung to her triumph\r\nconvinced of the reality of her victory over death.\r\n\r\n"No more," she muttered. "There will be no more! Oh, my beloved," she\r\ncried weakly, "I\'ve saved you! Why don\'t you take me into your arms and\r\ncarry me out of this lonely place?"\r\n\r\nHeyst bent low over her, cursing his fastidious soul, which even at that\r\nmoment kept the true cry of love from his lips in its infernal mistrust\r\nof all life. He dared not touch her and she had no longer the strength\r\nto throw her arms about his neck.\r\n\r\n"Who else could have done this for you?" she whispered gloriously.\r\n\r\n"No one in the world," he answered her in a murmur of unconcealed\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nShe tried to raise herself, but all she could do was to lift her head\r\na little from the pillow. With a terrible and gentle movement, Heyst\r\nhastened to slip his arm under her neck. She felt relieved at once of\r\nan intolerable weight, and was content to surrender to him the infinite\r\nweariness of her tremendous achievement. Exulting, she saw herself\r\nextended on the bed, in a black dress, and profoundly at peace, while,\r\nstooping over her with a kindly, playful smile, he was ready to lift\r\nher up in his firm arms and take her into the sanctuary of his innermost\r\nheart--for ever! The flush of rapture flooding her whole being broke out\r\nin a smile of innocent, girlish happiness; and with that divine radiance\r\non her lips she breathed her last--triumphant, seeking for his glance in\r\nthe shades of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n "Yes, Excellency," said Davidson in his placid voice; "there are more dead in this affair--more white people, I mean--than have been killed in many of the battles in the last Achin war."\r\n\r\nDavidson was talking with an Excellency, because what was alluded to in\r\nconversation as "the mystery of Samburan" had caused such a sensation in\r\nthe Archipelago that even those in the highest spheres were anxious to\r\nhear something at first hand. Davidson had been summoned to an audience.\r\nIt was a high official on his tour.\r\n\r\n"You knew the late Baron Heyst well?"\r\n\r\n"The truth is that nobody out here can boast of having known him well,"\r\nsaid Davidson. "He was a queer chap. I doubt if he himself knew how\r\nqueer he was. But everybody was aware that I was keeping my eye on him\r\nin a friendly way. And that\'s how I got the warning which made me turn\r\nround in my tracks. In the middle of my trip and steam back to Samburan,\r\nwhere, I am grieved to say, I arrived too late."\r\n\r\nWithout enlarging very much, Davidson explained to the attentive\r\nExcellency how a woman, the wife of a certain hotel-keeper named\r\nSchomberg, had overheard two card-sharping rascals making inquiries from\r\nher husband as to the exact position of the island. She caught only a\r\nfew words referring to the neighbouring volcano, but there were enough\r\nto arouse her suspicions--"which," went on Davidson, "she imparted to\r\nme, your Excellency. They were only too well founded!"\r\n\r\n"That was very clever of her," remarked the great man.\r\n\r\n"She\'s much cleverer than people have any conception of," said Davidson.\r\n\r\nBut he refrained from disclosing to the Excellency the real cause which\r\nhad sharpened Mrs. Schomberg\'s wits. The poor woman was in mortal terror\r\nof the girl being brought back within reach of her infatuated Wilhelm.\r\nDavidson only said that her agitation had impressed him; but he\r\nconfessed that while going back, he began to have his doubts as to there\r\nbeing anything in it.\r\n\r\n"I steamed into one of those silly thunderstorms that hang about the\r\nvolcano, and had some trouble in making the island," narrated Davidson.\r\n"I had to grope my way dead slow into Diamond Bay. I don\'t suppose that\r\nanybody, even if looking out for me, could have heard me let go the\r\nanchor."\r\n\r\nHe admitted that he ought to have gone ashore at once; but everything\r\nwas perfectly dark and absolutely quiet. He felt ashamed of his\r\nimpulsiveness. What a fool he would have looked, waking up a man in the\r\nmiddle of the night just to ask him if he was all right! And then the\r\ngirl being there, he feared that Heyst would look upon his visit as an\r\nunwarrantable intrusion.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation he had of there being anything wrong was a big\r\nwhite boat, adrift, with the dead body of a very hairy man inside,\r\nbumping against the bows of his steamer. Then indeed he lost no time in\r\ngoing ashore--alone, of course, from motives of delicacy.\r\n\r\n"I arrived in time to see that poor girl die, as I have told your\r\nExcellency," pursued Davidson. "I won\'t tell you what a time I had with\r\nhim afterwards. He talked to me. His father seems to have been a crank,\r\nand to have upset his head when he was young. He was a queer chap.\r\nPractically the last words he said to me, as we came out on the veranda,\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n"\'Ah, Davidson, woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young\r\nto hope, to love--and to put its trust in life!\'\r\n\r\n"As we stood there, just before I left him, for he said he wanted to be\r\nalone with his dead for a time, we heard a snarly sort of voice near the\r\nbushes by the shore calling out:\r\n\r\n"\'Is that you, governor?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, it\'s me.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Jeeminy! I thought the beggar had done for you. He has started\r\nprancing and nearly had me. I have been dodging around, looking for you\r\never since.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well, here I am,\' suddenly screamed the other voice, and then a shot\r\nrang out.\r\n\r\n"\'This time he has not missed him,\' Heyst said to me bitterly, and went\r\nback into the house.\r\n\r\n"I returned on board as he had insisted I should do. I didn\'t want\r\nto intrude on his grief. Later, about five in the morning, some of my\r\ncalashes came running to me, yelling that there was a fire ashore. I\r\nlanded at once, of course. The principal bungalow was blazing. The\r\nheat drove us back. The other two houses caught one after another like\r\nkindling-wood. There was no going beyond the shore end of the jetty till\r\nthe afternoon."\r\n\r\nDavidson sighed placidly.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are certain that Baron Heyst is dead?"\r\n\r\n"He is--ashes, your Excellency," said Davidson, wheezing a little; "he\r\nand the girl together. I suppose he couldn\'t stand his thoughts before\r\nher dead body--and fire purifies everything. That Chinaman of whom I\r\ntold your Excellency helped me to investigate next day, when the\r\nembers got cooled a little. We found enough to be sure. He\'s not a bad\r\nChinaman. He told me that he had followed Heyst and the girl through the\r\nforest from pity, and partly out of curiosity. He watched the house till\r\nhe saw Heyst go out, after dinner, and Ricardo come back alone. While he\r\nwas dodging there, it occurred to him that he had better cast the boat\r\nadrift, for fear those scoundrels should come round by water and bombard\r\nthe village from the sea with their revolvers and Winchesters. He judged\r\nthat they were devils enough for anything. So he walked down the wharf\r\nquietly; and as he got into the boat, to cast her off, that hairy man\r\nwho, it seems, was dozing in her, jumped up growling, and Wang shot him\r\ndead. Then he shoved the boat off as far as he could and went away."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Presently Davidson went on, in his tranquil manner:\r\n\r\n"Let Heaven look after what has been purified. The wind and rain will\r\ntake care of the ashes. The carcass of that follower, secretary, or\r\nwhatever the unclean ruffian called himself, I left where it lay, to\r\nswell and rot in the sun. His principal had shot him neatly through the\r\nhead. Then, apparently, this Jones went down to the wharf to look for\r\nthe boat and for the hairy man. I suppose he tumbled into the water by\r\naccident--or perhaps not by accident. The boat and the man were gone,\r\nand the scoundrel saw himself alone, his game clearly up, and fairly\r\ntrapped. Who knows? The water\'s very clear there, and I could see him\r\nhuddled up on the bottom, between two piles, like a heap of bones in a\r\nblue silk bag, with only the head and the feet sticking out. Wang was\r\nvery pleased when he discovered him. That made everything safe, he said,\r\nand he went at once over the hill to fetch his Alfuro woman back to the\r\nhut."\r\n\r\nDavidson took out his handkerchief to wipe the perspiration off his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n"And then, your Excellency, I went away. There was nothing to be done\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Clearly!" assented the Excellency.\r\n\r\nDavidson, thoughtful, seemed to weigh the matter in his mind, and then\r\nmurmured with placid sadness:\r\n\r\n"Nothing!"\r\n\r\nOctober 1912--May 1914\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Victory, by Joseph Conrad\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VICTORY ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 6378-h.htm or 6378-h.zip ***** This and\r\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/3/7/6378/\r\n\r\nProduced by Tracy Camp and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\r\nrenamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\r\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\r\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\r\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\r\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\r\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\r\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\r\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\r\nFoundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\r\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\r\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\r\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\r\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\r\nthe IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\r\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\r\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\r\nplease visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\r\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\r\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\r\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\r\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
