Here is\r\none more book that depicts the struggle of a human creature, under\r\nthose opposing influences of Good and Evil, which we have all felt,\r\nwhich we have all known. It has been my aim to make the character of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen,\xe2\x80\x9d which personifies this struggle, a pathetic character even\r\nin its perversity and its error; and I have tried hard to attain this\r\nresult by the least obtrusive and the least artificial of all means\xe2\x80\x94by\r\na resolute adherence throughout to the truth as it is in Nature. This\r\ndesign was no easy one to accomplish; and it has been a great\r\nencouragement to me (during the publication of my story in its\r\nperiodical form) to know, on the authority of many readers, that the\r\nobject which I had proposed to myself, I might, in some degree,\r\nconsider as an object achieved.\r\n\r\nRound the central figure in the narrative other characters will be\r\nfound grouped, in sharp contrast\xe2\x80\x94contrast, for the most part, in which\r\nI have endeavored to make the element of humor mainly predominant. I\r\nhave sought to impart this relief to the more serious passages in the\r\nbook, not only because I believe myself to be justified in doing so by\r\nthe laws of Art\xe2\x80\x94but because experience has taught me (what the\r\nexperience of my readers will doubtless confirm) that there is no such\r\nmoral phenomenon as unmixed tragedy to be found in the world around us.\r\nLook where we may, the dark threads and the light cross each other\r\nperpetually in the texture of human life.\r\n\r\nTo pass from the Characters to the Story, it will be seen that the\r\nnarrative related in these pages has been constructed on a plan which\r\ndiffers from the plan followed in my last novel, and in some other of\r\nmy works published at an earlier date. The only Secret contained in\r\nthis book is revealed midway in the first volume. From that point, all\r\nthe main events of the story are purposely foreshadowed before they\r\ntake place\xe2\x80\x94my present design being to rouse the reader\xe2\x80\x99s interest in\r\nfollowing the train of circumstances by which these foreseen events are\r\nbrought about. In trying this new ground, I am not turning my back in\r\ndoubt on the ground which I have passed over already. My one object in\r\nfollowing a new course is to enlarge the range of my studies in the art\r\nof writing fiction, and to vary the form in which I make my appeal to\r\nthe reader, as attractively as I can.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for me to add more to these few prefatory words than\r\nis here written. What I might otherwise have wished to say in this\r\nplace, I have endeavored to make the book itself say for me.\r\n\r\n_Harley Street,\r\n    November_, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO NAME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SCENE.\r\nCOMBE-RAVEN, SOMERSETSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe hands on the hall-clock pointed to half-past six in the morning.\r\nThe house was a country residence in West Somersetshire, called\r\nCombe-Raven. The day was the fourth of March, and the year was eighteen\r\nhundred and forty-six.\r\n\r\nNo sounds but the steady ticking of the clock, and the lumpish snoring\r\nof a large dog stretched on a mat outside the dining-room door,\r\ndisturbed the mysterious morning stillness of hall and staircase. Who\r\nwere the sleepers hidden in the upper regions? Let the house reveal its\r\nown secrets; and, one by one, as they descend the stairs from their\r\nbeds, let the sleepers disclose themselves.\r\n\r\nAs the clock pointed to a quarter to seven, the dog woke and shook\r\nhimself. After waiting in vain for the footman, who was accustomed to\r\nlet him out, the animal wandered restlessly from one closed door to\r\nanother on the ground-floor; and, returning to his mat in great\r\nperplexity, appealed to the sleeping family with a long and melancholy\r\nhowl.\r\n\r\nBefore the last notes of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrance had died away, the\r\noaken stairs in the higher regions of the house creaked under\r\nslowly-descending footsteps. In a minute more the first of the female\r\nservants made her appearance, with a dingy woolen shawl over her\r\nshoulders\xe2\x80\x94for the March morning was bleak; and rheumatism and the cook\r\nwere old acquaintances.\r\n\r\nReceiving the dog\xe2\x80\x99s first cordial advances with the worst possible\r\ngrace, the cook slowly opened the hall door and let the animal out. It\r\nwas a wild morning. Over a spacious lawn, and behind a black plantation\r\nof firs, the rising sun rent its way upward through piles of ragged\r\ngray cloud; heavy drops of rain fell few and far between; the March\r\nwind shuddered round the corners of the house, and the wet trees swayed\r\nwearily.\r\n\r\nSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck; and the signs of domestic life began to show\r\nthemselves in more rapid succession.\r\n\r\nThe housemaid came down\xe2\x80\x94tall and slim, with the state of the spring\r\ntemperature written redly on her nose. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid followed\xe2\x80\x94young,\r\nsmart, plump, and sleepy. The kitchen-maid came next\xe2\x80\x94afflicted with the\r\nface-ache, and making no secret of her sufferings. Last of all, the\r\nfootman appeared, yawning disconsolately; the living picture of a man\r\nwho felt that he had been defrauded of his fair night\xe2\x80\x99s rest.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the servants, when they assembled before the slowly\r\nlighting kitchen fire, referred to a recent family event, and turned at\r\nstarting on this question: Had Thomas, the footman, seen anything of\r\nthe concert at Clifton, at which his master and the two young ladies\r\nhad been present on the previous night? Yes; Thomas had heard the\r\nconcert; he had been paid for to go in at the back; it was a loud\r\nconcert; it was a hot concert; it was described at the top of the bills\r\nas Grand; whether it was worth traveling sixteen miles to hear by\r\nrailway, with the additional hardship of going back nineteen miles by\r\nroad, at half-past one in the morning\xe2\x80\x94was a question which he would\r\nleave his master and the young ladies to decide; his own opinion, in\r\nthe meantime, being unhesitatingly, No. Further inquiries, on the part\r\nof all the female servants in succession, elicited no additional\r\ninformation of any sort. Thomas could hum none of the songs, and could\r\ndescribe none of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 dresses. His audience, accordingly, gave\r\nhim up in despair; and the kitchen small-talk flowed back into its\r\nordinary channels, until the clock struck eight and startled the\r\nassembled servants into separating for their morning\xe2\x80\x99s work.\r\n\r\nA quarter past eight, and nothing happened. Half-past\xe2\x80\x94and more signs of\r\nlife appeared from the bedroom regions. The next member of the family\r\nwho came downstairs was Mr. Andrew Vanstone, the master of the house.\r\n\r\nTall, stout, and upright\xe2\x80\x94with bright blue eyes, and healthy, florid\r\ncomplexion\xe2\x80\x94his brown plush shooting-jacket carelessly buttoned awry;\r\nhis vixenish little Scotch terrier barking unrebuked at his heels; one\r\nhand thrust into his waistcoat pocket, and the other smacking the\r\nbanisters cheerfully as he came downstairs humming a tune\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Vanstone\r\nshowed his character on the surface of him freely to all men. An easy,\r\nhearty, handsome, good-humored gentleman, who walked on the sunny side\r\nof the way of life, and who asked nothing better than to meet all his\r\nfellow-passengers in this world on the sunny side, too. Estimating him\r\nby years, he had turned fifty. Judging him by lightness of heart,\r\nstrength of constitution, and capacity for enjoyment, he was no older\r\nthan most men who have only turned thirty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomas!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Vanstone, taking up his old felt hat and his thick\r\nwalking stick from the hall table. \xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast, this morning, at ten.\r\nThe young ladies are not likely to be down earlier after the concert\r\nlast night.\xe2\x80\x94By-the-by, how did you like the concert yourself, eh? You\r\nthought it was grand? Quite right; so it was. Nothing but crash-bang,\r\nvaried now and then by bang-crash; all the women dressed within an inch\r\nof their lives; smothering heat, blazing gas, and no room for\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x94yes, yes, Thomas; grand\xe2\x80\x99s the word for it, and comfortable\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d With that expression of opinion, Mr. Vanstone whistled to his\r\nvixenish terrier; flourished his stick at the hall door in cheerful\r\ndefiance of the rain; and set off through wind and weather for his\r\nmorning walk.\r\n\r\nThe hands, stealing their steady way round the dial of the clock,\r\npointed to ten minutes to nine. Another member of the family appeared\r\non the stairs\xe2\x80\x94Miss Garth, the governess.\r\n\r\nNo observant eyes could have surveyed Miss Garth without seeing at once\r\nthat she was a north-countrywoman. Her hard featured face; her\r\nmasculine readiness and decision of movement; her obstinate honesty of\r\nlook and manner, all proclaimed her border birth and border training.\r\nThough little more than forty years of age, her hair was quite gray;\r\nand she wore over it the plain cap of an old woman. Neither hair nor\r\nhead-dress was out of harmony with her face\xe2\x80\x94it looked older than her\r\nyears: the hard handwriting of trouble had scored it heavily at some\r\npast time. The self-possession of her progress downstairs, and the air\r\nof habitual authority with which she looked about her, spoke well for\r\nher position in Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s family. This was evidently not one of\r\nthe forlorn, persecuted, pitiably dependent order of governesses. Here\r\nwas a woman who lived on ascertained and honorable terms with her\r\nemployers\xe2\x80\x94a woman who looked capable of sending any parents in England\r\nto the right-about, if they failed to rate her at her proper value.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast at ten?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Miss Garth, when the footman had answered\r\nthe bell, and had mentioned his master\xe2\x80\x99s orders. \xe2\x80\x9cHa! I thought what\r\nwould come of that concert last night. When people who live in the\r\ncountry patronize public amusements, public amusements return the\r\ncompliment by upsetting the family afterward for days together.\r\n_You\xe2\x80\x99re_ upset, Thomas, I can see your eyes are as red as a ferret\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand your cravat looks as if you had slept in it. Bring the kettle at a\r\nquarter to ten\xe2\x80\x94and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get better in the course of the day,\r\ncome to me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a dose of physic. That\xe2\x80\x99s a well-meaning\r\nlad, if you only let him alone,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miss Garth, in soliloquy,\r\nwhen Thomas had retired; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s not strong enough for concerts\r\ntwenty miles off. They wanted _me_ to go with them last night. Yes:\r\ncatch me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNine o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck; and the minute-hand stole on to twenty minutes\r\npast the hour, before any more footsteps were heard on the stairs. At\r\nthe end of that time, two ladies appeared, descending to the\r\nbreakfast-room together\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Vanstone and her eldest daughter.\r\n\r\nIf the personal attractions of Mrs. Vanstone, at an earlier period of\r\nlife, had depended solely on her native English charms of complexion\r\nand freshness, she must have long since lost the last relics of her\r\nfairer self. But her beauty as a young woman had passed beyond the\r\naverage national limits; and she still preserved the advantage of her\r\nmore exceptional personal gifts. Although she was now in her\r\nforty-fourth year; although she had been tried, in bygone times, by the\r\npremature loss of more than one of her children, and by long attacks of\r\nillness which had followed those bereavements of former years\xe2\x80\x94she still\r\npreserved the fair proportion and subtle delicacy of feature, once\r\nassociated with the all-adorning brightness and freshness of beauty,\r\nwhich had left her never to return. Her eldest child, now descending\r\nthe stairs by her side, was the mirror in which she could look back and\r\nsee again the reflection of her own youth. There, folded thick on the\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s head, lay the massive dark hair, which, on the mother\xe2\x80\x99s, was\r\nfast turning gray. There, in the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, glowed the lovely\r\ndusky red which had faded from the mother\xe2\x80\x99s to bloom again no more.\r\nMiss Vanstone had already reached the first maturity of womanhood; she\r\nhad completed her six-and-twentieth year. Inheriting the dark majestic\r\ncharacter of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, she had yet hardly inherited all its\r\ncharms. Though the shape of her face was the same, the features were\r\nscarcely so delicate, their proportion was scarcely so true. She was\r\nnot so tall. She had the dark-brown eyes of her mother\xe2\x80\x94full and soft,\r\nwith the steady luster in them which Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had lost\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyet there was less interest, less refinement and depth of feeling in\r\nher expression: it was gentle and feminine, but clouded by a certain\r\nquiet reserve, from which her mother\xe2\x80\x99s face was free. If we dare to\r\nlook closely enough, may we not observe that the moral force of\r\ncharacter and the higher intellectual capacities in parents seem often\r\nto wear out mysteriously in the course of transmission to children? In\r\nthese days of insidious nervous exhaustion and subtly-spreading nervous\r\nmalady, is it not possible that the same rule may apply, less rarely\r\nthan we are willing to admit, to the bodily gifts as well?\r\n\r\nThe mother and daughter slowly descended the stairs together\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\ndressed in dark brown, with an Indian shawl thrown over her shoulders;\r\nthe second more simply attired in black, with a plain collar and cuffs,\r\nand a dark orange-colored ribbon over the bosom of her dress. As they\r\ncrossed the hall and entered the breakfast-room, Miss Vanstone was full\r\nof the all-absorbing subject of the last night\xe2\x80\x99s concert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so sorry, mamma, you were not with us,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been\r\nso strong and so well ever since last summer\xe2\x80\x94you have felt so many\r\nyears younger, as you said yourself\xe2\x80\x94that I am sure the exertion would\r\nnot have been too much for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not, my love\xe2\x80\x94but it was as well to keep on the safe side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite as well,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Garth, appearing at the breakfast-room\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at Norah (good-morning, my dear)\xe2\x80\x94look, I say, at Norah. A\r\nperfect wreck; a living proof of your wisdom and mine in staying at\r\nhome. The vile gas, the foul air, the late hours\xe2\x80\x94what can you expect?\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s not made of iron, and she suffers accordingly. No, my dear, you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. I see you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a headache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s dark, handsome face brightened into a smile\xe2\x80\x94then lightly\r\nclouded again with its accustomed quiet reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very little headache; not half enough to make me regret the\r\nconcert,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and walked away by herself to the window.\r\n\r\nOn the far side of a garden and paddock the view overlooked a stream,\r\nsome farm buildings which lay beyond, and the opening of a wooded,\r\nrocky pass (called, in Somersetshire, a Combe), which here cleft its\r\nway through the hills that closed the prospect. A winding strip of road\r\nwas visible, at no great distance, amid the undulations of the open\r\nground; and along this strip the stalwart figure of Mr. Vanstone was\r\nnow easily recognizable, returning to the house from his morning walk.\r\nHe flourished his stick gayly, as he observed his eldest daughter at\r\nthe window. She nodded and waved her hand in return, very gracefully\r\nand prettily\xe2\x80\x94but with something of old-fashioned formality in her\r\nmanner, which looked strangely in so young a woman, and which seemed\r\nout of harmony with a salutation addressed to her father.\r\n\r\nThe hall-clock struck the adjourned breakfast-hour. When the minute\r\nhand had recorded the lapse of five minutes more a door banged in the\r\nbedroom regions\xe2\x80\x94a clear young voice was heard singing blithely\xe2\x80\x94light,\r\nrapid footsteps pattered on the upper stairs, descended with a jump to\r\nthe landing, and pattered again, faster than ever, down the lower\r\nflight. In another moment the youngest of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s two daughters\r\n(and two only surviving children) dashed into view on the dingy old\r\noaken stairs, with the suddenness of a flash of light; and clearing the\r\nlast three steps into the hall at a jump, presented herself breathless\r\nin the breakfast-room to make the family circle complete.\r\n\r\nBy one of those strange caprices of Nature, which science leaves still\r\nunexplained, the youngest of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s children presented no\r\nrecognizable resemblance to either of her parents. How had she come by\r\nher hair? how had she come by her eyes? Even her father and mother had\r\nasked themselves those questions, as she grew up to girlhood, and had\r\nbeen sorely perplexed to answer them. Her hair was of that purely\r\nlight-brown hue, unmixed with flaxen, or yellow, or red\xe2\x80\x94which is\r\noftener seen on the plumage of a bird than on the head of a human\r\nbeing. It was soft and plentiful, and waved downward from her low\r\nforehead in regular folds\xe2\x80\x94but, to some tastes, it was dull and dead, in\r\nits absolute want of glossiness, in its monotonous purity of plain\r\nlight color. Her eyebrows and eyelashes were just a shade darker than\r\nher hair, and seemed made expressly for those violet-blue eyes, which\r\nassert their most irresistible charm when associated with a fair\r\ncomplexion. But it was here exactly that the promise of her face failed\r\nof performance in the most startling manner. The eyes, which should\r\nhave been dark, were incomprehensibly and discordantly light; they were\r\nof that nearly colorless gray which, though little attractive in\r\nitself, possesses the rare compensating merit of interpreting the\r\nfinest gradations of thought, the gentlest changes of feeling, the\r\ndeepest trouble of passion, with a subtle transparency of expression\r\nwhich no darker eyes can rival. Thus quaintly self-contradictory in the\r\nupper part of her face, she was hardly less at variance with\r\nestablished ideas of harmony in the lower. Her lips had the true\r\nfeminine delicacy of form, her cheeks the lovely roundness and\r\nsmoothness of youth\xe2\x80\x94but the mouth was too large and firm, the chin too\r\nsquare and massive for her sex and age. Her complexion partook of the\r\npure monotony of tint which characterized her hair\xe2\x80\x94it was of the same\r\nsoft, warm, creamy fairness all over, without a tinge of color in the\r\ncheeks, except on occasions of unusual bodily exertion or sudden mental\r\ndisturbance. The whole countenance\xe2\x80\x94so remarkable in its strongly\r\nopposed characteristics\xe2\x80\x94was rendered additionally striking by its\r\nextraordinary mobility. The large, electric, light-gray eyes were\r\nhardly ever in repose; all varieties of expression followed each other\r\nover the plastic, ever-changing face, with a giddy rapidity which left\r\nsober analysis far behind in the race. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s exuberant vitality\r\nasserted itself all over her, from head to foot. Her figure\xe2\x80\x94taller than\r\nher sister\xe2\x80\x99s, taller than the average of woman\xe2\x80\x99s height; instinct with\r\nsuch a seductive, serpentine suppleness, so lightly and playfully\r\ngraceful, that its movements suggested, not unnaturally, the movements\r\nof a young cat\xe2\x80\x94her figure was so perfectly developed already that no\r\none who saw her could have supposed that she was only eighteen. She\r\nbloomed in the full physical maturity of twenty years or more\xe2\x80\x94bloomed\r\nnaturally and irresistibly, in right of her matchless health and\r\nstrength. Here, in truth, lay the mainspring of this\r\nstrangely-constituted organization. Her headlong course down the house\r\nstairs; the brisk activity of all her movements; the incessant sparkle\r\nof expression in her face; the enticing gayety which took the hearts of\r\nthe quietest people by storm\xe2\x80\x94even the reckless delight in bright colors\r\nwhich showed itself in her brilliantly-striped morning dress, in her\r\nfluttering ribbons, in the large scarlet rosettes on her smart little\r\nshoes\xe2\x80\x94all sprang alike from the same source; from the overflowing\r\nphysical health which strengthened every muscle, braced every nerve,\r\nand set the warm young blood tingling through her veins, like the blood\r\nof a growing child.\r\n\r\nOn her entry into the breakfast-room, she was saluted with the\r\ncustomary remonstrance which her flighty disregard of all punctuality\r\nhabitually provoked from the long-suffering household authorities. In\r\nMiss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s favorite phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen was born with all the\r\nsenses\xe2\x80\x94except a sense of order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen! It was a strange name to have given her? Strange, indeed; and\r\nyet, chosen under no extraordinary circumstances. The name had been\r\nborne by one of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s sisters, who had died in early youth;\r\nand, in affectionate remembrance of her, he had called his second\r\ndaughter by it\xe2\x80\x94just as he had called his eldest daughter Norah, for his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Magdalen! Surely, the grand old Bible name\xe2\x80\x94suggestive of a\r\nsad and somber dignity; recalling, in its first association, mournful\r\nideas of penitence and seclusion\xe2\x80\x94had been here, as events had turned\r\nout, inappropriately bestowed? Surely, this self-contradictory girl had\r\nperversely accomplished one contradiction more, by developing into a\r\ncharacter which was out of all harmony with her own Christian name!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLate again!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanstone, as Magdalen breathlessly kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLate again!\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in Miss Garth, when Magdalen came her way next.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, taking the girl\xe2\x80\x99s chin familiarly in her hand,\r\nwith a half-satirical, half-fond attention which betrayed that the\r\nyoungest daughter, with all her faults, was the governess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavorite\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell? and what has the concert done for _you?_ What form of\r\nsuffering has dissipation inflicted on _your_ system this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuffering!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Magdalen, recovering her breath, and the use of\r\nher tongue with it. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the meaning of the word: if there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanything the matter with me, I\xe2\x80\x99m too well. Suffering! I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for\r\nanother concert to-night, and a ball to-morrow, and a play the day\r\nafter. Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Magdalen, dropping into a chair and crossing her\r\nhands rapturously on the table, \xe2\x80\x9chow I do like pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! that\xe2\x80\x99s explicit at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Pope\r\nmust have had you in his mind when he wrote his famous lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen some to business, some to pleasure take,\r\nBut every woman is at heart a rake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce she is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Vanstone, entering the room while Miss\r\nGarth was making her quotation, with the dogs at his heels. \xe2\x80\x9cWell; live\r\nand learn. If you\xe2\x80\x99re all rakes, Miss Garth, the sexes are turned\r\ntopsy-turvy with a vengeance; and the men will have nothing left for it\r\nbut to stop at home and darn the stockings.\xe2\x80\x94Let\xe2\x80\x99s have some breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow-d\xe2\x80\x99ye-do, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, taking Mr. Vanstone as boisterously\r\nround the neck as if he belonged to some larger order of Newfoundland\r\ndog, and was made to be romped with at his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s convenience. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthe rake Miss Garth means; and I want to go to another concert\xe2\x80\x94or a\r\nplay, if you like\xe2\x80\x94or a ball, if you prefer it\xe2\x80\x94or anything else in the\r\nway of amusement that puts me into a new dress, and plunges me into a\r\ncrowd of people, and illuminates me with plenty of light, and sets me\r\nin a tingle of excitement all over, from head to foot. Anything will\r\ndo, as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t send us to bed at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanstone sat down composedly under his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s flow of language,\r\nlike a man who was well used to verbal inundation from that quarter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am to be allowed my choice of amusements next time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nworthy gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cI think a play will suit me better than a concert.\r\nThe girls enjoyed themselves amazingly, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\naddressing his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than I did, I must say. It was altogether\r\nabove my mark. They played one piece of music which lasted forty\r\nminutes. It stopped three times, by-the-way; and we all thought it was\r\ndone each time, and clapped our hands, rejoiced to be rid of it. But on\r\nit went again, to our great surprise and mortification, till we gave it\r\nup in despair, and all wished ourselves at Jericho. Norah, my dear!\r\nwhen we had crash-bang for forty minutes, with three stoppages\r\nby-the-way, what did they call it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA symphony, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Norah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you darling old Goth, a symphony by the great Beethoven!\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nMagdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you say you were not amused? Have you forgotten the\r\nyellow-looking foreign woman, with the unpronounceable name? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremember the faces she made when she sang? and the way she courtesied\r\nand courtesied, till she cheated the foolish people into crying encore?\r\nLook here, mamma\xe2\x80\x94look here, Miss Garth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe snatched up an empty plate from the table, to represent a sheet of\r\nmusic, held it before her in the established concert-room position, and\r\nproduced an imitation of the unfortunate singer\xe2\x80\x99s grimaces and\r\ncourtesyings, so accurately and quaintly true to the original, that her\r\nfather roared with laughter; and even the footman (who came in at that\r\nmoment with the post-bag) rushed out of the room again, and committed\r\nthe indecorum of echoing his master audibly on the other side of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLetters, papa. I want the key,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, passing from the\r\nimitation at the breakfast-table to the post-bag on the sideboard with\r\nthe easy abruptness which characterized all her actions.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanstone searched his pockets and shook his head. Though his\r\nyoungest daughter might resemble him in nothing else, it was easy to\r\nsee where Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s unmethodical habits came from.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I have left it in the library, along with my other keys,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and look for it, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really should check Magdalen,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mrs. Vanstone, addressing\r\nher husband when her daughter had left the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThose habits of\r\nmimicry are growing on her; and she speaks to you with a levity which\r\nit is positively shocking to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly what I have said myself, till I am tired of repeating it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nremarked Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cShe treats Mr. Vanstone as if he was a kind of\r\nyounger brother of hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are kind to us in everything else, papa; and you make kind\r\nallowances for Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s high spirits\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the quiet\r\nNorah, taking her father\xe2\x80\x99s part and her sister\xe2\x80\x99s with so little show of\r\nresolution on the surface that few observers would have been sharp\r\nenough to detect the genuine substance beneath it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said good-natured Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for a\r\nvery pretty speech. As for Magdalen,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, addressing his wife\r\nand Miss Garth, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s an unbroken filly. Let her caper and kick in the\r\npaddock to her heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. Time enough to break her to harness\r\nwhen she gets a little older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Magdalen returned with the key. She unlocked the\r\npost-bag at the sideboard and poured out the letters in a heap. Sorting\r\nthem gayly in less than a minute, she approached the breakfast-table\r\nwith both hands full, and delivered the letters all round with the\r\nbusiness-like rapidity of a London postman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo for Norah,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced, beginning with her sister. \xe2\x80\x9cThree for\r\nMiss Garth. None for mamma. One for me. And the other six all for papa.\r\nYou lazy old darling, you hate answering letters, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nMagdalen, dropping the postman\xe2\x80\x99s character and assuming the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you will grumble and fidget in the study! and how you will wish\r\nthere were no such things as letters in the world! and how red your\r\nnice old bald head will get at the top with the worry of writing the\r\nanswers; and how many of the answers you will leave until tomorrow\r\nafter all! _The Bristol Theater\xe2\x80\x99s open, papa,_\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, slyly\r\nand suddenly, in her father\xe2\x80\x99s ear; \xe2\x80\x9cI saw it in the newspaper when I\r\nwent to the library to get the key. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to-morrow night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile his daughter was chattering, Mr. Vanstone was mechanically\r\nsorting his letters. He turned over the first four in succession and\r\nlooked carelessly at the addresses. When he came to the fifth his\r\nattention, which had hitherto wandered toward Magdalen, suddenly became\r\nfixed on the post-mark of the letter.\r\n\r\nStooping over him, with her head on his shoulder, Magdalen could see\r\nthe post-mark as plainly as her father saw it\xe2\x80\x94NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn American letter, papa!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWho do you know at New Orleans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanstone started, and looked eagerly at her husband the moment\r\nMagdalen spoke those words.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanstone said nothing. He quietly removed his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm from\r\nhis neck, as if he wished to be free from all interruption. She\r\nreturned, accordingly, to her place at the breakfast-table. Her father,\r\nwith the letter in his hand, waited a little before he opened it; her\r\nmother looking at him, the while, with an eager, expectant attention\r\nwhich attracted Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and Norah\xe2\x80\x99s, as well as\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or more of hesitation Mr. Vanstone opened the letter.\r\n\r\nHis face changed color the instant he read the first lines; his cheeks\r\nfading to a dull, yellow-brown hue, which would have been ashy paleness\r\nin a less florid man; and his expression becoming saddened and\r\noverclouded in a moment. Norah and Magdalen, watching anxiously, saw\r\nnothing but the change that passed over their father. Miss Garth alone\r\nobserved the effect which that change produced on the attentive\r\nmistress of the house.\r\n\r\nIt was not the effect which she, or any one, could have anticipated.\r\nMrs. Vanstone looked excited rather than alarmed. A faint flush rose on\r\nher cheeks\xe2\x80\x94her eyes brightened\xe2\x80\x94she stirred the tea round and round in\r\nher cup in a restless, impatient manner which was not natural to her.\r\n\r\nMagdalen, in her capacity of spoiled child, was, as usual, the first to\r\nbreak the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ the matter, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanstone, sharply, without looking up at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there must be something,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\r\nis bad news, papa, in that American letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing in the letter that concerns _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nVanstone.\r\n\r\nIt was the first direct rebuff that Magdalen had ever received from her\r\nfather. She looked at him with an incredulous surprise, which would\r\nhave been irresistibly absurd under less serious circumstances.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said. For the first time, perhaps, in their lives, the\r\nfamily sat round the breakfast-table in painful silence. Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhearty morning appetite, like his hearty morning spirits, was gone. He\r\nabsently broke off some morsels of dry toast from the rack near him,\r\nabsently finished his first cup of tea\xe2\x80\x94then asked for a second, which\r\nhe left before him untouched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after an interval, \xe2\x80\x9cyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for me.\r\nMagdalen, my dear, you can go when you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis daughters rose immediately; and Miss Garth considerately followed\r\ntheir example. When an easy-tempered man does assert himself in his\r\nfamily, the rarity of the demonstration invariably has its effect; and\r\nthe will of that easy-tempered man is Law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can have happened?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Norah, as they closed the\r\nbreakfast-room door and crossed the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does papa mean by being cross with Me?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Magdalen,\r\nchafing under a sense of her own injuries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask\xe2\x80\x94what right you had to pry into your father\xe2\x80\x99s private\r\naffairs?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no secrets from papa\xe2\x80\x94what business\r\nhas papa to have secrets from me! I consider myself insulted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you considered yourself properly reproved for not minding your own\r\nbusiness,\xe2\x80\x9d said the plain-spoken Miss Garth, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would be a trifle\r\nnearer the truth. Ah! you are like all the rest of the girls in the\r\npresent day. Not one in a hundred of you knows which end of her\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuppermost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three ladies entered the morning-room; and Magdalen acknowledged\r\nMiss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s reproof by banging the door.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed, and neither Mr. Vanstone nor his wife left the\r\nbreakfast-room. The servant, ignorant of what had happened, went in to\r\nclear the table\xe2\x80\x94found his master and mistress seated close together in\r\ndeep consultation\xe2\x80\x94and immediately went out again. Another quarter of an\r\nhour elapsed before the breakfast-room door was opened, and the private\r\nconference of the husband and wife came to an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear mamma in the hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she is coming to tell\r\nus something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanstone entered the morning-room as her daughter spoke. The color\r\nwas deeper on her cheeks, and the brightness of half-dried tears\r\nglistened in her eyes; her step was more hasty, all her movements were\r\nquicker than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bring news, my dears, which will surprise you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, addressing\r\nher daughters. \xe2\x80\x9cYour father and I are going to London to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen caught her mother by the arm in speechless astonishment. Miss\r\nGarth dropped her work on her lap; even the sedate Norah started to her\r\nfeet, and amazedly repeated the words, \xe2\x80\x9cGoing to London!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout us?\xe2\x80\x9d added Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father and I are going alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, for\r\nas long as three weeks\xe2\x80\x94but not longer. We are going\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she hesitated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nare going on important family business. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold me, Magdalen. This\r\nis a sudden necessity\xe2\x80\x94I have a great deal to do to-day\xe2\x80\x94many things to\r\nset in order before tomorrow. There, there, my love, let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew her arm away; hastily kissed her youngest daughter on the\r\nforehead; and at once left the room again. Even Magdalen saw that her\r\nmother was not to be coaxed into hearing or answering any more\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe morning wore on, and nothing was seen of Mr. Vanstone. With the\r\nreckless curiosity of her age and character, Magdalen, in defiance of\r\nMiss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition and her sister\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrances, determined to\r\ngo to the study and look for her father there. When she tried the door,\r\nit was locked on the inside. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only me, papa;\xe2\x80\x9d and waited\r\nfor the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m busy now, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t disturb\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanstone was, in another way, equally inaccessible. She remained\r\nin her own room, with the female servants about her, immersed in\r\nendless preparations for the approaching departure. The servants,\r\nlittle used in that family to sudden resolutions and unexpected orders,\r\nwere awkward and confused in obeying directions. They ran from room to\r\nroom unnecessarily, and lost time and patience in jostling each other\r\non the stairs. If a stranger had entered the house that day, he might\r\nhave imagined that an unexpected disaster had happened in it, instead\r\nof an unexpected necessity for a journey to London. Nothing proceeded\r\nin its ordinary routine. Magdalen, who was accustomed to pass the\r\nmorning at the piano, wandered restlessly about the staircases and\r\npassages, and in and out of doors when there were glimpses of fine\r\nweather. Norah, whose fondness for reading had passed into a family\r\nproverb, took up book after book from table and shelf, and laid them\r\ndown again, in despair of fixing her attention. Even Miss Garth felt\r\nthe all-pervading influence of the household disorganization, and sat\r\nalone by the morning-room fire, with her head shaking ominously, and\r\nher work laid aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFamily affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Miss Garth, pondering over Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvague explanatory words. \xe2\x80\x9cI have lived twelve years at Combe-Raven; and\r\nthese are the first family affairs which have got between the parents\r\nand the children, in all my experience. What does it mean? Change? I\r\nsuppose I\xe2\x80\x99m getting old. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning Norah and Magdalen stood alone in the\r\nhall at Combe-Raven watching the departure of the carriage which took\r\ntheir father and mother to the London train.\r\n\r\nUp to the last moment, both the sisters had hoped for some explanation\r\nof that mysterious \xe2\x80\x9cfamily business\xe2\x80\x9d to which Mrs. Vanstone had so\r\nbriefly alluded on the previous day. No such explanation had been\r\noffered. Even the agitation of the leave-taking, under circumstances\r\nentirely new in the home experience of the parents and children, had\r\nnot shaken the resolute discretion of Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone. They had\r\ngone\xe2\x80\x94with the warmest testimonies of affection, with farewell embraces\r\nfervently reiterated again and again\xe2\x80\x94but without dropping one word,\r\nfrom first to last, of the nature of their errand.\r\n\r\nAs the grating sound of the carriage-wheels ceased suddenly at a turn\r\nin the road, the sisters looked one another in the face; each feeling,\r\nand each betraying in her own way, the dreary sense that she was openly\r\nexcluded, for the first time, from the confidence of her parents.\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s customary reserve strengthened into sullen silence\xe2\x80\x94she sat down\r\nin one of the hall chairs and looked out frowningly through the open\r\nhouse door. Magdalen, as usual when her temper was ruffled, expressed\r\nher dissatisfaction in the plainest terms. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care who knows it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthink we are both of us shamefully ill-used!\xe2\x80\x9d With those words, the\r\nyoung lady followed her sister\xe2\x80\x99s example by seating herself on a hall\r\nchair and looking aimlessly out through the open house door.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment Miss Garth entered the hall from the\r\nmorning-room. Her quick observation showed her the necessity for\r\ninterfering to some practical purpose; and her ready good sense at once\r\npointed the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook up, both of you, if you please, and listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nGarth. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we are all three to be comfortable and happy together, now\r\nwe are alone, we must stick to our usual habits and go on in our\r\nregular way. There is the state of things in plain words. Accept the\r\nsituation\xe2\x80\x94as the French say. Here am I to set you the example. I have\r\njust ordered an excellent dinner at the customary hour. I am going to\r\nthe medicine-chest next, to physic the kitchen-maid\xe2\x80\x94an unwholesome\r\ngirl, whose face-ache is all stomach. In the meantime, Norah, my dear,\r\nyou will find your work and your books, as usual, in the library.\r\nMagdalen, suppose you leave off tying your handkerchief into knots and\r\nuse your fingers on the keys of the piano instead? We\xe2\x80\x99ll lunch at one,\r\nand take the dogs out afterward. Be as brisk and cheerful both of you\r\nas I am. Come, rouse up directly. If I see those gloomy faces any\r\nlonger, as sure as my name\xe2\x80\x99s Garth, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give your mother written\r\nwarning and go back to my friends by the mixed train at twelve forty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConcluding her address of expostulation in those terms, Miss Garth led\r\nNorah to the library door, pushed Magdalen into the morning-room, and\r\nwent on her own way sternly to the regions of the medicine-chest.\r\n\r\nIn this half-jesting, half-earnest manner she was accustomed to\r\nmaintain a sort of friendly authority over Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters,\r\nafter her proper functions as governess had necessarily come to an end.\r\nNorah, it is needless to say, had long since ceased to be her pupil;\r\nand Magdalen had, by this time, completed her education. But Miss Garth\r\nhad lived too long and too intimately under Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s roof to be\r\nparted with for any purely formal considerations; and the first hint at\r\ngoing away which she had thought it her duty to drop was dismissed with\r\nsuch affectionate warmth of protest that she never repeated it again,\r\nexcept in jest. The entire management of the household was, from that\r\ntime forth, left in her hands; and to those duties she was free to add\r\nwhat companionable assistance she could render to Norah\xe2\x80\x99s reading, and\r\nwhat friendly superintendence she could still exercise over Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmusic. Such were the terms on which Miss Garth was now a resident in\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s family.\r\n\r\nToward the afternoon the weather improved. At half-past one the sun was\r\nshining brightly; and the ladies left the house, accompanied by the\r\ndogs, to set forth on their walk.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the stream, and ascended by the little rocky pass to the\r\nhills beyond; then diverged to the left, and returned by a cross-road\r\nwhich led through the village of Combe-Raven.\r\n\r\nAs they came in sight of the first cottages, they passed a man, hanging\r\nabout the road, who looked attentively, first at Magdalen, then at\r\nNorah. They merely observed that he was short, that he was dressed in\r\nblack, and that he was a total stranger to them\xe2\x80\x94and continued their\r\nhomeward walk, without thinking more about the loitering foot-passenger\r\nwhom they had met on their way back.\r\n\r\nAfter they had left the village, and had entered the road which led\r\nstraight to the house, Magdalen surprised Miss Garth by announcing that\r\nthe stranger in black had turned, after they had passed him, and was\r\nnow following them. \xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s side of the road,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nmischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not the attraction\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t blame _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether the man was really following them, or not, made little\r\ndifference, for they were now close to the house. As they passed\r\nthrough the lodge-gates, Miss Garth looked round, and saw that the\r\nstranger was quickening his pace, apparently with the purpose of\r\nentering into conversation. Seeing this, she at once directed the young\r\nladies to go on to the house with the dogs, while she herself waited\r\nfor events at the gate.\r\n\r\nThere was just time to complete this discreet arrangement, before the\r\nstranger reached the lodge. He took off his hat to Miss Garth politely,\r\nas she turned round. What did he look like, on the face of him? He\r\nlooked like a clergyman in difficulties.\r\n\r\nTaking his portrait, from top to toe, the picture of him began with a\r\ntall hat, broadly encircled by a mourning band of crumpled crape. Below\r\nthe hat was a lean, long, sallow face, deeply pitted with the smallpox,\r\nand characterized, very remarkably, by eyes of two different colors\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nbilious green, one bilious brown, both sharply intelligent. His hair\r\nwas iron-gray, carefully brushed round at the temples. His cheeks and\r\nchin were in the bluest bloom of smooth shaving; his nose was short\r\nRoman; his lips long, thin, and supple, curled up at the corners with a\r\nmildly-humorous smile. His white cravat was high, stiff, and dingy; the\r\ncollar, higher, stiffer, and dingier, projected its rigid points on\r\neither side beyond his chin. Lower down, the lithe little figure of the\r\nman was arrayed throughout in sober-shabby black. His frock-coat was\r\nbuttoned tight round the waist, and left to bulge open majestically at\r\nthe chest. His hands were covered with black cotton gloves neatly\r\ndarned at the fingers; his umbrella, worn down at the ferule to the\r\nlast quarter of an inch, was carefully preserved, nevertheless, in an\r\noilskin case. The front view of him was the view in which he looked\r\noldest; meeting him face to face, he might have been estimated at fifty\r\nor more. Walking behind him, his back and shoulders were almost young\r\nenough to have passed for five-and-thirty. His manners were\r\ndistinguished by a grave serenity. When he opened his lips, he spoke in\r\na rich bass voice, with an easy flow of language, and a strict\r\nattention to the elocutionary claims of words in more than one\r\nsyllable. Persuasion distilled from his mildly-curling lips; and,\r\nshabby as he was, perennial flowers of courtesy bloomed all over him\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the residence of Mr. Vanstone, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d he began, with a\r\ncircular wave of his hand in the direction of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I the\r\nhonor of addressing a member of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the plain-spoken Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are addressing Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s governess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe persuasive man fell back a step\xe2\x80\x94admired Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoverness\xe2\x80\x94advanced a step again\xe2\x80\x94and continued the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the two young ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthe two young ladies who were\r\nwalking with you are doubtless Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters? I recognized\r\nthe darker of the two, and the elder as I apprehend, by her likeness to\r\nher handsome mother. The younger lady\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are acquainted with Mrs. Vanstone, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth,\r\ninterrupting the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s flow of language, which, all things\r\nconsidered, was beginning, in her opinion, to flow rather freely. The\r\nstranger acknowledged the interruption by one of his polite bows, and\r\nsubmerged Miss Garth in his next sentence as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe younger lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9ctakes after her father, I presume? I\r\nassure you, her face struck me. Looking at it with my friendly interest\r\nin the family, I thought it very remarkable. I said to myself\xe2\x80\x94Charming,\r\nCharacteristic, Memorable. Not like her sister, not like her mother. No\r\ndoubt, the image of her father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Miss Garth attempted to stem the man\xe2\x80\x99s flow of words. It was\r\nplain that he did not know Mr. Vanstone, even by sight\xe2\x80\x94otherwise he\r\nwould never have committed the error of supposing that Magdalen took\r\nafter her father. Did he know Mrs. Vanstone any better? He had left\r\nMiss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s question on that point unanswered. In the name of wonder,\r\nwho was he? Powers of impudence! what did he want?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be a friend of the family, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember your face,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat may your commands be, if you please? Did you\r\ncome here to pay Mrs. Vanstone a visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had anticipated the pleasure of communicating with Mrs. Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered this inveterately evasive and inveterately civil man. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth, feeling her resources of politeness\r\nfast failing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut for long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone to London with Mr. Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s long face suddenly grew longer. His bilious brown eye looked\r\ndisconcerted, and his bilious green eye followed its example. His\r\nmanner became palpably anxious; and his choice of words was more\r\ncarefully selected than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s absence likely to extend over any very lengthened\r\nperiod?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will extend over three weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\r\nhave now asked me questions enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, beginning to let her\r\ntemper get the better of her at last. \xe2\x80\x9cBe so good, if you please, as to\r\nmention your business and your name. If you have any message to leave\r\nfor Mrs. Vanstone, I shall be writing to her by to-night\xe2\x80\x99s post, and I\r\ncan take charge of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand thanks! A most valuable suggestion. Permit me to take\r\nadvantage of it immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not in the least affected by the severity of Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s looks\r\nand language\xe2\x80\x94he was simply relieved by her proposal, and he showed it\r\nwith the most engaging sincerity. This time his bilious green eye took\r\nthe initiative, and set his bilious brown eye the example of recovered\r\nserenity. His curling lips took a new twist upward; he tucked his\r\numbrella briskly under his arm; and produced from the breast of his\r\ncoat a large old-fashioned black pocketbook. From this he took a pencil\r\nand a card\xe2\x80\x94hesitated and considered for a moment\xe2\x80\x94wrote rapidly on the\r\ncard\xe2\x80\x94and placed it, with the politest alacrity, in Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall feel personally obliged if you will honor me by inclosing that\r\ncard in your letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity for my troubling\r\nyou additionally with a message. My name will be quite sufficient to\r\nrecall a little family matter to Mrs. Vanstone, which has no doubt\r\nescaped her memory. Accept my best thanks. This has been a day of\r\nagreeable surprises to me. I have found the country hereabouts\r\nremarkably pretty; I have seen Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s two charming daughters;\r\nI have become acquainted with an honored preceptress in Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily. I congratulate myself\xe2\x80\x94I apologize for occupying your valuable\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94I beg my renewed acknowledgments\xe2\x80\x94I wish you good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his tall hat. His brown eye twinkled, his green eye twinkled,\r\nhis curly lips smiled sweetly. In a moment he turned on his heel. His\r\nyouthful back appeared to the best advantage; his active little legs\r\ntook him away trippingly in the direction of the village. One, two,\r\nthree\xe2\x80\x94and he reached the turn in the road. Four, five, six\xe2\x80\x94and he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nMiss Garth looked down at the card in her hand, and looked up again in\r\nblank astonishment. The name and address of the clerical-looking\r\nstranger (both written in pencil) ran as follows:\r\n\r\n_Captain Wragge. Post-office, Bristol._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to the house, Miss Garth made no attempt to conceal\r\nher unfavorable opinion of the stranger in black. His object was, no\r\ndoubt, to obtain pecuniary assistance from Mrs. Vanstone. What the\r\nnature of his claim on her might be seemed less intelligible\xe2\x80\x94unless it\r\nwas the claim of a poor relation. Had Mrs. Vanstone ever mentioned, in\r\nthe presence of her daughters, the name of Captain Wragge? Neither of\r\nthem recollected to have heard it before. Had Mrs. Vanstone ever\r\nreferred to any poor relations who were dependent on her? On the\r\ncontrary she had mentioned of late years that she doubted having any\r\nrelations at all who were still living. And yet Captain Wragge had\r\nplainly declared that the name on his card would recall \xe2\x80\x9ca family\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x9d to Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s memory. What did it mean? A false statement,\r\non the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s part, without any intelligible reason for making it?\r\nOr a second mystery, following close on the heels of the mysterious\r\njourney to London?\r\n\r\nAll the probabilities seemed to point to some hidden connection between\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cfamily affairs\xe2\x80\x9d which had taken Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone so suddenly\r\nfrom home and the \xe2\x80\x9cfamily matter\xe2\x80\x9d associated with the name of Captain\r\nWragge. Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s doubts thronged back irresistibly on her mind as\r\nshe sealed her letter to Mrs. Vanstone, with the captain\xe2\x80\x99s card added\r\nby way of inclosure.\r\n\r\nBy return of post the answer arrived.\r\n\r\nAlways the earliest riser among the ladies of the house, Miss Garth was\r\nalone in the breakfast-room when the letter was brought in. Her first\r\nglance at its contents convinced her of the necessity of reading it\r\ncarefully through in retirement, before any embarrassing questions\r\ncould be put to her. Leaving a message with the servant requesting\r\nNorah to make the tea that morning, she went upstairs at once to the\r\nsolitude and security of her own room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s letter extended to some length. The first part of it\r\nreferred to Captain Wragge, and entered unreservedly into all necessary\r\nexplanations relating to the man himself and to the motive which had\r\nbrought him to Combe-Raven.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s statement that her mother had been\r\ntwice married. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s first husband had been a certain Doctor\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x94a widower with young children; and one of those children was now\r\nthe unmilitary-looking captain, whose address was \xe2\x80\x9cPost-office,\r\nBristol.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Wragge had left no family by her first husband; and had\r\nafterward married Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s father. Of that second marriage Mrs.\r\nVanstone herself was the only issue. She had lost both her parents\r\nwhile she was still a young woman; and, in course of years, her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s family connections (who were then her nearest surviving\r\nrelatives) had been one after another removed by death. She was left,\r\nat the present writing, without a relation in the world\xe2\x80\x94excepting,\r\nperhaps, certain cousins whom she had never seen, and of whose\r\nexistence even, at the present moment, she possessed no positive\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, what family claim had Captain Wragge on Mrs.\r\nVanstone?\r\n\r\nNone whatever. As the son of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s first husband, by that\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s first wife, not even the widest stretch of courtesy could\r\nhave included him at any time in the list of Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\ndistant relations. Well knowing this (the letter proceeded to say), he\r\nhad nevertheless persisted in forcing himself upon her as a species of\r\nfamily connection: and she had weakly sanctioned the intrusion, solely\r\nfrom the dread that he would otherwise introduce himself to Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and take unblushing advantage of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerosity. Shrinking, naturally, from allowing her husband to be\r\nannoyed, and probably cheated as well, by any person who claimed,\r\nhowever preposterously, a family connection with herself, it had been\r\nher practice, for many years past, to assist the captain from her own\r\npurse, on the condition that he should never come near the house, and\r\nthat he should not presume to make any application whatever to Mr.\r\nVanstone.\r\n\r\nReadily admitting the imprudence of this course, Mrs. Vanstone further\r\nexplained that she had perhaps been the more inclined to adopt it\r\nthrough having been always accustomed, in her early days, to see the\r\ncaptain living now upon one member, and now upon another, of her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s family. Possessed of abilities which might have raised him to\r\ndistinction in almost any career that he could have chosen, he had\r\nnevertheless, from his youth upward, been a disgrace to all his\r\nrelatives. He had been expelled the militia regiment in which he once\r\nheld a commission. He had tried one employment after another, and had\r\ndiscreditably failed in all. He had lived on his wits, in the lowest\r\nand basest meaning of the phrase. He had married a poor ignorant woman,\r\nwho had served as a waitress at some low eating-house, who had\r\nunexpectedly come into a little money, and whose small inheritance he\r\nhad mercilessly squandered to the last farthing. In plain terms, he was\r\nan incorrigible scoundrel; and he had now added one more to the list of\r\nhis many misdemeanors by impudently breaking the conditions on which\r\nMrs. Vanstone had hitherto assisted him. She had written at once to the\r\naddress indicated on his card, in such terms and to such purpose as\r\nwould prevent him, she hoped and believed, from ever venturing near the\r\nhouse again. Such were the terms in which Mrs. Vanstone concluded that\r\nfirst part of her letter which referred exclusively to Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\nAlthough the statement thus presented implied a weakness in Mrs.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s character which Miss Garth, after many years of intimate\r\nexperience, had never detected, she accepted the explanation as a\r\nmatter of course; receiving it all the more readily inasmuch as it\r\nmight, without impropriety, be communicated in substance to appease the\r\nirritated curiosity of the two young ladies. For this reason especially\r\nshe perused the first half of the letter with an agreeable sense of\r\nrelief. Far different was the impression produced on her when she\r\nadvanced to the second half, and when she had read it to the end.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the letter was devoted to the subject of the journey\r\nto London.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanstone began by referring to the long and intimate friendship\r\nwhich had existed between Miss Garth and herself. She now felt it due\r\nto that friendship to explain confidentially the motive which had\r\ninduced her to leave home with her husband. Miss Garth had delicately\r\nrefrained from showing it, but she must naturally have felt, and must\r\nstill be feeling, great surprise at the mystery in which their\r\ndeparture had been involved; and she must doubtless have asked herself\r\nwhy Mrs. Vanstone should have been associated with family affairs which\r\n(in her independent position as to relatives) must necessarily concern\r\nMr. Vanstone alone.\r\n\r\nWithout touching on those affairs, which it was neither desirable nor\r\nnecessary to do, Mrs. Vanstone then proceeded to say that she would at\r\nonce set all Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s doubts at rest, so far as they related to\r\nherself, by one plain acknowledgment. Her object in accompanying her\r\nhusband to London was to see a certain celebrated physician, and to\r\nconsult him privately on a very delicate and anxious matter connected\r\nwith the state of her health. In plainer terms still, this anxious\r\nmatter meant nothing less than the possibility that she might again\r\nbecome a mother.\r\n\r\nWhen the doubt had first suggested itself she had treated it as a mere\r\ndelusion. The long interval that had elapsed since the birth of her\r\nlast child; the serious illness which had afflicted her after the death\r\nof that child in infancy; the time of life at which she had now\r\narrived\xe2\x80\x94all inclined her to dismiss the idea as soon as it arose in her\r\nmind. It had returned again and again in spite of her. She had felt the\r\nnecessity of consulting the highest medical authority; and had shrunk,\r\nat the same time, from alarming her daughters by summoning a London\r\nphysician to the house. The medical opinion, sought under the\r\ncircumstances already mentioned, had now been obtained. Her doubt was\r\nconfirmed as a certainty; and the result, which might be expected to\r\ntake place toward the end of the summer, was, at her age and with her\r\nconstitutional peculiarities, a subject for serious future anxiety, to\r\nsay the least of it. The physician had done his best to encourage her;\r\nbut she had understood the drift of his questions more clearly than he\r\nsupposed, and she knew that he looked to the future with more than\r\nordinary doubt.\r\n\r\nHaving disclosed these particulars, Mrs. Vanstone requested that they\r\nmight be kept a secret between her correspondent and herself. She had\r\nfelt unwilling to mention her suspicions to Miss Garth, until those\r\nsuspicions had been confirmed\xe2\x80\x94and she now recoiled, with even greater\r\nreluctance, from allowing her daughters to be in any way alarmed about\r\nher. It would be best to dismiss the subject for the present, and to\r\nwait hopefully till the summer came. In the meantime they would all,\r\nshe trusted, be happily reunited on the twenty-third of the month,\r\nwhich Mr. Vanstone had fixed on as the day for their return. With this\r\nintimation, and with the customary messages, the letter, abruptly and\r\nconfusedly, came to an end.\r\n\r\nFor the first few minutes, a natural sympathy for Mrs. Vanstone was the\r\nonly feeling of which Miss Garth was conscious after she had laid the\r\nletter down. Ere long, however, there rose obscurely on her mind a\r\ndoubt which perplexed and distressed her. Was the explanation which she\r\nhad just read really as satisfactory and as complete as it professed to\r\nbe? Testing it plainly by facts, surely not.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of her departure, Mrs. Vanstone had unquestionably left\r\nthe house in good spirits. At her age, and in her state of health, were\r\ngood spirits compatible with such an errand to a physician as the\r\nerrand on which she was bent? Then, again, had that letter from New\r\nOrleans, which had necessitated Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s departure, no share in\r\noccasioning his wife\xe2\x80\x99s departure as well? Why, otherwise, had she\r\nlooked up so eagerly the moment her daughter mentioned the postmark.\r\nGranting the avowed motive for her journey\xe2\x80\x94did not her manner, on the\r\nmorning when the letter was opened, and again on the morning of\r\ndeparture, suggest the existence of some other motive which her letter\r\nkept concealed?\r\n\r\nIf it was so, the conclusion that followed was a very distressing one.\r\nMrs. Vanstone, feeling what was due to her long friendship with Miss\r\nGarth, had apparently placed the fullest confidence in her, on one\r\nsubject, by way of unsuspiciously maintaining the strictest reserve\r\ntoward her on another. Naturally frank and straightforward in all her\r\nown dealings, Miss Garth shrank from plainly pursuing her doubts to\r\nthis result: a want of loyalty toward her tried and valued friend\r\nseemed implied in the mere dawning of it on her mind.\r\n\r\nShe locked up the letter in her desk; roused herself resolutely to\r\nattend to the passing interests of the day; and went downstairs again\r\nto the breakfast-room. Amid many uncertainties, this at least was\r\nclear, Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone were coming back on the twenty-third of\r\nthe month. Who could say what new revelations might not come back with\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNo new revelations came back with them: no anticipations associated\r\nwith their return were realized. On the one forbidden subject of their\r\nerrand in London, there was no moving either the master or the mistress\r\nof the house. Whatever their object might have been, they had to all\r\nappearance successfully accomplished it\xe2\x80\x94for they both returned in\r\nperfect possession of their every-day looks and manners. Mrs.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s spirits had subsided to their natural quiet level; Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s imperturbable cheerfulness sat as easily and indolently on\r\nhim as usual. This was the one noticeable result of their journey\xe2\x80\x94this,\r\nand no more. Had the household revolution run its course already? Was\r\nthe secret thus far hidden impenetrably, hidden forever?\r\n\r\nNothing in this world is hidden forever. The gold which has lain for\r\ncenturies unsuspected in the ground, reveals itself one day on the\r\nsurface. Sand turns traitor, and betrays the footstep that has passed\r\nover it; water gives back to the tell-tale surface the body that has\r\nbeen drowned. Fire itself leaves the confession, in ashes, of the\r\nsubstance consumed in it. Hate breaks its prison-secrecy in the\r\nthoughts, through the doorway of the eyes; and Love finds the Judas who\r\nbetrays it by a kiss. Look where we will, the inevitable law of\r\nrevelation is one of the laws of nature: the lasting preservation of a\r\nsecret is a miracle which the world has never yet seen.\r\n\r\nHow was the secret now hidden in the household at Combe-Raven doomed to\r\ndisclose itself? Through what coming event in the daily lives of the\r\nfather, the mother, and the daughters, was the law of revelation\r\ndestined to break the fatal way to discovery? The way opened (unseen by\r\nthe parents, and unsuspected by the children) through the first event\r\nthat happened after Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s return\xe2\x80\x94an event which\r\npresented, on the surface of it, no interest of greater importance than\r\nthe trivial social ceremony of a morning call.\r\n\r\nThree days after the master and mistress of Combe-Raven had come back,\r\nthe female members of the family happened to be assembled together in\r\nthe morning-room. The view from the windows looked over the\r\nflower-garden and shrubbery; this last being protected at its outward\r\nextremity by a fence, and approached from the lane beyond by a\r\nwicket-gate. During an interval in the conversation, the attention of\r\nthe ladies was suddenly attracted to this gate, by the sharp sound of\r\nthe iron latch falling in its socket. Some one had entered the\r\nshrubbery from the lane; and Magdalen at once placed herself at the\r\nwindow to catch the first sight of the visitor through the trees.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, the figure of a gentleman became visible, at the\r\npoint where the shrubbery path joined the winding garden-walk which led\r\nto the house. Magdalen looked at him attentively, without appearing, at\r\nfirst, to know who he was. As he came nearer, however, she started in\r\nastonishment; and, turning quickly to her mother and sister, proclaimed\r\nthe gentleman in the garden to be no other than \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Francis Clare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitor thus announced was the son of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s oldest\r\nassociate and nearest neighbor.\r\n\r\nMr. Clare the elder inhabited an unpretending little cottage, situated\r\njust outside the shrubbery fence which marked the limit of the\r\nCombe-Raven grounds. Belonging to the younger branch of a family of\r\ngreat antiquity, the one inheritance of importance that he had derived\r\nfrom his ancestors was the possession of a magnificent library, which\r\nnot only filled all the rooms in his modest little dwelling, but lined\r\nthe staircases and passages as well. Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s books represented the\r\none important interest of Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s life. He had been a widower for\r\nmany years past, and made no secret of his philosophical resignation to\r\nthe loss of his wife. As a father, he regarded his family of three sons\r\nin the light of a necessary domestic evil, which perpetually threatened\r\nthe sanctity of his study and the safety of his books. When the boys\r\nwent to school, Mr. Clare said \xe2\x80\x9cgood-by\xe2\x80\x9d to them\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9cthank God\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nhimself. As for his small income, and his still smaller domestic\r\nestablishment, he looked at them both from the same satirically\r\nindifferent point of view. He called himself a pauper with a pedigree.\r\nHe abandoned the entire direction of his household to the slatternly\r\nold woman who was his only servant, on the condition that she was never\r\nto venture near his books, with a duster in her hand, from one year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend to the other. His favorite poets were Horace and Pope; his chosen\r\nphilosophers, Hobbes and Voltaire. He took his exercise and his fresh\r\nair under protest; and always walked the same distance to a yard, on\r\nthe ugliest high-road in the neighborhood. He was crooked of back, and\r\nquick of temper. He could digest radishes, and sleep after green tea.\r\nHis views of human nature were the views of Diogenes, tempered by\r\nRochefoucauld; his personal habits were slovenly in the last degree;\r\nand his favorite boast was that he had outlived all human prejudices.\r\n\r\nSuch was this singular man, in his more superficial aspects. What\r\nnobler qualities he might possess below the surface, no one had ever\r\ndiscovered. Mr. Vanstone, it is true, stoutly asserted that \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nClare\xe2\x80\x99s worst side was his outside\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but in this expression of opinion\r\nhe stood alone among his neighbors. The association between these two\r\nwidely-dissimilar men had lasted for many years, and was almost close\r\nenough to be called a friendship. They had acquired a habit of meeting\r\nto smoke together on certain evenings in the week, in the\r\ncynic-philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s study, and of there disputing on every imaginable\r\nsubject\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Vanstone flourishing the stout cudgels of assertion, and\r\nMr. Clare meeting him with the keen edged-tools of sophistry. They\r\ngenerally quarreled at night, and met on the neutral ground of the\r\nshrubbery to be reconciled together the next morning. The bond of\r\nintercourse thus curiously established between them was strengthened on\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s side by a hearty interest in his neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s three\r\nsons\xe2\x80\x94an interest by which those sons benefited all the more\r\nimportantly, seeing that one of the prejudices which their father had\r\noutlived was a prejudice in favor of his own children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI look at those boys,\xe2\x80\x9d the philosopher was accustomed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a\r\nperfectly impartial eye; I dismiss the unimportant accident of their\r\nbirth from all consideration; and I find them below the average in\r\nevery respect. The only excuse which a poor gentleman has for presuming\r\nto exist in the nineteenth century, is the excuse of extraordinary\r\nability. My boys have been addle-headed from infancy. If I had any\r\ncapital to give them, I should make Frank a butcher, Cecil a baker, and\r\nArthur a grocer\xe2\x80\x94those being the only human vocations I know of which\r\nare certain to be always in request. As it is, I have no money to help\r\nthem with; and they have no brains to help themselves. They appear to\r\nme to be three human superfluities in dirty jackets and noisy boots;\r\nand, unless they clear themselves off the community by running away, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t myself profess to see what is to be done with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFortunately for the boys, Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s views were still fast\r\nimprisoned in the ordinary prejudices. At his intercession, and through\r\nhis influence, Frank, Cecil, and Arthur were received on the foundation\r\nof a well-reputed grammar-school. In holiday-time they were mercifully\r\nallowed the run of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s paddock; and were humanized and\r\nrefined by association, indoors, with Mrs. Vanstone and her daughters.\r\nOn these occasions, Mr. Clare used sometimes to walk across from his\r\ncottage (in his dressing-gown and slippers), and look at the boys\r\ndisparagingly, through the window or over the fence, as if they were\r\nthree wild animals whom his neighbor was attempting to tame. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and\r\nyour wife are excellent people,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say to Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nrespect your honest prejudices in favor of those boys of mine with all\r\nmy heart. But you are _so_ wrong about them\xe2\x80\x94you are indeed! I wish to\r\ngive no offense; I speak quite impartially\xe2\x80\x94but mark my words, Vanstone:\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll all three turn out ill, in spite of everything you can do to\r\nprevent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn later years, when Frank had reached the age of seventeen, the same\r\ncurious shifting of the relative positions of parent and friend between\r\nthe two neighbors was exemplified more absurdly than ever. A civil\r\nengineer in the north of England, who owed certain obligations to Mr.\r\nVanstone, expressed his willingness to take Frank under\r\nsuperintendence, on terms of the most favorable kind. When this\r\nproposal was received, Mr. Clare, as usual, first shifted his own\r\ncharacter as Frank\xe2\x80\x99s father on Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nmoderated his neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s parental enthusiasm from the point of view of\r\nan impartial spectator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the finest chance for Frank that could possibly have happened,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Mr. Vanstone, in a glow of fatherly enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow, he won\xe2\x80\x99t take it,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Clare, with the icy\r\ncomposure of a disinterested friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he _shall_ take it,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Mr. Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay he shall have a mathematical head,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9csay he\r\nshall possess industry, ambition, and firmness of purpose. Pooh! pooh!\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t look at him with my impartial eyes. I say, No mathematics, no\r\nindustry, no ambition, no firmness of purpose. Frank is a compound of\r\nnegatives\xe2\x80\x94and there they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang your negatives!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a rush for\r\nnegatives, or affirmatives either. Frank shall have this splendid\r\nchance; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay you any wager you like he makes the best of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not rich enough to lay wagers, usually,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Clare; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nI think I have got a guinea about the house somewhere; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay you\r\nthat guinea Frank comes back on our hands like a bad shilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cNo: stop a minute! I won\xe2\x80\x99t do the lad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter the injustice of backing it at even money. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay you five\r\nto one Frank turns up trumps in this business! You ought to be ashamed\r\nof yourself for talking of him as you do. What sort of hocus-pocus you\r\nbring it about by, I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know; but you always end in\r\nmaking me take his part, as if I was his father instead of you. Ah yes!\r\ngive you time, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll defend yourself. I won\xe2\x80\x99t give you time; I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have any of your special pleading. Black\xe2\x80\x99s white according to\r\nyou. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care: it\xe2\x80\x99s black for all that. You may talk nineteen to\r\nthe dozen\xe2\x80\x94I shall write to my friend and say Yes, in Frank\xe2\x80\x99s interests,\r\nby to-day\xe2\x80\x99s post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances under which Mr. Francis Clare departed for\r\nthe north of England, at the age of seventeen, to start in life as a\r\ncivil engineer.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s friend communicated with him on the\r\nsubject of the new pupil. Frank was praised, as a quiet,\r\ngentleman-like, interesting lad\xe2\x80\x94but he was also reported to be rather\r\nslow at acquiring the rudiments of engineering science. Other letters,\r\nlater in date, described him as a little too ready to despond about\r\nhimself; as having been sent away, on that account, to some new railway\r\nworks, to see if change of scene would rouse him; and as having\r\nbenefited in every respect by the experiment\xe2\x80\x94except perhaps in regard\r\nto his professional studies, which still advanced but slowly.\r\nSubsequent communications announced his departure, under care of a\r\ntrustworthy foreman, for some public works in Belgium; touched on the\r\ngeneral benefit he appeared to derive from this new change; praised his\r\nexcellent manners and address, which were of great assistance in\r\nfacilitating business communications with the foreigners\xe2\x80\x94and passed\r\nover in ominous silence the main question of his actual progress in the\r\nacquirement of knowledge. These reports, and many others which\r\nresembled them, were all conscientiously presented by Frank\xe2\x80\x99s friend to\r\nthe attention of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s father. On each occasion, Mr. Clare exulted\r\nover Mr. Vanstone, and Mr. Vanstone quarreled with Mr. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of\r\nthese days you\xe2\x80\x99ll wish you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t laid that wager,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cynic\r\nphilosopher. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of these days I shall have the blessed satisfaction\r\nof pocketing your guinea,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sanguine friend. Two years had\r\nthen passed since Frank\xe2\x80\x99s departure. In one year more results asserted\r\nthemselves, and settled the question.\r\n\r\nTwo days after Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s return from London, he was called away\r\nfrom the breakfast-table before he had found time enough to look over\r\nhis letters, delivered by the morning\xe2\x80\x99s post. Thrusting them into one\r\nof the pockets of his shooting-jacket, he took the letters out again,\r\nat one grasp, to read them when occasion served, later in the day. The\r\ngrasp included the whole correspondence, with one exception\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nexception being a final report from the civil engineer, which notified\r\nthe termination of the connection between his pupil and himself, and\r\nthe immediate return of Frank to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nWhile this important announcement lay unsuspected in Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npocket, the object of it was traveling home, as fast as railways could\r\ntake him. At half-past ten at night, while Mr. Clare was sitting in\r\nstudious solitude over his books and his green tea, with his favorite\r\nblack cat to keep him company, he heard footsteps in the passage\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndoor opened\xe2\x80\x94and Frank stood before him.\r\n\r\nOrdinary men would have been astonished. But the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomposure was not to be shaken by any such trifle as the unexpected\r\nreturn of his eldest son. He could not have looked up more calmly from\r\nhis learned volume if Frank had been absent for three minutes instead\r\nof three years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly what I predicted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me by\r\nmaking explanations; and don\xe2\x80\x99t frighten the cat. If there is anything\r\nto eat in the kitchen, get it and go to bed. You can walk over to\r\nCombe-Raven tomorrow and give this message from me to Mr. Vanstone:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, sir, and I have come back upon your hands like a\r\nbad shilling, as he always said I should. He keeps his own guinea, and\r\ntakes your five; and he hopes you\xe2\x80\x99ll mind what he says to you another\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99 That is the message. Shut the door after you. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder these unfavorable auspices, Mr. Francis Clare made his appearance\r\nthe next morning in the grounds at Combe-Raven; and, something doubtful\r\nof the reception that might await him, slowly approached the precincts\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nIt was not wonderful that Magdalen should have failed to recognize him\r\nwhen he first appeared in view. He had gone away a backward lad of\r\nseventeen; he returned a young man of twenty. His slim figure had now\r\nacquired strength and grace, and had increased in stature to the medium\r\nheight. The small regular features, which he was supposed to have\r\ninherited from his mother, were rounded and filled out, without having\r\nlost their remarkable delicacy of form. His beard was still in its\r\ninfancy; and nascent lines of whisker traced their modest way sparely\r\ndown his cheeks. His gentle, wandering brown eyes would have looked to\r\nbetter advantage in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94they wanted spirit and firmness to\r\nfit them for the face of a man. His hands had the same wandering habit\r\nas his eyes; they were constantly changing from one position to\r\nanother, constantly twisting and turning any little stray thing they\r\ncould pick up. He was undeniably handsome, graceful, well-bred\xe2\x80\x94but no\r\nclose observer could look at him without suspecting that the stout old\r\nfamily stock had begun to wear out in the later generations, and that\r\nMr. Francis Clare had more in him of the shadow of his ancestors than\r\nof the substance.\r\n\r\nWhen the astonishment caused by his appearance had partially subsided,\r\na search was instituted for the missing report. It was found in the\r\nremotest recesses of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s capacious pocket, and was read by\r\nthat gentleman on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe plain facts, as stated by the engineer, were briefly these: Frank\r\nwas not possessed of the necessary abilities to fit him for his new\r\ncalling; and it was useless to waste time by keeping him any longer in\r\nan employment for which he had no vocation. This, after three years\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntrial, being the conviction on both sides, the master had thought it\r\nthe most straightforward course for the pupil to go home and candidly\r\nplace results before his father and his friends. In some other pursuit,\r\nfor which he was more fit, and in which he could feel an interest, he\r\nwould no doubt display the industry and perseverance which he had been\r\ntoo much discouraged to practice in the profession that he had now\r\nabandoned. Personally, he was liked by all who knew him; and his future\r\nprosperity was heartily desired by the many friends whom he had made in\r\nthe North. Such was the substance of the report, and so it came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nMany men would have thought the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s statement rather too\r\ncarefully worded; and, suspecting him of trying to make the best of a\r\nbad case, would have entertained serious doubts on the subject of\r\nFrank\xe2\x80\x99s future. Mr. Vanstone was too easy-tempered and sanguine\xe2\x80\x94and too\r\nanxious, as well, not to yield his old antagonist an inch more ground\r\nthan he could help\xe2\x80\x94to look at the letter from any such unfavorable\r\npoint of view. Was it Frank\xe2\x80\x99s fault if he had not got the stuff in him\r\nthat engineers were made of? Did no other young men ever begin life\r\nwith a false start? Plenty began in that way, and got over it, and did\r\nwonders afterward. With these commentaries on the letter, the\r\nkind-hearted gentleman patted Frank on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cCheer up, my\r\nlad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will be even with your father one of these\r\ndays, though he _has_ won the wager this time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe example thus set by the master of the house was followed at once by\r\nthe family\xe2\x80\x94with the solitary exception of Norah, whose incurable\r\nformality and reserve expressed themselves, not too graciously, in her\r\ndistant manner toward the visitor. The rest, led by Magdalen (who had\r\nbeen Frank\xe2\x80\x99s favorite playfellow in past times) glided back into their\r\nold easy habits with him without an effort. He was \xe2\x80\x9cFrank\xe2\x80\x9d with all of\r\nthem but Norah, who persisted in addressing him as \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Clare.\xe2\x80\x9d Even\r\nthe account he was now encouraged to give of the reception accorded to\r\nhim by his father, on the previous night, failed to disturb Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngravity. She sat with her dark, handsome face steadily averted, her\r\neyes cast down, and the rich color in her cheeks warmer and deeper than\r\nusual. All the rest, Miss Garth included, found old Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s speech\r\nof welcome to his son quite irresistible. The noise and merriment were\r\nat their height when the servant came in, and struck the whole party\r\ndumb by the announcement of visitors in the drawing-room. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nMarrable, Mrs. Marrable, and Miss Marrable; Evergreen Lodge, Clifton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah rose as readily as if the new arrivals had been a relief to her\r\nmind. Mrs. Vanstone was the next to leave her chair. These two went\r\naway first, to receive the visitors. Magdalen, who preferred the\r\nsociety of her father and Frank, pleaded hard to be left behind; but\r\nMiss Garth, after granting five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 grace, took her into custody\r\nand marched her out of the room. Frank rose to take his leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanstone, detaining him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go. These people\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t stop long. Mr. Marrable\xe2\x80\x99s a merchant at Bristol. I\xe2\x80\x99ve met him\r\nonce or twice, when the girls forced me to take them to parties at\r\nClifton. Mere acquaintances, nothing more. Come and smoke a cigar in\r\nthe greenhouse. Hang all visitors\xe2\x80\x94they worry one\xe2\x80\x99s life out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nappear at the last moment with an apology; and you shall follow me at a\r\nsafe distance, and be a proof that I was really engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProposing this ingenious stratagem in a confidential whisper, Mr.\r\nVanstone took Frank\xe2\x80\x99s arm and led him round the house by the back way.\r\nThe first ten minutes of seclusion in the conservatory passed without\r\nevents of any kind. At the end of that time, a flying figure in bright\r\ngarments flashed upon the two gentlemen through the glass\xe2\x80\x94the door was\r\nflung open\xe2\x80\x94flower-pots fell in homage to passing petticoats\xe2\x80\x94and Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s youngest daughter ran up to him at headlong speed, with\r\nevery external appearance of having suddenly taken leave of her senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! the dream of my whole life is realized,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as soon as\r\nshe could speak. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall fly through the roof of the greenhouse if\r\nsomebody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold me down. The Marrables have come here with an\r\ninvitation. Guess, you darling\xe2\x80\x94guess what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to give at\r\nEvergreen Lodge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ball!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanstone, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate Theatricals!!!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Magdalen, her clear young voice ringing\r\nthrough the conservatory like a bell; her loose sleeves falling back\r\nand showing her round white arms to the dimpled elbows, as she clapped\r\nher hands ecstatically in the air. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Rivals\xe2\x80\x99 is the play, papa\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98The\r\nRivals,\xe2\x80\x99 by the famous what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name\xe2\x80\x94and they want ME to act! The one\r\nthing in the whole universe that I long to do most. It all depends on\r\nyou. Mamma shakes her head; and Miss Garth looks daggers; and Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas sulky as usual\xe2\x80\x94but if you say Yes, they must all three give way and\r\nlet me do as I like. Say Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, nestling softly up to her\r\nfather, and pressing her lips with a fond gentleness to his ear, as she\r\nwhispered the next words. \xe2\x80\x9cSay Yes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good girl for the\r\nrest of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good girl?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca mad girl, I think you must\r\nmean. Hang these people and their theatricals! I shall have to go\r\nindoors and see about this matter. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t throw away your cigar,\r\nFrank. You\xe2\x80\x99re well out of the business, and you can stop here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in the business, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Francis Clare had hitherto remained modestly in the background. He\r\nnow came forward with a face expressive of speechless amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Magdalen, answering his blank look of inquiry with\r\nperfect composure. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to act. Miss Marrable and I have a turn for\r\nbusiness, and we settled it all in five minutes. There are two parts in\r\nthe play left to be filled. One is Lucy, the waiting-maid; which is the\r\ncharacter I have undertaken\xe2\x80\x94with papa\xe2\x80\x99s permission,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, slyly\r\npinching her father\xe2\x80\x99s arm; \xe2\x80\x9cand he won\xe2\x80\x99t say No, will he? First,\r\nbecause he\xe2\x80\x99s a darling; secondly, because I love him, and he loves me;\r\nthirdly, because there is never any difference of opinion between us\r\n(is there?); fourthly, because I give him a kiss, which naturally stops\r\nhis mouth and settles the whole question. Dear me, I\xe2\x80\x99m wandering. Where\r\nwas I just now? Oh yes! explaining myself to Frank\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d began Frank, attempting, at this point, to enter\r\nhis protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second character in the play,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Magdalen, without taking\r\nthe smallest notice of the protest, \xe2\x80\x9cis Falkland\xe2\x80\x94a jealous lover, with\r\na fine flow of language. Miss Marrable and I discussed Falkland\r\nprivately on the window-seat while the rest were talking. She is a\r\ndelightful girl\xe2\x80\x94so impulsive, so sensible, so entirely unaffected. She\r\nconfided in me. She said: \xe2\x80\x98One of our miseries is that we can\xe2\x80\x99t find a\r\ngentleman who will grapple with the hideous difficulties of Falkland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nOf course I soothed her. Of course I said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the gentleman, and\r\nhe shall grapple immediately.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh heavens! who is he?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Francis\r\nClare.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98And where is he?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98In the house at this moment.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Will you be\r\nso very charming, Miss Vanstone, as to fetch him?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch him,\r\nMiss Marrable, with the greatest pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99 I left the window-seat\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nrushed into the morning-room\xe2\x80\x94I smelled cigars\xe2\x80\x94I followed the smell\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhere I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a compliment, I know, to be asked to act,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank, in great\r\nembarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope you and Miss Marrable will excuse me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. Miss Marrable and I are both remarkable for the\r\nfirmness of our characters. When we say Mr. So-and-So is positively to\r\nact the part of Falkland, we positively mean it. Come in and be\r\nintroduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never tried to act. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot of the slightest consequence. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how, come to me\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, papa, be serious! I have the strongest internal conviction that\r\nI could act every character in the play\xe2\x80\x94Falkland included. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\nhave to speak a second time, Frank. Come and be introduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took her father\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and moved on with him to the door of the\r\ngreenhouse. At the steps, she turned and looked round to see if Frank\r\nwas following her. It was only the action of a moment; but in that\r\nmoment her natural firmness of will rallied all its\r\nresources\xe2\x80\x94strengthened itself with the influence of her beauty\r\n\xe2\x80\x94commanded\xe2\x80\x94and conquered. She looked lovely: the flush was tenderly\r\nbright in her cheeks; the radiant pleasure shone and sparkled in her\r\neyes; the position of her figure, turned suddenly from the waist\r\nupward, disclosed its delicate strength, its supple firmness, its\r\nseductive, serpentine grace. \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a coquettish\r\nbeckoning action of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFew men of forty would have resisted her at that moment. Frank was\r\ntwenty last birthday. In other words, he threw aside his cigar, and\r\nfollowed her out of the greenhouse.\r\n\r\nAs he turned and closed the door\xe2\x80\x94in the instant when he lost sight of\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94his disinclination to be associated with the private theatricals\r\nrevived. At the foot of the house-steps he stopped again; plucked a\r\ntwig from a plant near him; broke it in his hand; and looked about him\r\nuneasily, on this side and on that. The path to the left led back to\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s cottage\xe2\x80\x94the way of escape lay open. Why not take it?\r\n\r\nWhile he still hesitated, Mr. Vanstone and his daughter reached the top\r\nof the steps. Once more, Magdalen looked round\xe2\x80\x94looked with her\r\nresistless beauty, with her all-conquering smile. She beckoned again;\r\nand again he followed her\xe2\x80\x94up the steps, and over the threshold. The\r\ndoor closed on them.\r\n\r\nSo, with a trifling gesture of invitation on one side, with a trifling\r\nact of compliance on the other: so\xe2\x80\x94with no knowledge in his mind, with\r\nno thought in hers, of the secret still hidden under the journey to\r\nLondon\xe2\x80\x94they took the way which led to that secret\xe2\x80\x99s discovery, through\r\nmany a darker winding that was yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries into the proposed theatrical entertainment at\r\nEvergreen Lodge were answered by a narrative of dramatic disasters; of\r\nwhich Miss Marrable impersonated the innocent cause, and in which her\r\nfather and mother played the parts of chief victims.\r\n\r\nMiss Marrable was that hardest of all born tyrants\xe2\x80\x94an only child. She\r\nhad never granted a constitutional privilege to her oppressed father\r\nand mother since the time when she cut her first tooth. Her seventeenth\r\nbirthday was now near at hand; she had decided on celebrating it by\r\nacting a play; had issued her orders accordingly; and had been obeyed\r\nby her docile parents as implicitly as usual. Mrs. Marrable gave up the\r\ndrawing-room to be laid waste for a stage and a theater. Mr. Marrable\r\nsecured the services of a respectable professional person to drill the\r\nyoung ladies and gentlemen, and to accept all the other\r\nresponsibilities incidental to creating a dramatic world out of a\r\ndomestic chaos. Having further accustomed themselves to the breaking of\r\nfurniture and the staining of walls\xe2\x80\x94to thumping, tumbling, hammering,\r\nand screaming; to doors always banging, and to footsteps perpetually\r\nrunning up and down stairs\xe2\x80\x94the nominal master and mistress of the house\r\nfondly believed that their chief troubles were over. Innocent and fatal\r\ndelusion! It is one thing in private society to set up the stage and\r\nchoose the play\xe2\x80\x94it is another thing altogether to find the actors.\r\nHitherto, only the small preliminary annoyances proper to the occasion\r\nhad shown themselves at Evergreen Lodge. The sound and serious troubles\r\nwere all to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Rivals\xe2\x80\x9d having been chosen as the play, Miss Marrable, as a matter\r\nof course, appropriated to herself the part of \xe2\x80\x9cLydia Languish.\xe2\x80\x9d One of\r\nher favored swains next secured \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Absolute,\xe2\x80\x9d and another laid\r\nviolent hands on \xe2\x80\x9cSir Lucius O\xe2\x80\x99Trigger.\xe2\x80\x9d These two were followed by an\r\naccommodating spinster relative, who accepted the heavy dramatic\r\nresponsibility of \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Malaprop\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and there the theatrical proceedings\r\ncame to a pause. Nine more speaking characters were left to be fitted\r\nwith representatives; and with that unavoidable necessity the serious\r\ntroubles began.\r\n\r\nAll the friends of the family suddenly became unreliable people, for\r\nthe first time in their lives. After encouraging the idea of the play,\r\nthey declined the personal sacrifice of acting in it\xe2\x80\x94or, they accepted\r\ncharacters, and then broke down in the effort to study them\xe2\x80\x94or they\r\nvolunteered to take the parts which they knew were already engaged, and\r\ndeclined the parts which were waiting to be acted\xe2\x80\x94or they were\r\nafflicted with weak constitutions, and mischievously fell ill when they\r\nwere wanted at rehearsal\xe2\x80\x94or they had Puritan relatives in the\r\nbackground, and, after slipping into their parts cheerfully at the\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s beginning, oozed out of them penitently, under serious family\r\npressure, at the week\xe2\x80\x99s end. Meanwhile, the carpenters hammered and the\r\nscenes rose. Miss Marrable, whose temperament was sensitive, became\r\nhysterical under the strain of perpetual anxiety; the family doctor\r\ndeclined to answer for the nervous consequences if something was not\r\ndone. Renewed efforts were made in every direction. Actors and\r\nactresses were sought with a desperate disregard of all considerations\r\nof personal fitness. Necessity, which knows no law, either in the drama\r\nor out of it, accepted a lad of eighteen as the representative of \xe2\x80\x9cSir\r\nAnthony Absolute\xe2\x80\x9d; the stage-manager undertaking to supply the\r\nnecessary wrinkles from the illimitable resources of theatrical art. A\r\nlady whose age was unknown, and whose personal appearance was stout\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwhose heart was in the right place\xe2\x80\x94volunteered to act the part of the\r\nsentimental \xe2\x80\x9cJulia,\xe2\x80\x9d and brought with her the dramatic qualification of\r\nhabitually wearing a wig in private life. Thanks to these vigorous\r\nmeasures, the play was at last supplied with representatives\xe2\x80\x94always\r\nexcepting the two unmanageable characters of \xe2\x80\x9cLucy\xe2\x80\x9d the waiting-maid,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cFalkland,\xe2\x80\x9d Julia\xe2\x80\x99s jealous lover. Gentlemen came; saw Julia at\r\nrehearsal; observed her stoutness and her wig; omitted to notice that\r\nher heart was in the right place; quailed at the prospect, apologized,\r\nand retired. Ladies read the part of \xe2\x80\x9cLucy\xe2\x80\x9d; remarked that she appeared\r\nto great advantage in the first half of the play, and faded out of it\r\naltogether in the latter half; objected to pass from the notice of the\r\naudience in that manner, when all the rest had a chance of\r\ndistinguishing themselves to the end; shut up the book, apologized, and\r\nretired. In eight days more the night of performance would arrive; a\r\nphalanx of social martyrs two hundred strong had been convened to\r\nwitness it; three full rehearsals were absolutely necessary; and two\r\ncharacters in the play were not filled yet. With this lamentable story,\r\nand with the humblest apologies for presuming on a slight acquaintance,\r\nthe Marrables appeared at Combe-Raven, to appeal to the young ladies\r\nfor a \xe2\x80\x9cLucy,\xe2\x80\x9d and to the universe for a \xe2\x80\x9cFalkland,\xe2\x80\x9d with the mendicant\r\npertinacity of a family in despair.\r\n\r\nThis statement of circumstances\xe2\x80\x94addressed to an audience which included\r\na father of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, and a daughter of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemperament\xe2\x80\x94produced the result which might have been anticipated from\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nEither misinterpreting, or disregarding, the ominous silence preserved\r\nby his wife and Miss Garth, Mr. Vanstone not only gave Magdalen\r\npermission to assist the forlorn dramatic company, but accepted an\r\ninvitation to witness the performance for Norah and himself. Mrs.\r\nVanstone declined accompanying them on account of her health; and Miss\r\nGarth only engaged to make one among the audience conditionally on not\r\nbeing wanted at home. The \xe2\x80\x9cparts\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cLucy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFalkland\xe2\x80\x9d (which the\r\ndistressed family carried about with them everywhere, like incidental\r\nmaladies) were handed to their representatives on the spot. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaint remonstrances were rejected without a hearing; the days and hours\r\nof rehearsal were carefully noted down on the covers of the parts; and\r\nthe Marrables took their leave, with a perfect explosion of\r\nthanks\xe2\x80\x94father, mother, and daughter sowing their expressions of\r\ngratitude broadcast, from the drawing-room door to the garden-gates.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the carriage had driven away, Magdalen presented herself to\r\nthe general observation under an entirely new aspect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf any more visitors call to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with the profoundest\r\ngravity of look and manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at home. This is a far more\r\nserious matter than any of you suppose. Go somewhere by yourself,\r\nFrank, and read over your part, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let your attention wander if\r\nyou can possibly help it. I shall not be accessible before the evening.\r\nIf you will come here\xe2\x80\x94with papa\xe2\x80\x99s permission\xe2\x80\x94after tea, my views on the\r\nsubject of Falkland will be at your disposal. Thomas! whatever else the\r\ngardener does, he is not to make any floricultural noises under my\r\nwindow. For the rest of the afternoon I shall be immersed in study\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe quieter the house is, the more obliged I shall feel to everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s battery of reproof could open fire, before the\r\nfirst outburst of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s hearty laughter could escape his lips,\r\nshe bowed to them with imperturbable gravity; ascended the house-steps,\r\nfor the first time in her life, at a walk instead of a run, and retired\r\nthen and there to the bedroom regions. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s helpless astonishment at\r\nher disappearance added a new element of absurdity to the scene. He\r\nstood first on one leg and then on the other; rolling and unrolling his\r\npart, and looking piteously in the faces of the friends about him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in after tea, and hear\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s views? Thank you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll look in about eight. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell my\r\nfather about this acting, please; I should never hear the last of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThose were the only words he had spirit enough to utter. He drifted\r\naway aimlessly in the direction of the shrubbery, with the part hanging\r\nopen in his hand\xe2\x80\x94the most incapable of Falklands, and the most helpless\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nFrank\xe2\x80\x99s departure left the family by themselves, and was the signal\r\naccordingly for an attack on Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s inveterate carelessness in\r\nthe exercise of his paternal authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could you possibly be thinking of, Andrew, when you gave your\r\nconsent?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely my silence was a sufficient\r\nwarning to you to say No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mistake, Mr. Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cMade with the best\r\nintentions\xe2\x80\x94but a mistake for all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah, taking her father\xe2\x80\x99s part, as usual.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see how papa, or any one else, could have declined,\r\nunder the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cThe circumstances, as\r\nyou say, were dead against me. Here were these unfortunate people in a\r\nscrape on one side; and Magdalen, on the other, mad to act. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay I had methodistical objections\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing methodistical about me.\r\nWhat other excuse could I make? The Marrables are respectable people,\r\nand keep the best company in Clifton. What harm can she get in their\r\nhouse? If you come to prudence and that sort of thing\xe2\x80\x94why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nMagdalen do what Miss Marrable does? There! there! let the poor things\r\nact, and amuse themselves. We were their age once\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\nmaking a fuss\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that characteristic defense of his own conduct, Mr. Vanstone\r\nsauntered back to the greenhouse to smoke another cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so to papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah, taking her mother\xe2\x80\x99s arm on the\r\nway back to the house, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the bad result of the acting, in my\r\nopinion, will be the familiarity it is sure to encourage between\r\nMagdalen and Francis Clare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are prejudiced against Frank, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanstone.\r\n\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s soft, secret, hazel eyes sank to the ground; she said no more.\r\nHer opinions were unchangeable\xe2\x80\x94but she never disputed with anybody. She\r\nhad the great failing of a reserved nature\xe2\x80\x94the failing of obstinacy;\r\nand the great merit\xe2\x80\x94the merit of silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your head running on\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Miss Garth, casting a sharp look at Norah\xe2\x80\x99s dark,\r\ndowncast face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re one of the impenetrable sort. Give me Magdalen,\r\nwith all her perversities; I can see daylight through her. You\xe2\x80\x99re as\r\ndark as night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hours of the afternoon passed away, and still Magdalen remained\r\nshut up in her own room. No restless footsteps pattered on the stairs;\r\nno nimble tongue was heard chattering here, there, and everywhere, from\r\nthe garret to the kitchen\xe2\x80\x94the house seemed hardly like itself, with the\r\none ever-disturbing element in the family serenity suddenly withdrawn\r\nfrom it. Anxious to witness with her own eyes the reality of a\r\ntransformation in which past experience still inclined her to\r\ndisbelieve, Miss Garth ascended to Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s room, knocked twice at\r\nthe door, received no answer, opened it and looked in.\r\n\r\nThere sat Magdalen, in an arm-chair before the long looking-glass, with\r\nall her hair let down over her shoulders; absorbed in the study of her\r\npart and comfortably arrayed in her morning wrapper, until it was time\r\nto dress for dinner. And there behind her sat the lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid, slowly\r\ncombing out the long heavy locks of her young mistress\xe2\x80\x99s hair, with the\r\nsleepy resignation of a woman who had been engaged in that employment\r\nfor some hours past. The sun was shining; and the green shutters\r\noutside the window were closed. The dim light fell tenderly on the two\r\nquiet seated figures; on the little white bed, with the knots of\r\nrose-colored ribbon which looped up its curtains, and the bright dress\r\nfor dinner laid ready across it; on the gayly painted bath, with its\r\npure lining of white enamel; on the toilet-table with its sparkling\r\ntrinkets, its crystal bottles, its silver bell with Cupid for a handle,\r\nits litter of little luxuries that adorn the shrine of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed-chamber. The luxurious tranquillity of the scene; the cool\r\nfragrance of flowers and perfumes in the atmosphere; the rapt attitude\r\nof Magdalen, absorbed over her reading; the monotonous regularity of\r\nmovement in the maid\xe2\x80\x99s hand and arm, as she drew the comb smoothly\r\nthrough and through her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s hair\xe2\x80\x94all conveyed the same soothing\r\nimpression of drowsy, delicious quiet. On one side of the door were the\r\nbroad daylight and the familiar realities of life. On the other was the\r\ndream-land of Elysian serenity\xe2\x80\x94the sanctuary of unruffled repose.\r\n\r\nMiss Garth paused on the threshold, and looked into the room in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s curious fancy for having her hair combed at all times and\r\nseasons was among the peculiarities of her character which were\r\nnotorious to everybody in the house. It was one of her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavorite jokes that she reminded him, on such occasions, of a cat\r\nhaving her back stroked, and that he always expected, if the combing\r\nwere only continued long enough, to hear her _purr_. Extravagant as it\r\nmay seem, the comparison was not altogether inappropriate. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfervid temperament intensified the essentially feminine pleasure that\r\nmost women feel in the passage of the comb through their hair, to a\r\nluxury of sensation which absorbed her in enjoyment, so serenely\r\nself-demonstrative, so drowsily deep that it did irresistibly suggest a\r\npet cat\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment under a caressing hand. Intimately as Miss Garth\r\nwas acquainted with this peculiarity in her pupil, she now saw it\r\nasserting itself for the first time, in association with mental\r\nexertion of any kind on Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s part. Feeling, therefore, some\r\ncuriosity to know how long the combing and the studying had gone on\r\ntogether, she ventured on putting the question, first to the mistress;\r\nand (receiving no answer in that quarter) secondly to the maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the afternoon, miss, off and on,\xe2\x80\x9d was the weary answer. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nMagdalen says it soothes her feelings and clears her mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKnowing by experience that interference would be hopeless, under these\r\ncircumstances, Miss Garth turned sharply and left the room. She smiled\r\nwhen she was outside on the landing. The female mind does\r\noccasionally\xe2\x80\x94though not often\xe2\x80\x94project itself into the future. Miss\r\nGarth was prophetically pitying Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate husband.\r\n\r\nDinner-time presented the fair student to the family eye in the same\r\nmentally absorbed aspect. On all ordinary occasions Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s appetite\r\nwould have terrified those feeble sentimentalists who affect to ignore\r\nthe all-important influence which female feeding exerts in the\r\nproduction of female beauty. On this occasion she refused one dish\r\nafter another with a resolution which implied the rarest of all modern\r\nmartyrdoms\xe2\x80\x94gastric martyrdom. \xe2\x80\x9cI have conceived the part of Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nobserved, with the demurest gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next difficulty is to make\r\nFrank conceive the part of Falkland. I see nothing to laugh at\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwould all be serious enough if you had my responsibilities. No, papa\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nwine to-day, thank you. I must keep my intelligence clear. Water,\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x94and a little more jelly, I think, before you take it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Frank presented himself in the evening, ignorant of the first\r\nelements of his part, she took him in hand, as a middle-aged\r\nschoolmistress might have taken in hand a backward little boy. The few\r\nattempts he made to vary the sternly practical nature of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noccupation by slipping in compliments sidelong she put away from her\r\nwith the contemptuous self-possession of a woman of twice her age. She\r\nliterally forced him into his part. Her father fell asleep in his\r\nchair. Mrs. Vanstone and Miss Garth lost their interest in the\r\nproceedings, retired to the further end of the room, and spoke together\r\nin whispers. It grew later and later; and still Magdalen never flinched\r\nfrom her task\xe2\x80\x94still, with equal perseverance, Norah, who had been on\r\nthe watch all through the evening, kept on the watch to the end. The\r\ndistrust darkened and darkened on her face as she looked at her sister\r\nand Frank; as she saw how close they sat together, devoted to the same\r\ninterest and working to the same end. The clock on the mantel-piece\r\npointed to half-past eleven before Lucy the resolute permitted Falkland\r\nthe helpless to shut up his task-book for the night. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s wonderfully\r\nclever, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank, taking leave of Mr. Vanstone at the\r\nhall door. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m to come to-morrow, and hear more of her views\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\nhave no objection. I shall never do it; don\xe2\x80\x99t tell her I said so. As\r\nfast as she teaches me one speech, the other goes out of my head.\r\nDiscouraging, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Goodnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day but one was the day of the first full rehearsal. On the\r\nprevious evening Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s spirits had been sadly depressed. At a\r\nprivate interview with Miss Garth she had referred again, of her own\r\naccord, to the subject of her letter from London\xe2\x80\x94had spoken\r\nself-reproachfully of her weakness in admitting Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpudent claim to a family connection with her\xe2\x80\x94and had then reverted to\r\nthe state of her health and to the doubtful prospect that awaited her\r\nin the coming summer in a tone of despondency which it was very\r\ndistressing to hear. Anxious to cheer her spirits, Miss Garth had\r\nchanged the conversation as soon as possible\xe2\x80\x94had referred to the\r\napproaching theatrical performance\xe2\x80\x94and had relieved Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind of all anxiety in that direction, by announcing her intention of\r\naccompanying Magdalen to each rehearsal, and of not losing sight of her\r\nuntil she was safely back again in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house. Accordingly,\r\nwhen Frank presented himself at Combe-Raven on the eventful morning,\r\nthere stood Miss Garth, prepared\xe2\x80\x94in the interpolated character of\r\nArgus\xe2\x80\x94to accompany Lucy and Falkland to the scene of trial. The railway\r\nconveyed the three, in excellent time, to Evergreen Lodge; and at one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the rehearsal began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Miss Vanstone knows her part?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mrs. Marrable,\r\nanxiously addressing herself to Miss Garth, in a corner of the theater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf airs and graces make an actress, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s performance will\r\nastonish us all.\xe2\x80\x9d With that reply, Miss Garth took out her work, and\r\nseated herself, on guard, in the center of the pit.\r\n\r\nThe manager perched himself, book in hand, on a stool close in front of\r\nthe stage. He was an active little man, of a sweet and cheerful temper;\r\nand he gave the signal to begin with as patient an interest in the\r\nproceedings as if they had caused him no trouble in the past and\r\npromised him no difficulty in the future. The two characters which\r\nopened the comedy of The Rivals, \xe2\x80\x9cFag\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Coachman,\xe2\x80\x9d appeared on\r\nthe scene\xe2\x80\x94looked many sizes too tall for their canvas background, which\r\nrepresented a \xe2\x80\x9cStreet in Bath\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94exhibited the customary inability to\r\nmanage their own arms, legs, and voices\xe2\x80\x94went out severally at the wrong\r\nexits\xe2\x80\x94and expressed their perfect approval of results, so far, by\r\nlaughing heartily behind the scenes. \xe2\x80\x9cSilence, gentlemen, if you\r\nplease,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the cheerful manager. \xe2\x80\x9cAs loud as you like _on_\r\nthe stage, but the audience mustn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you _off_ it. Miss Marrable\r\nready? Miss Vanstone ready? Easy there with the \xe2\x80\x98Street in Bath\xe2\x80\x99; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing up crooked! Face this way, Miss Marrable; full face, if you\r\nplease. Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he checked himself suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cCurious,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, under his breath\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe fronts the audience of her own accord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLucy opened the scene in these words: \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I traversed half\r\nthe town in search of it: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a circulating library\r\nin Bath I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been at.\xe2\x80\x9d The manager started in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cMy heart\r\nalive! she speaks out without telling!\xe2\x80\x9d The dialogue went on. Lucy\r\nproduced the novels for Miss Lydia Languish\xe2\x80\x99s private reading from\r\nunder her cloak. The manager rose excitably to his feet. Marvelous! No\r\nhurry with the books; no dropping them. She looked at the titles before\r\nshe announced them to her mistress; she set down \xe2\x80\x9cHumphrey Clinker\xe2\x80\x9d on\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Tears of Sensibility\xe2\x80\x9d with a smart little smack which pointed the\r\nantithesis. One moment\xe2\x80\x94and she announced Julia\xe2\x80\x99s visit; another\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\ndropped the brisk waiting-maid\xe2\x80\x99s courtesy; a third\xe2\x80\x94and she was off the\r\nstage on the side set down for her in the book. The manager wheeled\r\nround on his stool, and looked hard at Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Marrable told me, before we began, that this was\r\nthe young lady\xe2\x80\x99s first attempt. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be, surely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Garth, reflecting the manager\xe2\x80\x99s look of amazement\r\non her own face. Was it possible that Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s unintelligible\r\nindustry in the study of her part really sprang from a serious interest\r\nin her occupation\xe2\x80\x94an interest which implied a natural fitness for it?\r\n\r\nThe rehearsal went on. The stout lady with the wig (and the excellent\r\nheart) personated the sentimental Julia from an inveterately tragic\r\npoint of view, and used her handkerchief distractedly in the first\r\nscene. The spinster relative felt Mrs. Malaprop\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes in language\r\nso seriously, and took such extraordinary pains with her blunders, that\r\nthey sounded more like exercises in elocution than anything else. The\r\nunhappy lad who led the forlorn hope of the company, in the person of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Anthony Absolute,\xe2\x80\x9d expressed the age and irascibility of his\r\ncharacter by tottering incessantly at the knees, and thumping the stage\r\nperpetually with his stick. Slowly and clumsily, with constant\r\ninterruptions and interminable mistakes, the first act dragged on,\r\nuntil Lucy appeared again to end it in soliloquy, with the confession\r\nof her assumed simplicity and the praise of her own cunning.\r\n\r\nHere the stage artifice of the situation presented difficulties which\r\nMagdalen had not encountered in the first scene\xe2\x80\x94and here, her total\r\nwant of experience led her into more than one palpable mistake. The\r\nstage-manager, with an eagerness which he had not shown in the case of\r\nany other member of the company, interfered immediately, and set her\r\nright. At one point she was to pause, and take a turn on the stage\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ndid it. At another, she was to stop, toss her head, and look pertly at\r\nthe audience\xe2\x80\x94she did it. When she took out the paper to read the list\r\nof the presents she had received, could she give it a tap with her\r\nfinger (Yes)? And lead off with a little laugh (Yes\xe2\x80\x94after twice\r\ntrying)? Could she read the different items with a sly look at the end\r\nof each sentence, straight at the pit (Yes, straight at the pit, and as\r\nsly as you please)? The manager\xe2\x80\x99s cheerful face beamed with approval.\r\nHe tucked the play under his arm, and clapped his hands gayly; the\r\ngentlemen, clustered together behind the scenes, followed his example;\r\nthe ladies looked at each other with dawning doubts whether they had\r\nnot better have left the new recruit in the retirement of private life.\r\nToo deeply absorbed in the business of the stage to heed any of them,\r\nMagdalen asked leave to repeat the soliloquy, and make quite sure of\r\nher own improvement. She went all through it again without a mistake,\r\nthis time, from beginning to end; the manager celebrating her attention\r\nto his directions by an outburst of professional approbation, which\r\nescaped him in spite of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can take a hint!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nlittle man, with a hearty smack of his hand on the prompt-book. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na born actress, if ever there was one yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth to herself, taking up the work which had\r\ndropped into her lap, and looking down at it in some perplexity. Her\r\nworst apprehension of results in connection with the theatrical\r\nenterprise had foreboded levity of conduct with some of the\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x94she had not bargained for this. Magdalen, in the capacity of\r\na thoughtless girl, was comparatively easy to deal with. Magdalen, in\r\nthe character of a born actress, threatened serious future\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe rehearsal proceeded. Lucy returned to the stage for her scenes in\r\nthe second act (the last in which she appears) with Sir Lucius and Fag.\r\nHere, again, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s inexperience betrayed itself\xe2\x80\x94and here once more\r\nher resolution in attacking and conquering her own mistakes astonished\r\neverybody. \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentlemen behind the scenes, as she\r\nsteadily trampled down one blunder after another. \xe2\x80\x9cRidiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe ladies, \xe2\x80\x9cwith such a small part as hers.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought Miss. Garth, coming round unwillingly to the general opinion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost wish we were Papists, and I had a convent to put her in\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d One of Mr. Marrable\xe2\x80\x99s servants entered the theater as that\r\ndesperate aspiration escaped the governess. She instantly sent the man\r\nbehind the scene with a message: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vanstone has done her part in\r\nthe rehearsal; request her to come here and sit by me.\xe2\x80\x9d The servant\r\nreturned with a polite apology: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s kind love, and she\r\nbegs to be excused\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s prompting Mr. Clare.\xe2\x80\x9d She prompted him to such\r\npurpose that he actually got through his part. The performances of the\r\nother gentlemen were obtrusively imbecile. Frank was just one degree\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x94he was modestly incapable; and he gained by comparison. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks\r\nto Miss Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the manager, who had heard the prompting.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe pulled him through. We shall be flat enough at night, when the\r\ndrop falls on the second act, and the audience have seen the last of\r\nher. It\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand pities she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a better part!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand mercies she\xe2\x80\x99s no more to do than she has,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered\r\nMiss Garth, overhearing him. \xe2\x80\x9cAs things are, the people can\xe2\x80\x99t well turn\r\nher head with applause. She\xe2\x80\x99s out of the play in the second act\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none comfort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo well-regulated mind ever draws its inferences in a hurry; Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s mind was well regulated; therefore, logically speaking, Miss\r\nGarth ought to have been superior to the weakness of rushing at\r\nconclusions. She had committed that error, nevertheless, under present\r\ncircumstances. In plainer terms, the consoling reflection which had\r\njust occurred to her assumed that the play had by this time survived\r\nall its disasters, and entered on its long-deferred career of success.\r\nThe play had done nothing of the sort. Misfortune and the Marrable\r\nfamily had not parted company yet.\r\n\r\nWhen the rehearsal was over, nobody observed that the stout lady with\r\nthe wig privately withdrew herself from the company; and when she was\r\nafterward missed from the table of refreshments, which Mr. Marrable\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhospitality kept ready spread in a room near the theater, nobody\r\nimagined that there was any serious reason for her absence. It was not\r\ntill the ladies and gentlemen assembled for the next rehearsal that the\r\ntrue state of the case was impressed on the minds of the company. At\r\nthe appointed hour no Julia appeared. In her stead, Mrs. Marrable\r\nportentously approached the stage, with an open letter in her hand. She\r\nwas naturally a lady of the mildest good breeding: she was mistress of\r\nevery bland conventionality in the English language\xe2\x80\x94but disasters and\r\ndramatic influences combined, threw even this harmless matron off her\r\nbalance at last. For the first time in her life Mrs. Marrable indulged\r\nin vehement gesture, and used strong language. She handed the letter\r\nsternly, at arms-length, to her daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with an\r\naspect of awful composure, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are under a Curse.\xe2\x80\x9d Before the amazed\r\ndramatic company could petition for an explanation, she turned and left\r\nthe room. The manager\xe2\x80\x99s professional eye followed her out\r\nrespectfully\xe2\x80\x94he looked as if he approved of the exit, from a theatrical\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nWhat new misfortune had befallen the play? The last and worst of all\r\nmisfortunes had assailed it. The stout lady had resigned her part.\r\n\r\nNot maliciously. Her heart, which had been in the right place\r\nthroughout, remained inflexibly in the right place still. Her\r\nexplanation of the circumstances proved this, if nothing else did. The\r\nletter began with a statement: She had overheard, at the last rehearsal\r\n(quite unintentionally), personal remarks of which she was the subject.\r\nThey might, or might not, have had reference to her\xe2\x80\x94Hair; and\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94Figure. She would not distress Mrs. Marrable by repeating them.\r\nNeither would she mention names, because it was foreign to her nature\r\nto make bad worse. The only course at all consistent with her own\r\nself-respect was to resign her part. She inclosed it, accordingly, to\r\nMrs. Marrable, with many apologies for her presumption in undertaking a\r\nyouthful character, at\xe2\x80\x94what a gentleman was pleased to term\xe2\x80\x94her Age;\r\nand with what two ladies were rude enough to characterize as her\r\ndisadvantages of\xe2\x80\x94Hair, and\xe2\x80\x94Figure. A younger and more attractive\r\nrepresentative of Julia would no doubt be easily found. In the\r\nmeantime, all persons concerned had her full forgiveness, to which she\r\nwould only beg leave to add her best and kindest wishes for the success\r\nof the play.\r\n\r\nIn four nights more the play was to be performed. If ever any human\r\nenterprise stood in need of good wishes to help it, that enterprise was\r\nunquestionably the theatrical entertainment at Evergreen Lodge!\r\n\r\nOne arm-chair was allowed on the stage; and into that arm-chair Miss\r\nMarrable sank, preparatory to a fit of hysterics. Magdalen stepped\r\nforward at the first convulsion; snatched the letter from Miss\r\nMarrable\xe2\x80\x99s hand; and stopped the threatened catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s an ugly, bald-headed, malicious, middle-aged wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMagdalen, tearing the letter into fragments, and tossing them over the\r\nheads of the company. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can tell her one thing\xe2\x80\x94she shan\xe2\x80\x99t spoil\r\nthe play. I\xe2\x80\x99ll act Julia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the chorus of gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94the anonymous gentleman who had\r\nhelped to do the mischief (otherwise Mr. Francis Clare) loudest of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want the truth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t shrink from owning it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nMagdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m one of the ladies she means. I said she had a head like\r\na mop, and a waist like a bolster. So she has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the other lady,\xe2\x80\x9d added the spinster relative. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I only said\r\nshe was too stout for the part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in Frank, stimulated by the force of\r\nexample. \xe2\x80\x9cI said nothing\xe2\x80\x94I only agreed with the ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Miss Garth seized her opportunity, and addressed the stage loudly\r\nfrom the pit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! Stop!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t settle the difficulty that way. If\r\nMagdalen plays Julia, who is to play Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Marrable sank back in the arm-chair, and gave way to the second\r\nconvulsion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing\xe2\x80\x99s simple enough, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nact Julia and Lucy both together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manager was consulted on the spot. Suppressing Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nentrance, and turning the short dialogue about the novels into a\r\nsoliloquy for Lydia Languish, appeared to be the only changes of\r\nimportance necessary to the accomplishment of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s project.\r\nLucy\xe2\x80\x99s two telling scenes, at the end of the first and second acts,\r\nwere sufficiently removed from the scenes in which Julia appeared to\r\ngive time for the necessary transformations in dress. Even Miss Garth,\r\nthough she tried hard to find them, could put no fresh obstacles in the\r\nway. The question was settled in five minutes, and the rehearsal went\r\non; Magdalen learning Julia\xe2\x80\x99s stage situations with the book in her\r\nhand, and announcing afterward, on the journey home, that she proposed\r\nsitting up all night to study the new part. Frank thereupon expressed\r\nhis fears that she would have no time left to help him through his\r\ntheatrical difficulties. She tapped him on the shoulder coquettishly\r\nwith her part. \xe2\x80\x9cYou foolish fellow, how am I to do without you? You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nJulia\xe2\x80\x99s jealous lover; you\xe2\x80\x99re always making Julia cry. Come to-night,\r\nand make me cry at tea-time. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a venomous old woman in a\r\nwig to act with now. It\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ heart you\xe2\x80\x99re to break\xe2\x80\x94and of course I\r\nshall teach you how to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four days\xe2\x80\x99 interval passed busily in perpetual rehearsals, public\r\nand private. The night of performance arrived; the guests assembled;\r\nthe great dramatic experiment stood on its trial. Magdalen had made the\r\nmost of her opportunities; she had learned all that the manager could\r\nteach her in the time. Miss Garth left her when the overture began,\r\nsitting apart in a corner behind the scenes, serious and silent, with\r\nher smelling-bottle in one hand, and her book in the other, resolutely\r\ntraining herself for the coming ordeal, to the very last.\r\n\r\nThe play began, with all the proper accompaniments of a theatrical\r\nperformance in private life; with a crowded audience, an African\r\ntemperature, a bursting of heated lamp-glasses, and a difficulty in\r\ndrawing up the curtain. \xe2\x80\x9cFag\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe Coachman,\xe2\x80\x9d who opened the scene,\r\ntook leave of their memories as soon as they stepped on the stage; left\r\nhalf their dialogue unspoken; came to a dead pause; were audibly\r\nentreated by the invisible manager to \xe2\x80\x9ccome off\xe2\x80\x9d; and went off\r\naccordingly, in every respect sadder and wiser men than when they went\r\non. The next scene disclosed Miss Marrable as \xe2\x80\x9cLydia Languish,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ngracefully seated, very pretty, beautifully dressed, accurately\r\nmistress of the smallest words in her part; possessed, in short, of\r\nevery personal resource\xe2\x80\x94except her voice. The ladies admired, the\r\ngentlemen applauded. Nobody heard anything but the words \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak up,\r\nmiss,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered by the same voice which had already entreated \xe2\x80\x9cFag\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cthe Coachman\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccome off.\xe2\x80\x9d A responsive titter rose among the\r\nyounger spectators; checked immediately by magnanimous applause. The\r\ntemperature of the audience was rising to Blood Heat\xe2\x80\x94but the national\r\nsense of fair play was not boiled out of them yet.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the demonstration, Magdalen quietly made her first\r\nentrance, as \xe2\x80\x9cJulia.\xe2\x80\x9d She was dressed very plainly in dark colors, and\r\nwore her own hair; all stage adjuncts and alterations (excepting the\r\nslightest possible touch of rouge on her cheeks) having been kept in\r\nreserve to disguise her the more effectually in her second part. The\r\ngrace and simplicity of her costume, the steady self-possession with\r\nwhich she looked out over the eager rows of faces before her, raised a\r\nlow hum of approval and expectation. She spoke\xe2\x80\x94after suppressing a\r\nmomentary tremor\xe2\x80\x94with a quiet distinctness of utterance which reached\r\nall ears, and which at once confirmed the favorable impression that her\r\nappearance had produced. The one member of the audience who looked at\r\nher and listened to her coldly, was her elder sister. Before the\r\nactress of the evening had been five minutes on the stage, Norah\r\ndetected, to her own indescribable astonishment, that Magdalen had\r\naudaciously individualized the feeble amiability of \xe2\x80\x9cJulia\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncharacter, by seizing no less a person than herself as the model to act\r\nit by. She saw all her own little formal peculiarities of manner and\r\nmovement unblushingly reproduced\xe2\x80\x94and even the very tone of her voice so\r\naccurately mimicked from time to time, that the accents startled her as\r\nif she was speaking herself, with an echo on the stage. The effect of\r\nthis cool appropriation of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s identity to theatrical purposes on\r\nthe audience\xe2\x80\x94who only saw results\xe2\x80\x94asserted itself in a storm of\r\napplause on Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s exit. She had won two incontestable triumphs in\r\nher first scene. By a dexterous piece of mimicry, she had made a living\r\nreality of one of the most insipid characters in the English drama; and\r\nshe had roused to enthusiasm an audience of two hundred exiles from the\r\nblessings of ventilation, all simmering together in their own animal\r\nheat. Under the circumstances, where is the actress by profession who\r\ncould have done much more?\r\n\r\nBut the event of the evening was still to come. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s disguised\r\nre-appearance at the end of the act, in the character of \xe2\x80\x9cLucy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nfalse hair and false eyebrows, with a bright-red complexion and patches\r\non her cheeks, with the gayest colors flaunting in her dress, and the\r\nshrillest vivacity of voice and manner\xe2\x80\x94fairly staggered the audience.\r\nThey looked down at their programmes, in which the representative of\r\nLucy figured under an assumed name; looked up again at the stage;\r\npenetrated the disguise; and vented their astonishment in another round\r\nof applause, louder and heartier even than the last. Norah herself\r\ncould not deny this time that the tribute of approbation had been well\r\ndeserved. There, forcing its way steadily through all the faults of\r\ninexperience\xe2\x80\x94there, plainly visible to the dullest of the spectators,\r\nwas the rare faculty of dramatic impersonation, expressing itself in\r\nevery look and action of this girl of eighteen, who now stood on a\r\nstage for the first time in her life. Failing in many minor requisites\r\nof the double task which she had undertaken, she succeeded in the one\r\nimportant necessity of keeping the main distinctions of the two\r\ncharacters thoroughly apart. Everybody felt that the difficulty lay\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94everybody saw the difficulty conquered\xe2\x80\x94everybody echoed the\r\nmanager\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm at rehearsal, which had hailed her as a born\r\nactress.\r\n\r\nWhen the drop-scene descended for the first time, Magdalen had\r\nconcentrated in herself the whole interest and attraction of the play.\r\nThe audience politely applauded Miss Marrable, as became the guests\r\nassembled in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house: and good-humoredly encouraged the\r\nremainder of the company, to help them through a task for which they\r\nwere all, more or less, palpably unfit. But, as the play proceeded,\r\nnothing roused them to any genuine expression of interest when Magdalen\r\nwas absent from the scene. There was no disguising it: Miss Marrable\r\nand her bosom friends had been all hopelessly cast in the shade by the\r\nnew recruit whom they had summoned to assist them, in the capacity of\r\nforlorn hope. And this on Miss Marrable\xe2\x80\x99s own birthday! and this in her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house! and this after the unutterable sacrifices of six weeks\r\npast! Of all the domestic disasters which the thankless theatrical\r\nenterprise had inflicted on the Marrable family, the crowning\r\nmisfortune was now consummated by Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s success.\r\n\r\nLeaving Mr. Vanstone and Norah, on the conclusion of the play, among\r\nthe guests in the supper-room, Miss Garth went behind the scenes;\r\nostensibly anxious to see if she could be of any use; really bent on\r\nascertaining whether Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s head had been turned by the triumphs of\r\nthe evening. It would not have surprised Miss Garth if she had\r\ndiscovered her pupil in the act of making terms with the manager for\r\nher forthcoming appearance in a public theater. As events really turned\r\nout, she found Magdalen on the stage, receiving, with gracious smiles,\r\na card which the manager presented to her with a professional bow.\r\nNoticing Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s mute look of inquiry, the civil little man\r\nhastened to explain that the card was his own, and that he was merely\r\nasking the favor of Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation at any future\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the last time the young lady will be concerned in private\r\ntheatricals, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if a\r\nsuperintendent is wanted on the next occasion, she has kindly promised\r\nto say a good word for me. I am always to be heard of, miss, at that\r\naddress.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying those words, he bowed again, and discreetly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nVague suspicions beset the mind of Miss Garth, and urged her to insist\r\non looking at the card. No more harmless morsel of pasteboard was ever\r\npassed from one hand to another. The card contained nothing but the\r\nmanager\xe2\x80\x99s name, and, under it, the name and address of a theatrical\r\nagent in London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worth the trouble of keeping,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth.\r\n\r\nMagdalen caught her hand before she could throw the card away\xe2\x80\x94possessed\r\nherself of it the next instant\xe2\x80\x94and put it in her pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised to recommend him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s one reason for\r\nkeeping his card. If it does nothing else, it will remind me of the\r\nhappiest evening of my life\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s another. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried,\r\nthrowing her arms round Miss Garth with a feverish gayety\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccongratulate\r\nme on my success!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will congratulate you when you have got over it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour more Magdalen had changed her dress; had joined the\r\nguests; and had soared into an atmosphere of congratulation high above\r\nthe reach of any controlling influence that Miss Garth could exercise.\r\nFrank, dilatory in all his proceedings, was the last of the dramatic\r\ncompany who left the precincts of the stage. He made no attempt to join\r\nMagdalen in the supper-room\xe2\x80\x94but he was ready in the hall with her cloak\r\nwhen the carriages were called and the party broke up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking round at him as he put the cloak on her\r\nshoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so sorry it\xe2\x80\x99s all over! Come to-morrow morning, and\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it by ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the shrubbery at ten?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Frank, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nShe drew up the hood of her cloak and nodded to him gayly. Miss Garth,\r\nstanding near, noticed the looks that passed between them, though the\r\ndisturbance made by the parting guests prevented her from hearing the\r\nwords. There was a soft, underlying tenderness in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s assumed\r\ngayety of manner\xe2\x80\x94there was a sudden thoughtfulness in her face, a\r\nconfidential readiness in her hand, as she took Frank\xe2\x80\x99s arm and went\r\nout to the carriage. What did it mean? Had her passing interest in him\r\nas her stage-pupil treacherously sown the seeds of any deeper interest\r\nin him, as a man? Had the idle theatrical scheme, now that it was all\r\nover, graver results to answer for than a mischievous waste of time?\r\n\r\nThe lines on Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s face deepened and hardened: she stood lost\r\namong the fluttering crowd around her. Norah\xe2\x80\x99s warning words, addressed\r\nto Mrs. Vanstone in the garden, recurred to her memory\xe2\x80\x94and now, for the\r\nfirst time, the idea dawned on her that Norah had seen the consequences\r\nin their true light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Miss Garth and Norah met in the garden and spoke\r\ntogether privately. The only noticeable result of the interview, when\r\nthey presented themselves at the breakfast-table, appeared in the\r\nmarked silence which they both maintained on the topic of the\r\ntheatrical performance. Mrs. Vanstone was entirely indebted to her\r\nhusband and to her youngest daughter for all that she heard of the\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment. The governess and the elder daughter had\r\nevidently determined on letting the subject drop.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast was over Magdalen proved to be missing, when the ladies\r\nassembled as usual in the morning-room. Her habits were so little\r\nregular that Mrs. Vanstone felt neither surprise nor uneasiness at her\r\nabsence. Miss Garth and Norah looked at one another significantly, and\r\nwaited in silence. Two hours passed\xe2\x80\x94and there were no signs of\r\nMagdalen. Norah rose, as the clock struck twelve, and quietly left the\r\nroom to look for her.\r\n\r\nShe was not upstairs dusting her jewelry and disarranging her dresses.\r\nShe was not in the conservatory, not in the flower-garden; not in the\r\nkitchen teasing the cook; not in the yard playing with the dogs. Had\r\nshe, by any chance, gone out with her father? Mr. Vanstone had\r\nannounced his intention, at the breakfast-table, of paying a morning\r\nvisit to his old ally, Mr. Clare, and of rousing the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsarcastic indignation by an account of the dramatic performance. None\r\nof the other ladies at Combe-Raven ever ventured themselves inside the\r\ncottage. But Magdalen was reckless enough for anything\xe2\x80\x94and Magdalen\r\nmight have gone there. As the idea occurred to her, Norah entered the\r\nshrubbery.\r\n\r\nAt the second turning, where the path among the trees wound away out of\r\nsight of the house, she came suddenly face to face with Magdalen and\r\nFrank: they were sauntering toward her, arm in arm, their heads close\r\ntogether, their conversation apparently proceeding in whispers. They\r\nlooked suspiciously handsome and happy. At the sight of Norah both\r\nstarted, and both stopped. Frank confusedly raised his hat, and turned\r\nback in the direction of his father\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. Magdalen advanced to\r\nmeet her sister, carelessly swinging her closed parasol from side to\r\nside, carelessly humming an air from the overture which had preceded\r\nthe rising of the curtain on the previous night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuncheon-time already!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at her watch. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you and Mr. Francis Clare been alone in the shrubbery since ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Norah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mr._ Francis Clare! How ridiculously formal you are. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ncall him Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked you a question, Magdalen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, how black you look this morning! I\xe2\x80\x99m in disgrace, I suppose.\r\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you forgiven me yet for my acting last night? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit, love; I should have made nothing of Julia, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken you\r\nfor my model. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a question of Art. In your place, I should\r\nhave felt flattered by the selection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn _your_ place, Magdalen, I should have thought twice before I\r\nmimicked my sister to an audience of strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why I did it\xe2\x80\x94an audience of strangers. How were they to\r\nknow? Come! come! don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry. You are eight years older than I\r\nam\xe2\x80\x94you ought to set me an example of good-humor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will set you an example of plain-speaking. I am more sorry than I\r\ncan say, Magdalen, to meet you as I met you here just now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next, I wonder? You meet me in the shrubbery at home, talking\r\nover the private theatricals with my old playfellow, whom I knew when I\r\nwas no taller than this parasol. And that is a glaring impropriety, is\r\nit? \xe2\x80\x98Honi soit qui mal y pense.\xe2\x80\x99 You wanted an answer a minute\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94there it is for you, my dear, in the choicest Norman-French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in earnest about this, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a doubt of it. Nobody can accuse you of ever making jokes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am seriously sorry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite useless to interrupt me. I have it on my conscience to\r\ntell you\xe2\x80\x94and I _will_ tell you\xe2\x80\x94that I am sorry to see how this intimacy\r\nis growing. I am sorry to see a secret understanding established\r\nalready between you and Mr. Francis Clare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Frank! How you do hate him, to be sure. What on earth has he done\r\nto offend you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s self-control began to show signs of failing her. Her dark\r\ncheeks glowed, her delicate lips trembled, before she spoke again.\r\nMagdalen paid more attention to her parasol than to her sister. She\r\ntossed it high in the air and caught it. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce!\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94and tossed it\r\nup again. \xe2\x80\x9cTwice!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she tossed it higher. \xe2\x80\x9cThrice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Before she could\r\ncatch it for the third time, Norah seized her passionately by the arm,\r\nand the parasol dropped to the ground between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are treating me heartlessly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nshame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe irrepressible outburst of a reserved nature, forced into open\r\nself-assertion in its own despite, is of all moral forces the hardest\r\nto resist. Magdalen was startled into silence. For a moment, the two\r\nsisters\xe2\x80\x94so strangely dissimilar in person and character\xe2\x80\x94faced one\r\nanother, without a word passing between them. For a moment the deep\r\nbrown eyes of the elder and the light gray eyes of the younger looked\r\ninto each other with steady, unyielding scrutiny on either side.\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s face was the first to change; Norah\xe2\x80\x99s head was the first to\r\nturn away. She dropped her sister\xe2\x80\x99s arm in silence. Magdalen stooped\r\nand picked up her parasol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI try to keep my temper,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you call me heartless for\r\ndoing it. You always were hard on me, and you always will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah clasped her trembling hands fast in each other. \xe2\x80\x9cHard on you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, in low, mournful tones\xe2\x80\x94and sighed bitterly.\r\n\r\nMagdalen drew back a little, and mechanically dusted the parasol with\r\nthe end of her garden cloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cHard on me and hard on Frank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrank!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Norah, advancing on her sister and turning pale as\r\nsuddenly as she had turned red. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you talk of yourself and Frank as\r\nif your interests were One already? Magdalen! if I hurt _you_, do I\r\nhurt _him_? Is he so near and so dear to you as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen drew further and further back. A twig from a tree near caught\r\nher cloak; she turned petulantly, broke it off, and threw it on the\r\nground. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have you to question me?\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out on a\r\nsudden. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether I like Frank, or whether I don\xe2\x80\x99t, what interest is it\r\nof yours?\xe2\x80\x9d As she said the words, she abruptly stepped forward to pass\r\nher sister and return to the house.\r\n\r\nNorah, turning paler and paler, barred the way to her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I hold you\r\nby main force,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall stop and hear me. I have watched\r\nthis Francis Clare; I know him better than you do. He is unworthy of a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s serious feeling on your part; he is unworthy of our dear,\r\ngood, kind-hearted father\xe2\x80\x99s interest in him. A man with any principle,\r\nany honor, any gratitude, would not have come back as he has come back,\r\ndisgraced\xe2\x80\x94yes! disgraced by his spiritless neglect of his own duty. I\r\nwatched his face while the friend who has been better than a father to\r\nhim was comforting and forgiving him with a kindness he had not\r\ndeserved: I watched his face, and I saw no shame and no distress in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94I saw nothing but a look of thankless, heartless relief. He is\r\nselfish, he is ungrateful, he is ungenerous\xe2\x80\x94he is only twenty, and he\r\nhas the worst failings of a mean old age already. And this is the man I\r\nfind you meeting in secret\xe2\x80\x94the man who has taken such a place in your\r\nfavor that you are deaf to the truth about him, even from _my_ lips!\r\nMagdalen! this will end ill. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, think of what I have said\r\nto you, and control yourself before it is too late!\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped,\r\nvehement and breathless, and caught her sister anxiously by the hand.\r\n\r\nMagdalen looked at her in unconcealed astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so violent,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand so unlike yourself, that I hardly\r\nknow you. The more patient I am, the more hard words I get for my\r\npains. You have taken a perverse hatred to Frank; and you are\r\nunreasonably angry with me because I won\xe2\x80\x99t hate him, too. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, Norah!\r\nyou hurt my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah pushed the hand from her contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never hurt your\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and suddenly turned her back on Magdalen as she spoke\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause. Norah kept her position. Magdalen looked\r\nat her perplexedly\xe2\x80\x94hesitated\xe2\x80\x94then walked away by herself toward the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAt the turn in the shrubbery path she stopped and looked back uneasily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t Frank go when I\r\ntold him?\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated, and went back a few steps. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Norah\r\nstanding on her dignity, as obstinate as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat had I better do? I hate quarreling: I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll make up.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nventured close to her sister and touched her on the shoulder. Norah\r\nnever moved. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not often she flies into a passion,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nMagdalen, touching her again; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when she does, what a time it lasts\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x94Come!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me a kiss, Norah, and make it up. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nlet me get at any part of you, my dear, but the back of your neck?\r\nWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice neck\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s better worth kissing than mine\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthere the kiss is, in spite of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe caught fast hold of Norah from behind, and suited the action to the\r\nword, with a total disregard of all that had just passed, which her\r\nsister was far from emulating. Hardly a minute since the warm\r\noutpouring of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s heart had burst through all obstacles. Had the\r\nicy reserve frozen her up again already! It was hard to say. She never\r\nspoke; she never changed her position\xe2\x80\x94she only searched hurriedly for\r\nher handkerchief. As she drew it out, there was a sound of approaching\r\nfootsteps in the inner recesses of the shrubbery. A Scotch terrier\r\nscampered into view; and a cheerful voice sang the first lines of the\r\nglee in \xe2\x80\x9cAs You Like It.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s papa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x94come and meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of following her sister, Norah pulled down the veil of her\r\ngarden hat, turned in the opposite direction, and hurried back to the\r\nhouse. She ran up to her own room and locked herself in. She was crying\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWhen Magdalen and her father met in the shrubbery Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nshowed plainly that something had happened to please him since he had\r\nleft home in the morning. He answered the question which his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncuriosity at once addressed to him by informing her that he had just\r\ncome from Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s cottage; and that he had picked up, in that\r\nunpromising locality, a startling piece of news for the family at\r\nCombe-Raven.\r\n\r\nOn entering the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s study that morning, Mr. Vanstone had\r\nfound him still dawdling over his late breakfast, with an open letter\r\nby his side, in place of the book which, on other occasions, lay ready\r\nto his hand at meal-times. He held up the letter the moment his visitor\r\ncame into the room, and abruptly opened the conversation by asking Mr.\r\nVanstone if his nerves were in good order, and if he felt himself\r\nstrong enough for the shock of an overwhelming surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNerves!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God, I know nothing about my\r\nnerves. If you have got anything to tell me, shock or no shock, out\r\nwith it on the spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clare held the letter a little higher, and frowned at his visitor\r\nacross the breakfast-table. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I always told you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nwith his sourest solemnity of look and manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal more than I could ever keep in my head,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr.\r\nVanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your presence and out of it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Clare, \xe2\x80\x9cI have always\r\nmaintained that the one important phenomenon presented by modern\r\nsociety is\xe2\x80\x94the enormous prosperity of Fools. Show me an individual\r\nFool, and I will show you an aggregate Society which gives that\r\nhighly-favored personage nine chances out of ten\xe2\x80\x94and grudges the tenth\r\nto the wisest man in existence. Look where you will, in every high\r\nplace there sits an Ass, settled beyond the reach of all the greatest\r\nintellects in this world to pull him down. Over our whole social\r\nsystem, complacent Imbecility rules supreme\xe2\x80\x94snuffs out the searching\r\nlight of Intelligence with total impunity\xe2\x80\x94and hoots, owl-like, in\r\nanswer to every form of protest, See how well we all do in the dark!\r\nOne of these days that audacious assertion will be practically\r\ncontradicted, and the whole rotten system of modern society will come\r\ndown with a crash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Vanstone, looking about him as if the crash was\r\ncoming already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a crash!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is my theory, in few words.\r\nNow for the remarkable application of it which this letter suggests.\r\nHere is my lout of a boy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that Frank has got another chance?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr.\r\nVanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is this perfectly hopeless booby, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the\r\nphilosopher. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has never done anything in his life to help himself,\r\nand, as a necessary consequence, Society is in a conspiracy to carry\r\nhim to the top of the tree. He has hardly had time to throw away that\r\nchance you gave him before this letter comes, and puts the ball at his\r\nfoot for the second time. My rich cousin (who is intellectually fit to\r\nbe at the tail of the family, and who is, therefore, as a matter of\r\ncourse, at the head of it) has been good enough to remember my\r\nexistence; and has offered his influence to serve my eldest boy. Read\r\nhis letter, and then observe the sequence of events. My rich cousin is\r\na booby who thrives on landed property; he has done something for\r\nanother booby who thrives on Politics, who knows a third booby who\r\nthrives on Commerce, who can do something for a fourth booby, thriving\r\nat present on nothing, whose name is Frank. So the mill goes. So the\r\ncream of all human rewards is sipped in endless succession by the\r\nFools. I shall pack Frank off to-morrow. In course of time he\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nback again on our hands, like a bad shilling; more chances will fall in\r\nhis way, as a necessary consequence of his meritorious imbecility.\r\nYears will go on\xe2\x80\x94I may not live to see it, no more may you\xe2\x80\x94it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter; Frank\xe2\x80\x99s future is equally certain either way\xe2\x80\x94put him into the\r\narmy, the Church, politics, what you please, and let him drift: he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nend in being a general, a bishop, or a minister of State, by dint of\r\nthe great modern qualification of doing nothing whatever to deserve his\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d With this summary of his son\xe2\x80\x99s worldly prospects, Mr. Clare\r\ntossed the letter contemptuously across the table and poured himself\r\nout another cup of tea.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanstone read the letter with eager interest and pleasure. It was\r\nwritten in a tone of somewhat elaborate cordiality; but the practical\r\nadvantages which it placed at Frank\xe2\x80\x99s disposal were beyond all doubt.\r\nThe writer had the means of using a friend\xe2\x80\x99s interest\xe2\x80\x94interest of no\r\nordinary kind\xe2\x80\x94with a great Mercantile Firm in the City; and he had at\r\nonce exerted this influence in favor of Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s eldest boy. Frank\r\nwould be received in the office on a very different footing from the\r\nfooting of an ordinary clerk; he would be \xe2\x80\x9cpushed on\xe2\x80\x9d at every\r\navailable opportunity; and the first \xe2\x80\x9cgood thing\xe2\x80\x9d the House had to\r\noffer, either at home or abroad, would be placed at his disposal. If he\r\npossessed fair abilities and showed common diligence in exercising\r\nthem, his fortune was made; and the sooner he was sent to London to\r\nbegin the better for his own interests it would be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful news!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Vanstone, returning the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndelighted\xe2\x80\x94I must go back and tell them at home. This is fifty times the\r\nchance that mine was. What the deuce do you mean by abusing Society?\r\nSociety has behaved uncommonly well, in my opinion. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLurking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is one of the intolerable peculiarities\r\nof louts that they always lurk. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen _my_ lout this morning.\r\nIt you meet with him anywhere, give him a kick, and say I want him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of his son\xe2\x80\x99s habits might have been expressed more\r\npolitely as to form; but, as to substance, it happened, on that\r\nparticular morning, to be perfectly correct. After leaving Magdalen,\r\nFrank had waited in the shrubbery, at a safe distance, on the chance\r\nthat she might detach herself from her sister\xe2\x80\x99s company, and join him\r\nagain. Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s appearance immediately on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s departure,\r\ninstead of encouraging him to show himself, had determined him on\r\nreturning to the cottage. He walked back discontentedly; and so fell\r\ninto his father\xe2\x80\x99s clutches, totally unprepared for the pending\r\nannouncement, in that formidable quarter, of his departure for London.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mr. Vanstone had communicated his news\xe2\x80\x94in the first\r\nplace, to Magdalen, and afterward, on getting back to the house, to his\r\nwife and Miss Garth. He was too unobservant a man to notice that\r\nMagdalen looked unaccountably startled, and Miss Garth unaccountably\r\nrelieved, by his announcement of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune. He talked on\r\nabout it, quite unsuspiciously, until the luncheon-bell rang\xe2\x80\x94and then,\r\nfor the first time, he noticed Norah\xe2\x80\x99s absence. She sent a message\r\ndownstairs, after they had assembled at the table, to say that a\r\nheadache was keeping her in her own room. When Miss Garth went up\r\nshortly afterward to communicate the news about Frank, Norah appeared,\r\nstrangely enough, to feel very little relieved by hearing it. Mr.\r\nFrancis Clare had gone away on a former occasion (she remarked), and\r\nhad come back. He might come back again, and sooner than they any of\r\nthem thought for. She said no more on the subject than this: she made\r\nno reference to what had taken place in the shrubbery. Her\r\nunconquerable reserve seemed to have strengthened its hold on her since\r\nthe outburst of the morning. She met Magdalen, later in the day, as if\r\nnothing had happened: no formal reconciliation took place between them.\r\nIt was one of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s peculiarities to shrink from all reconciliations\r\nthat were openly ratified, and to take her shy refuge in\r\nreconciliations that were silently implied. Magdalen saw plainly, in\r\nher look and manner, that she had made her first and last protest.\r\nWhether the motive was pride, or sullenness, or distrust of herself, or\r\ndespair of doing good, the result was not to be mistaken\xe2\x80\x94Norah had\r\nresolved on remaining passive for the future.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon, Mr. Vanstone suggested a drive to his eldest\r\ndaughter, as the best remedy for her headache. She readily consented to\r\naccompany her father; who thereupon proposed, as usual, that Magdalen\r\nshould join them. Magdalen was nowhere to be found. For the second time\r\nthat day she had wandered into the grounds by herself. On this\r\noccasion, Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x94who, after adopting Norah\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, had passed\r\nfrom the one extreme of over-looking Frank altogether, to the other\r\nextreme of believing him capable of planning an elopement at five\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 notice\xe2\x80\x94volunteered to set forth immediately, and do her best\r\nto find the missing young lady. After a prolonged absence, she returned\r\nunsuccessful\xe2\x80\x94with the strongest persuasion in her own mind that\r\nMagdalen and Frank had secretly met one another somewhere, but without\r\nhaving discovered the smallest fragment of evidence to confirm her\r\nsuspicions. By this time the carriage was at the door, and Mr. Vanstone\r\nwas unwilling to wait any longer. He and Norah drove away together; and\r\nMrs. Vanstone and Miss Garth sat at home over their work.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour more, Magdalen composedly walked into the room. She was\r\npale and depressed. She received Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrances with a\r\nweary inattention; explained carelessly that she had been wandering in\r\nthe wood; took up some books, and put them down again; sighed\r\nimpatiently, and went away upstairs to her own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Magdalen is feeling the reaction, after yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nVanstone, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is just as we thought. Now the theatrical\r\namusements are all over, she is fretting for more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity of letting in the light of truth on Mrs.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s mind, which was too favorable to be missed. Miss Garth\r\nquestioned her conscience, saw her chance, and took it on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a certain neighbor of ours is going\r\naway to-morrow. Shall I tell you the truth? Magdalen is fretting over\r\nthe departure of Francis Clare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanstone looked up from her work with a gentle, smiling surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely not?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is natural enough that Frank should be\r\nattracted by Magdalen; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t think that Magdalen returns the\r\nfeeling. Frank is so very unlike her; so quiet and undemonstrative; so\r\ndull and helpless, poor fellow, in some things. He is handsome, I know,\r\nbut he is so singularly unlike Magdalen, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t think it\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear good lady!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Garth, in great amazement; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you\r\nreally suppose that people fall in love with each other on account of\r\nsimilarities in their characters? In the vast majority of cases, they\r\ndo just the reverse. Men marry the very last women, and women the very\r\nlast men, whom their friends would think it possible they could care\r\nabout. Is there any phrase that is oftener on all our lips than \xe2\x80\x98What\r\ncan have made Mr. So-and-So marry that woman?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x98How could Mrs.\r\nSo-and-So throw herself away on that man?\xe2\x80\x99 Has all your experience of\r\nthe world never yet shown you that girls take perverse fancies for men\r\nwho are totally unworthy of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanstone, composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot that. Still it\r\nseems unaccountable, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnaccountable, because it happens every day!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Miss Garth,\r\ngood-humoredly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know a great many excellent people who reason\r\nagainst plain experience in the same way\xe2\x80\x94who read the newspapers in the\r\nmorning, and deny in the evening that there is any romance for writers\r\nor painters to work upon in modern life. Seriously, Mrs. Vanstone, you\r\nmay take my word for it\xe2\x80\x94thanks to those wretched theatricals, Magdalen\r\nis going the way with Frank that a great many young ladies have gone\r\nbefore her. He is quite unworthy of her; he is, in almost every\r\nrespect, her exact opposite\xe2\x80\x94and, without knowing it herself, she has\r\nfallen in love with him on that very account. She is resolute and\r\nimpetuous, clever and domineering; she is not one of those model women\r\nwho want a man to look up to, and to protect them\xe2\x80\x94her beau-ideal\r\n(though she may not think it herself) is a man she can henpeck. Well!\r\none comfort is, there are far better men, even of that sort, to be had\r\nthan Frank. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy he is going away, before we have more trouble\r\nwith them, and before any serious mischief is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanstone, smiling compassionately. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\nknown him since he was in jackets, and Magdalen in short frocks. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet us give him up yet. He may do better this second time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth looked up in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd suppose he does better?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanstone cut off a loose thread in her work, and laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is an old farmyard proverb which\r\nwarns us not to count our chickens before they are hatched. Let us wait\r\na little before we count ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to silence Miss Garth, when she was speaking under the\r\ninfluence of a strong conviction; but this reply closed her lips. She\r\nresumed her work, and looked, and thought, unutterable things.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s behavior was certainly remarkable under the\r\ncircumstances. Here, on one side, was a girl\xe2\x80\x94with great personal\r\nattractions, with rare pecuniary prospects, with a social position\r\nwhich might have justified the best gentleman in the neighborhood in\r\nmaking her an offer of marriage\xe2\x80\x94perversely casting herself away on a\r\npenniless idle young fellow, who had failed at his first start in life,\r\nand who even if he succeeded in his second attempt, must be for years\r\nto come in no position to marry a young lady of fortune on equal terms.\r\nAnd there, on the other side, was that girl\xe2\x80\x99s mother, by no means\r\ndismayed at the prospect of a connection which was, to say the least of\r\nit, far from desirable; by no means certain, judging her by her own\r\nwords and looks, that a marriage between Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughter and\r\nMr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s son might not prove to be as satisfactory a result of the\r\nintimacy between the two young people as the parents on both sides\r\ncould possibly wish for! It was perplexing in the extreme. It was\r\nalmost as unintelligible as that past mystery\xe2\x80\x94that forgotten mystery\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94of the journey to London.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Frank made his appearance, and announced that his\r\nfather had mercilessly sentenced him to leave Combe-Raven by the\r\nparliamentary train the next morning. He mentioned this circumstance\r\nwith an air of sentimental resignation; and listened to Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboisterous rejoicings over his new prospects with a mild and mute\r\nsurprise. His gentle melancholy of look and manner greatly assisted his\r\npersonal advantages. In his own effeminate way he was more handsome\r\nthan ever that evening. His soft brown eyes wandered about the room\r\nwith a melting tenderness; his hair was beautifully brushed; his\r\ndelicate hands hung over the arms of his chair with a languid grace. He\r\nlooked like a convalescent Apollo. Never, on any previous occasion, had\r\nhe practiced more successfully the social art which he habitually\r\ncultivated\xe2\x80\x94the art of casting himself on society in the character of a\r\nwell-bred Incubus, and conferring an obligation on his fellow-creatures\r\nby allowing them to sit under him. It was undeniably a dull evening.\r\nAll the talking fell to the share of Mr. Vanstone and Miss Garth. Mrs.\r\nVanstone was habitually silent; Norah kept herself obstinately in the\r\nbackground; Magdalen was quiet and undemonstrative beyond all former\r\nprecedent. From first to last, she kept rigidly on her guard. The few\r\nmeaning looks that she cast on Frank flashed at him like lightning, and\r\nwere gone before any one else could see them. Even when she brought him\r\nhis tea; and when, in doing so, her self-control gave way under the\r\ntemptation which no woman can resist\xe2\x80\x94the temptation of touching the man\r\nshe loves\xe2\x80\x94even then, she held the saucer so dexterously that it\r\nscreened her hand. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s self-possession was far less steadily\r\ndisciplined: it only lasted as long as he remained passive. When he\r\nrose to go; when he felt the warm, clinging pressure of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfingers round his hand, and the lock of her hair which she slipped into\r\nit at the same moment, he became awkward and confused. He might have\r\nbetrayed Magdalen and betrayed himself, but for Mr. Vanstone, who\r\ninnocently covered his retreat by following him out, and patting him on\r\nthe shoulder all the way. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the friendly\r\nvoice that never had a harsh note in it for anybody. \xe2\x80\x9cYour fortune\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaiting for you. Go in, my boy\xe2\x80\x94go in and win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you. It will be rather difficult to go in and\r\nwin, at first. Of course, as you have always told me, a man\xe2\x80\x99s business\r\nis to conquer his difficulties, and not to talk about them. At the same\r\ntime, I wish I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite so loose as I do in my figures. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscouraging to feel loose in one\xe2\x80\x99s figures.\xe2\x80\x94Oh, yes; I\xe2\x80\x99ll write and\r\ntell you how I get on. I\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged by your kindness, and very\r\nsorry I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed with the engineering. I think I should have\r\nliked engineering better than trade. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped now, can it?\r\nThank you, again. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he drifted away into the misty commercial future\xe2\x80\x94as aimless, as\r\nhelpless, as gentleman-like as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThree months passed. During that time Frank remained in London;\r\npursuing his new duties, and writing occasionally to report himself to\r\nMr. Vanstone, as he had promised.\r\n\r\nHis letters were not enthusiastic on the subject of mercantile\r\noccupations. He described himself as being still painfully loose in his\r\nfigures. He was also more firmly persuaded than ever\xe2\x80\x94now when it was\r\nunfortunately too late\xe2\x80\x94that he preferred engineering to trade. In spite\r\nof this conviction; in spite of headaches caused by sitting on a high\r\nstool and stooping over ledgers in unwholesome air; in spite of want of\r\nsociety, and hasty breakfasts, and bad dinners at chop-houses, his\r\nattendance at the office was regular, and his diligence at the desk\r\nunremitting. The head of the department in which he was working might\r\nbe referred to if any corroboration of this statement was desired. Such\r\nwas the general tenor of the letters; and Frank\xe2\x80\x99s correspondent and\r\nFrank\xe2\x80\x99s father differed over them as widely as usual. Mr. Vanstone\r\naccepted them as proofs of the steady development of industrious\r\nprinciples in the writer. Mr. Clare took his own characteristically\r\nopposite view. \xe2\x80\x9cThese London men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the philosopher, \xe2\x80\x9care not to be\r\ntrifled with by louts. They have got Frank by the scruff of the neck\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t wriggle himself free\xe2\x80\x94and he makes a merit of yielding to sheer\r\nnecessity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three months\xe2\x80\x99 interval of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s probation in London passed less\r\ncheerfully than usual in the household at Combe-Raven.\r\n\r\nAs the summer came nearer and nearer, Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s spirits, in spite\r\nof her resolute efforts to control them, became more and more\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do my best,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Miss Garth; \xe2\x80\x9cI set an example of\r\ncheerfulness to my husband and my children\xe2\x80\x94but I dread July.\xe2\x80\x9d Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsecret misgivings on her sister\xe2\x80\x99s account rendered her more than\r\nusually serious and uncommunicative, as the year advanced. Even Mr.\r\nVanstone, when July drew nearer, lost something of his elasticity of\r\nspirit. He kept up appearances in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s presence\xe2\x80\x94but on all other\r\noccasions there was now a perceptible shade of sadness in his look and\r\nmanner. Magdalen was so changed since Frank\xe2\x80\x99s departure that she helped\r\nthe general depression, instead of relieving it. All her movements had\r\ngrown languid; all her usual occupations were pursued with the same\r\nweary indifference; she spent hours alone in her own room; she lost her\r\ninterest in being brightly and prettily dressed; her eyes were heavy,\r\nher nerves were irritable, her complexion was altered visibly for the\r\nworse\xe2\x80\x94in one word, she had become an oppression and a weariness to\r\nherself and to all about her. Stoutly as Miss Garth contended with\r\nthese growing domestic difficulties, her own spirits suffered in the\r\neffort. Her memory reverted, oftener and oftener, to the March morning\r\nwhen the master and mistress of the house had departed for London, and\r\nthen the first serious change, for many a year past, had stolen over\r\nthe family atmosphere. When was that atmosphere to be clear again? When\r\nwere the clouds of change to pass off before the returning sunshine of\r\npast and happier times?\r\n\r\nThe spring and the early summer wore away. The dreaded month of July\r\ncame, with its airless nights, its cloudless mornings, and its sultry\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of the month, an event happened which took every one\r\nbut Norah by surprise. For the second time, without the slightest\r\napparent reason\xe2\x80\x94for the second time, without a word of warning\r\nbeforehand\xe2\x80\x94Frank suddenly re-appeared at his father\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\n\r\nMr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s lips opened to hail his son\xe2\x80\x99s return, in the old character\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cbad shilling\xe2\x80\x9d; and closed again without uttering a word. There\r\nwas a portentous composure in Frank\xe2\x80\x99s manner which showed that he had\r\nother news to communicate than the news of his dismissal. He answered\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s sardonic look of inquiry by at once explaining that a very\r\nimportant proposal for his future benefit had been made to him, that\r\nmorning, at the office. His first idea had been to communicate the\r\ndetails in writing; but the partners had, on reflection, thought that\r\nthe necessary decision might be more readily obtained by a personal\r\ninterview with his father and his friends. He had laid aside the pen\r\naccordingly, and had resigned himself to the railway on the spot.\r\n\r\nAfter this preliminary statement, Frank proceeded to describe the\r\nproposal which his employers had addressed to him, with every external\r\nappearance of viewing it in the light of an intolerable hardship.\r\n\r\nThe great firm in the City had obviously made a discovery in relation\r\nto their clerk, exactly similar to the discovery which had formerly\r\nforced itself on the engineer in relation to his pupil. The young man,\r\nas they politely phrased it, stood in need of some special stimulant to\r\nstir him up. His employers (acting under a sense of their obligation to\r\nthe gentleman by whom Frank had been recommended) had considered the\r\nquestion carefully, and had decided that the one promising use to which\r\nthey could put Mr. Francis Clare was to send him forthwith into another\r\nquarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this decision, it was now, therefore, proposed that\r\nhe should enter the house of their correspondents in China; that he\r\nshould remain there, familiarizing himself thoroughly on the spot with\r\nthe tea trade and the silk trade for five years; and that he should\r\nreturn, at the expiration of this period, to the central establishment\r\nin London. If he made a fair use of his opportunities in China, he\r\nwould come back, while still a young man, fit for a position of trust\r\nand emolument, and justified in looking forward, at no distant date, to\r\na time when the House would assist him to start in business for\r\nhimself. Such were the new prospects which\xe2\x80\x94to adopt Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheory\xe2\x80\x94now forced themselves on the ever-reluctant, ever-helpless and\r\never-ungrateful Frank. There was no time to be lost. The final answer\r\nwas to be at the office on \xe2\x80\x9cMonday, the twentieth\xe2\x80\x9d: the correspondents\r\nin China were to be written to by the mail on that day; and Frank was\r\nto follow the letter by the next opportunity, or to resign his chance\r\nin favor of some more enterprising young man.\r\n\r\nMr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s reception of this extraordinary news was startling in the\r\nextreme. The glorious prospect of his son\xe2\x80\x99s banishment to China\r\nappeared to turn his brain. The firm pedestal of his philosophy sank\r\nunder him; the prejudices of society recovered their hold on his mind.\r\nHe seized Frank by the arm, and actually accompanied him to\r\nCombe-Raven, in the amazing character of visitor to the house!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am with my lout,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clare, before a word could be\r\nuttered by the astonished family. \xe2\x80\x9cHear his story, all of you. It has\r\nreconciled me, for the first time in my life, to the anomaly of his\r\nexistence.\xe2\x80\x9d Frank ruefully narrated the Chinese proposal for the second\r\ntime, and attempted to attach to it his own supplementary statement of\r\nobjections and difficulties. His father stopped him at the first word,\r\npointed peremptorily southeastward (from Somersetshire to China); and\r\nsaid, without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation: \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vanstone, basking in\r\ngolden visions of his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s future, echoed that monosyllabic\r\ndecision with all his heart. Mrs. Vanstone, Miss Garth, even Norah\r\nherself, spoke to the same purpose. Frank was petrified by an absolute\r\nunanimity of opinion which he had not anticipated; and Magdalen was\r\ncaught, for once in her life, at the end of all her resources.\r\n\r\nSo far as practical results were concerned, the sitting of the family\r\ncouncil began and ended with the general opinion that Frank must go.\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s faculties were so bewildered by the son\xe2\x80\x99s sudden\r\narrival, the father\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected visit, and the news they both brought\r\nwith them, that he petitioned for an adjournment before the necessary\r\narrangements connected with his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s departure were\r\nconsidered in detail. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we all sleep upon it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow our heads will feel a little steadier; and to-morrow will be\r\ntime enough to decide all uncertainties.\xe2\x80\x9d This suggestion was readily\r\nadopted; and all further proceedings stood adjourned until the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThat next day was destined to decide more uncertainties than Mr.\r\nVanstone dreamed of.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, after making tea by herself as usual, Miss Garth\r\ntook her parasol and strolled into the garden. She had slept ill; and\r\nten minutes in the open air before the family assembled at breakfast\r\nmight help to compensate her, as she thought, for the loss of her\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s rest.\r\n\r\nShe wandered to the outermost boundary of the flower-garden, and then\r\nreturned by another path, which led back, past the side of an\r\nornamental summer-house commanding a view over the fields from a corner\r\nof the lawn. A slight noise\xe2\x80\x94like, and yet not like, the chirruping of a\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x94caught her ear as she approached the summer-house. She stepped\r\nround to the entrance; looked in; and discovered Magdalen and Frank\r\nseated close together. To Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s horror, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s arm was\r\nunmistakably round Frank\xe2\x80\x99s neck; and, worse still, the position of her\r\nface, at the moment of discovery, showed beyond all doubt that she had\r\njust been offering to the victim of Chinese commerce the first and\r\nforemost of all the consolations which a woman can bestow on a man. In\r\nplainer words, she had just given Frank a kiss.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of such an emergency as now confronted her, Miss Garth\r\nfelt instinctively that all ordinary phrases of reproof would be\r\nphrases thrown away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, addressing Magdalen with the merciless\r\nself-possession of a middle-aged lady, unprovided for the occasion with\r\nany kissing remembrances of her own\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI presume (whatever excuses your\r\neffrontery may suggest) you will not deny that my duty compels me to\r\nmention what I have just seen to your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will save you the trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nmention it to him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, she looked round at Frank, standing trebly helpless\r\nin a corner of the summer-house. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear what happens,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, with her bright smile. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so shall you,\xe2\x80\x9d she added for Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s especial benefit, as she sauntered past the governess on her\r\nway back to the breakfast-table. The eyes of Miss Garth followed her\r\nindignantly; and Frank slipped out on his side at that favorable\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, there was but one course that any\r\nrespectable woman could take\xe2\x80\x94she could only shudder. Miss Garth\r\nregistered her protest in that form, and returned to the house.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over, and when Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s hand descended to his\r\npocket in search of his cigar-case, Magdalen rose; looked significantly\r\nat Miss Garth; and followed her father into the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you this morning\xe2\x80\x94in private.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalen hesitated, searching for a satisfactory form of\r\nexpression, and found it. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout business, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanstone took his garden hat from the hall table\xe2\x80\x94opened his eyes in\r\nmute perplexity\xe2\x80\x94attempted to associate in his mind the two\r\nextravagantly dissimilar ideas of Magdalen and \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94failed\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nled the way resignedly into the garden.\r\n\r\nHis daughter took his arm, and walked with him to a shady seat at a\r\nconvenient distance from the house. She dusted the seat with her smart\r\nsilk apron before her father occupied it. Mr. Vanstone was not\r\naccustomed to such an extraordinary act of attention as this. He sat\r\ndown, looking more puzzled than ever. Magdalen immediately placed\r\nherself on his knee, and rested her head comfortably on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I heavy, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear, you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut not too heavy for _me_.\r\nStop on your perch, if you like it. Well? And what may this business\r\nhappen to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt begins with a question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, indeed? That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. Business with your sex, my dear,\r\nalways begins with questions. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! do you ever intend allowing me to be married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened wider and wider. The question, to use his\r\nown phrase, completely staggered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is business with a vengeance!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Magdalen! what have\r\nyou got in that harum-scarum head of yours now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know, papa. Will you answer my question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will if I can, my dear; you rather stagger me. Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\nYes; I suppose I must let you be married one of these days\xe2\x80\x94if we can\r\nfind a good husband for you. How hot your face is! Lift it up, and let\r\nthe air blow over it. You won\xe2\x80\x99t? Well\xe2\x80\x94have your own way. If talking of\r\nbusiness means tickling your cheek against my whisker I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to\r\nsay against it. Go on, my dear. What\xe2\x80\x99s the next question? Come to the\r\npoint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was far too genuine a woman to do anything of the sort. She skirted\r\nround the point and calculated her distance to the nicety of a\r\nhair-breadth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were all very much surprised yesterday\xe2\x80\x94were we not, papa? Frank is\r\nwonderfully lucky, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the luckiest dog I ever came across,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanstone \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\r\nhas that got to do with this business of yours? I dare say you see your\r\nway, Magdalen. Hang me if I can see mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe skirted a little nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he will make his fortune in China?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long\r\nway off, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Did you observe, papa, that Frank looked sadly out\r\nof spirits yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so surprised by the news,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanstone, \xe2\x80\x9cand so staggered\r\nby the sight of old Clare\xe2\x80\x99s sharp nose in my house, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nnotice. Now you remind me of it\xe2\x80\x94yes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Frank took kindly to\r\nhis own good luck; not kindly at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wonder at that, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear; I do, rather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be sent away for five years, to make your\r\nfortune among hateful savages, and lose sight of your friends at home\r\nfor all that long time? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think Frank will miss _us_ sadly?\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you, papa?\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, Magdalen! I\xe2\x80\x99m a little too old for those long arms of yours to\r\nthrottle me in fun.\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re right, my love. Nothing in this world\r\nwithout a drawback. Frank _will_ miss his friends in England: there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno denying that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always liked Frank. And Frank always liked you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94a good fellow; a quiet, good fellow. Frank and I have always\r\ngot on smoothly together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have got on like father and son, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you will think it harder on him when he has gone than you\r\nthink it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikely enough, Magdalen; I don\xe2\x80\x99t say no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you will wish he had stopped in England? Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he stop\r\nin England, and do as well as if he went to China?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear! he has no prospects in England. I wish he had, for his own\r\nsake. I wish the lad well, with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I wish him well too, papa\xe2\x80\x94with all _my_ heart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my love\xe2\x80\x94your old playfellow\xe2\x80\x94why not? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? God\r\nbless my soul, what is the girl crying about? One would think Frank was\r\ntransported for life. You goose! You know, as well as I do, he is going\r\nto China to make his fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make his fortune\xe2\x80\x94he might do much better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce he might! How, I should like to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh at me. Will you\r\npromise not to laugh at me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything to please you, my dear. Yes: I promise. Now, then, out with\r\nit! How might Frank do better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might marry Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the summer scene which then spread before Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had\r\nsuddenly changed to a dreary winter view\xe2\x80\x94if the trees had lost all\r\ntheir leaves, and the green fields had turned white with snow in an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x94his face could hardly have expressed greater amazement than it\r\ndisplayed when his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s faltering voice spoke those four last\r\nwords. He tried to look at her\xe2\x80\x94but she steadily refused him the\r\nopportunity: she kept her face hidden over his shoulder. Was she in\r\nearnest? His cheek, still wet with her tears, answered for her. There\r\nwas a long pause of silence; she waited\xe2\x80\x94with unaccustomed patience, she\r\nwaited for him to speak. He roused himself, and spoke these words only:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me, Magdalen; you surprise me more than I can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the altered tone of his voice\xe2\x80\x94altered to a quiet, fatherly\r\nseriousness\xe2\x80\x94Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s arms clung round him closer than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I disappointed you, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say I have\r\ndisappointed you! Who am I to tell my secret to, if not to you? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet him go\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t! don\xe2\x80\x99t! You will break his heart. He is afraid to tell\r\nhis father; he is even afraid _you_ might be angry with him. There is\r\nnobody to speak for us, except\xe2\x80\x94except me. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let him go! Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor his sake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered the next words in a kiss\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t for Mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s kind face saddened; he sighed, and patted her fair head\r\ntenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cHush, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, almost in a whisper; \xe2\x80\x9chush!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlittle knew what a revelation every word, every action that escaped\r\nher, now opened before him. She had made him her grown-up playfellow,\r\nfrom her childhood to that day. She had romped with him in her frocks,\r\nshe had gone on romping with him in her gowns. He had never been long\r\nenough separated from her to have the external changes in his daughter\r\nforced on his attention. His artless, fatherly experience of her had\r\ntaught him that she was a taller child in later years\xe2\x80\x94and had taught\r\nhim little more. And now, in one breathless instant, the conviction\r\nthat she was a woman rushed over his mind. He felt it in the trouble of\r\nher bosom pressed against his; in the nervous thrill of her arms\r\nclasped around his neck. The Magdalen of his innocent experience, a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94with the master-passion of her sex in possession of her heart\r\nalready!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you thought long of this, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as soon as he could\r\nspeak composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered the question before he could finish it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure I love him?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what words can say Yes for me, as I\r\nwant to say it? I love him\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice faltered softly; and her answer\r\nended in a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very young. You and Frank, my love, are both very young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her head from his shoulder for the first time. The thought\r\nand its expression flashed from her at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we much younger than you and mamma were?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, smiling\r\nthrough her tears.\r\n\r\nShe tried to lay her head back in its old position; but as she spoke\r\nthose words, her father caught her round the waist, forced her, before\r\nshe was aware of it, to look him in the face\xe2\x80\x94and kissed her, with a\r\nsudden outburst of tenderness which brought the tears thronging back\r\nthickly into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cNot much younger, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in low,\r\nbroken tones\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot much younger than your mother and I were.\xe2\x80\x9d He put her\r\naway from him, and rose from the seat, and turned his head aside\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWait here, and compose yourself; I will go indoors and speak\r\nto your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice trembled over those parting words; and he\r\nleft her without once looking round again.\r\n\r\nShe waited\xe2\x80\x94waited a weary time; and he never came back. At last her\r\ngrowing anxiety urged her to follow him into the house. A new timidity\r\nthrobbed in her heart as she doubtingly approached the door. Never had\r\nshe seen the depths of her father\xe2\x80\x99s simple nature stirred as they had\r\nbeen stirred by her confession. She almost dreaded her next meeting\r\nwith him. She wandered softly to and fro in the hall, with a shyness\r\nunaccountable to herself; with a terror of being discovered and spoken\r\nto by her sister or Miss Garth, which made her nervously susceptible to\r\nthe slightest noises in the house. The door of the morning-room opened\r\nwhile her back was turned toward it. She started violently, as she\r\nlooked round and saw her father in the hall: her heart beat faster and\r\nfaster, and she felt herself turning pale. A second look at him, as he\r\ncame nearer, re-assured her. He was composed again, though not so\r\ncheerful as usual. She noticed that he advanced and spoke to her with a\r\nforbearing gentleness, which was more like his manner to her mother\r\nthan his ordinary manner to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, opening the door for her which he had just\r\nclosed. \xe2\x80\x9cTell your mother all you have told me\xe2\x80\x94and more, if you have\r\nmore to say. She is better prepared for you than I was. We will take\r\nto-day to think of it, Magdalen; and to-morrow you shall know, and\r\nFrank shall know, what we decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes brightened, as they looked into his face and saw the decision\r\nthere already, with the double penetration of her womanhood and her\r\nlove. Happy, and beautiful in her happiness, she put his hand to her\r\nlips, and went, without hesitation, into the morning-room. There, her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s words had smoothed the way for her; there, the first shock of\r\nthe surprise was past and over, and only the pleasure of it remained.\r\nHer mother had been her age once; her mother would know how fond she\r\nwas of Frank. So the coming interview was anticipated in her thoughts;\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94except that there was an unaccountable appearance of restraint in\r\nMrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s first reception of her\xe2\x80\x94was anticipated aright. After a\r\nlittle, the mother\xe2\x80\x99s questions came more and more unreservedly from the\r\nsweet, unforgotten experience of the mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart. She lived again\r\nthrough her own young days of hope and love in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s replies.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the all-important decision was announced in words. Mr.\r\nVanstone took his daughter upstairs into her mother\xe2\x80\x99s room, and there\r\nplaced before her the result of the yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s consultation, and of\r\nthe night\xe2\x80\x99s reflection which had followed it. He spoke with perfect\r\nkindness and self-possession of manner\xe2\x80\x94but in fewer and more serious\r\nwords than usual; and he held his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hand tenderly in his own all\r\nthrough the interview.\r\n\r\nHe informed Magdalen that neither he nor her mother felt themselves\r\njustified in blaming her attachment to Frank. It had been in part,\r\nperhaps, the natural consequence of her childish familiarity with him;\r\nin part, also, the result of the closer intimacy between them which the\r\ntheatrical entertainment had necessarily produced. At the same time, it\r\nwas now the duty of her parents to put that attachment, on both sides,\r\nto a proper test\xe2\x80\x94for her sake, because her happy future was their\r\ndearest care; for Frank\xe2\x80\x99s sake, because they were bound to give him the\r\nopportunity of showing himself worthy of the trust confided in him.\r\nThey were both conscious of being strongly prejudiced in Frank\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\r\nHis father\xe2\x80\x99s eccentric conduct had made the lad the object of their\r\ncompassion and their care from his earliest years. He (and his younger\r\nbrothers) had almost filled the places to them of those other children\r\nof their own whom they had lost. Although they firmly believed their\r\ngood opinion of Frank to be well founded\xe2\x80\x94still, in the interest of\r\ntheir daughter\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, it was necessary to put that opinion firmly\r\nto the proof, by fixing certain conditions, and by interposing a year\r\nof delay between the contemplated marriage and the present time.\r\n\r\nDuring that year, Frank was to remain at the office in London; his\r\nemployers being informed beforehand that family circumstances prevented\r\nhis accepting their offer of employment in China. He was to consider\r\nthis concession as a recognition of the attachment between Magdalen and\r\nhimself, on certain terms only. If, during the year of probation, he\r\nfailed to justify the confidence placed in him\xe2\x80\x94a confidence which had\r\nled Mr. Vanstone to take unreservedly upon himself the whole\r\nresponsibility of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s future prospects\xe2\x80\x94the marriage scheme was to\r\nbe considered, from that moment, as at an end. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe result to which Mr. Vanstone confidently looked forward really\r\noccurred\xe2\x80\x94if Frank\xe2\x80\x99s probationary year proved his claim to the most\r\nprecious trust that could be placed in his hands\xe2\x80\x94then Magdalen herself\r\nshould reward him with all that a woman can bestow; and the future,\r\nwhich his present employers had placed before him as the result of a\r\nfive years\xe2\x80\x99 residence in China, should be realized in one year\xe2\x80\x99s time,\r\nby the dowry of his young wife.\r\n\r\nAs her father drew that picture of the future, the outburst of\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude could no longer be restrained. She was deeply\r\ntouched\xe2\x80\x94she spoke from her inmost heart. Mr. Vanstone waited until his\r\ndaughter and his wife were composed again; and then added the last\r\nwords of explanation which were now left for him to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am not anticipating Frank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nliving in idleness on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s means? My plan for him is that he\r\nshould still profit by the interest which his present employers take in\r\nhim. Their knowledge of affairs in the City will soon place a good\r\npartnership at his disposal, and you will give him the money to buy it\r\nout of hand. I shall limit the sum, my dear, to half your fortune; and\r\nthe other half I shall have settled upon yourself. We shall all be\r\nalive and hearty, I hope\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked tenderly at his wife as he said\r\nthose words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call alive and hearty at the year\xe2\x80\x99s end. But if I am gone,\r\nMagdalen, it will make no difference. My will\xe2\x80\x94made long before I ever\r\nthought of having a son-in-law divides my fortune into two equal parts.\r\nOne part goes to your mother; and the other part is fairly divided\r\nbetween my children. You will have your share on your wedding-day (and\r\nNorah will have hers when she marries) from my own hand, if I live; and\r\nunder my will if I die. There! there! no gloomy faces,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a\r\nmomentary return of his every-day good spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother and I mean\r\nto live and see Frank a great merchant. I shall leave you, my dear, to\r\nenlighten the son on our new projects, while I walk over to the\r\ncottage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped; his eyebrows contracted a little; and he looked aside\r\nhesitatingly at Mrs. Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must you do at the cottage, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, after having\r\nvainly waited for him to finish the sentence of his own accord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must consult Frank\xe2\x80\x99s father,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must not forget that\r\nMr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s consent is still wanting to settle this matter. And as time\r\npresses, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what difficulties he may not raise, the\r\nsooner I see him the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave that answer in low, altered tones; and rose from his chair in a\r\nhalf-reluctant, half-resigned manner, which Magdalen observed with\r\nsecret alarm.\r\n\r\nShe glanced inquiringly at her mother. To all appearance, Mrs. Vanstone\r\nhad been alarmed by the change in him also. She looked anxious and\r\nuneasy; she turned her face away on the sofa pillow\xe2\x80\x94turned it suddenly,\r\nas if she was in pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not well, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite well, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanstone, shortly and sharply, without\r\nturning round. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me a little\xe2\x80\x94I only want rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen went out with her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered anxiously, as they descended the stairs; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think Mr. Clare will say No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell beforehand,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope he will say\r\nYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason why he should say anything else\xe2\x80\x94is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put the question faintly, while he was getting his hat and stick;\r\nand he did not appear to hear her. Doubting whether she should repeat\r\nit or not, she accompanied him as far as the garden, on his way to Mr.\r\nClare\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. He stopped her on the lawn, and sent her back to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing on your head, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to be\r\nin the garden, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget how hot the sun is\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t come out without\r\nyour hat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked on toward the cottage.\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment, and looked after him. She missed the customary\r\nflourish of his stick; she saw his little Scotch terrier, who had run\r\nout at his heels, barking and capering about him unnoticed. He was out\r\nof spirits: he was strangely out of spirits. What did it mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the house, Magdalen felt her shoulder suddenly touched\r\nfrom behind as she crossed the hall. She turned and confronted her\r\nsister. Before she could ask any questions, Norah confusedly addressed\r\nher, in these words: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon; I beg you to forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen looked at her sister in astonishment. All memory, on her side,\r\nof the sharp words which had passed between them in the shrubbery was\r\nlost in the new interests that now absorbed her; lost as completely as\r\nif the angry interview had never taken place. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated, amazedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of your new prospects,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Norah, speaking with a\r\nmechanical submissiveness of manner which seemed almost ungracious; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwished to set things right between us; I wished to say I was sorry for\r\nwhat happened. Will you forget it? Will you forget and forgive what\r\nhappened in the shrubbery?\xe2\x80\x9d She tried to proceed; but her inveterate\r\nreserve\xe2\x80\x94or, perhaps, her obstinate reliance on her own\r\nopinions\xe2\x80\x94silenced her at those last words. Her face clouded over on a\r\nsudden. Before her sister could answer her, she turned away abruptly\r\nand ran upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe door of the library opened, before Magdalen could follow her; and\r\nMiss Garth advanced to express the sentiments proper to the occasion.\r\n\r\nThey were not the mechanically-submissive sentiments which Magdalen had\r\njust heard. Norah had struggled against her rooted distrust of Frank,\r\nin deference to the unanswerable decision of both her parents in his\r\nfavor; and had suppressed the open expression of her antipathy, though\r\nthe feeling itself remained unconquered. Miss Garth had made no such\r\nconcession to the master and mistress of the house. She had hitherto\r\nheld the position of a high authority on all domestic questions; and\r\nshe flatly declined to get off her pedestal in deference to any change\r\nin the family circumstances, no matter how amazing or how unexpected\r\nthat change might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray accept my congratulations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth, bristling all over\r\nwith implied objections to Frank\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy congratulations, _and_ my\r\napologies. When I caught you kissing Mr. Francis Clare in the\r\nsummer-house, I had no idea you were engaged in carrying out the\r\nintentions of your parents. I offer no opinion on the subject. I merely\r\nregret my own accidental appearance in the character of an Obstacle to\r\nthe course of true-love\xe2\x80\x94which appears to run smooth in summer-houses,\r\nwhatever Shakespeare may say to the contrary. Consider me for the\r\nfuture, if you please, as an Obstacle removed. May you be happy!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s lips closed on that last sentence like a trap, and Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes looked ominously prophetic into the matrimonial future.\r\n\r\nIf Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties had not been far too serious to allow her the\r\ncustomary free use of her tongue, she would have been ready on the\r\ninstant with an appropriately satirical answer. As it was, Miss Garth\r\nsimply irritated her. \xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94and ran upstairs to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nShe knocked at the door, and there was no answer. She tried the door,\r\nand it resisted her from the inside. The sullen, unmanageable Norah was\r\nlocked in.\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances, Magdalen would not have been satisfied with\r\nknocking\xe2\x80\x94she would have called through the door loudly and more loudly,\r\ntill the house was disturbed and she had carried her point. But the\r\ndoubts and fears of the morning had unnerved her already. She went\r\ndownstairs again softly, and took her hat from the stand in the hall.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me to put my hat on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, with a meek filial\r\ndocility which was totally out of her character.\r\n\r\nShe went into the garden, on the shrubbery side; and waited there to\r\ncatch the first sight of her father on his return. Half an hour passed;\r\nforty minutes passed\xe2\x80\x94and then his voice reached her from among the\r\ndistant trees. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in to heel!\xe2\x80\x9d she heard him call out loudly to the\r\ndog. Her face turned pale. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s angry with Snap!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed to\r\nherself in a whisper. The next minute he appeared in view; walking\r\nrapidly, with his head down and Snap at his heels in disgrace. The\r\nsudden excess of her alarm as she observed those ominous signs of\r\nsomething wrong rallied her natural energy, and determined her\r\ndesperately on knowing the worst. She walked straight forward to meet\r\nher father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour face tells your news,\xe2\x80\x9d she said faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Clare has been as\r\nheartless as usual\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Clare has said No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father turned on her with a sudden severity, so entirely\r\nunparalleled in her experience of him that she started back in\r\ndownright terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever you speak of my old friend and neighbor\r\nagain, bear this in mind: Mr. Clare has just laid me under an\r\nobligation which I shall remember gratefully to the end of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly after saying those remarkable words. Seeing that he\r\nhad startled her, his natural kindness prompted him instantly to soften\r\nthe reproof, and to end the suspense from which she was plainly\r\nsuffering. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a kiss, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you in\r\nreturn that Mr. Clare has said\xe2\x80\x94YES.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe attempted to thank him; but the sudden luxury of relief was too\r\nmuch for her. She could only cling round his neck in silence. He felt\r\nher trembling from head to foot, and said a few words to calm her. At\r\nthe altered tones of his master\xe2\x80\x99s voice, Snap\xe2\x80\x99s meek tail re-appeared\r\nfiercely from between his legs; and Snap\xe2\x80\x99s lungs modestly tested his\r\nposition with a brief, experimental bark. The dog\xe2\x80\x99s quaintly\r\nappropriate assertion of himself on his old footing was the\r\ninterruption of all others which was best fitted to restore Magdalen to\r\nherself. She caught the shaggy little terrier up in her arms and kissed\r\n_him_ next. \xe2\x80\x9cYou darling,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re almost as glad as I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned again to her father, with a look of tender reproach.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou frightened me, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were so unlike yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be right again to-morrow, my dear. I am a little upset\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy something you have heard at Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94nothing you need alarm yourself about; nothing that won\xe2\x80\x99t wear off\r\nby to-morrow. Let me go now, my dear; I have a letter to write; and I\r\nwant to speak to your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left her and went on to the house. Magdalen lingered a little on the\r\nlawn, to feel all the happiness of her new sensations\xe2\x80\x94then turned away\r\ntoward the shrubbery to enjoy the higher luxury of communicating them.\r\nThe dog followed her. She whistled, and clapped her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cFind him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, with beaming eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cFind Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d Snap scampered into the\r\nshrubbery, with a bloodthirsty snarl at starting. Perhaps he had\r\nmistaken his young mistress and considered himself her emissary in\r\nsearch of a rat?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Vanstone entered the house. He met his wife slowly\r\ndescending the stairs, and advanced to give her his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cHow has it\r\nended?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, anxiously, as he led her to the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappily\xe2\x80\x94as we hoped it would,\xe2\x80\x9d answered her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cMy old friend\r\nhas justified my opinion of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanstone, fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you feel it, love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked, as her husband arranged the sofa pillows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdid you feel it as\r\npainfully as I feared you would?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a duty to do, my dear\xe2\x80\x94and I did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter replying in those terms, he hesitated. Apparently, he had\r\nsomething more to say\xe2\x80\x94something, perhaps, on the subject of that\r\npassing uneasiness of mind which had been produced by his interview\r\nwith Mr. Clare, and which Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s questions had obliged him to\r\nacknowledge. A look at his wife decided his doubts in the negative. He\r\nonly asked if she felt comfortable; and then turned away to leave the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you go?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a letter to write, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything about Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: to-morrow will do for that. A letter to Mr. Pendril. I want him\r\nhere immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear\xe2\x80\x94business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out, and shut himself into the little front room, close to the\r\nhall door, which was called his study. By nature and habit the most\r\nprocrastinating of letter-writers, he now inconsistently opened his\r\ndesk and took up the pen without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay. His letter was long\r\nenough to occupy three pages of note-paper; it was written with a\r\nreadiness of expression and a rapidity of hand which seldom\r\ncharacterized his proceedings when engaged over his ordinary\r\ncorrespondence. He wrote the address as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cImmediate\xe2\x80\x94William\r\nPendril, Esq., Serle Street, Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, London\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then pushed the\r\nletter away from him, and sat at the table, drawing lines on the\r\nblotting-paper with his pen, lost in thought. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do nothing more till Pendril comes.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose; his face\r\nbrightened as he put the stamp on the envelope. The writing of the\r\nletter had sensibly relieved him, and his whole bearing showed it as he\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nOn the doorstep he found Norah and Miss Garth, setting forth together\r\nfor a walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere near the post-office? I\r\nwish you would post this letter for me, Norah. It is very important\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nimportant that I hardly like to trust it to Thomas, as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah at once took charge of the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d continued her father, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will see that I am\r\nwriting to Mr. Pendril. I expect him here to-morrow afternoon. Will you\r\ngive the necessary directions, Miss Garth? Mr. Pendril will sleep here\r\nto-morrow night, and stay over Sunday.\xe2\x80\x94Wait a minute! Today is Friday.\r\nSurely I had an engagement for Saturday afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d He consulted his\r\npocketbook and read over one of the entries, with a look of annoyance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrailsea Mill, three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Saturday. Just the time when Pendril\r\nwill be here; and I _must_ be at home to see him. How can I manage it?\r\nMonday will be too late for my business at Grailsea. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to-day,\r\ninstead; and take my chance of catching the miller at his dinner-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cNo time for driving; I must do it by railway.\r\nIf I go at once, I shall catch the down train at our station, and get\r\non to Grailsea. Take care of the letter, Norah. I won\xe2\x80\x99t keep dinner\r\nwaiting; if the return train doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit, I\xe2\x80\x99ll borrow a gig and get\r\nback in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he took up his hat, Magdalen appeared at the door, returning from\r\nher interview with Frank. The hurry of her father\xe2\x80\x99s movements attracted\r\nher attention; and she asked him where he was going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Grailsea,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cYour business, Miss Magdalen, has\r\ngot in the way of mine\xe2\x80\x94and mine must give way to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke those parting words in his old hearty manner; and left them,\r\nwith the old characteristic flourish of his trusty stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy business!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought my business was done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth pointed significantly to the letter in Norah\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nbusiness, beyond all doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pendril is coming tomorrow;\r\nand Mr. Vanstone seems remarkably anxious about it. Law, and its\r\nattendant troubles already! Governesses who look in at summer-house\r\ndoors are not the only obstacles to the course of true-love. Parchment\r\nis sometimes an obstacle. I hope you may find Parchment as pliable as I\r\nam\xe2\x80\x94I wish you well through it. Now, Norah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s second shaft struck as harmless as the first. Magdalen had\r\nreturned to the house, a little vexed; her interview with Frank having\r\nbeen interrupted by a messenger from Mr. Clare, sent to summon the son\r\ninto the father\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Although it had been agreed at the private\r\ninterview between Mr. Vanstone and Mr. Clare that the questions\r\ndiscussed that morning should not be communicated to the children until\r\nthe year of probation was at an end\xe2\x80\x94-and although under these\r\ncircumstances Mr. Clare had nothing to tell Frank which Magdalen could\r\nnot communicate to him much more agreeably\xe2\x80\x94the philosopher was not the\r\nless resolved on personally informing his son of the parental\r\nconcession which rescued him from Chinese exile. The result was a\r\nsudden summons to the cottage, which startled Magdalen, but which did\r\nnot appear to take Frank by surprise. His filial experience penetrated\r\nthe mystery of Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s motives easily enough. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen my father\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nspirits,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sulkily, \xe2\x80\x9che likes to bully me about my good luck.\r\nThis message means that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to bully me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Frank. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never hear the last of it if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99s primed and loaded, and he means to go off. He went off,\r\nonce, when the engineer took me; he went off, twice, when the office in\r\nthe City took me; and he\xe2\x80\x99s going off, thrice, now _you\xe2\x80\x99ve_ taken me. If\r\nit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for you, I should wish I had never been born. Yes; your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s been kind to me, I know\xe2\x80\x94and I should have gone to China, if it\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for him. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged. Of course, we have\r\nno right to expect anything else\xe2\x80\x94still it\xe2\x80\x99s discouraging to keep us\r\nwaiting a year, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen stopped his mouth by a summary process, to which even Frank\r\nsubmitted gratefully. At the same time, she did not forget to set down\r\nhis discontent to the right side. \xe2\x80\x9cHow fond he is of me!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year\xe2\x80\x99s waiting is quite a hardship to him.\xe2\x80\x9d She returned to the\r\nhouse, secretly regretting that she had not heard more of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplimentary complaints. Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s elaborate satire, addressed to\r\nher while she was in this frame of mind, was a purely gratuitous waste\r\nof Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s breath. What did Magdalen care for satire? What do\r\nYouth and Love ever care for except themselves? She never even said as\r\nmuch as \xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d this time. She laid aside her hat in serene silence,\r\nand sauntered languidly into the morning-room to keep her mother\r\ncompany. She lunched on dire forebodings of a quarrel between Frank and\r\nhis father, with accidental interruptions in the shape of cold chicken\r\nand cheese-cakes. She trifled away half an hour at the piano; and\r\nplayed, in that time, selections from the Songs of Mendelssohn, the\r\nMazurkas of Chopin, the Operas of Verdi, and the Sonatas of Mozart\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nof whom had combined together on this occasion and produced one\r\nimmortal work, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cFrank.\xe2\x80\x9d She closed the piano and went up to\r\nher room, to dream away the hours luxuriously in visions of her married\r\nfuture. The green shutters were closed, the easy-chair was pushed in\r\nfront of the glass, the maid was summoned as usual; and the comb\r\nassisted the mistress\xe2\x80\x99s reflections, through the medium of the\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s hair, till heat and idleness asserted their narcotic\r\ninfluences together, and Magdalen fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was past three o\xe2\x80\x99clock when she woke. On going downstairs again she\r\nfound her mother, Norah and Miss Garth all sitting together enjoying\r\nthe shade and the coolness under the open portico in front of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nNorah had the railway time-table in her hand. They had been discussing\r\nthe chances of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s catching the return train and getting\r\nback in good time. That topic had led them, next, to his business\r\nerrand at Grailsea\xe2\x80\x94an errand of kindness, as usual; undertaken for the\r\nbenefit of the miller, who had been his old farm-servant, and who was\r\nnow hard pressed by serious pecuniary difficulties. From this they had\r\nglided insensibly into a subject often repeated among them, and never\r\nexhausted by repetition\xe2\x80\x94the praise of Mr. Vanstone himself. Each one of\r\nthe three had some experience of her own to relate of his simple,\r\ngenerous nature. The conversation seemed to be almost painfully\r\ninteresting to his wife. She was too near the time of her trial now not\r\nto feel nervously sensitive to the one subject which always held the\r\nforemost place in her heart. Her eyes overflowed as Magdalen joined the\r\nlittle group under the portico; her frail hand trembled as it signed to\r\nher youngest daughter to take the vacant chair by her side. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were\r\ntalking of your father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my love, if your\r\nmarried life is only as happy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice failed her; she put her\r\nhandkerchief hurriedly over her face and rested her head on Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder. Norah looked appealingly to Miss Garth, who at once led the\r\nconversation back to the more trivial subject of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have all been wondering,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a significant look at\r\nMagdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether your father will leave Grailsea in time to catch the\r\ntrain\xe2\x80\x94or whether he will miss it and be obliged to drive back. What do\r\nyou say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, papa will miss the train,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, taking Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s hint with her customary quickness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing he attends\r\nto at Grailsea will be the business that brings him there. Whenever he\r\nhas business to do, he always puts it off to the last moment, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question roused her mother exactly as Magdalen had intended it\r\nshould. \xe2\x80\x9cNot when his errand is an errand of kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nVanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone to help the miller in a very pressing\r\ndifficulty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you know what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll romp\r\nwith the miller\xe2\x80\x99s children, and gossip with the mother, and hob-and-nob\r\nwith the father. At the last moment when he has got five minutes left\r\nto catch the train, he\xe2\x80\x99ll say: \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s go into the counting-house and\r\nlook at the books.\xe2\x80\x99 He\xe2\x80\x99ll find the books dreadfully complicated; he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsuggest sending for an accountant; he\xe2\x80\x99ll settle the business off hand,\r\nby lending the money in the meantime; he\xe2\x80\x99ll jog back comfortably in the\r\nmiller\xe2\x80\x99s gig; and he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell us all how pleasant the lanes were in the\r\ncool of the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little character-sketch which these words drew was too faithful a\r\nlikeness not to be recognized. Mrs. Vanstone showed her appreciation of\r\nit by a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen your father returns,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will put your\r\naccount of his proceedings to the test. I think,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, rising\r\nlanguidly from her chair, \xe2\x80\x9cI had better go indoors again now and rest\r\non the sofa till he comes back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little group under the portico broke up. Magdalen slipped away into\r\nthe garden to hear Frank\xe2\x80\x99s account of the interview with his father.\r\nThe other three ladies entered the house together. When Mrs. Vanstone\r\nwas comfortably established on the sofa, Norah and Miss Garth left her\r\nto repose, and withdrew to the library to look over the last parcel of\r\nbooks from London.\r\n\r\nIt was a quiet, cloudless summer\xe2\x80\x99s day. The heat was tempered by a\r\nlight western breeze; the voices of laborers at work in a field near\r\nreached the house cheerfully; the clock-bell of the village church as\r\nit struck the quarters floated down the wind with a clearer ring, a\r\nlouder melody than usual. Sweet odors from field and flower-garden,\r\nstealing in at the open windows, filled the house with their fragrance;\r\nand the birds in Norah\xe2\x80\x99s aviary upstairs sang the song of their\r\nhappiness exultingly in the sun.\r\n\r\nAs the church clock struck the quarter past four, the morning-room door\r\nopened; and Mrs. Vanstone crossed the hall alone. She had tried vainly\r\nto compose herself. She was too restless to lie still and sleep. For a\r\nmoment she directed her steps toward the portico\xe2\x80\x94then turned, and\r\nlooked about her, doubtful where to go, or what to do next. While she\r\nwas still hesitating, the half-open door of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s study\r\nattracted her attention. The room seemed to be in sad confusion.\r\nDrawers were left open; coats and hats, account-books and papers, pipes\r\nand fishing-rods were all scattered about together. She went in, and\r\npushed the door to\xe2\x80\x94but so gently that she still left it ajar. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will\r\namuse me to put his room to rights,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nlike to do something for him before I am down on my bed, helpless.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nbegan to arrange his drawers, and found his banker\xe2\x80\x99s book lying open in\r\none of them. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear, how careless he is! The servants might have\r\nseen all his affairs, if I had not happened to have looked in.\xe2\x80\x9d She set\r\nthe drawers right; and then turned to the multifarious litter on a\r\nside-table. A little old-fashioned music-book appeared among the\r\nscattered papers, with her name written in it, in faded ink. She\r\nblushed like a young girl in the first happiness of the discovery. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ngood he is to me! He remembers my poor old music-book, and keeps it for\r\nmy sake.\xe2\x80\x9d As she sat down by the table and opened the book, the bygone\r\ntime came back to her in all its tenderness. The clock struck the\r\nhalf-hour, struck the three-quarters\xe2\x80\x94and still she sat there, with the\r\nmusic-book on her lap, dreaming happily over the old songs; thinking\r\ngratefully of the golden days when his hand had turned the pages for\r\nher, when his voice had whispered the words which no woman\xe2\x80\x99s memory\r\never forgets.\r\n\r\nNorah roused herself from the volume she was reading, and glanced at\r\nthe clock on the library mantel-piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf papa comes back by the railway,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9che will be here in ten\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth started, and looked up drowsily from the book which was just\r\ndropping out of her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will come by train,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will jog\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94as Magdalen flippantly expressed it\xe2\x80\x94in the miller\xe2\x80\x99s gig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she said the words, there was a knock at the library door. The\r\nfootman appeared, and addressed himself to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person wishes to see you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. A stranger to me\xe2\x80\x94a respectable-looking man\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\nsaid he particularly wished to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth went out into the hall. The footman closed the library door\r\nafter her, and withdrew down the kitchen stairs.\r\n\r\nThe man stood just inside the door, on the mat. His eyes wandered, his\r\nface was pale\xe2\x80\x94he looked ill; he looked frightened. He trifled nervously\r\nwith his cap, and shifted it backward and forward, from one hand to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x94You are not Mrs. Vanstone, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. I am Miss Garth. Why do you ask the question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am employed in the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office at Grailsea Station\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sent here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped again. His wandering eyes looked down at the mat, and his\r\nrestless hands wrung his cap harder and harder. He moistened his dry\r\nlips, and tried once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sent here on a very serious errand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerious to _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerious to all in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth took one step nearer to him\xe2\x80\x94took one steady look at his\r\nface. She turned cold in the summer heat. \xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a\r\nsudden distrust, and glanced aside anxiously at the door of the\r\nmorning-room. It was safely closed. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me the worst; and don\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\nloud. There has been an accident. Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the railway. Close to Grailsea Station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe up-train to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: the down-train at one-fifty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty help us! The train Mr. Vanstone traveled by to Grailsea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same. I was sent here by the up-train; the line was just cleared\r\nin time for it. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t write\xe2\x80\x94they said I must see \xe2\x80\x98Miss Garth,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand tell her. There are seven passengers badly hurt; and two\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next word failed on his lips; he raised his hand in the dead\r\nsilence. With eyes that opened wide in horror, he raised his hand and\r\npointed over Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\nShe turned a little, and looked back.\r\n\r\nFace to face with her, on the threshold of the study door, stood the\r\nmistress of the house. She held her old music-book clutched fast\r\nmechanically in both hands. She stood, the specter of herself. With a\r\ndreadful vacancy in her eyes, with a dreadful stillness in her voice,\r\nshe repeated the man\xe2\x80\x99s last words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven passengers badly hurt; and two\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tortured fingers relaxed their hold; the book dropped from them;\r\nshe sank forward heavily. Miss Garth caught her before she fell\xe2\x80\x94caught\r\nher, and turned upon the man, with the wife\xe2\x80\x99s swooning body in her\r\narms, to hear the husband\xe2\x80\x99s fate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe harm is done,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may speak out. Is he wounded, or\r\ndead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nThe sun sank lower; the western breeze floated cool and fresh into the\r\nhouse. As the evening advanced, the cheerful ring of the village clock\r\ncame nearer and nearer. Field and flower-garden felt the influence of\r\nthe hour, and shed their sweetest fragrance. The birds in Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naviary sunned themselves in the evening stillness, and sang their\r\nfarewell gratitude to the dying day.\r\n\r\nStaggered in its progress for a time only, the pitiless routine of the\r\nhouse went horribly on its daily way. The panic-stricken servants took\r\ntheir blind refuge in the duties proper to the hour. The footman softly\r\nlaid the table for dinner. The maid sat waiting in senseless doubt,\r\nwith the hot-water jugs for the bedrooms ranged near her in their\r\ncustomary row. The gardener, who had been ordered to come to his\r\nmaster, with vouchers for money that he had paid in excess of his\r\ninstructions, said his character was dear to him, and left the vouchers\r\nat his appointed time. Custom that never yields, and Death that never\r\nspares, met on the wreck of human happiness\xe2\x80\x94and Death gave way.\r\n\r\nHeavily the thunder-clouds of Affliction had gathered over the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94heavily, but not at their darkest yet. At five, that evening, the\r\nshock of the calamity had struck its blow. Before another hour had\r\npassed, the disclosure of the husband\xe2\x80\x99s sudden death was followed by\r\nthe suspense of the wife\xe2\x80\x99s mortal peril. She lay helpless on her\r\nwidowed bed; her own life, and the life of her unborn child, trembling\r\nin the balance.\r\n\r\nBut one mind still held possession of its resources\xe2\x80\x94but one guiding\r\nspirit now moved helpfully in the house of mourning.\r\n\r\nIf Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s early days had been passed as calmly and as happily as\r\nher later life at Combe-Raven, she might have sunk under the cruel\r\nnecessities of the time. But the governess\xe2\x80\x99s youth had been tried in\r\nthe ordeal of family affliction; and she met her terrible duties with\r\nthe steady courage of a woman who had learned to suffer. Alone, she had\r\nfaced the trial of telling the daughters that they were fatherless.\r\nAlone, she now struggled to sustain them, when the dreadful certainty\r\nof their bereavement was at last impressed on their minds.\r\n\r\nHer least anxiety was for the elder sister. The agony of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s grief\r\nhad forced its way outward to the natural relief of tears. It was not\r\nso with Magdalen. Tearless and speechless, she sat in the room where\r\nthe revelation of her father\xe2\x80\x99s death had first reached her; her face,\r\nunnaturally petrified by the sterile sorrow of old age\xe2\x80\x94a white,\r\nchangeless blank, fearful to look at. Nothing roused, nothing melted\r\nher. She only said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me; don\xe2\x80\x99t touch me. Let me bear it\r\nby myself\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and fell silent again. The first great grief which had\r\ndarkened the sisters\xe2\x80\x99 lives had, as it seemed, changed their everyday\r\ncharacters already.\r\n\r\nThe twilight fell, and faded; and the summer night came brightly. As\r\nthe first carefully shaded light was kindled in the sick-room, the\r\nphysician, who had been summoned from Bristol, arrived to consult with\r\nthe medical attendant of the family. He could give no comfort: he could\r\nonly say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must try, and hope. The shock which struck her, when she\r\noverheard the news of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death, has prostrated her strength\r\nat the time when she needed it most. No effort to preserve her shall be\r\nneglected. I will stay here for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened one of the windows to admit more air as he spoke. The view\r\noverlooked the drive in front of the house and the road outside. Little\r\ngroups of people were standing before the lodge-gates, looking in. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthose persons make any noise,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cthey must be warned\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d There was no need to warn them: they were only the laborers who\r\nhad worked on the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s property, and here and there some women\r\nand children from the village. They were all thinking of him\xe2\x80\x94some\r\ntalking of him\xe2\x80\x94and it quickened their sluggish minds to look at his\r\nhouse. The gentlefolks thereabouts were mostly kind to them (the men\r\nsaid), but none like _him_. The women whispered to each other of his\r\ncomforting ways when he came into their cottages. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a cheerful\r\nman, poor soul; and thoughtful of us, too: he never came in and stared\r\nat meal-times; the rest of \xe2\x80\x99em help us, and scold us\xe2\x80\x94all _he_ ever said\r\nwas, better luck next time.\xe2\x80\x9d So they stood and talked of him, and\r\nlooked at his house and grounds and moved off clumsily by twos and\r\nthrees, with the dim sense that the sight of his pleasant face would\r\nnever comfort them again. The dullest head among them knew, that night,\r\nthat the hard ways of poverty would be all the harder to walk on, now\r\nhe was gone.\r\n\r\nA little later, news was brought to the bed-chamber door that old Mr.\r\nClare had come alone to the house, and was waiting in the hall below,\r\nto hear what the physician said. Miss Garth was not able to go down to\r\nhim herself: she sent a message. He said to the servant, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come and\r\nask again, in two hours\xe2\x80\x99 time\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and went out slowly. Unlike other men in\r\nall things else, the sudden death of his old friend had produced no\r\ndiscernible change in him. The feeling implied in the errand of inquiry\r\nthat had brought him to the house was the one betrayal of human\r\nsympathy which escaped the rugged, impenetrable old man.\r\n\r\nHe came again, when the two hours had expired; and this time Miss Garth\r\nsaw him.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands in silence. She waited; she nerved herself to hear him\r\nspeak of his lost friend. No: he never mentioned the dreadful accident,\r\nhe never alluded to the dreadful death. He said these words, \xe2\x80\x9cIs she\r\nbetter, or worse?\xe2\x80\x9d and said no more. Was the tribute of his grief for\r\nthe husband sternly suppressed under the expression of his anxiety for\r\nthe wife? The nature of the man, unpliably antagonistic to the world\r\nand the world\xe2\x80\x99s customs, might justify some such interpretation of his\r\nconduct as this. He repeated his question, \xe2\x80\x9cIs she better, or worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth answered him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo better; if there is any change, it is a change for the worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey spoke those words at the window of the morning-room which opened\r\non the garden. Mr. Clare paused, after hearing the reply to his\r\ninquiry, stepped out on to the walk, then turned on a sudden, and spoke\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the doctor given her up?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not concealed from us that she is in danger. We can only pray\r\nfor her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man laid his hand on Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s arm as she answered him, and\r\nlooked her attentively in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe in prayer?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMiss Garth drew sorrowfully back from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have spared me that question sir, at such a time as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took no notice of her answer; his eyes were still fastened on her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPray as you never prayed before, for the preservation\r\nof Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left her. His voice and manner implied some unutterable dread of the\r\nfuture, which his words had not confessed. Miss Garth followed him into\r\nthe garden, and called to him. He heard her, but he never turned back:\r\nhe quickened his pace, as if he desired to avoid her. She watched him\r\nacross the lawn in the warm summer moonlight. She saw his white,\r\nwithered hands, saw them suddenly against the black background of the\r\nshrubbery, raised and wrung above his head. They dropped\xe2\x80\x94the trees\r\nshrouded him in darkness\xe2\x80\x94he was gone.\r\n\r\nMiss Garth went back to the suffering woman, with the burden on her\r\nmind of one anxiety more.\r\n\r\nIt was then past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Some little time had elapsed since she\r\nhad seen the sisters and spoken to them. The inquiries she addressed to\r\none of the female servants only elicited the information that they were\r\nboth in their rooms. She delayed her return to the mother\xe2\x80\x99s bedside to\r\nsay her parting words of comfort to the daughters, before she left them\r\nfor the night. Norah\xe2\x80\x99s room was the nearest. She softly opened the door\r\nand looked in. The kneeling figure by the bedside told her that God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelp had found the fatherless daughter in her affliction. Grateful\r\ntears gathered in her eyes as she looked: she softly closed the door,\r\nand went on to Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s room. There doubt stayed her feet at the\r\nthreshold, and she waited for a moment before going in.\r\n\r\nA sound in the room caught her ear\xe2\x80\x94the monotonous rustling of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress, now distant, now near; passing without cessation from end to end\r\nover the floor\xe2\x80\x94a sound which told her that Magdalen was pacing to and\r\nfro in the secrecy of her own chamber. Miss Garth knocked. The rustling\r\nceased; the door was opened, and the sad young face confronted her,\r\nlocked in its cold despair; the large light eyes looked mechanically\r\ninto hers, as vacant and as tearless as ever.\r\n\r\nThat look wrung the heart of the faithful woman, who had trained her\r\nand loved her from a child. She took Magdalen tenderly in her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cno tears yet! Oh, if I could see you as I\r\nhave seen Norah! Speak to me, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94try if you can speak to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried, and spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfeels no remorse. He was not serving Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterests when he went to his death: he was serving mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that terrible answer, she put her cold lips to Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me bear it by myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and gently closed the door.\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Garth waited at the threshold, and again the sound of the\r\nrustling dress passed to and fro\xe2\x80\x94now far, now near\xe2\x80\x94to and fro with a\r\ncruel, mechanical regularity, that chilled the warmest sympathy, and\r\ndaunted the boldest hope.\r\n\r\nThe night passed. It had been agreed, if no change for the better\r\nshowed itself by the morning, that the London physician whom Mrs.\r\nVanstone had consulted some months since should be summoned to the\r\nhouse on the next day. No change for the better appeared, and the\r\nphysician was sent for.\r\n\r\nAs the morning advanced, Frank came to make inquiries from the cottage.\r\nHad Mr. Clare intrusted to his son the duty which he had personally\r\nperformed on the previous day through reluctance to meet Miss Garth\r\nagain after what he had said to her? It might be so. Frank could throw\r\nno light on the subject; he was not in his father\xe2\x80\x99s confidence. He\r\nlooked pale and bewildered. His first inquiries after Magdalen showed\r\nhow his weak nature had been shaken by the catastrophe. He was not\r\ncapable of framing his own questions: the words faltered on his lips,\r\nand the ready tears came into his eyes. Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s heart warmed to\r\nhim for the first time. Grief has this that is noble in it\xe2\x80\x94it accepts\r\nall sympathy, come whence it may. She encouraged the lad by a few kind\r\nwords, and took his hand at parting.\r\n\r\nBefore noon Frank returned with a second message. His father desired to\r\nknow whether Mr. Pendril was not expected at Combe-Raven on that day.\r\nIf the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s arrival was looked for, Frank was directed to be in\r\nattendance at the station, and to take him to the cottage, where a bed\r\nwould be placed at his disposal. This message took Miss Garth by\r\nsurprise. It showed that Mr. Clare had been made acquainted with his\r\ndead friend\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of sending for Mr. Pendril. Was the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoughtful offer of hospitality another indirect expression of the\r\nnatural human distress which he perversely concealed? or was he aware\r\nof some secret necessity for Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s presence, of which the\r\nbereaved family had been kept in total ignorance? Miss Garth was too\r\nheart-sick and hopeless to dwell on either question. She told Frank\r\nthat Mr. Pendril had been expected at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and sent him back\r\nwith her thanks.\r\n\r\nShortly after his departure, such anxieties on Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s account as\r\nher mind was now able to feel were relieved by better news than her\r\nlast night\xe2\x80\x99s experience had inclined her to hope for. Norah\xe2\x80\x99s influence\r\nhad been exerted to rouse her sister; and Norah\xe2\x80\x99s patient sympathy had\r\nset the prisoned grief free. Magdalen had suffered severely\xe2\x80\x94suffered\r\ninevitably, with such a nature as hers\xe2\x80\x94in the effort that relieved her.\r\nThe healing tears had not come gently; they had burst from her with a\r\ntorturing, passionate vehemence\xe2\x80\x94but Norah had never left her till the\r\nstruggle was over, and the calm had come. These better tidings\r\nencouraged Miss Garth to withdraw to her own room, and to take the rest\r\nwhich she needed sorely. Worn out in body and mind, she slept from\r\nsheer exhaustion\xe2\x80\x94slept heavily and dreamless for some hours. It was\r\nbetween three and four in the afternoon when she was roused by one of\r\nthe female servants. The woman had a note in her hand\xe2\x80\x94a note left by\r\nMr. Clare the younger, with a message desiring that it might be\r\ndelivered to Miss Garth immediately. The name written in the lower\r\ncorner of the envelope was \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam Pendril.\xe2\x80\x9d The lawyer had arrived.\r\n\r\nMiss Garth opened the note. After a few first sentences of sympathy and\r\ncondolence, the writer announced his arrival at Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s; and then\r\nproceeded, apparently in his professional capacity, to make a very\r\nstartling request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cany change for the better in Mrs. Vanstone should take\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94whether it is only an improvement for the time, or whether it is\r\nthe permanent improvement for which we all hope\xe2\x80\x94in either case I\r\nentreat you to let me know of it immediately. It is of the last\r\nimportance that I should see her, in the event of her gaining strength\r\nenough to give me her attention for five minutes, and of her being able\r\nat the expiration of that time to sign her name. May I beg that you\r\nwill communicate my request, in the strictest confidence, to the\r\nmedical men in attendance? They will understand, and you will\r\nunderstand, the vital importance I attach to this interview when I tell\r\nyou that I have arranged to defer to it all other business claims on\r\nme; and that I hold myself in readiness to obey your summons at any\r\nhour of the day or night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those terms the letter ended. Miss Garth read it twice over. At the\r\nsecond reading the request which the lawyer now addressed to her, and\r\nthe farewell words which had escaped Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s lips the day before,\r\nconnected themselves vaguely in her mind. There was some other serious\r\ninterest in suspense, known to Mr. Pendril and known to Mr. Clare,\r\nbesides the first and foremost interest of Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.\r\nWhom did it affect? The children? Were they threatened by some new\r\ncalamity which their mother\xe2\x80\x99s signature might avert? What did it mean?\r\nDid it mean that Mr. Vanstone had died without leaving a will?\r\n\r\nIn her distress and confusion of mind Miss Garth was incapable of\r\nreasoning with herself, as she might have reasoned at a happier time.\r\nShe hastened to the antechamber of Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s room; and, after\r\nexplaining Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s position toward the family, placed his letter\r\nin the hands of the medical men. They both answered, without\r\nhesitation, to the same purpose. Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s condition rendered any\r\nsuch interview as the lawyer desired a total impossibility. If she\r\nrallied from her present prostration, Miss Garth should be at once\r\ninformed of the improvement. In the meantime, the answer to Mr. Pendril\r\nmight be conveyed in one word\xe2\x80\x94Impossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see what importance Mr. Pendril attaches to the interview?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Garth.\r\n\r\nYes: both the doctors saw it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind is lost and confused, gentlemen, in this dreadful suspense.\r\nCan you either of you guess why the signature is wanted? or what the\r\nobject of the interview may be? I have only seen Mr. Pendril when he\r\nhas come here on former visits: I have no claim to justify me in\r\nquestioning him. Will you look at the letter again? Do you think it\r\nimplies that Mr. Vanstone has never made a will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it can hardly imply that,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the doctors. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, even\r\nsupposing Mr. Vanstone to have died intestate, the law takes due care\r\nof the interests of his widow and his children\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it do so,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the other medical man, \xe2\x80\x9cif the property\r\nhappened to be in land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure in that case. Do you happen to know, Miss Garth, whether\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s property was in money or in land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn money,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard him say so on more than\r\none occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I can relieve your mind by speaking from my own experience. The\r\nlaw, if he has died intestate, gives a third of his property to his\r\nwidow, and divides the rest equally among his children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mrs. Vanstone should die,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the doctor, completing the\r\nquestion which Miss Garth had not the heart to conclude for herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbelieve I am right in telling you that the property would, as a matter\r\nof legal course, go to the children. Whatever necessity there may be\r\nfor the interview which Mr. Pendril requests, I can see no reason for\r\nconnecting it with the question of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s presumed intestacy.\r\nBut, by all means, put the question, for the satisfaction of your own\r\nmind, to Mr. Pendril himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth withdrew to take the course which the doctor advised. After\r\ncommunicating to Mr. Pendril the medical decision which, thus far,\r\nrefused him the interview that he sought, she added a brief statement\r\nof the legal question she had put to the doctors; and hinted delicately\r\nat her natural anxiety to be informed of the motives which had led the\r\nlawyer to make his request. The answer she received was guarded in the\r\nextreme: it did not impress her with a favorable opinion of Mr.\r\nPendril. He confirmed the doctors\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the law in general\r\nterms only; expressed his intention of waiting at the cottage in the\r\nhope that a change for the better might yet enable Mrs. Vanstone to see\r\nhim; and closed his letter without the slightest explanation of his\r\nmotives, and without a word of reference to the question of the\r\nexistence, or the non-existence, of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s will.\r\n\r\nThe marked caution of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s reply dwelt uneasily on Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, until the long-expected event of the day recalled all her\r\nthoughts to her one absorbing anxiety on Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s account.\r\n\r\nEarly in the evening the physician from London arrived. He watched long\r\nby the bedside of the suffering woman; he remained longer still in\r\nconsultation with his medical brethren; he went back again to the\r\nsick-room, before Miss Garth could prevail on him to communicate to her\r\nthe opinion at which he had arrived.\r\n\r\nWhen he called out into the antechamber for the second time, he\r\nsilently took a chair by her side. She looked in his face; and the last\r\nfaint hope died in her before he opened his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must speak the hard truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that _can_ be done\r\n_has_ been done. The next four-and-twenty hours, at most, will end your\r\nsuspense. If Nature makes no effort in that time\xe2\x80\x94I grieve to say it\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nmust prepare yourself for the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words said all: they were prophetic of the end.\r\n\r\nThe night passed; and she lived through it. The next day came; and she\r\nlingered on till the clock pointed to five. At that hour the tidings of\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s death had dealt the mortal blow. When the hour came round\r\nagain, the mercy of God let her go to him in the better world. Her\r\ndaughters were kneeling at the bedside as her spirit passed away. She\r\nleft them unconscious of their presence; mercifully and happily\r\ninsensible to the pang of the last farewell.\r\n\r\nHer child survived her till the evening was on the wane and the sunset\r\nwas dim in the quiet western heaven. As the darkness came, the light of\r\nthe frail little life\xe2\x80\x94faint and feeble from the first\xe2\x80\x94flickered and\r\nwent out. All that was earthly of mother and child lay, that night, on\r\nthe same bed. The Angel of Death had done his awful bidding; and the\r\ntwo Sisters were left alone in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nEarlier than usual on the morning of Thursday, the twenty-third of\r\nJuly, Mr. Clare appeared at the door of his cottage, and stepped out\r\ninto the little strip of garden attached to his residence.\r\n\r\nAfter he had taken a few turns backward and forward, alone, he was\r\njoined by a spare, quiet, gray-haired man, whose personal appearance\r\nwas totally devoid of marked character of any kind; whose inexpressive\r\nface and conventionally-quiet manner presented nothing that attracted\r\napproval and nothing that inspired dislike. This was Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nwas the man on whose lips hung the future of the orphans at\r\nCombe-Raven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time is getting on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking toward the shrubbery, as he\r\njoined Mr. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy appointment with Miss Garth is for eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock: it only wants\r\nten minutes of the hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you to see her alone?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Clare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left Miss Garth to decide\xe2\x80\x94after warning her, first of all, that the\r\ncircumstances I am compelled to disclose are of a very serious nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _has_ she decided?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe writes me word that she mentioned my appointment, and repeated the\r\nwarning I had given her to both the daughters. The elder of the two\r\nshrinks\xe2\x80\x94and who can wonder at it?\xe2\x80\x94from any discussion connected with\r\nthe future which requires her presence so soon as the day after the\r\nfuneral. The younger one appears to have expressed no opinion on the\r\nsubject. As I understand it, she suffers herself to be passively guided\r\nby her sister\xe2\x80\x99s example. My interview, therefore, will take place with\r\nMiss Garth alone\xe2\x80\x94and it is a very great relief to me to know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke the last words with more emphasis and energy than seemed\r\nhabitual to him. Mr. Clare stopped, and looked at his guest\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are almost as old as I am, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHas all your long\r\nexperience as a lawyer not hardened you yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew how little it had hardened me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Pendril,\r\nquietly, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil I returned from London yesterday to attend the funeral.\r\nI was not warned that the daughters had resolved on following their\r\nparents to the grave. I think their presence made the closing scene of\r\nthis dreadful calamity doubly painful, and doubly touching. You saw how\r\nthe great concourse of people were moved by it\xe2\x80\x94and _they_ were in\r\nignorance of the truth; _they_ knew nothing of the cruel necessity\r\nwhich takes me to the house this morning. The sense of that\r\nnecessity\xe2\x80\x94and the sight of those poor girls at the time when I felt my\r\nhard duty toward them most painfully\xe2\x80\x94shook me, as a man of my years and\r\nmy way of life is not often shaken by any distress in the present or\r\nany suspense in the future. I have not recovered it this morning: I\r\nhardly feel sure of myself yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man\xe2\x80\x99s composure\xe2\x80\x94when he is a man like you\xe2\x80\x94comes with the necessity\r\nfor it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have had duties to perform as trying\r\nin their way as the duty that lies before you this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pendril shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cMany duties as serious; many stories more\r\nromantic. No duty so trying, no story so hopeless, as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words they parted. Mr. Pendril left the garden for the\r\nshrubbery path which led to Combe-Raven. Mr. Clare returned to the\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the passage, he looked through the open door of his little\r\nparlor and saw Frank sitting there in idle wretchedness, with his head\r\nresting wearily on his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had an answer from your employers in London,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clare.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn consideration of what has happened, they will allow the offer they\r\nmade you to stand over for another month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank changed color, and rose nervously from his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre my prospects altered?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAre Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s plans for me\r\nnot to be carried out? He told Magdalen his will had provided for her.\r\nShe repeated his words to me; she said I ought to know all that his\r\ngoodness and generosity had done for both of us. How can his death make\r\na change? Has anything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till Mr. Pendril comes back from Combe-Raven,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion him\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t question me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ready tears rose in Frank\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be hard on me?\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to\r\ngo back to London without seeing Magdalen first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clare looked thoughtfully at his son, and considered a little\r\nbefore he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may dry your eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see Magdalen before you go\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the room, after making that reply, and withdrew to his study.\r\nThe books lay ready to his hand as usual. He opened one of them and set\r\nhimself to read in the customary manner. But his attention wandered;\r\nand his eyes strayed away, from time to time, to the empty chair\r\nopposite\xe2\x80\x94the chair in which his old friend and gossip had sat and\r\nwrangled with him good-humoredly for many and many a year past. After a\r\nstruggle with himself he closed the book. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x94n the chair!\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\n_will_ talk of him; and I must listen.\xe2\x80\x9d He reached down his pipe from\r\nthe wall and mechanically filled it with tobacco. His hand shook, his\r\neyes wandered back to the old place; and a heavy sigh came from him\r\nunwillingly. That empty chair was the only earthly argument for which\r\nhe had no answer: his heart owned its defeat and moistened his eyes in\r\nspite of him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has got the better of me at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said the rugged\r\nold man. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is one weak place left in me still\xe2\x80\x94and _he_ has found\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Pendril entered the shrubbery, and followed the path\r\nwhich led to the lonely garden and the desolate house. He was met at\r\nthe door by the man-servant, who was apparently waiting in expectation\r\nof his arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an appointment with Miss Garth. Is she ready to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite ready, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the room which was Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s study?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that room, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant opened the door and Mr. Pendril went in.\r\n\r\nThe governess stood alone at the study window. The morning was\r\noppressively hot, and she threw up the lower sash to admit more air\r\ninto the room, as Mr. Pendril entered it.\r\n\r\nThey bowed to each other with a formal politeness, which betrayed on\r\neither side an uneasy sense of restraint. Mr. Pendril was one of the\r\nmany men who appear superficially to the worst advantage, under the\r\ninfluence of strong mental agitation which it is necessary for them to\r\ncontrol. Miss Garth, on her side, had not forgotten the ungraciously\r\nguarded terms in which the lawyer had replied to her letter; and the\r\nnatural anxiety which she had felt on the subject of the interview was\r\nnot relieved by any favorable opinion of the man who sought it. As they\r\nconfronted each other in the silence of the summer\xe2\x80\x99s morning\xe2\x80\x94both\r\ndressed in black; Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s hard features, gaunt and haggard with\r\ngrief; the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s cold, colorless face, void of all marked\r\nexpression, suggestive of a business embarrassment and of nothing\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94it would have been hard to find two persons less attractive\r\nexternally to any ordinary sympathies than the two who had now met\r\ntogether, the one to tell, the other to hear, the secrets of the dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sincerely sorry, Miss Garth, to intrude on you at such a time as\r\nthis. But circumstances, as I have already explained, leave me no other\r\nchoice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take a seat, Mr. Pendril? You wished to see me in this room,\r\nI believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly in this room, because Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s papers are kept here, and I\r\nmay find it necessary to refer to some of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that formal interchange of question and answer, they sat down on\r\neither side of a table placed close under the window. One waited to\r\nspeak, the other waited to hear. There was a momentary silence. Mr.\r\nPendril broke it by referring to the young ladies, with the customary\r\nexpressions of sympathy. Miss Garth answered him with the same\r\nceremony, in the same conventional tone. There was a second pause of\r\nsilence. The humming of flies among the evergreen shrubs under the\r\nwindow penetrated drowsily into the room; and the tramp of a\r\nheavy-footed cart-horse, plodding along the high-road beyond the\r\ngarden, was as plainly audible in the stillness as if it had been\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer roused his flagging resolution, and spoke to the purpose\r\nwhen he spoke next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have some reason, Miss Garth,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cto feel not quite\r\nsatisfied with my past conduct toward you, in one particular. During\r\nMrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s fatal illness, you addressed a letter to me, making\r\ncertain inquiries; which, while she lived, it was impossible for me to\r\nanswer. Her deplorable death releases me from the restraint which I had\r\nimposed on myself, and permits\xe2\x80\x94or, more properly, obliges me to speak.\r\nYou shall know what serious reasons I had for waiting day and night in\r\nthe hope of obtaining that interview which unhappily never took place;\r\nand in justice to Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s memory, your own eyes shall inform you\r\nthat he made his will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose; unlocked a little iron safe in the corner of the room; and\r\nreturned to the table with some folded sheets of paper, which he spread\r\nopen under Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. When she had read the first words, \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthe name of God, Amen,\xe2\x80\x9d he turned the sheet, and pointed to the end of\r\nthe next page. She saw the well-known signature: \xe2\x80\x9cAndrew Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nsaw the customary attestations of the two witnesses; and the date of\r\nthe document, reverting to a period of more than five years since.\r\nHaving thus convinced her of the formality of the will, the lawyer\r\ninterposed before she could question him, and addressed her in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must not deceive you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have my own reasons for producing\r\nthis document.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reasons, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear them. When you are in possession of the truth, these\r\npages may help to preserve your respect for Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s memory\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth started back in her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a stern straightforwardness.\r\n\r\nHe took no heed of the question; he went on as if she had not\r\ninterrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a second reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cfor showing you the will. If I\r\ncan prevail on you to read certain clauses in it, under my\r\nsuperintendence, you will make your own discovery of the circumstances\r\nwhich I am here to disclose\xe2\x80\x94circumstances so painful that I hardly know\r\nhow to communicate them to you with my own lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth looked him steadfastly in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCircumstances, sir, which affect the dead parents, or the living\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich affect the dead and the living both,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the lawyer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCircumstances, I grieve to say, which involve the future of Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy daughters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth, \xe2\x80\x9cwait a little.\xe2\x80\x9d She pushed her gray hair back\r\nfrom her temples, and struggled with the sickness of heart, the\r\ndreadful faintness of terror, which would have overpowered a younger or\r\na less resolute woman. Her eyes, dim with watching, weary with grief,\r\nsearched the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s unfathomable face. \xe2\x80\x9cHis unhappy daughters?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated to herself, vacantly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe talks as if there was some worse\r\ncalamity than the calamity which has made them orphans.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused\r\nonce more; and rallied her sinking courage. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not make your hard\r\nduty, sir, more painful to you than I can help,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me\r\nthe place in the will. Let me read it, and know the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pendril turned back to the first page, and pointed to a certain\r\nplace in the cramped lines of writing. \xe2\x80\x9cBegin here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe tried to begin; she tried to follow his finger, as she had followed\r\nit already to the signatures and the dates. But her senses seemed to\r\nshare the confusion of her mind\xe2\x80\x94the words mingled together, and the\r\nlines swam before her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t follow you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must tell it, or read it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe pushed her chair back from the table, and tried to collect herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, as the lawyer, with visible hesitation and\r\nreluctance, took the papers in his own hand. \xe2\x80\x9cOne question, first. Does\r\nhis will provide for his children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis will provided for them, when he made it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he made it!\xe2\x80\x9d (Something of her natural bluntness broke out in her\r\nmanner as she repeated the answer.) \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it provide for them now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe snatched the will from his hand, and threw it into a corner of the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou wish to spare me\xe2\x80\x94but you are\r\nwasting your time, and my strength. If the will is useless, there let\r\nit lie. Tell me the truth, Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x94tell it plainly, tell it\r\ninstantly, in your own words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt that it would be useless cruelty to resist that appeal. There\r\nwas no merciful alternative but to answer it on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must refer you to the spring of the present year, Miss Garth. Do you\r\nremember the fourth of March?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer attention wandered again; a thought seemed to have struck her at\r\nthe moment when he spoke. Instead of answering his inquiry, she put a\r\nquestion of her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me break the news to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clet me anticipate you, if\r\nI can. His useless will, the terms in which you speak of his daughters,\r\nthe doubt you seem to feel of my continued respect for his memory, have\r\nopened a new view to me. Mr. Vanstone has died a ruined man\xe2\x80\x94is that\r\nwhat you had to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from it. Mr. Vanstone has died, leaving a fortune of more than\r\neighty thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x94a fortune invested in excellent securities. He\r\nlived up to his income, but never beyond it; and all his debts added\r\ntogether would not reach two hundred pounds. If he had died a ruined\r\nman, I should have felt deeply for his children: but I should not have\r\nhesitated to tell you the truth, as I am hesitating now. Let me repeat\r\na question which escaped you, I think, when I first put it. Carry your\r\nmind back to the spring of this year. Do you remember the fourth of\r\nMarch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMy memory for dates is bad at the best of\r\ntimes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am too confused to exert it at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\nCan you put your question in no other form?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put it in this form:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember any domestic event in the spring of the present year\r\nwhich appeared to affect Mr. Vanstone more seriously than usual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth leaned forward in her chair, and looked eagerly at Mr.\r\nPendril across the table. \xe2\x80\x9cThe journey to London!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndistrusted the journey to London from the first! Yes! I remember Mr.\r\nVanstone receiving a letter\xe2\x80\x94I remember his reading it, and looking so\r\naltered from himself that he startled us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice any apparent understanding between Mr. and Mrs.\r\nVanstone on the subject of that letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: I did. One of the girls\xe2\x80\x94it was Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94mentioned the post-mark;\r\nsome place in America. It all comes back to me, Mr. Pendril. Mrs.\r\nVanstone looked excited and anxious, the moment she heard the place\r\nnamed. They went to London together the next day; they explained\r\nnothing to their daughters, nothing to me. Mrs. Vanstone said the\r\njourney was for family affairs. I suspected something wrong; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell what. Mrs. Vanstone wrote to me from London, saying that her\r\nobject was to consult a physician on the state of her health, and not\r\nto alarm her daughters by telling them. Something in the letter rather\r\nhurt me at the time. I thought there might be some other motive that\r\nshe was keeping from me. Did I do her wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did her no wrong. There was a motive which she was keeping from\r\nyou. In revealing that motive, I reveal the painful secret which brings\r\nme to this house. All that I could do to prepare you, I have done. Let\r\nme now tell the truth in the plainest and fewest words. When Mr. and\r\nMrs. Vanstone left Combe-Raven, in the March of the present year\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he could complete the sentence, a sudden movement of Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s interrupted him. She started violently, and looked round toward\r\nthe window. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the wind among the leaves,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nnerves are so shaken, the least thing startles me. Speak out, for God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake! When Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone left this house, tell me in plain\r\nwords, why did they go to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn plain words, Mr. Pendril told her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey went to London to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that answer he placed a slip of paper on the table. It was the\r\nmarriage certificate of the dead parents, and the date it bore was\r\nMarch the twentieth, eighteen hundred and forty-six.\r\n\r\nMiss Garth neither moved nor spoke. The certificate lay beneath her\r\nunnoticed. She sat with her eyes rooted on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s face; her mind\r\nstunned, her senses helpless. He saw that all his efforts to break the\r\nshock of the discovery had been efforts made in vain; he felt the vital\r\nimportance of rousing her, and firmly and distinctly repeated the fatal\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey went to London to be married,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTry to rouse yourself:\r\ntry to realize the plain fact first: the explanation shall come\r\nafterward. Miss Garth, I speak the miserable truth! In the spring of\r\nthis year they left home; they lived in London for a fortnight, in the\r\nstrictest retirement; they were married by license at the end of that\r\ntime. There is a copy of the certificate, which I myself obtained on\r\nMonday last. Read the date of the marriage for yourself. It is Friday,\r\nthe twentieth of March\xe2\x80\x94the March of this present year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he pointed to the certificate, that faint breath of air among the\r\nshrubs beneath the window, which had startled Miss Garth, stirred the\r\nleaves once more. He heard it himself this time, and turned his face,\r\nso as to let the breeze play upon it. No breeze came; no breath of air\r\nthat was strong enough for him to feel, floated into the room.\r\n\r\nMiss Garth roused herself mechanically, and read the certificate. It\r\nseemed to produce no distinct impression on her: she laid it on one\r\nside in a lost, bewildered manner. \xe2\x80\x9cTwelve years,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in low,\r\nhopeless tones\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctwelve quiet, happy years I lived with this family.\r\nMrs. Vanstone was my friend; my dear, valued friend\xe2\x80\x94my sister, I might\r\nalmost say. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Bear with me a little, sir, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall help you to believe it when I tell you more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nPendril\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou will understand me better when I take you back to the time\r\nof Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s early life. I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask for your attention just yet.\r\nLet us wait a little, until you recover yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey waited a few minutes. The lawyer took some letters from his\r\npocket, referred to them attentively, and put them back again. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you\r\nlisten to me, now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, kindly. She bowed her head in answer. Mr.\r\nPendril considered with himself for a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI must caution you on\r\none point,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the aspect of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s character which I\r\nam now about to present to you seems in some respects at variance with\r\nyour later experience, bear in mind that, when you first knew him\r\ntwelve years since, he was a man of forty; and that, when I first knew\r\nhim, he was a lad of nineteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis next words raised the veil, and showed the irrevocable Past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fortune which Mr. Vanstone possessed when you knew him\xe2\x80\x9d (the\r\nlawyer began) \xe2\x80\x9cwas part, and part only, of the inheritance which fell\r\nto him on his father\xe2\x80\x99s death. Mr. Vanstone the elder was a manufacturer\r\nin the North of England. He married early in life; and the children of\r\nthe marriage were either six or seven in number\xe2\x80\x94I am not certain which.\r\nFirst, Michael, the eldest son, still living, and now an old man turned\r\nseventy. Secondly, Selina, the eldest daughter, who married in\r\nafter-life, and who died ten or eleven years ago. After those two came\r\nother sons and daughters, whose early deaths make it unnecessary to\r\nmention them particularly. The last and by many years the youngest of\r\nthe children was Andrew, whom I first knew, as I told you, at the age\r\nof nineteen. My father was then on the point of retiring from the\r\nactive pursuit of his profession; and in succeeding to his business, I\r\nalso succeeded to his connection with the Vanstones as the family\r\nsolicitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time, Andrew had just started in life by entering the army.\r\nAfter little more than a year of home-service, he was ordered out with\r\nhis regiment to Canada. When he quitted England, he left his father and\r\nhis elder brother Michael seriously at variance. I need not detain you\r\nby entering into the cause of the quarrel. I need only tell you that\r\nthe elder Mr. Vanstone, with many excellent qualities, was a man of\r\nfierce and intractable temper. His eldest son had set him at defiance,\r\nunder circumstances which might have justly irritated a father of far\r\nmilder character; and he declared, in the most positive terms, that he\r\nwould never see Michael\xe2\x80\x99s face again. In defiance of my entreaties, and\r\nof the entreaties of his wife, he tore up, in our presence, the will\r\nwhich provided for Michael\xe2\x80\x99s share in the paternal inheritance. Such\r\nwas the family position, when the younger son left home for Canada.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome months after Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s arrival with his regiment at Quebec, he\r\nbecame acquainted with a woman of great personal attractions, who came,\r\nor said she came, from one of the Southern States of America. She\r\nobtained an immediate influence over him; and she used it to the basest\r\npurpose. You knew the easy, affectionate, trusting nature of the man in\r\nlater life\xe2\x80\x94you can imagine how thoughtlessly he acted on the impulse of\r\nhis youth. It is useless to dwell on this lamentable part of the story.\r\nHe was just twenty-one: he was blindly devoted to a worthless woman;\r\nand she led him on, with merciless cunning, till it was too late to\r\ndraw back. In one word, he committed the fatal error of his life: he\r\nmarried her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had been wise enough in her own interests to dread the influence\r\nof his brother-officers, and to persuade him, up to the period of the\r\nmarriage ceremony, to keep the proposed union between them a secret.\r\nShe could do this; but she could not provide against the results of\r\naccident. Hardly three months had passed, when a chance disclosure\r\nexposed the life she had led before her marriage. But one alternative\r\nwas left to her husband\xe2\x80\x94the alternative of instantly separating from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe effect of the discovery on the unhappy boy\xe2\x80\x94for a boy in\r\ndisposition he still was\xe2\x80\x94may be judged by the event which followed the\r\nexposure. One of Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s superior officers\xe2\x80\x94a certain Major Kirke, if I\r\nremember right\xe2\x80\x94found him in his quarters, writing to his father a\r\nconfession of the disgraceful truth, with a loaded pistol by his side.\r\nThat officer saved the lad\xe2\x80\x99s life from his own hand, and hushed up the\r\nscandalous affair by a compromise. The marriage being a perfectly legal\r\none, and the wife\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct prior to the ceremony giving her husband\r\nno claim to his release from her by divorce, it was only possible to\r\nappeal to her sense of her own interests. A handsome annual allowance\r\nwas secured to her, on condition that she returned to the place from\r\nwhich she had come; that she never appeared in England; and that she\r\nceased to use her husband\xe2\x80\x99s name. Other stipulations were added to\r\nthese. She accepted them all; and measures were privately taken to have\r\nher well looked after in the place of her retreat. What life she led\r\nthere, and whether she performed all the conditions imposed on her, I\r\ncannot say. I can only tell you that she never, to my knowledge, came\r\nto England; that she never annoyed Mr. Vanstone; and that the annual\r\nallowance was paid her, through a local agent in America, to the day of\r\nher death. All that she wanted in marrying him was money; and money she\r\ngot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, Andrew had left the regiment. Nothing would induce\r\nhim to face his brother-officers after what had happened. He sold out\r\nand returned to England. The first intelligence which reached him on\r\nhis return was the intelligence of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death. He came to my\r\noffice in London, before going home, and there learned from my lips how\r\nthe family quarrel had ended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe will which Mr. Vanstone the elder had destroyed in my presence had\r\nnot been, so far as I know, replaced by another. When I was sent for,\r\nin the usual course, on his death, I fully expected that the law would\r\nbe left to make the customary division among his widow and his\r\nchildren. To my surprise, a will appeared among his papers, correctly\r\ndrawn and executed, and dated about a week after the period when the\r\nfirst will had been destroyed. He had maintained his vindictive purpose\r\nagainst his eldest son, and had applied to a stranger for the\r\nprofessional assistance which I honestly believe he was ashamed to ask\r\nfor at my hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is needless to trouble you with the provisions of the will in\r\ndetail. There were the widow and three surviving children to be\r\nprovided for. The widow received a life-interest only in a portion of\r\nthe testator\xe2\x80\x99s property. The remaining portion was divided between\r\nAndrew and Selina\xe2\x80\x94two-thirds to the brother; one-third to the sister.\r\nOn the mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, the money from which her income had been derived\r\nwas to go to Andrew and Selina, in the same relative proportions as\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94five thousand pounds having been first deducted from the sum and\r\npaid to Michael, as the sole legacy left by the implacable father to\r\nhis eldest son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking in round numbers, the division of property, as settled by the\r\nwill, stood thus. Before the mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, Andrew had seventy\r\nthousand pounds; Selina had thirty-five thousand pounds; Michael\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nnothing. After the mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, Michael had five thousand pounds, to\r\nset against Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance augmented to one hundred thousand, and\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance increased to fifty thousand.\xe2\x80\x94Do not suppose that I\r\nam dwelling unnecessarily on this part of the subject. Every word I now\r\nspeak bears on interests still in suspense, which vitally concern Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters. As we get on from past to present, keep in mind\r\nthe terrible inequality of Michael\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance and Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninheritance. The harm done by that vindictive will is, I greatly fear,\r\nnot over yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse, when he heard the news which I had to tell\r\nhim, was worthy of the open, generous nature of the man. He at once\r\nproposed to divide his inheritance with his elder brother. But there\r\nwas one serious obstacle in the way. A letter from Michael was waiting\r\nfor him at my office when he came there, and that letter charged him\r\nwith being the original cause of estrangement between his father and\r\nhis elder brother. The efforts which he had made\xe2\x80\x94bluntly and\r\nincautiously, I own, but with the purest and kindest intentions, as I\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94to compose the quarrel before leaving home, were perverted, by the\r\nvilest misconstruction, to support an accusation of treachery and\r\nfalsehood which would have stung any man to the quick. Andrew felt,\r\nwhat I felt, that if these imputations were not withdrawn before his\r\ngenerous intentions toward his brother took effect, the mere fact of\r\ntheir execution would amount to a practical acknowledgment of the\r\njustice of Michael\xe2\x80\x99s charge against him. He wrote to his brother in the\r\nmost forbearing terms. The answer received was as offensive as words\r\ncould make it. Michael had inherited his father\xe2\x80\x99s temper, unredeemed by\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s better qualities: his second letter reiterated the charges\r\ncontained in the first, and declared that he would only accept the\r\noffered division as an act of atonement and restitution on Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart. I next wrote to the mother to use her influence. She was herself\r\naggrieved at being left with nothing more than a life interest in her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s property; she sided resolutely with Michael; and she\r\nstigmatized Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s proposal as an attempt to bribe her eldest son\r\ninto withdrawing a charge against his brother which that brother knew\r\nto be true. After this last repulse, nothing more could be done.\r\nMichael withdrew to the Continent; and his mother followed him there.\r\nShe lived long enough, and saved money enough out of her income, to add\r\nconsiderably, at her death, to her elder son\xe2\x80\x99s five thousand pounds. He\r\nhad previously still further improved his pecuniary position by an\r\nadvantageous marriage; and he is now passing the close of his days\r\neither in France or Switzerland\xe2\x80\x94a widower, with one son. We shall\r\nreturn to him shortly. In the meantime, I need only tell you that\r\nAndrew and Michael never again met\xe2\x80\x94never again communicated, even by\r\nwriting. To all intents and purposes they were dead to each other, from\r\nthose early days to the present time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can now estimate what Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s position was when he left his\r\nprofession and returned to England. Possessed of a fortune, he was\r\nalone in the world; his future destroyed at the fair outset of life;\r\nhis mother and brother estranged from him; his sister lately married,\r\nwith interests and hopes in which he had no share. Men of firmer mental\r\ncaliber might have found refuge from such a situation as this in an\r\nabsorbing intellectual pursuit. He was not capable of the effort; all\r\nthe strength of his character lay in the affections he had wasted. His\r\nplace in the world was that quiet place at home, with wife and children\r\nto make his life happy, which he had lost forever. To look back was\r\nmore than he dare. To look forward was more than he could. In sheer\r\ndespair, he let his own impetuous youth drive him on; and cast himself\r\ninto the lowest dissipations of a London life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s falsehood had driven him to his ruin. A woman\xe2\x80\x99s love saved\r\nhim at the outset of his downward career. Let us not speak of her\r\nharshly\xe2\x80\x94for we laid her with him yesterday in the grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, who only knew Mrs. Vanstone in later life, when illness and\r\nsorrow and secret care had altered and saddened her, can form no\r\nadequate idea of her attractions of person and character when she was a\r\ngirl of seventeen. I was with Andrew when he first met her. I had tried\r\nto rescue him, for one night at least, from degrading associates and\r\ndegrading pleasures, by persuading him to go with me to a ball given by\r\none of the great City Companies. There they met. She produced a strong\r\nimpression on him the moment he saw her. To me, as to him, she was a\r\ntotal stranger. An introduction to her, obtained in the customary\r\nmanner, informed him that she was the daughter of one Mr. Blake. The\r\nrest he discovered from herself. They were partners in the dance\r\n(unobserved in that crowded ball-room) all through the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCircumstances were against her from the first. She was unhappy at\r\nhome. Her family and friends occupied no recognized station in life:\r\nthey were mean, underhand people, in every way unworthy of her. It was\r\nher first ball\xe2\x80\x94it was the first time she had ever met with a man who\r\nhad the breeding, the manners and the conversation of a gentleman. Are\r\nthese excuses for her, which I have no right to make? If we have any\r\nhuman feeling for human weakness, surely not!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe meeting of that night decided their future. When other meetings\r\nhad followed, when the confession of her love had escaped her, he took\r\nthe one course of all others (took it innocently and unconsciously),\r\nwhich was most dangerous to them both. His frankness and his sense of\r\nhonor forbade him to deceive her: he opened his heart and told her the\r\ntruth. She was a generous, impulsive girl; she had no home ties strong\r\nenough to plead with her; she was passionately fond of him\xe2\x80\x94and he had\r\nmade that appeal to her pity which, to the eternal honor of women, is\r\nthe hardest of all appeals for them to resist. She saw, and saw truly,\r\nthat she alone stood between him and his ruin. The last chance of his\r\nrescue hung on her decision. She decided; and saved him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me not be misunderstood; let me not be accused of trifling with\r\nthe serious social question on which my narrative forces me to touch. I\r\nwill defend her memory by no false reasoning\xe2\x80\x94I will only speak the\r\ntruth. It is the truth that she snatched him from mad excesses which\r\nmust have ended in his early death. It is the truth that she restored\r\nhim to that happy home existence which you remember so tenderly\xe2\x80\x94which\r\n_he_ remembered so gratefully that, on the day when he was free, he\r\nmade her his wife. Let strict morality claim its right, and condemn her\r\nearly fault. I have read my New Testament to little purpose, indeed, if\r\nChristian mercy may not soften the hard sentence against her\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nChristian charity may not find a plea for her memory in the love and\r\nfidelity, the suffering and the sacrifice, of her whole life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few words more will bring us to a later time, and to events which\r\nhave happened within your own experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not remind you that the position in which Mr. Vanstone was now\r\nplaced could lead in the end to but one result\xe2\x80\x94to a disclosure, more or\r\nless inevitable, of the truth. Attempts were made to keep the hopeless\r\nmisfortune of his life a secret from Miss Blake\xe2\x80\x99s family; and, as a\r\nmatter of course, those attempts failed before the relentless scrutiny\r\nof her father and her friends. What might have happened if her\r\nrelatives had been what is termed \xe2\x80\x98respectable\xe2\x80\x99 I cannot pretend to\r\nsay. As it was, they were people who could (in the common phrase) be\r\nconveniently treated with. The only survivor of the family at the\r\npresent time is a scoundrel calling himself Captain Wragge. When I tell\r\nyou that he privately extorted the price of his silence from Mrs.\r\nVanstone to the last; and when I add that his conduct presents no\r\nextraordinary exception to the conduct, in their lifetime, of the other\r\nrelatives\xe2\x80\x94you will understand what sort of people I had to deal with in\r\nmy client\xe2\x80\x99s interests, and how their assumed indignation was appeased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving, in the first instance, left England for Ireland, Mr. Vanstone\r\nand Miss Blake remained there afterward for some years. Girl as she\r\nwas, she faced her position and its necessities without flinching.\r\nHaving once resolved to sacrifice her life to the man she loved; having\r\nquieted her conscience by persuading herself that his marriage was a\r\nlegal mockery, and that she was \xe2\x80\x98his wife in the sight of Heaven,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nset herself from the first to accomplish the one foremost purpose of so\r\nliving with him, in the world\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as never to raise the suspicion\r\nthat she was not his lawful wife. The women are few, indeed, who cannot\r\nresolve firmly, scheme patiently, and act promptly where the dearest\r\ninterests of their lives are concerned. Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94she has a right\r\nnow, remember, to that name\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Vanstone had more than the average\r\nshare of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tenacity and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tact; and she took all the\r\nneedful precautions, in those early days, which her husband\xe2\x80\x99s less\r\nready capacity had not the art to devise\xe2\x80\x94precautions to which they were\r\nlargely indebted for the preservation of their secret in later times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to these safeguards, not a shadow of suspicion followed them\r\nwhen they returned to England. They first settled in Devonshire, merely\r\nbecause they were far removed there from that northern county in which\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s family and connections had been known. On the part of\r\nhis surviving relatives, they had no curious investigations to dread.\r\nHe was totally estranged from his mother and his elder brother. His\r\nmarried sister had been forbidden by her husband (who was a clergyman)\r\nto hold any communication with him, from the period when he had fallen\r\ninto the deplorable way of life which I have described as following his\r\nreturn from Canada. Other relations he had none. When he and Miss Blake\r\nleft Devonshire, their next change of residence was to this house.\r\nNeither courting nor avoiding notice; simply happy in themselves, in\r\ntheir children, and in their quiet rural life; unsuspected by the few\r\nneighbors who formed their modest circle of acquaintance to be other\r\nthan what they seemed\xe2\x80\x94the truth in their case, as in the cases of many\r\nothers, remained undiscovered until accident forced it into the light\r\nof day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf, in your close intimacy with them, it seems strange that they\r\nshould never have betrayed themselves, let me ask you to consider the\r\ncircumstances and you will understand the apparent anomaly. Remember\r\nthat they had been living as husband and wife, to all intents and\r\npurposes (except that the marriage-service had not been read over\r\nthem), for fifteen years before you came into the house; and bear in\r\nmind, at the same time, that no event occurred to disturb Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s happiness in the present, to remind him of the past, or to\r\nwarn him of the future, until the announcement of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nreached him, in that letter from America which you saw placed in his\r\nhand. From that day forth\xe2\x80\x94when a past which _he_ abhorred was forced\r\nback to his memory; when a future which _she_ had never dared to\r\nanticipate was placed within her reach\xe2\x80\x94you will soon perceive, if you\r\nhave not perceived already, that they both betrayed themselves, time\r\nafter time; and that your innocence of all suspicion, and their\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s innocence of all suspicion, alone prevented you from\r\ndiscovering the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sad story of the past is now as well known to you as to me. I have\r\nhad hard words to speak. God knows I have spoken them with true\r\nsympathy for the living, with true tenderness for the memory of the\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, turned his face a little away, and rested his head on his\r\nhand, in the quiet, undemonstrative manner which was natural to him.\r\nThus far, Miss Garth had only interrupted his narrative by an\r\noccasional word or by a mute token of her attention. She made no effort\r\nto conceal her tears; they fell fast and silently over her wasted\r\ncheeks, as she looked up and spoke to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done you some\r\ninjury, sir, in my thoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a noble simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow you better now. Let me ask your forgiveness; let me take your\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words, and the action which accompanied them, touched him deeply.\r\nHe took her hand in silence. She was the first to speak, the first to\r\nset the example of self-control. It is one of the noble instincts of\r\nwomen that nothing more powerfully rouses them to struggle with their\r\nown sorrow than the sight of a man\xe2\x80\x99s distress. She quietly dried her\r\ntears; she quietly drew her chair round the table, so as to sit nearer\r\nto him when she spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been sadly broken, Mr. Pendril, by what has happened in this\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cor I should have borne what you have told me better\r\nthan I have borne it to-day. Will you let me ask one question before\r\nyou go on? My heart aches for the children of my love\xe2\x80\x94more than ever my\r\nchildren now. Is there no hope for their future? Are they left with no\r\nprospect but poverty before them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer hesitated before he answered the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are left dependent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at last, \xe2\x80\x9con the justice and the\r\nmercy of a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the misfortune of their birth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the misfortunes which have followed the marriage of their\r\nparents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that startling answer he rose, took up the will from the floor,\r\nand restored it to its former position on the table between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only place the truth before you,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cin one plain form\r\nof words. The marriage has destroyed this will, and has left Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters dependent on their uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the breeze stirred again among the shrubs under the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn their uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Miss Garth. She considered for a moment, and\r\nlaid her hand suddenly on Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cNot on Michael Vanstone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: on Michael Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s hand still mechanically grasped the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s arm. Her\r\nwhole mind was absorbed in the effort to realize the discovery which\r\nhad now burst on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDependent on Michael Vanstone!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cDependent on\r\ntheir father\xe2\x80\x99s bitterest enemy? How can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your attention for a few minutes more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pendril, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou shall hear. The sooner we can bring this painful interview to a\r\nclose, the sooner I can open communications with Mr. Michael Vanstone,\r\nand the sooner you will know what he decides on doing for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norphan daughters. I repeat to you that they are absolutely dependent on\r\nhim. You will most readily understand how and why, if we take up the\r\nchain of events where we last left it\xe2\x80\x94at the period of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cWere you in the secret of that\r\nmarriage at the time when it took place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappily, I was not. I was away from London\xe2\x80\x94away from England at the\r\ntime. If Mr. Vanstone had been able to communicate with me when the\r\nletter from America announced the death of his wife, the fortunes of\r\nhis daughters would not have been now at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and, before proceeding further, looked once more at the\r\nletters which he had consulted at an earlier period of the interview.\r\nHe took one letter from the rest, and put it on the table by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning of the present year,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9ca very serious\r\nbusiness necessity, in connection with some West Indian property\r\npossessed by an old client and friend of mine, required the presence\r\neither of myself, or of one of my two partners, in Jamaica. One of the\r\ntwo could not be spared; the other was not in health to undertake the\r\nvoyage. There was no choice left but for me to go. I wrote to Mr.\r\nVanstone, telling him that I should leave England at the end of\r\nFebruary, and that the nature of the business which took me away\r\nafforded little hope of my getting back from the West Indies before\r\nJune. My letter was not written with any special motive. I merely\r\nthought it right\xe2\x80\x94seeing that my partners were not admitted to my\r\nknowledge of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s private affairs\xe2\x80\x94to warn him of my absence,\r\nas a measure of formal precaution which it was right to take. At the\r\nend of February I left England, without having heard from him. I was on\r\nthe sea when the news of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death reached him, on the fourth of\r\nMarch: and I did not return until the middle of last June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou warned him of your departure,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you not\r\nwarn him of your return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot personally. My head-clerk sent him one of the circulars which were\r\ndispatched from my office, in various directions, to announce my\r\nreturn. It was the first substitute I thought of for the personal\r\nletter which the pressure of innumerable occupations, all crowding on\r\nme together after my long absence, did not allow me leisure to write.\r\nBarely a month later, the first information of his marriage reached me\r\nin a letter from himself, written on the day of the fatal accident. The\r\ncircumstances which induced him to write arose out of an event in which\r\nyou must have taken some interest\xe2\x80\x94I mean the attachment between Mr.\r\nClare\xe2\x80\x99s son and Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s youngest daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say that I was favorably disposed toward that attachment at\r\nthe time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cI was ignorant then of the family\r\nsecret: I know better now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. The motive which you can now appreciate is the motive that\r\nleads us to the point. The young lady herself (as I have heard from the\r\nelder Mr. Clare, to whom I am indebted for my knowledge of the\r\ncircumstances in detail) confessed her attachment to her father, and\r\ninnocently touched him to the quick by a chance reference to his own\r\nearly life. He had a long conversation with Mrs. Vanstone, at which\r\nthey both agreed that Mr. Clare must be privately informed of the\r\ntruth, before the attachment between the two young people was allowed\r\nto proceed further. It was painful in the last degree, both to husband\r\nand wife, to be reduced to this alternative. But they were resolute,\r\nhonorably resolute, in making the sacrifice of their own feelings; and\r\nMr. Vanstone betook himself on the spot to Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\xe2\x80\x94You no\r\ndoubt observed a remarkable change in Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s manner on that\r\nday; and you can now account for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth bowed her head, and Mr. Pendril went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for all\r\nsocial prejudices,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cto anticipate his reception of the\r\nconfession which his neighbor addressed to him. Five minutes after the\r\ninterview had begun, the two old friends were as easy and unrestrained\r\ntogether as usual. In the course of conversation, Mr. Vanstone\r\nmentioned the pecuniary arrangement which he had made for the benefit\r\nof his daughter and of her future husband\xe2\x80\x94and, in doing so, he\r\nnaturally referred to his will here, on the table between us. Mr.\r\nClare, remembering that his friend had been married in the March of\r\nthat year, at once asked when the will had been executed: receiving the\r\nreply that it had been made five years since; and, thereupon, astounded\r\nMr. Vanstone by telling him bluntly that the document was waste paper\r\nin the eye of the law. Up to that moment he, like many other persons,\r\nhad been absolutely ignorant that a man\xe2\x80\x99s marriage is, legally as well\r\nas socially, considered to be the most important event in his life;\r\nthat it destroys the validity of any will which he may have made as a\r\nsingle man; and that it renders absolutely necessary the entire\r\nre-assertion of his testamentary intentions in the character of a\r\nhusband. The statement of this plain fact appeared to overwhelm Mr.\r\nVanstone. Declaring that his friend had laid him under an obligation\r\nwhich he should remember to his dying day, he at once left the cottage,\r\nat once returned home, and wrote me this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed the letter open to Miss Garth. In tearless, speechless grief,\r\nshe read these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR PENDRIL\xe2\x80\x94Since we last wrote to each other an extraordinary\r\nchange has taken place in my life. About a week after you went away, I\r\nreceived news from America which told me that I was free. Need I say\r\nwhat use I made of that freedom? Need I say that the mother of my\r\nchildren is now my Wife?\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are surprised at not having heard from me the moment you\r\n    got back, attribute my silence, in great part\xe2\x80\x94if not altogether\xe2\x80\x94to\r\n    my own total ignorance of the legal necessity for making another\r\n    will. Not half an hour since, I was enlightened for the first time\r\n    (under circumstances which I will mention when me meet) by my old\r\n    friend, Mr. Clare. Family anxieties have had something to do with\r\n    my silence as well. My wife\xe2\x80\x99s confinement is close at hand; and,\r\n    besides this serious anxiety, my second daughter is just engaged to\r\n    be married. Until I saw Mr. Clare to-day, these matters so filled\r\n    my mind that I never thought of writing to you during the one short\r\n    month which is all that has passed since I got news of your return.\r\n    Now I know that my will must be made again, I write instantly. For\r\n    God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, come on the day when you receive this\xe2\x80\x94come and relieve\r\n    me from the dreadful thought that my two darling girls are at this\r\n    moment unprovided for. If anything happened to me, and if my desire\r\n    to do their mother justice, ended (through my miserable ignorance\r\n    of the law) in leaving Norah and Magdalen disinherited, I should\r\n    not rest in my grave! Come at any cost, to yours ever,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA. V.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the Saturday morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pendril resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthose lines reached\r\nme. I instantly set aside all other business, and drove to the railway.\r\nAt the London terminus, I heard the first news of the Friday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccident; heard it, with conflicting accounts of the numbers and names\r\nof the passengers killed. At Bristol, they were better informed; and\r\nthe dreadful truth about Mr. Vanstone was confirmed. I had time to\r\nrecover myself before I reached your station here, and found Mr.\r\nClare\xe2\x80\x99s son waiting for me. He took me to his father\xe2\x80\x99s cottage; and\r\nthere, without losing a moment, I drew out Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s will. My\r\nobject was to secure the only provision for her daughters which it was\r\nnow possible to make. Mr. Vanstone having died intestate, a third of\r\nhis fortune would go to his widow; and the rest would be divided among\r\nhis next of kin. As children born out of wedlock, Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughters, under the circumstances of their father\xe2\x80\x99s death, had no more\r\nclaim to a share in his property than the daughters of one of his\r\nlaborers in the village. The one chance left was that their mother\r\nmight sufficiently recover to leave her third share to them, by will,\r\nin the event of her decease. Now you know why I wrote to you to ask for\r\nthat interview\xe2\x80\x94why I waited day and night, in the hope of receiving a\r\nsummons to the house. I was sincerely sorry to send back such an answer\r\nto your note of inquiry as I was compelled to write. But while there\r\nwas a chance of the preservation of Mrs. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s life, the secret of\r\nthe marriage was hers, not mine; and every consideration of delicacy\r\nforbade me to disclose it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth; \xe2\x80\x9cI understand your motives, and\r\nrespect them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy last attempt to provide for the daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Pendril,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwas, as you know, rendered unavailing by the dangerous nature of Mrs.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s illness. Her death left the infant who survived her by a few\r\nhours (the infant born, you will remember, in lawful wedlock)\r\npossessed, in due legal course, of the whole of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s fortune.\r\nOn the child\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94if it had only outlived the mother by a few\r\nseconds, instead of a few hours, the result would have been the\r\nsame\xe2\x80\x94the next of kin to the legitimate offspring took the money; and\r\nthat next of kin is the infant\xe2\x80\x99s paternal uncle, Michael Vanstone. The\r\nwhole fortune of eighty thousand pounds has virtually passed into his\r\npossession already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there no other relations?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there no hope\r\nfrom any one else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no other relations with Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s claim,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no grandfathers or grandmothers of the dead child\r\n(on the side of either of the parents) now alive. It was not likely\r\nthere should be, considering the ages of Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone when\r\nthey died. But it is a misfortune to be reasonably lamented that no\r\nother uncles or aunts survive. There are cousins alive; a son and two\r\ndaughters of that elder sister of Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s, who married\r\nArchdeacon Bartram, and who died, as I told you, some years since. But\r\ntheir interest is superseded by the interest of the nearer blood. No,\r\nMiss Garth, we must look facts as they are resolutely in the face. Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters are Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s Children; and the law leaves them\r\nhelpless at their uncle\xe2\x80\x99s mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cruel law, Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x94a cruel law in a Christian country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCruel as it is, Miss Garth, it stands excused by a shocking\r\npeculiarity in this case. I am far from defending the law of England as\r\nit affects illegitimate offspring. On the contrary, I think it a\r\ndisgrace to the nation. It visits the sins of the parents on the\r\nchildren; it encourages vice by depriving fathers and mothers of the\r\nstrongest of all motives for making the atonement of marriage; and it\r\nclaims to produce these two abominable results in the names of morality\r\nand religion. But it has no extraordinary oppression to answer for in\r\nthe case of these unhappy girls. The more merciful and Christian law of\r\nother countries, which allows the marriage of the parents to make the\r\nchildren legitimate, has no mercy on _these_ children. The accident of\r\ntheir father having been married, when he first met with their mother,\r\nhas made them the outcasts of the whole social community; it has placed\r\nthem out of the pale of the Civil Law of Europe. I tell you the hard\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94it is useless to disguise it. There is no hope, if we look back\r\nat the past: there may be hope, if we look on to the future. The best\r\nservice which I can now render you is to shorten the period of your\r\nsuspense. In less than an hour I shall be on my way back to London.\r\nImmediately on my arrival, I will ascertain the speediest means of\r\ncommunicating with Mr. Michael Vanstone; and will let you know the\r\nresult. Sad as the position of the two sisters now is, we must look at\r\nit on its best side; we must not lose hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Miss Garth. \xe2\x80\x9cHope from Michael Vanstone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; hope from the influence on him of time, if not from the influence\r\nof mercy. As I have already told you, he is now an old man; he cannot,\r\nin the course of nature, expect to live much longer. If he looks back\r\nto the period when he and his brother were first at variance, he must\r\nlook back through thirty years. Surely, these are softening influences\r\nwhich must affect any man? Surely, his own knowledge of the shocking\r\ncircumstances under which he has become possessed of this money will\r\nplead with him, if nothing else does?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try to think as you do, Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x94I will try to hope for the\r\nbest. Shall we be left long in suspense before the decision reaches\r\nus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust not. The only delay on my side will be caused by the necessity\r\nof discovering the place of Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s residence on the\r\nContinent. I think I have the means of meeting this difficulty\r\nsuccessfully; and the moment I reach London, those means shall be\r\ntried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up his hat; and then returned to the table on which the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s last letter, and the father\xe2\x80\x99s useless will, were lying side by\r\nside. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, he placed them both in Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may help you in breaking the hard truth to the orphan sisters,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, in his quiet, self-repressed way, \xe2\x80\x9cif they can see how their\r\nfather refers to them in his will\xe2\x80\x94if they can read his letter to me,\r\nthe last he ever wrote. Let these tokens tell them that the one idea of\r\ntheir father\xe2\x80\x99s life was the idea of making atonement to his children.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They may think bitterly of their birth,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to me, at the time\r\nwhen I drew this useless will; \xe2\x80\x98but they shall never think bitterly of\r\nme. I will cross them in nothing: they shall never know a sorrow that I\r\ncan spare them, or a want which I will not satisfy.\xe2\x80\x99 He made me put\r\nthose words in his will, to plead for him when the truth which he had\r\nconcealed from his children in his lifetime was revealed to them after\r\nhis death. No law can deprive his daughters of the legacy of his\r\nrepentance and his love. I leave the will and the letter to help you: I\r\ngive them both into your care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw how his parting kindness touched her and thoughtfully hastened\r\nthe farewell. She took his hand in both her own and murmured a few\r\nbroken words of gratitude. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust me to do my best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nturning away with a merciful abruptness, left her. In the broad,\r\ncheerful sunshine he had come in to reveal the fatal truth. In the\r\nbroad, cheerful sunshine\xe2\x80\x94that truth disclosed\xe2\x80\x94he went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly an hour past noon when Mr. Pendril left the house. Miss\r\nGarth sat down again at the table alone, and tried to face the\r\nnecessity which the event of the morning now forced on her.\r\n\r\nHer mind was not equal to the effort. She tried to lessen the strain on\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94to lose the sense of her own position\xe2\x80\x94to escape from her thoughts\r\nfor a few minutes only. After a little, she opened Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, and mechanically set herself to read it through once more.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the last words of the dead man fastened themselves more and\r\nmore firmly on her attention. The unrelieved solitude, the unbroken\r\nsilence, helped their influence on her mind and opened it to those very\r\nimpressions of past and present which she was most anxious to shun. As\r\nshe reached the melancholy lines which closed the letter, she found\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94insensibly, almost unconsciously, at first\xe2\x80\x94tracing the fatal\r\nchain of events, link by link backward, until she reached its beginning\r\nin the contemplated marriage between Magdalen and Francis Clare.\r\n\r\nThat marriage had taken Mr. Vanstone to his old friend, with the\r\nconfession on his lips which would otherwise never have escaped them.\r\nThence came the discovery which had sent him home to summon the lawyer\r\nto the house. That summons, again, had produced the inevitable\r\nacceleration of the Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s journey to Friday; the Friday of the\r\nfatal accident, the Friday when he went to his death. From his death\r\nfollowed the second bereavement which had made the house desolate; the\r\nhelpless position of the daughters whose prosperous future had been his\r\ndearest care; the revelation of the secret which had overwhelmed her\r\nthat morning; the disclosure, more terrible still, which she now stood\r\ncommitted to make to the orphan sisters. For the first time she saw the\r\nwhole sequence of events\xe2\x80\x94saw it as plainly as the cloudless blue of the\r\nsky and the green glow of the trees in the sunlight outside.\r\n\r\nHow\xe2\x80\x94when could she tell them? Who could approach them with the\r\ndisclosure of their own illegitimacy before their father and mother had\r\nbeen dead a week? Who could speak the dreadful words, while the first\r\ntears were wet on their cheeks, while the first pang of separation was\r\nat its keenest in their hearts, while the memory of the funeral was not\r\na day old yet? Not their last friend left; not the faithful woman whose\r\nheart bled for them. No! silence for the present time, at all\r\nrisks\xe2\x80\x94merciful silence, for many days to come!\r\n\r\nShe left the room, with the will and the letter in her hand\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\nnatural, human pity at her heart which sealed her lips and shut her\r\neyes resolutely to the future. In the hall she stopped and listened.\r\nNot a sound was audible. She softly ascended the stairs, on her way to\r\nher own room, and passed the door of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s bed-chamber. Voices\r\ninside, the voices of the two sisters, caught her ear. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsideration, she checked herself, turned back, and quickly descended\r\nthe stairs again. Both Norah and Magdalen knew of the interview between\r\nMr. Pendril and herself; she had felt it her duty to show them his\r\nletter making the appointment. Could she excite their suspicion by\r\nlocking herself up from them in her room as soon as the lawyer had left\r\nthe house? Her hand trembled on the banister; she felt that her face\r\nmight betray her. The self-forgetful fortitude, which had never failed\r\nher until that day, had been tried once too often\xe2\x80\x94had been tasked\r\nbeyond its powers at last.\r\n\r\nAt the hall door she reflected for a moment again, and went into the\r\ngarden; directing her steps to a rustic bench and table placed out of\r\nsight of the house among the trees. In past times she had often sat\r\nthere, with Mrs. Vanstone on one side, with Norah on the other, with\r\nMagdalen and the dogs romping on the grass. Alone she sat there now\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nwill and the letter which she dared not trust out of her own\r\npossession, laid on the table\xe2\x80\x94her head bowed over them; her face hidden\r\nin her hands. Alone she sat there and tried to rouse her sinking\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nDoubts thronged on her of the dark days to come; dread beset her of the\r\nhidden danger which her own silence toward Norah and Magdalen might\r\nstore up in the near future. The accident of a moment might suddenly\r\nreveal the truth. Mr. Pendril might write, might personally address\r\nhimself to the sisters, in the natural conviction that she had\r\nenlightened them. Complications might gather round them at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotice; unforeseen necessities might arise for immediately leaving the\r\nhouse. She saw all these perils\xe2\x80\x94and still the cruel courage to face the\r\nworst, and speak, was as far from her as ever. Ere long the thickening\r\nconflict of her thoughts forced its way outward for relief, in words\r\nand actions. She raised her head and beat her hand helplessly on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help me, what am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to tell them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to tell them,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice behind her. \xe2\x80\x9cThey know it\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet and looked round. It was Magdalen who stood\r\nbefore her\xe2\x80\x94Magdalen who had spoken those words.\r\n\r\nYes, there was the graceful figure, in its mourning garments, standing\r\nout tall and black and motionless against the leafy background. There\r\nwas Magdalen herself, with a changeless stillness on her white face;\r\nwith an icy resignation in her steady gray eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know it already,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, in clear, measured tones. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters are Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s Children; and the law leaves them\r\nhelpless at their uncle\xe2\x80\x99s mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, without a tear on her cheeks, without a faltering tone in her\r\nvoice, she repeated the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s own words, exactly as he had spoken\r\nthem. Miss Garth staggered back a step and caught at the bench to\r\nsupport herself. Her head swam; she closed her eyes in a momentary\r\nfaintness. When they opened again, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s arm was supporting her,\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s breath fanned her cheek, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s cold lips kissed her.\r\nShe drew back from the kiss; the touch of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s lips thrilled her\r\nwith terror.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she could speak she put the inevitable question. \xe2\x80\x9cYou heard\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the open window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom beginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had listened\xe2\x80\x94this girl of eighteen, in the first week of her\r\norphanage, had listened to the whole terrible revelation, word by word,\r\nas it fell from the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s lips; and had never once betrayed herself!\r\nFrom first to last, the only movements which had escaped her had been\r\nmovements guarded enough and slight enough to be mistaken for the\r\npassage of the summer breeze through the leaves!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to speak yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in softer and gentler tones. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook at me with those doubting eyes. What wrong have I done? When Mr.\r\nPendril wished to speak to you about Norah and me, his letter gave us\r\nour choice to be present at the interview, or to keep away. If my elder\r\nsister decided to keep away, how could I come? How could I hear my own\r\nstory except as I did? My listening has done no harm. It has done\r\ngood\xe2\x80\x94it has saved you the distress of speaking to us. You have suffered\r\nenough for us already; it is time we learned to suffer for ourselves. I\r\nhave learned. And Norah is learning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have done all I could to spare you. I have told Norah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had told Norah! Was this girl, whose courage had faced the terrible\r\nnecessity from which a woman old enough to be her mother had recoiled,\r\nthe girl Miss Garth had brought up? the girl whose nature she had\r\nbelieved to be as well known to her as her own?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, passionately, \xe2\x80\x9cyou frighten me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen only sighed, and turned wearily away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry not to think worse of me than I deserve,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t cry.\r\nMy heart is numbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved away slowly over the grass. Miss Garth watched the tall black\r\nfigure gliding away alone until it was lost among the trees. While it\r\nwas in sight she could think of nothing else. The moment it was gone,\r\nshe thought of Norah. For the first time in her experience of the\r\nsisters her heart led her instinctively to the elder of the two.\r\n\r\nNorah was still in her own room. She was sitting on the couch by the\r\nwindow, with her mother\xe2\x80\x99s old music-book\xe2\x80\x94the keepsake which Mrs.\r\nVanstone had found in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s study on the day of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94spread open on her lap. She looked up from it with such quiet\r\nsorrow, and pointed with such ready kindness to the vacant place at her\r\nside, that Miss Garth doubted for the moment whether Magdalen had\r\nspoken the truth. \xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah, simply, turning to the first leaf\r\nin the music-book\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s name written in it, and some verses to\r\nmy father on the next page. We may keep this for ourselves, if we keep\r\nnothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d She put her arm round Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and a faint\r\ntinge of color stole over her cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI see anxious thoughts in your\r\nface,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you anxious about me? Are you doubting\r\nwhether I have heard it? I have heard the whole truth. I might have\r\nfelt it bitterly, later; it is too soon to feel it now. You have seen\r\nMagdalen? She went out to find you\xe2\x80\x94where did you leave her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to her; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at her.\r\nMagdalen has frightened me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah rose hurriedly; rose, startled and distressed by Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think ill of Magdalen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen suffers in secret\r\nmore than I do. Try not to grieve over what you have heard about us\r\nthis morning. Does it matter who we are, or what we keep or lose? What\r\nloss is there for us after the loss of our father and mother? Oh, Miss\r\nGarth, _there_ is the only bitterness! What did we remember of them\r\nwhen we laid them in the grave yesterday? Nothing but the love they\r\ngave us\xe2\x80\x94the love we must never hope for again. What else can we\r\nremember to-day? What change can the world, and the world\xe2\x80\x99s cruel laws\r\nmake in _our_ memory of the kindest father, the kindest mother, that\r\nchildren ever had!\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped: struggled with her rising grief; and\r\nquietly, resolutely, kept it down. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you wait here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhile I go and bring Magdalen back? Magdalen was always your favorite:\r\nI want her to be your favorite still.\xe2\x80\x9d She laid the music-book gently\r\non Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s lap\xe2\x80\x94and left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen was always your favorite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTenderly as they had been spoken, those words fell reproachfully on\r\nMiss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s ear. For the first time in the long companionship of her\r\npupils and herself a doubt whether she, and all those about her, had\r\nnot been fatally mistaken in their relative estimate of the sisters,\r\nnow forced itself on her mind.\r\n\r\nShe had studied the natures of her two pupils in the daily intimacy of\r\ntwelve years. Those natures, which she believed herself to have sounded\r\nthrough all their depths, had been suddenly tried in the sharp ordeal\r\nof affliction. How had they come out from the test? As her previous\r\nexperience had prepared her to see them? No: in flat contradiction to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhat did such a result as this imply?\r\n\r\nThoughts came to her, as she asked herself that question, which have\r\nstartled and saddened us all.\r\n\r\nDoes there exist in every human being, beneath that outward and visible\r\ncharacter which is shaped into form by the social influences\r\nsurrounding us, an inward, invisible disposition, which is part of\r\nourselves, which education may indirectly modify, but can never hope to\r\nchange? Is the philosophy which denies this and asserts that we are\r\nborn with dispositions like blank sheets of paper a philosophy which\r\nhas failed to remark that we are not born with blank faces\xe2\x80\x94a philosophy\r\nwhich has never compared together two infants of a few days old, and\r\nhas never observed that those infants are not born with blank tempers\r\nfor mothers and nurses to fill up at will? Are there, infinitely\r\nvarying with each individual, inbred forces of Good and Evil in all of\r\nus, deep down below the reach of mortal encouragement and mortal\r\nrepression\xe2\x80\x94hidden Good and hidden Evil, both alike at the mercy of the\r\nliberating opportunity and the sufficient temptation? Within these\r\nearthly limits, is earthly Circumstance ever the key; and can no human\r\nvigilance warn us beforehand of the forces imprisoned in ourselves\r\nwhich that key _may_ unlock?\r\n\r\nFor the first time, thoughts such as these rose darkly\xe2\x80\x94as shadowy and\r\nterrible possibilities\xe2\x80\x94in Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s mind. For the first time, she\r\nassociated those possibilities with the past conduct and characters,\r\nwith the future lives and fortunes of the orphan sisters.\r\n\r\nSearching, as in a glass darkly, into the two natures, she felt her\r\nway, doubt by doubt, from one possible truth to another. It might be\r\nthat the upper surface of their characters was all that she had, thus\r\nfar, plainly seen in Norah and Magdalen. It might be that the\r\nunalluring secrecy and reserve of one sister, the all-attractive\r\nopenness and high spirits of the other, were more or less referable, in\r\neach case, to those physical causes which work toward the production of\r\nmoral results. It might be, that under the surface so formed\xe2\x80\x94a surface\r\nwhich there had been nothing, hitherto, in the happy, prosperous,\r\nuneventful lives of the sisters to disturb\xe2\x80\x94forces of inborn and inbred\r\ndisposition had remained concealed, which the shock of the first\r\nserious calamity in their lives had now thrown up into view. Was this\r\nso? Was the promise of the future shining with prophetic light through\r\nthe surface-shadow of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s reserve, and darkening with prophetic\r\ngloom, under the surface-glitter of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s bright spirits? If the\r\nlife of the elder sister was destined henceforth to be the ripening\r\nground of the undeveloped Good that was in her\xe2\x80\x94was the life of the\r\nyounger doomed to be the battle-field of mortal conflict with the\r\nroused forces of Evil in herself?\r\n\r\nOn the brink of that terrible conclusion, Miss Garth shrank back in\r\ndismay. Her heart was the heart of a true woman. It accepted the\r\nconviction which raised Norah higher in her love: it rejected the doubt\r\nwhich threatened to place Magdalen lower. She rose and paced the room\r\nimpatiently; she recoiled with an angry suddenness from the whole train\r\nof thought in which her mind had been engaged but the moment before.\r\nWhat if there were dangerous elements in the strength of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x94was it not her duty to help the girl against herself? How had\r\nshe performed that duty? She had let herself be governed by first fears\r\nand first impressions; she had never waited to consider whether\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s openly acknowledged action of that morning might not imply a\r\nself-sacrificing fortitude, which promised, in after-life, the noblest\r\nand the most enduring results. She had let Norah go and speak those\r\nwords of tender remonstrance, which she should first have spoken\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9chow long I have lived in the\r\nworld, and how little I have known of my own weakness and wickedness\r\nuntil to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door of the room opened. Norah came in, as she had gone out, alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember leaving anything on the little table by the\r\ngarden-seat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, quietly.\r\n\r\nBefore Miss Garth could answer the question, she held out her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill and her father\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen came back after you went away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand found these\r\nlast relics. She heard Mr. Pendril say they were her legacy and mine.\r\nWhen I went into the garden she was reading the letter. There was no\r\nneed for me to speak to her; our father had spoken to her from his\r\ngrave. See how she has listened to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the letter. The traces of heavy tear-drops lay thick\r\nover the last lines of the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Her_ tears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah, softly.\r\n\r\nMiss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s head drooped low over the mute revelation of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn to her better self.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never doubt her again!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Norah. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are alone now\xe2\x80\x94we have\r\nour hard way through the world to walk on as patiently as we can. If\r\nMagdalen ever falters and turns back, help her for the love of old\r\ntimes; help her against herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart and strength\xe2\x80\x94as God shall judge me, with the\r\ndevotion of my whole life!\xe2\x80\x9d In those fervent words Miss Garth answered.\r\nShe took the hand which Norah held out to her, and put it, in sorrow\r\nand humility, to her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my love, forgive me! I have been\r\nmiserably blind\xe2\x80\x94I have never valued you as I ought!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah gently checked her before she could say more; gently whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me into the garden\xe2\x80\x94come, and help Magdalen to look patiently\r\nto the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe future! Who could see the faintest glimmer of it? Who could see\r\nanything but the ill-omened figure of Michael Vanstone, posted darkly\r\non the verge of the present time\xe2\x80\x94and closing all the prospect that lay\r\nbeyond him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning but one, news was received from Mr. Pendril. The\r\nplace of Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s residence on the Continent had been\r\ndiscovered. He was living at Zurich; and a letter had been dispatched\r\nto him, at that place, on the day when the information was obtained. In\r\nthe course of the coming week an answer might be expected, and the\r\npurport of it should be communicated forthwith to the ladies at\r\nCombe-Raven.\r\n\r\nShort as it was, the interval of delay passed wearily. Ten days elapsed\r\nbefore the expected answer was received; and when it came at last, it\r\nproved to be, strictly speaking, no answer at all. Mr. Pendril had been\r\nmerely referred to an agent in London who was in possession of Michael\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. Certain difficulties had been discovered in\r\nconnection with those instructions, which had produced the necessity of\r\nonce more writing to Zurich. And there \xe2\x80\x9cthe negotiations\xe2\x80\x9d rested again\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nA second paragraph in Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s letter contained another piece of\r\nintelligence entirely new. Mr. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s son (and only child),\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone, had recently arrived in London, and was then staying\r\nin lodgings occupied by his cousin, Mr. George Bartram. Professional\r\nconsiderations had induced Mr. Pendril to pay a visit to the lodgings.\r\nHe had been very kindly received by Mr. Bartram; but had been informed\r\nby that gentleman that his cousin was not then in a condition to\r\nreceive visitors. Mr. Noel Vanstone had been suffering, for some years\r\npast, from a wearing and obstinate malady; he had come to England\r\nexpressly to obtain the best medical advice, and he still felt the\r\nfatigue of the journey so severely as to be confined to his bed. Under\r\nthese circumstances, Mr. Pendril had no alternative but to take his\r\nleave. An interview with Mr. Noel Vanstone might have cleared up some\r\nof the difficulties in connection with his father\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. As\r\nevents had turned out, there was no help for it but to wait for a few\r\ndays more.\r\n\r\nThe days passed, the empty days of solitude and suspense. At last, a\r\nthird letter from the lawyer announced the long delayed conclusion of\r\nthe correspondence. The final answer had been received from Zurich, and\r\nMr. Pendril would personally communicate it at Combe-Raven on the\r\nafternoon of the next day.\r\n\r\nThat next day was Wednesday, the twelfth of August. The weather had\r\nchanged in the night; and the sun rose watery through mist and cloud.\r\nBy noon the sky was overcast at all points; the temperature was\r\nsensibly colder; and the rain poured down, straight and soft and\r\nsteady, on the thirsty earth. Toward three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Miss Garth and\r\nNorah entered the morning-room, to await Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. They\r\nwere joined shortly afterward by Magdalen. In half an hour more the\r\nfamiliar fall of the iron latch in the socket reached their ears from\r\nthe fence beyond the shrubbery. Mr. Pendril and Mr. Clare advanced into\r\nview along the garden-path, walking arm-in-arm through the rain,\r\nsheltered by the same umbrella. The lawyer bowed as they passed the\r\nwindows; Mr. Clare walked straight on, deep in his own\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94noticing nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay which seemed interminable; after a weary scraping of wet\r\nfeet on the hall mat; after a mysterious, muttered interchange of\r\nquestion and answer outside the door, the two came in\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Clare leading\r\nthe way. The old man walked straight up to the table, without any\r\npreliminary greeting, and looked across it at the three women, with a\r\nstern pity for them in his ragged, wrinkled face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad news,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am an enemy to all unnecessary suspense.\r\nPlainness is kindness in such a case as this. I mean to be kind\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\ntell you plainly\xe2\x80\x94bad news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pendril followed him. He shook hands, in silence, with Miss Garth\r\nand the two sisters, and took a seat near them. Mr. Clare placed\r\nhimself apart on a chair by the window. The gray rainy light fell soft\r\nand sad on the faces of Norah and Magdalen, who sat together opposite\r\nto him. Miss Garth had placed herself a little behind them, in partial\r\nshadow; and the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s quiet face was seen in profile, close beside\r\nher. So the four occupants of the room appeared to Mr. Clare, as he sat\r\napart in his corner; his long claw-like fingers interlaced on his knee;\r\nhis dark vigilant eyes fixed searchingly now on one face, now on\r\nanother. The dripping rustle of the rain among the leaves, and the\r\nclear, ceaseless tick of the clock on the mantel-piece, made the minute\r\nof silence which followed the settling of the persons present in their\r\nplaces indescribably oppressive. It was a relief to every one when Mr.\r\nPendril spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Clare has told you already,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am the bearer of\r\nbad news. I am grieved to say, Miss Garth, that your doubts, when I\r\nlast saw you, were better founded than my hopes. What that heartless\r\nelder brother was in his youth, he is still in his old age. In all my\r\nunhappy experience of the worst side of human nature, I have never met\r\nwith a man so utterly dead to every consideration of mercy as Michael\r\nVanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that he takes the whole of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, and\r\nmakes no provision whatever for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s children?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss\r\nGarth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe offers a sum of money for present emergencies,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr.\r\nPendril, \xe2\x80\x9cso meanly and disgracefully insufficient that I am ashamed to\r\nmention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd nothing for the future?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs that answer was given, the same thought passed, at the same moment,\r\nthrough Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s mind and through Norah\xe2\x80\x99s. The decision, which\r\ndeprived both the sisters alike of the resources of fortune, did not\r\nend there for the younger of the two. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s merciless\r\nresolution had virtually pronounced the sentence which dismissed Frank\r\nto China, and which destroyed all present hope of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\r\nAs the words passed the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s lips, Miss Garth and Norah looked at\r\nMagdalen anxiously. Her face turned a shade paler\xe2\x80\x94but not a feature of\r\nit moved; not a word escaped her. Norah, who held her sister\xe2\x80\x99s hand in\r\nher own, felt it tremble for a moment, and then turn cold\xe2\x80\x94and that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me mention plainly what I have done,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr. Pendril; \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nvery desirous you should not think that I have left any effort untried.\r\nWhen I wrote to Michael Vanstone, in the first instance, I did not\r\nconfine myself to the usual formal statement. I put before him, plainly\r\nand earnestly, every one of the circumstances under which he has become\r\npossessed of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s fortune. When I received the answer,\r\nreferring me to his written instructions to his lawyer in London\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhen a copy of those instructions was placed in my hands\xe2\x80\x94I positively\r\ndeclined, on becoming acquainted with them, to receive the writer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndecision as final. I induced the solicitor, on the other side, to\r\naccord us a further term of delay; I attempted to see Mr. Noel Vanstone\r\nin London for the purpose of obtaining his intercession; and, failing\r\nin that, I myself wrote to his father for the second time. The answer\r\nreferred me, in insolently curt terms, to the instructions already\r\ncommunicated; declared those instructions to be final; and declined any\r\nfurther correspondence with me. There is the beginning and the end of\r\nthe negotiation. If I have overlooked any means of touching this\r\nheartless man\xe2\x80\x94tell me, and those means shall be tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at Norah. She pressed her sister\xe2\x80\x99s hand encouragingly, and\r\nanswered for both of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak for my sister, as well as for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with her\r\ncolor a little heightened, with her natural gentleness of manner just\r\ntouched by a quiet, uncomplaining sadness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have done all that\r\ncould be done, Mr. Pendril. We have tried to restrain ourselves from\r\nhoping too confidently; and we are deeply grateful for your kindness,\r\nat a time when kindness is sorely needed by both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s hand returned the pressure of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94withdrew\r\nitself\xe2\x80\x94trifled for a moment impatiently with the arrangement of her\r\ndress\xe2\x80\x94then suddenly moved the chair closer to the table. Leaning one\r\narm on it (with the hand fast clinched), she looked across at Mr.\r\nPendril. Her face, always remarkable for its want of color, was now\r\nstartling to contemplate, in its blank, bloodless pallor. But the light\r\nin her large gray eyes was bright and steady as ever; and her voice,\r\nthough low in tone, was clear and resolute in accent as she addressed\r\nthe lawyer in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understood you to say, Mr. Pendril, that my father\xe2\x80\x99s brother had\r\nsent his written orders to London, and that you had a copy. Have you\r\npreserved it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got it about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pendril hesitated, and looked uneasily from Magdalen to Miss Garth,\r\nand from Miss Garth back again to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray oblige me by not pressing your request,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is surely\r\nenough that you know the result of the instructions. Why should you\r\nagitate yourself to no purpose by reading them? They are expressed so\r\ncruelly; they show such abominable want of feeling, that I really\r\ncannot prevail upon myself to let you see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sensible of your kindness, Mr. Pendril, in wishing to spare me\r\npain. But I can bear pain; I promise to distress nobody. Will you\r\nexcuse me if I repeat my request?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand\xe2\x80\x94the soft, white, virgin hand that had touched\r\nnothing to soil it or harden it yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Magdalen, think again!\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou distress Mr. Pendril,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Garth; \xe2\x80\x9cyou distress us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no end gained,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the lawyer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cforgive me for saying\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94there can really be no useful end gained by my showing you the\r\ninstructions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cFools!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clare to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHave they no eyes to see that she\r\nmeans to have her own way?\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething tells me there is an end to be gained,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Magdalen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis decision is a very serious one. It is more serious to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlooked round at Mr. Clare, who sat closely watching her, and instantly\r\nlooked back again, with the first outward betrayal of emotion which had\r\nescaped her yet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is even more serious to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nprivate reasons\xe2\x80\x94than it is to my sister. I know nothing yet but that\r\nour father\xe2\x80\x99s brother has taken our fortunes from us. He must have some\r\nmotives of his own for such conduct as that. It is not fair to him, or\r\nfair to us, to keep those motives concealed. He has deliberately robbed\r\nNorah, and robbed me; and I think we have a right, if we wish it, to\r\nknow why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen; and once more she held out her hand.\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. Clare roused himself and interfered for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have relieved your conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the lawyer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive her the right she claims. It _is_ her right\xe2\x80\x94if she will have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pendril quietly took the written instructions from his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave warned you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94and handed the papers across the table\r\nwithout another word. One of the pages of writing\xe2\x80\x94was folded down at\r\nthe corner; and at that folded page the manuscript opened, when\r\nMagdalen first turned the leaves. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the place which refers to my\r\nsister and myself?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired. Mr. Pendril bowed; and Magdalen\r\nsmoothed out the manuscript before her on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you decide, Norah?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning to her sister. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I\r\nread this aloud, or shall I read it to myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth; answering for Norah, who looked at her\r\nin mute perplexity and distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be as you wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. With that reply, she turned\r\nagain to the manuscript and read these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . . You are now in possession of my wishes in relation to the\r\nproperty in money, and to the sale of the furniture, carriages, horses,\r\nand so forth. The last point left on which it is necessary for me to\r\ninstruct you refers to the persons inhabiting the house, and to certain\r\npreposterous claims on their behalf set up by a solicitor named\r\nPendril; who has, no doubt, interested reasons of his own for making\r\napplication to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that my late brother has left two illegitimate children;\r\nboth of them young women, who are of an age to earn their own\r\nlivelihood. Various considerations, all equally irregular, have been\r\nurged in respect to these persons by the solicitor representing them.\r\nBe so good as to tell him that neither you nor I have anything to do\r\nwith questions of mere sentiment; and then state plainly, for his\r\nbetter information, what the motives are which regulate my conduct, and\r\nwhat the provision is which I feel myself justified in making for the\r\ntwo young women. Your instructions on both these points you will find\r\ndetailed in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish the persons concerned to know, once for all, how I regard the\r\ncircumstances which have placed my late brother\xe2\x80\x99s property at my\r\ndisposal. Let them understand that I consider those circumstances to be\r\na Providential interposition which has restored to me the inheritance\r\nthat ought always to have been mine. I receive the money, not only as\r\nmy right, but also as a proper compensation for the injustice which I\r\nsuffered from my father, and a proper penalty paid by my younger\r\nbrother for the vile intrigue by which he succeeded in disinheriting\r\nme. His conduct, when a young man, was uniformly discreditable in all\r\nthe relations of life; and what it then was it continued to be (on the\r\nshowing of his own legal representative) after the time when I ceased\r\nto hold any communication with him. He appears to have systematically\r\nimposed a woman on Society as his wife who was not his wife, and to\r\nhave completed the outrage on morality by afterward marrying her. Such\r\nconduct as this has called down a Judgment on himself and his children.\r\nI will not invite retribution on my own head by assisting those\r\nchildren to continue the imposition which their parents practiced, and\r\nby helping them to take a place in the world to which they are not\r\nentitled. Let them, as becomes their birth, gain their bread in\r\nsituations. If they show themselves disposed to accept their proper\r\nposition I will assist them to start virtuously in life by a present of\r\none hundred pounds each. This sum I authorize you to pay them, on their\r\npersonal application, with the necessary acknowledgment of receipt; and\r\non the express understanding that the transaction, so completed, is to\r\nbe the beginning and the end of my connection with them. The\r\narrangements under which they quit the house I leave to your\r\ndiscretion; and I have only to add that my decision on this matter, as\r\non all other matters, is positive and final.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLine by line\xe2\x80\x94without once looking up from the pages before her\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Magdalen read those atrocious sentences through, from beginning to\r\nend. The other persons assembled in the room, all eagerly looking at\r\nher together, saw the dress rising and falling faster and faster over\r\nher bosom\xe2\x80\x94saw the hand in which she lightly held the manuscript at the\r\noutset close unconsciously on the paper and crush it, as she advanced\r\nnearer and nearer to the end\xe2\x80\x94but detected no other outward signs of\r\nwhat was passing within her. As soon as she had done, she silently\r\npushed the manuscript away, and put her hands on a sudden over her\r\nface. When she withdrew them, all the four persons in the room noticed\r\na change in her. Something in her expression had altered, subtly and\r\nsilently; something which made the familiar features suddenly look\r\nstrange, even to her sister and Miss Garth; something, through all\r\nafter years, never to be forgotten in connection with that day\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnever to be described.\r\n\r\nThe first words she spoke were addressed to Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask one more favor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you enter on your\r\nbusiness arrangements?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pendril replied ceremoniously by a gesture of assent. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution to possess herself of the Instructions did not appear to\r\nhave produced a favorable impression on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mentioned what you were so kind as to do, in our interests, when\r\nyou first wrote to Mr. Michael Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you\r\nhad told him all the circumstances. I want\xe2\x80\x94if you will allow me\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\nmade quite sure of what he really knew about us\xe2\x80\x94when he sent these\r\norders to his lawyer. Did he know that my father had made a will, and\r\nthat he had left our fortunes to my sister and myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you tell him how it happened that we are left in this helpless\r\nposition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him that your father was entirely unaware, when he married, of\r\nthe necessity for making another will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that another will would have been made, after he saw Mr. Clare,\r\nbut for the dreadful misfortune of his death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew that also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he know that my father\xe2\x80\x99s untiring goodness and kindness to both of\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered for the first time: she sighed, and put her hand to\r\nher head wearily. Norah spoke entreatingly to her; Miss Garth spoke\r\nentreatingly to her; Mr. Clare sat silent, watching her more and more\r\nearnestly. She answered her sister\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrance with a faint smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will keep my promise,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will distress nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d With that\r\nreply, she turned again to Mr. Pendril; and steadily reiterated the\r\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94but in another form of words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr. Michael Vanstone know that my father\xe2\x80\x99s great anxiety was to\r\nmake sure of providing for my sister and myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew it in your father\xe2\x80\x99s own words. I sent him an extract from your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s last letter to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter which asked you to come for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and relieve him\r\nfrom the dreadful thought that his daughters were unprovided for? The\r\nletter which said he should not rest in his grave if he left us\r\ndisinherited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat letter and those words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, still keeping her eyes steadily fixed on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to fasten it all in my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I go on. Mr.\r\nMichael Vanstone knew of the first will; he knew what prevented the\r\nmaking of the second will; he knew of the letter and he read the words.\r\nWhat did he know of besides? Did you tell him of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nillness? Did you say that her share in the money would have been left\r\nto us, if she could have lifted her dying hand in your presence? Did\r\nyou try to make him ashamed of the cruel law which calls girls in our\r\nsituation Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s Children, and which allows him to use us as he is\r\nusing us now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put all those considerations to him. I left none of them doubtful; I\r\nleft none of them out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slowly reached her hand to the copy of the Instructions, and slowly\r\nfolded it up again, in the shape in which it had been presented to her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you, Mr. Pendril.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words, she bowed,\r\nand gently pushed the manuscript back across the table; then turned to\r\nher sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif we both of us live to grow old, and if you ever\r\nforget all that we owe to Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94come to me, and I will\r\nremind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose and walked across the room by herself to the window. As she\r\npassed Mr. Clare, the old man stretched out his claw-like fingers and\r\ncaught her fast by the arm before she was aware of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this mask of yours hiding?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, forcing her to bend to\r\nhim, and looking close into her face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of the extremes of human\r\ntemperature does your courage start from\xe2\x80\x94the dead cold or the white\r\nhot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrank back from him and turned away her head in silence. She would\r\nhave resented that unscrupulous intrusion on her own thoughts from any\r\nman alive but Frank\xe2\x80\x99s father. He dropped her arm as suddenly as he had\r\ntaken it, and let her go on to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnot the cold extreme, whatever else it may be. So much the worse for\r\nher, and for all belonging to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause. Once more the dripping rustle of the rain\r\nand the steady ticking of the clock filled up the gap of silence. Mr.\r\nPendril put the Instructions back in his pocket, considered a little,\r\nand, turning toward Norah and Miss Garth, recalled their attention to\r\nthe present and pressing necessities of the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur consultation has been needlessly prolonged,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cby painful\r\nreferences to the past. We shall be better employed in settling our\r\narrangements for the future. I am obliged to return to town this\r\nevening. Pray let me hear how I can best assist you; pray tell me what\r\ntrouble and what responsibility I can take off your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the moment, neither Norah nor Miss Garth seemed to be capable of\r\nanswering him. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s reception of the news which annihilated the\r\nmarriage prospect that her father\xe2\x80\x99s own lips had placed before her not\r\na month since, had bewildered and dismayed them alike. They had\r\nsummoned their courage to meet the shock of her passionate grief, or to\r\nface the harder trial of witnessing her speechless despair. But they\r\nwere not prepared for her invincible resolution to read the\r\nInstructions; for the terrible questions which she had put to the\r\nlawyer; for her immovable determination to fix all the circumstances in\r\nher mind, under which Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s decision had been pronounced.\r\nThere she stood at the window, an unfathomable mystery to the sister\r\nwho had never been parted from her, to the governess who had trained\r\nher from a child. Miss Garth remembered the dark doubts which had\r\ncrossed her mind on the day when she and Magdalen had met in the\r\ngarden. Norah looked forward to the coming time, with the first serious\r\ndread of it on her sister\xe2\x80\x99s account which she had felt yet. Both had\r\nhitherto remained passive, in despair of knowing what to do. Both were\r\nnow silent, in despair of knowing what to say.\r\n\r\nMr. Pendril patiently and kindly helped them, by returning to the\r\nsubject of their future plans for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to press any business matters on your attention,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen you are necessarily unfitted to deal with them. But I must take\r\nmy instructions back to London with me to-night. With reference, in the\r\nfirst place, to the disgraceful pecuniary offer, to which I have\r\nalready alluded. The younger Miss Vanstone having read the\r\nInstructions, needs no further information from my lips. The elder\r\nwill, I hope, excuse me if I tell her (what I should be ashamed to tell\r\nher, but that it is a matter of necessity), that Mr. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprovision for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s children begins and ends with an offer to\r\neach of them of one hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s face crimsoned with indignation. She started to her feet, as if\r\nMichael Vanstone had been present in the room, and had personally\r\ninsulted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, wishing to spare her; \xe2\x80\x9cI may tell Mr. Michael\r\nVanstone you refuse the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out passionately, \xe2\x80\x9cif I was starving by the\r\nroadside, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch a farthing of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I notify your refusal also?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Pendril, speaking to\r\nMagdalen next.\r\n\r\nShe turned round from the window\xe2\x80\x94but kept her face in shadow, by\r\nstanding close against it with her back to the light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him, on my part,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto think again before he starts me\r\nin life with a hundred pounds. I will give him time to think.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nspoke those strange words with a marked emphasis; and turning back\r\nquickly to the window, hid her face from the observation of every one\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou both refuse the offer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pendril, taking out his pencil,\r\nand making his professional note of the decision. As he shut up his\r\npocketbook, he glanced toward Magdalen doubtfully. She had roused in\r\nhim the latent distrust which is a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s second nature: he had his\r\nsuspicions of her looks; he had his suspicions of her language. Her\r\nsister seemed to have mere influence over her than Miss Garth. He\r\nresolved to speak privately to her sister before he went away.\r\n\r\nWhile the idea was passing through his mind, his attention was claimed\r\nby another question from Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he an old man?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, suddenly, without turning round from the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean Mr. Michael Vanstone, he is seventy-five or seventy-six\r\nyears of age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke of his son a little while since. Has he any other sons\xe2\x80\x94or\r\ndaughters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything of his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been dead for many years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask these questions?\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t ask any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the third time, Mr. Pendril returned to the business of the\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants must not be forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must be settled\r\nwith and discharged: I will give them the necessary explanation before\r\nI leave. As for the house, no questions connected with it need trouble\r\nyou. The carriages and horses, the furniture and plate, and so on, must\r\nsimply be left on the premises to await Mr. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s further\r\norders. But any possessions, Miss Vanstone, personally belonging to you\r\nor to your sister\xe2\x80\x94jewelry and dresses, and any little presents which\r\nmay have been made to you\xe2\x80\x94are entirely at your disposal. With regard to\r\nthe time of your departure, I understand that a month or more will\r\nelapse before Mr. Michael Vanstone can leave Zurich; and I am sure I\r\nonly do his solicitor justice in saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Mr. Pendril,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Norah; \xe2\x80\x9cI think I understand, from\r\nwhat you have just said, that our house and everything in it belongs\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, as if the mere utterance of the man\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nabhorrent to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Michael Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pendril. \xe2\x80\x9cThe house goes to him with\r\nthe rest of the property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I, for one, am ready to leave it tomorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen started at the window, as her sister spoke, and looked at Mr.\r\nClare, with the first open signs of anxiety and alarm which she had\r\nshown yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, stooping over the old man with\r\na sudden humility of look, and a sudden nervousness of manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo without seeing Frank first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cI am here to speak to you\r\nabout it, when the business is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite unnecessary to hurry your departure, as you propose,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Mr. Pendril, addressing Norah. \xe2\x80\x9cI can safely assure you that\r\na week hence will be time enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this is Mr. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s house,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Norah; \xe2\x80\x9cI am ready\r\nto leave it tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe impatiently quitted her chair and seated herself further away on\r\nthe sofa. As she laid her hand on the back of it, her face changed.\r\nThere, at the head of the sofa, were the cushions which had supported\r\nher mother when she lay down for the last time to repose. There, at the\r\nfoot of the sofa, was the clumsy, old-fashioned arm-chair, which had\r\nbeen her father\xe2\x80\x99s favorite seat on rainy days, when she and her sister\r\nused to amuse him at the piano opposite, by playing his favorite tunes.\r\nA heavy sigh, which she tried vainly to repress, burst from her lips.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten these old friends! How shall we\r\npart from them when the time comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire, Miss Vanstone, whether you and your sister have formed\r\nany definite plans for the future?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Pendril. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nthought of any place of residence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may take it on myself, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Garth, \xe2\x80\x9cto answer your\r\nquestion for them. When they leave this house, they leave it with me.\r\nMy home is their home, and my bread is their bread. Their parents\r\nhonored me, trusted me, and loved me. For twelve happy years they never\r\nlet me remember that I was their governess; they only let me know\r\nmyself as their companion and their friend. My memory of them is the\r\nmemory of unvarying gentleness and generosity; and my life shall pay\r\nthe debt of my gratitude to their orphan children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorah rose hastily from the sofa; Magdalen impetuously left the window.\r\nFor once, there was no contrast in the conduct of the sisters. For\r\nonce, the same impulse moved their hearts, the same earnest feeling\r\ninspired their words. Miss Garth waited until the first outburst of\r\nemotion had passed away; then rose, and, taking Norah and Magdalen each\r\nby the hand, addressed herself to Mr. Pendril and Mr. Clare. She spoke\r\nwith perfect self-possession; strong in her artless unconsciousness of\r\nher own good action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven such a trifle as my own story,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis of some importance\r\nat such a moment as this. I wish you both, gentlemen, to understand\r\nthat I am not promising more to the daughters of your old friend than I\r\ncan perform. When I first came to this house, I entered it under such\r\nindependent circumstances as are not common in the lives of\r\ngovernesses. In my younger days, I was associated in teaching with my\r\nelder sister: we established a school in London, which grew to be a\r\nlarge and prosperous one. I only left it, and became a private\r\ngoverness, because the heavy responsibility of the school was more than\r\nmy strength could bear. I left my share in the profits untouched, and I\r\npossess a pecuniary interest in our establishment to this day. That is\r\nmy story, in few words. When we leave this house, I propose that we\r\nshall go back to the school in London, which is still prosperously\r\ndirected by my elder sister. We can live there as quietly as we please,\r\nuntil time has helped us to bear our affliction better than we can bear\r\nit now. If Norah\xe2\x80\x99s and Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s altered prospects oblige them to earn\r\ntheir own independence, I can help them to earn it, as a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughters should. The best families in this land are glad to ask my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s advice where the interests of their children\xe2\x80\x99s home-training\r\nare concerned; and I answer, beforehand, for her hearty desire to serve\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, as I answer for my own. That is the future\r\nwhich my gratitude to their father and mother, and my love for\r\nthemselves, now offers to them. If you think my proposal, gentlemen, a\r\nfit and fair proposal\xe2\x80\x94and I see in your faces that you do\xe2\x80\x94let us not\r\nmake the hard necessities of our position harder still, by any useless\r\ndelay in meeting them at once. Let us do what we must do; let us act on\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and leave this house to-morrow. You mentioned the\r\nservants just now, Mr. Pendril: I am ready to call them together in the\r\nnext room, and to assist you in the settlement of their claims,\r\nwhenever you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s answer, without leaving the sisters\r\ntime to realize their own terrible situation, she moved at once toward\r\nthe door. It was her wise resolution to meet the coming trial by doing\r\nmuch and saying little. Before she could leave the room, Mr. Clare\r\nfollowed, and stopped her on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never envied a woman\xe2\x80\x99s feelings before,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may\r\nsurprise you to hear it; but I envy yours. Wait! I have something more\r\nto say. There is an obstacle still left\xe2\x80\x94the everlasting obstacle of\r\nFrank. Help me to sweep him off. Take the elder sister along with you\r\nand the lawyer, and leave me here to have it out with the younger. I\r\nwant to see what metal she\xe2\x80\x99s really made of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Clare was addressing these words to Miss Garth, Mr. Pendril\r\nhad taken the opportunity of speaking to Norah. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I go back to\r\ntown,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have a word with you in private. From\r\nwhat has passed today, Miss Vanstone, I have formed a very high opinion\r\nof your discretion; and, as an old friend of your father\xe2\x80\x99s, I want to\r\ntake the freedom of speaking to you about your sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Norah could answer, she was summoned, in compliance with Mr.\r\nClare\xe2\x80\x99s request, to the conference with the servants. Mr. Pendril\r\nfollowed Miss Garth, as a matter of course. When the three were out in\r\nthe hall, Mr. Clare re-entered the room, closed the door, and signed\r\nperemptorily to Magdalen to take a chair.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed him in silence. He took a turn up and down the room, with\r\nhis hands in the side-pockets of the long, loose, shapeless coat which\r\nhe habitually wore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stopping suddenly, and speaking to her with\r\nthe whole breadth of the room between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was eighteen last birthday,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, humbly, without looking\r\nup at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have shown extraordinary courage for a girl of eighteen. Have you\r\ngot any of that courage left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands together, and wrung them hard. A few tears\r\ngathered in her eyes, and rolled slowly over her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t give Frank up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care for me, I\r\nknow; but you used to care for my father. Will you try to be kind to me\r\nfor my father\xe2\x80\x99s sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last words died away in a whisper; she could say no more. Never had\r\nshe felt the illimitable power which a woman\xe2\x80\x99s love possesses of\r\nabsorbing into itself every other event, every other joy or sorrow of\r\nher life, as she felt it then. Never had she so tenderly associated\r\nFrank with the memory of her lost parents, as at that moment. Never had\r\nthe impenetrable atmosphere of illusion through which women behold the\r\nman of their choice\xe2\x80\x94the atmosphere which had blinded her to all that\r\nwas weak, selfish, and mean in Frank\xe2\x80\x99s nature\xe2\x80\x94surrounded him with a\r\nbrighter halo than now, when she was pleading with the father for the\r\npossession of the son. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to give him up!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ntrying to take courage, and shuddering from head to foot. In the next\r\ninstant, she flew to the opposite extreme, with the suddenness of a\r\nflash of lightning. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t give him up!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out violently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! not if a thousand fathers ask me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am one father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the first astonishment and delight of hearing those unexpected\r\nwords, she started to her feet, crossed the room, and tried to throw\r\nher arms round his neck. She might as well have attempted to move the\r\nhouse from its foundations. He took her by the shoulders and put her\r\nback in her chair. His inexorable eyes looked her into submission; and\r\nhis lean forefinger shook at her warningly, as if he was quieting a\r\nfractious child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHug Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t hug me. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done with you yet; when\r\nI have, you may shake hands with me, if you like. Wait, and compose\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left her. His hands went back into his pockets, and his monotonous\r\nmarch up and down the room began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, stopping short after a while. She tried to answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake two minutes more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and resumed his walk with the\r\nregularity of clock-work. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the creatures,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cinto whose keeping men otherwise sensible give the happiness\r\nof their lives. Is there any other object in creation, I wonder, which\r\nanswers its end as badly as a woman does?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped before her once more. Her breathing was easier; the dark\r\nflush on her face was dying out again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; ready at last. Listen to me; and let\xe2\x80\x99s get\r\nit over. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to give Frank up. I ask you to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cPatiently, willingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you make Frank wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you send him to China?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer head drooped upon her bosom, and she clasped her hands again, in\r\nsilence. Mr. Clare saw where the difficulty lay, and marched straight\r\nup to it on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to enter into your feelings for Frank, or Frank\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe subject doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interest me. But I _do_ pretend to\r\nstate two plain truths. It is one plain truth that you can\xe2\x80\x99t be married\r\ntill you have money enough to pay for the roof that shelters you, the\r\nclothes that cover you, and the victuals you eat. It is another plain\r\ntruth that you can\xe2\x80\x99t find the money; that I can\xe2\x80\x99t find the money; and\r\nthat Frank\xe2\x80\x99s only chance of finding it, is going to China. If I tell\r\nhim to go, he\xe2\x80\x99ll sit in a corner and cry. If I insist, he\xe2\x80\x99ll say Yes,\r\nand deceive me. If I go a step further, and see him on board ship with\r\nmy own eyes, he\xe2\x80\x99ll slip off in the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s boat, and sneak back\r\nsecretly to you. That\xe2\x80\x99s his disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not his disposition; it\xe2\x80\x99s his love for Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall it what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Clare. \xe2\x80\x9cSneak or Sweetheart \xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo slippery, in either capacity, for my fingers to hold him. My\r\nshutting the door won\xe2\x80\x99t keep him from coming back. Your shutting the\r\ndoor will. Have you the courage to shut it? Are you fond enough of him\r\nnot to stand in his light?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFond! I would die for him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you send him to China?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a little pity for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have lost my father; I have\r\nlost my mother; I have lost my fortune\xe2\x80\x94and now I am to lose Frank. You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like women, I know; but try to help me with a little pity. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s not for his own interests to send him to China; I only\r\nsay it\xe2\x80\x99s hard\xe2\x80\x94very, very hard on _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clare had been deaf to her violence, insensible to her caresses,\r\nblind to her tears; but under the tough integument of his philosophy he\r\nhad a heart\xe2\x80\x94and it answered that hopeless appeal; it felt those\r\ntouching words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that your case is a hard one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nmake it harder. I only ask you to do in Frank\xe2\x80\x99s interests what Frank is\r\ntoo weak to do for himself. It\xe2\x80\x99s no fault of yours; it\xe2\x80\x99s no fault of\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the less true that the fortune you were to have\r\nbrought him has changed owners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe suddenly looked up, with a furtive light in her eyes, with a\r\nthreatening smile on her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may change owners again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nMr. Clare saw the alteration in her expression, and heard the tones of\r\nher voice. But the words were spoken low; spoken as if to herself\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nfailed to reach him across the breadth of the room. He stopped\r\ninstantly in his walk and asked what she had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, turning her head away toward the window, and\r\nlooking out mechanically at the falling rain. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly my own thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clare resumed his walk, and returned to his subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your interest,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as Frank\xe2\x80\x99s interest, that he\r\nshould go. He may make money enough to marry you in China; he can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake it here. If he stops at home, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the ruin of both of you.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll shut his eyes to every consideration of prudence, and pester you\r\nto marry him; and when he has carried his point, he will be the first\r\nto turn round afterward and complain that you\xe2\x80\x99re a burden on him. Hear\r\nme out! You\xe2\x80\x99re in love with Frank\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not, and I know him. Put you two\r\ntogether often enough; give him time enough to hug, cry, pester, and\r\nplead; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what the end will be\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had touched the right string at last. It rung back in answer before\r\nhe could add another word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I can\r\nsuffer for Frank\xe2\x80\x99s sake. He shall never marry me till I can be what my\r\nfather said I should be\xe2\x80\x94the making of his fortune. He shall take no\r\nburden, when he takes me; I promise you that! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the good angel of\r\nFrank\xe2\x80\x99s life; I\xe2\x80\x99ll not go a penniless girl to him, and drag him down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe abruptly left her seat, advanced a few steps toward Mr. Clare, and\r\nstopped in the middle of the room. Her arms fell helpless on either\r\nside of her, and she burst into tears. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf my\r\nheart breaks in doing it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him to-morrow that we must say\r\nGood-by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clare at once advanced to meet her, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFrank shall hear every word that has passed\r\nbetween us. When he comes to-morrow he shall know, beforehand, that he\r\ncomes to say Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took his hand in both her own\xe2\x80\x94hesitated\xe2\x80\x94looked at him\xe2\x80\x94and pressed\r\nit to her bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask a favor of you, before you go?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ntimidly. He tried to take his hand from her; but she knew her\r\nadvantage, and held it fast. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose there should be some change for\r\nthe better?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I could come to Frank, as my fat her\r\nsaid I should come to him\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore she could complete the question, Mr. Clare made a second effort\r\nand withdrew his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAs your father said you should come to him?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, looking at her attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cStrange things happen sometimes. If strange things\r\nhappen to me will you let Frank come back before the five years are\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat did she mean? Was she clinging desperately to the hope of melting\r\nMichael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s heart? Mr. Clare could draw no other conclusion from\r\nwhat she had just said to him. At the beginning of the interview he\r\nwould have roughly dispelled her delusion. At the end of the interview\r\nhe left her compassionately in possession of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are hoping against all hope,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if it gives you\r\ncourage, hope on. If this impossible good fortune of yours ever\r\nhappens, tell me, and Frank shall come back. In the meantime\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have my promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s sharp eyes searched her face attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will trust your promise,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see Frank to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went back thoughtfully to her chair, and sat down again in silence.\r\nMr. Clare made for the door before any formal leave-taking could pass\r\nbetween them. \xe2\x80\x9cDeep!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, as he looked back at her\r\nbefore he went out; \xe2\x80\x9conly eighteen; and too deep for my sounding!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the hall he found Norah, waiting anxiously to hear what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it all over?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Frank go to China?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful how you manage that sister of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clare,\r\nwithout noticing the question. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has one great misfortune to contend\r\nwith: she\xe2\x80\x99s not made for the ordinary jog-trot of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say I can see straight to the end of the good or evil in her\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nonly warn you, her future will be no common one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Mr. Pendril left the house; and, by that night\xe2\x80\x99s post,\r\nMiss Garth dispatched a letter to her sister in London.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FIRST SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\r\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nFrom Norah Vanstone to Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWestmoreland House, Kensington,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 14th, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. PENDRIL,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe date of this letter will show you that the last of many hard\r\npartings is over. We have left Combe-Raven; we have said farewell to\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking seriously of what you said to me on Wednesday,\r\nbefore you went back to town. I entirely agree with you that Miss Garth\r\nis more shaken by all she has gone through for our sakes than she is\r\nherself willing to admit; and that it is my duty, for the future, to\r\nspare her all the anxiety that I can on the subject of my sister and\r\nmyself. This is very little to do for our dearest friend, for our\r\nsecond mother. Such as it is, I will do it with all my heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, forgive me for saying that I am as far as ever from agreeing with\r\nyou about Magdalen. I am so sensible, in our helpless position, of the\r\nimportance of your assistance; so anxious to be worthy of the interest\r\nof my father\xe2\x80\x99s trusted adviser and oldest friend, that I feel really\r\nand truly disappointed with myself for differing with you\xe2\x80\x94and yet I do\r\ndiffer. Magdalen is very strange, very unaccountable, to those who\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know her intimately. I can understand that she has innocently\r\nmisled you; and that she has presented herself, perhaps, under her\r\nleast favorable aspect. But that the clue to her language and her\r\nconduct on Wednesday last is to be found in such a feeling toward the\r\nman who has ruined us, as the feeling at which you hinted, is what I\r\ncannot and will not believe of my sister. If you knew, as I do, what a\r\nnoble nature she has, you would not be surprised at this obstinate\r\nresistance of mine to your opinion. Will you try to alter it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind what Mr. Clare says; he believes in nothing. But I attach a very\r\nserious importance to what _you_ say; and, kind as I know your motives\r\nto be, it distresses me to think you are doing Magdalen an injustice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving relieved my mind of this confession, I may now come to the\r\nproper object of my letter. I promised, if you could not find leisure\r\ntime to visit us to-day, to write and tell you all that happened after\r\nyou left us. The day has passed without our seeing you. So I open my\r\nwriting-case and perform my promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say that three of the women-servants\xe2\x80\x94the house-maid, the\r\nkitchen-maid, and even our own maid (to whom I am sure we have always\r\nbeen kind)\xe2\x80\x94took advantage of your having paid them their wages to pack\r\nup and go as soon as your back was turned. They came to say good-by\r\nwith as much ceremony and as little feeling as if they were leaving the\r\nhouse under ordinary circumstances. The cook, for all her violent\r\ntemper, behaved very differently: she sent up a message to say that she\r\nwould stop and help us to the last. And Thomas (who has never yet been\r\nin any other place than ours) spoke so gratefully of my dear father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunvarying kindness to him, and asked so anxiously to be allowed to go\r\non serving us while his little savings lasted, that Magdalen and I\r\nforgot all formal considerations and both shook hands with him. The\r\npoor lad went out of the room crying. I wish him well; I hope he will\r\nfind a kind master and a good place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe long, quiet, rainy evening out-of-doors\xe2\x80\x94our last evening at\r\nCombe-Raven\xe2\x80\x94was a sad trial to us. I think winter-time would have\r\nweighed less on our spirits; the drawn curtains and the bright lamps,\r\nand the companionable fires would have helped us. We were only five in\r\nthe house altogether\xe2\x80\x94after having once been so many! I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\r\nhow dreary the gray daylight looked, toward seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in the\r\nlonely rooms, and on the noiseless staircase. Surely, the prejudice in\r\nfavor of long summer evenings is the prejudice of happy people? We did\r\nour best. We kept ourselves employed, and Miss Garth helped us. The\r\nprospect of preparing for our departure, which had seemed so dreadful\r\nearlier in the day, altered into the prospect of a refuge from\r\nourselves as the evening came on. We each tried at first to pack up in\r\nour own rooms\xe2\x80\x94but the loneliness was more than we could bear. We\r\ncarried all our possessions downstairs, and heaped them on the large\r\ndining-table, and so made our preparations together in the same room. I\r\nam sure we have taken nothing away which does not properly belong to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving already mentioned to you my own conviction that Magdalen was\r\nnot herself when you saw her on Wednesday, I feel tempted to stop here\r\nand give you an instance in proof of what I say. The little\r\ncircumstance happened on Wednesday night, just before we went up to our\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter we had packed our dresses and our birthday presents, our books\r\nand our music, we began to sort our letters, which had got confused\r\nfrom being placed on the table together. Some of my letters were mixed\r\nwith Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s, and some of hers with mine. Among these last I found a\r\ncard, which had been given to my sister early in the year by an actor\r\nwho managed an amateur theatrical performance in which she took a part.\r\nThe man had given her the card, containing his name and address, in the\r\nbelief that she would be invited to many more amusements of the same\r\nkind, and in the hope that she would recommend him as a superintendent\r\non future occasions. I only relate these trifling particulars to show\r\nyou how little worth keeping such a card could be, in such\r\ncircumstances as ours. Naturally enough, I threw it away from me across\r\nthe table, meaning to throw it on the floor. It fell short, close to\r\nthe place in which Magdalen was sitting. She took it up, looked at it,\r\nand immediately declared that she would not have had this perfectly\r\nworthless thing destroyed for the world. She was almost angry with me\r\nfor having thrown it away; almost angry with Miss Garth for asking what\r\nshe could possibly want with it! Could there be any plainer proof than\r\nthis that our misfortunes\xe2\x80\x94falling so much more heavily on her than on\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94have quite unhinged her, and worn her out? Surely her words and\r\nlooks are not to be interpreted against her, when she is not\r\nsufficiently mistress of herself to exert her natural judgment\xe2\x80\x94when she\r\nshows the unreasonable petulance of a child on a question which is not\r\nof the slightest importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little after eleven we went upstairs to try if we could get some\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drew aside the curtain of my window and looked out. Oh, what a cruel\r\nlast night it was: no moon, no stars; such deep darkness that not one\r\nof the dear familiar objects in the garden was visible when I looked\r\nfor them; such deep stillness that even my own movements about the room\r\nalmost frightened me! I tried to lie down and sleep, but the sense of\r\nloneliness came again and quite overpowered me. You will say I am old\r\nenough, at six-and-twenty, to have exerted more control over myself. I\r\nhardly know how it happened, but I stole into Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s room, just as\r\nI used to steal into it years and years ago, when we were children. She\r\nwas not in bed; she was sitting with her writing materials before her,\r\nthinking. I said I wanted to be with her the last night; and she kissed\r\nme, and told me to lie down, and promised soon to follow me. My mind\r\nwas a little quieted and I fell asleep. It was daylight when I woke\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe first sight I saw was Magdalen, still sitting in the chair, and\r\nstill thinking. She had never been to bed; she had not slept all\r\nthrough the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I shall sleep when we have left Combe-Raven,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98I shall be\r\nbetter when it is all over, and I have bid Frank good-by.\xe2\x80\x99 She had in\r\nher hand our father\xe2\x80\x99s will, and the letter he wrote to you; and when\r\nshe had done speaking, she gave them into my possession. I was the\r\neldest (she said), and those last precious relics ought to be in my\r\nkeeping. I tried to propose to her that we should divide them; but she\r\nshook her head. \xe2\x80\x98I have copied for myself,\xe2\x80\x99 was her answer, \xe2\x80\x98all that\r\nhe says of us in the will, and all that he says in the letter.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\ntold me this, and took from her bosom a tiny white silk bag, which she\r\nhad made in the night, and in which she had put the extracts, so as to\r\nkeep them always about her. \xe2\x80\x98This tells me in his own words what his\r\nlast wishes were for both of us,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98and this is all I want for\r\nthe future.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are trifles to dwell on; and I am almost surprised at myself for\r\nnot feeling ashamed to trouble you with them. But, since I have known\r\nwhat your early connection was with my father and mother, I have\r\nlearned to think of you (and, I suppose, to write to you) as an old\r\nfriend. And, besides, I have it so much at heart to change your opinion\r\nof Magdalen, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t help telling you the smallest things about\r\nher which may, in my judgment, end in making you think of her as I do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen breakfast-time came (on Thursday morning), we were surprised to\r\nfind a strange letter on the table. Perhaps I ought to mention it to\r\nyou, in case of any future necessity for your interference. It was\r\naddressed to Miss Garth, on paper with the deepest mourning-border\r\nround it; and the writer was the same man who followed us on our way\r\nhome from a walk one day last spring\xe2\x80\x94Captain Wragge. His object appears\r\nto be to assert once more his audacious claim to a family connection\r\nwith my poor mother, under cover of a letter of condolence; which it is\r\nan insolence in such a person to have written at all. He expresses as\r\nmuch sympathy\xe2\x80\x94on his discovery of our affliction in the newspaper\xe2\x80\x94as if\r\nhe had been really intimate with us; and he begs to know, in a\r\npostscript (being evidently in total ignorance of all that has really\r\nhappened), whether it is thought desirable that he should be present,\r\namong the other relatives, at the reading of the will! The address he\r\ngives, at which letters will reach him for the next fortnight, is,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Post-office, Birmingham.\xe2\x80\x99 This is all I have to tell you on the\r\nsubject. Both the letter and the writer seem to me to be equally\r\nunworthy of the slightest notice, on our part or on yours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter breakfast Magdalen left us, and went by herself into the\r\nmorning-room. The weather being still showery, we had arranged that\r\nFrancis Clare should see her in that room, when he presented himself to\r\ntake his leave. I was upstairs when he came; and I remained upstairs\r\nfor more than half an hour afterward, sadly anxious, as you may well\r\nbelieve, on Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the half-hour or more, I came downstairs. As I reached\r\nthe landing I suddenly heard her voice, raised entreatingly, and\r\ncalling on him by his name\xe2\x80\x94then loud sobs\xe2\x80\x94then a frightful laughing and\r\nscreaming, both together, that rang through the house. I instantly ran\r\ninto the room, and found Magdalen on the sofa in violent hysterics, and\r\nFrank standing staring at her, with a lowering, angry face, biting his\r\nnails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt so indignant\xe2\x80\x94without knowing plainly why, for I was ignorant,\r\nof course, of what had passed at the interview\xe2\x80\x94that I took Mr. Francis\r\nClare by the shoulders and pushed him out of the room. I am careful to\r\ntell you how I acted toward him, and what led to it; because I\r\nunderstand that he is excessively offended with me, and that he is\r\nlikely to mention elsewhere what he calls my unladylike violence toward\r\nhim. If he should mention it to you, I am anxious to acknowledge, of my\r\nown accord, that I forgot myself\xe2\x80\x94not, I hope you will think, without\r\nsome provocation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pushed him into the hall, leaving Magdalen, for the moment, to Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s care. Instead of going away, he sat down sulkily on one of the\r\nhall chairs. \xe2\x80\x98May I ask the reason of this extraordinary violence?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ninquired, with an injured look. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98You will be good enough\r\nto imagine the reason for yourself, and to leave us immediately, if you\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x99 He sat doggedly in the chair, biting his nails and\r\nconsidering. \xe2\x80\x98What have I done to be treated in this unfeeling manner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe asked, after a while. \xe2\x80\x98I can enter into no discussion with you,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nanswered; \xe2\x80\x98I can only request you to leave us. If you persist in\r\nwaiting to see my sister again, I will go to the cottage myself and\r\nappeal to your father.\xe2\x80\x99 He got up in a great hurry at those words. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave been infamously used in this business,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98All the\r\nhardships and the sacrifices have fallen to my share. I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one\r\namong you who has any heart: all the rest are as hard as\r\nstones\xe2\x80\x94Magdalen included. In one breath she says she loves me, and in\r\nanother she tells me to go to China. What have I done to be treated\r\nwith this heartless inconsistency? I am consistent myself\xe2\x80\x94I only want\r\nto stop at home\xe2\x80\x94and (what\xe2\x80\x99s the consequence?) you\xe2\x80\x99re all against me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nIn that manner he grumbled his way down the steps, and so I saw the\r\nlast of him. This was all that passed between us. If he gives you any\r\nother account of it, what he says will be false. He made no attempt to\r\nreturn. An hour afterward his father came alone to say good-by. He saw\r\nMiss Garth and me, but not Magdalen; and he told us he would take the\r\nnecessary measures, with your assistance, for having his son properly\r\nlooked after in London, and seen safely on board the vessel when the\r\ntime came. It was a short visit, and a sad leave-taking. Even Mr. Clare\r\nwas sorry, though he tried hard to hide it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had barely two hours, after Mr. Clare had left us, before it would\r\nbe time to go. I went back to Magdalen, and found her quieter and\r\nbetter, though terribly pale and exhausted, and oppressed, as I\r\nfancied, by thoughts which she could not prevail on herself to\r\ncommunicate. She would tell me nothing then\xe2\x80\x94she has told me nothing\r\nsince\xe2\x80\x94of what passed between herself and Francis Clare. When I spoke of\r\nhim angrily (feeling as I did that he had distressed and tortured her,\r\nwhen she ought to have had all the encouragement and comfort from him\r\nthat man could give), she refused to hear me: she made the kindest\r\nallowances and the sweetest excuses for him, and laid all the blame of\r\nthe dreadful state in which I had found her entirely on herself. Was I\r\nwrong in telling you that she had a noble nature? And won\xe2\x80\x99t you alter\r\nyour opinion when you read these lines?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had no friends to come and bid us good-by; and our few\r\nacquaintances were too far from us\xe2\x80\x94perhaps too indifferent about us\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ncall. We employed the little leisure left in going over the house\r\ntogether for the last time. We took leave of our old schoolroom, our\r\nbedrooms, the room where our mother died, the little study where our\r\nfather used to settle his accounts and write his letters\xe2\x80\x94feeling toward\r\nthem, in our forlorn condition, as other girls might have felt at\r\nparting with old friends. From the house, in a gleam of fine weather,\r\nwe went into the garden, and gathered our last nosegay; with the\r\npurpose of drying the flowers when they begin to wither, and keeping\r\nthem in remembrance of the happy days that are gone. When we had said\r\ngood-by to the garden, there was only half an hour left. We went\r\ntogether to the grave; we knelt down, side by side, in silence, and\r\nkissed the sacred ground. I thought my heart would have broken. August\r\nwas the month of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s birthday; and, this time last year, my\r\nfather and Magdalen and I were all consulting in secret what present we\r\ncould make to surprise her with on the birthday morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had seen how Magdalen suffered, you would never doubt her\r\nagain. I had to take her from the last resting-place of our father and\r\nmother almost by force. Before we were out of the churchyard she broke\r\nfrom me and ran back. She dropped on her knees at the grave; tore up\r\nfrom it passionately a handful of grass; and said something to herself,\r\nat the same moment, which, though I followed her instantly, I did not\r\nget near enough to hear. She turned on me in such a frenzied manner,\r\nwhen I tried to raise her from the ground\xe2\x80\x94she looked at me with such a\r\nfearful wildness in her eyes\xe2\x80\x94that I felt absolutely terrified at the\r\nsight of her. To my relief, the paroxysm left her as suddenly as it had\r\ncome. She thrust away the tuft of grass into the bosom of her dress,\r\nand took my arm and hurried with me out of the churchyard. I asked her\r\nwhy she had gone back\xe2\x80\x94I asked what those words were which she had\r\nspoken at the grave. \xe2\x80\x98A promise to our dead father,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, with\r\na momentary return of the wild look and the frenzied manner which had\r\nstartled me already. I was afraid to agitate her by saying more; I left\r\nall other questions to be asked at a fitter and a quieter time. You\r\nwill understand from this how terribly she suffers, how wildly and\r\nstrangely she acts under violent agitation; and you will not interpret\r\nagainst her what she said or did when you saw her on Wednesday last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe only returned to the house in time to hasten away from it to the\r\ntrain. Perhaps it was better for us so\xe2\x80\x94better that we had only a moment\r\nleft to look back before the turn in the road hid the last of\r\nCombe-Raven from our view. There was not a soul we knew at the station;\r\nnobody to stare at us, nobody to wish us good-by. The rain came on\r\nagain as we took our seats in the train. What we felt at the sight of\r\nthe railway\xe2\x80\x94what horrible remembrances it forced on our minds of the\r\ncalamity which has made us fatherless\xe2\x80\x94I cannot, and dare not, tell you.\r\nI have tried anxiously not to write this letter in a gloomy tone; not\r\nto return all your kindness to us by distressing you with our grief.\r\nPerhaps I have dwelt too long already on the little story of our\r\nparting from home? I can only say, in excuse, that my heart is full of\r\nit; and what is not in my heart my pen won\xe2\x80\x99t write.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been so short a time in our new abode that I have nothing more\r\nto tell you\xe2\x80\x94except that Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s sister has received us with the\r\nheartiest kindness. She considerately leaves us to ourselves, until we\r\nare fitter than we are now to think of our future plans, and to arrange\r\nas we best can for earning our own living. The house is so large, and\r\nthe position of our rooms has been so thoughtfully chosen, that I\r\nshould hardly know\xe2\x80\x94except when I hear the laughing of the younger girls\r\nin the garden\xe2\x80\x94that we were living in a school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith kindest and best wishes from Miss Garth and my sister, believe\r\nme, dear Mr. Pendril, gratefully yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNORAH VANSTONE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nFrom Miss Garth to Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWestmoreland House, Kensington,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeptember 23d, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR SIR,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write these lines in such misery of mind as no words can describe.\r\nMagdalen has deserted us. At an early hour this morning she secretly\r\nleft the house, and she has not been heard of since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would come and speak to you personally; but I dare not leave Norah.\r\nI must try to control myself; I must try to write.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing happened yesterday to prepare me or to prepare Norah for this\r\nlast\xe2\x80\x94I had almost said, this worst\xe2\x80\x94of all our afflictions. The only\r\nalteration we either of us noticed in the unhappy girl was an\r\nalteration for the better when we parted for the night. She kissed me,\r\nwhich she has not done latterly; and she burst out crying when she\r\nembraced her sister next. We had so little suspicion of the truth that\r\nwe thought these signs of renewed tenderness and affection a promise of\r\nbetter things for the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning, when her sister went into her room, it was empty, and a\r\nnote in her handwriting, addressed to Norah, was lying on the\r\ndressing-table. I cannot prevail on Norah to part with the note; I can\r\nonly send you the inclosed copy of it. You will see that it affords no\r\nclue to the direction she has taken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowing the value of time, in this dreadful emergency, I examined her\r\nroom, and (with my sister\xe2\x80\x99s help) questioned the servants immediately\r\non the news of her absence reaching me. Her wardrobe was empty; and all\r\nher boxes but one, which she has evidently taken away with her, are\r\nempty, too. We are of opinion that she has privately turned her dresses\r\nand jewelry into money; that she had the one trunk she took with her\r\nremoved from the house yesterday; and that she left us this morning on\r\nfoot. The answers given by one of the servants are so unsatisfactory\r\nthat we believe the woman has been bribed to assist her; and has\r\nmanaged all those arrangements for her flight which she could not have\r\nsafely undertaken by herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the immediate object with which she has left us, I entertain no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reasons (which I can tell you at a fitter time) for feeling\r\nassured that she has gone away with the intention of trying her fortune\r\non the stage. She has in her possession the card of an actor by\r\nprofession, who superintended an amateur theatrical performance at\r\nClifton, in which she took part; and to him she has gone to help her. I\r\nsaw the card at the time, and I know the actor\xe2\x80\x99s name to be Huxtable.\r\nThe address I cannot call to mind quite so correctly; but I am almost\r\nsure it was at some theatrical place in Bow Street, Covent Garden. Let\r\nme entreat you not to lose a moment in sending to make the necessary\r\ninquiries; the first trace of her will, I firmly believe, be found at\r\nthat address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we had nothing worse to dread than her attempting to go on the\r\nstage, I should not feel the distress and dismay which now overpower\r\nme. Hundreds of other girls have acted as recklessly as she has acted,\r\nand have not ended ill after all. But my fears for Magdalen do not\r\nbegin and end with the risk she is running at present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been something weighing on her mind ever since we left\r\nCombe-Raven\xe2\x80\x94weighing far more heavily for the last six weeks than at\r\nfirst. Until the period when Francis Clare left England, I am persuaded\r\nshe was secretly sustained by the hope that he would contrive to see\r\nher again. From the day when she knew that the measures you had taken\r\nfor preventing this had succeeded; from the day when she was assured\r\nthat the ship had really taken him away, nothing has roused, nothing\r\nhas interested her. She has given herself up, more and more hopelessly,\r\nto her own brooding thoughts; thoughts which I believe first entered\r\nher mind on the day when the utter ruin of the prospects on which her\r\nmarriage depended was made known to her. She has formed some desperate\r\nproject of contesting the possession of her father\xe2\x80\x99s fortune with\r\nMichael Vanstone; and the stage career which she has gone away to try\r\nis nothing more than a means of freeing herself from all home\r\ndependence, and of enabling her to run what mad risks she pleases, in\r\nperfect security from all home control. What it costs me to write of\r\nher in these terms, I must leave you to imagine. The time has gone by\r\nwhen any consideration of distress to my own feelings can weigh with\r\nme. Whatever I can say which will open your eyes to the real danger,\r\nand strengthen your conviction of the instant necessity of averting it,\r\nI say in despite of myself, without hesitation and without reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more, and I have done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time you were so good as to come to this house, do you\r\nremember how Magdalen embarrassed and distressed us by questioning you\r\nabout her right to bear her father\xe2\x80\x99s name? Do you remember her\r\npersisting in her inquiries, until she had forced you to acknowledge\r\nthat, legally speaking, she and her sister had No Name? I venture to\r\nremind you of this, because you have the affairs of hundreds of clients\r\nto think of, and you might well have forgotten the circumstance.\r\nWhatever natural reluctance she might otherwise have had to deceiving\r\nus, and degrading herself, by the use of an assumed name, that\r\nconversation with you is certain to have removed. We must discover her\r\nby personal description\xe2\x80\x94we can trace her in no other way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can think of nothing more to guide your decision in our deplorable\r\nemergency. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let no expense and no efforts be spared. My\r\nletter ought to reach you by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning, at the latest.\r\nLet me have one line in answer, to say you will act instantly for the\r\nbest. My only hope of quieting Norah is to show her a word of\r\nencouragement from your pen. Believe me, dear sir, yours sincerely and\r\nobliged,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHARRIET GARTH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nFrom Magdalen to Norah (inclosed in the preceding Letter).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DARLING,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to forgive me. I have struggled against myself till I am worn out\r\nin the effort. I am the wretchedest of living creatures. Our quiet life\r\nhere maddens me; I can bear it no longer; I must go. If you knew what\r\nmy thoughts are; if you knew how hard I have fought against them, and\r\nhow horribly they have gone on haunting me in the lonely quiet of this\r\nhouse, you would pity and forgive me. Oh, my love, don\xe2\x80\x99t feel hurt at\r\nmy not opening my heart to you as I ought! I dare not open it. I dare\r\nnot show myself to you as I really am.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t send and seek after me; I will write and relieve all your\r\nanxieties. You know, Norah, we must get our living for ourselves; I\r\nhave only gone to get mine in the manner which is fittest for me.\r\nWhether I succeed, or whether I fail, I can do myself no harm either\r\nway. I have no position to lose, and no name to degrade. Don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt I\r\nlove you\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let Miss Garth doubt my gratitude. I go away miserable\r\nat leaving you; but I must go. If I had loved you less dearly, I might\r\nhave had the courage to say this in your presence\xe2\x80\x94but how could I trust\r\nmyself to resist your persuasions, and to bear the sight of your\r\ndistress? Farewell, my darling! Take a thousand kisses from me, my own\r\nbest, dearest love, till we meet again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAGDALEN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nFrom Sergeant Bulmer (of the Detective Police) to Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScotland Yard,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeptember 29th, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour clerk informs me that the parties interested in our inquiry after\r\nthe missing young lady are anxious for news of the same. I went to your\r\noffice to speak to you about the matter to-day. Not having found you,\r\nand not being able to return and try again to-morrow, I write these\r\nlines to save delay, and to tell you how we stand thus far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say, no advance has been made since my former report.\r\nThe trace of the young lady which we found nearly a week since, still\r\nremains the last trace discovered of her. This case seems a mighty\r\nsimple one looked at from a distance. Looked at close, it alters very\r\nconsiderably for the worse, and becomes, to speak the plain truth\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nPoser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is how we now stand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have traced the young lady to the theatrical agent\xe2\x80\x99s in Bow Street.\r\nWe know that at an early hour on the morning of the twenty-third the\r\nagent was called downstairs, while he was dressing, to speak to a young\r\nlady in a cab at the door. We know that, on her production of Mr.\r\nHuxtable\xe2\x80\x99s card, he wrote on it Mr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s address in the country,\r\nand heard her order the cabman to drive to the Great Northern terminus.\r\nWe believe she left by the nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock train. We followed her by the\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock train. We have ascertained that she called at half-past\r\ntwo at Mr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings; that she found he was away, and not\r\nexpected back till eight in the evening; that she left word she would\r\ncall again at eight; and that she never returned. Mr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstatement is\xe2\x80\x94he and the young lady have never set eyes on each other.\r\nThe first consideration which follows, is this: Are we to believe Mr.\r\nHuxtable? I have carefully inquired into his character; I know as much,\r\nor more, about him than he knows about himself; and my opinion is, that\r\nwe _are_ to believe him. To the best of my knowledge, he is a perfectly\r\nhonest man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, then, is the hitch in the case. The young lady sets out with a\r\ncertain object before her. Instead of going on to the accomplishment of\r\nthat object, she stops short of it. Why has she stopped? and where?\r\nThose are, unfortunately, just the questions which we can\xe2\x80\x99t answer yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own opinion of the matter is, briefly, as follows: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nshe has met with any serious accident. Serious accidents, in nine cases\r\nout of ten, discover themselves. My own notion is, that she has fallen\r\ninto the hands of some person or persons interested in hiding her away,\r\nand sharp enough to know how to set about it. Whether she is in their\r\ncharge, with or without her own consent, is more than I can undertake\r\nto say at present. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to raise false hopes or false fears; I\r\nwish to stop short at the opinion I have given already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn regard to the future, I may tell you that I have left one of my men\r\nin daily communication with the authorities. I have also taken care to\r\nhave the handbills offering a reward for the discovery of her widely\r\ncirculated. Lastly, I have completed the necessary arrangements for\r\nseeing the play-bills of all country theaters, and for having the\r\ndramatic companies well looked after. Some years since, this would have\r\ncost a serious expenditure of time and money. Luckily for our purpose,\r\nthe country theaters are in a bad way. Excepting the large cities,\r\nhardly one of them is open, and we can keep our eye on them, with\r\nlittle expense and less difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the steps which I think it needful to take at present. If\r\nyou are of another opinion, you have only to give me your directions,\r\nand I will carefully attend to the same. I don\xe2\x80\x99t by any means despair\r\nof our finding the young lady and bringing her back to her friends safe\r\nand well. Please to tell them so; and allow me to subscribe myself,\r\nyours respectfully,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cABRAHAM BULMER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nAnonymous Letter addressed to Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA word to the wise. The friends of a certain young lady are wasting\r\ntime and money to no purpose. Your confidential clerk and your\r\ndetective policeman are looking for a needle in a bottle of hay. This\r\nis the ninth of October, and they have not found her yet: they will as\r\nsoon find the Northwest Passage. Call your dogs off; and you may hear\r\nof the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s safety under her own hand. The longer you look for\r\nher, the longer she will remain, what she is now\xe2\x80\x94lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[The preceding letter is thus indorsed, in Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo apparent means of tracing the inclosed to its source.

The\r\npostern by which Skeldergate was formerly approached no longer exists;\r\nand the few old houses left in the street are disguised in melancholy\r\nmodern costume of whitewash and cement. Shops of the smaller and poorer\r\norder, intermixed here and there with dingy warehouses and joyless\r\nprivate residences of red brick, compose the present aspect of\r\nSkeldergate. On the river-side the houses are separated at intervals by\r\nlanes running down to the water, and disclosing lonely little plots of\r\nopen ground, with the masts of sailing-barges rising beyond. At its\r\nsouthward extremity the street ceases on a sudden, and the broad flow\r\nof the Ouse, the trees, the meadows, the public-walk on one bank and\r\nthe towing-path on the other, open to view.\r\n\r\nHere, where the street ends, and on the side of it furthest from the\r\nriver, a narrow little lane leads up to the paved footway surmounting\r\nthe ancient Walls of York. The one small row of buildings, which is all\r\nthat the lane possesses, is composed of cheap lodging-houses, with an\r\nopposite view, at the distance of a few feet, of a portion of the\r\nmassive city wall. This place is called Rosemary Lane. Very little\r\nlight enters it; very few people live in it; the floating population of\r\nSkeldergate passes it by; and visitors to the Walk on the Walls, who\r\nuse it as the way up or the way down, get out of the dreary little\r\npassage as fast as they can.\r\n\r\nThe door of one of the houses in this lost corner of York opened softly\r\non the evening of the twenty-third of September, eighteen hundred and\r\nforty-six; and a solitary individual of the male sex sauntered into\r\nSkeldergate from the seclusion of Rosemary Lane.\r\n\r\nTurning northward, this person directed his steps toward the bridge\r\nover the Ouse and the busy center of the city. He bore the external\r\nappearance of respectable poverty; he carried a gingham umbrella,\r\npreserved in an oilskin case; he picked his steps, with the neatest\r\navoidance of all dirty places on the pavement; and he surveyed the\r\nscene around him with eyes of two different colors\xe2\x80\x94a bilious brown eye\r\non the lookout for employment, and a bilious green eye in a similar\r\npredicament. In plainer terms, the stranger from Rosemary Lane was no\r\nother than\xe2\x80\x94Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\nOutwardly speaking, the captain had not altered for the better since\r\nthe memorable spring day when he had presented himself to Miss Garth at\r\nthe lodge-gate at Combe-Raven. The railway mania of that famous year\r\nhad attacked even the wary Wragge; had withdrawn him from his customary\r\npursuits; and had left him prostrate in the end, like many a better\r\nman. He had lost his clerical appearance\xe2\x80\x94he had faded with the autumn\r\nleaves. His crape hat-band had put itself in brown mourning for its own\r\nbereavement of black. His dingy white collar and cravat had died the\r\ndeath of old linen, and had gone to their long home at the\r\npaper-maker\xe2\x80\x99s, to live again one day in quires at a stationer\xe2\x80\x99s shop. A\r\ngray shooting-jacket in the last stage of woolen atrophy replaced the\r\nblack frockcoat of former times, and, like a faithful servant, kept the\r\ndark secret of its master\xe2\x80\x99s linen from the eyes of a prying world. From\r\ntop to toe every square inch of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s clothing was altered for\r\nthe worse; but the man himself remained unchanged\xe2\x80\x94superior to all forms\r\nof moral mildew, impervious to the action of social rust. He was as\r\ncourteous, as persuasive, as blandly dignified as ever. He carried his\r\nhead as high without a shirt-collar as ever he had carried it with one.\r\nThe threadbare black handkerchief round his neck was perfectly tied;\r\nhis rotten old shoes were neatly blacked; he might have compared chins,\r\nin the matter of smooth shaving, with the highest church dignitary in\r\nYork. Time, change, and poverty had all attacked the captain together,\r\nand had all failed alike to get him down on the ground. He paced the\r\nstreets of York, a man superior to clothes and circumstances\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nvagabond varnish as bright on him as ever.\r\n\r\nArrived at the bridge, Captain Wragge stopped and looked idly over the\r\nparapet at the barges in the river. It was plainly evident that he had\r\nno particular destination to reach and nothing whatever to do. While he\r\nwas still loitering, the clock of York Minster chimed the half-hour\r\npast five. Cabs rattled by him over the bridge on their way to meet the\r\ntrain from London, at twenty minutes to six. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation, the captain sauntered after the cabs. When it is one of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s regular habits to live upon his fellow-creatures, that man is\r\nalways more or less fond of haunting large railway stations. Captain\r\nWragge gleaned the human field, and on that unoccupied afternoon the\r\nYork terminus was as likely a corner to look about in as any other.\r\n\r\nHe reached the platform a few minutes after the train had arrived. That\r\nentire incapability of devising administrative measures for the\r\nmanagement of large crowds, which is one of the characteristics of\r\nEnglishmen in authority, is nowhere more strikingly exemplified than at\r\nYork. Three different lines of railway assemble three passenger mobs,\r\nfrom morning to-night, under one roof; and leave them to raise a\r\ntraveler\xe2\x80\x99s riot, with all the assistance which the bewildered servants\r\nof the company can render to increase the confusion. The customary\r\ndisturbance was rising to its climax as Captain Wragge approached the\r\nplatform. Dozens of different people were trying to attain dozens of\r\ndifferent objects, in dozens of different directions, all starting from\r\nthe same common point and all equally deprived of the means of\r\ninformation. A sudden parting of the crowd, near the second-class\r\ncarriages, attracted the captain\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity. He pushed his way in; and\r\nfound a decently-dressed man\xe2\x80\x94assisted by a porter and a\r\npoliceman\xe2\x80\x94attempting to pick up some printed bills scattered from a\r\npaper parcel, which his frenzied fellow-passengers had knocked out of\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nOffering his assistance in this emergency, with the polite alacrity\r\nwhich marked his character, Captain Wragge observed the three startling\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cFifty Pounds Reward,\xe2\x80\x9d printed in capital letters on the bills\r\nwhich he assisted in recovering; and instantly secreted one of them, to\r\nbe more closely examined at the first convenient opportunity. As he\r\ncrumpled up the bill in the palm of his hand, his party-colored eyes\r\nfixed with hungry interest on the proprietor of the unlucky parcel.\r\nWhen a man happens not to be possessed of fifty pence in his own\r\npocket, if his heart is in the right place, it bounds; if his mouth is\r\nproperly constituted, it waters, at the sight of another man who\r\ncarries about with him a printed offer of fifty pounds sterling,\r\naddressed to his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate traveler wrapped up his parcel as he best might, and\r\nmade his way off the platform, after addressing an inquiry to the first\r\nofficial victim of the day\xe2\x80\x99s passenger-traffic, who was sufficiently in\r\npossession of his senses to listen to it. Leaving the station for the\r\nriver-side, which was close at hand, the stranger entered the ferryboat\r\nat the North Street Postern. The captain, who had carefully dogged his\r\nsteps thus far, entered the boat also; and employed the short interval\r\nof transit to the opposite bank in a perusal of the handbill which he\r\nhad kept for his own private enlightenment. With his back carefully\r\nturned on the traveler, Captain Wragge now possessed his mind of the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFIFTY POUNDS REWARD.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft her home, in London, early on the morning of September 23d, 1846,\r\nA YOUNG LADY. Age\xe2\x80\x94eighteen. Dress\xe2\x80\x94deep mourning. Personal\r\nappearance\xe2\x80\x94hair of a very light brown; eyebrows and eyelashes darker;\r\neyes light gray; complexion strikingly pale; lower part of her face\r\nlarge and full; tall upright figure; walks with remarkable grace and\r\nease; speaks with openness and resolution; has the manners and habits\r\nof a refined, cultivated lady. Personal marks\xe2\x80\x94two little moles, close\r\ntogether, on the left side of the neck. Mark on the\r\nunder-clothing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Magdalen Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x99 Is supposed to have joined, or\r\nattempted to join, under an assumed name, a theatrical company now\r\nperforming at York. Had, when she left London, one black box, and no\r\nother luggage. Whoever will give such information as will restore her\r\nto her friends shall receive the above Reward. Apply at the office of\r\nMr. Harkness, solicitor, Coney Street, York. Or to Messrs. Wyatt,\r\nPendril, and Gwilt, Serle Street, Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccustomed as Captain Wragge was to keep the completest possession of\r\nhimself in all human emergencies, his own profound astonishment, when\r\nthe course of his reading brought him to the mark on the linen of the\r\nmissing young lady, betrayed him into an exclamation of surprise which\r\neven startled the ferryman. The traveler was less observant; his whole\r\nattention was fixed on the opposite bank of the river, and he left the\r\nboat hastily the moment it touched the landing-place. Captain Wragge\r\nrecovered himself, pocketed the handbill, and followed his leader for\r\nthe second time.\r\n\r\nThe stranger directed his steps to the nearest street which ran down to\r\nthe river, compared a note in his pocketbook with the numbers of the\r\nhouses on the left-hand side, stopped at one of them, and rang the\r\nbell. The captain went on to the next house; affected to ring the bell,\r\nin his turn, and stood with his back to the traveler\xe2\x80\x94in appearance,\r\nwaiting to be let in; in reality, listening with all his might for any\r\nscraps of dialogue which might reach his ears on the opening of the\r\ndoor behind him.\r\n\r\nThe door was answered with all due alacrity, and a sufficiently\r\ninstructive interchange of question and answer on the threshold\r\nrewarded the dexterity of Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Mr. Huxtable live here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the traveler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at home now, sir; but he will be in again at eight to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think a young lady called here early in the day, did she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a young lady came this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly; I come on the same business. Did she see Mr. Huxtable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; he has been away all day. The young lady told me she would\r\ncome back at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so. I will call and see Mr. Huxtable at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny name, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; say a gentleman called on theatrical business\xe2\x80\x94that will be enough.\r\nWait one minute, if you please. I am a stranger in York; will you\r\nkindly tell me which is the way to Coney Street?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman gave the required information, the door closed, and the\r\nstranger hastened away in the direction of Coney Street.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Captain Wragge made no attempt to follow him. The\r\nhandbill revealed plainly enough that the man\xe2\x80\x99s next object was to\r\ncomplete the necessary arrangements with the local solicitor on the\r\nsubject of the promised reward.\r\n\r\nHaving seen and heard enough for his immediate purpose, the captain\r\nretraced his steps down the street, turned to the right, and entered on\r\nthe Esplanade, which, in that quarter of the city, borders the\r\nriver-side between the swimming-baths and Lendal Tower. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a\r\nfamily matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge to himself, persisting, from sheer\r\nforce of habit, in the old assertion of his relationship to Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother; \xe2\x80\x9cI must consider it in all its bearings.\xe2\x80\x9d He tucked the\r\numbrella under his arm, crossed his hands behind him, and lowered\r\nhimself gently into the abyss of his own reflections. The order and\r\npropriety observable in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s shabby garments accurately\r\ntypified the order and propriety which distinguished the operations of\r\nthe captain\xe2\x80\x99s mind. It was his habit always to see his way before him\r\nthrough a neat succession of alternatives\xe2\x80\x94and so he saw it now.\r\n\r\nThree courses were open to him in connection with the remarkable\r\ndiscovery which he had just made. The first course was to do nothing in\r\nthe matter at all. Inadmissible, on family grounds: equally\r\ninadmissible on pecuniary grounds: rejected accordingly. The second\r\ncourse was to deserve the gratitude of the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s friends, rated\r\nat fifty pounds. The third course was, by a timely warning to deserve\r\nthe gratitude of the young lady herself, rated\xe2\x80\x94at an unknown figure.\r\nBetween these two last alternatives the wary Wragge hesitated; not from\r\ndoubt of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s pecuniary resources\xe2\x80\x94for he was totally ignorant of\r\nthe circumstances which had deprived the sisters of their\r\ninheritance\xe2\x80\x94but from doubt whether an obstacle in the shape of an\r\nundiscovered gentleman might not be privately connected with her\r\ndisappearance from home. After mature reflection, he determined to\r\npause, and be guided by circumstances. In the meantime, the first\r\nconsideration was to be beforehand with the messenger from London, and\r\nto lay hands securely on the young lady herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel for this misguided girl,\xe2\x80\x9d mused the captain, solemnly strutting\r\nbackward and forward by the lonely river-side. \xe2\x80\x9cI always have looked\r\nupon her\xe2\x80\x94I always shall look upon her\xe2\x80\x94in the light of a niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhere was the adopted relative at that moment? In other words, how was\r\na young lady in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s critical position likely to while away the\r\nhours until Mr. Huxtable \xe2\x80\x98s return? If there was an obstructive\r\ngentleman in the background, it would be mere waste of time to pursue\r\nthe question. But if the inference which the handbill suggested was\r\ncorrect\xe2\x80\x94if she was really alone at that moment in the city of\r\nYork\xe2\x80\x94where was she likely to be?\r\n\r\nNot in the crowded thoroughfares, to begin with. Not viewing the\r\nobjects of interest in the Minster, for it was now past the hour at\r\nwhich the cathedral could be seen. Was she in the waiting-room at the\r\nrailway? She would hardly run that risk. Was she in one of the hotels?\r\nDoubtful, considering that she was entirely by herself. In a\r\npastry-cook\xe2\x80\x99s shop? Far more likely. Driving about in a cab? Possible,\r\ncertainly; but no more. Loitering away the time in some quiet locality,\r\nout-of-doors? Likely enough, again, on that fine autumn evening. The\r\ncaptain paused, weighed the relative claims on his attention of the\r\nquiet locality and the pastry-cook\xe2\x80\x99s shop; and decided for the first of\r\nthe two. There was time enough to find her at the pastry-cook\xe2\x80\x99s, to\r\ninquire after her at the principal hotels, or, finally, to intercept\r\nher in Mr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s immediate neighborhood from seven to eight. While\r\nthe light lasted, the wise course was to use it in looking for her\r\nout-of-doors. Where? The Esplanade was a quiet locality; but she was\r\nnot there\xe2\x80\x94not on the lonely road beyond, which ran back by the Abbey\r\nWall. Where next? The captain stopped, looked across the river,\r\nbrightened under the influence of a new idea, and suddenly hastened\r\nback to the ferry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Walk on the Walls,\xe2\x80\x9d thought this judicious man, with a twinkle of\r\nhis party-colored eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe quietest place in York; and the place that\r\nevery stranger goes to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes more Captain Wragge was exploring the new field of\r\nsearch. He mounted to the walls (which inclose the whole western\r\nportion of the city) by the North Street Postern, from which the walk\r\nwinds round until it ends again at its southernly extremity in the\r\nnarrow passage of Rosemary Lane. It was then twenty minutes to seven.\r\nThe sun had set more than half an hour since; the red light lay broad\r\nand low in the cloudless western heaven; all visible objects were\r\nsoftening in the tender twilight, but were not darkening yet. The first\r\nfew lamps lit in the street below looked like faint little specks of\r\nyellow light, as the captain started on his walk through one of the\r\nmost striking scenes which England can show.\r\n\r\nOn his right hand, as he set forth, stretched the open country beyond\r\nthe walls\xe2\x80\x94the rich green meadows, the boundary-trees dividing them, the\r\nbroad windings of the river in the distance, the scattered buildings\r\nnearer to view; all wrapped in the evening stillness, all made\r\nbeautiful by the evening peace. On his left hand, the majestic west\r\nfront of York Minster soared over the city and caught the last\r\nbrightest light of heaven on the summits of its lofty towers. Had this\r\nnoble prospect tempted the lost girl to linger and look at it? No; thus\r\nfar, not a sign of her. The captain looked round him attentively, and\r\nwalked on.\r\n\r\nHe reached the spot where the iron course of the railroad strikes its\r\nway through arches in the old wall. He paused at this place\xe2\x80\x94where the\r\ncentral activity of a great railway enterprise beats, with all the\r\npulses of its loud-clanging life, side by side with the dead majesty of\r\nthe past, deep under the old historic stones which tell of fortified\r\nYork and the sieges of two centuries since\xe2\x80\x94he stood on this spot, and\r\nsearched for her again, and searched in vain. Others were looking idly\r\ndown at the desolate activity on the wilderness of the iron rails; but\r\nshe was not among them. The captain glanced doubtfully at the darkening\r\nsky, and walked on.\r\n\r\nHe stopped again where the postern of Micklegate still stands, and\r\nstill strengthens the city wall as of old. Here the paved walk descends\r\na few steps, passes through the dark stone guardroom of the ancient\r\ngate, ascends again, and continues its course southward until the walls\r\nreach the river once more. He paused, and peered anxiously into the dim\r\ninner corners of the old guard-room. Was she waiting there for the\r\ndarkness to come, and hide her from prying eyes? No: a solitary workman\r\nloitered through the stone chamber; but no other living creature\r\nstirred in the place. The captain mounted the steps which led out from\r\nthe postern and walked on.\r\n\r\nHe advanced some fifty or sixty yards along the paved footway; the\r\noutlying suburbs of York on one side of him, a rope-walk and some\r\npatches of kitchen garden occupying a vacant strip of ground on the\r\nother. He advanced with eager eyes and quickened step; for he saw\r\nbefore him the lonely figure of a woman, standing by the parapet of the\r\nwall, with her face set toward the westward view. He approached\r\ncautiously, to make sure of her before she turned and observed him.\r\nThere was no mistaking that tall, dark figure, as it rested against the\r\nparapet with a listless grace. There she stood, in her long black cloak\r\nand gown, the last dim light of evening falling tenderly on her pale,\r\nresolute young face. There she stood\xe2\x80\x94not three months since the spoiled\r\ndarling of her parents; the priceless treasure of the household, never\r\nleft unprotected, never trusted alone\xe2\x80\x94there she stood in the lovely\r\ndawn of her womanhood, a castaway in a strange city, wrecked on the\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nVagabond as he was, the first sight of her staggered even the dauntless\r\nassurance of Captain Wragge. As she slowly turned her face and looked\r\nat him, he raised his hat, with the nearest approach to respect which a\r\nlong life of unblushing audacity had left him capable of making.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I have the honor of addressing the younger Miss Vanstone?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nbegan. \xe2\x80\x9cDeeply gratified, I am sure\xe2\x80\x94for more reasons than one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a cold surprise. No recollection of the day when\r\nhe had followed her sister and herself on their way home with Miss\r\nGarth rose in her memory, while he now confronted her, with his altered\r\nmanner and his altered dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a perfect stranger to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain; \xe2\x80\x9cI am a species of relation. I had\r\nthe pleasure of seeing you in the spring of the present year. I\r\npresented myself on that memorable occasion to an honored preceptress\r\nin your late father\xe2\x80\x99s family. Permit me, under equally agreeable\r\ncircumstances, to present myself to _you_. My name is Wragge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time he had recovered complete possession of his own impudence;\r\nhis party-colored eyes twinkled cheerfully, and he accompanied his\r\nmodest announcement of himself with a dancing-master\xe2\x80\x99s bow.\r\n\r\nMagdalen frowned, and drew back a step. The captain was not a man to be\r\ndaunted by a cold reception. He tucked his umbrella under his arm and\r\njocosely spelled his name for her further enlightenment. \xe2\x80\x9cW, R, A,\r\ndouble G, E\xe2\x80\x94Wragge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, ticking off the letters\r\npersuasively on his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember your name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me for leaving you\r\nabruptly. I have an engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to pass him and walk on northward toward the railway. He\r\ninstantly met the attempt by raising both hands, and displaying a pair\r\nof darned black gloves outspread in polite protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cnot that way, Miss Vanstone, I beg and\r\nentreat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the way which leads to Mr.\r\nHuxtable\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the ungovernable astonishment of hearing his reply she suddenly bent\r\nforward, and for the first time looked him close in the face. He\r\nsustained her suspicious scrutiny with every appearance of feeling\r\nhighly gratified by it. \xe2\x80\x9cH, U, X\xe2\x80\x94Hux,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, playfully\r\nturning to the old joke: \xe2\x80\x9cT, A\xe2\x80\x94ta, Huxta; B, L, E\xe2\x80\x94ble; Huxtable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about Mr. Huxtable?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by\r\nmentioning him to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s curly lip took a new twist upward. He immediately\r\nreplied, to the best practical purpose, by producing the handbill from\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is just light enough left,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor young (and lovely)\r\neyes to read by. Before I enter upon the personal statement which your\r\nflattering inquiry claims from me, pray bestow a moment\xe2\x80\x99s attention on\r\nthis Document.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the handbill from him. By the last gleam of twilight she read\r\nthe lines which set a price on her recovery\xe2\x80\x94which published the\r\ndescription of her in pitiless print, like the description of a strayed\r\ndog. No tender consideration had prepared her for the shock, no kind\r\nword softened it to her when it came. The vagabond, whose cunning eyes\r\nwatched her eagerly while she read, knew no more that the handbill\r\nwhich he had stolen had only been prepared in anticipation of the\r\nworst, and was only to be publicly used in the event of all more\r\nconsiderate means of tracing her being tried in vain\xe2\x80\x94than she knew it.\r\nThe bill dropped from her hand; her face flushed deeply. She turned\r\naway from Captain Wragge, as if all idea of his existence had passed\r\nout of her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Norah, Norah!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, sorrowfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the letter\r\nI wrote you\xe2\x80\x94after the hard struggle I had to go away! Oh, Norah,\r\nNorah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Norah?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the captain, with the utmost politeness.\r\n\r\nShe turned upon him with an angry brightness in her large gray eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this thing shown publicly?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, stamping her foot on it. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthe mark on my neck described all over York?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray compose yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the persuasive Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cAt present I\r\nhave every reason to believe that you have just perused the only copy\r\nin circulation. Allow me to pick it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he could touch the bill she snatched it from the pavement, tore\r\nit into fragments, and threw them over the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remind me of your poor dear mother.\r\nThe family spirit, Miss Vanstone. We all inherit our hot blood from my\r\nmaternal grandfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come by it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear creature, I have just told you,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nall come by it from my maternal grandfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come by that handbill?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg ten thousand pardons! My head was running on the family\r\nspirit.\xe2\x80\x94How did I come by it? Briefly thus.\xe2\x80\x9d Here Captain Wragge\r\nentered on his personal statement; taking his customary vocal exercise\r\nthrough the longest words of the English language, with the highest\r\nelocutionary relish. Having, on this rare occasion, nothing to gain by\r\nconcealment, he departed from his ordinary habits, and, with the utmost\r\namazement at the novelty of his own situation, permitted himself to\r\ntell the unmitigated truth.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the narrative on Magdalen by no means fulfilled Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x99s anticipations in relating it. She was not startled; she was\r\nnot irritated; she showed no disposition to cast herself on his mercy,\r\nand to seek his advice. She looked him steadily in the face; and all\r\nshe said, when he had neatly rounded his last sentence, was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cShocked to disappoint you, I am sure;\r\nbut the fact is, I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you have not,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have left out the end of your\r\nstory. The end of it is, you came here to look for me; and you mean to\r\nearn the fifty pounds reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose plain words so completely staggered Captain Wragge that for the\r\nmoment he stood speechless. But he had faced awkward truths of all\r\nsorts far too often to be permanently disconcerted by them. Before\r\nMagdalen could pursue her advantage, the vagabond had recovered his\r\nbalance: Wragge was himself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, laughing indulgently, and drumming with his\r\numbrella on the pavement. \xe2\x80\x9cSome men might take it seriously. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\neasily offended. Try again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen looked at him through the gathering darkness in mute\r\nperplexity. All her little experience of society had been experience\r\namong people who possessed a common sense of honor, and a common\r\nresponsibility of social position. She had hitherto seen nothing but\r\nthe successful human product from the great manufactory of\r\nCivilization. Here was one of the failures, and, with all her\r\nquickness, she was puzzled how to deal with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for returning to the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has\r\njust occurred to my mind that you might actually have spoken in\r\nearnest. My poor child! how can I earn the fifty pounds before the\r\nreward is offered to me? Those handbills may not be publicly posted for\r\na week to come. Precious as you are to all your relatives (myself\r\nincluded), take my word for it, the lawyers who are managing this case\r\nwill not pay fifty pounds for you if they can possibly help it. Are you\r\nstill persuaded that my needy pockets are gaping for the money? Very\r\ngood. Button them up in spite of me with your own fair fingers. There\r\nis a train to London at nine forty-five to-night. Submit yourself to\r\nyour friend\xe2\x80\x99s wishes and go back by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, firing at the bare suggestion, exactly as the\r\ncaptain had intended she should. \xe2\x80\x9cIf my mind had not been made up\r\nbefore, that vile handbill would have decided me. I forgive Norah,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, turning away and speaking to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not Mr. Pendril, and\r\nnot Miss Garth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cThe family spirit. I should have\r\ndone the same myself at your age. It runs in the blood. Hark! there\r\ngoes the clock again\xe2\x80\x94half-past seven. Miss Vanstone, pardon this\r\nseasonable abruptness! If you are to carry out your resolution\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\nare to be your own mistress much longer, you must take a course of some\r\nkind before eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. You are young, you are inexperienced, you\r\nare in imminent danger. Here is a position of emergency on one side\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhere am I, on the other, with an uncle\xe2\x80\x99s interest in you, full of\r\nadvice. Tap me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I choose to depend on nobody, and to act for myself?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMagdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will walk straight into one of the\r\nfour traps which are set to catch you in the ancient and interesting\r\ncity of York. Trap the first, at Mr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s house; trap the second,\r\nat all the hotels; trap the third, at the railway station; trap the\r\nfourth, at the theater. That man with the handbills has had an hour at\r\nhis disposal. If he has not set those four traps (with the assistance\r\nof the local solicitor) by this time, he is not the competent lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclerk I take him for. Come, come, my dear girl! if there is somebody\r\nelse in the background, whose advice you prefer to mine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see that I am alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed, proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew me\r\nbetter, you would know that I depend on nobody but myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words decided the only doubt which now remained in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94the doubt whether the course was clear before him. The motive of\r\nher flight from home was evidently what the handbills assumed it to\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94a reckless fancy for going on the stage. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of two things,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought Wragge to himself, in his logical way. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s worth more than\r\nfifty pounds to me in her present situation, or she isn\xe2\x80\x99t. If she is,\r\nher friends may whistle for her. If she isn\xe2\x80\x99t, I have only to keep her\r\ntill the bills are posted.\xe2\x80\x9d Fortified by this simple plan of action,\r\nthe captain returned to the charge, and politely placed Magdalen\r\nbetween the two inevitable alternatives of trusting herself to him, on\r\nthe one hand, or of returning to her friends, on the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI respect independence of character wherever I find it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with\r\nan air of virtuous severity. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a young and lovely relative, I more\r\nthan respect\xe2\x80\x94I admire it. But (excuse the bold assertion), to walk on a\r\nway of your own, you must first have a way to walk on. Under existing\r\ncircumstances, where is _your_ way? Mr. Huxtable is out of the\r\nquestion, to begin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the question for to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what hinders me\r\nfrom writing to Mr. Huxtable, and making my own private arrangements\r\nwith him for to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted with all my heart\xe2\x80\x94a hit, a palpable hit. Now for my turn. To\r\nget to to-morrow (excuse the bold assertion, once more), you must first\r\npass through to-night. Where are you to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there no hotels in York?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent hotels for large families; excellent hotels for single\r\ngentlemen. The very worst hotels in the world for handsome young ladies\r\nwho present themselves alone at the door without male escort, without a\r\nmaid in attendance, and without a single article of luggage. Dark as it\r\nis, I think I could see a lady\xe2\x80\x99s box, if there was anything of the sort\r\nin our immediate neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy box is at the cloak-room. What is to prevent my sending the ticket\r\nfor it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x94if you want to communicate your address by means of your\r\nbox\xe2\x80\x94nothing whatever. Think; pray think! Do you really suppose that the\r\npeople who are looking for you are such fools as not to have an eye on\r\nthe cloakroom? Do you think they are such fools\xe2\x80\x94when they find you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t come to Mr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s at eight to-night\xe2\x80\x94as not to inquire at all\r\nthe hotels? Do you think a young lady of your striking appearance (even\r\nif they consented to receive you) could take up her abode at an inn\r\nwithout becoming the subject of universal curiosity and remark? Here is\r\nnight coming on as fast as it can. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me bore you; only let me\r\nask once more\xe2\x80\x94Where are you to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to that question: in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s position, there was\r\nliterally no answer to it on her side. She was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reply is\r\nobvious\xe2\x80\x94under my roof. Mrs. Wragge will be charmed to see you. Look\r\nupon her as your aunt; pray look upon her as your aunt. The landlady is\r\na widow, the house is close by, there are no other lodgers, and there\r\nis a bedroom to let. Can anything be more satisfactory, under all the\r\ncircumstances? Pray observe, I say nothing about to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94I leave\r\nto-morrow to you, and confine myself exclusively to the night. I may,\r\nor may not, command theatrical facilities, which I am in a position to\r\noffer you. Sympathy and admiration may, or may not, be strong within\r\nme, when I contemplate the dash and independence of your character.\r\nHosts of examples of bright stars of the British drama, who have begun\r\ntheir apprenticeship to the stage as you are beginning yours, may, or\r\nmay not, crowd on my memory. These are topics for the future. For the\r\npresent, I confine myself within my strict range of duty. We are within\r\nfive minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk of my present address. Allow me to offer you my arm.\r\nNo? You hesitate? You distrust me? Good heavens! is it possible you can\r\nhave heard anything to my disadvantage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s flinching from the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire the particulars?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain, with the politest\r\ncomposure. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t spare my feelings; oblige me by speaking out. In the\r\nplainest terms, now, what have you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered him with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s desperate disregard of consequences\r\nwhen she is driven to bay\xe2\x80\x94she answered him instantly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard you are a Rogue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said the impenetrable Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cA Rogue? Well, I\r\nwaive my privilege of setting you right on that point for a fitter\r\ntime. For the sake of argument, let us say I am a Rogue. What is Mr.\r\nHuxtable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA respectable man, or I should not have seen him in the house where we\r\nfirst met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Now observe! You talked of writing to Mr. Huxtable a minute\r\nago. What do you think a respectable man is likely to do with a young\r\nlady who openly acknowledges that she has run away from her home and\r\nher friends to go on the stage? My dear girl, on your own showing, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot a respectable man you want in your present predicament. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nRogue\xe2\x80\x94like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen laughed, bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some truth in that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for recalling me to\r\nmyself and my circumstances. I have my end to gain\xe2\x80\x94and who am I, to\r\npick and choose the way of getting to it? It is my turn to beg pardon\r\nnow. I have been talking as if I was a young lady of family and\r\nposition. Absurd! We know better than that, don\xe2\x80\x99t we, Captain Wragge?\r\nYou are quite right. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s child must sleep under Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroof\xe2\x80\x94and why not yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, dexterously profiting by the sudden\r\nchange in her humor, and cunningly refraining from exasperating it by\r\nsaying more himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThis way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed him a few steps, and suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I _am_ discovered?\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cWho has any\r\nauthority over me? Who can take me back, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to go? If\r\nthey all find me to-morrow, what then? Can\xe2\x80\x99t I say No to Mr. Pendril?\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t I trust my own courage with Miss Garth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you trust your courage with your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the captain,\r\nwho had not forgotten the references to Norah which had twice escaped\r\nher already.\r\n\r\nHer head drooped. She shivered as if the cold night air had struck her,\r\nand leaned back wearily against the parapet of the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot with Norah,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI could trust myself with the\r\nothers. Not with Norah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Captain Wragge. She roused herself; looked up at\r\nthe darkening heaven, looked round at the darkening view. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must\r\nbe, must,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and followed him.\r\n\r\nThe Minster clock struck the quarter to eight as they left the Walk on\r\nthe Wall and descended the steps into Rosemary Lane. Almost at the same\r\nmoment the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk from London gave the last instructions to his\r\nsubordinates, and took up his own position, on the opposite side of the\r\nriver, within easy view of Mr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge stopped nearly midway in the one little row of houses\r\ncomposing Rosemary Lane, and let himself and his guest in at the door\r\nof his lodgings with his own key. As they entered the passage, a\r\ncare-worn woman in a widow\xe2\x80\x99s cap made her appearance with a candle. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nniece,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, presenting Magdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cmy niece on a visit to\r\nYork. She has kindly consented to occupy your empty bedroom. Consider\r\nit let, if you please, to my niece\xe2\x80\x94and be very particular in airing the\r\nsheets? Is Mrs. Wragge upstairs? Very good. You may lend me your\r\ncandle. My dear girl, Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir is on the first floor; Mrs.\r\nWragge is visible. Allow me to show you the way up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he ascended the stairs first, the care-worn widow whispered,\r\npiteously, to Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll pay me, miss. Your uncle\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain threw open the door of the front room on the first floor,\r\nand disclosed a female figure, arrayed in a gown of tarnished\r\namber-colored satin, seated solitary on a small chair, with dingy old\r\ngloves on its hands, with a tattered old book on its knees, and with\r\none little bedroom candle by its side. The figure terminated at its\r\nupper extremity in a large, smooth, white round face\xe2\x80\x94like a\r\nmoon\xe2\x80\x94encircled by a cap and green ribbons, and dimly irradiated by eyes\r\nof mild and faded blue, which looked straightforward into vacancy, and\r\ntook not the smallest notice of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, on the opening\r\nof the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wragge!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain, shouting at her as if she was fast\r\nasleep. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wragge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady of the faded blue eyes slowly rose to an apparently\r\ninterminable height. When she had at last attained an upright position,\r\nshe towered to a stature of two or three inches over six feet. Giants\r\nof both sexes are, by a wise dispensation of Providence, created, for\r\nthe most part, gentle. If Mrs. Wragge and a lamb had been placed side\r\nby side, comparison, under those circumstances, would have exposed the\r\nlamb as a rank impostor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTea, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs. Wragge, looking submissively down at her\r\nhusband, whose head, when he stood on tiptoe, barely reached her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vanstone, the younger,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, presenting Magdalen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur fair relative, whom I have met by fortunate accident. Our guest\r\nfor the night. Our guest!\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated the captain, shouting once more\r\nas if the tall lady was still fast asleep, in spite of the plain\r\ntestimony of her own eyes to the contrary.\r\n\r\nA smile expressed itself (in faint outline) on the large vacant space\r\nof Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s countenance. \xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, interrogatively. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nindeed? Please, miss, will you sit down? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x94no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry; I mean I\xe2\x80\x99m glad\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she stopped, and consulted her husband by a\r\nhelpless look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the giantess of the amber satin, more meekly\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wragge is not deaf,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s only a little\r\nslow. Constitutionally torpid\xe2\x80\x94if I may use the expression. I am merely\r\nloud with her (and I beg you will honor me by being loud, too) as a\r\nnecessary stimulant to her ideas. Shout at her\xe2\x80\x94and her mind comes up to\r\ntime. Speak to her\xe2\x80\x94and she drifts miles away from you directly. Mrs.\r\nWragge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge instantly acknowledged the stimulant. \xe2\x80\x9cTea, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ninquired, for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut your cap straight!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg ten thousand\r\npardons,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, again addressing himself to Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sad\r\ntruth is, I am a martyr to my own sense of order. All untidiness, all\r\nwant of system and regularity, cause me the acutest irritation. My\r\nattention is distracted, my composure is upset; I can\xe2\x80\x99t rest till\r\nthings are set straight again. Externally speaking, Mrs. Wragge is, to\r\nmy infinite regret, the crookedest woman I ever met with. More to the\r\nright!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the captain, as Mrs. Wragge, like a well-trained child,\r\npresented herself with her revised head-dress for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge immediately pulled the cap to the left. Magdalen rose, and\r\nset it right for her. The moon-face of the giantess brightened for the\r\nfirst time. She looked admiringly at Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s cloak and bonnet. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou like dress, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, suddenly, in a confidential whisper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow Miss Vanstone her room,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, looking as if the\r\nwhole house belonged to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe spare-room, the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspare-room, on the third floor front. Offer Miss Vanstone all articles\r\nconnected with the toilet of which she may stand in need. She has no\r\nluggage with her. Supply the deficiency, and then come back and make\r\ntea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge acknowledged the receipt of these lofty directions by a\r\nlook of placid bewilderment, and led the way out of the room; Magdalen\r\nfollowing her, with a candle presented by the attentive captain. As\r\nsoon as they were alone on the landing outside, Mrs. Wragge raised the\r\ntattered old book which she had been reading when Magdalen was first\r\npresented to her, and which she had never let out of her hand since,\r\nand slowly tapped herself on the forehead with it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my poor head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the tall lady, in meek soliloquy; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s Buzzing again worse than\r\never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuzzing?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Magdalen, in the utmost astonishment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge ascended the stairs, without offering any explanation,\r\nstopped at one of the rooms on the second floor, and led the way in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the third floor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not my room,\r\nsurely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, miss, before we go up\r\nany higher. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Buzzing in my head worse than ever. Please\r\nwait for me till I\xe2\x80\x99m a little better again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I ask for help?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I call the landlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cBless you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want help! I\xe2\x80\x99m used to\r\nit. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Buzzing in my head, off and on\xe2\x80\x94how many years?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstopped, reflected, lost herself, and suddenly tried a question in\r\ndespair. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever been at Darch\xe2\x80\x99s Dining-rooms in London?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, with an appearance of the deepest interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, wondering at the strange inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where the Buzzing in my head first began,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge,\r\nfollowing the new clue with the deepest attention and anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nemployed to wait on the gentlemen at Darch\xe2\x80\x99s Dining-rooms\xe2\x80\x94I was. The\r\ngentlemen all came together; the gentlemen were all hungry together;\r\nthe gentlemen all gave their orders together\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, and tapped\r\nher head again, despondently, with the tattered old book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you had to keep all their orders in your memory, separate one from\r\nthe other?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Magdalen, helping her out. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the trying to do\r\nthat confused you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, becoming violently excited in a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoiled pork and greens and pease-pudding, for Number One. Stewed beef\r\nand carrots and gooseberry tart, for Number Two. Cut of mutton, and\r\nquick about it, well done, and plenty of fat, for Number Three. Codfish\r\nand parsnips, two chops to follow, hot-and-hot, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the death of\r\nyou, for Number Four. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Carrots and\r\ngooseberry tart\xe2\x80\x94pease-pudding and plenty of fat\xe2\x80\x94pork and beef and\r\nmutton, and cut \xe2\x80\x99em all, and quick about it\xe2\x80\x94stout for one, and ale for\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other\xe2\x80\x94and stale bread here, and new bread there\xe2\x80\x94and this gentleman\r\nlikes cheese, and that gentleman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94Matilda, Tilda, Tilda, Tilda,\r\nfifty times over, till I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know my own name again\xe2\x80\x94oh lord! oh\r\nlord!! oh lord!!! all together, all at the same time, all out of\r\ntemper, all buzzing in my poor head like forty thousand million\r\nbees\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t tell the captain! don\xe2\x80\x99t tell the captain!\xe2\x80\x9d The unfortunate\r\ncreature dropped the tattered old book, and beat both her hands on her\r\nhead, with a look of blank terror fixed on the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cThe captain hasn\xe2\x80\x99t heard you. I know what\r\nis the matter with your head now. Let me cool it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dipped a towel in water, and pressed it on the hot and helpless\r\nhead which Mrs. Wragge submitted to her with the docility of a sick\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pretty hand you\xe2\x80\x99ve got!\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor creature, feeling the\r\nrelief of the coolness and taking Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s hand, admiringly, in her\r\nown. \xe2\x80\x9cHow soft and white it is! I try to be a lady; I always keep my\r\ngloves on\xe2\x80\x94but I can\xe2\x80\x99t get my hands like yours. I\xe2\x80\x99m nicely dressed,\r\nthough, ain\xe2\x80\x99t I? I like dress; it\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m always happy\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at my things. I say\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me?\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshould so like to try your bonnet on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen humored her, with the ready compassion of the young. She stood\r\nsmiling and nodding at herself in the glass, with the bonnet perched on\r\nthe top of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI had one as pretty as this, once,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly it was white, not black. I wore it when the captain married\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you meet with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, putting the question as\r\na chance means of increasing her scanty stock of information on the\r\nsubject of Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Dining-rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was the hungriest and the\r\nloudest to wait upon of the lot of \xe2\x80\x99em. I made more mistakes with him\r\nthan I did with all the rest of them put together. He used to swear\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t he use to swear! When he left off swearing at me he married me.\r\nThere was others wanted me besides him. Bless you, I had my pick. Why\r\nnot? When you have a trifle of money left you that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect,\r\nif that don\xe2\x80\x99t make a lady of you, what does? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lady to have her\r\npick? I had my trifle of money, and I had my pick, and I picked the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x94I did. He was the smartest and the shortest of them all. He\r\ntook care of me and my money. I\xe2\x80\x99m here, the money\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you put\r\nthat towel down on the table\xe2\x80\x94he won\xe2\x80\x99t have that! Don\xe2\x80\x99t move his\r\nrazors\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t, please, or I shall forget which is which. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nremember which is which to-morrow morning. Bless you, the captain don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshave himself! He had me taught. I shave him. I do his hair, and cut\r\nhis nails\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s awfully particular about his nails. So he is about his\r\ntrousers. And his shoes. And his newspaper in the morning. And his\r\nbreakfasts, and lunches, and dinners, and teas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, struck by\r\na sudden recollection, looked about her, observed the tattered old book\r\non the floor, and clasped her hands in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe exclaimed helplessly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, mercy, what will become of me! I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost\r\nthe place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll soon find the place for you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe picked up the book, looked into the pages, and found that the\r\nobject of Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety was nothing more important than an\r\nold-fashioned Treatise on the Art of Cookery, reduced under the usual\r\nheads of Fish, Flesh, and Fowl, and containing the customary series of\r\nrecipes. Turning over the leaves, Magdalen came to one particular page,\r\nthickly studded with little drops of moisture half dry. \xe2\x80\x9cCurious!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this was anything but a cookery-book, I should say somebody\r\nhad been crying over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mrs. Wragge, with a stare of amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s Me. Thank you kindly, that\xe2\x80\x99s the place, sure enough.\r\nBless you, I\xe2\x80\x99m used to crying over it. You\xe2\x80\x99d cry, too, if you had to\r\nget the captain\xe2\x80\x99s dinners out of it. As sure as ever I sit down to this\r\nbook the Buzzing in my head begins again. Who\xe2\x80\x99s to make it out?\r\nSometimes I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, and it all goes away from me. Sometimes\r\nI think I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it, and it all comes back in a heap. Look here!\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s ordered for his breakfast to-morrow: \xe2\x80\x98Omelette with\r\nHerbs. Beat up two eggs with a little water or milk, salt, pepper,\r\nchives, and parsley. Mince small.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94There! mince small! How am I to\r\nmince small when it\xe2\x80\x99s all mixed up and running? \xe2\x80\x98Put a piece of butter\r\nthe size of your thumb into the frying-pan.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Look at my thumb, and look\r\nat yours! whose size does she mean? \xe2\x80\x98Boil, but not brown.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94If it\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t be brown, what color must it be? She won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me; she expects\r\nme to know, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x98Pour in the omelette.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94There! I can do that.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Allow it to set, raise it round the edge; when done, turn it over to\r\ndouble it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Oh, the number of times I turned it over and doubled it in\r\nmy head, before you came in to-night! \xe2\x80\x98Keep it soft; put the dish on\r\nthe frying-pan, and turn it over.\xe2\x80\x99 Which am I to turn over\xe2\x80\x94oh, mercy,\r\ntry the cold towel again, and tell me which\xe2\x80\x94the dish or the\r\nfrying-pan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the dish on the frying-pan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cand then turn the\r\nfrying-pan over. That is what it means, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you kindly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get it into my head;\r\nplease say it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen said it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then turn the frying-pan over,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Wragge, with a\r\nsudden burst of energy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now! Oh, the lots of omelettes all\r\nfrying together in my head; and all frying wrong! Much obliged, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure. You\xe2\x80\x99ve put me all right again: I\xe2\x80\x99m only a little tired with\r\ntalking. And then turn the frying-pan, then turn the frying-pan, then\r\nturn the frying-pan over. It sounds like poetry, don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice sank, and she drowsily closed her eyes. At the same moment\r\nthe door of the room below opened, and the captain\xe2\x80\x99s mellifluous bass\r\nnotes floated upstairs, charged with the customary stimulant to his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s faculties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wragge!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wragge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet at that terrible summons. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what did he tell\r\nme to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, distractedly. \xe2\x80\x9cLots of things, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten\r\nthem all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay you have done them when he asks you,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nwere things for me\xe2\x80\x94things I don\xe2\x80\x99t want. I remember all that is\r\nnecessary. My room is the front room on the third floor. Go downstairs\r\nand say I am coming directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up the candle and pushed Mrs. Wragge out on the landing. \xe2\x80\x9cSay\r\nI am coming directly,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered again\xe2\x80\x94and went upstairs by herself\r\nto the third story.\r\n\r\nThe room was small, close, and very poorly furnished. In former days\r\nMiss Garth would have hesitated to offer such a room to one of the\r\nservants at Combe-Raven. But it was quiet; it gave her a few minutes\r\nalone; and it was endurable, even welcome, on that account. She locked\r\nherself in and walked mechanically, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse in a\r\nstrange bedroom, to the rickety little table and the dingy little\r\nlooking-glass. She waited there for a moment, and then turned away with\r\nweary contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter how pale I am?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cFrank can\xe2\x80\x99t see me\xe2\x80\x94what does it matter now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid aside her cloak and bonnet, and sat down to collect herself.\r\nBut the events of the day had worn her out. The past, when she tried to\r\nremember it, only made her heart ache. The future, when she tried to\r\npenetrate it, was a black void. She rose again, and stood by the\r\nuncurtained window\xe2\x80\x94stood looking out, as if there was some hidden\r\nsympathy for her own desolation in the desolate night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, tenderly; \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Norah is thinking\r\nof me? Oh, if I could be as patient as she is! If I could only forget\r\nthe debt we owe to Michael Vanstone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face darkened with a vindictive despair, and she paced the little\r\ncage of a room backward and forward, softly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo: never till the debt\r\nis paid!\xe2\x80\x9d Her thoughts veered back again to Frank. \xe2\x80\x9cStill at sea, poor\r\nfellow; further and further away from me; sailing through the day,\r\nsailing through the night. Oh, Frank, love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes filled with tears. She dashed them away, made for the door,\r\nand laughed with a desperate levity, as she unlocked it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny company is better than my own thoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out,\r\nrecklessly, as she left the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m forgetting my ready-made\r\nrelations\xe2\x80\x94my half-witted aunt, and my uncle the rogue.\xe2\x80\x9d She descended\r\nthe stairs to the landing on the first floor, and paused there in\r\nmomentary hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cHow will it end?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is\r\nmy blindfolded journey taking me to now? Who knows, and who cares?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe entered the room.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge was presiding at the tea-tray with the air of a prince\r\nin his own banqueting-hall. At one side of the table sat Mrs. Wragge,\r\nwatching her husband\xe2\x80\x99s eye like an animal waiting to be fed. At the\r\nother side was an empty chair, toward which the captain waved his\r\npersuasive hand when Magdalen came in. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you like your room?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ninquired; \xe2\x80\x9cI trust Mrs. Wragge has made herself useful? You take milk\r\nand sugar? Try the local bread, honor the York butter, test the\r\nfreshness of a new and neighboring egg. I offer my little all. A\r\npauper\xe2\x80\x99s meal, my dear girl\xe2\x80\x94seasoned with a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeasoned with salt, pepper, chives and parsley,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Wragge,\r\ncatching instantly at a word in connection with cookery, and harnessing\r\nher head to the omelette for the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit straight at the table!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cMore to the left,\r\nmore still\xe2\x80\x94that will do. During your absence upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\naddressing himself to Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mind has not been unemployed. I\r\nhave been considering your position with a view exclusively to your own\r\nbenefit. If you decide on being guided to-morrow by the light of my\r\nexperience, that light is unreservedly at your service. You may\r\nnaturally say: \xe2\x80\x98I know but little of you, captain, and that little is\r\nunfavorable.\xe2\x80\x99 Granted, on one condition\xe2\x80\x94that you permit me to make\r\nmyself and my character quite familiar to you when tea is over. False\r\nshame is foreign to my nature. You see my wife, my house, my bread, my\r\nbutter, and my eggs, all exactly as they are. See me, too, my dear\r\ngirl, while you are about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen tea was over, Mrs. Wragge, at a signal from her husband, retired\r\nto a corner of the room, with the eternal cookery-book still in her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cMince small,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, confidentially, as she passed\r\nMagdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a teaser, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown at heel again!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the captain, pointing to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s heavy\r\nflat feet as they shuffled across the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThe right shoe. Pull it up\r\nat heel, Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x94pull it up at heel! Pray allow me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\noffering his arm to Magdalen, and escorting her to a dirty little\r\nhorse-hair sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want repose\xe2\x80\x94after your long journey, you really\r\nwant repose.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew his chair to the sofa, and surveyed her with a\r\nbland look of investigation\xe2\x80\x94as if he had been her medical attendant,\r\nwith a diagnosis on his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery pleasant! very pleasant!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, when he had seen his\r\nguest comfortable on the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel quite in the bosom of my family.\r\nShall we return to our subject\xe2\x80\x94the subject of my rascally self? No! no!\r\nNo apologies, no protestations, pray. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mince the matter on your\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94and depend on me not to mince it on mine. Now come to facts; pray\r\ncome to facts. Who, and what am I? Carry your mind back to our\r\nconversation on the Walls of this interesting City, and let us start\r\nonce more from your point of view. I am a Rogue; and, in that capacity\r\n(as I have already pointed out), the most useful man you possibly could\r\nhave met with. Now observe! There are many varieties of Rogue; let me\r\ntell you my variety, to begin with. I am a Swindler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis entire shamelessness was really super-human. Not the vestige of a\r\nblush varied the sallow monotony of his complexion; the smile wreathed\r\nhis curly lips as pleasantly as ever his party-colored eyes twinkled at\r\nMagdalen with the self-enjoying frankness of a naturally harmless man.\r\nHad his wife heard him? Magdalen looked over his shoulder to the corner\r\nof the room in which she was sitting behind him. No: the self-taught\r\nstudent of cookery was absorbed in her subject. She had advanced her\r\nimaginary omelette to the critical stage at which the butter was to be\r\nthrown in\xe2\x80\x94that vaguely-measured morsel of butter, the size of your\r\nthumb. Mrs. Wragge sat lost in contemplation of one of her own thumbs,\r\nand shook her head over it, as if it failed to satisfy her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be shocked,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the captain; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be astonished.\r\nSwindler is nothing but a word of two syllables. S, W, I, N, D\xe2\x80\x94swind;\r\nL, E, R\xe2\x80\x94ler; Swindler. Definition: A moral agriculturist; a man who\r\ncultivates the field of human sympathy. I am that moral agriculturist,\r\nthat cultivating man. Narrow-minded mediocrity, envious of my success\r\nin my profession, calls me a Swindler. What of that? The same low tone\r\nof mind assails men in other professions in a similar manner\xe2\x80\x94calls\r\ngreat writers scribblers\xe2\x80\x94great generals, butchers\xe2\x80\x94and so on. It\r\nentirely depends on the point of view. Adopting your point, I announce\r\nmyself intelligibly as a Swindler. Now return the obligation, and adopt\r\nmine. Hear what I have to say for myself, in the exercise of my\r\nprofession.\xe2\x80\x94Shall I continue to put it frankly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you frankly afterward what I think\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain cleared his throat; mentally assembled his entire army of\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94horse, foot, artillery, and reserves; put himself at the head;\r\nand dashed into action, to carry the moral intrenchments of Society by\r\na general charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow observe,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cHere am I, a needy object. Very good. Without\r\ncomplicating the question by asking how I come to be in that condition,\r\nI will merely inquire whether it is, or is not, the duty of a Christian\r\ncommunity to help the needy. If you say No, you simply shock me; and\r\nthere is an end of it; if you say Yes, then I beg to ask, Why am I to\r\nblame for making a Christian community do its duty? You may say, Is a\r\ncareful man who has saved money bound to spend it again on a careless\r\nstranger who has saved none? Why of course he is! And on what ground,\r\npray? Good heavens! on the ground that he has _got_ the money, to be\r\nsure. All the world over, the man who has not got the thing, obtains\r\nit, on one pretense or another, of the man who has\xe2\x80\x94and, in nine cases\r\nout of ten, the pretense is a false one. What! your pockets are full,\r\nand my pockets are empty; and you refuse to help me? Sordid wretch! do\r\nyou think I will allow you to violate the sacred obligations of charity\r\nin my person? I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow you\xe2\x80\x94I say, distinctly, I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow you.\r\nThose are my principles as a moral agriculturist. Principles which\r\nadmit of trickery? Certainly. Am I to blame if the field of human\r\nsympathy can\xe2\x80\x99t be cultivated in any other way? Consult my brother\r\nagriculturists in the mere farming line\xe2\x80\x94do they get their crops for the\r\nasking? No! they must circumvent arid Nature exactly as I circumvent\r\nsordid Man. They must plow, and sow, and top-dress, and bottom-dress,\r\nand deep-drain, and surface-drain, and all the rest of it. Why am I to\r\nbe checked in the vast occupation of deep-draining mankind? Why am I to\r\nbe persecuted for habitually exciting the noblest feelings of our\r\ncommon nature? Infamous!\xe2\x80\x94I can characterize it by no other\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94infamous! If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t confidence in the future, I should despair\r\nof humanity\xe2\x80\x94but I have confidence in the future. Yes! one of these days\r\n(when I am dead and gone), as ideas enlarge and enlightenment\r\nprogresses, the abstract merits of the profession now called swindling\r\nwill be recognized. When that day comes, don\xe2\x80\x99t drag me out of my grave\r\nand give me a public funeral; don\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of my having no\r\nvoice to raise in my own defense, and insult me by a national statue.\r\nNo! do me justice on my tombstone; dash me off, in one masterly\r\nsentence, on my epitaph. Here lies Wragge, embalmed in the tardy\r\nrecognition of his species: he plowed, sowed, and reaped his\r\nfellow-creatures; and enlightened posterity congratulates him on the\r\nuniform excellence of his crops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped; not from want of confidence, not from want of words\xe2\x80\x94purely\r\nfrom want of breath. \xe2\x80\x9cI put it frankly, with a dash of humor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\npleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t shock you\xe2\x80\x94do I?\xe2\x80\x9d Weary and heart-sick as she\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94suspicious of others, doubtful of herself\xe2\x80\x94the extravagant impudence\r\nof Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s defense of swindling touched Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s natural\r\nsense of humor, and forced a smile to her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the Yorkshire crop\r\na particularly rich one just at present?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, meeting him, in\r\nher neatly feminine way, with his own weapons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hit\xe2\x80\x94a palpable hit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, jocosely exhibiting the tails\r\nof his threadbare shooting jacket, as a practical commentary on\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s remark. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl, here or elsewhere, the crop never\r\nfails\xe2\x80\x94but one man can\xe2\x80\x99t always gather it in. The assistance of\r\nintelligent co-operation is, I regret to say, denied me. I have nothing\r\nin common with the clumsy rank and file of my profession, who convict\r\nthemselves, before recorders and magistrates, of the worst of all\r\noffenses\xe2\x80\x94incurable stupidity in the exercise of their own vocation.\r\nSuch as you see me, I stand entirely alone. After years of successful\r\nself-dependence, the penalties of celebrity are beginning to attach to\r\nme. On my way from the North, I pause at this interesting city for the\r\nthird time; I consult my Books for the customary references to past\r\nlocal experience; I find under the heading, \xe2\x80\x98Personal position in\r\nYork,\xe2\x80\x99 the initials, T. W. K., signifying Too Well Known. I refer to my\r\nIndex, and turn to the surrounding neighborhood. The same brief marks\r\nmeet my eye. \xe2\x80\x98Leeds. T. W. K.\xe2\x80\x94Scarborough. T. W. K.\xe2\x80\x94Harrowgate. T. W.\r\nK.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and so on. What is the inevitable consequence? I suspend my\r\nproceedings; my resources evaporate; and my fair relative finds me the\r\npauper gentleman whom she now sees before her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour books?\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat books do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust me, or not, as you like\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ntrust _you_ implicitly. You shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he retired into the back room. While he was gone,\r\nMagdalen stole another look at Mrs. Wragge. Was she still self-isolated\r\nfrom her husband\xe2\x80\x99s deluge of words? Perfectly self-isolated. She had\r\nadvanced the imaginary omelette to the last stage of culinary progress;\r\nand she was now rehearsing the final operation of turning it over\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nthe palm of her hand to represent the dish, and the cookery-book to\r\nimpersonate the frying-pan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, nodding\r\nacross the room at Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst put the frying-pan on the dish, and\r\nthen tumble both of them over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge returned, carrying a neat black dispatch-box, adorned\r\nwith a bright brass lock. He produced from the box five or six plump\r\nlittle books, bound in commercial calf and vellum, and each fitted\r\ncomfortably with its own little lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind!\xe2\x80\x9d said the moral agriculturist, \xe2\x80\x9cI take no credit to myself for\r\nthis: it is my nature to be orderly, and orderly I am. I must have\r\neverything down in black and white, or I should go mad! Here is my\r\ncommercial library: Daybook, Ledger, Book of Districts, Book of\r\nLetters, Book of Remarks, and so on. Kindly throw your eye over any one\r\nof them. I flatter myself there is no such thing as a blot, or a\r\ncareless entry in it, from the first page to the last. Look at this\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94is there a chair out of place? Not if I know it! Look at _me_. Am\r\nI dusty? am I dirty? am I half shaved? Am I, in brief, a speckless\r\npauper, or am I not? Mind! I take no credit to myself; the nature of\r\nthe man, my dear girl\xe2\x80\x94the nature of the man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened one of the books. Magdalen was no judge of the admirable\r\ncorrectness with which the accounts inside were all kept; but she could\r\nestimate the neatness of the handwriting, the regularity in the rows of\r\nfigures, the mathematical exactness of the ruled lines in red and black\r\nink, the cleanly absence of blots, stains, or erasures. Although\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s inborn sense of order was in him\xe2\x80\x94as it is in others\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsense too inveterately mechanical to exercise any elevating moral\r\ninfluence over his actions, it had produced its legitimate effect on\r\nhis habits, and had reduced his rogueries as strictly to method and\r\nsystem as if they had been the commercial transactions of an honest\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn appearance, my system looks complicated?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nreality, it is simplicity itself. I merely avoid the errors of inferior\r\npractitioners. That is to say, I never plead for myself; and I never\r\napply to rich people\xe2\x80\x94both fatal mistakes which the inferior\r\npractitioner perpetually commits. People with small means sometimes\r\nhave generous impulses in connection with money\xe2\x80\x94rich people, _never_.\r\nMy lord, with forty thousand a year; Sir John, with property in half a\r\ndozen counties\xe2\x80\x94those are the men who never forgive the genteel beggar\r\nfor swindling them out of a sovereign; those are the men who send for\r\nthe mendicity officers; those are the men who take care of their money.\r\nWho are the people who lose shillings and sixpences by sheer\r\nthoughtlessness? Servants and small clerks, to whom shillings and\r\nsixpences are of consequence. Did you ever hear of Rothschild or Baring\r\ndropping a fourpenny-piece down a gutter-hole? Fourpence in\r\nRothschild\xe2\x80\x99s pocket is safer than fourpence in the pocket of that woman\r\nwho is crying stale shrimps in Skeldergate at this moment. Fortified by\r\nthese sound principles, enlightened by the stores of written\r\ninformation in my commercial library, I have ranged through the\r\npopulation for years past, and have raised my charitable crops with the\r\nmost cheering success. Here, in book Number One, are all my Districts\r\nmapped out, with the prevalent public feeling to appeal to in each:\r\nMilitary District, Clerical District, Agricultural District; et cetera,\r\net cetera. Here, in Number Two, are my cases that I plead: Family of an\r\nofficer who fell at Waterloo; Wife of a poor curate stricken down by\r\nnervous debility; Widow of a grazier in difficulties gored to death by\r\na mad bull; et cetera, et cetera. Here, in Number Three, are the people\r\nwho have heard of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s family, the curate\xe2\x80\x99s wife, the\r\ngrazier\xe2\x80\x99s widow, and the people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t; the people who have said\r\nYes, and the people who have said No; the people to try again, the\r\npeople who want a fresh case to stir them up, the people who are\r\ndoubtful, the people to beware of; et cetera, et cetera. Here, in\r\nNumber Four, are my Adopted Handwritings of public characters; my\r\ntestimonials to my own worth and integrity; my Heartrending Statements\r\nof the officer\xe2\x80\x99s family, the curate\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and the grazier\xe2\x80\x99s widow,\r\nstained with tears, blotted with emotion; et cetera, et cetera. Here,\r\nin Numbers Five and Six, are my own personal subscriptions to local\r\ncharities, actually paid in remunerative neighborhoods, on the\r\nprinciple of throwing a sprat to catch a herring; also, my diary of\r\neach day\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings, my personal reflections and remarks, my\r\nstatement of existing difficulties (such as the difficulty of finding\r\nmyself T. W. K. in this interesting city); my outgivings and incomings;\r\nwind and weather; politics and public events; fluctuations in my own\r\nhealth; fluctuations in Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s head; fluctuations in our means\r\nand meals, our payments, prospects, and principles; et cetera, et\r\ncetera. So, my dear girl, the Swindler\xe2\x80\x99s Mill goes. So you see me\r\nexactly as I am. You knew, before I met you, that I lived on my wits.\r\nWell! have I, or have I not, shown you that I have wits to live on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you have done yourself full justice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all exhausted,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI can go on, if\r\nnecessary, for the rest of the evening.\xe2\x80\x94However, if I have done myself\r\nfull justice, perhaps I may leave the remaining points in my character\r\nto develop themselves at future opportunities. For the present, I\r\nwithdraw myself from notice. Exit Wragge. And now to business! Permit\r\nme to inquire what effect I have produced on your own mind? Do you\r\nstill believe that the Rogue who has trusted you with all his secrets\r\nis a Rogue who is bent on taking a mean advantage of a fair relative?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait a little,\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalen rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I answer that\r\nquestion. When I came down to tea, you told me you had been employing\r\nyour mind for my benefit. May I ask how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have the net result of\r\nthe whole mental process. Said process ranges over the present and\r\nfuture proceedings of your disconsolate friends, and of the lawyers who\r\nare helping them to find you. Their present proceedings are, in all\r\nprobability, assuming the following form: the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk has given\r\nyou up at Mr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s, and has also, by this time, given you up,\r\nafter careful inquiry, at all the hotels. His last chance is that you\r\nmay send for your box to the cloak-room\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t send for it\xe2\x80\x94and there\r\nthe clerk is to-night (thanks to Captain Wragge and Rosemary Lane) at\r\nthe end of his resources. He will forthwith communicate that fact to\r\nhis employers in London; and those employers (don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed!) will\r\napply for help to the detective police. Allowing for inevitable delays,\r\na professional spy, with all his wits about him, and with those\r\nhandbills to help him privately in identifying you, will be here\r\ncertainly not later than the day after tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94possibly earlier. If\r\nyou remain in York, if you attempt to communicate with Mr. Huxtable,\r\nthat spy will find you out. If, on the other hand, you leave the city\r\nbefore he comes (taking your departure by other means than the railway,\r\nof course) you put him in the same predicament as the clerk\xe2\x80\x94you defy\r\nhim to find a fresh trace of you. There is my brief abstract of your\r\npresent position. What do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it has one defect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ends in nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ends in an arrangement for your\r\nsafe departure, and in a plan for the entire gratification of your\r\nwishes in the direction of the stage. Both drawn from the resources of\r\nmy own experience, and both waiting a word from you, to be poured forth\r\nimmediately in the fullest detail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know what that word is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, looking at him\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharmed to hear it, I am sure. You have only to say, \xe2\x80\x98Captain Wragge,\r\ntake charge of me\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and my plans are yours from that moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take to-night to consider your proposal,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x99s reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have my answer to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge looked a little disappointed. He had not expected the\r\nreservation on his side to be met so composedly by a reservation on\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not decide at once?\xe2\x80\x9d he remonstrated, in his most persuasive\r\ntones. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have only to consider\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have more to consider than you think for,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nanother object in view besides the object you know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x94you may _not_ ask. Allow me to thank you for\r\nyour hospitality, and to wish you good-night. I am worn out. I want\r\nrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more the captain wisely adapted himself to her humor with the\r\nready self-control of an experienced man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorn out, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cUnpardonable on my\r\npart not to have thought of it before. We will resume our conversation\r\nto-morrow. Permit me to give you a candle. Mrs. Wragge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProstrated by mental exertion, Mrs. Wragge was pursuing the course of\r\nthe omelette in dreams. Her head was twisted one way, and her body the\r\nother. She snored meekly. At intervals one of her hands raised itself\r\nin the air, shook an imaginary frying-pan, and dropped again with a\r\nfaint thump on the cookery-book in her lap. At the sound of her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s voice, she started to her feet, and confronted him with her\r\nmind fast asleep, and her eyes wide open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssist Miss Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next time you forget\r\nyourself in your chair, fall asleep straight\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t annoy me by falling\r\nasleep crooked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge opened her eyes a little wider, and looked at Magdalen in\r\nhelpless amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the captain breakfasting by candle-light?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, meekly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd haven\xe2\x80\x99t I done the omelette?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore her husband\xe2\x80\x99s corrective voice could apply a fresh stimulant,\r\nMagdalen took her compassionately by the arm and led her out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother object besides the object I know of?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Captain Wragge,\r\nwhen he was left by himself. \xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ there a gentleman in the background,\r\nafter all? Is there mischief brewing in the dark that I don\xe2\x80\x99t bargain\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nToward six o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning, the light pouring in on her face\r\nawoke Magdalen in the bedroom in Rosemary Lane.\r\n\r\nShe started from her deep, dreamless repose of the past night with that\r\npainful sense of bewilderment, on first waking, which is familiar to\r\nall sleepers in strange beds. \xe2\x80\x9cNorah!\xe2\x80\x9d she called out mechanically,\r\nwhen she opened her eyes. The next instant her mind roused itself, and\r\nher senses told her the truth. She looked round the miserable room with\r\na loathing recognition of it. The sordid contrast which the place\r\npresented to all that she had been accustomed to see in her own\r\nbed-chamber\xe2\x80\x94the practical abandonment, implied in its scanty furniture,\r\nof those elegant purities of personal habit to which she had been\r\naccustomed from her childhood\xe2\x80\x94shocked that sense of bodily self-respect\r\nin Magdalen which is a refined woman\xe2\x80\x99s second nature. Contemptible as\r\nthe influence seemed, when compared with her situation at that moment,\r\nthe bare sight of the jug and basin in a corner of the room decided her\r\nfirst resolution when she woke. She determined, then and there, to\r\nleave Rosemary Lane.\r\n\r\nHow was she to leave it? With Captain Wragge, or without him?\r\n\r\nShe dressed herself, with a dainty shrinking from everything in the\r\nroom which her hands or her clothes touched in the process, and then\r\nopened the window. The autumn air felt keen and sweet; and the little\r\npatch of sky that she could see was warmly bright already with the new\r\nsunlight. Distant voices of bargemen on the river, and the chirping of\r\nbirds among the weeds which topped the old city wall, were the only\r\nsounds that broke the morning silence. She sat down by the window; and\r\nsearched her mind for the thoughts which she had lost, when weariness\r\novercame her on the night before.\r\n\r\nThe first subject to which she returned was the vagabond subject of\r\nCaptain Wragge.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cmoral agriculturist\xe2\x80\x9d had failed to remove her personal distrust of\r\nhim, cunningly as he had tried to plead against it by openly confessing\r\nthe impostures that he had practiced on others. He had raised her\r\nopinion of his abilities; he had amused her by his humor; he had\r\nastonished her by his assurance; but he had left her original\r\nconviction that he was a Rogue exactly where it was when he first met\r\nwith her. If the one design then in her mind had been the design of\r\ngoing on the stage, she would, at all hazards, have rejected the more\r\nthan doubtful assistance of Captain Wragge on the spot.\r\n\r\nBut the perilous journey on which she had now adventured herself had\r\nanother end in view\xe2\x80\x94an end, dark and distant\xe2\x80\x94an end, with pitfalls\r\nhidden on the way to it, far other than the shallow pitfalls on the way\r\nto the stage. In the mysterious stillness of the morning, her mind\r\nlooked on to its second and its deeper design, and the despicable\r\nfigure of the swindler rose before her in a new view.\r\n\r\nShe tried to shut him out\xe2\x80\x94to feel above him and beyond him again, as\r\nshe had felt up to this time.\r\n\r\nAfter a little trifling with her dress, she took from her bosom the\r\nwhite silk bag which her own hands had made on the farewell night at\r\nCombe-Raven. It drew together at the mouth with delicate silken\r\nstrings. The first thing she took out, on opening it, was a lock of\r\nFrank\xe2\x80\x99s hair, tied with a morsel of silver thread; the next was a sheet\r\nof paper containing the extracts which she had copied from her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill and her father\xe2\x80\x99s letter; the last was a closely-folded packet of\r\nbank-notes, to the value of nearly two hundred pounds\xe2\x80\x94the produce (as\r\nMiss Garth had rightly conjectured) of the sale of her jewelry and her\r\ndresses, in which the servant at the boarding-school had privately\r\nassisted her. She put back the notes at once, without a second glance\r\nat them, and then sat looking thoughtfully at the lock of hair as it\r\nlay on her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are better than nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking to it\r\nwith a girl\xe2\x80\x99s fanciful tenderness. \xe2\x80\x9cI can sit and look at you\r\nsometimes, till I almost think I am looking at Frank. Oh, my darling!\r\nmy darling!\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice faltered softly, and she put the lock of hair,\r\nwith a languid gentleness, to her lips. It fell from her fingers into\r\nher bosom. A lovely tinge of color rose on her cheeks, and spread\r\ndownward to her neck, as if it followed the falling hair. She closed\r\nher eyes, and let her fair head droop softly. The world passed from\r\nher; and, for one enchanted moment, Love opened the gates of Paradise\r\nto the daughter of Eve.\r\n\r\nThe trivial noises in the neighboring street, gathering in number as\r\nthe morning advanced, forced her back to the hard realities of the\r\npassing time. She raised her head with a heavy sigh, and opened her\r\neyes once more on the mean and miserable little room.\r\n\r\nThe extracts from the will and the letter\xe2\x80\x94those last memorials of her\r\nfather, now so closely associated with the purpose which had possession\r\nof her mind\xe2\x80\x94still lay before her. The transient color faded from her\r\nface, as she spread the little manuscript open on her lap. The extracts\r\nfrom the will stood highest on the page; they were limited to those few\r\ntouching words in which the dead father begged his children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforgiveness for the stain on their birth, and implored them to remember\r\nthe untiring love and care by which he had striven to atone for it. The\r\nextract from the letter to Mr. Pendril came next. She read the last\r\nmelancholy sentences aloud to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake come on the day\r\nwhen you receive this\xe2\x80\x94come and relieve me from the dreadful thought\r\nthat my two darling girls are at this moment unprovided for. If\r\nanything happened to me, and if my desire to do their mother justice\r\nended (through my miserable ignorance of the law) in leaving Norah and\r\nMagdalen disinherited, I should not rest in my grave!\xe2\x80\x9d Under these\r\nlines again, and close at the bottom of the page, was written the\r\nterrible commentary on that letter which had fallen from Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters are Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s Children, and the law\r\nleaves them helpless at their uncle\xe2\x80\x99s mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelpless when those words were spoken\xe2\x80\x94helpless still, after all that\r\nshe had resolved, after all that she had sacrificed. The assertion of\r\nher natural rights and her sister\xe2\x80\x99s, sanctioned by the direct\r\nexpression of her father\xe2\x80\x99s last wishes; the recall of Frank from China;\r\nthe justification of her desertion of Norah\xe2\x80\x94all hung on her desperate\r\npurpose of recovering the lost inheritance, at any risk, from the man\r\nwho had beggared and insulted his brother\xe2\x80\x99s children. And that man was\r\nstill a shadow to her! So little did she know of him that she was even\r\nignorant at that moment of his place of abode.\r\n\r\nShe rose and paced the room with the noiseless, negligent grace of a\r\nwild creature of the forest in its cage. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I reach him in the\r\ndark?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I find out\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped\r\nsuddenly. Before the question had shaped itself to an end in her\r\nthoughts, Captain Wragge was back in her mind again.\r\n\r\nA man well used to working in the dark; a man with endless resources of\r\naudacity and cunning; a man who would hesitate at no mean employment\r\nthat could be offered to him, if it was employment that filled his\r\npockets\xe2\x80\x94was this the instrument for which, in its present need, her\r\nhand was waiting? Two of the necessities to be met, before she could\r\ntake a single step in advance, were plainly present to her\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnecessity of knowing more of her father\xe2\x80\x99s brother than she knew now;\r\nand the necessity of throwing him off his guard by concealing herself\r\npersonally during the process of inquiry. Resolutely self-dependent as\r\nshe was, the inevitable spy\xe2\x80\x99s work at the outset must be work delegated\r\nto another. In her position, was there any ready human creature within\r\nreach but the vagabond downstairs? Not one. She thought of it\r\nanxiously, she thought of it long. Not one! There the choice was,\r\nsteadily confronting her: the choice of taking the Rogue, or of turning\r\nher back on the Purpose.\r\n\r\nShe paused in the middle of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he do at his worst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cCheat me. Well! if my money governs him for me,\r\nwhat then? Let him have my money!\xe2\x80\x9d She returned mechanically to her\r\nplace by the window. A moment more decided her. A moment more, and she\r\ntook the first fatal step downward-she determined to face the risk, and\r\ntry Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the landlady knocked at Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s door, and informed\r\nher (with the captain\xe2\x80\x99s kind compliments) that breakfast was ready.\r\n\r\nShe found Mrs. Wragge alone, attired in a voluminous brown holland\r\nwrapper, with a limp cape and a trimming of dingy pink ribbon. The\r\nex-waitress at Darch\xe2\x80\x99s Dining-rooms was absorbed in the contemplation\r\nof a large dish, containing a leathery-looking substance of a mottled\r\nyellow color, profusely sprinkled with little black spots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cOmelette with herbs. The landlady\r\nhelped me. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve made of it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask the captain\r\nfor any when he comes in\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good soul. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t nice. We\r\nhad some accidents with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s been under the grate. It\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nspilled on the stairs. It\xe2\x80\x99s scalded the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s youngest boy\xe2\x80\x94he went\r\nand sat on it. Bless you, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t half as nice as it looks! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nask for any. Perhaps he won\xe2\x80\x99t notice if you say nothing about it. What\r\ndo you think of my wrapper? I should so like to have a white one. Have\r\nyou got a white one? How is it trimmed? Do tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe formidable entrance of the captain suspended the next question on\r\nher lips. Fortunately for Mrs. Wragge, her husband was far too anxious\r\nfor the promised expression of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pay his customary\r\nattention to questions of cookery. When breakfast was over, he\r\ndismissed Mrs. Wragge, and merely referred to the omelette by telling\r\nher that she had his full permission to \xe2\x80\x9cgive it to the dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does my little proposal look by daylight?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, placing\r\nchairs for Magdalen and himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is it to be: \xe2\x80\x98Captain Wragge,\r\ntake charge of me?\xe2\x80\x99 or, \xe2\x80\x98Captain Wragge, good-morning?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear directly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI have something to say\r\nfirst. I told you, last night, that I had another object in view\r\nbesides the object of earning my living on the stage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you say, earning\r\nyour living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Both my sister and myself must depend on our own exertions\r\nto gain our daily bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!!!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain, starting to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cThe daughters of my\r\nwealthy and lamented relative by marriage reduced to earn their own\r\nliving? Impossible\xe2\x80\x94wildly, extravagantly impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d He sat down\r\nagain, and looked at Magdalen as if she had inflicted a personal injury\r\non him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not acquainted with the full extent of our misfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what has happened before I go any\r\nfurther.\xe2\x80\x9d She told him at once, in the plainest terms she could find,\r\nand with as few details as possible.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s profound bewilderment left him conscious of but one\r\ndistinct result produced by the narrative on his own mind. The lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffer of Fifty Pounds Reward for the missing young lady ascended\r\ninstantly to a place in his estimation which it had never occupied\r\nuntil that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are entirely deprived of\r\npresent resources?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have sold my jewelry and my dresses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, impatient of\r\nhis mean harping on the pecuniary string. \xe2\x80\x9cIf my want of experience\r\nkeeps me back in a theater, I can afford to wait till the stage can\r\nafford to pay me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge mentally appraised the rings, bracelets, and necklaces,\r\nthe silks, satins, and laces of the daughter of a gentleman of fortune,\r\nat\xe2\x80\x94say, a third of their real value. In a moment more, the Fifty Pounds\r\nReward suddenly sank again to the lowest depths in the deep estimation\r\nof this judicious man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his most business-like manner. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is not the\r\nleast fear, my dear girl, of your being kept back in a theater, if you\r\npossess present resources, and if you profit by my assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must accept more assistance than you have already offered\xe2\x80\x94or none,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI have more serious difficulties before me than the\r\ndifficulty of leaving York, and the difficulty of finding my way to the\r\nstage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so! I am all attention; pray explain yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe considered her next words carefully before they passed her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are certain inquiries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I am interested in\r\nmaking. If I undertook them myself, I should excite the suspicion of\r\nthe person inquired after, and should learn little or nothing of what I\r\nwish to know. If the inquiries could be made by a stranger, without my\r\nbeing seen in the matter, a service would be rendered me of much\r\ngreater importance than the service you offered last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s vagabond face became gravely and deeply attentive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the nature of the inquiries is likely to\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen hesitated. She had necessarily mentioned Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname in informing the captain of the loss of her inheritance. She must\r\ninevitably mention it to him again if she employed his services. He\r\nwould doubtless discover it for himself, by a plain process of\r\ninference, before she said many words more, frame them as carefully as\r\nshe might. Under these circumstances, was there any intelligible reason\r\nfor shrinking from direct reference to Michael Vanstone? No\r\nintelligible reason\xe2\x80\x94and yet she shrank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor instance,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Captain Wragge, \xe2\x80\x9care they inquiries about a man\r\nor a woman; inquiries about an enemy or a friend\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, quickly.\r\n\r\nHer reply might still have kept the captain in the dark\xe2\x80\x94but her eyes\r\nenlightened him. \xe2\x80\x9cMichael Vanstone!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the wary Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nlooks dangerous; I\xe2\x80\x99ll feel my way a little further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith regard, now, to the person who is the object of these inquiries,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you thoroughly clear in your own mind about what you\r\nwant to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly clear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know where he lives, to\r\nbegin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And after that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know about his habits; about who the people are whom he\r\nassociates with; about what he does with his money\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She considered a\r\nlittle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd one thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know whether there\r\nis any woman about his house\xe2\x80\x94a relation, or a housekeeper\xe2\x80\x94who has an\r\ninfluence over him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarmless enough, so far,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. The rest is my secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clouds on Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s countenance began to clear away again.\r\nHe reverted, with his customary precision, to his customary choice of\r\nalternatives. \xe2\x80\x9cThese inquiries of hers,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cmean one of two\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94Mischief, or Money! If it\xe2\x80\x99s Mischief, I\xe2\x80\x99ll slip through her\r\nfingers. If it\xe2\x80\x99s Money, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make myself useful, with a view to the\r\nfuture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s vigilant eyes watched the progress of his reflections\r\nsuspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Wragge,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you want time to\r\nconsider, say so plainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cPlace your departure\r\nfrom York, your dramatic career, and your private inquiries under my\r\ncare. Here I am, unreservedly at your disposal. Say the word\xe2\x80\x94do you\r\ntake me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer heart beat fast; her lips turned dry\xe2\x80\x94but she said the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Magdalen sat silent, struggling with the vague dread\r\nof the future which had been roused in her mind by her own reply.\r\nCaptain Wragge, on his side, was apparently absorbed in the\r\nconsideration of a new set of alternatives. His hands descended into\r\nhis empty pockets, and prophetically tested their capacity as\r\nreceptacles for gold and silver. The brightness of the precious metals\r\nwas in his face, the smoothness of the precious metals was in his\r\nvoice, as he provided himself with a new supply of words, and resumed\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the question of time. Do these\r\nconfidential investigations of ours require immediate attention\xe2\x80\x94or can\r\nthey wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the present, they can wait,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to secure\r\nmy freedom from all interference on the part of my friends before the\r\ninquiries are made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. The first step toward accomplishing that object is to beat\r\nour retreat\xe2\x80\x94excuse a professional metaphor from a military man\xe2\x80\x94to beat\r\nour retreat from York to-morrow. I see my way plainly so far; but I am\r\nall abroad, as we used to say in the militia, about my marching orders\r\nafterward. The next direction we take ought to be chosen with an eye to\r\nadvancing your dramatic views. I am all ready, when I know what your\r\nviews are. How came you to think of the theater at all? I see the\r\nsacred fire burning in you; tell me, who lit it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen could only answer him in one way. She could only look back at\r\nthe days that were gone forever, and tell him the story of her first\r\nstep toward the stage at Evergreen Lodge. Captain Wragge listened with\r\nhis usual politeness; but he evidently derived no satisfactory\r\nimpression from what he heard. Audiences of friends were audiences whom\r\nhe privately declined to trust; and the opinion of the stage-manager\r\nwas the opinion of a man who spoke with his fee in his pocket and his\r\neye on a future engagement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInteresting, deeply interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when Magdalen had done.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not conclusive to a practical man. A specimen of your abilities is\r\nnecessary to enlighten me. I have been on the stage myself; the comedy\r\nof the Rivals is familiar to me from beginning to end. A sample is all\r\nI want, if you have not forgotten the words\xe2\x80\x94a sample of \xe2\x80\x98Lucy,\xe2\x80\x99 and a\r\nsample of \xe2\x80\x98Julia.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not forgotten the words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, sorrowfully; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nhave the little books with me in which my dialogue was written out. I\r\nhave never parted with them; they remind me of a time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Her lip\r\ntrembled, and a pang of the heart-ache silenced her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNervous,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the captain, indulgently. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all a bad sign.\r\nThe greatest actresses on the stage are nervous. Follow their example,\r\nand get over it. Where are the parts? Oh, here they are! Very nicely\r\nwritten, and remarkably clean. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the cues\xe2\x80\x94it will all be\r\nover (as the dentists say) in no time. Take the back drawing-room for\r\nthe stage, and take me for the audience. Tingle goes the bell; up runs\r\nthe curtain; order in the gallery, silence in the pit\xe2\x80\x94enter Lucy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried hard to control herself; she forced back the sorrow\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ninnocent, natural, human sorrow for the absent and the dead\xe2\x80\x94pleading\r\nhard with her for the tears that she refused. Resolutely, with cold,\r\nclinched hands, she tried to begin. As the first familiar words passed\r\nher lips, Frank came back to her from the sea, and the face of her dead\r\nfather looked at her with the smile of happy old times. The voices of\r\nher mother and her sister talked gently in the fragrant country\r\nstillness, and the garden-walks at Combe-Raven opened once more on her\r\nview. With a faint, wailing cry, she dropped into a chair; her head\r\nfell forward on the table, and she burst passionately into tears.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge was on his feet in a moment. She shuddered as he came\r\nnear her, and waved him back vehemently with her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cleave me a minute by myself!\xe2\x80\x9d The compliant Wragge retired to\r\nthe front room; looked out of the window; and whistled under his\r\nbreath. \xe2\x80\x9cThe family spirit again!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cComplicated by hysterics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a minute or two he returned to make inquiries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything I can offer you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cCold water? burned\r\nfeathers? smelling salts? medical assistance? Shall I summon Mrs.\r\nWragge? Shall we put it off till to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started up, wild and flushed, with a desperate self-command in her\r\nface, with an angry resolution in her manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must harden myself\xe2\x80\x94and I will! Sit down again and\r\nsee me act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cDash at it, my beauty\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dashed at it, with a mad defiance of herself\xe2\x80\x94with a raised voice,\r\nand a glow like fever in her cheeks. All the artless, girlish charm of\r\nthe performance in happier and better days was gone. The native\r\ndramatic capacity that was in her came, hard and bold, to the surface,\r\nstripped of every softening allurement which had once adorned it. She\r\nwould have saddened and disappointed a man with any delicacy of\r\nfeeling. She absolutely electrified Captain Wragge. He forgot his\r\npoliteness, he forgot his long words. The essential spirit of the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhole vagabond life burst out of him irresistibly in his first\r\nexclamation. \xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil would have thought it? She _can_ act, after\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d The instant the words escaped his lips he recovered himself, and\r\nglided off into his ordinary colloquial channels. Magdalen stopped him\r\nin the middle of his first compliment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have forced\r\nthe truth out of you for once. I want no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the incorrigible Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want a little\r\ninstruction; and I am the man to give it you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that answer, he placed a chair for her, and proceeded to explain\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nShe sat down in silence. A sullen indifference began to show itself in\r\nher manner; her cheeks turned pale again; and her eyes looked wearily\r\nvacant at the wall before her. Captain Wragge noticed these signs of\r\nheart-sickness and discontent with herself, after the effort she had\r\nmade, and saw the importance of rousing her by speaking, for once,\r\nplainly and directly to the point. She had set a new value on herself\r\nin his mercenary eyes. She had suggested to him a speculation in her\r\nyouth, her beauty, and her marked ability for the stage, which had\r\nnever entered his mind until he saw her act. The old militia-man was\r\nquick at his shifts. He and his plans had both turned right about\r\ntogether when Magdalen sat down to hear what he had to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Huxtable\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a born\r\nactress. But you must be trained before you can do anything on the\r\nstage. I am disengaged\xe2\x80\x94I am competent\xe2\x80\x94I have trained others\xe2\x80\x94I can train\r\nyou. Don\xe2\x80\x99t trust my word: trust my eye to my own interests. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nit my interest to take pains with you, and to be quick about it. You\r\nshall pay me for my instructions from your profits on the stage. Half\r\nyour salary for the first year; a third of your salary for the second\r\nyear; and half the sum you clear by your first benefit in a London\r\ntheater. What do you say to that? Have I made it my interest to push\r\nyou, or have I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo far as appearances went, and so far as the stage went, it was plain\r\nthat he had linked his interests and Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s together. She briefly\r\ntold him so, and waited to hear more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA month or six weeks\xe2\x80\x99 study,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cwill give me a\r\nreasonable idea of what you can do best. All ability runs in grooves;\r\nand your groove remains to be found. We can\xe2\x80\x99t find it here\xe2\x80\x94for we can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nkeep you a close prisoner for weeks together in Rosemary Lane. A quiet\r\ncountry place, secure from all interference and interruption, is the\r\nplace we want for a month certain. Trust my knowledge of Yorkshire, and\r\nconsider the place found. I see no difficulties anywhere, except the\r\ndifficulty of beating our retreat to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought your arrangements were made last night?\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were made last night; and\r\nhere they are. We can\xe2\x80\x99t leave by railway, because the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk is\r\nsure to be on the lookout for you at the York terminus. Very good; we\r\ntake to the road instead, and leave in our own carriage. Where the\r\ndeuce do we get it? We get it from the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s brother, who has a\r\nhorse and chaise which he lets out for hire. That chaise comes to the\r\nend of Rosemary Lane at an early hour to-morrow morning. I take my wife\r\nand my niece out to show them the beauties of the neighborhood. We have\r\na picnic hamper with us, which marks our purpose in the public eye. You\r\ndisfigure yourself in a shawl, bonnet, and veil of Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s; we\r\nturn our backs on York; and away we drive on a pleasure trip for the\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94you and I on the front seat, Mrs. Wragge and the hamper behind.\r\nGood again. Once on the highroad, what do we do? Drive to the first\r\nstation beyond York, northward, southward, or eastward, as may be\r\nhereafter determined. No lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk is waiting for you there. You\r\nand Mrs. Wragge get out\xe2\x80\x94first opening the hamper at a convenient\r\nopportunity. Instead of containing chickens and Champagne, it contains\r\na carpet-bag, with the things you want for the night. You take your\r\ntickets for a place previously determined on, and I take the chaise\r\nback to York. Arrived once more in this house, I collect the luggage\r\nleft behind, and send for the woman downstairs. \xe2\x80\x98Ladies so charmed with\r\nsuch and such a place (wrong place of course), that they have\r\ndetermined to stop there. Pray accept the customary week\xe2\x80\x99s rent, in\r\nplace of a week\xe2\x80\x99s warning. Good day.\xe2\x80\x99 Is the clerk looking for me at\r\nthe York terminus? Not he. I take my ticket under his very nose; I\r\nfollow you with the luggage along your line of railway\xe2\x80\x94and where is the\r\ntrace left of your departure? Nowhere. The fairy has vanished; and the\r\nlegal authorities are left in the lurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you talk of difficulties?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulties\r\nseem to be provided for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll but ONE,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, with an ominous emphasis on the\r\nlast word. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Grand Difficulty of humanity from the cradle to the\r\ngrave\xe2\x80\x94Money.\xe2\x80\x9d He slowly winked his green eye; sighed with deep feeling;\r\nand buried his insolvent hands in his unproductive pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the money wanted for?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo pay my bills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, with a touching simplicity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray understand! I never was\xe2\x80\x94and never shall be\xe2\x80\x94personally desirous of\r\npaying a single farthing to any human creature on the habitable globe.\r\nI am speaking in your interest, not in mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy interest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get safely away from York to-morrow without the\r\nchaise. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t get the chaise without money. The landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother will lend it if he sees his sister\xe2\x80\x99s bill receipted, and if he\r\ngets his day\xe2\x80\x99s hire beforehand\xe2\x80\x94not otherwise. Allow me to put the\r\ntransaction in a business light. We have agreed that I am to be\r\nremunerated for my course of dramatic instruction out of your future\r\nearnings on the stage. Very good. I merely draw on my future prospects;\r\nand you, on whom those prospects depend, are naturally my banker. For\r\nmere argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, estimate my share in your first year\xe2\x80\x99s salary at\r\nthe totally inadequate value of a hundred pounds. Halve that sum;\r\nquarter that sum\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, impatiently.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge was sorely tempted to take the Reward at the top of the\r\nhandbills as his basis of calculation. But he felt the vast future\r\nimportance of present moderation; and actually wanting some twelve or\r\nthirteen pounds, he merely doubled the amount, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive-and-twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen took the little bag from her bosom, and gave him the money,\r\nwith a contemptuous wonder at the number of words which he had wasted\r\non her for the purpose of cheating on so small a scale. In the old days\r\nat Combe-Raven, five-and-twenty pounds flowed from a stroke of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s pen into the hands of any one in the house who chose to ask\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s eyes dwelt on the little bag as the eyes of lovers\r\ndwell on their mistresses. \xe2\x80\x9cHappy bag!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, as she put it back\r\nin her bosom. He rose; dived into a corner of the room; produced his\r\nneat dispatch-box; and solemnly unlocked it on the table between\r\nMagdalen and himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nature of the man, my dear girl\xe2\x80\x94the nature of the man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nopening one of his plump little books bound in calf and vellum. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\ntransaction has taken place between us. I must have it down in black\r\nand white.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened the book at a blank page, and wrote at the top,\r\nin a fine mercantile hand: \xe2\x80\x9c_Miss Vanstone, the Younger: In account\r\nwith Horatio Wragge, late of the Royal Militia. D_r.\xe2\x80\x94_C_r. _Sept._\r\n24_th_, 1846. _D_r_.: To estimated value of H. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s interest in\r\nMiss V.\xe2\x80\x98s first year\xe2\x80\x99s salary\xe2\x80\x94say_ \xc2\xa3 200. _C_r. _By paid on account_, \xc2\xa3\r\n25.\xe2\x80\x9d Having completed the entry\xe2\x80\x94and having also shown, by doubling his\r\noriginal estimate on the Debtor side, that Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s easy compliance\r\nwith his demand on her had not been thrown away on him\xe2\x80\x94the captain\r\npressed his blotting-paper over the wet ink, and put away the book with\r\nthe air of a man who had done a virtuous action, and who was above\r\nboasting about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me for leaving you abruptly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTime is of importance;\r\nI must make sure of the chaise. If Mrs. Wragge comes in, tell her\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94she is not sharp enough to be trusted. If she presumes to ask\r\nquestions, extinguish her immediately. You have only to be loud. Pray\r\ntake my authority into your own hands, and be as loud with Mrs. Wragge\r\nas I am!\xe2\x80\x9d He snatched up his tall hat, bowed, smiled, and tripped out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nSensible of little else but of the relief of being alone; feeling no\r\nmore distinct impression than the vague sense of some serious change\r\nhaving taken place in herself and her position, Magdalen let the events\r\nof the morning come and go like shadows on her mind, and waited wearily\r\nfor what the day might bring forth. After the lapse of some time, the\r\ndoor opened softly. The giant figure of Mrs. Wragge stalked into the\r\nroom, and stopped opposite Magdalen in solemn astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are your Things?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Wragge, with a burst of\r\nincontrollable anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been upstairs looking in your drawers.\r\nWhere are your night-gowns and night-caps? and your petticoats and\r\nstockings? and your hair-pins and bear\xe2\x80\x99s grease, and all the rest of\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy luggage is left at the railway station,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s moon-face brightened dimly. The ineradicable female\r\ninstinct of Curiosity tried to sparkle in her faded blue eyes\xe2\x80\x94flickered\r\npiteously\xe2\x80\x94and died out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much luggage?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, confidentially. \xe2\x80\x9cThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s gone out.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s go and get it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wragge!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a terrible voice at the door.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s experience, Mrs. Wragge was deaf to\r\nthe customary stimulant. She actually ventured on a feeble remonstrance\r\nin the presence of her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do let her have her Things!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor soul,\r\ndo let her have her Things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s inexorable forefinger pointed to a corner of the\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94dropped slowly as his wife retired before it\xe2\x80\x94and suddenly stopped\r\nat the region of her shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I hear a clapping on the floor!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Captain Wragge, with an\r\nexpression of horror. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I do. Down at heel again! The left shoe\r\nthis time. Pull it up, Mrs. Wragge! pull it up!\xe2\x80\x94The chaise will be here\r\nto-morrow morning at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, addressing Magdalen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly venture on claiming your box. There is note-paper.\r\nWrite down a list of the necessaries you want. I will take it myself to\r\nthe shop, pay the bill for you, and bring back the parcel. We must\r\nsacrifice the box\xe2\x80\x94we must, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile her husband was addressing Magdalen, Mrs. Wragge had stolen out\r\nagain from her corner, and had ventured near enough to the captain to\r\nhear the words \xe2\x80\x9cshop\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cparcel.\xe2\x80\x9d She clapped her great hands\r\ntogether in ungovernable excitement, and lost all control over herself\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if it\xe2\x80\x99s shopping, let me do it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nout to buy her Things! Oh, let me go with her\xe2\x80\x94please let me go with\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cStraight! more to the right\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nstill. Stop where you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge crossed her helpless hands on her lap, and melted meekly\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do so like shopping,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the poor creature; \xe2\x80\x9cand I get so\r\nlittle of it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen completed her list; and Captain Wragge at once left the room\r\nwith it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let my wife bore you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pleasantly, as he went\r\nout. \xe2\x80\x9cCut her short, poor soul\xe2\x80\x94cut her short!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, trying to comfort Mrs. Wragge by patting\r\nher on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the parcel comes back you shall open it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, meekly, drying her eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cthank\r\nyou kindly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t notice my handkerchief, please. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a very\r\nlittle one! I had a nice lot of them once, with lace borders. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall gone now. Never mind! It will comfort me to unpack your Things.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re very good to me. I like you. I say\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, will you?\r\nGive us a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen stooped over her with the frank grace and gentleness of past\r\ndays, and touched her faded cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me do something harmless!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, with a pang at her heart\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9coh let me do something innocent and\r\nkind for the sake of old times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt her eyes moistening, and silently turned away.\r\n\r\nThat night no rest came to her. That night the roused forces of Good\r\nand Evil fought their terrible fight for her soul\xe2\x80\x94and left the strife\r\nbetween them still in suspense when morning came. As the clock of York\r\nMinster struck nine, she followed Mrs. Wragge to the chaise, and took\r\nher seat by the captain\xe2\x80\x99s side. In a quarter of an hour more York was\r\nin the distance, and the highroad lay bright and open before them in\r\nthe morning sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\r\nCHRONICLE OF EVENTS: PRESERVED IN CAPTAIN WRAGGE\xe2\x80\x99S DESPATCH BOX.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nChronicle for October, 1846.\r\n\r\nI have retired into the bosom of my family. We are residing in the\r\nsecluded village of Ruswarp, on the banks of the Esk, about two miles\r\ninland from Whitby. Our lodgings are comfortable, and we possess the\r\nadditional blessing of a tidy landlady. Mrs. Wragge and Miss Vanstone\r\npreceded me here, in accordance with the plan I laid down for effecting\r\nour retreat from York. On the next day I followed them alone, with the\r\nluggage. On leaving the terminus, I had the satisfaction of seeing the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk in close confabulation with the detective officer whose\r\nadvent I had prophesied. I left him in peaceable possession of the city\r\nof York, and the whole surrounding neighborhood. He has returned the\r\ncompliment, and has left us in peaceable possession of the valley of\r\nthe Esk, thirty miles away from him.\r\n\r\nRemarkable results have followed my first efforts at the cultivation of\r\nMiss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic abilities.\r\n\r\nI have discovered that she possesses extraordinary talent as a mimic.\r\nShe has the flexible face, the manageable voice, and the dramatic knack\r\nwhich fit a woman for character-parts and disguises on the stage. All\r\nshe now wants is teaching and practice, to make her sure of her own\r\nresources. The experience of her, thus gained, has revived an idea in\r\nmy mind which originally occurred to me at one of the \xe2\x80\x9cAt Homes\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nlate inimitable Charles Mathews, comedian. I was in the Wine Trade at\r\nthe time, I remember. We imitated the Vintage-processes of Nature in a\r\nback-kitchen at Brompton, and produced a dinner-sherry, pale and\r\ncurious, tonic in character, round in the mouth, a favorite with the\r\nCourt of Spain, at nineteen-and-sixpence a dozen, bottles\r\nincluded\xe2\x80\x94_Vide_ Prospectus of the period. The profits of myself and\r\npartners were small; we were in advance of the tastes of the age, and\r\nin debt to the bottle merchant. Being at my wits\xe2\x80\x99 end for want of\r\nmoney, and seeing what audiences Mathews drew, the idea occurred to me\r\nof starting an imitation of the great Imitator himself, in the shape of\r\nan \xe2\x80\x9cAt Home,\xe2\x80\x9d given by a woman. The one trifling obstacle in the way\r\nwas the difficulty of finding the woman. From that time to this, I have\r\nhitherto failed to overcome it. I have conquered it at last; I have\r\nfound the woman now. Miss Vanstone possesses youth and beauty as well\r\nas talent. Train her in the art of dramatic disguise; provide her with\r\nappropriate dresses for different characters; develop her\r\naccomplishments in singing and playing; give her plenty of smart talk\r\naddressed to the audience; advertise her as a Young Lady at Home;\r\nastonish the public by a dramatic entertainment which depends from\r\nfirst to last on that young lady\xe2\x80\x99s own sole exertions; commit the\r\nentire management of the thing to my care\xe2\x80\x94and what follows as a\r\nnecessary con sequence? Fame for my fair relative, and a fortune for\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI put these considerations, as frankly as usual, to Miss Vanstone;\r\noffering to write the Entertainment, to manage all the business, and to\r\nshare the profits. I did not forget to strengthen my case by informing\r\nher of the jealousies she would encounter, and the obstacles she would\r\nmeet, if she went on the stage. And I wound up by a neat reference to\r\nthe private inquiries which she is interested in making, and to the\r\npersonal independence which she is desirous of securing before she acts\r\non her information. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go on the stage,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour services\r\nwill be bought by a manager, and he may insist on his claims just at\r\nthe time when you want to get free from him. If, on the contrary, you\r\nadopt my views, you will be your own mistress and your own manager, and\r\nyou can settle your course just as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d This last consideration\r\nappeared to strike her. She took a day to consider it; and, when the\r\nday was over, gave her consent.\r\n\r\nI had the whole transaction down in black and white immediately. Our\r\narrangement is eminently satisfactory, except in one particular. She\r\nshows a morbid distrust of writing her name at the bottom of any\r\ndocument which I present to her, and roundly declares she will sign\r\nnothing. As long as it is her interest to provide herself with\r\npecuniary resources for the future, she verbally engages to go on. When\r\nit ceases to be her interest, she plainly threatens to leave off at a\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s notice. A difficult girl to deal with; she has found out her own\r\nvalue to me already. One comfort is, I have the cooking of the\r\naccounts; and my fair relative shall not fill her pockets too suddenly\r\nif I can help it.\r\n\r\nMy exertions in training Miss Vanstone for the coming experiment have\r\nbeen varied by the writing of two anonymous letters in that young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s interests. Finding her too fidgety about arranging matters with\r\nher friends to pay proper attention to my instructions, I wrote\r\nanonymously to the lawyer who is conducting the inquiry after her,\r\nrecommending him, in a friendly way, to give it up. The letter was\r\ninclosed to a friend of mine in London, with instructions to post it at\r\nCharing Cross. A week later I sent a second letter, through the same\r\nchannel, requesting the lawyer to inform me, in writing, whether he and\r\nhis clients had or had not decided on taking my advice. I directed him,\r\nwith jocose reference to the collision of interests between us, to\r\naddress his letter: \xe2\x80\x9cTit for Tat, Post-office, West Strand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few days the answer arrived\xe2\x80\x94privately forwarded, of course, to\r\nPost-office, Whitby, by arrangement with my friend in London.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s reply was short and surly: \xe2\x80\x9cSIR\xe2\x80\x94If my advice had been\r\nfollowed, you and your anonymous letter would both be treated with the\r\ncontempt which they deserve. But the wishes of Miss Magdalen Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neldest sister have claims on my consideration which I cannot dispute;\r\nand at her entreaty I inform you that all further proceedings on my\r\npart are withdrawn\xe2\x80\x94on the express understanding that this concession is\r\nto open facilities for written communication, at least, between the two\r\nsisters. A letter from the elder Miss Vanstone is inclosed in this. If\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t hear in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time that it has been received, I shall place\r\nthe matter once more in the hands of the police.\xe2\x80\x94WILLIAM PENDRIL.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nsour man, this William Pendril. I can only say of him what an eminent\r\nnobleman once said of his sulky servant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have such a temper\r\nas that fellow has got for any earthly consideration that could be\r\noffered me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, I looked into the letter which the lawyer\r\ninclosed, before delivering it. Miss Vanstone, the elder, described\r\nherself as distracted at not hearing from her sister; as suited with a\r\ngoverness\xe2\x80\x99s situation in a private family; as going into the situation\r\nin a week\xe2\x80\x99s time; and as longing for a letter to comfort her, before\r\nshe faced the trial of undertaking her new duties. After closing the\r\nenvelope again, I accompanied the delivery of the letter to Miss\r\nVanstone, the younger, by a word of caution. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you more sure of your\r\nown courage now,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthan you were when I met you?\xe2\x80\x9d She was ready\r\nwith her answer. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Wragge, when you met me on the Walls of York\r\nI had not gone too far to go back. I have gone too far now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf she really feels this\xe2\x80\x94and I think she does\xe2\x80\x94her corresponding with\r\nher sister can do no harm. She wrote at great length the same day;\r\ncried profusely over her own epistolary composition; and was remarkably\r\nill-tempered and snappish toward me, when we met in the evening. She\r\nwants experience, poor girl\xe2\x80\x94she sadly wants experience of the world.\r\nHow consoling to know that I am just the man to give it her!\r\n\r\nII.\r\nChronicle for November.\r\n\r\nWe are established at Derby. The Entertainment is written; and the\r\nrehearsals are in steady progress. All difficulties are provided for,\r\nbut the one eternal difficulty of money. Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s resources\r\nstretch easily enough to the limits of our personal wants; including\r\npiano-forte hire for practice, and the purchase and making of the\r\nnecessary dresses. But the expenses of starting the Entertainment are\r\nbeyond the reach of any means we possess. A theatrical friend of mine\r\nhere, whom I had hoped to interest in our undertaking, proves,\r\nunhappily, to be at a crisis in his career. The field of human\r\nsympathy, out of which I might have raised the needful pecuniary crop,\r\nis closed to me from want of time to cultivate it. I see no other\r\nresource left\xe2\x80\x94if we are to be ready by Christmas\xe2\x80\x94than to try one of the\r\nlocal music-sellers in this town, who is said to be a speculating man.\r\nA private rehearsal at these lodgings, and a bargain which will fill\r\nthe pockets of a grasping stranger\xe2\x80\x94such are the sacrifices which dire\r\nnecessity imposes on me at starting. Well! there is only one\r\nconsolation: I\xe2\x80\x99ll cheat the music-seller.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nChronicle for December. First Fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe music-seller extorts my unwilling respect. He is one of the very\r\nfew human beings I have met with in the course of my life who is not to\r\nbe cheated. He has taken a masterly advantage of our helplessness; and\r\nhas imposed terms on us, for performances at Derby and Nottingham, with\r\nsuch a business-like disregard of all interests but his own that\xe2\x80\x94fond\r\nas I am of putting things down in black and white\xe2\x80\x94I really cannot\r\nprevail upon myself to record the bargain. It is needless to say, I\r\nhave yielded with my best grace; sharing with my fair relative the\r\nwretched pecuniary prospects offered to us. Our turn will come. In the\r\nmeantime, I cordially regret not having known the local music-seller in\r\nearly life.\r\n\r\nPersonally speaking, I have no cause to complain of Miss Vanstone. We\r\nhave arranged that she shall regularly forward her address (at the\r\npost-office) to her friends, as we move about from place to place.\r\nBesides communicating in this way with her sister, she also reports\r\nherself to a certain Mr. Clare, residing in Somersetshire, who is to\r\nforward all letters exchanged between herself and his son. Careful\r\ninquiry has informed me that this latter individual is now in China.\r\nHaving suspected from the first that there was a gentleman in the\r\nbackground, it is highly satisfactory to know that he recedes into the\r\nremote perspective of Asia. Long may he remain there!\r\n\r\nThe trifling responsibility of finding a name for our talented Magdalen\r\nto perform under has been cast on my shoulders. She feels no interest\r\nwhatever in this part of the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me any name you like,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cI have as much right to one as to another. Make it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nhave readily consented to gratify her wishes. The resources of my\r\ncommercial library include a list of useful names to assume; and we can\r\nchoose one at five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 notice, when the admirable man of business\r\nwho now oppresses us is ready to issue his advertisements. On this\r\npoint my mind is easy enough: all my anxieties center in the fair\r\nperformer. I have not the least doubt she will do wonders if she is\r\nonly left to herself on the first night. But if the day\xe2\x80\x99s post is\r\nmischievous enough to upset her by a letter from her sister, I tremble\r\nfor the consequences.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nChronicle for December. Second Fortnight.\r\n\r\nMy gifted relative has made her first appearance in public, and has\r\nlaid the foundation of our future fortunes.\r\n\r\nOn the first night the attendance was larger than I had ventured to\r\nhope. The novelty of an evening\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment, conducted from\r\nbeginning to end by the unaided exertions of a young lady (see\r\nadvertisement), roused the public curiosity, and the seats were\r\nmoderately well filled. As good luck would have it, no letter addressed\r\nto Miss Vanstone came that day. She was in full possession of herself\r\nuntil she got the first dress on and heard the bell ring for the music.\r\nAt that critical moment she suddenly broke down. I found her alone in\r\nthe waiting-room, sobbing, and talking like a child. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor papa!\r\npoor papa! Oh, my God, if he saw me now!\xe2\x80\x9d My experience in such matters\r\nat once informed me that it was a case of sal-volatile, accompanied by\r\nsound advice. We strung her up in no time to concert pitch; set her\r\neyes in a blaze; and made her out-blush her own rouge. The curtain rose\r\nwhen we had got her at a red heat. She dashed at it exactly as she\r\ndashed at it in the back drawing-room at Rosemary Lane. Her personal\r\nappearance settled the question of her reception before she opened her\r\nlips. She rushed full gallop through her changes of character, her\r\nsongs, and her dialogue; making mistakes by the dozen, and never\r\nstopping to set them right; carrying the people along with her in a\r\nperfect whirlwind, and never waiting for the applause. The whole thing\r\nwas over twenty minutes sooner than the time we had calculated on. She\r\ncarried it through to the end, and fainted on the waiting-room sofa a\r\nminute after the curtain was down. The music-seller having taken leave\r\nof his senses from sheer astonishment, and I having no evening costume\r\nto appear in, we sent the doctor to make the necessary apology to the\r\npublic, who were calling for her till the place rang again. I prompted\r\nour medical orator with a neat speech from behind the curtain; and I\r\nnever heard such applause, from such a comparatively small audience,\r\nbefore in my life. I felt the tribute\xe2\x80\x94I felt it deeply. Fourteen years\r\nago I scraped together the wretched means of existence in this very\r\ntown by reading the newspaper (with explanatory comments) to the\r\ncompany at a public-house. And now here I am at the top of the tree.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that my first proceeding was to bowl out the\r\nmusic-seller on the spot. He called the next morning, no doubt with a\r\nliberal proposal for extending the engagement beyond Derby and\r\nNottingham. My niece was described as not well enough to see him; and,\r\nwhen he asked for me, he was told I was not up. I happened to be at\r\nthat moment engaged in putting the case pathetically to our gifted\r\nMagdalen. Her answer was in the highest degree satisfactory. She would\r\npermanently engage herself to nobody\xe2\x80\x94least of all to a man who had\r\ntaken sordid advantage of her position and mine. She would be her own\r\nmistress, and share the profits with me, while she wanted money, and\r\nwhile it suited her to go on. So far so good. But the reason she added\r\nnext, for her flattering preference of myself, was less to my taste.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe music-seller is not the man whom I employ to make my inquiries,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the man.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t like her steadily remembering\r\nthose inquiries, in the first bewilderment of her success. It looks ill\r\nfor the future; it looks infernally ill for the future.\r\n\r\nV.\r\nChronicle for January, 1847.\r\n\r\nShe has shown the cloven foot already. I begin to be a little afraid of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the Nottingham engagement (the results of which\r\nmore than equaled the results at Derby), I proposed taking the\r\nentertainment next\xe2\x80\x94now we had got it into our own hands\xe2\x80\x94to Newark. Miss\r\nVanstone raised no objection until we came to the question of time,\r\nwhen she amazed me by stipulating for a week\xe2\x80\x99s delay before we appeared\r\nin public again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what possible purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the purpose of making the inquiries which I mentioned to you at\r\nYork,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nI instantly enlarged on the danger of delay, putting all the\r\nconsiderations before her in every imaginable form. She remained\r\nperfectly immovable. I tried to shake her on the question of expenses.\r\nShe answered by handing me over her share of the proceeds at Derby and\r\nNottingham\xe2\x80\x94and there were my expenses paid, at the rate of nearly two\r\nguineas a day. I wonder who first picked out a mule as the type of\r\nobstinacy? How little knowledge that man must have had of women!\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. I took down my instructions in black and\r\nwhite, as usual. My first exertions were to be directed to the\r\ndiscovery of Mr. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s address: I was also expected to\r\nfind out how long he was likely to live there, and whether he had sold\r\nCombe-Raven or not. My next inquiries were to inform me of his ordinary\r\nhabits of life; of what he did with his money; of who his intimate\r\nfriends were; and of the sort of terms on which his son, Mr. Noel\r\nVanstone, was now living with him. Lastly, the investigations were to\r\nend in discovering whether there was any female relative, or any woman\r\nexercising domestic authority in the house, who was known to have an\r\ninfluence over either father or son.\r\n\r\nIf my long practice in cultivating the field of human sympathy had not\r\naccustomed me to private investigations into the affairs of other\r\npeople, I might have found some of these queries rather difficult to\r\ndeal with in the course of a week. As it was, I gave myself all the\r\nbenefit of my own experience, and brought the answers back to\r\nNottingham in a day less than the given time. Here they are, in regular\r\norder, for convenience of future reference:\r\n\r\n(1.) Mr. Michael Vanstone is now residing at German Place, Brighton,\r\nand likely to remain there, as he finds the air suits him. He reached\r\nLondon from Switzerland in September last; and sold the Combe-Raven\r\nproperty immediately on his arrival.\r\n\r\n(2.) His ordinary habits of life are secret and retired; he seldom\r\nvisits, or receives company. Part of his money is supposed to be in the\r\nFunds, and part laid out in railway investments, which have survived\r\nthe panic of eighteen hundred and forty-six, and are rapidly rising in\r\nvalue. He is said to be a bold speculator. Since his arrival in England\r\nhe has invested, with great judgment, in house property. He has some\r\nhouses in remote parts of London, and some houses in certain\r\nwatering-places on the east coast, which are shown to be advancing in\r\npublic repute. In all these cases he is reported to have made\r\nremarkably good bargains.\r\n\r\n(3.) It is not easy to discover who his intimate friends are. Two names\r\nonly have been ascertained. The first is Admiral Bartram; supposed to\r\nhave been under friendly obligations, in past years, to Mr. Michael\r\nVanstone. The second is Mr. George Bartram, nephew of the Admiral, and\r\nnow staying on a short visit in the house at German Place. Mr. George\r\nBartram is the son of the late Mr. Andrew Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s sister, also\r\ndeceased. He is therefore a cousin of Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s. This\r\nlast\xe2\x80\x94viz., Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94is in delicate health, and is living on\r\nexcellent terms with his father in German Place.\r\n\r\n(4.) There is no female relative in Mr. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\ncircle. But there is a housekeeper who has lived in his service ever\r\nsince his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death, and who has acquired a strong influence over\r\nboth father and son. She is a native of Switzerland, elderly, and a\r\nwidow. Her name is Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nOn placing these particulars in Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s hands, she made no\r\nremark, except to thank me. I endeavored to invite her confidence. No\r\nresults; nothing but a renewal of civility, and a sudden shifting to\r\nthe subject of the Entertainment. Very good. If she won\xe2\x80\x99t give me the\r\ninformation I want, the conclusion is obvious\xe2\x80\x94I must help myself.\r\n\r\nBusiness considerations claim the remainder of this page.

We open the first week in February.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nChronicle for February.\r\n\r\nPractice has now given my fair relative the confidence which I\r\npredicted would come with time. Her knack of disguising her own\r\nidentity in the impersonation of different characters so completely\r\nstaggers her audiences that the same people come twice over to find out\r\nhow she does it. It is the amiable defect of the English public never\r\nto know when they have had enough of a good thing. They actually try to\r\nencore one of her characters\xe2\x80\x94an old north-country lady; modeled on that\r\nhonored preceptress in the late Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s family to whom I\r\npresented myself at Combe-Raven. This particular performance fairly\r\namazes the people. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at it. Such an extraordinary\r\nassumption of age by a girl of nineteen has never been seen in public\r\nbefore, in the whole course of my theatrical experience.\r\n\r\nI find myself writing in a lower tone than usual; I miss my own dash of\r\nhumor. The fact is, I am depressed about the future. In the very height\r\nof our prosperity my perverse pupil sticks to her trumpery family\r\nquarrel. I feel myself at the mercy of the first whim in the Vanstone\r\ndirection which may come into her head\xe2\x80\x94I, the architect of her\r\nfortunes. Too bad; upon my soul, too bad.\r\n\r\nShe has acted already on the inquiries which she forced me to make for\r\nher. She has written two letters to Mr. Michael Vanstone.\r\n\r\nTo the first letter no answer came. To the second a reply was received.\r\nHer infernal cleverness put an obstacle I had not expected in the way\r\nof my intercepting it. Later in the day, after she had herself opened\r\nand read the answer, I laid another trap for her. It just succeeded,\r\nand no more. I had half a minute to look into the envelope in her\r\nabsence. It contained nothing but her own letter returned. She is not\r\nthe girl to put up quietly with such an insult as this. Mischief will\r\ncome of it\xe2\x80\x94Mischief to Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94which is of no earthly\r\nconsequence: mischief to Me\xe2\x80\x94which is a truly serious matter.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nChronicle for March.\r\n\r\nAfter performing at Sheffield and Manchester, we have moved to\r\nLiverpool, Preston, and Lancaster. Another change in this weathercock\r\nof a girl. She has written no more letters to Michael Vanstone; and she\r\nhas become as anxious to make money as I am myself. We are realizing\r\nlarge profits, and we are worked to death. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this change in\r\nher: she has a purpose to answer, or she would not show such\r\nextraordinary eagerness to fill her purse. Nothing I can do\xe2\x80\x94no cooking\r\nof accounts; no self-presented testimonials\xe2\x80\x94can keep that purse empty.\r\nThe success of the Entertainment, and her own sharpness in looking\r\nafter her interests, literally force me into a course of comparative\r\nhonesty. She puts into her pocket more than a third of the profits, in\r\ndefiance of my most arduous exertions to prevent her. And this at my\r\nage! this after my long and successful career as a moral agriculturist!\r\nMarks of admiration are very little things; but they express my\r\nfeelings, and I put them in freely.\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nChronicle for April and May.\r\n\r\nWe have visited seven more large towns, and are now at Birmingham.\r\nConsulting my books, I find that Miss Vanstone has realized by the\r\nEntertainment, up to this time, the enormous sum of nearly four hundred\r\npounds. It is quite possible that my own profits may reach one or two\r\nmiserable hundred more. But I was the architect of her fortunes\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npublisher, so to speak, of her book\xe2\x80\x94and, if anything, I am underpaid.\r\n\r\nI made the above discovery on the twenty-ninth of the month\xe2\x80\x94anniversary\r\nof the Restoration of my royal predecessor in the field of human\r\nsympathies, Charles the Second. I had barely finished locking up my\r\ndispatch-box, when the ungrateful girl, whose reputation I have made,\r\ncame into the room and told me in so many words that the business\r\nconnection between us was for the present at an end.\r\n\r\nI attempt no description of my own sensations: I merely record facts.\r\nShe informed me, with an appearance of perfect composure, that she\r\nneeded rest, and that she had \xe2\x80\x9cnew objects in view.\xe2\x80\x9d She might possibly\r\nwant me to assist those objects; and she might possibly return to the\r\nEntertainment. In either case it would be enough if we exchanged\r\naddresses, at which we could write to each other in case of need.\r\nHaving no desire to leave me too abruptly, she would remain the next\r\nday (which was Sunday); and would take her departure on Monday morning.\r\nSuch was her explanation, in so many words.\r\n\r\nRemonstrance, as I knew by experience, would be thrown away. Authority\r\nI had none to exert. My one sensible course to take in this emergency\r\nwas to find out which way my own interests pointed, and to go that way\r\nwithout a moment\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary hesitation.\r\n\r\nA very little reflection has since convinced me that she has a\r\ndeep-laid scheme against Michael Vanstone in view. She is young,\r\nhandsome, clever, and unscrupulous; she has made money to live on, and\r\nhas time at her disposal to find out the weak side of an old man; and\r\nshe is going to attack Mr. Michael Vanstone unawares with the\r\nlegitimate weapons of her sex. Is she likely to want me for such a\r\npurpose as this? Doubtful. Is she merely anxious to get rid of me on\r\neasy terms? Probable. Am I the sort of man to be treated in this way by\r\nmy own pupil? Decidedly not: I am the man to see my way through a neat\r\nsuccession of alternatives; and here they are:\r\n\r\nFirst alternative: To announce my compliance with her proposal; to\r\nexchange addresses with her; and then to keep my eye privately on all\r\nher future movements. Second alternative: to express fond anxiety in a\r\npaternal capacity; and to threaten giving the alarm to her sister and\r\nthe lawyer, if she persists in her design. Third alternative: to turn\r\nthe information I already possess to the best account, by making it a\r\nmarketable commodity between Mr. Michael Vanstone and myself. At\r\npresent I incline toward the last of these three courses. But my\r\ndecision is far too important to be hurried. To-day is only the\r\ntwenty-ninth. I will suspend my Chronicle of Events until Monday.\r\n\r\nMay 31st.\xe2\x80\x94My alternatives and her plans are both overthrown together.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper came in, as usual, after breakfast. I looked it over, and\r\ndiscovered this memorable entry among the obituary announcements of the\r\nday:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the 29th inst., at Brighton, Michael Vanstone, Esq., formerly of\r\nZurich, aged 77.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Vanstone was present in the room when I read those two startling\r\nlines. Her bonnet was on; her boxes were packed; she was waiting\r\nimpatiently until it was time to go to the train. I handed the paper to\r\nher, without a word on my side. Without a word on hers, she looked\r\nwhere I pointed, and read the news of Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nThe paper dropped out of her hand, and she suddenly pulled down her\r\nveil. I caught one glance at her face before she hid it from me. The\r\neffect on my mind was startling in the extreme. To put it with my\r\ncustomary dash of humor\xe2\x80\x94her face informed me that the most sensible\r\naction which Michael Vanstone, Esq., formerly of Zurich, had ever\r\nachieved in his life was the action he performed at Brighton on the\r\n29th instant.\r\n\r\nFinding the dead silence in the room singularly unpleasant under\r\nexisting circumstances, I thought I would make a remark. My regard for\r\nmy own interests supplied me with a subject. I mentioned the\r\nEntertainment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI presume we go on with our\r\nperformances as usual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, behind the veil. \xe2\x80\x9cWe go on with my inquiries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInquiries after a dead man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInquiries after the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Noel Vanstone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Mr. Noel Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot having a veil to put down over my own face, I stooped and picked up\r\nthe newspaper. Her devilish determination quite upset me for the\r\nmoment. I actually had to steady myself before I could speak to her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the new inquiries as harmless as the old ones?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite as harmless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I expected to find out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know whether Mr. Noel Vanstone remains at Brighton after the\r\nfuneral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf not, I shall want to know his new address wherever it may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And what next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to find out next if all the father\xe2\x80\x99s money goes to the\r\nson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to see her drift. The word money relieved me; I felt quite on\r\nmy own ground again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything more?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cMake sure, if you please, whether\r\nMrs. Lecount, the housekeeper, remains or not in Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice altered a little as she mentioned Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s name; she is\r\nevidently sharp enough to distrust the housekeeper already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy expenses are to be paid as usual?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen am I expected to leave for Brighton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and left the room. After a momentary doubt, I decided on\r\nexecuting the new commission. The more private inquiries I conduct for\r\nmy fair relative the harder she will find it to get rid of hers truly,\r\nHoratio Wragge.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to prevent my starting for Brighton to-morrow. So\r\nto-morrow I go. If Mr. Noel Vanstone succeeds to his father\xe2\x80\x99s property,\r\nhe is the only human being possessed of pecuniary blessings who fails\r\nto inspire me with a feeling of unmitigated envy.\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nChronicle for June.\r\n\r\n9th.\xe2\x80\x94I returned yesterday with my information. Here it is, privately\r\nnoted down for convenience of future reference:\r\n\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone has left Brighton, and has removed, for the purpose\r\nof transacting business in London, to one of his late father\xe2\x80\x99s empty\r\nhouses in Vauxhall Walk, Lambeth. This singularly mean selection of a\r\nplace of residence on the part of a gentleman of fortune looks as if\r\nMr. N. V. and his money were not easily parted.\r\n\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone has stepped into his father\xe2\x80\x99s shoes under the\r\nfollowing circumstances: Mr. Michael Vanstone appears to have died,\r\ncuriously enough, as Mr. Andrew Vanstone died\xe2\x80\x94intestate. With this\r\ndifference, however, in the two cases, that the younger brother left an\r\ninformal will, and the elder brother left no will at all. The hardest\r\nmen have their weaknesses; and Mr. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s weakness seems to\r\nhave been an insurmountable horror of contemplating the event of his\r\nown death. His son, his housekeeper, and his lawyer, had all three\r\ntried over and over again to get him to make a will; and had never\r\nshaken his obstinate resolution to put off performing the only business\r\nduty he was ever known to neglect. Two doctors attended him in his last\r\nillness; warned him that he was too old a man to hope to get over it;\r\nand warned him in vain. He announced his own positive determination not\r\nto die. His last words in this world (as I succeeded in discovering\r\nfrom the nurse who assisted Mrs. Lecount) were: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting better\r\nevery minute; send for the fly directly and take me out for a drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe same night Death proved to be the more obstinate of the two; and\r\nleft his son (and only child) to take the property in due course of\r\nlaw. Nobody doubts that the result would have been the same if a will\r\nhad been made. The father and son had every confidence in each other,\r\nand were known to have always lived together on the most friendly\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount remains with Mr. Noel Vanstone, in the same housekeeping\r\ncapacity which she filled with his father, and has accompanied him to\r\nthe new residence in Vauxhall Walk. She is acknowledged on all hands to\r\nhave been a sufferer by the turn events have taken. If Mr. Michael\r\nVanstone had made his will, there is no doubt she would have received a\r\nhandsome legacy. She is now left dependent on Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s sense\r\nof gratitude; and she is not at all likely, I should imagine, to let\r\nthat sense fall asleep for want of a little timely jogging. Whether my\r\nfair relative\xe2\x80\x99s future intentions in this quarter point toward Mischief\r\nor Money, is more than I can yet say. In either case, I venture to\r\npredict that she will find an awkward obstacle in Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nSo much for my information to the present date. The manner in which it\r\nwas received by Miss Vanstone showed the most ungrateful distrust of\r\nme. She confided nothing to my private ear but the expression of her\r\nbest thanks. A sharp girl\xe2\x80\x94a devilish sharp girl. But there is such a\r\nthing as bowling a man out once too often; especially when the name of\r\nthat man happens to be Wragge.\r\n\r\nNot a word more about the Entertainment; not a word more about moving\r\nfrom our present quarters. Very good. My right hand lays my left hand a\r\nwager. Ten to one, on her opening communications with the son as she\r\nopened them with the father. Ten to one, on her writing to Noel\r\nVanstone before the month is out.\r\n\r\n21st.\xe2\x80\x94She has written by to-day\xe2\x80\x99s post. A long letter, apparently\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nshe put two stamps on the envelope. (Private memorandum, addressed to\r\nmyself. Wait for the answer.)\r\n\r\n22d, 23d, 24th.\xe2\x80\x94(Private memorandum continued. Wait for the answer.)\r\n\r\n25th.\xe2\x80\x94The answer has come. As an ex-military man, I have naturally\r\nemployed stratagem to get at it. The success which rewards all genuine\r\nperseverance has rewarded me\xe2\x80\x94and I have got at it accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe letter is written, not by Mr. Noel Vanstone, but by Mrs. Lecount.\r\nShe takes the highest moral ground, in a tone of spiteful politeness.\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s delicate health and recent bereavement prevent him\r\nfrom writing himself. Any more letters from Miss Vanstone will be\r\nreturned unopened. Any personal application will produce an immediate\r\nappeal to the protection of the law. Mr. Noel Vanstone, having been\r\nexpressly cautioned against Miss Magdalen Vanstone by his late lamented\r\nfather, has not yet forgotten his father\xe2\x80\x99s advice. Considers it a\r\nreflection cast on the memory of the best of men, to suppose that his\r\ncourse of action toward the Misses Vanstone can be other than the\r\ncourse of action which his father pursued. This is what he has himself\r\ninstructed Mrs. Lecount to say. She has endeavored to express herself\r\nin the most conciliatory language she could select; she had tried to\r\navoid giving unnecessary pain, by addressing Miss Vanstone (as a matter\r\nof courtesy) by the family name; and she trusts these concessions,\r\nwhich speak for themselves, will not be thrown away.\xe2\x80\x94Such is the\r\nsubstance of the letter, and so it ends.\r\n\r\nI draw two conclusions from this little document. First\xe2\x80\x94that it will\r\nlead to serious results. Secondly\xe2\x80\x94that Mrs. Lecount, with all her\r\npoliteness, is a dangerous woman to deal with. I wish I saw my way safe\r\nbefore me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it yet.\r\n\r\n29th.\xe2\x80\x94Miss Vanstone has abandoned my protection; and the whole\r\nlucrative future of the dramatic entertainment has abandoned me with\r\nher. I am swindled\xe2\x80\x94I, the last man under heaven who could possibly have\r\nexpected to write in those disgraceful terms of myself\xe2\x80\x94I AM SWINDLED!\r\n\r\nLet me chronicle the events. They exhibit me, for the time being, in a\r\nsadly helpless point of view. But the nature of the man prevails: I\r\nmust have the events down in black and white.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of her approaching departure was intimated to me\r\nyesterday. After another civil speech about the information I had\r\nprocured at Brighton, she hinted that there was a necessity for pushing\r\nour inquiries a little further. I immediately offered to undertake\r\nthem, as before. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are not in your way this time.\r\nThey are inquiries relating to a woman; and I mean to make them\r\nmyself!\xe2\x80\x9d Feeling privately convinced that this new resolution pointed\r\nstraight at Mrs. Lecount, I tried a few innocent questions on the\r\nsubject. She quietly declined to answer them. I asked next when she\r\nproposed to leave. She would leave on the twenty-eighth. For what\r\ndestination? London. For long? Probably not. By herself? No. With me?\r\nNo. With whom then? With Mrs. Wragge, if I had no objection. Good\r\nheavens! for what possible purpose? For the purpose of getting a\r\nrespectable lodging, which she could hardly expect to accomplish unless\r\nshe was accompanied by an elderly female friend. And was I, in the\r\ncapacity of elderly male friend, to be left out of the business\r\naltogether? Impossible to say at present. Was I not even to forward any\r\nletters which might come for her at our present address? No: she would\r\nmake the arrangement herself at the post-office; and she would ask me,\r\nat the same time, for an address, at which I could receive a letter\r\nfrom her, in case of necessity for future communication. Further\r\ninquiries, after this last answer, could lead to nothing but waste of\r\ntime. I saved time by putting no more questions.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to me that our present position toward each other was what\r\nour position had been previously to the event of Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath. I returned, as before, to my choice of alternatives. Which way\r\ndid my private interests point? Toward trusting the chance of her\r\nwanting me again? Toward threatening her with the interference of her\r\nrelatives and friends? Or toward making the information which I\r\npossessed a marketable commodity between the wealthy branch of the\r\nfamily and myself? The last of the three was the alternative I had\r\nchosen in the case of the father. I chose it once more in the case of\r\nthe son.\r\n\r\nThe train started for London nearly four hours since, and took her away\r\nin it, accompanied by Mrs. Wragge.\r\n\r\nMy wife is too great a fool, poor soul, to be actively valuable in the\r\npresent emergency; but she will be passively useful in keeping up Miss\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s connection with me\xe2\x80\x94and, in consideration of that\r\ncircumstance, I consent to brush my own trousers, shave my own chin,\r\nand submit to the other inconveniences of waiting on myself for a\r\nlimited period. Any faint glimmerings of sense which Mrs. Wragge may\r\nhave formerly possessed appear to have now finally taken their leave of\r\nher. On receiving permission to go to London, she favored us\r\nimmediately with two inquiries. Might she do some shopping? and might\r\nshe leave the cookery-book behind her? Miss Vanstone said Yes to one\r\nquestion, and I said Yes to the other\xe2\x80\x94and from that moment, Mrs. Wragge\r\nhas existed in a state of perpetual laughter. I am still hoarse with\r\nvainly repeated applications of vocal stimulant; and I left her in the\r\nrailway carriage, to my inexpressible disgust, with _both_ shoes down\r\nat heel.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances these absurd particulars would not have\r\ndwelt on my memory. But, as matters actually stand, my unfortunate\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s imbecility may, in her present position, lead to consequences\r\nwhich we none of us foresee. She is nothing more or less than a\r\ngrown-up child; and I can plainly detect that Miss Vanstone trusts her,\r\nas she would not have trusted a sharper woman, on that very account. I\r\nknow children, little and big, rather better than my fair relative\r\ndoes; and I say\xe2\x80\x94beware of all forms of human innocence, when it happens\r\nto be your interest to keep a secret to yourself.\r\n\r\nLet me return to business. Here I am, at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock on a fine summer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nafternoon, left entirely alone, to consider the safest means of\r\napproaching Mr. Noel Vanstone on my own account. My private suspicions\r\nof his miserly character produce no discouraging effect on me. I have\r\nextracted cheering pecuniary results in my time from people quite as\r\nfond of their money as he can be. The real difficulty to contend with\r\nis the obstacle of Mrs. Lecount. If I am not mistaken, this lady merits\r\na little serious consideration on my part. I will close my chronicle\r\nfor to-day, and give Mrs. Lecount her due.\r\n\r\nThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x94I open these pages again to record a discovery which has\r\ntaken me entirely by surprise.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the last entry, a circumstance revived in my memory\r\nwhich I had noticed on escorting the ladies this morning to the\r\nrailway. I then remarked that Miss Vanstone had only taken one of her\r\nthree boxes with her\xe2\x80\x94and it now occurred to me that a private\r\ninvestigation of the luggage she had left behind might possibly be\r\nattended with beneficial results. Having, at certain periods of my life\r\nbeen in the habit of cultivating friendly terms with strange locks, I\r\nfound no difficulty in establishing myself on a familiar footing with\r\nMiss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s boxes. One of the two presented nothing to interest me.\r\nThe other\xe2\x80\x94devoted to the preservation of the costumes, articles of\r\ntoilet, and other properties used in the dramatic Entertainment\xe2\x80\x94proved\r\nto be better worth examining: for it led me straight to the discovery\r\nof one of its owner\xe2\x80\x99s secrets.\r\n\r\nI found all the dresses in the box complete\xe2\x80\x94with one remarkable\r\nexception. That exception was the dress of the old north-country lady;\r\nthe character which I have already mentioned as the best of all my\r\npupil\xe2\x80\x99s disguises, and as modeled in voice and manner on her old\r\ngoverness, Miss Garth. The wig; the eyebrows; the bonnet and veil; the\r\ncloak, padded inside to disfigure her back and shoulders; the paints\r\nand cosmetics used to age her face and alter her complexion\xe2\x80\x94were all\r\ngone. Nothing but the gown remained; a gaudily-flowered silk, useful\r\nenough for dramatic purposes, but too extravagant in color and pattern\r\nto bear inspection by daylight. The other parts of the dress are\r\nsufficiently quiet to pass muster; the bonnet and veil are only\r\nold-fashioned, and the cloak is of a sober gray color. But one plain\r\ninference can be drawn from such a discovery as this. As certainly as I\r\nsit here, she is going to open the campaign against Noel Vanstone and\r\nMrs. Lecount in a character which neither of those two persons can have\r\nany possible reason for suspecting at the outset\xe2\x80\x94the character of Miss\r\nGarth.\r\n\r\nWhat course am I to take under these circumstances? Having got her\r\nsecret, what am I to do with it? These are awkward considerations; I am\r\nrather puzzled how to deal with them.\r\n\r\nIt is something more than the mere fact of her choosing to disguise\r\nherself to forward her own private ends that causes my present\r\nperplexity. Hundreds of girls take fancies for disguising themselves;\r\nand hundreds of instances of it are related year after year in the\r\npublic journals. But my ex-pupil is not to be confounded for one moment\r\nwith the average adventuress of the newspapers. She is capable of going\r\na long way beyond the limit of dressing herself like a man, and\r\nimitating a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice and manner. She has a natural gift for assuming\r\ncharacters which I have never seen equaled by a woman; and she has\r\nperformed in public until she has felt her own power, and trained her\r\ntalent for disguising herself to the highest pitch. A girl who takes\r\nthe sharpest people unawares by using such a capacity as this to help\r\nher own objects in private life, and who sharpens that capacity by a\r\ndetermination to fight her way to her own purpose, which has beaten\r\ndown everything before it, up to this time\xe2\x80\x94is a girl who tries an\r\nexperiment in deception, new enough and dangerous enough to lead, one\r\nway or the other, to very serious results. This is my conviction,\r\nfounded on a large experience in the art of imposing on my\r\nfellow-creatures. I say of my fair relative\xe2\x80\x99s enterprise what I never\r\nsaid or thought of it till I introduced myself to the inside of her\r\nbox. The chances for and against her winning the fight for her lost\r\nfortune are now so evenly balanced that I cannot for the life of me see\r\non which side the scale inclines. All I can discern is, that it will,\r\nto a dead certainty, turn one way or the other on the day when she\r\npasses Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s doors in disguise.\r\n\r\nWhich way do my interests point now? Upon my honor, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\nFive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x94I have effected a masterly compromise; I have decided on\r\nturning myself into a Jack-on-both-sides.\r\n\r\nBy to-day\xe2\x80\x99s post I have dispatched to London an anonymous letter for\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone. It will be forwarded to its destination by the same\r\nmeans which I successfully adopted to mystify Mr. Pendril; and it will\r\nreach Vauxhall Walk, Lambeth, by the afternoon of to-morrow at the\r\nlatest.\r\n\r\nThe letter is short, and to the purpose. It warns Mr. Noel Vanstone, in\r\nthe most alarming language, that he is destined to become the victim of\r\na conspiracy; and that the prime mover of it is a young lady who has\r\nalready held written communication with his father and himself. It\r\noffers him the information necessary to secure his own safety, on\r\ncondition that he makes it worth the writer\xe2\x80\x99s while to run the serious\r\npersonal risk which such a disclosure will entail on him. And it ends\r\nby stipulating that the answer shall be advertised in the _Times_;\r\nshall be addressed to \xe2\x80\x9cAn Unknown Friend\xe2\x80\x9d; and shall state plainly what\r\nremuneration Mr. Noel Vanstone offers for the priceless service which\r\nit is proposed to render him.\r\n\r\nUnless some unexpected complication occurs, this letter places me\r\nexactly in the position which it is my present interest to occupy. If\r\nthe advertisement appears, and if the remuneration offered is large\r\nenough to justify me in going over to the camp of the enemy, over I go.\r\nIf no advertisement appears, or if Mr. Noel Vanstone rates my\r\ninvaluable assistance at too low a figure, here I remain, biding my\r\ntime till my fair relative wants me, or till I make her want me, which\r\ncomes to the same thing. If the anonymous letter falls by any accident\r\ninto her hands, she will find disparaging allusions in it to myself,\r\npurposely introduced to suggest that the writer must be one of the\r\npersons whom I addressed while conducting her inquiries. If Mrs.\r\nLecount takes the business in hand and lays a trap for me\xe2\x80\x94I decline her\r\ntempting invitation by becoming totally ignorant of the whole affair\r\nthe instant any second person appears in it. Let the end come as it\r\nmay, here I am ready to profit by it: here I am, facing both ways, with\r\nperfect ease and security\xe2\x80\x94a moral agriculturist, with his eye on two\r\ncrops at once, and his swindler\xe2\x80\x99s sickle ready for any emergency.\r\n\r\nFor the next week to come, the newspaper will be more interesting to me\r\nthan ever. I wonder which side I shall eventually belong to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD SCENE.\r\nVAUXHALL WALK, LAMBETH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe old Archiepiscopal Palace of Lambeth, on the southern bank of the\r\nThames\xe2\x80\x94with its Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s Walk and Garden, and its terrace fronting the\r\nriver\xe2\x80\x94is an architectural relic of the London of former times, precious\r\nto all lovers of the picturesque, in the utilitarian London of the\r\npresent day. Southward of this venerable structure lies the street\r\nlabyrinth of Lambeth; and nearly midway, in that part of the maze of\r\nhouses which is placed nearest to the river, runs the dingy double row\r\nof buildings now, as in former days, known by the name of Vauxhall\r\nWalk.\r\n\r\nThe network of dismal streets stretching over the surrounding\r\nneighborhood contains a population for the most part of the poorer\r\norder. In the thoroughfares where shops abound, the sordid struggle\r\nwith poverty shows itself unreservedly on the filthy pavement; gathers\r\nits forces through the week; and, strengthening to a tumult on Saturday\r\nnight, sees the Sunday morning dawn in murky gaslight. Miserable women,\r\nwhose faces never smile, haunt the butchers\xe2\x80\x99 shops in such London\r\nlocalities as these, with relics of the men\xe2\x80\x99s wages saved from the\r\npublic-house clutched fast in their hands, with eyes that devour the\r\nmeat they dare not buy, with eager fingers that touch it covetously, as\r\nthe fingers of their richer sisters touch a precious stone. In this\r\ndistrict, as in other districts remote from the wealthy quarters of the\r\nmetropolis, the hideous London vagabond\xe2\x80\x94with the filth of the street\r\noutmatched in his speech, with the mud of the street outdirtied in his\r\nclothes\xe2\x80\x94lounges, lowering and brutal, at the street corner and the\r\ngin-shop door; the public disgrace of his country, the unheeded warning\r\nof social troubles that are yet to come. Here, the loud self-assertion\r\nof Modern Progress\xe2\x80\x94which has reformed so much in manners, and altered\r\nso little in men\xe2\x80\x94meets the flat contradiction that scatters its\r\npretensions to the winds. Here, while the national prosperity feasts,\r\nlike another Belshazzar, on the spectacle of its own magnificence, is\r\nthe Writing on the Wall, which warns the monarch, Money, that his glory\r\nis weighed in the balance, and his power found wanting.\r\n\r\nSituated in such a neighborhood as this, Vauxhall Walk gains by\r\ncomparison, and establishes claims to respectability which no impartial\r\nobservation can fail to recognize. A large proportion of the Walk is\r\nstill composed of private houses. In the scattered situations where\r\nshops appear, those shops are not besieged by the crowds of more\r\npopulous thoroughfares. Commerce is not turbulent, nor is the public\r\nconsumer besieged by loud invitations to \xe2\x80\x9cbuy.\xe2\x80\x9d Bird-fanciers have\r\nsought the congenial tranquillity of the scene; and pigeons coo, and\r\ncanaries twitter, in Vauxhall Walk. Second-hand carts and cabs,\r\nbedsteads of a certain age, detached carriage-wheels for those who may\r\nwant one to make up a set, are all to be found here in the same\r\nrepository. One tributary stream, in the great flood of gas which\r\nilluminates London, tracks its parent source to Works established in\r\nthis locality. Here the followers of John Wesley have set up a temple,\r\nbuilt before the period of Methodist conversion to the principles of\r\narchitectural religion. And here\xe2\x80\x94most striking object of all\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nsite where thousands of lights once sparkled; where sweet sounds of\r\nmusic made night tuneful till morning dawned; where the beauty and\r\nfashion of London feasted and danced through the summer seasons of a\r\ncentury\xe2\x80\x94spreads, at this day, an awful wilderness of mud and rubbish;\r\nthe deserted dead body of Vauxhall Gardens mouldering in the open air.\r\n\r\nOn the same day when Captain Wragge completed the last entry in his\r\nChronicle of Events, a woman appeared at the window of one of the\r\nhouses in Vauxhall Walk, and removed from the glass a printed paper\r\nwhich had been wafered to it announcing that Apartments were to be let.\r\nThe apartments consisted of two rooms on the first floor. They had just\r\nbeen taken for a week certain by two ladies who had paid in\r\nadvance\xe2\x80\x94those two ladies being Magdalen and Mrs. Wragge.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the mistress of the house had left the room, Magdalen walked\r\nto the window, and cautiously looked out from it at the row of\r\nbuildings opposite. They were of superior pretensions in size and\r\nappearance to the other houses in the Walk: the date at which they had\r\nbeen erected was inscribed on one of them, and was stated to be the\r\nyear 1759. They stood back from the pavement, separated from it by\r\nlittle strips of garden-ground. This peculiarity of position, added to\r\nthe breadth of the roadway interposing between them and the smaller\r\nhouses opposite, made it impossible for Magdalen to see the numbers on\r\nthe doors, or to observe more of any one who might come to the windows\r\nthan the bare general outline of dress and figure. Nevertheless, there\r\nshe stood, anxiously fixing her eyes on one house in the row, nearly\r\nopposite to her\xe2\x80\x94the house she had looked for before entering the\r\nlodgings; the house inhabited at that moment by Noel Vanstone and Mrs.\r\nLecount.\r\n\r\nAfter keeping watch at the window in silence for ten minutes or more,\r\nshe suddenly looked back into the room, to observe the effect which her\r\nbehavior might have produced on her traveling companion.\r\n\r\nNot the slightest cause appeared for any apprehension in that quarter.\r\nMrs. Wragge was seated at the table absorbed in the arrangement of a\r\nseries of smart circulars and tempting price-lists, issued by\r\nadvertising trades-people, and flung in at the cab-windows as they left\r\nthe London terminus. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often heard tell of light reading,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Wragge, restlessly shifting the positions of the circulars as a\r\nchild restlessly shifts the position of a new set of toys. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlight reading, printed in pretty colors. Here\xe2\x80\x99s all the Things I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to buy when I\xe2\x80\x99m out shopping to-morrow. Lend us a pencil,\r\nplease\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, will you? I do so want to mark \xe2\x80\x99em off.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlooked up at Magdalen, chuckled joyfully over her own altered\r\ncircumstances, and beat her great hands on the table in irrepressible\r\ndelight. \xe2\x80\x9cNo cookery-book!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cNo Buzzing in my head!\r\nno captain to shave to-morrow! I\xe2\x80\x99m all down at heel; my cap\xe2\x80\x99s on one\r\nside; and nobody bawls at me. My heart alive, here _is_ a holiday and\r\nno mistake!\xe2\x80\x9d Her hands began to drum on the table louder than ever,\r\nuntil Magdalen quieted them by presenting her with a pencil. Mrs.\r\nWragge instantly recovered her dignity, squared her elbows on the\r\ntable, and plunged into imaginary shopping for the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\nMagdalen returned to the window. She took a chair, seated herself\r\nbehind the curtain, and steadily fixed her eyes once more on the house\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nThe blinds were down over the windows of the first floor and the\r\nsecond. The window of the room on the ground-floor was uncovered and\r\npartly open, but no living creature came near it. Doors opened, and\r\npeople came and went, in the houses on either side; children by the\r\ndozen poured out on the pavement to play, and invaded the little strips\r\nof garden-ground to recover lost balls and shuttlecocks; streams of\r\npeople passed backward and forward perpetually; heavy wagons piled high\r\nwith goods lumbered along the road on their way to, or their way from,\r\nthe railway station near; all the daily life of the district stirred\r\nwith its ceaseless activity in every direction but one. The hours\r\npassed\xe2\x80\x94and there was the house opposite still shut up, still void of\r\nany signs of human existence inside or out. The one object which had\r\ndecided Magdalen on personally venturing herself in Vauxhall Walk\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nobject of studying the looks, manners and habits of Mrs. Lecount and\r\nher master from a post of observation known only to herself\xe2\x80\x94was thus\r\nfar utterly defeated. After three hours\xe2\x80\x99 watching at the window, she\r\nhad not even discovered enough to show her that the house was inhabited\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nShortly after six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the landlady disturbed Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s studies\r\nby spreading the cloth for dinner. Magdalen placed herself at the table\r\nin a position which still enabled her to command the view from the\r\nwindow. Nothing happened. The dinner came to an end; Mrs. Wragge\r\n(lulled by the narcotic influence of annotating circulars, and eating\r\nand drinking with an appetite sharpened by the captain\xe2\x80\x99s absence)\r\nwithdrew to an arm-chair, and fell asleep in an attitude which would\r\nhave caused her husband the acutest mental suffering; seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nstruck; the shadows of the summer evening lengthened stealthily on the\r\ngray pavement and the brown house-walls\xe2\x80\x94and still the closed door\r\nopposite remained shut; still the one window open showed nothing but\r\nthe black blank of the room inside, lifeless and changeless as if that\r\nroom had been a tomb.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s meek snoring deepened in tone; the evening wore on\r\ndrearily; it was close on eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94when an event happened at last.\r\nThe street door opposite opened for the first time, and a woman\r\nappeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\nWas the woman Mrs. Lecount? No. As she came nearer, her dress showed\r\nher to be a servant. She had a large door-key in her hand, and was\r\nevidently going out to perform an errand. Roused partly by curiosity,\r\npartly by the impulse of the moment, which urged her impetuous nature\r\ninto action after the passive endurance of many hours past, Magdalen\r\nsnatched up her bonnet, and determined to follow the servant to her\r\ndestination, wherever it might be.\r\n\r\nThe woman led her to the great thoroughfare of shops close at hand,\r\ncalled Lambeth Walk. After proceeding some little distance, and looking\r\nabout her with the hesitation of a person not well acquainted with the\r\nneighborhood, the servant crossed the road and entered a stationer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop. Magdalen crossed the road after her and followed her in.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable delay in entering the shop under these circumstances\r\nmade Magdalen too late to hear what the woman asked for. The first\r\nwords spoken, however, by the man behind the counter reached her ears,\r\nand informed her that the servant\xe2\x80\x99s object was to buy a railway guide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean a Guide for this month or a Guide for July?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nshopman, addressing his customer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me which,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing into the country the day after to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day after to-morrow is the first of July,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nGuide your master wants is the Guide for the new month. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\npublished till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEngaging to call again on the next day, the servant left the shop, and\r\ntook the way that led back to Vauxhall Walk.\r\n\r\nMagdalen purchased the first trifle she saw on the counter, and hastily\r\nreturned in the same direction. The discovery she had just made was of\r\nvery serious importance to her; and she felt the necessity of acting on\r\nit with as little delay as possible.\r\n\r\nOn entering the front room at the lodgings she found Mrs. Wragge just\r\nawake, lost in drowsy bewilderment, with her cap fallen off on her\r\nshoulders, and with one of her shoes missing altogether. Magdalen\r\nendeavored to persuade her that she was tired after her journey, and\r\nthat her wisest proceeding would be to go to bed. Mrs. Wragge was\r\nperfectly willing to profit by this suggestion, provided she could find\r\nher shoe first. In looking for the shoe, she unfortunately discovered\r\nthe circulars, put by on a side-table, and forthwith recovered her\r\nrecollection of the earlier proceedings of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us the pencil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, shuffling the circulars in a\r\nviolent hurry. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed yet\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t half done marking down\r\nthe things I want. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see; where did I leave off? _Try Finch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeding-bottle for Infants._ No! there\xe2\x80\x99s a cross against that: the\r\ncross means I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it. _Comfort in the Field. Buckler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nIndestructible Hunting-breeches._ Oh dear, dear! I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the place.\r\nNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. Here it is; here\xe2\x80\x99s my mark against it. _Elegant Cashmere\r\nRobes; strictly Oriental, very grand; reduced to one pound\r\nnineteen-and-sixpence. Be in time. Only three left._ Only three! Oh, do\r\nlend us the money, and let\xe2\x80\x99s go and get one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you go to bed now, and finish\r\nthe circulars tomorrow? I will put them by the bedside for you, and you\r\ncan go on with them as soon as you wake the first thing in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis suggestion met with Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s immediate approval. Magdalen\r\ntook her into the next room and put her to bed like a child\xe2\x80\x94with her\r\ntoys by her side. The room was so narrow, and the bed was so small; and\r\nMrs. Wragge, arrayed in the white apparel proper for the occasion, with\r\nher moon-face framed round by a spacious halo of night-cap, looked so\r\nhugely and disproportionately large, that Magdalen, anxious as she was,\r\ncould not repress a smile on taking leave of her traveling companion\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge, cheerfully; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have that Cashmere Robe\r\nto-morrow. Come here! I want to whisper something to you. Just you look\r\nat me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sleep crooked, and the captain\xe2\x80\x99s not here to bawl at\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe front room at the lodgings contained a sofa-bedstead which the\r\nlandlady arranged betimes for the night. This done, and the candles\r\nbrought in, Magdalen was left alone to shape the future course as her\r\nown thoughts counseled her.\r\n\r\nThe questions and answers which had passed in her presence that evening\r\nat the stationer\xe2\x80\x99s shop led plainly to the conclusion that one day more\r\nwould bring Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s present term of residence in Vauxhall Walk\r\nto an end. Her first cautious resolution to pass many days together in\r\nunsuspected observation of the house opposite before she ventured\r\nherself inside was entirely frustrated by the turn events had taken.\r\nShe was placed in the dilemma of running all risks headlong on the next\r\nday, or of pausing for a future opportunity which might never occur.\r\nThere was no middle course open to her. Until she had seen Noel\r\nVanstone with her own eyes, and had discovered the worst there was to\r\nfear from Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x94until she had achieved this double object, with\r\nthe needful precaution of keeping her own identity carefully in the\r\ndark\xe2\x80\x94not a step could she advance toward the accomplishment of the\r\npurpose which had brought her to London.\r\n\r\nOne after another the minutes of the night passed away; one after\r\nanother the thronging thoughts followed each other over her mind\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nstill she reached no conclusion; still she faltered and doubted, with a\r\nhesitation new to her in her experience of herself. At last she crossed\r\nthe room impatiently to seek the trivial relief of unlocking her trunk\r\nand taking from it the few things that she wanted for the night.\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions had not misled him. There, hidden between\r\ntwo dresses, were the articles of costume which he had missed from her\r\nbox at Birmingham. She turned them over one by one, to satisfy herself\r\nthat nothing she wanted had been forgotten, and returned once more to\r\nher post of observation by the window.\r\n\r\nThe house opposite was dark down to the parlor. There the blind,\r\npreviously raised, was now drawn over the window: the light burning\r\nbehind it showed her for the first time that the room was inhabited.\r\nHer eyes brightened, and her color rose as she looked at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, in a low, angry whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThere he\r\nlives on our money, in the house that his father\xe2\x80\x99s warning has closed\r\nagainst me!\xe2\x80\x9d She dropped the blind which she had raised to look out,\r\nreturned to her trunk, and took from it the gray wig which was part of\r\nher dramatic costume in the character of the North-country lady. The\r\nwig had been crumpled in packing; she put it on and went to the\r\ntoilet-table to comb it out. \xe2\x80\x9cHis father has warned him against\r\nMagdalen Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, repeating the passage in Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, and laughing bitterly, as she looked at herself in the glass.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether his father has warned him against Miss Garth?\r\nTo-morrow is sooner than I bargained for. No matter: to-morrow shall\r\nshow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe early morning, when Magdalen rose and looked out, was cloudy and\r\novercast. But as time advanced to the breakfast hour the threatening of\r\nrain passed away; and she was free to provide, without hinderance from\r\nthe weather, for the first necessity of the day\xe2\x80\x94the necessity of\r\nsecuring the absence of her traveling companion from the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge was dressed, armed at all points with her collection of\r\ncirculars, and eager to be away by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. At an earlier hour\r\nMagdalen had provided for her being properly taken care of by the\r\nlandlady\xe2\x80\x99s eldest daughter\xe2\x80\x94a quiet, well-conducted girl, whose interest\r\nin the shopping expedition was readily secured by a little present of\r\nmoney for the purchase, on her own account, of a parasol and a muslin\r\ndress. Shortly after ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Magdalen dismissed Mrs. Wragge and her\r\nattendant in a cab. She then joined the landlady\xe2\x80\x94who was occupied in\r\nsetting the rooms in order upstairs\xe2\x80\x94with the object of ascertaining, by\r\na little well-timed gossip, what the daily habits might be of the\r\ninmates of the house.\r\n\r\nShe discovered that there were no other lodgers but Mrs. Wragge and\r\nherself. The landlady\xe2\x80\x99s husband was away all day, employed at a railway\r\nstation. Her second daughter was charged with the care of the kitchen\r\nin the elder sister\xe2\x80\x99s absence. The younger children were at school, and\r\nwould be back at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock to dinner. The landlady herself \xe2\x80\x9cgot up\r\nfine linen for ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d and expected to be occupied over her work all\r\nthat morning in a little room built out at the back of the premises.\r\nThus there was every facility for Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the house in\r\ndisguise, and leaving it unobserved, provided she went out before the\r\nchildren came back to dinner at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nBy eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the apartments were set in order, and the landlady\r\nhad retired to pursue her own employments. Magdalen softly locked the\r\ndoor of her room, drew the blind over the window, and entered at once\r\non her preparations for the perilous experiment of the day.\r\n\r\nThe same quick perception of dangers to be avoided and difficulties to\r\nbe overcome which had warned her to leave the extravagant part of her\r\ncharacter costume in the box at Birmingham now kept her mind fully\r\nalive to the vast difference between a disguise worn by gas-light for\r\nthe amusement of an audience and a disguise assumed by daylight to\r\ndeceive the searching eyes of two strangers. The first article of dress\r\nwhich she put on was an old gown of her own (made of the material\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9calpaca\xe2\x80\x9d), of a dark-brown color, with a neat pattern of little\r\nstar-shaped spots in white. A double flounce running round the bottom\r\nof this dress was the only milliner\xe2\x80\x99s ornament which it presented\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nornament not at all out of character with the costume appropriated to\r\nan elderly lady. The disguise of her head and face was the next object\r\nof her attention. She fitted and arranged the gray wig with the\r\ndexterity which constant practice had given her; fixed the false\r\neyebrows (made rather large, and of hair darker than the wig) carefully\r\nin their position with the gum she had with her for the purpose, and\r\nstained her face with the customary stage materials, so as to change\r\nthe transparent fairness of her complexion to the dull, faintly opaque\r\ncolor of a woman in ill health. The lines and markings of age followed\r\nnext; and here the first obstacles presented themselves. The art which\r\nsucceeded by gas-light failed by day: the difficulty of hiding the\r\nplainly artificial nature of the marks was almost insuperable. She\r\nturned to her trunk; took from it two veils; and putting on her\r\nold-fashioned bonnet, tried the effect of them in succession. One of\r\nthe veils (of black lace) was too thick to be worn over the face at\r\nthat summer season without exciting remark. The other, of plain net,\r\nallowed her features to be seen through it, just indistinctly enough to\r\npermit the safe introduction of certain lines (many fewer than she was\r\naccustomed to use in performing the character) on the forehead and at\r\nthe sides of the mouth. But the obstacle thus set aside only opened the\r\nway to a new difficulty\xe2\x80\x94the difficulty of keeping her veil down while\r\nshe was speaking to other persons, without any obvious reason for doing\r\nso. An instant\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, and a chance look at her little china\r\npalette of stage colors, suggested to her ready invention the\r\nproduction of a visible excuse for wearing her veil. She deliberately\r\ndisfigured herself by artificially reddening the insides of her eyelids\r\nso as to produce an appearance of inflammation which no human creature\r\nbut a doctor\xe2\x80\x94and that doctor at close quarters\xe2\x80\x94could have detected as\r\nfalse. She sprang to her feet and looked triumphantly at the hideous\r\ntransformation of herself reflected in the glass. Who could think it\r\nstrange now if she wore her veil down, and if she begged Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npermission to sit with her back to the light?\r\n\r\nHer last proceeding was to put on the quiet gray cloak which she had\r\nbrought from Birmingham, and which had been padded inside by Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x99s own experienced hands, so as to hide the youthful grace and\r\nbeauty of her back and shoulders. Her costume being now complete, she\r\npracticed the walk which had been originally taught her as appropriate\r\nto the character\xe2\x80\x94a walk with a slight limp\xe2\x80\x94and, returning to the glass\r\nafter a minute\xe2\x80\x99s trial, exercised herself next in the disguise of her\r\nvoice and manner. This was the only part of the character in which it\r\nhad been possible, with her physical peculiarities, to produce an\r\nimitation of Miss Garth; and here the resemblance was perfect. The\r\nharsh voice, the blunt manner, the habit of accompanying certain\r\nphrases by an emphatic nod of the head, the Northumbrian _burr_\r\nexpressing itself in every word which contained the letter \xe2\x80\x9cr\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese personal peculiarities of the old North-country governess were\r\nreproduced to the life. The personal transformation thus completed was\r\nliterally what Captain Wragge had described it to be\xe2\x80\x94a triumph in the\r\nart of self-disguise. Excepting the one case of seeing her face close,\r\nwith a strong light on it, nobody who now looked at Magdalen could have\r\nsuspected for an instant that she was other than an ailing, ill-made,\r\nunattractive woman of fifty years old at least.\r\n\r\nBefore unlocking the door, she looked about her carefully, to make sure\r\nthat none of her stage materials were exposed to view in case the\r\nlandlady entered the room in her absence. The only forgotten object\r\nbelonging to her that she discovered was a little packet of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters which she had been reading overnight, and which had been\r\naccidentally pushed under the looking-glass while she was engaged in\r\ndressing herself. As she took up the letters to put them away, the\r\nthought struck her for the first time, \xe2\x80\x9cWould Norah know me now if we\r\nmet each other in the street?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked in the glass, and smiled\r\nsadly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot even Norah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe unlocked the door, after first looking at her watch. It was close\r\non twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. There was barely an hour left to try her desperate\r\nexperiment, and to return to the lodging before the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s children\r\ncame back from school.\r\n\r\nAn instant\xe2\x80\x99s listening on the landing assured her that all was quiet in\r\nthe passage below. She noiselessly descended the stairs and gained the\r\nstreet without having met any living creature on her way out of the\r\nhouse. In another minute she had crossed the road, and had knocked at\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by the same woman-servant whom she had followed on\r\nthe previous evening to the stationer\xe2\x80\x99s shop. With a momentary tremor,\r\nwhich recalled the memorable first night of her appearance in public,\r\nMagdalen inquired (in Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and with Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s manner)\r\nfor Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lecount has gone out, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Vanstone at home?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, her resolution asserting\r\nitself at once against the first obstacle that opposed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master is not up yet, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother check! A weaker nature would have accepted the warning.\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s nature rose in revolt against it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time will Mrs. Lecount be back?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, if you please, that I will call again as soon after one o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nas possible. I particularly wish to see Mrs. Lecount. My name is Miss\r\nGarth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned and left the house. Going back to her own room was out of\r\nthe question. The servant (as Magdalen knew by not hearing the door\r\nclose) was looking after her; and, moreover, she would expose herself,\r\nif she went indoors, to the risk of going out again exactly at the time\r\nwhen the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s children were sure to be about the house. She\r\nturned mechanically to the right, walked on until she recalled Vauxhall\r\nBridge, and waited there, looking out over the river.\r\n\r\nThe interval of unemployed time now before her was nearly an hour. How\r\nshould she occupy it?\r\n\r\nAs she asked herself the question, the thought which had struck her\r\nwhen she put away the packet of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s letters rose in her mind once\r\nmore. A sudden impulse to test the miserable completeness of her\r\ndisguise mixed with the higher and purer feeling at her heart, and\r\nstrengthened her natural longing to see her sister\xe2\x80\x99s face again, though\r\nshe dare not discover herself and speak. Norah\xe2\x80\x99s later letters had\r\ndescribed, in the fullest details, her life as a governess\xe2\x80\x94her hours\r\nfor teaching, her hours of leisure, her hours for walking out with her\r\npupils. There was just time, if she could find a vehicle at once, for\r\nMagdalen to drive to the house of Norah\xe2\x80\x99s employer, with the chance of\r\ngetting there a few minutes before the hour when her sister would be\r\ngoing out. \xe2\x80\x9cOne look at her will tell me more than a hundred letters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWith that thought in her heart, with the one object of following Norah\r\non her daily walk, under protection of the disguise, Magdalen hastened\r\nover the bridge, and made for the northern bank of the river.\r\n\r\nSo, at the turning-point of her life\xe2\x80\x94so, in the interval before she\r\ntook the irrevocable step, and passed the threshold of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94the forces of Good triumphing in the strife for her over the\r\nforces of Evil, turned her back on the scene of her meditated\r\ndeception, and hurried her mercifully further and further away from the\r\nfatal house.\r\n\r\nShe stopped the first empty cab that passed her; told the driver to go\r\nto New Street, Spring Gardens; and promised to double his fare if he\r\nreached his destination by a given time. The man earned the money\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nthan earned it, as the event proved. Magdalen had not taken ten steps\r\nin advance along New Street, walking toward St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Park, before\r\nthe door of a house beyond her opened, and a lady in mourning came out,\r\naccompanied by two little girls. The lady also took the direction of\r\nthe Park, without turning her head toward Magdalen as she descended the\r\nhouse step. It mattered little; Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s heart looked through her\r\neyes, and told her that she saw Norah.\r\n\r\nShe followed them into St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Park, and thence (along the Mall)\r\ninto the Green Park, venturing closer and closer as they reached the\r\ngrass and ascended the rising ground in the direction of Hyde Park\r\nCorner. Her eager eyes devoured every detail in Norah\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and\r\ndetected the slightest change that had taken place in her figure and\r\nher bearing. She had become thinner since the autumn\xe2\x80\x94her head drooped a\r\nlittle; she walked wearily. Her mourning dress, worn with the modest\r\ngrace and neatness which no misfortune could take from her, was suited\r\nto her altered station; her black gown was made of stuff; her black\r\nshawl and bonnet were of the plainest and cheapest kind. The two little\r\ngirls, walking on either side of her, were dressed in silk. Magdalen\r\ninstinctively hated them.\r\n\r\nShe made a wide circuit on the grass, so as to turn gradually and meet\r\nher sister without exciting suspicion that the meeting was contrived.\r\nHer heart beat fast; a burning heat glowed in her as she thought of her\r\nfalse hair, her false color, her false dress, and saw the dear familiar\r\nface coming nearer and nearer. They passed each other close. Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndark gentle eyes looked up, with a deeper light in them, with a sadder\r\nbeauty than of old\xe2\x80\x94rested, all unconscious of the truth, on her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94and looked away from it again as from the face of a\r\nstranger. That glance of an instant struck Magdalen to the heart. She\r\nstood rooted to the ground after Norah had passed by. A horror of the\r\nvile disguise that concealed her; a yearning to burst its trammels and\r\nhide her shameful painted face on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s bosom, took possession of\r\nher, body and soul. She turned and looked back.\r\n\r\nNorah and the two children had reached the higher ground, and were\r\nclose to one of the gates in the iron railing which fenced the Park\r\nfrom the street. Drawn by an irresistible fascination, Magdalen\r\nfollowed them again, gained on them as they reached the gate, and heard\r\nthe voices of the two children raised in angry dispute which way they\r\nwanted to walk next. She saw Norah take them through the gate, and then\r\nstoop and speak to them, while waiting for an opportunity to cross the\r\nroad. They only grew the louder and the angrier for what she said. The\r\nyoungest\xe2\x80\x94a girl of eight or nine years old\xe2\x80\x94flew into a child\xe2\x80\x99s vehement\r\npassion, cried, screamed, and even kicked at the governess. The people\r\nin the street stopped and laughed; some of them jestingly advised a\r\nlittle wholesome correction; one woman asked Norah if she was the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s mother; another pitied her audibly for being the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoverness. Before Magdalen could push her way through the crowd\xe2\x80\x94before\r\nher all-mastering anxiety to help her sister had blinded her to every\r\nother consideration, and had brought her, self-betrayed, to Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94an open carriage passed the pavement slowly, hindered in its\r\nprogress by the press of vehicles before it. An old lady seated inside\r\nheard the child\xe2\x80\x99s cries, recognized Norah, and called to her\r\nimmediately. The footman parted the crowd, and the children were put\r\ninto the carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky I happened to pass this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nold lady, beckoning contemptuously to Norah to take her place on the\r\nfront seat; \xe2\x80\x9cyou never could manage my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s children, and you\r\nnever will.\xe2\x80\x9d The footman put up the steps, the carriage drove on with\r\nthe children and the governess, the crowd dispersed, and Magdalen was\r\nalone again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cI should only have distressed her.\r\nWe should only have had the misery of parting to suffer again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe mechanically retraced her steps; she returned, as in a dream, to\r\nthe open space of the Park. Arming itself treacherously with the\r\nstrength of her love for her sister, with the vehemence of the\r\nindignation that she felt for her sister\xe2\x80\x99s sake, the terrible\r\ntemptation of her life fastened its hold on her more firmly than ever.\r\nThrough all the paint and disfigurement of the disguise, the fierce\r\ndespair of that strong and passionate nature lowered, haggard and\r\nhorrible. Norah made an object of public curiosity and amusement; Norah\r\nreprimanded in the open street; Norah, the hired victim of an old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s insolence and a child\xe2\x80\x99s ill-temper, and the same man to thank\r\nfor it who had sent Frank to China!\xe2\x80\x94and that man\xe2\x80\x99s son to thank after\r\nhim! The thought of her sister, which had turned her from the scene of\r\nher meditated deception, which had made the consciousness of her own\r\ndisguise hateful to her, was now the thought which sanctioned that\r\nmeans, or any means, to compass her end; the thought which set wings to\r\nher feet, and hurried her back nearer and nearer to the fatal house.\r\n\r\nShe left the Park again, and found herself in the streets without\r\nknowing where. Once more she hailed the first cab that passed her, and\r\ntold the man to drive to Vauxhall Walk.\r\n\r\nThe change from walking to riding quieted her. She felt her attention\r\nreturning to herself and her dress. The necessity of making sure that\r\nno accident had happened to her disguise in the interval since she had\r\nleft her own room impressed itself immediately on her mind. She stopped\r\nthe driver at the first pastry-cook\xe2\x80\x99s shop which he passed, and there\r\nobtained the means of consulting a looking-glass before she ventured\r\nback to Vauxhall Walk.\r\n\r\nHer gray head-dress was disordered, and the old-fashioned bonnet was a\r\nlittle on one side. Nothing else had suffered. She set right the few\r\ndefects in her costume, and returned to the cab. It was half-past one\r\nwhen she approached the house and knocked, for the second time, at Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s door. The woman-servant opened it as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mrs. Lecount come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Step this way, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant preceded Magdalen along an empty passage, and, leading her\r\npast an uncarpeted staircase, opened the door of a room at the back of\r\nthe house. The room was lighted by one window looking out on a yard;\r\nthe walls were bare; the boarded floor was uncovered. Two bedroom\r\nchairs stood against the wall, and a kitchen-table was placed under the\r\nwindow. On the table stood a glass tank filled with water, and\r\nornamented in the middle by a miniature pyramid of rock-work interlaced\r\nwith weeds. Snails clung to the sides of the tank; tadpoles and tiny\r\nfish swam swiftly in the green water, slippery efts and slimy frogs\r\ntwined their noiseless way in and out of the weedy rock-work; and on\r\ntop of the pyramid there sat solitary, cold as the stone, brown as the\r\nstone, motionless as the stone, a little bright-eyed toad. The art of\r\nkeeping fish and reptiles as domestic pets had not at that time been\r\npopularized in England; and Magdalen, on entering the room, started\r\nback, in irrepressible astonishment and disgust, from the first\r\nspecimen of an Aquarium that she had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind her. \xe2\x80\x9cMy pets hurt\r\nnobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen turned, and confronted Mrs. Lecount. She had expected\xe2\x80\x94founding\r\nher anticipations on the letter which the housekeeper had written to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94to see a hard, wily, ill-favored, insolent old woman. She found\r\nherself in the presence of a lady of mild, ingratiating manners, whose\r\ndress was the perfection of neatness, taste, and matronly simplicity,\r\nwhose personal appearance was little less than a triumph of physical\r\nresistance to the deteriorating influence of time. If Mrs. Lecount had\r\nstruck some fifteen or sixteen years off her real age, and had asserted\r\nherself to be eight-and-thirty, there would not have been one man in a\r\nthousand, or one woman in a hundred, who would have hesitated to\r\nbelieve her. Her dark hair was just turning to gray, and no more. It\r\nwas plainly parted under a spotless lace cap, sparingly ornamented with\r\nmourning ribbons. Not a wrinkle appeared on her smooth white forehead,\r\nor her plump white cheeks. Her double chin was dimpled, and her teeth\r\nwere marvels of whiteness and regularity. Her lips might have been\r\ncritically considered as too thin, if they had not been accustomed to\r\nmake the best of their defects by means of a pleading and persuasive\r\nsmile. Her large black eyes might have looked fierce if they had been\r\nset in the face of another woman, they were mild and melting in the\r\nface of Mrs. Lecount; they were tenderly interested in everything she\r\nlooked at\xe2\x80\x94in Magdalen, in the toad on the rock-work, in the back-yard\r\nview from the window; in her own plump fair hands,\xe2\x80\x94which she rubbed\r\nsoftly one over the other while she spoke; in her own pretty cambric\r\nchemisette, which she had a habit of looking at complacently while she\r\nlistened to others. The elegant black gown in which she mourned the\r\nmemory of Michael Vanstone was not a mere dress\xe2\x80\x94it was a well-made\r\ncompliment paid to Death. Her innocent white muslin apron was a little\r\ndomestic poem in itself. Her jet earrings were so modest in their\r\npretensions that a Quaker might have looked at them and committed no\r\nsin. The comely plumpness of her face was matched by the comely\r\nplumpness of her figure; it glided smoothly over the ground; it flowed\r\nin sedate undulations when she walked. There are not many men who could\r\nhave observed Mrs. Lecount entirely from the Platonic point of\r\nview\xe2\x80\x94lads in their teens would have found her irresistible\xe2\x80\x94women only\r\ncould have hardened their hearts against her, and mercilessly forced\r\ntheir way inward through that fair and smiling surface. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst glance at this Venus of the autumn period of female life more\r\nthan satisfied her that she had done well to feel her ground in\r\ndisguise before she ventured on matching herself against Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I the pleasure of addressing the lady who called this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired the housekeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I speaking to Miss Garth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in the expression of her eyes, as she asked that question,\r\nwarned Magdalen to turn her face further inward from the window than\r\nshe had turned it yet. The bare doubt whether the housekeeper might not\r\nhave seen her already under too strong a light shook her\r\nself-possession for the moment. She gave herself time to recover it,\r\nand merely answered by a bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept my excuses, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, for the place in which I am compelled to\r\nreceive you,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mrs. Lecount in fluent English, spoken with a\r\nforeign accent. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanstone is only here for a temporary purpose. We\r\nleave for the sea-side to-morrow afternoon, and it has not been thought\r\nworth while to set the house in proper order. Will you take a seat, and\r\noblige me by mentioning the object of your visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glided imperceptibly a step or two nearer to Magdalen, and placed a\r\nchair for her exactly opposite the light from the window. \xe2\x80\x9cPray sit\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, looking with the tenderest interest at the\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s inflamed eyes through the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s net veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am suffering, as you see, from a complaint in the eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMagdalen, steadily keeping her profile toward the window, and carefully\r\npitching her voice to the tone of Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cI must beg your\r\npermission to wear my veil down, and to sit away from the light.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nsaid those words, feeling mistress of herself again. With perfect\r\ncomposure she drew the chair back into the corner of the room beyond\r\nthe window and seated herself, keeping the shadow of her bonnet well\r\nover her face. Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s persuasive lips murmured a polite\r\nexpression of sympathy; Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s amiable black eyes looked more\r\ninterested in the strange lady than ever. She placed a chair for\r\nherself exactly on a line with Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s, and sat so close to the wall\r\nas to force her visitor either to turn her head a little further round\r\ntoward the window, or to fail in politeness by not looking at the\r\nperson whom she addressed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, with a\r\nconfidential little cough. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to what circumstances am I indebted for\r\nthe honor of this visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire, first, if my name happens to be familiar to you?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMagdalen, turning toward her as a matter of necessity, but coolly\r\nholding up her handkerchief at the same time between her face and the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Lecount, with another little cough, rather harsher\r\nthan the first. \xe2\x80\x9cThe name of Miss Garth is not familiar to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall best explain the object that\r\ncauses me to intrude on you by mentioning who I am. I lived for many\r\nyears as governess in the family of the late Mr. Andrew Vanstone, of\r\nCombe-Raven, and I come here in the interest of his orphan daughters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s hands, which had been smoothly sliding one over the\r\nother up to this time, suddenly stopped; and Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s lips,\r\nself-forgetfully shutting up, owned they were too thin at the very\r\noutset of the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am surprised you can bear the light out-of-doors without a green\r\nshade,\xe2\x80\x9d she quietly remarked; leaving the false Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nannouncement of herself as completely unnoticed as it she had not\r\nspoken at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find a shade over my eyes keeps them too hot at this time of the\r\nyear,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Magdalen, steadily matching the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomposure. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask whether you heard what I said just now on the\r\nsubject of my errand in this house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire on my side, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in what way that errand can possibly\r\nconcern _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI come to you because Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintentions toward the two young ladies were made known to them in the\r\nform of a letter from yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat plain answer had its effect. It warned Mrs. Lecount that the\r\nstrange lady was better informed than she had at first suspected, and\r\nthat it might hardly be wise, under the circumstances, to dismiss her\r\nunheard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper, \xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely understood before;\r\nI perfectly understand now. You are mistaken, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in supposing that\r\nI am of any importance, or that I exercise any influence in this\r\npainful matter. I am the mouth-piece of Mr. Noel Vanstone; the pen he\r\nholds, if you will excuse the expression\xe2\x80\x94nothing more. He is an\r\ninvalid, and like other invalids, he has his bad days and his good. It\r\nwas his bad day when that answer was written to the young person\xe2\x80\x94shall\r\nI call her Miss Vanstone? I will, with pleasure, poor girl; for who am\r\nI to make distinctions, and what is it to me whether her parents were\r\nmarried or not? As I was saying, it was one of Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s bad\r\ndays when that answer was sent, and therefore I had to write it; simply\r\nas his secretary, for want of a better. If you wish to speak on the\r\nsubject of these young ladies\xe2\x80\x94shall I call them young ladies, as you\r\ndid just now? no, poor things, I will call them the Misses Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x94If\r\nyou wish to speak on the subject of these Misses Vanstone, I will\r\nmention your name, and your object in favoring me with this call, to\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone. He is alone in the parlor, and this is one of his\r\ngood days. I have the influence of an old servant over him, and I will\r\nuse that influence with pleasure in your behalf. Shall I go at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Mrs. Lecount, rising, with the friendliest anxiety to make\r\nherself useful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I am not taking any undue\r\nadvantage of your kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are laying me under an\r\nobligation\xe2\x80\x94you are permitting me, in my very limited way, to assist the\r\nperformance of a benevolent action.\xe2\x80\x9d She bowed, smiled, and glided out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nLeft by herself, Magdalen allowed the anger which she had suppressed in\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s presence to break free from her. For want of a nobler\r\nobject to attack, it took the direction of the toad. The sight of the\r\nhideous little reptile sitting placid on his rock throne, with his\r\nbright eyes staring impenetrably into vacancy, irritated every nerve in\r\nher body. She looked at the creature with a shrinking intensity of\r\nhatred; she whispered at it maliciously through her set teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder whose blood runs coldest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyours, you little monster,\r\nor Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s? I wonder which is the slimiest, her heart or your\r\nback? You hateful wretch, do you know what your mistress is? Your\r\nmistress is a devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speckled skin under the toad\xe2\x80\x99s mouth mysteriously wrinkled itself,\r\nthen slowly expanded again, as if he had swallowed the words just\r\naddressed to him. Magdalen started back in disgust from the first\r\nperceptible movement in the creature\xe2\x80\x99s body, trifling as it was, and\r\nreturned to her chair. She had not seated herself again a moment too\r\nsoon. The door opened noiselessly, and Mrs. Lecount appeared once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanstone will see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you will kindly wait a few\r\nminutes. He will ring the parlor bell when his present occupation is at\r\nan end, and he is ready to receive you. Be careful, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, not to\r\ndepress his spirits, nor to agitate him in any way. His heart has been\r\na cause of serious anxiety to those about him, from his earliest years.\r\nThere is no positive disease; there is only a chronic feebleness\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfatty degeneration\xe2\x80\x94a want of vital power in the organ itself. His heart\r\nwill go on well enough if you don\xe2\x80\x99t give his heart too much to do\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis the advice of all the medical men who have seen him. You will not\r\nforget it, and you will keep a guard over your conversation\r\naccordingly. Talking of medical men, have you ever tried the Golden\r\nOintment for that sad affliction in your eyes? It has been described to\r\nme as an excellent remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has not succeeded in my case,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I\r\nsee Mr. Noel Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I inquire\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes your question refer\r\nin any way to those two poor girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt refers to the Misses Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I can\xe2\x80\x99t enter into it. Excuse me, I really can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss these\r\npoor girls (I am so glad to hear you call them the Misses Vanstone!)\r\nexcept in my master\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and by my master\xe2\x80\x99s express permission.\r\nLet us talk of something else while we are waiting here. Will you\r\nnotice my glass Tank? I have every reason to believe that it is a\r\nperfect novelty in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at the tank while you were out of the room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you? You take no interest in the subject, I dare say? Quite\r\nnatural. I took no interest either until I was married. My dear\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x94dead many years since\xe2\x80\x94formed my tastes and elevated me to\r\nhimself. You have heard of the late Professor Lecomte, the eminent\r\nSwiss naturalist? I am his widow. The English circle at Zurich (where I\r\nlived in my late master\xe2\x80\x99s service) Anglicized my name to Lecount. Your\r\ngenerous country people will have nothing foreign about them\xe2\x80\x94not even a\r\nname, if they can help it. But I was speaking of my husband\xe2\x80\x94my dear\r\nhusband, who permitted me to assist him in his pursuits. I have had\r\nonly one interest since his death\xe2\x80\x94an interest in science. Eminent in\r\nmany things, the professor was great at reptiles. He left me his\r\nSubjects and his Tank. I had no other legacy. There is the Tank. All\r\nthe Subjects died but this quiet little fellow\xe2\x80\x94this nice little toad.\r\nAre you surprised at my liking him? There is nothing to be surprised\r\nat. The professor lived long enough to elevate me above the common\r\nprejudice against the reptile creation. Properly understood, the\r\nreptile creation is beautiful. Properly dissected, the reptile creation\r\nis instructive in the last degree.\xe2\x80\x9d She stretched out her little\r\nfinger, and gently stroked the toad\xe2\x80\x99s back with the tip of it. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nrefreshing to the touch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso nice and cool this\r\nsummer weather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell from the parlor rang. Mrs. Lecount rose, bent fondly over the\r\nAquarium, and chirruped to the toad at parting as if it had been a\r\nbird. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanstone is ready to receive you. Follow me, if you please,\r\nMiss Garth.\xe2\x80\x9d With these words she opened the door, and led the way out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Garth, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, opening the parlor door, and\r\nannouncing the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s appearance with the tone and manner of a\r\nwell-bred servant.\r\n\r\nMagdalen found herself in a long, narrow room, consisting of a back\r\nparlor and a front parlor, which had been thrown into one by opening\r\nthe folding-doors between them. Seated not far from the front window,\r\nwith his back to the light, she saw a frail, flaxen-haired,\r\nself-satisfied little man, clothed in a fair white dressing-gown many\r\nsizes too large for him, with a nosegay of violets drawn neatly through\r\nthe button-hole over his breast. He looked from thirty to\r\nfive-and-thirty years old. His complexion was as delicate as a young\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s, his eyes were of the lightest blue, his upper lip was adorned\r\nby a weak little white mustache, waxed and twisted at either end into a\r\nthin spiral curl. When any object specially attracted his attention he\r\nhalf closed his eyelids to look at it. When he smiled, the skin at his\r\ntemples crumpled itself up into a nest of wicked little wrinkles. He\r\nhad a plate of strawberries on his lap, with a napkin under them to\r\npreserve the purity of his white dressing-gown. At his right hand stood\r\na large round table, covered with a collection of foreign curiosities,\r\nwhich seemed to have been brought together from the four quarters of\r\nthe globe. Stuffed birds from Africa, porcelain monsters from China,\r\nsilver ornaments and utensils from India and Peru, mosaic work from\r\nItaly, and bronzes from France, were all heaped together pell-mell with\r\nthe coarse deal boxes and dingy leather cases which served to pack them\r\nfor traveling. The little man apologized, with a cheerful and simpering\r\nconceit, for his litter of curiosities, his dressing-gown, and his\r\ndelicate health; and, waving his hand toward a chair, placed his\r\nattention, with pragmatical politeness, at the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s disposal.\r\nMagdalen looked at him with a momentary doubt whether Mrs. Lecount had\r\nnot deceived her. Was this the man who mercilessly followed the path on\r\nwhich his merciless father had walked before him? She could hardly\r\nbelieve it. \xe2\x80\x9cTake a seat, Miss Garth,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, observing her\r\nhesitation, and announcing his own name in a high, thin,\r\nfretfully-consequential voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI am Mr. Noel Vanstone. You wished to\r\nsee me\xe2\x80\x94here I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be permitted to retire, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d replied her master. \xe2\x80\x9cStay here, Lecount, and keep us\r\ncompany. Mrs. Lecount has my fullest confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\naddressing Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you say to me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you say to her.\r\nShe is a domestic treasure. There is not another house in England has\r\nsuch a treasure as Mrs. Lecount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper listened to the praise of her domestic virtues with\r\neyes immovably fixed on her elegant chemisette. But Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s quick\r\npenetration had previously detected a look that passed between Mrs.\r\nLecount and her master, which suggested that Noel Vanstone had been\r\ninstructed beforehand what to say and do in his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s presence. The\r\nsuspicion of this, and the obstacles which the room presented to\r\narranging her position in it so as to keep her face from the light,\r\nwarned Magdalen to be on her guard.\r\n\r\nShe had taken her chair at first nearly midway in the room. An\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x99s after-reflection induced her to move her seat toward the left\r\nhand, so as to place herself just inside, and close against, the left\r\npost of the folding-door. In this position she dexterously barred the\r\nonly passage by which Mrs. Lecount could have skirted round the large\r\ntable and contrived to front Magdalen by taking a chair at her master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside. On the right hand of the table the empty space was well occupied\r\nby the fireplace and fender, by some traveling-trunks, and a large\r\npacking-case. There was no alternative left for Mrs. Lecount but to\r\nplace herself on a line with Magdalen against the opposite post of the\r\nfolding-door, or to push rudely past the visitor with the obvious\r\nintention of getting in front of her. With an expressive little cough,\r\nand with one steady look at her master, the housekeeper conceded the\r\npoint, and took her seat against the right-hand door-post. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a\r\nlittle,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Lecount; \xe2\x80\x9cmy turn next!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind what you are about, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, as Magdalen\r\naccidentally approached the table in moving her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cMind the sleeve\r\nof your cloak! Excuse me, you nearly knocked down that silver\r\ncandlestick. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s a common candlestick. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nof the sort\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a Peruvian candlestick. There are only three of that\r\npattern in the world. One is in the possession of the President of\r\nPeru; one is locked up in the Vatican; and one is on My table. It cost\r\nten pounds; it\xe2\x80\x99s worth fifty. One of my father\xe2\x80\x99s bargains, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. All\r\nthese things are my father\xe2\x80\x99s bargains. There is not another house in\r\nEngland which has such curiosities as these. Sit down, Lecount; I beg\r\nyou will make yourself comfortable. Mrs. Lecount is like the\r\ncuriosities, Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x94she is one of my father\xe2\x80\x99s bargains. You are one\r\nof my father\xe2\x80\x99s bargains, are you not, Lecount? My father was a\r\nremarkable man, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. You will be reminded of him here at every turn.\r\nI have got his dressing-gown on at this moment. No such linen as this\r\nis made now\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t get it for love or money. Would you like to feel\r\nthe texture? Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re no judge of texture? Perhaps you would\r\nprefer talking to me about these two pupils of yours? They are two, are\r\nthey not? Are they fine girls? Plump, fresh, full-blown English\r\nbeauties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Lecount, sorrowfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI must really\r\nbeg permission to retire if you speak of the poor things in that way. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t sit by, sir, and hear them turned into ridicule. Consider their\r\nposition; consider Miss Garth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou good creature!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, surveying the housekeeper\r\nthrough his half-closed eyelids. \xe2\x80\x9cYou excellent Lecount! I assure you,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, Mrs. Lecount is a worthy creature. You will observe that she\r\npities the two girls. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as that myself, but I can make\r\nallowances for them. I am a large-minded man. I can make allowances for\r\nthem and for you.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled with the most cordial politeness, and\r\nhelped himself to a strawberry from the dish on his lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shock Miss Garth; indeed, sir, without meaning it, you shock Miss\r\nGarth,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is not accustomed to you as I\r\nam. Consider Miss Garth, sir. As a favor to _me_, consider Miss Garth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus far Magdalen had resolutely kept silence. The burning anger, which\r\nwould have betrayed her in an instant if she had let it flash its way\r\nto the surface, throbbed fast and fiercely at her heart, and warned\r\nher, while Noel Vanstone was speaking, to close her lips. She would\r\nhave allowed him to talk on uninterruptedly for some minutes more if\r\nMrs. Lecount had not interfered for the second time. The refined\r\ninsolence of the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s pity was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s insolence; and it\r\nstung her into instantly controlling herself. She had never more\r\nadmirably imitated Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s voice and manner than when she spoke\r\nher next words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cI make no claim to be\r\ntreated with any extraordinary consideration. I am a governess, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t expect it. I have only one favor to ask. I beg Mr. Noel Vanstone,\r\nfor his own sake, to hear what I have to say to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that Miss\r\nGarth has some serious warning to give you. She says you are to hear\r\nher, for your own sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s fair complexion suddenly turned white. He put away\r\nthe plate of strawberries among his father\xe2\x80\x99s bargains. His hand shook\r\nand his little figure twisted itself uneasily in the chair. Magdalen\r\nobserved him attentively. \xe2\x80\x9cOne discovery already,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought; \xe2\x80\x9che is\r\na coward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noel Vanstone, with visible\r\ntrepidation of look and manner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by telling me I must\r\nlisten to you for my own sake? If you come her to intimidate me, you\r\ncome to the wrong man. My strength of character was universally noticed\r\nin our circle at Zurich\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUniversally, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cBut let us hear Miss Garth.\r\nPerhaps I have misinterpreted her meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have exactly expressed my\r\nmeaning. My object in coming here is to warn Mr. Noel Vanstone against\r\nthe course which he is now taking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you want to help these poor\r\ngirls, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk in that way! Soften his resolution, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, by\r\nentreaties; don\xe2\x80\x99t strengthen it by threats!\xe2\x80\x9d She a little overstrained\r\nthe tone of humility in which she spoke those words\xe2\x80\x94a little overacted\r\nthe look of apprehension which accompanied them. If Magdalen had not\r\nseen plainly enough already that it was Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s habitual\r\npractice to decide everything for her master in the first instance, and\r\nthen to persuade him that he was not acting under his housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution but under his own, she would have seen it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear what Lecount has just said?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhear the unsolicited testimony of a person who has known me from\r\nchildhood? Take care, Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x94take care!\xe2\x80\x9d He complacently arranged\r\nthe tails of his white dressing-gown over his knees and took the plate\r\nof strawberries back on his lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to offend you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only anxious to\r\nopen your eyes to the truth. You are not acquainted with the characters\r\nof the two sisters whose fortunes have fallen into your possession. I\r\nhave known them from childhood; and I come to give you the benefit of\r\nmy experience in their interests and in yours. You have nothing to\r\ndread from the elder of the two; she patiently accepts the hard lot\r\nwhich you, and your father before you, have forced on her. The younger\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is the very opposite of this. She has already declined\r\nto submit to your father\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and she now refuses to be silenced\r\nby Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Take my word for it, she is capable of giving\r\nyou serious trouble if you persist in making an enemy of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone changed color once more, and began to fidget again in his\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cSerious trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with a blank look. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean\r\nwriting letters, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, she has given trouble enough already. She has\r\nwritten once to me, and twice to my father. One of the letters to my\r\nfather was a threatening letter\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe expressed her feelings, poor child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nit hard to send her back her letter, but your dear father knew best.\r\nWhat I said at the time was, Why not let her express her feelings? What\r\nare a few threatening words, after all? In her position, poor creature,\r\nthey are words, and nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise you not to be too sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI know her\r\nbetter than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused at those words\xe2\x80\x94paused in a momentary terror. The sting of\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s pity had nearly irritated her into forgetting her\r\nassumed character, and speaking in her own voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have referred to the letters written by my pupil,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed,\r\naddressing Noel Vanstone as soon as she felt sure of herself again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nwill say nothing about what she has written to your father; we will\r\nonly speak of what she has written to you. Is there anything unbecoming\r\nin her letter, anything said in it that is false? Is it not true that\r\nthese two sisters have been cruelly deprived of the provision which\r\ntheir father made for them? His will to this day speaks for him and for\r\nthem; and it only speaks to no purpose, because he was not aware that\r\nhis marriage obliged him to make it again, and because he died before\r\nhe could remedy the error. Can you deny that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone smiled, and helped himself to a strawberry. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nattempt to deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Miss Garth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not true,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the law which has taken the\r\nmoney from these sisters, whose father made no second will, has now\r\ngiven that very money to you, whose father made no will at all? Surely,\r\nexplain it how you may, this is hard on those orphan girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery hard,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes you in that light,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount shook her head, and closed her handsome black eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarrowing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI can characterize it, Miss Garth, by no other\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94harrowing. How the young person\xe2\x80\x94no! how Miss Vanstone, the\r\nyounger\xe2\x80\x94discovered that my late respected master made no will I am at a\r\nloss to understand. Perhaps it was put in the papers? But I am\r\ninterrupting you, Miss Garth. Do have something more to say about your\r\npupil\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x9d She noiselessly drew her chair forward, as she said\r\nthese words, a few inches beyond the line of the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s chair. The\r\nattempt was neatly made, but it proved useless. Magdalen only kept her\r\nhead more to the left, and the packing-case on the floor prevented Mrs.\r\nLecount from advancing any further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only one more question to put,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cMy pupil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter addressed a proposal to Mr. Noel Vanstone. I beg him to inform\r\nme why he has refused to consider it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good lady!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, arching his white eyebrows in\r\nsatirical astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you really in earnest? Do you know what\r\nthe proposal is? Have you seen the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite in earnest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have seen the letter. It\r\nentreats you to remember how Mr. Andrew Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s fortune has come\r\ninto your hands; it informs you that one-half of that fortune, divided\r\nbetween his daughters, was what his will intended them to have; and it\r\nasks of your sense of justice to do for his children what he would have\r\ndone for them himself if he had lived. In plainer words still, it asks\r\nyou to give one-half of the money to the daughters, and it leaves you\r\nfree to keep the other half yourself. That is the proposal. Why have\r\nyou refused to consider it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the simplest possible reason, Miss Garth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, in\r\nhigh good-humor. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to remind you of a well-known proverb: A\r\nfool and his money are soon parted. Whatever else I may be, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it in that way, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\nserious\xe2\x80\x94pray be serious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite impossible, Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined her master. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be serious.\r\nMy poor father, Miss Garth, took a high moral point of view in this\r\nmatter. Lecount, there, takes a high moral point of view\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nLecount? I do nothing of the sort. I have lived too long in the\r\nContinental atmosphere to trouble myself about moral points of view. My\r\ncourse in this business is as plain as two and two make four. I have\r\ngot the money, and I should be a born idiot if I parted with it. There\r\nis my point of view! Simple enough, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand on my\r\ndignity; I don\xe2\x80\x99t meet you with the law, which is all on my side; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t blame your coming here, as a total stranger, to try and alter my\r\nresolution; I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame the two girls for wanting to dip their\r\nfingers into my purse. All I say is, I am not fool enough to open it.\r\n_Pas si bete_, as we used to say in the English circle at Zurich. You\r\nunderstand French, Miss Garth? _Pas si bete!_\xe2\x80\x9d He set aside his plate\r\nof strawberries once more, and daintily dried his fingers on his fine\r\nwhite napkin.\r\n\r\nMagdalen kept her temper. If she could have struck him dead by lifting\r\nher hand at that moment, it is probable she would have lifted it. But\r\nshe kept her temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the last words you have to say\r\nin this matter are the words said for you in Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s letter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have inherited your own father\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, as well as the fortune\r\nof Mr. Andrew Vanstone, and yet you feel no obligation to act from\r\nmotives of justice or generosity toward these two sisters? All you\r\nthink it necessary to say to them is, you have got the money, and you\r\nrefuse to part with a single farthing of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost accurately stated! Miss Garth, you are a woman of business.\r\nLecount, Miss Garth is a woman of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t appeal to me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Lecount, gracefully wringing her\r\nplump white hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it! I must interfere! Let me\r\nsuggest\xe2\x80\x94oh, what do you call it in English?\xe2\x80\x94a compromise. Dear Mr.\r\nNoel, you are perversely refusing to do yourself justice; you have\r\nbetter reasons than the reason you have given to Miss Garth. You follow\r\nyour honored father\xe2\x80\x99s example; you feel it due to his memory to act in\r\nthis matter as he acted before you. That is his reason, Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 I\r\nimplore you on my knees to take that as his reason. He will do what his\r\ndear father did; no more, no less. His dear father made a proposal, and\r\nhe himself will now make that proposal over again. Yes, Mr. Noel, you\r\nwill remember what this poor girl says in her letter to you. Her sister\r\nhas been obliged to go out as a governess; and she herself, in losing\r\nher fortune, has lost the hope of her marriage for years and years to\r\ncome. You will remember this\xe2\x80\x94and you will give the hundred pounds to\r\none, and the hundred pounds to the other, which your admirable father\r\noffered in the past time? If he does this, Miss Garth, will he do\r\nenough? If he gives a hundred pounds each to these unfortunate\r\nsisters\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will repent the insult to the last hour of his life,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMagdalen.\r\n\r\nThe instant that answer passed her lips she would have given worlds to\r\nrecall it. Mrs. Lecount had planted her sting in the right place at\r\nlast. Those rash words of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s had burst from her passionately,\r\nin her own voice.\r\n\r\nNothing but the habit of public performance saved her from making the\r\nserious error that she had committed more palpable still, by attempting\r\nto set it right. Here her past practice in the Entertainment came to\r\nher rescue, and urged her to go on instantly in Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s voice as\r\nif nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean well, Mrs. Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are doing harm\r\ninstead of good. My pupils will accept no such compromise as you\r\npropose. I am sorry to have spoken violently just now; I beg you will\r\nexcuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked hard for information in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nwhile she spoke those conciliatory words. Mrs. Lecount baffled the look\r\nby putting her handkerchief to her eyes. Had she, or had she not,\r\nnoticed the momentary change in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s voice from the tones that\r\nwere assumed to the tones that were natural? Impossible to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat more can I do!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Lecount behind her handkerchief.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me time to think\xe2\x80\x94give me time to recover myself. May I retire,\r\nsir, for a moment? My nerves are shaken by this sad scene. I must have\r\na glass of water, or I think I shall faint. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go yet, Miss Garth. I\r\nbeg you will give us time to set this sad matter right, if we can\xe2\x80\x94I beg\r\nyou will remain until I come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were two doors of entrance to the room. One, the door into the\r\nfront parlor, close at Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s left hand. The other, the door into\r\nthe back parlor, situated behind her. Mrs. Lecount politely\r\nretired\xe2\x80\x94through the open folding-doors\xe2\x80\x94by this latter means of exit, so\r\nas not to disturb the visitor by passing in front of her. Magdalen\r\nwaited until she heard the door open and close again behind her, and\r\nthen resolved to make the most of the opportunity which left her alone\r\nwith Noel Vanstone. The utter hopelessness of rousing a generous\r\nimpulse in that base nature had now been proved by her own experience.\r\nThe last chance left was to treat him like the craven creature he was,\r\nand to influence him through his fears.\r\n\r\nBefore she could speak, Noel Vanstone himself broke the silence.\r\nCunningly as he strove to hide it, he was half angry, half alarmed at\r\nhis housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s desertion of him. He looked doubtingly at his\r\nvisitor; he showed a nervous anxiety to conciliate her until Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray remember, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I never denied that this case was a hard one,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe began. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said just now you had no wish to offend me\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to offend you. May I offer you some strawberries? Would\r\nyou like to look at my father\xe2\x80\x99s bargains? I assure you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I am\r\nnaturally a gallant man; and I feel for both these sisters\xe2\x80\x94especially\r\nthe younger one. Touch me on the subject of the tender passion, and you\r\ntouch me on a weak place. Nothing would please me more than to hear\r\nthat Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s lover (I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I always call her Miss Vanstone,\r\nand so does Lecount)\xe2\x80\x94I say, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, nothing would please me more than to\r\nhear that Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s lover had come back and married her. If a\r\nloan of money would be likely to bring him back, and if the security\r\noffered was good, and if my lawyer thought me justified\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Mr. Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are entirely mistaken in your\r\nestimate of the person you have to deal with. You are seriously wrong\r\nin supposing that the marriage of the younger sister\xe2\x80\x94if she could be\r\nmarried in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time\xe2\x80\x94would make any difference in the convictions\r\nwhich induced her to write to your father and to you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that\r\nshe may act from a mixture of motives. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that she clings to\r\nthe hope of hastening her marriage, and to the hope of rescuing her\r\nsister from a life of dependence. But if both those objects were\r\naccomplished by other means, nothing would induce her to leave you in\r\npossession of the inheritance which her father meant his children to\r\nhave. I know her, Mr. Vanstone! She is a nameless, homeless, friendless\r\nwretch. The law which takes care of you, the law which takes care of\r\nall legitimate children, casts her like carrion to the winds. It is\r\nyour law\xe2\x80\x94not hers. She only knows it as the instrument of a vile\r\noppression, an insufferable wrong. The sense of that wrong haunts her\r\nlike a possession of the devil. The resolution to right that wrong\r\nburns in her like fire. If that miserable girl was married and rich,\r\nwith millions tomorrow, do you think she would move an inch from her\r\npurpose? I tell you she would resist, to the last breath in her body,\r\nthe vile injustice which has struck at the helpless children, through\r\nthe calamity of their father\xe2\x80\x99s death! I tell you she would shrink from\r\nno means which a desperate woman can employ to force that closed hand\r\nof yours open, or die in the attempt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly. Once more her own indomitable earnestness had\r\nbetrayed her. Once more the inborn nobility of that perverted nature\r\nhad risen superior to the deception which it had stooped to practice.\r\nThe scheme of the moment vanished from her mind\xe2\x80\x99s view; and the\r\nresolution of her life burst its way outward in her own words, in her\r\nown tones, pouring hotly and more hotly from her heart. She saw the\r\nabject manikin before her cowering, silent, in his chair. Had his fears\r\nleft him sense enough to perceive the change in her voice? No: _his_\r\nface spoke the truth\xe2\x80\x94his fears had bewildered him. This time the chance\r\nof the moment had befriended her. The door behind her chair had not\r\nopened again yet. \xe2\x80\x9cNo ears but his have heard me,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, with a\r\nsense of unutterable relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI have escaped Mrs. Lecount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had done nothing of the kind. Mrs. Lecount had never left the room.\r\n\r\nAfter opening the door and closing it again, without going out, the\r\nhousekeeper had noiselessly knelt down behind Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\nSteadying herself against the post of the folding-door, she took a pair\r\nof scissors from her pocket, waited until Noel Vanstone (from whose\r\nview she was entirely hidden) had attracted Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s attention by\r\nspeaking to her, and then bent forward, with the scissors ready in her\r\nhand. The skirt of the false Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s gown\xe2\x80\x94the brown alpaca dress,\r\nwith the white spots on it\xe2\x80\x94touched the floor, within the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreach. Mrs. Lecount lifted the outer of the two flounces which ran\r\nround the bottom of the dress one over the other, softly cut away a\r\nlittle irregular fragment of stuff from the inner flounce, and neatly\r\nsmoothed the outer one over it again, so as to hide the gap. By the\r\ntime she had put the scissors back in her pocket, and had risen to her\r\nfeet (sheltering herself behind the post of the folding-door), Magdalen\r\nhad spoken her last words. Mrs. Lecount quietly repeated the ceremony\r\nof opening and shutting the back parlor door; and returned to her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened, sir, in my absence?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, addressing her\r\nmaster with a look of alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are pale; you are agitated! Oh, Miss\r\nGarth, have you forgotten the caution I gave you in the other room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Garth has forgotten everything,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, recovering\r\nhis lost composure on the re-appearance of Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Garth\r\nhas threatened me in the most outrageous manner. I forbid you to pity\r\neither of those two girls any more, Lecount\xe2\x80\x94especially the younger one.\r\nShe is the most desperate wretch I ever heard of! If she can\xe2\x80\x99t get my\r\nmoney by fair means, she threatens to have it by foul. Miss Garth has\r\ntold me that to my face. To my face!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, folding his arms,\r\nand looking mortally insulted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompose yourself, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cPray compose yourself, and\r\nleave me to speak to Miss Garth. I regret to hear, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that you have\r\nforgotten what I said to you in the next room. You have agitated Mr.\r\nNoel; you have compromised the interests you came here to plead; and\r\nyou have only repeated what we knew before. The language you have\r\nallowed yourself to use in my absence is the same language which your\r\npupil was foolish enough to employ when she wrote for the second time\r\nto my late master. How can a lady of your years and experience\r\nseriously repeat such nonsense? This girl boasts and threatens. She\r\nwill do this; she will do that. You have her confidence, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Tell\r\nme, if you please, in plain words, what can she do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSharply as the taunt was pointed, it glanced off harmless. Mrs. Lecount\r\nhad planted her sting once too often. Magdalen rose in complete\r\npossession of her assumed character and composedly terminated the\r\ninterview. Ignorant as she was of what had happened behind her chair,\r\nshe saw a change in Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s look and manner which warned her to\r\nrun no more risks, and to trust herself no longer in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in my pupil\xe2\x80\x99s confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHer own acts will\r\nanswer your question when the time comes. I can only tell you, from my\r\nown knowledge of her, that she is no boaster. What she wrote to Mr.\r\nMichael Vanstone was what she was prepared to do\xe2\x80\x94-what, I have reason\r\nto think, she was actually on the point of doing, when her plans were\r\noverthrown by his death. Mr. Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s son has only to persist\r\nin following his father\xe2\x80\x99s course to find, before long, that I am not\r\nmistaken in my pupil, and that I have not come here to intimidate him\r\nby empty threats. My errand is done. I leave Mr. Noel Vanstone with two\r\nalternatives to choose from. I leave him to share Mr. Andrew Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfortune with Mr. Andrew Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters\xe2\x80\x94or to persist in his\r\npresent refusal and face the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d She bowed, and walked to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone started to his feet, with anger and alarm struggling\r\nwhich should express itself first in his blank white face. Before he\r\ncould open his lips, Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s plump hands descended on his\r\nshoulders, put him softly back in his chair, and restored the plate of\r\nstrawberries to its former position on his lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRefresh yourself, Mr. Noel, with a few more strawberries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand leave Miss Garth to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed Magdalen into the passage, and closed the door of the room\r\nafter her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you residing in London, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI reside in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I want to write to you, where can I address my letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the post-office, Birmingham,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, mentioning the place\r\nwhich she had last left, and at which all letters were still addressed\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount repeated the direction to fix it in her memory, advanced\r\ntwo steps in the passage, and quietly laid her right hand on Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA word of advice, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cone word at parting. You are a\r\nbold woman and a clever woman. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too bold; don\xe2\x80\x99t be too clever.\r\nYou are risking more than you think for.\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly raised herself\r\non tiptoe and whispered the next words in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s ear. \xe2\x80\x9c_I hold you\r\nin the hollow of my hand!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, with a fierce hissing\r\nemphasis on every syllable. Her left hand clinched itself stealthily as\r\nshe spoke. It was the hand in which she had concealed the fragment of\r\nstuff from Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s gown\xe2\x80\x94the hand which held it fast at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, pushing her back.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount glided away politely to open the house door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean nothing now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cwait a little, and time may show. One\r\nlast question, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, before I bid you good-by. When your pupil was a\r\nlittle innocent child, did she ever amuse herself by building a house\r\nof cards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen impatiently answered by a gesture in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see her build up the house higher and higher,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded\r\nMrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9ctill it was quite a pagoda of cards? Did you ever see\r\nher open her little child\xe2\x80\x99s eyes wide and look at it, and feel so proud\r\nof what she had done already that she wanted to do more? Did you ever\r\nsee her steady her pretty little hand, and hold her innocent breath,\r\nand put one other card on the top, and lay the whole house, the instant\r\nafterward, a heap of ruins on the table? Ah, you have seen that. Give\r\nher, if you please, a friendly message from me. I venture to say she\r\nhas built the house high enough already; and I recommend her to be\r\ncareful before she puts on that other card.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe shall have your message,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, with Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbluntness, and Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s emphatic nod of the head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I doubt her\r\nminding it. Her hand is rather steadier than you suppose, and I think\r\nshe will put on the other card.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd bring the house down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd build it up again,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, opening the door. \xe2\x80\x9cOne last word,\r\nMiss Garth. Do think of what I said in the back room! Do try the Golden\r\nOintment for that sad affliction in your eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Magdalen crossed the threshold of the door she was met by the\r\npostman ascending the house steps with a letter picked out from the\r\nbundle in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cNoel Vanstone, Esquire?\xe2\x80\x9d she heard the man say,\r\ninterrogatively, as she made her way down the front garden to the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nShe passed through the garden gates little thinking from what new\r\ndifficulty and new danger her timely departure had saved her. The\r\nletter which the postman had just delivered into the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands was no other than the anonymous letter addressed to Noel Vanstone\r\nby Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount returned to the parlor, with the fragment of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress in one hand, and with Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s letter in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got rid of her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you shut the door\r\nat last on Miss Garth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call her Miss Garth, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, smiling\r\ncontemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is as much Miss Garth as you are. We have been\r\nfavored by the performance of a clever masquerade; and if we had taken\r\nthe disguise off our visitor, I think we should have found under it\r\nMiss Vanstone herself.\xe2\x80\x94Here is a letter for you, sir, which the postman\r\nhas just left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put the letter on the table within her master\xe2\x80\x99s reach. Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s amazement at the discovery just communicated to him kept his\r\nwhole attention concentrated on the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s face. He never so\r\nmuch as looked at the letter when she placed it before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my word for it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mrs. Lecount, composedly taking a\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen our visitor gets home she will put her gray hair away in a\r\nbox, and will cure that sad affliction in her eyes with warm water and\r\na sponge. If she had painted the marks on her face, as well as she\r\npainted the inflammation in her eyes, the light would have shown me\r\nnothing, and I should certainly have been deceived. But I saw the\r\nmarks; I saw a young woman\xe2\x80\x99s skin under that dirty complexion of hers;\r\nI heard in this room a true voice in a passion, as well as a false\r\nvoice talking with an accent, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in one morsel of that\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s personal appearance from top to toe. The girl herself, in my\r\nopinion, Mr. Noel\xe2\x80\x94and a bold girl too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you lock the door and send for the police?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Noel.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father would have sent for the police. You know, as well as I do,\r\nLecount, my father would have sent for the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cI think your father would have\r\nwaited until he had got something more for the police to do than we\r\nhave got for them yet. We shall see this lady again, sir. Perhaps she\r\nwill come here next time with her own face and her own voice. I am\r\ncurious to see what her own face is like. I am curious to know whether\r\nwhat I have heard of her voice in a passion is enough to make me\r\nrecognize her voice when she is calm. I possess a little memorial of\r\nher visit of which she is not aware, and she will not escape me so\r\neasily as she thinks. If it turns out a useful memorial, you shall know\r\nwhat it is. If not, I will abstain from troubling you on so trifling a\r\nsubject.\xe2\x80\x94Allow me to remind you, sir, of the letter under your hand.\r\nYou have not looked at it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone opened the letter. He started as his eye fell on the\r\nfirst lines\xe2\x80\x94hesitated\xe2\x80\x94and then hurriedly read it through. The paper\r\ndropped from his hand, and he sank back in his chair. Mrs. Lecount\r\nsprang to her feet with the alacrity of a young woman and picked up the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. Her face altered as she put the\r\nquestion, and her large black eyes hardened fiercely, in genuine\r\nastonishment and alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend for the police,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her master. \xe2\x80\x9cLecount, I insist on\r\nbeing protected. Send for the police!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I read the letter, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe feebly waved his hand. Mrs. Lecount read the letter attentively, and\r\nput it aside on the table, without a word, when she had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you nothing to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noel Vanstone, staring at his\r\nhousekeeper in blank dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cLecount, I\xe2\x80\x99m to be robbed! The scoundrel\r\nwho wrote that letter knows all about it, and won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me anything\r\nunless I pay him. I\xe2\x80\x99m to be robbed! Here\xe2\x80\x99s property on this table worth\r\nthousands of pounds\xe2\x80\x94property that can never be replaced\xe2\x80\x94property that\r\nall the crowned heads in Europe could not produce if they tried. Lock\r\nme in, Lecount, and send for the police!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of sending for the police, Mrs. Lecount took a large green\r\npaper fan from the chimney-piece, and seated herself opposite her\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are agitated, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are heated. Let me cool\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith her face as hard as ever\xe2\x80\x94with less tenderness of look and manner\r\nthan most women would have shown if they had been rescuing a\r\nhalf-drowned fly from a milk-jug\xe2\x80\x94she silently and patiently fanned him\r\nfor five minutes or more. No practiced eye observing the peculiar\r\nbluish pallor of his complexion, and the marked difficulty with which\r\nhe drew his breath, could have failed to perceive that the great organ\r\nof life was in this man, what the housekeeper had stated it to be, too\r\nweak for the function which it was called on to perform. The heart\r\nlabored over its work as if it had been the heart of a worn-out old\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you relieved, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you think a little?\r\nCan you exercise your better judgment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose and put her hand over his heart with as much mechanical\r\nattention and as little genuine interest as if she had been feeling the\r\nplates at dinner to ascertain if they had been properly warmed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe went on, seating herself again, and resuming the exercise of the\r\nfan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are getting better already, Mr. Noel.\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me about this\r\nanonymous letter until you have thought for yourself, and have given\r\nyour own opinion first.\xe2\x80\x9d She went on with the fanning, and looked him\r\nhard in the face all the time. \xe2\x80\x9cThink,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthink, sir, without\r\ntroubling yourself to express your thoughts. Trust to my intimate\r\nsympathy with you to read them. Yes, Mr. Noel, this letter is a paltry\r\nattempt to frighten you. What does it say? It says you are the object\r\nof a conspiracy directed by Miss Vanstone. We know that already\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlady of the inflamed eyes has told us. We snap our fingers at the\r\nconspiracy. What does the letter say next? It says the writer has\r\nvaluable information to give you if you will pay for it. What did you\r\ncall this person yourself just now, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called him a scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, recovering his\r\nself-importance, and raising himself gradually in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you in that, sir, as I agree in everything else,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nproceeded Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a scoundrel who really has this\r\ninformation and who means what he says, or he is a mouthpiece of Miss\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s, and she has caused this letter to be written for the\r\npurpose of puzzling us by another form of disguise. Whether the letter\r\nis true, or whether the letter is false\xe2\x80\x94am I not reading your own wiser\r\nthoughts now, Mr. Noel?\xe2\x80\x94you know better than to put your enemies on\r\ntheir guard by employing the police in this matter too soon. I quite\r\nagree with you\xe2\x80\x94no police just yet. You will allow this anonymous man,\r\nor anonymous woman, to suppose you are easily frightened; you will lay\r\na trap for the information in return for the trap laid for your money;\r\nyou will answer the letter, and see what comes of the answer; and you\r\nwill only pay the expense of employing the police when you know the\r\nexpense is necessary. I agree with you again\xe2\x80\x94no expense, if we can help\r\nit. In every particular, Mr. Noel, my mind and your mind in this matter\r\nare one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes you in that light, Lecount\xe2\x80\x94does it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink so myself; I certainly think so. I won\xe2\x80\x99t pay the police a\r\nfarthing if I can possibly help it.\xe2\x80\x9d He took up the letter again, and\r\nbecame fretfully perplexed over a second reading of it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the man\r\nwants money!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to forget, Lecount,\r\nthat the man wants money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney which you offer him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Lecount; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94as your\r\nthoughts have already anticipated\xe2\x80\x94money which you don\xe2\x80\x99t give him. No!\r\nno! you say to this man: \xe2\x80\x98Hold out your hand, sir;\xe2\x80\x99 and when he has\r\nheld it, you give him a smack for his pains, and put your own hand back\r\nin your pocket.\xe2\x80\x94I am so glad to see you laughing, Mr. Noel! so glad to\r\nsee you getting back your good spirits. We will answer the letter by\r\nadvertisement, as the writer directs\xe2\x80\x94advertisement is so cheap! Your\r\npoor hand is trembling a little\xe2\x80\x94shall I hold the pen for you? I am not\r\nfit to do more; but I can always promise to hold the pen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for his reply she went into the back parlor, and\r\nreturned with pen, ink, and paper. Arranging a blotting-book on her\r\nknees, and looking a model of cheerful submission, she placed herself\r\nonce more in front of her master\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I write from your dictation, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cOr shall I\r\nmake a little sketch, and will you correct it afterward? I will make a\r\nlittle sketch. Let me see the letter. We are to advertise in the\r\n_Times_, and we are to address \xe2\x80\x98An Unknown Friend.\xe2\x80\x99 What shall I say,\r\nMr. Noel? Stay; I will write it, and then you can see for yourself: \xe2\x80\x98An\r\nUnknown Friend is requested to mention (by advertisement) an address at\r\nwhich a letter can reach him. The receipt of the information which he\r\noffers will be acknowledged by a reward of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 What sum of money do you\r\nwish me to set down, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet down nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, with a sudden outbreak of\r\nimpatience. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney matters are my business\xe2\x80\x94I say money matters are my\r\nbusiness, Lecount. Leave it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Lecount, handing her master the\r\nblotting-book. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not forget to be liberal in offering money\r\nwhen you know beforehand you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to part with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t dictate, Lecount! I won\xe2\x80\x99t submit to dictation!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel\r\nVanstone, asserting his own independence more and more impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmean to conduct this business for myself. I am master, Lecount!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are master, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was master before me. And I am my father\xe2\x80\x99s son. I tell you,\r\nLecount, I am my father\xe2\x80\x99s son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount bowed submissively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to set down any sum of money I think right,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Noel\r\nVanstone, nodding his little flaxen head vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to send\r\nthis advertisement myself. The servant shall take it to the stationer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto be put into the _Times_. When I ring the bell twice, send the\r\nservant. You understand, Lecount? Send the servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount bowed again and walked slowly to the door. She knew to a\r\nnicety when to lead her master and when to let him go alone. Experience\r\nhad taught her to govern him in all essential points by giving way to\r\nhim afterward on all points of minor detail. It was a characteristic of\r\nhis weak nature\xe2\x80\x94as it is of all weak natures\xe2\x80\x94to assert itself\r\nobstinately on trifles. The filling in of the blank in the\r\nadvertisement was the trifle in this case; and Mrs. Lecount quieted her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions that she was leading him by instantly conceding it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mule has kicked,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself, in her own language, as\r\nshe opened the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI can do no more with him to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLecount!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her master, as she stepped into the passage. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not offended with me, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noel Vanstone, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cAs you said just now\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nare master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood creature! Give me your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d He kissed her hand, and smiled in\r\nhigh approval of his own affectionate proceeding. \xe2\x80\x9cLecount, you are a\r\nworthy creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. She courtesied and went out. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nhe had any brains in that monkey head of his,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself in\r\nthe passage, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a rascal he would be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Noel Vanstone became absorbed in anxious reflection\r\nover the blank space in the advertisement. Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s apparently\r\nsuperfluous hint to him to be liberal in offering money when he knew he\r\nhad no intention of parting with it, had been founded on an intimate\r\nknowledge of his character. He had inherited his father\xe2\x80\x99s sordid love\r\nof money, without inheriting his father\xe2\x80\x99s hard-headed capacity for\r\nseeing the uses to which money can be put. His one idea in connection\r\nwith his wealth was the idea of keeping it. He was such an inborn miser\r\nthat the bare prospect of being liberal in theory only daunted him. He\r\ntook up the pen; laid it down again; and read the anonymous letter for\r\nthe third time, shaking his head over it suspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I offer this\r\nman a large sum of money,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, on a sudden, \xe2\x80\x9chow do I know he\r\nmay not find a means of actually making me pay it? Women are always in\r\na hurry. Lecount is always in a hurry. I have got the afternoon before\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the afternoon to consider it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fretfully put away the blotting-book and the sketch of the\r\nadvertisement on the chair which Mrs. Lecount had just left. As he\r\nreturned to his own seat, he shook his little head solemnly, and\r\narranged his white dressing-gown over his knees with the air of a man\r\nabsorbed in anxious thought. Minute after minute passed away; the\r\nquarters and the half-hours succeeded each other on the dial of Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s watch, and still Noel Vanstone remained lost in doubt; still\r\nno summons for the servants disturbed the tranquillity of the parlor\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after parting with Mrs. Lecount, Magdalen had cautiously\r\nabstained from crossing the road to her lodgings, and had only ventured\r\nto return after making a circuit in the neighborhood. When she found\r\nherself once more in Vauxhall Walk, the first object which attracted\r\nher attention was a cab drawn up before the door of the lodgings. A few\r\nsteps more in advance showed her the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter standing at\r\nthe cab door engaged in a dispute with the driver on the subject of his\r\nfare. Noticing that the girl\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned toward her, Magdalen\r\ninstantly profited by that circumstance and slipped unobserved into the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nShe glided along the passage, ascended the stairs, and found herself,\r\non the first landing, face to face with her traveling companion! There\r\nstood Mrs. Wragge, with a pile of small parcels hugged up in her arms,\r\nanxiously waiting the issue of the dispute with the cabman in the\r\nstreet. To return was impossible\xe2\x80\x94the sound of the angry voices below\r\nwas advancing into the passage. To hesitate was worse than useless. But\r\none choice was left\xe2\x80\x94the choice of going on\xe2\x80\x94and Magdalen desperately\r\ntook it. She pushed by Mrs. Wragge without a word, ran into her own\r\nroom, tore off her cloak, bonnet and wig, and threw them down out of\r\nsight in the blank space between the sofa-bedstead and the wall.\r\n\r\nFor the first few moments, astonishment bereft Mrs. Wragge of the power\r\nof speech, and rooted her to the spot where she stood. Two out of the\r\ncollection of parcels in her arms fell from them on the stairs. The\r\nsight of that catastrophe roused her. \xe2\x80\x9cThieves!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge,\r\nsuddenly struck by an idea. \xe2\x80\x9cThieves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen heard her through the room door, which she had not had time to\r\nclose completely. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Mrs. Wragge?\xe2\x80\x9d she called out in her own\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d She snatched up a towel while she spoke,\r\ndipped it in water, and passed it rapidly over the lower part of her\r\nface. At the sound of the familiar voice Mrs. Wragge turned\r\nround\xe2\x80\x94dropped a third parcel\xe2\x80\x94and, forgetting it in her astonishment,\r\nascended the second flight of stairs. Magdalen stepped out on the\r\nfirst-floor landing, with the towel held over her forehead as if she\r\nwas suffering from headache. Her false eyebrows required time for their\r\nremoval, and a headache assumed for the occasion suggested the most\r\nconvenient pretext she could devise for hiding them as they were hidden\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you disturbing the house for?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cPray be quiet; I\r\nam half blind with the headache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything wrong, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the landlady from the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend is timid; and the\r\ndispute with the cabman has frightened her. Pay the man what he wants,\r\nand let him go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is She?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Wragge, in a tremulous whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nwoman who scuttled by me into your room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cNo woman scuttled by you\xe2\x80\x94as you call it. Look\r\nin and see for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw open the door. Mrs. Wragge walked into the room\xe2\x80\x94looked all\r\nover it\xe2\x80\x94saw nobody\xe2\x80\x94and indicated her astonishment at the result by\r\ndropping a fourth parcel, and trembling helplessly from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her go in here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, in awestruck accents. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nwoman in a gray cloak and a poke bonnet. A rude woman. She scuttled by\r\nme on the stairs\xe2\x80\x94she did. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the room, and no woman in it. Give us\r\na Prayer-book!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge, turning deadly pale, and letting her\r\nwhole remaining collection of parcels fall about her in a little\r\ncascade of commodities. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to read something Good. I want to think\r\nof my latter end. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a Ghost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re dreaming; the shopping has been too\r\nmuch for you. Go into your own room and take your bonnet off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard tell of ghosts in night-gowns, ghosts in sheets, and ghosts\r\nin chains,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mrs. Wragge, standing petrified in her own magic\r\ncircle of linen-drapers\xe2\x80\x99 parcels. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a worse ghost than any of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94a ghost in a gray cloak and a poke bonnet. I know what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Mrs. Wragge, melting into penitent tears. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a judgment on\r\nme for being so happy away from the captain. It\xe2\x80\x99s a judgment on me for\r\nhaving been down at heel in half the shops in London, first with one\r\nshoe and then with the other, all the time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out. I\xe2\x80\x99m a sinful\r\ncreature. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let go of me\xe2\x80\x94whatever you do, my dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t let go of\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d She caught Magdalen fast by the arm and fell into another\r\ntrembling fit at the bare idea of being left by herself.\r\n\r\nThe one remaining chance in such an emergency as this was to submit to\r\ncircumstances. Magdalen took Mrs. Wragge to a chair; having first\r\nplaced it in such a position as might enable her to turn her back on\r\nher traveling-companion, while she removed the false eyebrows by the\r\nhelp of a little water. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand try if\r\nyou can compose yourself while I bathe my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompose myself?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to compose myself\r\nwhen my head feels off my shoulders? The worst Buzzing I ever had with\r\nthe Cookery-book was nothing to the Buzzing I\xe2\x80\x99ve got now with the\r\nGhost. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a miserable end to a holiday! You may take me back again,\r\nmy dear, whenever you like\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of it already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving at last succeeded in removing the eyebrows, Magdalen was free to\r\ncombat the unfortunate impression produced on her companion\xe2\x80\x99s mind by\r\nevery weapon of persuasion which her ingenuity could employ.\r\n\r\nThe attempt proved useless. Mrs. Wragge persisted\xe2\x80\x94on evidence which, it\r\nmay be remarked in parenthesis, would have satisfied many wiser\r\nghost-seers than herself\xe2\x80\x94in believing that she had been supernaturally\r\nfavored by a visitor from the world of spirits. All that Magdalen could\r\ndo was to ascertain, by cautious investigation, that Mrs. Wragge had\r\nnot been quick enough to identify the supposed ghost with the character\r\nof the old North-country lady in the Entertainment. Having satisfied\r\nherself on this point, she had no resource but to leave the rest to the\r\nnatural incapability of retaining impressions\xe2\x80\x94unless those impressions\r\nwere perpetually renewed\xe2\x80\x94which was one of the characteristic\r\ninfirmities of her companion\xe2\x80\x99s weak mind. After fortifying Mrs. Wragge\r\nby reiterated assurances that one appearance (according to all the laws\r\nand regulations of ghosts) meant nothing unless it was immediately\r\nfollowed by two more\xe2\x80\x94after patiently leading back her attention to the\r\nparcels dropped on the floor and on the stairs\xe2\x80\x94and after promising to\r\nkeep the door of communication ajar between the two rooms if Mrs.\r\nWragge would engage on her side to retire to her own chamber, and to\r\nsay no more on the terrible subject of the ghost\xe2\x80\x94Magdalen at last\r\nsecured the privilege of reflecting uninterruptedly on the events of\r\nthat memorable day.\r\n\r\nTwo serious consequences had followed her first step forward. Mrs.\r\nLecount had entrapped her into speaking in her own voice, and accident\r\nhad confronted her with Mrs. Wragge in disguise.\r\n\r\nWhat advantage had she gained to set against these disasters? The\r\nadvantage of knowing more of Noel Vanstone and of Mrs. Lecount than she\r\nmight have discovered in months if she had trusted to inquiries made\r\nfor her by others. One uncertainty which had hitherto perplexed her was\r\nset at rest already. The scheme she had privately devised against\r\nMichael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94which Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s sharp insight had partially\r\npenetrated when she first warned him that their partnership must be\r\ndissolved\xe2\x80\x94was a scheme which she could now plainly see must be\r\nabandoned as hopeless, in the case of Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s son. The\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s habits of speculation had been the pivot on which the whole\r\nmachinery of her meditated conspiracy had been constructed to turn. No\r\nsuch vantage-ground was discoverable in the doubly sordid character of\r\nthe son. Noel Vanstone was invulnerable on the very point which had\r\npresented itself in his father as open to attack.\r\n\r\nHaving reached this conclusion, how was she to shape her future course?\r\nWhat new means could she discover which would lead her secretly to her\r\nend, in defiance of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s malicious vigilance and Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s miserly distrust?\r\n\r\nShe was seated before the looking-glass, mechanically combing out her\r\nhair, while that all-important consideration occupied her mind. The\r\nagitation of the moment had raised a feverish color in her cheeks, and\r\nhad brightened the light in her large gray eyes. She was conscious of\r\nlooking her best; conscious how her beauty gained by contrast, after\r\nthe removal of the disguise. Her lovely light brown hair looked thicker\r\nand softer than ever, now that it had escaped from its imprisonment\r\nunder the gray wig. She twisted it this way and that, with quick,\r\ndexterous fingers; she laid it in masses on her shoulders; she threw it\r\nback from them in a heap and turned sidewise to see how it fell\xe2\x80\x94to see\r\nher back and shoulders freed from the artificial deformities of the\r\npadded cloak. After a moment she faced the looking-glass once more;\r\nplunged both hands deep in her hair; and, resting her elbows on the\r\ntable, looked closer and closer at the reflection of herself, until her\r\nbreath began to dim the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cI can twist any man alive round my\r\nfinger,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, with a smile of superb triumph, \xe2\x80\x9cas long as I\r\nkeep my looks! If that contemptible wretch saw me now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She shrank from\r\nfollowing that thought to its end, with a sudden horror of herself: she\r\ndrew back from the glass, shuddering, and put her hands over her face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for you, what a wretch I might be!\xe2\x80\x9d Her\r\neager fingers snatched the little white silk bag from its hiding-place\r\nin her bosom; her lips devoured it with silent kisses. \xe2\x80\x9cMy darling! my\r\nangel! Oh, Frank, how I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d The tears gushed into her eyes. She\r\npassionately dried them, restored the bag to its place, and turned her\r\nback on the looking-glass. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought; \xe2\x80\x9cno more\r\nof my mad, miserable self for to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShrinking from all further contemplation of her next step in\r\nadvance\xe2\x80\x94shrinking from the fast-darkening future, with which Noel\r\nVanstone was now associated in her inmost thoughts\xe2\x80\x94she looked\r\nimpatiently about the room for some homely occupation which might take\r\nher out of herself. The disguise which she had flung down between the\r\nwall and the bed recurred to her memory. It was impossible to leave it\r\nthere. Mrs. Wragge (now occupied in sorting her parcels) might weary of\r\nher employment, might come in again at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, might pass\r\nnear the bed, and see the gray cloak. What was to be done?\r\n\r\nHer first thought was to put the disguise back in her trunk. But after\r\nwhat had happened, there was danger in trusting it so near to herself\r\nwhile she and Mrs. Wragge were together under the same roof. She\r\nresolved to be rid of it that evening, and boldly determined on sending\r\nit back to Birmingham. Her bonnet-box fitted into her trunk. She took\r\nthe box out, thrust in the wig and cloak, and remorselessly flattened\r\ndown the bonnet at the top. The gown (which she had not yet taken off)\r\nwas her own; Mrs. Wragge had been accustomed to see her in it\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nno need to send the gown back. Before closing the box, she hastily\r\ntraced these lines on a sheet of paper: \xe2\x80\x9cI took the inclosed things\r\naway by mistake. Please keep them for me, with the rest of my luggage\r\nin your possession, until you hear from me again.\xe2\x80\x9d Putting the paper on\r\nthe top of the bonnet, she directed the box to Captain Wragge at\r\nBirmingham, took it downstairs immediately, and sent the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter away with it to the nearest Receiving-house. \xe2\x80\x9cThat difficulty\r\nis disposed of,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, as she went back to her own room again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge was still occupied in sorting her parcels on her narrow\r\nlittle bed. She turned round with a faint scream when Magdalen looked\r\nin at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was the ghost again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntrying to take warning, my dear, by what\xe2\x80\x99s happened to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve put all\r\nmy parcels straight, just as the captain would like to see \xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99m up\r\nat heel with both shoes. If I close my eyes to-night\xe2\x80\x94which I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I shall\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep as straight as my legs will let me. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never have another holiday as long as I live. I hope I shall be\r\nforgiven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, mournfully shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI humbly\r\nhope I shall be forgiven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgiven!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cIf other women wanted as little\r\nforgiving as you do\xe2\x80\x94Well! well! Suppose you open some of these parcels.\r\nCome! I want to see what you have been buying to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge hesitated, sighed penitently, considered a little,\r\nstretched out her hand timidly toward one of the parcels, thought of\r\nthe supernatural warning, and shrank back from her own purchases with a\r\ndesperate exertion of self-control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen this one.\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, to encourage her: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s faded blue eyes began to brighten dimly, in spite of her\r\nremorse; but she self-denyingly shook her head. The master-passion of\r\nshopping might claim his own again\xe2\x80\x94but the ghost was not laid yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you get it at a bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, confidentially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirt cheap!\xe2\x80\x9d cried poor Mrs. Wragge, falling headlong into the snare,\r\nand darting at the parcel as eagerly as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nMagdalen kept her gossiping over her purchases for an hour or more, and\r\nthen wisely determined to distract her attention from all ghostly\r\nrecollections in another way by taking her out for a walk.\r\n\r\nAs they left the lodgings, the door of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s house opened,\r\nand the woman-servant appeared, bent on another errand. She was\r\napparently charged with a letter on this occasion which she carried\r\ncarefully in her hand. Conscious of having formed no plan yet either\r\nfor attack or defense, Magdalen wondered, with a momentary dread,\r\nwhether Mrs. Lecount had decided already on opening fresh\r\ncommunications, and whether the letter was directed to \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Garth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter bore no such address. Noel Vanstone had solved his pecuniary\r\nproblem at last. The blank space in the advertisement was filled up,\r\nand Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s anonymous warning\r\nwas now on its way to insertion in the _Times_.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE THIRD SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\r\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nExtract from the Advertising Columns of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn unknown friend is requested to mention (by advertisement) an\r\naddress at which a letter can reach him. The receipt of the information\r\nwhich he offers will be acknowledged by a reward of Five Pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nII.\r\nFrom Captain Wragge to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBirmingham, July 2d, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR GIRL,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe box containing the articles of costumes which you took away by\r\nmistake has come safely to hand. Consider it under my special\r\nprotection until I hear from you again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI embrace this opportunity to assure you once more of my unalterable\r\nfidelity to your interests. Without attempting to intrude myself into\r\nyour confidence, may I inquire whether Mr. Noel Vanstone has consented\r\nto do you justice? I greatly fear he has declined\xe2\x80\x94in which case I can\r\nlay my hand on my heart, and solemnly declare that his meanness revolts\r\nme. Why do I feel a foreboding that you have appealed to him in vain?\r\nWhy do I find myself viewing this fellow in the light of a noxious\r\ninsect? We are total strangers to each other; I have no sort of\r\nknowledge of him, except the knowledge I picked up in making your\r\ninquiries. Has my intense sympathy with your interests made my\r\nperceptions prophetic? or, to put it fancifully, is there really such a\r\nthing as a former state of existence? and has Mr. Noel Vanstone\r\nmortally insulted me\xe2\x80\x94say, in some other planet?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write, my dear Magdalen, as you see, with my customary dash of\r\nhumor. But I am serious in placing my services at your disposal. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet the question of terms cause you an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. I accept\r\nbeforehand any terms you like to mention. If your present plans point\r\nthat way, I am ready to squeeze Mr. Noel Vanstone, in your interests,\r\ntill the gold oozes out of him at every pore. Pardon the coarseness of\r\nthis metaphor. My anxiety to be of service to you rushes into words;\r\nlays my meaning, in the rough, at your feet; and leaves your taste to\r\npolish it with the choicest ornaments of the English language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is my unfortunate wife? I am afraid you find it quite impossible\r\nto keep her up at heel, or to mold her personal appearance into harmony\r\nwith the eternal laws of symmetry and order. Does she attempt to be too\r\nfamiliar with you? I have always been accustomed to check her, in this\r\nrespect. She has never been permitted to call me anything but Captain;\r\nand on the rare occasions since our union, when circumstances may have\r\nobliged her to address me by letter, her opening form of salutation has\r\nbeen rigidly restricted to \xe2\x80\x98Dear Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Accept these trifling domestic\r\nparticulars as suggesting hints which may be useful to you in managing\r\nMrs. Wragge; and believe me, in anxious expectation of hearing from you\r\nagain,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevotedly yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHORATIO WRAGGE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nFrom Norah to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n_Forwarded, with the Two Letters that follow it, from the Post Office,\r\nBirmingham._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWestmoreland House, Kensington,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAREST MAGDALEN,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you write next (and pray write soon!) address your letter to me\r\nat Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s. I have left my situation; and some little time may\r\nelapse before I find another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it is all over I may acknowledge to you, my darling, that I was\r\nnot happy. I tried hard to win the affection of the two little girls I\r\nhad to teach; but they seemed, I am sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell why, to dislike\r\nme from the first. Their mother I have no reason to complain of. But\r\ntheir grandmother, who was really the ruling power in the house, made\r\nmy life very hard to me. My inexperience in teaching was a constant\r\nsubject of remark with her; and my difficulties with the children were\r\nalways visited on me as if they had been entirely of my own making. I\r\ntell you this, so that you may not suppose I regret having left my\r\nsituation. Far from it, my love\xe2\x80\x94I am glad to be out of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have saved a little money, Magdalen; and I should so like to spend\r\nit in staying a few days with you. My heart aches for a sight of my\r\nsister; my ears are weary for the sound of her voice. A word from you\r\ntelling me where we can meet, is all I want. Think of it\xe2\x80\x94pray think of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I am discouraged by this first check. There are many\r\nkind people in the world; and some of them may employ me next time. The\r\nway to happiness is often very hard to find; harder, I almost think,\r\nfor women than for men. But if we only try patiently, and try long\r\nenough, we reach it at last\xe2\x80\x94in heaven, if not on earth. I think _my_\r\nway now is the way which leads to seeing you again. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that,\r\nmy love, the next time you think of\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNORAH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nFrom Miss Garth to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWestmoreland House, July 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MAGDALEN,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no useless remonstrances to apprehend at the sight of my\r\nhandwriting. My only object in this letter is to tell you something\r\nwhich I know your sister will not tell you of her own accord. She is\r\nentirely ignorant that I am writing to you. Keep her in ignorance, if\r\nyou wish to spare her unnecessary anxiety, and me unnecessary distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah\xe2\x80\x99s letter, no doubt, tells you that she has left her situation. I\r\nfeel it my painful duty to add that she has left it on your account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter occurred in this manner. Messrs. Wyatt, Pendril, and Gwilt\r\nare the solicitors of the gentleman in whose family Norah was employed.\r\nThe life which you have chosen for yourself was known as long ago as\r\nDecember last to all the partners. You were discovered performing in\r\npublic at Derby by the person who had been employed to trace you at\r\nYork; and that discovery was communicated by Mr. Wyatt to Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nemployer a few days since, in reply to direct inquiries about you on\r\nthat gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s part. His wife and his mother (who lives with him) had\r\nexpressly desired that he would make those inquiries; their doubts\r\nhaving been aroused by Norah\xe2\x80\x99s evasive answers when they questioned her\r\nabout her sister. You know Norah too well to blame her for this.\r\nEvasion was the only escape your present life had left her, from\r\ntelling a downright falsehood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat same day, the two ladies of the family, the elder and the\r\nyounger, sent for your sister, and told her they had discovered that\r\nyou were a public performer, roaming from place to place in the country\r\nunder an assumed name. They were just enough not to blame Norah for\r\nthis; they were just enough to acknowledge that her conduct had been as\r\nirreproachable as I had guaranteed it should be when I got her the\r\nsituation. But, at the same time, they made it a positive condition of\r\nher continuing in their employment that she should never permit you to\r\nvisit her at their house, or to meet her and walk out with her when she\r\nwas in attendance on the children. Your sister\xe2\x80\x94who has patiently borne\r\nall hardships that fell on herself\xe2\x80\x94instantly resented the slur cast on\r\n_you_. She gave her employers warning on the spot. High words followed,\r\nand she left the house that evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to distress you by representing the loss of this\r\nsituation in the light of a disaster. Norah was not so happy in it as I\r\nhad hoped and believed she would be. It was impossible for me to know\r\nbeforehand that the children were sullen and intractable, or that the\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s mother was accustomed to make her domineering disposition\r\nfelt by every one in the house. I will readily admit that Norah is well\r\nout of this situation. But the harm does not stop here. For all you and\r\nI know to the contrary, the harm may go on. What has happened in this\r\nsituation may happen in another. Your way of life, however pure your\r\nconduct may be\xe2\x80\x94and I will do you the justice to believe it pure\xe2\x80\x94is a\r\nsuspicious way of life to all respectable people. I have lived long\r\nenough in this world to know that the sense of Propriety, in nine\r\nEnglishwomen out of ten, makes no allowances and feels no pity. Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnext employers may discover you; and Norah may throw up a situation\r\nnext time which we may never be able to find for her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave you to consider this. My child, don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am hard on you.\r\nI am jealous for your sister\xe2\x80\x99s tranquillity. If you will forget the\r\npast, Magdalen, and come back, trust to your old governess to forget it\r\ntoo, and to give you the home which your father and mother once gave\r\nher. Your friend, my dear, always,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHARRIET GARTH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nFrom Francis Clare, Jun., to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShanghai, China,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApril 23d, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MAGDALEN,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have deferred answering your letter, in consequence of the\r\ndistracted state of my mind, which made me unfit to write to you. I am\r\nstill unfit, but I feel I ought to delay no longer. My sense of honor\r\nfortifies me, and I undergo the pain of writing this letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy prospects in China are all at an end. The Firm to which I was\r\nbrutally consigned, as if I was a bale of merchandise, has worn out my\r\npatience by a series of petty insults; and I have felt compelled, from\r\nmotives of self-respect, to withdraw my services, which were\r\nundervalued from the first. My returning to England under these\r\ncircumstances is out of the question. I have been too cruelly used in\r\nmy own country to wish to go back to it, even if I could. I propose\r\nembarking on board a private trading-vessel in these seas in a\r\nmercantile capacity, to make my way, if I can, for myself. How it will\r\nend, or what will happen to me next, is more than I can say. It matters\r\nlittle what becomes of me. I am a wanderer and an exile, entirely\r\nthrough the fault of others. The unfeeling desire at home to get rid of\r\nme has accomplished its object. I am got rid of for good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one more sacrifice left for me to make\xe2\x80\x94the sacrifice of\r\nmy heart\xe2\x80\x99s dearest feelings. With no prospects before me, with no\r\nchance of coming home, what hope can I feel of performing my engagement\r\nto yourself? None! A more selfish man than I am might hold you to that\r\nengagement; a less considerate man than I am might keep you waiting for\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94and to no purpose after all. Cruelly as they have been trampled\r\non, my feelings are too sensitive to allow me to do this. I write it\r\nwith the tears in my eyes\xe2\x80\x94you shall not link your fate to an outcast.\r\nAccept these heart-broken lines as releasing you from your promise. Our\r\nengagement is at an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one consolation which supports me in bidding you farewell is, that\r\nneither of us is to blame. You may have acted weakly, under my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence, but I am sure you acted for the best. Nobody knew what the\r\nfatal consequences of driving me out of England would be but myself\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nI was not listened to. I yielded to my father, I yielded to you; and\r\nthis is the end of it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am suffering too acutely to write more. May you never know what my\r\nwithdrawal from our engagement has cost me! I beg you will not blame\r\nyourself. It is not your fault that I have had all my energies\r\nmisdirected by others\xe2\x80\x94it is not your fault that I have never had a fair\r\nchance of getting on in life. Forget the deserted wretch who breathes\r\nhis heartfelt prayers for your happiness, and who will ever remain your\r\nfriend and well-wisher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFRANCIS CLARE, Jun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nFrom Francis Clare, Sen., to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n_Enclosing the preceding Letter._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always told your poor father my son was a Fool, but I never knew he\r\nwas a Scoundrel until the mail came in from China. I have every reason\r\nto believe that he has left his employers under the most disgraceful\r\ncircumstances. Forget him from this time forth, as I do. When you and I\r\nlast set eyes on each other, you behaved well to me in this business.\r\nAll I can now say in return, I do say. My girl, I am sorry for you,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cF.

I recovered her with great difficulty from one of the most\r\nobstinate fainting-fits I ever remember to have met with. Since that\r\ntime she has had no relapse, but there is apparently some heavy\r\ndistress weighing on her mind which it has hitherto been found\r\nimpossible to remove. She sits, as I am informed, perfectly silent, and\r\nperfectly unconscious of what goes on about her, for hours together,\r\nwith a letter in her hand which she will allow nobody to take from her.\r\nIf this state of depression continues, very distressing mental\r\nconsequences may follow; and I only do my duty in suggesting that some\r\nrelative or friend should interfere who has influence enough to rouse\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour obedient servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRICHARD JARVIS, M.R.C.S.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nFrom Norah to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 5th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, write me one line to say if you are still at\r\nBirmingham, and where I can find you there! I have just heard from old\r\nMr. Clare. Oh, Magdalen, if you have no pity on yourself, have some\r\npity on me! The thought of you alone among strangers, the thought of\r\nyou heart-broken under this dreadful blow, never leaves me for an\r\ninstant. No words can tell how I feel for you! My own love, remember\r\nthe better days at home before that cowardly villain stole his way into\r\nyour heart; remember the happy time at Combe-Raven when we were always\r\ntogether. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t treat me like a stranger! We are alone in\r\nthe world now\xe2\x80\x94let me come and comfort you, let me be more than a sister\r\nto you, if I can. One line\xe2\x80\x94only one line to tell me where I can find\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nFrom Magdalen to Norah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 7th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAREST NORAH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that your love for me can wish your letter has done. You, and you\r\nalone, have found your way to my heart. I could think again, I could\r\nfeel again, after reading what you have written to me. Let this\r\nassurance quiet your anxieties. My mind lives and breathes once more\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas dead until I got your letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shock I have suffered has left a strange quietness in me. I feel\r\nas if I had parted from my former self\xe2\x80\x94as if the hopes once so dear to\r\nme had all gone back to some past time from which I am now far removed.\r\nI can look at the wreck of my life more calmly, Norah, than you could\r\nlook at it if we were both together again. I can trust myself already\r\nto write to Frank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, I think no woman ever knows how utterly she has given\r\nherself up to the man she loves\xe2\x80\x94until that man has ill-treated her. Can\r\nyou pity my weakness if I confess to having felt a pang at my heart\r\nwhen I read that part of your letter which calls Frank a coward and a\r\nvillain? Nobody can despise me for this as I despise myself. I am like\r\na dog who crawls back and licks the master\xe2\x80\x99s hand that has beaten him.\r\nBut it is so\xe2\x80\x94I would confess it to nobody but you\xe2\x80\x94indeed, indeed it is\r\nso. He has deceived and deserted me; he has written me a cruel farewell\r\n\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t call him a villain! If he repented and came back to me, I\r\nwould die rather than marry him now\xe2\x80\x94but it grates on me to see that\r\nword coward written against him in your hand! If he is weak of purpose,\r\nwho tried his weakness beyond what it could bear? Do you think this\r\nwould have happened if Michael Vanstone had not robbed us of our own,\r\nand forced Frank away from me to China? In a week from to-day the year\r\nof waiting would have come to an end, and I should have been Frank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, if my marriage portion had not been taken from me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will say, after what has happened, it is well that I have escaped.\r\nMy love! there is something perverse in my heart which answers, No!\r\nBetter have been Frank\xe2\x80\x99s wretched wife than the free woman I am now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not written to him. He sends me no address at which I could\r\nwrite, even if I would. But I have not the wish. I will wait before I\r\nsend him _my_ farewell. If a day ever comes when I have the fortune\r\nwhich my father once promised I should bring to him, do you know what I\r\nwould do with it? I would send it all to Frank, as my revenge on him\r\nfor his letter; as the last farewell word on my side to the man who has\r\ndeserted me. Let me live for that day! Let me live, Norah, in the hope\r\nof better times for _you_, which is all the hope I have left. When I\r\nthink of your hard life, I can almost feel the tears once more in my\r\nweary eyes. I can almost think I have come back again to my former\r\nself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not think me hard-hearted and ungrateful if I say that we\r\nmust wait a little yet before we meet. I want to be more fit to see you\r\nthan I am now. I want to put Frank further away from me, and to bring\r\nyou nearer still. Are these good reasons? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me for\r\nreasons. Take the kiss I have put for you here, where the little circle\r\nis drawn on the paper; and let that bring us together for the present\r\ntill I write again. Good-by, my love. My heart is true to you, Norah,\r\nbut I dare not see you yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAGDALEN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nX. From Magdalen to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been long in answering your letter; but you know what has\r\nhappened, and you will forgive me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that I have to say may be said in a few words. You may depend on\r\nmy never making the general Sense of Propriety my enemy again: I am\r\ngetting knowledge enough of the world to make it my accomplice next\r\ntime. Norah will never leave another situation on my account\xe2\x80\x94my life as\r\na public performer is at an end. It was harmless enough, God knows\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmay live, and so may you, to mourn the day when I parted from it\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nshall never return to it again. It has left me, as Frank has left me,\r\nas all my better thoughts have left me except my thoughts of Norah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of myself! Shall I tell you some news to brighten this dull\r\nletter? Mr. Michael Vanstone is dead, and Mr. Noel Vanstone has\r\nsucceeded to the possession of my fortune and Norah\xe2\x80\x99s. He is quite\r\nworthy of his inheritance. In his father\xe2\x80\x99s place, he would have ruined\r\nus as his father did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more to say that you would care to know. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be distressed\r\nabout me. I am trying to recover my spirits\xe2\x80\x94I am trying to forget the\r\npoor deluded girl who was foolish enough to be fond of Frank in the old\r\ndays at Combe-Raven. Sometimes a pang comes which tells me the girl\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten\xe2\x80\x94but not often.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very kind of you, when you wrote to such a lost creature as I\r\nam, to sign yourself\xe2\x80\x94_always my friend._ \xe2\x80\x98Always\xe2\x80\x99 is a bold word, my\r\ndear old governess! I wonder whether you will ever want to recall it?\r\nIt will make no difference if you do, in the gratitude I shall always\r\nfeel for the trouble you took with me when I was a little girl. I have\r\nill repaid that trouble\xe2\x80\x94ill repaid your kindness to me in after life. I\r\nask your pardon and your pity. The best thing you can do for both of us\r\nis to forget me. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAGDALEN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.\xe2\x80\x94I open the envelope to add one line. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t show\r\nthis letter to Norah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nFrom Magdalen to Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVauxhall Walk, July 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am not mistaken, it was arranged that I should write to you at\r\nBirmingham as soon as I felt myself composed enough to think of the\r\nfuture. My mind is settled at last, and I am now able to accept the\r\nservices which you have so unreservedly offered to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you will forgive the manner in which I received you on your\r\narrival in this house, after hearing the news of my sudden illness. I\r\nwas quite incapable of controlling myself\xe2\x80\x94I was suffering an agony of\r\nmind which for the time deprived me of my senses. It is only your due\r\nthat I should now thank you for treating me with great forbearance at a\r\ntime when forbearance was mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will mention what I wish you to do as plainly and briefly as I can.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, I request you to dispose (as privately as\r\npossible) of every article of costume used in the dramatic\r\nEntertainment. I have done with our performances forever; and I wish to\r\nbe set free from everything which might accidentally connect me with\r\nthem in the future. The key of my box is inclosed in this letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other box, which contains my own dresses, you will be kind enough\r\nto forward to this house. I do not ask you to bring it yourself,\r\nbecause I have a far more important commission to intrust to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReferring to the note which you left for me at your departure, I\r\nconclude that you have by this time traced Mr. Noel Vanstone from\r\nVauxhall Walk to the residence which he is now occupying. If you have\r\nmade the discovery\xe2\x80\x94and if you are quite sure of not having drawn the\r\nattention either of Mrs. Lecount or her master to yourself\xe2\x80\x94I wish you\r\nto arrange immediately for my residing (with you and Mrs. Wragge) in\r\nthe same town or village in which Mr. Noel Vanstone has taken up his\r\nabode. I write this, it is hardly necessary to say, under the\r\nimpression that, wherever he may now be living, he is settled in the\r\nplace for some little time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can find a small furnished house for me on these conditions\r\nwhich is to be let by the month, take it for a month certain to begin\r\nwith. Say that it is for your wife, your niece, and yourself, and use\r\nany assumed name you please, as long as it is a name that can be\r\ntrusted to defeat the most suspicious inquiries. I leave this to your\r\nexperience in such matters. The secret of who we really are must be\r\nkept as strictly as if it was a secret on which our lives depend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny expenses to which you may be put in carrying out my wishes I will\r\nimmediately repay. If you easily find the sort of house I want, there\r\nis no need for your returning to London to fetch us. We can join you as\r\nsoon as we know where to go. The house must be perfectly respectable,\r\nand must be reasonably near to Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s present residence,\r\nwherever that is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must allow me to be silent in this letter as to the object which I\r\nhave now in view. I am unwilling to risk an explanation in writing.\r\nWhen all our preparations are made, you shall hear what I propose to do\r\nfrom my own lips; and I shall expect you to tell me plainly, in return,\r\nwhether you will or will not give me the help I want on the best terms\r\nwhich I am able to offer you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more before I seal up this letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf any opportunity falls in your way after you have taken the house,\r\nand before we join you, of exchanging a few civil words either with Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone or Mrs. Lecount, take advantage of it. It is very\r\nimportant to my present object that we should become acquainted with\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x94as the purely accidental result of our being near neighbors.\r\nI want you to smooth the way toward this end if you can, before Mrs.\r\nWragge and I come to you. Pray throw away no chance of observing Mrs.\r\nLecount, in particular, very carefully. Whatever help you can give me\r\nat the outset in blindfolding that woman\xe2\x80\x99s sharp eyes will be the most\r\nprecious help I have ever received at your hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to answer this letter immediately\xe2\x80\x94unless I have\r\nwritten it under a mistaken impression of what you have accomplished\r\nsince leaving London. I have taken our lodgings on for another week;\r\nand I can wait to hear from you until you are able to send me such news\r\nas I wish to receive. You may be quite sure of my patience for the\r\nfuture, under all possible circumstances. My caprices are at an end,\r\nand my violent temper has tried your forbearance for the last time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAGDALEN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nFrom Captain Wragge to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorth Shingles Villa, Aldborough, Suffolk,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 22d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR GIRL,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour letter has charmed and touched me. Your excuses have gone\r\nstraight to my heart; and your confidence in my humble abilities has\r\nfollowed in the same direction. The pulse of the old militia-man throbs\r\nwith pride as he thinks of the trust you have placed in him, and vows\r\nto deserve it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised at this genial outburst. All\r\nenthusiastic natures must explode occasionally; and _my_ form of\r\nexplosion is\xe2\x80\x94Words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything you wanted me to do is done. The house is taken; the name\r\nis found; and I am personally acquainted with Mrs. Lecount. After\r\nreading this general statement, you will naturally be interested in\r\npossessing your mind next of the accompanying details. Here they are,\r\nat your service:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day after leaving you in London, I traced Mr. Noel Vanstone to\r\nthis curious little seaside snuggery. One of his father\xe2\x80\x99s innumerable\r\nbargains was a house at Aldborough\xe2\x80\x94a rising watering-place, or Mr.\r\nMichael Vanstone would not have invested a farthing in it. In this\r\nhouse the despicable little miser, who lived rent free in London, now\r\nlives, rent free again, on the coast of Suffolk. He is settled in his\r\npresent abode for the summer and autumn; and you and Mrs. Wragge have\r\nonly to join me here, to be established five doors away from him in\r\nthis elegant villa. I have got the whole house for three guineas a\r\nweek, with the option of remaining through the autumn at the same\r\nprice. In a fashionable watering-place, such a residence would have\r\nbeen cheap at double the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur new name has been chosen with a wary eye to your suggestions. My\r\nbooks\xe2\x80\x94I hope you have not forgotten my Books?\xe2\x80\x94contain, under the\r\nheading of _Skins To Jump Into,_ a list of individuals retired from\r\nthis mortal scene, with whose names, families, and circumstances I am\r\nwell acquainted. Into some of those Skins I have been compelled to\r\nJump, in the exercise of my profession, at former periods of my career.\r\nOthers are still in the condition of new dresses and remain to be tried\r\non. The Skin which will exactly fit us originally clothed the bodies of\r\na family named Bygrave. I am in Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s skin at this moment-and\r\nit fits without a wrinkle. If you will oblige me by slipping into Miss\r\nBygrave (Christian name, Susan); and if you will afterward push Mrs.\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x94anyhow; head foremost if you like\xe2\x80\x94into Mrs. Bygrave (Christian\r\nname, Julia), the transformation will be complete. Permit me to inform\r\nyou that I am your paternal uncle. My worthy brother was established\r\ntwenty years ago in the mahogany and logwood trade at Belize, Honduras.\r\nHe died in that place; and is buried on the south-west side of the\r\nlocal cemetery, with a neat monument of native wood carved by a\r\nself-taught negro artist. Nineteen months afterward his widow died of\r\napoplexy at a boarding-house in Cheltenham. She was supposed to be the\r\nmost corpulent woman in England, and was accommodated on the\r\nground-floor of the house in consequence of the difficulty of getting\r\nher up and down stairs. You are her only child; you have been under my\r\ncare since the sad event at Cheltenham; you are twenty-one years old on\r\nthe second of August next; and, corpulence excepted, you are the living\r\nimage of your mother. I trouble you with these specimens of my intimate\r\nknowledge of our new family Skin, to quiet your mind on the subject of\r\nfuture inquiries. Trust to me and my books to satisfy any amount of\r\ninquiry. In the meantime write down our new name and address, and see\r\nhow they strike you: \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bygrave, Mrs. Bygrave, Miss Bygrave; North\r\nShingles Villa, Aldborough.\xe2\x80\x99 Upon my life, it reads remarkably well!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last detail I have to communicate refers to my acquaintance with\r\nMrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe met yesterday, in the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s shop here. Keeping my ears open, I\r\nfound that Mrs. Lecount wanted a particular kind of tea which the man\r\nhad not got, and which he believed could not be procured any nearer\r\nthan Ipswich. I instantly saw my way to beginning an acquaintance, at\r\nthe trifling expense of a journey to that flourishing city. \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nbusiness to-day in Ipswich,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98and I propose returning to\r\nAldborough (if I can get back in time) this evening. Pray allow me to\r\ntake your order for the tea, and to bring it back with my own parcels.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMrs. Lecount politely declined giving me the trouble\xe2\x80\x94I politely\r\ninsisted on taking it. We fell into conversation. There is no need to\r\ntrouble you with our talk. The result of it on my mind is\xe2\x80\x94that Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s one weak point, if she has such a thing at all, is a taste\r\nfor science, implanted by her deceased husband, the professor. I think\r\nI see a chance here of working my way into her good graces, and casting\r\na little needful dust into those handsome black eyes of hers. Acting on\r\nthis idea when I purchased the lady\xe2\x80\x99s tea at Ipswich, I also bought on\r\nmy own account that far-famed pocket-manual of knowledge, \xe2\x80\x98Joyce\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nScientific Dialogues.\xe2\x80\x99 Possessing, as I do, a quick memory and\r\nboundless confidence in myself, I propose privately inflating my new\r\nskin with as much ready-made science as it will hold, and presenting\r\nMr. Bygrave to Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s notice in the character of the most\r\nhighly informed man she has met with since the professor\xe2\x80\x99s death. The\r\nnecessity of blindfolding that woman (to use your own admirable\r\nexpression) is as clear to me as to you. If it is to be done in the way\r\nI propose, make your mind easy\xe2\x80\x94Wragge, inflated by Joyce, is the man to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou now have my whole budget of news. Am I, or am I not, worthy of\r\nyour confidence in me? I say nothing of my devouring anxiety to know\r\nwhat your objects really are\xe2\x80\x94that anxiety will be satisfied when we\r\nmeet. Never yet, my dear girl, did I long to administer a productive\r\npecuniary Squeeze to any human creature, as I long to administer it to\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone. I say no more. _Verbum sap._ Pardon the pedantry of\r\na Latin quotation, and believe me,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntirely yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHORATIO WRAGGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.\xe2\x80\x94I await my instructions, as you requested. You have only to say\r\nwhether I shall return to London for the purpose of escorting you to\r\nthis place, or whether I shall wait here to receive you. The house is\r\nin perfect order, the weather is charming, and the sea is as smooth as\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s apron. She has just passed the window, and we have\r\nexchanged bows. A sharp woman, my dear Magdalen; but Joyce and I\r\ntogether may prove a trifle too much for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n_Extract from the East Suffolk Argus._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALDBOROUGH.\xe2\x80\x94We notice with pleasure the arrival of visitors to this\r\nhealthful and far-famed watering-place earlier in the season than usual\r\nduring the present year. _Esto Perpetua_ is all we have to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVISITORS\xe2\x80\x99 LIST.\xe2\x80\x94Arrivals since our last. North Shingles Villa\xe2\x80\x94Mrs.\r\nBygrave; Miss Bygrave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH SCENE.\r\nALDBOROUGH, SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe most striking spectacle presented to a stranger by the shores of\r\nSuffolk is the extraordinary defenselessness of the land against the\r\nencroachments of the sea.\r\n\r\nAt Aldborough, as elsewhere on this coast, local traditions are, for\r\nthe most part, traditions which have been literally drowned. The site\r\nof the old town, once a populous and thriving port, has almost entirely\r\ndisappeared in the sea. The German Ocean has swallowed up streets,\r\nmarket-places, jetties, and public walks; and the merciless waters,\r\nconsummating their work of devastation, closed, no longer than eighty\r\nyears since, over the salt-master\xe2\x80\x99s cottage at Aldborough, now famous\r\nin memory only as the birthplace of the poet CRABBE.\r\n\r\nThrust back year after year by the advancing waves, the inhabitants\r\nhave receded, in the present century, to the last morsel of land which\r\nis firm enough to be built on\xe2\x80\x94a strip of ground hemmed in between a\r\nmarsh on one side and the sea on the other. Here, trusting for their\r\nfuture security to certain sand-hills which the capricious waves have\r\nthrown up to encourage them, the people of Aldborough have boldly\r\nestablished their quaint little watering-place. The first fragment of\r\ntheir earthly possessions is a low natural dike of shingle, surmounted\r\nby a public path which runs parallel with the sea. Bordering this path,\r\nin a broken, uneven line, are the villa residences of modern\r\nAldborough\xe2\x80\x94fanciful little houses, standing mostly in their own\r\ngardens, and possessing here and there, as horticultural ornaments,\r\nstaring figure-heads of ships doing duty for statues among the flowers.\r\nViewed from the low level on which these villas stand, the sea, in\r\ncertain conditions of the atmosphere, appears to be higher than the\r\nland: coasting-vessels gliding by assume gigantic proportions, and look\r\nalarmingly near the windows. Intermixed with the houses of the better\r\nsort are buildings of other forms and periods. In one direction the\r\ntiny Gothic town-hall of old Aldborough\xe2\x80\x94once the center of the vanished\r\nport and borough\xe2\x80\x94now stands, fronting the modern villas close on the\r\nmargin of the sea. At another point, a wooden tower of observation,\r\ncrowned by the figure-head of a wrecked Russian vessel, rises high\r\nabove the neighboring houses, and discloses through its scuttle-window\r\ngrave men in dark clothing seated on the topmost story, perpetually on\r\nthe watch\xe2\x80\x94the pilots of Aldborough looking out from their tower for\r\nships in want of help. Behind the row of buildings thus curiously\r\nintermingled runs the one straggling street of the town, with its\r\nsturdy pilots\xe2\x80\x99 cottages, its mouldering marine store-houses, and its\r\ncomposite shops. Toward the northern end this street is bounded by the\r\none eminence visible over all the marshy flat\xe2\x80\x94a low wooded hill, on\r\nwhich the church is built. At its opposite extremity the street leads\r\nto a deserted martello tower, and to the forlorn outlying suburb of\r\nSlaughden, between the river Alde and the sea. Such are the main\r\ncharacteristics of this curious little outpost on the shores of England\r\nas it appears at the present time.\r\n\r\nOn a hot and cloudy July afternoon, and on the second day which had\r\nelapsed since he had written to Magdalen, Captain Wragge sauntered\r\nthrough the gate of North Shingles Villa to meet the arrival of the\r\ncoach, which then connected Aldborough with the Eastern Counties\r\nRailway. He reached the principal inn as the coach drove up, and was\r\nready at the door to receive Magdalen and Mrs. Wragge, on their leaving\r\nthe vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s reception of his wife was not characterized by an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary waste of time. He looked distrustfully at her\r\nshoes\xe2\x80\x94raised himself on tiptoe\xe2\x80\x94set her bonnet straight for her with a\r\nsharp tug\xe2\x80\x94-said, in a loud whisper, \xe2\x80\x9chold your tongue\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and left her,\r\nfor the time being, without further notice. His welcome to Magdalen,\r\nbeginning with the usual flow of words, stopped suddenly in the middle\r\nof the first sentence. Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s eye was a sharp one, and it\r\ninstantly showed him something in the look and manner of his old pupil\r\nwhich denoted a serious change.\r\n\r\nThere was a settled composure on her face which, except when she spoke,\r\nmade it look as still and cold as marble. Her voice was softer and more\r\nequable, her eyes were steadier, her step was slower than of old. When\r\nshe smiled, the smile came and went suddenly, and showed a little\r\nnervous contraction on one side of her mouth never visible there\r\nbefore. She was perfectly patient with Mrs. Wragge; she treated the\r\ncaptain with a courtesy and consideration entirely new in his\r\nexperience of her\xe2\x80\x94but she was interested in nothing. The curious little\r\nshops in the back street; the high impending sea; the old town-hall on\r\nthe beach; the pilots, the fishermen, the passing ships\xe2\x80\x94she noticed all\r\nthese objects as indifferently as if Aldborough had been familiar to\r\nher from her infancy. Even when the captain drew up at the garden-gate\r\nof North Shingles, and introduced her triumphantly to the new house,\r\nshe hardly looked at it. The first question she asked related not to\r\nher own residence, but to Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow near to us does he live?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, with the only betrayal of\r\nemotion which had escaped her yet.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge answered by pointing to the fifth villa from North\r\nShingles, on the Slaughden side of Aldborough. Magdalen suddenly drew\r\nback from the garden-gate as he indicated the situation, and walked\r\naway by herself to obtain a nearer view of the house. Captain Wragge\r\nlooked after her, and shook his head, discontentedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I speak now?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired a meek voice behind him, articulating\r\nrespectfully ten inches above the top of his straw hat.\r\n\r\nThe captain turned round, and confronted his wife. The more than\r\nordinary bewilderment visible in her face at once suggested to him that\r\nMagdalen had failed to carry out the directions in his letter; and that\r\nMrs. Wragge had arrived at Aldborough without being properly aware of\r\nthe total transformation to be accomplished in her identity and her\r\nname. The necessity of setting this doubt at rest was too serious to be\r\ntrifled with; and Captain Wragge instituted the necessary inquiries\r\nwithout a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand straight, and listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a question to ask\r\nyou. Do you know whose Skin you are in at this moment? Do you know that\r\nyou are dead and buried in London; and that you have risen like a\r\nphoenix from the ashes of Mrs. Wragge? No! you evidently don\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\r\nThis is perfectly disgraceful. What is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatilda,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Wragge, in a state of the densest\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain, fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you tell\r\nme your name\xe2\x80\x99s Matilda? Your name is Julia. Who am I?\xe2\x80\x94Hold that basket\r\nof sandwiches straight, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll pitch it into the sea!\xe2\x80\x94Who am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, meekly taking refuge in the negative\r\nside of the question this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down!\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, pointing to the low garden wall of North\r\nShingles Villa. \xe2\x80\x9cMore to the right! More still! That will do. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the captain, sternly confronting his wife as soon as he\r\nhad contrived, by seating her, to place her face on a level with his\r\nown. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me hear you say that a second time. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me have a\r\nwoman who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know who I am to operate on my beard to-morrow\r\nmorning. Look at me! More to the left\xe2\x80\x94more still\xe2\x80\x94that will do. Who am\r\nI? I\xe2\x80\x99m Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94Christian name, Thomas. Who are you? You\xe2\x80\x99re Mrs.\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x94Christian name, Julia. Who is that young lady who traveled with\r\nyou from London? That young lady is Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94Christian name, Susan.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m her clever uncle Tom; and you\xe2\x80\x99re her addle-headed aunt Julia. Say\r\nit all over to me instantly, like the Catechism! What is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare my poor head!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, please spare my poor\r\nhead till I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the stage-coach out of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t distress her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, joining them at that moment. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwill learn it in time. Come into the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge shook his wary head once more. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are beginning badly,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, with less politeness than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity stands\r\nin our way already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went into the house. Magdalen was perfectly satisfied with all the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements; she accepted the room which he had set apart\r\nfor her; approved of the woman servant whom he had engaged; presented\r\nherself at tea-time the moment she was summoned but still showed no\r\ninterest whatever in the new scene around her. Soon after the table was\r\ncleared, although the daylight had not yet faded out, Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncustomary drowsiness after fatigue of any kind overcame her, and she\r\nreceived her husband\xe2\x80\x99s orders to leave the room (taking care that she\r\nleft it \xe2\x80\x9cup at heel\xe2\x80\x9d), and to betake herself (strictly in the character\r\nof Mrs. Bygrave) to bed. As soon as they were left alone, the captain\r\nlooked hard at Magdalen, and waited to be spoken to. She said nothing.\r\nHe ventured next on opening the conversation by a polite inquiry after\r\nthe state of her health. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look fatigued,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, in his most\r\ninsinuating manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid the journey has been too much for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking out listlessly through the window; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not\r\nmore tired than usual. I am always weary now; weary at going to bed,\r\nweary at getting up. If you would like to hear what I have to say to\r\nyou to-night, I am willing and ready to say it. Can\xe2\x80\x99t we go out? It is\r\nvery hot here; and the droning of those men\xe2\x80\x99s voices is beyond all\r\nendurance.\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed through the window to a group of boatmen\r\nidling, as only nautical men can idle, against the garden wall. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthere no quiet walk in this wretched place?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, impatiently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we breathe a little fresh air, and escape being annoyed by\r\nstrangers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is perfect solitude within half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s walk of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied the ready captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Come out, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a weary sigh she took up her straw bonnet and her light muslin\r\nscarf from the side-table upon which she had thrown them on coming in,\r\nand carelessly led the way to the door. Captain Wragge followed her to\r\nthe garden gate, then stopped, struck by a new idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, confidentially. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my wife\xe2\x80\x99s existing state\r\nof ignorance as to who she is, we had better not trust her alone in the\r\nhouse with a new servant. I\xe2\x80\x99ll privately turn the key on her, in case\r\nshe wakes before we come back. Safe bind, safe find\xe2\x80\x94you know the\r\nproverb!\xe2\x80\x94I will be with you again in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hastened back to the house, and Magdalen seated herself on the\r\ngarden wall to await his return.\r\n\r\nShe had hardly settled herself in that position when two gentlemen\r\nwalking together, whose approach along the public path she had not\r\npreviously noticed, passed close by her.\r\n\r\nThe dress of one of the two strangers showed him to be a clergyman. His\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s station in life was less easily discernible to ordinary\r\nobservation. Practiced eyes would probably have seen enough in his\r\nlook, his manner, and his walk to show that he was a sailor. He was a\r\nman in the prime of life; tall, spare, and muscular; his face\r\nsun-burned to a deep brown; his black hair just turning gray; his eyes\r\ndark, deep and firm\xe2\x80\x94the eyes of a man with an iron resolution and a\r\nhabit of command. He was the nearest of the two to Magdalen, as he and\r\nhis friend passed the place where she was sitting; and he looked at her\r\nwith a sudden surprise at her beauty, with an open, hearty, undisguised\r\nadmiration, which was too evidently sincere, too evidently beyond his\r\nown control, to be justly resented as insolent; and yet, in her humor\r\nat that moment, Magdalen did resent it. She felt the man\xe2\x80\x99s resolute\r\nblack eyes strike through her with an electric suddenness; and frowning\r\nat him impatiently, she turned away her head and looked back at the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe next moment she glanced round again to see if he had gone on. He\r\nhad advanced a few yards\xe2\x80\x94had then evidently stopped\xe2\x80\x94and was now in the\r\nvery act of turning to look at her once more. His companion, the\r\nclergyman, noticing that Magdalen appeared to be annoyed, took him\r\nfamiliarly by the arm, and, half in jest, half in earnest, forced him\r\nto walk on. The two disappeared round the corner of the next house. As\r\nthey turned it, the sun-burned sailor twice stopped his companion\r\nagain, and twice looked back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Captain Wragge, joining Magdalen at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9ca perfect stranger. He stared at me in\r\nthe most impertinent manner. Does he belong to this place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll find out in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the compliant captain, joining the\r\ngroup of boatmen, and putting his questions right and left, with the\r\neasy familiarity which distinguished him. He returned in a few minutes\r\nwith a complete budget of information. The clergyman was well known as\r\nthe rector of a place situated some few miles inland. The dark man with\r\nhim was his wife\xe2\x80\x99s brother, commander of a ship in the\r\nmerchant-service. He was supposed to be staying with his relatives, as\r\ntheir guest for a short time only, preparatory to sailing on another\r\nvoyage. The clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s name was Strickland, and the merchant-captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname was Kirke; and that was all the boatmen knew about either of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of no consequence who they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s rudeness merely annoyed me for the moment. Let us have done with\r\nhim. I have something else to think of, and so have you. Where is the\r\nsolitary walk you mentioned just now? Which way do we go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain pointed southward toward Slaughden, and offered his arm.\r\n\r\nMagdalen hesitated before she took it. Her eyes wandered away\r\ninquiringly to Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s house. He was out in the garden, pacing\r\nbackward and forward over the little lawn, with his head high in the\r\nair, and with Mrs. Lecount demurely in attendance on him, carrying her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s green fan. Seeing this, Magdalen at once took Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright arm, so as to place herself nearest to the garden when they\r\npassed it on their walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes of our neighbors are on us; and the least your niece can do\r\nis to take your arm,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a bitter laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! let us go\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are looking this way,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I introduce\r\nyou to Mrs. Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWait, and hear what I have to say to you\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey passed the garden wall. Captain Wragge took off his hat with a\r\nsmart flourish, and received a gracious bow from Mrs. Lecount in\r\nreturn. Magdalen saw the housekeeper survey her face, her figure, and\r\nher dress, with that reluctant interest, that distrustful curiosity,\r\nwhich women feel in observing each other. As she walked on beyond the\r\nhouse, the sharp voice of Noel Vanstone reached her through the evening\r\nstillness. \xe2\x80\x9cA fine girl, Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d she heard him say. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I am a\r\njudge of that sort of thing\xe2\x80\x94a fine girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs those words were spoken, Captain Wragge looked round at his\r\ncompanion in sudden surprise. Her hand was trembling violently on his\r\narm, and her lips were fast closed with an expression of speechless\r\npain.\r\n\r\nSlowly and in silence the two walked on until they reached the southern\r\nlimit of the houses, and entered on a little wilderness of shingle and\r\nwithered grass\xe2\x80\x94the desolate end of Aldborough, the lonely beginning of\r\nSlaughden.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, airless evening. Eastward, was the gray majesty of the\r\nsea, hushed in breathless calm; the horizon line invisibly melting into\r\nthe monotonous, misty sky; the idle ships shadowy and still on the idle\r\nwater. Southward, the high ridge of the sea dike, and the grim, massive\r\ncircle of a martello tower reared high on its mound of grass, closed\r\nthe view darkly on all that lay beyond. Westward, a lurid streak of\r\nsunset glowed red in the dreary heaven, blackened the fringing trees on\r\nthe far borders of the great inland marsh, and turned its little\r\ngleaming water-pools to pools of blood. Nearer to the eye, the sullen\r\nflow of the tidal river Alde ebbed noiselessly from the muddy banks;\r\nand nearer still, lonely and unprosperous by the bleak water-side, lay\r\nthe lost little port of Slaughden, with its forlorn wharfs and\r\nwarehouses of decaying wood, and its few scattered coasting-vessels\r\ndeserted on the oozy river-shore. No fall of waves was heard on the\r\nbeach, no trickling of waters bubbled audibly from the idle stream. Now\r\nand then the cry of a sea-bird rose from the region of the marsh; and\r\nat intervals, from farmhouses far in the inland waste, the faint\r\nwinding of horns to call the cattle home traveled mournfully through\r\nthe evening calm.\r\n\r\nMagdalen drew her hand from the captain\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and led the way to the\r\nmound of the martello tower. \xe2\x80\x9cI am weary of walking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\nstop and rest here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seated herself on the slope, and resting on her elbow, mechanically\r\npulled up and scattered from her into the air the tufts of grass\r\ngrowing under her hand. After silently occupying herself in this way\r\nfor some minutes, she turned suddenly on Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I surprise\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a startling abruptness. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you find me changed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s ready tact warned him that the time had come to be plain\r\nwith her, and to reserve his flowers of speech for a more appropriate\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask the question, I must answer it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do\r\nfind you changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pulled up another tuft of grass. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you can guess the\r\nreason?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe captain was wisely silent. He only answered by a bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost all care for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, tearing faster and\r\nfaster at the tufts of grass. \xe2\x80\x9cSaying that is not saying much, perhaps,\r\nbut it may help you to understand me. There are things I would have\r\ndied sooner than do at one time\xe2\x80\x94things it would have turned me cold to\r\nthink of. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care now whether I do them or not. I am nothing to\r\nmyself; I am no more interested in myself than I am in these handfuls\r\nof grass. I suppose I have lost something. What is it? Heart?\r\nConscience? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Do you? What nonsense I am talking! Who cares\r\nwhat I have lost? It has gone; and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it. I suppose my\r\noutside is the best side of me\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s left, at any rate. I have not\r\nlost my good looks, have I? There! there! never mind answering; don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrouble yourself to pay me compliments. I have been admired enough\r\nto-day. First the sailor, and then Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94enough for any\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s vanity, surely! Have I any right to call myself a woman?\r\nPerhaps not: I am only a girl in my teens. Oh, me, I feel as if I was\r\nforty!\xe2\x80\x9d She scattered the last fragments of grass to the winds; and\r\nturning her back on the captain, let her head droop till her cheek\r\ntouched the turf bank. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels soft and friendly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, nestling\r\nto it with a hopeless tenderness horrible to see. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cast me\r\noff. Mother Earth! The only mother I have left!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge looked at her in silent surprise. Such experience of\r\nhumanity as he possessed was powerless to sound to its depths the\r\nterrible self-abandonment which had burst its way to the surface in her\r\nreckless words\xe2\x80\x94which was now fast hurrying her to actions more reckless\r\nstill. \xe2\x80\x9cDevilish odd!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cHas the loss\r\nof her lover turned her brain?\xe2\x80\x9d He considered for a minute longer and\r\nthen spoke to her. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave it till to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the captain\r\nconfidentially. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a little tired to-night. No hurry, my dear\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x94no hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her head instantly, and looked round at him with the same\r\nangry resolution, with the same desperate defiance of herself, which he\r\nhad seen in her face on the memorable day at York when she had acted\r\nbefore him for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cI came here to tell you what is in my\r\nmind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I _will_ tell it!\xe2\x80\x9d She seated herself upright on\r\nthe slope; and clasping her hands round her knees, looked out steadily,\r\nstraight before her, at the slowly darkening view. In that strange\r\nposition, she waited until she had composed herself, and then addressed\r\nthe captain, without turning her head to look round at him, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you and I first met,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cI tried hard to keep\r\nmy thoughts to myself. I know enough by this time to know that I\r\nfailed. When I first told you at York that Michael Vanstone had ruined\r\nus, I believe you guessed for yourself that I, for one, was determined\r\nnot to submit to it. Whether you guessed or not, it is so. I left my\r\nfriends with that determination in my mind; and I feel it in me now\r\nstronger, ten times stronger, than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen times stronger than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cExactly so\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnatural result of firmness of character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94the natural result of having nothing else to think of. I had\r\nsomething else to think of before you found me ill in Vauxhall Walk. I\r\nhave nothing else to think of now. Remember that, if you find me for\r\nthe future always harping on the same string. One question first. Did\r\nyou guess what I meant to do on that morning when you showed me the\r\nnewspaper, and when I read the account of Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI guessed, generally, that you\r\nproposed dipping your hand into his purse and taking from it (most\r\nproperly) what was your own. I felt deeply hurt at the time by your not\r\npermitting me to assist you. Why is she so reserved with me? (I\r\nremarked to myself)\xe2\x80\x94why is she so unreasonably reserved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have no reserve to complain of now,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntell you plainly, if events had not happened as they did, you _would_\r\nhave assisted me. If Michael Vanstone had not died, I should have gone\r\nto Brighton, and have found my way safely to his acquaintance under an\r\nassumed name. I had money enough with me to live on respectably for\r\nmany months together. I would have employed that time\xe2\x80\x94I would have\r\nwaited a whole year, if necessary, to destroy Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s influence\r\nover him\xe2\x80\x94and I would have ended by getting that influence, on my own\r\nterms, into my own hands. I had the advantage of years, the advantage\r\nof novelty, the advantage of downright desperation, all on my side, and\r\nI should have succeeded. Before the year was out\xe2\x80\x94before half the year\r\nwas out\xe2\x80\x94you should have seen Mrs. Lecount dismissed by her master, and\r\nyou should have seen me taken into the house in her place, as Michael\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s adopted daughter\xe2\x80\x94as the faithful friend\xe2\x80\x94who had saved him\r\nfrom an adventuress in his old age. Girls no older than I am have tried\r\ndeceptions as hopeless in appearance as mine, and have carried them\r\nthrough to the end. I had my story ready; I had my plans all\r\nconsidered; I had the weak point in that old man to attack in my way,\r\nwhich Mrs. Lecount had found out before me to attack in hers, and I\r\ntell you again I should have succeeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you would,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Michael Vanstone would have changed his man of business next. You\r\nwould have succeeded to the place; and those clever speculations on\r\nwhich he was so fond of venturing would have cost him the fortunes of\r\nwhich he had robbed my sister and myself. To the last farthing, Captain\r\nWragge, as certainly as you sit there, to the last farthing! A bold\r\nconspiracy, a shocking deception\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! Any\r\nconspiracy, any deception, is justified to my conscience by the vile\r\nlaw which has left us helpless. You talked of my reserve just now. Have\r\nI dropped it at last? Have I spoken out at the eleventh hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain laid his hand solemnly on his heart, and launched himself\r\nonce more on his broadest flow of language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fill me with unavailing regret,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that old man had\r\nlived, what a crop I might have reaped from him! What enormous\r\ntransactions in moral agriculture it might have been my privilege to\r\ncarry on! _Ars longa,_\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, pathetically drifting into\r\nLatin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_vita brevis!_ Let us drop a tear on the lost opportunities of\r\nthe past, and try what the present can do to console us. One conclusion\r\nis clear to my mind\xe2\x80\x94the experiment you proposed to try with Mr. Michael\r\nVanstone is totally hopeless, my dear girl, in the case of his son. His\r\nson is impervious to all common forms of pecuniary temptation. You may\r\ntrust my solemn assurance,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain, speaking with an\r\nindignant recollection of the answer to his advertisement in the Times,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen I inform you that Mr. Noel Vanstone is emphatically the meanest\r\nof mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can trust my own experience as well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen\r\nhim, and spoken to him\xe2\x80\x94I know him better than you do. Another\r\ndisclosure, Captain Wragge, for your private ear! I sent you back\r\ncertain articles of costume when they had served the purpose for which\r\nI took them to London. That purpose was to find my way to Noel Vanstone\r\nin disguise, and to judge for myself of Mrs. Lecount and her master. I\r\ngained my object; and I tell you again, I know the two people in that\r\nhouse yonder whom we have now to deal with better than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge expressed the profound astonishment, and asked the\r\ninnocent questions appropriate to the mental condition of a person\r\ntaken completely by surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, when Magdalen had briefly answered him, \xe2\x80\x9cand what\r\nis the result on your own mind? There must be a result, or we should\r\nnot be here. You see your way? Of course, my dear girl, you see your\r\nway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI see my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain drew a little nearer to her, with eager curiosity expressed\r\nin every line of his vagabond face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an anxious whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cpray go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked out thoughtfully into the gathering darkness, without\r\nanswering, without appearing to have heard him. Her lips closed, and\r\nher clasped hands tightened mechanically round her knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no disguising the fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, warily rousing\r\nher into speaking to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe son is harder to deal with than the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in my way,\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWell! they say there is a short cut to\r\neverything, if we only look long enough to find it. You have looked\r\nlong enough, I suppose, and the natural result has followed\xe2\x80\x94you have\r\nfound it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not troubled myself to look; I have found it without looking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce you have!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Captain Wragge, in great perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndear girl, is my view of your present position leading me altogether\r\nastray? As I understand it, here is Mr. Noel Vanstone in possession of\r\nyour fortune and your sister\xe2\x80\x99s, as his father was, and determined to\r\nkeep it, as his father was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here are you\xe2\x80\x94quite helpless to get it by persuasion\xe2\x80\x94quite helpless\r\nto get it by law\xe2\x80\x94just as resolute in his case as you were in his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s, to take it by stratagem in spite of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as resolute. Not for the sake of the fortune\xe2\x80\x94mind that! For the\r\nsake of the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so. And the means of coming at that right which were hard with\r\nthe father\xe2\x80\x94who was not a miser\xe2\x80\x94are easy with the son, who is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite me down an Ass for the first time in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\ncaptain, at the end of his patience. \xe2\x80\x9cHang me if I know what you mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked round at him for the first time\xe2\x80\x94looked him straight and\r\nsteadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge started up on his knees, and stopped on them, petrified\r\nby astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember what I told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, looking away from him again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost all care for myself. I have only one end in life now, and\r\nthe sooner I reach it\xe2\x80\x94and die\xe2\x80\x94the better. If\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, altered her\r\nposition a little, and pointed with one hand to the fast-ebbing stream\r\nbeneath her, gleaming dim in the darkening twilight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif I had been what\r\nI once was, I would have thrown myself into that river sooner than do\r\nwhat I am going to do now. As it is, I trouble myself no longer; I\r\nweary my mind with no more schemes. The short way and the vile way lies\r\nbefore me. I take it, Captain Wragge, and marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeeping him in total ignorance of who you are?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain,\r\nslowly rising to his feet, and slowly moving round, so as to see her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cMarrying him as my niece, Miss Bygrave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs your niece, Miss Bygrave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after the marriage\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d His voice faltered, as he began the\r\nquestion, and he left it unfinished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall stand in no further need of\r\nyour assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain stooped as she gave him that answer, looked close at her,\r\nand suddenly drew back, without uttering a word. He walked away some\r\npaces, and sat down again doggedly on the grass. If Magdalen could have\r\nseen his face in the dying light, his face would have startled her. For\r\nthe first time, probably, since his boyhood, Captain Wragge had changed\r\ncolor. He was deadly pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you nothing to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are waiting to\r\nhear what terms I have to offer? These are my terms; I pay all our\r\nexpenses here; and when we part, on the day of the marriage, you take a\r\nfarewell gift away with you of two hundred pounds. Do you promise me\r\nyour assistance on those conditions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I expected to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a furtive glance at her, and\r\na sudden distrust in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are expected to preserve my assumed character and your own,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cand you are to prevent any inquiries of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s from\r\ndiscovering who I really am. I ask no more. The rest is my\r\nresponsibility\xe2\x80\x94not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to do with what happens\xe2\x80\x94at any time, or in any\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94after the marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may leave you at the church door if I please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the church door, with your fee in your pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaid from the money in your own possession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! How else should I pay it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge took off his hat, and passed his handkerchief over his\r\nface with an air of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a minute to consider it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs many minutes as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, reclining on the bank in\r\nher former position, and returning to her former occupation of tearing\r\nup the tufts of grass and flinging them out into the air.\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s reflections were not complicated by any unnecessary\r\ndivergences from the contemplation of his own position to the\r\ncontemplation of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s. Utterly incapable of appreciating the\r\ninjury done her by Frank\xe2\x80\x99s infamous treachery to his engagement\xe2\x80\x94an\r\ninjury which had severed her, at one cruel blow, from the aspiration\r\nwhich, delusion though it was, had been the saving aspiration of her\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94Captain Wragge accepted the simple fact of her despair just as he\r\nfound it, and then looked straight to the consequences of the proposal\r\nwhich she had made to him.\r\n\r\nIn the prospect _before_ the marriage he saw nothing more serious\r\ninvolved than the practice of a deception, in no important degree\r\ndifferent\xe2\x80\x94except in the end to be attained by it\xe2\x80\x94from the deceptions\r\nwhich his vagabond life had long since accustomed him to contemplate\r\nand to carry out. In the prospect _after_ the marriage he dimly\r\ndiscerned, through the ominous darkness of the future, the lurking\r\nphantoms of Terror and Crime, and the black gulfs behind them of Ruin\r\nand Death. A man of boundless audacity and resource, within his own\r\nmean limits; beyond those limits, the captain was as deferentially\r\nsubmissive to the majesty of the law as the most harmless man in\r\nexistence; as cautious in looking after his own personal safety as the\r\nveriest coward that ever walked the earth. But one serious question now\r\nfilled his mind. Could he, on the terms proposed to him, join the\r\nconspiracy against Noel Vanstone up to the point of the marriage, and\r\nthen withdraw from it, without risk of involving himself in the\r\nconsequences which his experience told him must certainly ensue?\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, his decision in this emergency was mainly\r\ninfluenced by no less a person than Noel Vanstone himself. The captain\r\nmight have resisted the money-offer which Magdalen had made to him\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe profits of the Entertainment had filled his pockets with more than\r\nthree times two hundred pounds. But the prospect of dealing a blow in\r\nthe dark at the man who had estimated his information and himself at\r\nthe value of a five pound note proved too much for his caution and his\r\nself-control. On the small neutral ground of self-importance, the best\r\nmen and the worst meet on the same terms. Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s indignation,\r\nwhen he saw the answer to his advertisement, stooped to no\r\nretrospective estimate of his own conduct; he was as deeply offended,\r\nas sincerely angry as if he had made a perfectly honorable proposal,\r\nand had been rewarded for it by a personal insult. He had been too full\r\nof his own grievance to keep it out of his first letter to Magdalen. He\r\nhad more or less forgotten himself on every subsequent occasion when\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned. And in now finally deciding the\r\ncourse he should take, it is not too much to say that the motive of\r\nmoney receded, for the first time in his life, into the second place,\r\nand the motive of malice carried the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept the terms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, getting briskly on his legs\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cSubject, of course, to the conditions agreed on between us. We\r\npart on the wedding-day. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask where you go: you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask where\r\nI go. From that time forth we are strangers to each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen rose slowly from the mound. A hopeless depression, a sullen\r\ndespair, showed itself in her look and manner. She refused the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s offered hand; and her tones, when she answered him, were so\r\nlow that he could hardly hear her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe understand each other,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand we can now go back. You may\r\nintroduce me to Mrs. Lecount to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask a few questions first,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nare more risks to be run in this matter, and more pitfalls in our way,\r\nthan you seem to suppose. I must know the whole history of your morning\r\ncall on Mrs. Lecount before I put you and that woman on speaking terms\r\nwith each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t madden me by\r\ntalking about it to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain said no more. They turned their faces toward Aldborough,\r\nand walked slowly back.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the houses night had overtaken them. Neither\r\nmoon nor stars were visible. A faint noiseless breeze blowing from the\r\nland had come with the darkness. Magdalen paused on the lonely public\r\nwalk to breathe the air more freely. After a while she turned her face\r\nfrom the breeze and looked out toward the sea. The immeasurable silence\r\nof the calm waters, lost in the black void of night, was awful. She\r\nstood looking into the darkness, as if its mystery had no secrets for\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94she advanced toward it slowly, as if it drew her by some hidden\r\nattraction into itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going down to the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her companion. \xe2\x80\x9cWait here,\r\nand I will come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lost sight of her in an instant; it was as if the night had\r\nswallowed her up. He listened, and counted her footsteps by the\r\ncrashing of them on the shingle in the deep stillness. They retreated\r\nslowly, further and further away into the night. Suddenly the sound of\r\nthem ceased. Had she paused on her course or had she reached one of the\r\nstrips of sand left bare by the ebbing tide?\r\n\r\nHe waited, and listened anxiously. The time passed, and no sound\r\nreached him. He still listened, with a growing distrust of the\r\ndarkness. Another moment, and there came a sound from the invisible\r\nshore. Far and faint from the beach below, a long cry moaned through\r\nthe silence. Then all was still once more.\r\n\r\nIn sudden alarm, he stepped forward to descend to the beach, and to\r\ncall to her. Before he could cross the path, footsteps rapidly\r\nadvancing caught his ear. He waited an instant, and the figure of a man\r\npassed quickly along the walk between him and the sea. It was too dark\r\nto discern anything of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face; it was only possible to see\r\nthat he was a tall man\xe2\x80\x94as tall as that officer in the merchant-service\r\nwhose name was Kirke.\r\n\r\nThe figure passed on northward, and was instantly lost to view. Captain\r\nWragge crossed the path, and, advancing a few steps down the beach,\r\nstopped and listened again. The crash of footsteps on the shingle\r\ncaught his ear once more. Slowly, as the sound had left him, that sound\r\nnow came back. He called, to guide her to him. She came on till he\r\ncould just see her\xe2\x80\x94a shadow ascending the shingly slope, and growing\r\nout of the blackness of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou alarmed me,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid something had\r\nhappened. I heard you cry out as if you were in pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cI _was_ in pain. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand mechanically swung something to and fro as she answered him.\r\nIt was the little white silk bag which she had always kept hidden in\r\nher bosom up to this time. One of the relics which it held\xe2\x80\x94one of the\r\nrelics which she had not had the heart to part with before\xe2\x80\x94was gone\r\nfrom its keeping forever. Alone, on a strange shore, she had torn from\r\nher the fondest of her virgin memories, the dearest of her virgin\r\nhopes. Alone, on a strange shore, she had taken the lock of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair from its once-treasured place, and had cast it away from her to\r\nthe sea and the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe tall man who had passed Captain Wragge in the dark proceeded\r\nrapidly along the public walk, struck off across a little waste patch\r\nof ground, and entered the open door of the Aldborough Hotel. The light\r\nin the passage, falling full on his face as he passed it, proved the\r\ntruth of Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s surmise, and showed the stranger to be Mr.\r\nKirke, of the merchant service.\r\n\r\nMeeting the landlord in the passage, Mr. Kirke nodded to him with the\r\nfamiliarity of an old customer. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the paper?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to look at the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 list.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got it in my room, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, leading the way\r\ninto a parlor at the back of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cAre there any friends of yours\r\nstaying here, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout replying, the seaman turned to the list as soon as the\r\nnewspaper was placed in his hand, and ran his finger down it, name by\r\nname. The finger suddenly stopped at this line: \xe2\x80\x9cSea-view Cottage; Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d Kirke of the merchant-service repeated the name to\r\nhimself, and put down the paper thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you found anybody you know, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found a name I know\xe2\x80\x94a name my father used often to speak of in\r\nhis time. Is this Mr. Vanstone a family man? Do you know if there is a\r\nyoung lady in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say, captain. My wife will be here directly; she is sure to\r\nknow. It must have been some time ago, if your father knew this Mr.\r\nVanstone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_ some time ago. My father knew a subaltern officer of that\r\nname when he was with his regiment in Canada. It would be curious if\r\nthe person here turned out to be the same man, and if that young lady\r\nwas his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, captain\xe2\x80\x94but the young lady seems to hang a little on your\r\nmind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\nMr. Kirke looked as if the form which his host\xe2\x80\x99s good-humor had just\r\ntaken was not quite to his mind. He returned abruptly to the subaltern\r\nofficer and the regiment in Canada. \xe2\x80\x9cThat poor fellow\xe2\x80\x99s story was as\r\nmiserable a one as ever I heard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking back again absently\r\nat the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 list.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould there be any harm in telling it, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the landlord.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiserable or not, a story\xe2\x80\x99s a story, when you know it to be true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kirke hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly think I should be doing right to tell\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this man, or any relations of his, are still alive,\r\nit is not a story they might like strangers to know. All I can tell you\r\nis, that my father was the salvation of that young officer under very\r\ndreadful circumstances. They parted in Canada. My father remained with\r\nhis regiment; the young officer sold out and returned to England, and\r\nfrom that moment they lost sight of each other. It would be curious if\r\nthis Vanstone here was the same man. It would be curious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe suddenly checked himself just as another reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthe young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x9d was on the point of passing his lips. At the same moment the\r\nlandlord\xe2\x80\x99s wife came in, and Mr. Kirke at once transferred his\r\ninquiries to the higher authority in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything of this Mr. Vanstone who is down here on the\r\nvisitors\xe2\x80\x99 list?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he an old man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a miserable little creature to look at,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the landlady;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s not old, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he\xe2\x80\x99s not the man I mean. Perhaps he is the man\xe2\x80\x99s son? Has he got\r\nany ladies with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady tossed her head, and pursed up her lips disparagingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a housekeeper with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cA middle-aged person\xe2\x80\x94not\r\none of my sort. I dare say I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like a dressy woman in\r\nher station of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kirke began to look puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cI must have made some mistake about\r\nthe house,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely there\xe2\x80\x99s a lawn cut octagon-shape at\r\nSea-view Cottage, and a white flag-staff in the middle of the\r\ngravel-walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not Sea-view, sir! It\xe2\x80\x99s North Shingles you\xe2\x80\x99re talking of. Mr.\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x99s. His wife and his niece came here by the coach to-day. His\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s tall enough to be put in a show, and the worst-dressed woman I\r\never set eyes on. But Miss Bygrave is worth looking at, if I may\r\nventure to say so. She\xe2\x80\x99s the finest girl, to my mind, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had at\r\nAldborough for many a long day. I wonder who they are! Do you know the\r\nname, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Kirke, with a shade of disappointment on his dark,\r\nweather-beaten face; \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard the name before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter replying in those words, he rose to take his leave. The landlord\r\nvainly invited him to drink a parting glass; the landlady vainly\r\npressed him to stay another ten minutes and try a cup of tea. He only\r\nreplied that his sister expected him, and that he must return to the\r\nparsonage immediately.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the hotel Mr. Kirke set his face westward, and walked inland\r\nalong the highroad as fast as the darkness would let him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBygrave?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I know her name, how much am I\r\nthe wiser for it! If it had been Vanstone, my father\xe2\x80\x99s son might have\r\nhad a chance of making acquaintance with her.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and looked\r\nback in the direction of Aldborough. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool I am!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out\r\nsuddenly, striking his stick on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cI was forty last\r\nbirthday.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned and went on again faster than ever\xe2\x80\x94his head down;\r\nhis resolute black eyes searching the darkness on the land as they had\r\nsearched it many a time on the sea from the deck of his ship.\r\n\r\nAfter more than an hour\xe2\x80\x99s walking he reached a village, with a\r\nprimitive little church and parsonage nestled together in a hollow. He\r\nentered the house by the back way, and found his sister, the\r\nclergyman\xe2\x80\x99s wife, sitting alone over her work in the parlor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your husband, Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, taking a chair in a corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam has gone out to see a sick person. He had just time enough\r\nbefore he went,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell me about the young\r\nlady; and he declares he will never trust himself at Aldborough with\r\nyou again until you are a steady, married man.\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, and looked\r\nat her brother more attentively than she had looked at him yet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobert!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laying aside her work, and suddenly crossing the\r\nroom to him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look anxious, you look distressed. William only\r\nlaughed about your meeting with the young lady. Is it serious? Tell me;\r\nwhat is she like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his head away at the question.\r\n\r\nShe took a stool at his feet, and persisted in looking up at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit serious, Robert?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, softly.\r\n\r\nKirke\xe2\x80\x99s weather-beaten face was accustomed to no concealments\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nanswered for him before he spoke a word. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell your husband till\r\nI am gone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a roughness quite new in his sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexperience of him. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I only deserve to be laughed at; but it\r\nhurts me, for all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurts you?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t think me half such a fool, Lizzie, as I think myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npursued Kirke, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cA man at my age ought to know better. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t set eyes on her for as much as a minute altogether; and there I\r\nhave been hanging about the place till after nightfall on the chance of\r\nseeing her again\xe2\x80\x94skulking, I should have called it, if I had found one\r\nof my men doing what I have been doing myself. I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m bewitched.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s a mere girl, Lizzie\xe2\x80\x94I doubt if she\xe2\x80\x99s out of her teens\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m old\r\nenough to be her father. It\xe2\x80\x99s all one; she stops in my mind in spite of\r\nme. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had her face looking at me, through the pitch darkness, every\r\nstep of the way to this house; and it\xe2\x80\x99s looking at me now\xe2\x80\x94as plain as I\r\nsee yours, and plainer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose impatiently, and began to walk backward and forward in the\r\nroom. His sister looked after him, with surprise as well as sympathy\r\nexpressed in her face. From his boyhood upward she had always been\r\naccustomed to see him master of himself. Years since, in the failing\r\nfortunes of the family, he had been their example and their support.\r\nShe had heard of him in the desperate emergencies of a life at sea,\r\nwhen hundreds of his fellow-creatures had looked to his steady\r\nself-possession for rescue from close-threatening death\xe2\x80\x94and had not\r\nlooked in vain. Never, in all her life before, had his sister seen the\r\nbalance of that calm and equal mind lost as she saw it lost now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you talk so unreasonably about your age and yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is not a woman alive, Robert, who is good enough for you.\r\nWhat is her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBygrave. Do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But I might soon make acquaintance with her. If we only had a\r\nlittle time before us; if I could only get to Aldborough and see\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94but you are going away to-morrow; your ship sails at the end of the\r\nweek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God for that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirke, fervently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you glad to be going away?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, more and more amazed at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight glad, Lizzie, for my own sake. If I ever get to my senses again,\r\nI shall find my way back to them on the deck of my ship. This girl has\r\ngot between me and my thoughts already: she shan\xe2\x80\x99t go a step further,\r\nand get between me and my duty. I\xe2\x80\x99m determined on that. Fool as I am, I\r\nhave sense enough left not to trust myself within easy hail of\r\nAldborough to-morrow morning. I\xe2\x80\x99m good for another twenty miles of\r\nwalking, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin my journey back tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister started up, and caught him fast by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cRobert!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not serious? You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to leave us on foot,\r\nalone in the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only saying good-by, my dear, the last thing at night instead of\r\nthe first thing in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cTry and\r\nmake allowances for me, Lizzie. My life has been passed at sea; and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot used to having my mind upset in this way. Men ashore are used to\r\nit; men ashore can take it easy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t. If I stopped here I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrest. If I waited till to-morrow, I should only be going back to have\r\nanother look at her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to feel more ashamed of myself than I\r\ndo already. I want to fight my way back to my duty and myself, without\r\nstopping to think twice about it. Darkness is nothing to me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m used to\r\ndarkness. I have got the high-road to walk on, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t lose my way.\r\nLet me go, Lizzie! The only sweetheart I have any business with at my\r\nage is my ship. Let me get back to her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister still kept her hold of his arm, and still pleaded with him\r\nto stay till the morning. He listened to her with perfect patience and\r\nkindness, but she never shook his determination for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to say to William?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will he think when he\r\ncomes back and finds you gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I have taken the advice he gave us in his sermon last Sunday.\r\nSay I have turned my back on the world, the flesh, and the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you talk so, Robert! And the boys, too\xe2\x80\x94you promised not to go\r\nwithout bidding the boys good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true. I made my little nephews a promise, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nkicked off his shoes as he spoke, on the mat outside the door. \xe2\x80\x9cLight\r\nme upstairs, Lizzie; I\xe2\x80\x99ll bid the two boys good-by without waking\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw the uselessness of resisting him any longer; and, taking the\r\ncandle, went before him upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe boys\xe2\x80\x94both young children\xe2\x80\x94were sleeping together in the same bed.\r\nThe youngest was his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s favorite, and was called by his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname. He lay peacefully asleep, with a rough little toy ship hugged\r\nfast in his arms. Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s eyes softened as he stole on tiptoe to the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s side, and kissed him with the gentleness of a woman. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nlittle man!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is as fond of his ship as I\r\nwas at his age. I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut him out a better one when I come back. Will\r\nyou give me my nephew one of these days, Lizzie, and will you let me\r\nmake a sailor of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Robert, if you were only married and happy, as I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has gone by, my dear. I must make the best of it as I am,\r\nwith my little nephew there to help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the room. His sister\xe2\x80\x99s tears fell fast as she followed him into\r\nthe parlor. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something so forlorn and dreadful in your leaving\r\nus like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I go to Aldborough to-morrow, Robert,\r\nand try if I can get acquainted with her for your sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cLet her be. If it\xe2\x80\x99s ordered that I am to see that\r\ngirl again, I _shall_ see her. Leave it to the future, and you leave it\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d He put on his shoes, and took up his hat and stick. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\noverwalk myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the coach doesn\xe2\x80\x99t overtake\r\nme on the road, I can wait for it where I stop to breakfast. Dry your\r\neyes, my dear, and give me a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was like her brother in features and complexion, and she had a\r\ntouch of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s spirit; she dashed away the tears, and took her\r\nleave of him bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be back in a year\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirke, falling into his old\r\nsailor-like way at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you a China shawl, Lizzie, and\r\na chest of tea for your store-room. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let the boys forget me, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m doing wrong to leave you in this way. I know I am doing\r\nright. God bless you and keep you, my dear\xe2\x80\x94and your husband, and your\r\nchildren! Good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her. She ran to the door to look after him. A\r\npuff of air extinguished the candle, and the black night shut him out\r\nfrom her in an instant.\r\n\r\nThree days afterward the first-class merchantman _Deliverance_, Kirke,\r\ncommander, sailed from London for the China Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe threatening of storm and change passed away with the night. When\r\nmorning rose over Aldborough, the sun was master in the blue heaven,\r\nand the waves were rippling gayly under the summer breeze.\r\n\r\nAt an hour when no other visitors to the watering\xe2\x80\x94place were yet astir,\r\nthe indefatigable Wragge appeared at the door of North Shingles Villa,\r\nand directed his steps northward, with a neatly-bound copy of \xe2\x80\x9cJoyce\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nScientific Dialogues\xe2\x80\x9d in his hand. Arriving at the waste ground beyond\r\nthe houses, he descended to the beach and opened his book. The\r\ninterview of the past night had sharpened his perception of the\r\ndifficulties to be encountered in the coming enterprise. He was now\r\ndoubly determined to try the characteristic experiment at which he had\r\nhinted in his letter to Magdalen, and to concentrate on himself\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\ncharacter of a remarkably well-informed man\xe2\x80\x94the entire interest and\r\nattention of the formidable Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nHaving taken his dose of ready-made science (to use his own expression)\r\nthe first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, Captain Wragge\r\njoined his small family circle at breakfast-time, inflated with\r\ninformation for the day. He observed that Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s face showed plain\r\nsigns of a sleepless night. She made no complaint: her manner was\r\ncomposed, and her temper perfectly under control. Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x94refreshed\r\nby some thirteen consecutive hours of uninterrupted repose\xe2\x80\x94was in\r\nexcellent spirits, and up at heel (for a wonder) with both shoes. She\r\nbrought with her into the room several large sheets of tissue-paper,\r\ncut crisply into mysterious and many-varying forms, which immediately\r\nprovoked from her husband the short and sharp question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you\r\ngot there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatterns, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, in timidly conciliating tones.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went shopping in London, and bought an Oriental Cashmere Robe. It\r\ncost a deal of money; and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try and save, by making it\r\nmyself. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my patterns, and my dress-making directions written\r\nout as plain as print. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be very tidy, captain; I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep in my own\r\ncorner, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll please to give me one; and whether my head Buzzes, or\r\nwhether it don\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit straight at my work all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do your work,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you know who\r\nyou are, who I am, and who that young lady is\xe2\x80\x94not before. Show me your\r\nshoes! Good. Show me you cap! Good. Make the breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over, Mrs. Wragge received her orders to retire into\r\nan adjoining room, and to wait there until her husband came to release\r\nher. As soon as her back was turned, Captain Wragge at once resumed the\r\nconversation which had been suspended, by Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s own desire, on the\r\npreceding night. The questions he now put to her all related to the\r\nsubject of her visit in disguise to Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s house. They were\r\nthe questions of a thoroughly clear-headed man\xe2\x80\x94short, searching, and\r\nstraight to the point. In less than half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time he had made\r\nhimself acquainted with every incident that had happened in Vauxhall\r\nWalk.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions which the captain drew, after gaining his information,\r\nwere clear and easily stated.\r\n\r\nOn the adverse side of the question, he expressed his conviction that\r\nMrs. Lecount had certainly detected her visitor to be disguised; that\r\nshe had never really left the room, though she might have opened and\r\nshut the door; and that on both the occasions, therefore, when Magdalen\r\nhad been betrayed into speaking in her own voice, Mrs. Lecount had\r\nheard her. On the favorable side of the question, he was perfectly\r\nsatisfied that the painted face and eyelids, the wig, and the padded\r\ncloak had so effectually concealed Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s identity, that she might\r\nin her own person defy the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s closest scrutiny, so far as\r\nthe matter of appearance was concerned. The difficulty of deceiving\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s ears, as well as her eyes, was, he readily admitted, not\r\nso easily to be disposed of. But looking to the fact that Magdalen, on\r\nboth the occasions when she had forgotten herself, had spoken in the\r\nheat of anger, he was of opinion that her voice had every reasonable\r\nchance of escaping detection, if she carefully avoided all outbursts of\r\ntemper for the future, and spoke in those more composed and ordinary\r\ntones which Mrs. Lecount had not yet heard. Upon the whole, the captain\r\nwas inclined to pronounce the prospect hopeful, if one serious obstacle\r\nwere cleared away at the outset\xe2\x80\x94that obstacle being nothing less than\r\nthe presence on the scene of action of Mrs. Wragge.\r\n\r\nTo Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, when the course of her narrative brought her to\r\nthe story of the ghost, Captain Wragge listened with the air of a man\r\nwho was more annoyed than amused by what he heard. When she had done,\r\nhe plainly told her that her unlucky meeting on the stairs of the\r\nlodging-house with Mrs. Wragge was, in his opinion, the most serious of\r\nall the accidents that had happened in Vauxhall Walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can deal with the difficulty of my wife\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas I\r\nhave often dealt with it before. I can hammer her new identity _into_\r\nher head, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t hammer the ghost _out_ of it. We have no security\r\nthat the woman in the gray cloak and poke bonnet may not come back to\r\nher recollection at the most critical time, and under the most awkward\r\ncircumstances. In plain English, my dear girl, Mrs. Wragge is a pitfall\r\nunder our feet at every step we take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we are aware of the pitfall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can take our\r\nmeasures for avoiding it. What do you propose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI propose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthe temporary removal of Mrs.\r\nWragge. Speaking purely in a pecuniary point of view, I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a\r\ntotal separation from her. You have often read of very poor people\r\nbeing suddenly enriched by legacies reaching them from remote and\r\nunexpected quarters? Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s case, when I married her, was one of\r\nthese. An elderly female relative shared the favors of fortune on that\r\noccasion with my wife; and if I only keep up domestic appearances, I\r\nhappen to know that Mrs. Wragge will prove a second time profitable to\r\nme on that elderly relative\xe2\x80\x99s death. But for this circumstance, I\r\nshould probably long since have transferred my wife to the care of\r\nsociety at large\xe2\x80\x94in the agreeable conviction that if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t support\r\nher, somebody else would. Although I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to take this course,\r\nI see no objection to having her comfortably boarded and lodged out of\r\nour way for the time being\xe2\x80\x94say, at a retired farm-house, in the\r\ncharacter of a lady in infirm mental health. _You_ would find the\r\nexpense trifling; _I_ should find the relief unutterable. What do you\r\nsay? Shall I pack her up at once, and take her away by the next coach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor creature\xe2\x80\x99s life is hard\r\nenough already; I won\xe2\x80\x99t help to make it harder. She was affectionately\r\nand truly kind to me when I was ill, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow her to be shut\r\nup among strangers while I can help it. The risk of keeping her here is\r\nonly one risk more. I will face it, Captain Wragge, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink twice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you decide on keeping\r\nMrs. Wragge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have her sent away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI never interfere with\r\nquestions of sentiment. But I have a word to say on my own behalf. If\r\nmy services are to be of any use to you, I can\xe2\x80\x99t have my hands tied at\r\nstarting. This is serious. I won\xe2\x80\x99t trust my wife and Mrs. Lecount\r\ntogether. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not, and I make it a condition that, if\r\nMrs. Wragge stops here, she keeps her room. If you think her health\r\nrequires it, you can take her for a walk early in the morning, or late\r\nin the evening; but you must never trust her out with the servant, and\r\nnever trust her out by herself. I put the matter plainly, it is too\r\nimportant to be trifled with. What do you say\xe2\x80\x94yes or no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the\r\nunderstanding that I am to take her out walking, as you propose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge bowed, and recovered his suavity of manner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are\r\nour plans?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we start our enterprise this afternoon?\r\nAre you ready for your introduction to Mrs. Lecount and her master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood again. We will meet them on the Parade, at their usual hour for\r\ngoing out\xe2\x80\x94two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. It is not twelve yet. I have two hours before\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94just time enough to fit my wife into her new Skin. The process is\r\nabsolutely necessary, to prevent her compromising us with the servant.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid about the results; Mrs. Wragge has had a copious\r\nselection of assumed names hammered into her head in the course of her\r\nmatrimonial career. It is merely a question of hammering hard\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94nothing more. I think we have settled everything now. Is there\r\nanything I can do before two o\xe2\x80\x99clock? Have you any employment for the\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go back to my own room, and try to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had a disturbed night, I am afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, politely\r\nopening the door for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fell asleep once or twice,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose my\r\nnerves are a little shaken. The bold black eyes of that man who stared\r\nso rudely at me yesterday evening seemed to be looking at me again in\r\nmy dreams. If we see him to-day, and if he annoys me any more, I must\r\ntrouble you to speak to him. We will meet here again at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be hard with Mrs. Wragge; teach her what she must learn as\r\ntenderly as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words she left him, and went upstairs.\r\n\r\nShe lay down on her bed with a heavy sigh, and tried to sleep. It was\r\nuseless. The dull weariness of herself which now possessed her was not\r\nthe weariness which finds its remedy in repose. She rose again and sat\r\nby the window, looking out listlessly over the sea.\r\n\r\nA weaker nature than hers would not have felt the shock of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesertion as she had felt it\xe2\x80\x94as she was feeling it still. A weaker\r\nnature would have found refuge in indignation and comfort in tears. The\r\npassionate strength of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s love clung desperately to the sinking\r\nwreck of its own delusion-clung, until she tore herself from it, by\r\nplain force of will. All that her native pride, her keen sense of wrong\r\ncould do, was to shame her from dwelling on the thoughts which still\r\ncaught their breath of life from the undying devotion of the past;\r\nwhich still perversely ascribed Frank\xe2\x80\x99s heartless farewell to any cause\r\nbut the inborn baseness of the man who had written it. The woman never\r\nlived yet who could cast a true-love out of her heart because the\r\nobject of that love was unworthy of her. All she can do is to struggle\r\nagainst it in secret\xe2\x80\x94to sink in the contest if she is weak; to win her\r\nway through it if she is strong, by a process of self-laceration which\r\nis, of all moral remedies applied to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature, the most\r\ndangerous and the most desperate; of all moral changes, the change that\r\nis surest to mark her for life. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s strong nature had sustained\r\nher through the struggle; and the issue of it had left her what she now\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nAfter sitting by the window for nearly an hour, her eyes looking\r\nmechanically at the view, her mind empty of all impressions, and\r\nconscious of no thoughts, she shook off the strange waking stupor that\r\npossessed her, and rose to prepare herself for the serious business of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nShe went to the wardrobe and took down from the pegs two bright,\r\ndelicate muslin dresses, which had been made for summer wear at\r\nCombe-Raven a year since, and which had been of too little value to be\r\nworth selling when she parted with her other possessions. After placing\r\nthese dresses side by side on the bed, she looked into the wardrobe\r\nonce more. It only contained one other summer dress\xe2\x80\x94the plain alpaca\r\ngown which she had worn during her memorable interview with Noel\r\nVanstone and Mrs. Lecount. This she left in its place, resolving not to\r\nwear it\xe2\x80\x94less from any dread that the housekeeper might recognize a\r\npattern too quiet to be noticed, and too common to be remembered, than\r\nfrom the conviction that it was neither gay enough nor becoming enough\r\nfor her purpose. After taking a plain white muslin scarf, a pair of\r\nlight gray kid gloves, and a garden-hat of Tuscan straw, from the\r\ndrawers of the wardrobe, she locked it, and put the key carefully in\r\nher pocket.\r\n\r\nInstead of at once proceeding to dress herself, she sat idly looking at\r\nthe two muslin gowns; careless which she wore, and yet inconsistently\r\nhesitating which to choose. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself,\r\nwith a reckless laugh; \xe2\x80\x9cI am equally worthless in my own estimation,\r\nwhichever I put on.\xe2\x80\x9d She shuddered, as if the sound of her own laughter\r\nhad startled her, and abruptly caught up the dress which lay nearest to\r\nher hand. Its colors were blue and white\xe2\x80\x94the shade of blue which best\r\nsuited her fair complexion. She hurriedly put on the gown, without\r\ngoing near her looking-glass. For the first time in her life she shrank\r\nfrom meeting the reflection of herself\xe2\x80\x94except for a moment, when she\r\narranged her hair under her garden-hat, leaving the glass again\r\nimmediately. She drew her scarf over her shoulders and fitted on her\r\ngloves, with her back to the toilet-table. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I paint?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nherself, feeling instinctively that she was turning pale. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rouge is\r\nstill left in my box. It can\xe2\x80\x99t make my face more false than it is\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked round toward the glass, and again turned away from\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have Mrs. Lecount to face as well as her master.\r\nNo paint.\xe2\x80\x9d After consulting her watch, she left the room and went\r\ndownstairs again. It wanted ten minutes only of two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge was waiting for her in the parlor\xe2\x80\x94respectable, in a\r\nfrock-coat, a stiff summer cravat, and a high white hat; specklessly\r\nand cheerfully rural, in a buff waistcoat, gray trousers, and gaiters\r\nto match. His collars were higher than ever, and he carried a brand-new\r\ncamp-stool in his hand. Any tradesman in England who had seen him at\r\nthat moment would have trusted him on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, paternally surveying Magdalen when she\r\nentered the room. \xe2\x80\x9cSo fresh and cool! A little too pale, my dear, and a\r\ngreat deal too serious. Otherwise perfect. Try if you can smile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the time comes for smiling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9ctrust my\r\ndramatic training for any change of face that may be necessary. Where\r\nis Mrs. Wragge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wragge has learned her lesson,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand is\r\nrewarded by my permission to sit at work in her own room. I sanction\r\nher new fancy for dressmaking, because it is sure to absorb all her\r\nattention, and to keep her at home. There is no fear of her finishing\r\nthe Oriental Robe in a hurry, for there is no mistake in the process of\r\nmaking it which she is not certain to commit. She will sit incubating\r\nher gown\xe2\x80\x94pardon the expression\xe2\x80\x94like a hen over an addled egg. I assure\r\nyou, her new whim relieves me. Nothing could be more convenient, under\r\nexisting circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe strutted away to the window, looked out, and beckoned to Magdalen to\r\njoin him. \xe2\x80\x9cThere they are!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and pointed to the Parade.\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone slowly walked by, as she looked, dressed in a complete\r\nsuit of old-fashioned nankeen. It was apparently one of the days when\r\nthe state of his health was at the worst. He leaned on Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm, and was protected from the sun by a light umbrella which she held\r\nover him. The housekeeper\xe2\x80\x94dressed to perfection, as usual, in a quiet,\r\nlavender-colored summer gown, a black mantilla, an unassuming straw\r\nbonnet, and a crisp blue veil\xe2\x80\x94escorted her invalid master with the\r\ntenderest attention; sometimes directing his notice respectfully to the\r\nvarious objects of the sea view; sometimes bending her head in graceful\r\nacknowledgment of the courtesy of passing strangers on the Parade, who\r\nstepped aside to let the invalid pass by. She produced a visible effect\r\namong the idlers on the beach. They looked after her with unanimous\r\ninterest, and exchanged confidential nods of approval which said, as\r\nplainly as words could have expressed it, \xe2\x80\x9cA very domestic person! a\r\ntruly superior woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s party-colored eyes followed Mrs. Lecount with a\r\nsteady, distrustful attention. \xe2\x80\x9cTough work for us _there_,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s ear; \xe2\x80\x9ctougher work than you think, before we\r\nturn that woman out of her place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cWait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked to the door. The captain followed her without making any\r\nfurther remark. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait till you\xe2\x80\x99re married,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot a moment longer, offer me what you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the house door Magdalen addressed him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go that way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing southward, \xe2\x80\x9cthen turn, and\r\nmeet them as they come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge signified his approval of the arrangement, and followed\r\nMagdalen to the garden gate. As she opened it to pass through, her\r\nattention was attracted by a lady, with a nursery-maid and two little\r\nboys behind her, loitering on the path outside the garden wall. The\r\nlady started, looked eagerly, and smiled to herself as Magdalen came\r\nout. Curiosity had got the better of Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and she had come\r\nto Aldborough for the express purpose of seeing Miss Bygrave.\r\n\r\nSomething in the shape of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s face, something in the expression\r\nof her dark eyes, reminded Magdalen of the merchant-captain whose\r\nuncontrolled admiration had annoyed her on the previous evening. She\r\ninstantly returned the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s scrutiny by a frowning, ungracious\r\nlook. The lady colored, paid the look back with interest, and slowly\r\nwalked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hard, bold, bad girl,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s sister. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could Robert be\r\nthinking of to admire her? I am almost glad he is gone. I hope and\r\ntrust he will never set eyes on Miss Bygrave again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat boors the people are here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen to Captain Wragge.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman was even ruder than the man last night. She is like him in\r\nthe face. I wonder who she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll find out directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t be too cautious\r\nabout strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d He at once appealed to his friends, the boatmen. They\r\nwere close at hand, and Magdalen heard the questions and answers\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you all this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, in his easy\r\njocular way. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\xe2\x80\x99s the wind? Nor\xe2\x80\x99-west and by west, is it? Very\r\ngood. Who is that lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Strickland, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay! The clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s wife and the captain\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ncaptain to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn his way to London, I should think, sir. His ship sails for China at\r\nthe end of the week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChina! As that one word passed the man\xe2\x80\x99s lips, a pang of the old sorrow\r\nstruck Magdalen to the heart. Stranger as he was, she began to hate the\r\nbare mention of the merchant-captain\xe2\x80\x99s name. He had troubled her dreams\r\nof the past night; and now, when she was most desperately and\r\nrecklessly bent on forgetting her old home-existence, he had been\r\nindirectly the cause of recalling her mind to Frank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, angrily, to her companion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we care about the\r\nman or his ship? Come away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as we don\xe2\x80\x99t find friends\r\nof the Bygraves, what do we care about anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked on southward for ten minutes or more, then turned and\r\nwalked back again to meet Noel Vanstone and Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge and Magdalen retraced their steps until they were again\r\nwithin view of North Shingles Villa before any signs appeared of Mrs.\r\nLecount and her master. At that point the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlavender-colored dress, the umbrella, and the feeble little figure in\r\nnankeen walking under it, became visible in the distance. The captain\r\nslackened his pace immediately, and issued his directions to Magdalen\r\nfor her conduct at the coming interview in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget your smile,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all other respects you will do.\r\nThe walk has improved your complexion, and the hat becomes you. Look\r\nMrs. Lecount steadily in the face; show no embarrassment when you\r\nspeak; and if Mr. Noel Vanstone pays you pointed attention, don\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\ntoo much notice of him while his housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s eye is on you. Mind one\r\nthing! I have been at Joyce\xe2\x80\x99s Scientific Dialogues all the morning; and\r\nI am quite serious in meaning to give Mrs. Lecount the full benefit of\r\nmy studies. If I can\xe2\x80\x99t contrive to divert her attention from you and\r\nher master, I won\xe2\x80\x99t give sixpence for our chance of success. Small-talk\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t succeed with that woman; compliments won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed; jokes won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsucceed\xe2\x80\x94ready-made science may recall the deceased professor, and\r\nready-made science may do. We must establish a code of signals to let\r\nyou know what I am about. Observe this camp-stool. When I shift it from\r\nmy left hand to my right, I am talking Joyce. When I shift it from my\r\nright hand to my left, I am talking Wragge. In the first case, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninterrupt me\xe2\x80\x94I am leading up to my point. In the second case, say\r\nanything you like; my remarks are not of the slightest consequence.\r\nWould you like a rehearsal? Are you sure you understand? Very good\xe2\x80\x94take\r\nmy arm, and look happy. Steady! here they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe meeting took place nearly midway between Sea-view Cottage and North\r\nShingles. Captain Wragge took off his tall white hat and opened the\r\ninterview immediately on the friendliest terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Mrs. Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the frank and cheerful\r\npoliteness of a naturally sociable man. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Mr. Vanstone; I\r\nam sorry to see you suffering to-day. Mrs. Lecount, permit me to\r\nintroduce my niece\xe2\x80\x94my niece, Miss Bygrave. My dear girl, this is Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone, our neighbor at Sea-view Cottage. We must positively be\r\nsociable at Aldborough, Mrs. Lecount. There is only one walk in the\r\nplace (as my niece remarked to me just now, Mr. Vanstone); and on that\r\nwalk we must all meet every time we go out. And why not? Are we formal\r\npeople on either side? Nothing of the sort; we are just the reverse.\r\nYou possess the Continental facility of manner, Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94I match\r\nyou with the blunt cordiality of an old-fashioned Englishman\xe2\x80\x94the ladies\r\nmingle together in harmonious variety, like flowers on the same bed\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe result is a mutual interest in making our sojourn at the sea-side\r\nagreeable to each other. Pardon my flow of spirits; pardon my feeling\r\nso cheerful and so young. The Iodine in the sea-air, Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnotorious effect of the Iodine in the sea-air!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou arrived yesterday, Miss Bygrave, did you not?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nhousekeeper, as soon as the captain\xe2\x80\x99s deluge of language had come to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nShe addressed those words to Magdalen with a gentle motherly interest\r\nin her youth and beauty, chastened by the deferential amiability which\r\nbecame her situation in Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s household. Not the faintest\r\ntoken of suspicion or surprise betrayed itself in her face, her voice,\r\nor her manner, while she and Magdalen now looked at each other. It was\r\nplain at the outset that the true face and figure which she now saw\r\nrecalled nothing to her mind of the false face and figure which she had\r\nseen in Vauxhall Walk. The disguise had evidently been complete enough\r\neven to baffle the penetration of Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt and I came here yesterday evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe found\r\nthe latter part of the journey very fatiguing. I dare say you found it\r\nso, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe designedly made her answer longer than was necessary for the\r\npurpose of discovering, at the earliest opportunity, the effect which\r\nthe sound of her voice produced on Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s thin lips maintained their motherly smile; the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s amiable manner lost none of its modest deference, but the\r\nexpression of her eyes suddenly changed from a look of attention to a\r\nlook of inquiry. Magdalen quietly said a few words more, and then\r\nwaited again for results. The change spread gradually all over Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s face, the motherly smile died away, and the amiable manner\r\nbetrayed a slight touch of restraint. Still no signs of positive\r\nrecognition appeared; the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s expression remained what it had\r\nbeen from the first\xe2\x80\x94an expression of inquiry, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou complained of fatigue, sir, a few minutes since,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ndropping all further conversation with Magdalen and addressing her\r\nmaster. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you go indoors and rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of Sea-view Cottage had hitherto confined himself to\r\nbowing, simpering and admiring Magdalen through his half-closed\r\neyelids. There was no mistaking the sudden flutter and agitation in his\r\nmanner, and the heightened color in his wizen little face. Even the\r\nreptile temperament of Noel Vanstone warmed under the influence of the\r\nsex: he had an undeniably appreciative eye for a handsome woman, and\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s grace and beauty were not thrown away on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go indoors, sir, and rest?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the housekeeper, repeating\r\nher quest ion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d said her master. \xe2\x80\x9cI fancy I feel stronger; I fancy\r\nI can go on a little.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned simpering to Magdalen, and added, in a\r\nlower tone: \xe2\x80\x9cI have found a new interest in my walk, Miss Bygrave.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t desert us, or you will take the interest away with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled and smirked in the highest approval of the ingenuity of his\r\nown compliment\xe2\x80\x94from which Captain Wragge dexterously diverted the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s attention by ranging himself on her side of the path and\r\nspeaking to her at the same moment. They all four walked on slowly.\r\nMrs. Lecount said nothing more. She kept fast hold of her master\xe2\x80\x99s arm,\r\nand looked across him at Magdalen with the dangerous expression of\r\ninquiry more marked than ever in her handsome black eyes. That look was\r\nnot lost on the wary Wragge. He shifted his indicative camp-stool from\r\nthe left hand to the right, and opened his scientific batteries on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA busy scene, Mrs. Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, politely waving his\r\ncamp-stool over the sea and the passing ships. \xe2\x80\x9cThe greatness of\r\nEngland, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94the true greatness of England. Pray observe how heavily\r\nsome of those vessels are laden! I am often inclined to wonder whether\r\nthe British sailor is at all aware, when he has got his cargo on board,\r\nof the Hydrostatic importance of the operation that he has performed.\r\nIf I were suddenly transported to the deck of one of those ships (which\r\nHeaven forbid, for I suffer at sea); and if I said to a member of the\r\ncrew: \xe2\x80\x98Jack! you have done wonders; you have grasped the Theory of\r\nFloating Vessels\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94how the gallant fellow would stare! And yet on that\r\ntheory Jack\xe2\x80\x99s life depends. If he loads his vessel one-thirtieth part\r\nmore than he ought, what happens? He sails past Aldborough, I grant\r\nyou, in safety. He enters the Thames, I grant you again, in safety. He\r\ngets on into the fresh water as far, let us say, as Greenwich; and\xe2\x80\x94down\r\nhe goes! Down, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to the bottom of the river, as a matter of\r\nscientific certainty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he paused, and left Mrs. Lecount no polite alternative but to\r\nrequest an explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith infinite pleasure, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, drowning in the\r\ndeepest notes of his voice the feeble treble in which Noel Vanstone\r\npaid his compliments to Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will start, if you please, with a\r\nfirst principle. All bodies whatever that float on the surface of the\r\nwater displace as much fluid as is equal in weight to the weight of the\r\nbodies. Good. We have got our first principle. What do we deduce from\r\nit? Manifestly this: That, in order to keep a vessel above water, it is\r\nnecessary to take care that the vessel and its cargo shall be of less\r\nweight than the weight of a quantity of water\xe2\x80\x94pray follow me here!\xe2\x80\x94of a\r\nquantity of water equal in bulk to that part of the vessel which it\r\nwill be safe to immerse in the water. Now, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, salt-water is\r\nspecifically thirty times heavier than fresh or river water, and a\r\nvessel in the German Ocean will not sink so deep as a vessel in the\r\nThames. Consequently, when we load our ship with a view to the London\r\nmarket, we have (Hydrostatically speaking) three alternatives. Either\r\nwe load with one-thirtieth part less than we can carry at sea; or we\r\ntake one-thirtieth part out at the mouth of the river; or we do neither\r\nthe one nor the other, and, as I have already had the honor of\r\nremarking\xe2\x80\x94down we go! Such,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, shifting the camp-stool\r\nback again from his right hand to his left, in token that Joyce was\r\ndone with for the time being; \xe2\x80\x9csuch, my dear madam, is the Theory of\r\nFloating Vessels. Permit me to add, in conclusion, you are heartily\r\nwelcome to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have unintentionally saddened\r\nme; but the information I have received is not the less precious on\r\nthat account. It is long, long ago, Mr. Bygrave, since I have heard\r\nmyself addressed in the language of science. My dear husband made me\r\nhis companion\xe2\x80\x94my dear husband improved my mind as you have been trying\r\nto improve it. Nobody has taken pains with my intellect since. Many\r\nthanks, sir. Your kind consideration for me is not thrown away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed with a plaintive humility, and privately opened her ears to\r\nthe conversation on the other side of her.\r\n\r\nA minute earlier she would have heard her master expressing himself in\r\nthe most flattering terms on the subject of Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s appearance\r\nin her sea-side costume. But Magdalen had seen Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s signal\r\nwith the camp-stool, and had at once diverted Noel Vanstone to the\r\ntopic of himself and his possessions by a neatly-timed question about\r\nhis house at Aldborough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to alarm you, Miss Bygrave,\xe2\x80\x9d were the first words of Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s which caught Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s attention, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is only\r\none safe house in Aldborough, and that house is mine. The sea may\r\ndestroy all the other houses\xe2\x80\x94it can\xe2\x80\x99t destroy Mine. My father took care\r\nof that; my father was a remarkable man. He had My house built on\r\npiles. I have reason to believe they are the strongest piles in\r\nEngland. Nothing can possibly knock them down\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what the sea\r\ndoes\xe2\x80\x94nothing can possibly knock them down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if the sea invades us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must all run for\r\nrefuge to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone saw his way to another compliment; and, at the same\r\nmoment, the wary captain saw his way to another burst of science.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could almost wish the invasion might happen,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured one of the\r\ngentlemen, \xe2\x80\x9cto give me the happiness of offering the refuge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could almost swear the wind had shifted again!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is a man I can ask? Oh, there he is. Boatman! How\xe2\x80\x99s the wind\r\nnow? Nor\xe2\x80\x99west and by west still\xe2\x80\x94hey? And southeast and by south\r\nyesterday evening\xe2\x80\x94ha? Is there anything more remarkable, Mrs. Lecount,\r\nthan the variableness of the wind in this climate?\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the\r\ncaptain, shifting the camp-stool to the scientific side of him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthere any natural phenomenon more bewildering to the scientific\r\ninquirer? You will tell me that the electric fluid which abounds in the\r\nair is the principal cause of this variableness. You will remind me of\r\nthe experiment of that illustrious philosopher who measured the\r\nvelocity of a great storm by a flight of small feathers. My dear madam,\r\nI grant all your propositions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount; \xe2\x80\x9cyou kindly attribute to\r\nme a knowledge that I don\xe2\x80\x99t possess. Propositions, I regret to say, are\r\nquite beyond me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain, politely\r\nunconscious of the interruption. \xe2\x80\x9cMy remarks apply to the temperate\r\nzone only. Place me on the coasts beyond the tropics\xe2\x80\x94place me where the\r\nwind blows toward the shore in the day-time, and toward the sea by\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94and I instantly advance toward conclusive experiments. For\r\nexample, I know that the heat of the sun during the day rarefies the\r\nair over the land, and so causes the wind. You challenge me to prove\r\nit. I escort you down the kitchen stairs (with your kind permission);\r\ntake my largest pie-dish out of the cook\xe2\x80\x99s hands; I fill it with cold\r\nwater. Good! that dish of cold water represents the ocean. I next\r\nprovide myself with one of our most precious domestic conveniences, a\r\nhot-water plate; I fill it with hot water and I put it in the middle of\r\nthe pie-dish. Good again! the hot-water plate represents the land\r\nrarefying the air over it. Bear that in mind, and give me a lighted\r\ncandle. I hold my lighted candle over the cold water, and blow it out.\r\nThe smoke immediately moves from the dish to the plate. Before you have\r\ntime to express your satisfaction, I light the candle once more, and\r\nreverse the whole proceeding. I fill the pie-dish with hot-water, and\r\nthe plate with cold; I blow the candle out again, and the smoke moves\r\nthis time from the plate to the dish. The smell is disagreeable\xe2\x80\x94but the\r\nexperiment is conclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shifted the camp-stool back again, and looked at Mrs. Lecount with\r\nhis ingratiating smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t find me long-winded, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, in his easy, cheerful way, just as the housekeeper was\r\nprivately opening her ears once more to the conversation on the other\r\nside of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am amazed, sir, by the range of your information,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs.\r\nLecount, observing the captain with some perplexity\xe2\x80\x94but thus far with\r\nno distrust. She thought him eccentric, even for an Englishman, and\r\npossibly a little vain of his knowledge. But he had at least paid her\r\nthe implied compliment of addressing that knowledge to herself; and she\r\nfelt it the more sensibly, from having hitherto found her scientific\r\nsympathies with her deceased husband treated with no great respect by\r\nthe people with whom she came in contact. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you extended your\r\ninquiries, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded, after a momentary hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cto my\r\nlate husband\xe2\x80\x99s branch of science? I merely ask, Mr. Bygrave, because\r\n(though I am only a woman) I think I might exchange ideas with you on\r\nthe subject of the reptile creation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge was far too sharp to risk his ready-made science on the\r\nenemy\xe2\x80\x99s ground. The old militia-man shook his wary head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo vast a subject, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a smatterer like me. The\r\nlife and labors of such a philosopher as your husband, Mrs. Lecount,\r\nwarn men of my intellectual caliber not to measure themselves with a\r\ngiant. May I inquire,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the captain, softly smoothing the way\r\nfor future intercourse with Sea-view Cottage, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you possess any\r\nscientific memorials of the late Professor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI possess his Tank, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, modestly casting her eyes\r\non the ground, \xe2\x80\x9cand one of his Subjects\xe2\x80\x94a little foreign Toad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Tank!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the captain, in tones of mournful interest; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhis Toad! Pardon my blunt way of speaking my mind, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. You possess\r\nan object of public interest; and, as one of the public, I acknowledge\r\nmy curiosity to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s smooth cheeks colored with pleasure. The one assailable\r\nplace in that cold and secret nature was the place occupied by the\r\nmemory of the Professor. Her pride in his scientific achievements, and\r\nher mortification at finding them but little known out of his own\r\ncountry, were genuine feelings. Never had Captain Wragge burned his\r\nadulterated incense on the flimsy altar of human vanity to better\r\npurpose than he was burning it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cIn honoring my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemory, you honor me. But though you kindly treat me on a footing of\r\nequality, I must not forget that I fill a domestic situation. I shall\r\nfeel it a privilege to show you my relics, if you will allow me to ask\r\nmy master\xe2\x80\x99s permission first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to Noel Vanstone; her perfectly sincere intention of making\r\nthe proposed request, mingling\xe2\x80\x94in that strange complexity of motives\r\nwhich is found so much oftener in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s mind than in a man\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nher jealous distrust of the impression which Magdalen had produced on\r\nher master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I make a request, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount, after waiting a moment\r\nto catch any fragments of tenderly-personal talk that might reach her,\r\nand after being again neatly baffled by Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94thanks to the\r\ncamp-stool. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bygrave is one of the few persons in England who\r\nappreciate my husband\xe2\x80\x99s scientific labors. He honors me by wishing to\r\nsee my little world of reptiles. May I show it to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means, Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, graciously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are an\r\nexcellent creature, and I like to oblige you. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s Tank, Mr.\r\nBygrave, is the only Tank in England\xe2\x80\x94Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s Toad is the oldest Toad\r\nin the world. Will you come and drink tea at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-night?\r\nAnd will you prevail on Miss Bygrave to accompany you? I want her to\r\nsee my house. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she has any idea what a strong house it is.\r\nCome and survey my premises, Miss Bygrave. You shall have a stick and\r\nrap on the walls; you shall go upstairs and stamp on the floors, and\r\nthen you shall hear what it all cost.\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes wrinkled up cunningly\r\nat the corners, and he slipped another tender speech into Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\near, under cover of the all-predominating voice in which Captain Wragge\r\nthanked him for the invitation. \xe2\x80\x9cCome punctually at seven,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered, \xe2\x80\x9cand pray wear that charming hat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s lips closed ominously. She set down the captain\xe2\x80\x99s niece\r\nas a very serious drawback to the intellectual luxury of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are fatiguing yourself, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her master. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is one\r\nof your bad days. Let me recommend you to be careful; let me beg you to\r\nwalk back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving carried his point by inviting the new acquaintances to tea, Noel\r\nVanstone proved to be unexpectedly docile. He acknowledged that he was\r\na little fatigued, and turned back at once in obedience to the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my arm, sir\xe2\x80\x94take my arm on the other side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge,\r\nas they turned to retrace their steps. His party-colored eyes looked\r\nsignificantly at Magdalen while he spoke, and warned her not to stretch\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s endurance too far at starting. She instantly understood\r\nhim; and, in spite of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s reiterated assertions that he\r\nstood in no need of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s arm, placed herself at once by the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s side. Mrs. Lecount recovered her good-humor, and opened\r\nanother conversation with Magdalen by making the one inquiry of all\r\nothers which, under existing circumstances, was the hardest to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume Mrs. Bygrave is too tired, after her journey, to come out\r\nto-day?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we have the pleasure of seeing her\r\ntomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt is in delicate health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA complicated case, my dear madam,\xe2\x80\x9d added the captain; conscious that\r\nMrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s personal appearance (if she happened to be seen by\r\naccident) would offer the flattest of all possible contradictions to\r\nwhat Magdalen had just said of her. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is some remote nervous\r\nmischief which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t express itself externally. You would think my\r\nwife the picture of health if you looked at her, and yet, so delusive\r\nare appearances, I am obliged to forbid her all excitement. She sees no\r\nsociety\xe2\x80\x94our medical attendant, I regret to say, absolutely prohibits\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor lady must often feel lonely,\r\nsir, when you and your niece are away from her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bygrave is a naturally domestic woman.\r\nWhen she is able to employ herself, she finds unlimited resources in\r\nher needle and thread.\xe2\x80\x9d Having reached this stage of the explanation,\r\nand having purposely skirted, as it were, round the confines of truth,\r\nin the event of the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity leading her to make any\r\nprivate inquiries on the subject of Mrs. Wragge, the captain wisely\r\nchecked his fluent tongue from carrying him into any further details.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have great hope from the air of this place,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, in\r\nconclusion. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Iodine, as I have already observed, does wonders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount acknowledged the virtues of Iodine, in the briefest\r\npossible form of words, and withdrew into the innermost sanctuary of\r\nher own thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cSome mystery here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper to herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady who looks the picture of health; a lady who suffers from a\r\ncomplicated nervous malady; and a lady whose hand is steady enough to\r\nuse her needle and thread\xe2\x80\x94is a living mass of contradictions I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite understand. Do you make a long stay at Aldborough, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded aloud, her eyes resting for a moment, in steady scrutiny, on the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all depends, my dear madam, on Mrs. Bygrave. I trust we shall stay\r\nthrough the autumn. You are settled at Sea-view Cottage, I presume, for\r\nthe season?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must ask my master, sir. It is for him to decide, not for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer was an unfortunate one. Noel Vanstone had been secretly\r\nannoyed by the change in the walking arrangements, which had separated\r\nhim from Magdalen. He attributed that change to the meddling influence\r\nof Mrs. Lecount, and he now took the earliest opportunity of resenting\r\nit on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to do with our stay at Aldborough,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out,\r\npeevishly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know as well as I do, Lecount, it all depends on _you_.\r\nMrs. Lecount has a brother in Switzerland,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, addressing\r\nhimself to the captain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca brother who is seriously ill. If he gets\r\nworse, she will have to go there to see him. I can\xe2\x80\x99t accompany her, and\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t be left in the house by myself. I shall have to break up my\r\nestablishment at Aldborough, and stay with some friends. It all depends\r\non you, Lecount\xe2\x80\x94or on your brother, which comes to the same thing. If\r\nit depended on _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Noel Vanstone, looking pointedly at\r\nMagdalen across the housekeeper, \xe2\x80\x9cI should stay at Aldborough all\r\nthrough the autumn with the greatest pleasure. With the greatest\r\npleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d he reiterated, repeating the words with a tender look for\r\nMagdalen, and a spiteful accent for Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nThus far Captain Wragge had remained silent; carefully noting in his\r\nmind the promising possibilities of a separation between Mrs. Lecount\r\nand her master which Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s little fretful outbreak had just\r\ndisclosed to him. An ominous trembling in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s thin lips,\r\nas her master openly exposed her family affairs before strangers, and\r\nopenly set her jealously at defiance, now warned him to interfere. If\r\nthe misunderstanding were permitted to proceed to extremities, there\r\nwas a chance that the invitation for that evening to Sea-view Cottage\r\nmight be put off. Now, as ever, equal to the occasion, Captain Wragge\r\ncalled his useful information once more to the rescue. Under the\r\nlearned auspices of Joyce, he plunged, for the third time, into the\r\nocean of science, and brought up another pearl. He was still haranguing\r\n(on Pneumatics this time), still improving Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s mind with his\r\npolitest perseverance and his smoothest flow of language\xe2\x80\x94when the\r\nwalking party stopped at Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul, here we are at your house, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain,\r\ninterrupting himself in the middle of one of his graphic sentences. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t keep you standing a moment. Not a word of apology, Mrs. Lecount,\r\nI beg and pray! I will put that curious point in Pneumatics more\r\nclearly before you on a future occasion. In the meantime I need only\r\nrepeat that you can perform the experiment I have just mentioned to\r\nyour own entire satisfaction with a bladder, an exhausted receiver, and\r\na square box. At seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock this evening, sir\xe2\x80\x94at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mrs.\r\nLecount. We have had a remarkably pleasant walk, and a most instructive\r\ninterchange of ideas. Now, my dear girl, your aunt is waiting for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Lecount stepped aside to open the garden gate, Noel Vanstone\r\nseized his opportunity and shot a last tender glance at Magdalen, under\r\nshelter of the umbrella, which he had taken into his own hands for that\r\nexpress purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the sweetest smile;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t forget, when you come this evening, to wear that charming hat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBefore he could add any last words, Mrs. Lecount glided back to her\r\nplace, and the sheltering umbrella changed hands again immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn excellent morning\xe2\x80\x99s work!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, as he and Magdalen\r\nwalked on together to North Shingles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and I and Joyce have all\r\nthree done wonders. We have secured a friendly invitation at the first\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s fishing for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused for an answer; and, receiving none, observed Magdalen more\r\nattentively than he had observed her yet. Her face had turned deadly\r\npale again; her eyes looked out mechanically straight before her in\r\nheedless, reckless despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with the greatest surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply; she hardly seemed to hear him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you getting alarmed about Mrs. Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired next. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis not the least reason for alarm. She may fancy she has heard\r\nsomething like your voice before, but your face evidently bewilders\r\nher. Keep your temper, and you keep her in the dark. Keep her in the\r\ndark, and you will put that two hundred pounds into my hands before the\r\nautumn is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited again for an answer, and again she remained silent. The\r\ncaptain tried for the third time in another direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you get any letters this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there bad news\r\nagain from home? Any fresh difficulties with your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay nothing about my sister!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither you\r\nnor I are fit to speak of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said those words at the garden-gate, and hurried into the house by\r\nherself. He followed her, and heard the door of her own room violently\r\nshut to, violently locked and double-locked. Solacing his indignation\r\nby an oath, Captain Wragge sullenly went into one of the parlors on the\r\nground-floor to look after his wife. The room communicated with a\r\nsmaller and darker room at the back of the house by means of a quaint\r\nlittle door with a window in the upper half of it. Softly approaching\r\nthis door, the captain lifted the white muslin curtain which hung over\r\nthe window, and looked into the inner room.\r\n\r\nThere was Mrs. Wragge, with her cap on one side, and her shoes down at\r\nheel; with a row of pins between her teeth; with the Oriental Cashmere\r\nRobe slowly slipping off the table; with her scissors suspended\r\nuncertain in one hand, and her written directions for dressmaking held\r\ndoubtfully in the other\xe2\x80\x94so absorbed over the invincible difficulties of\r\nher employment as to be perfectly unconscious that she was at that\r\nmoment the object of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s superintending eye. Under other\r\ncircumstances she would have been soon brought to a sense of her\r\nsituation by the sound of his voice. But Captain Wragge was too anxious\r\nabout Magdalen to waste any time on his wife, after satisfying himself\r\nthat she was safe in her seclusion, and that she might be trusted to\r\nremain there.\r\n\r\nHe left the parlor, and, after a little hesitation in the passage,\r\nstole upstairs and listened anxiously outside Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s door. A dull\r\nsound of sobbing\xe2\x80\x94a sound stifled in her handkerchief, or stifled in the\r\nbed-clothes\xe2\x80\x94was all that caught his ear. He returned at once to the\r\nground-floor, with some faint suspicion of the truth dawning on his\r\nmind at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take that sweetheart of hers!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nNoel Vanstone has raised the ghost of him at starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWhen Magdalen appeared in the parlor shortly before seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, not\r\na trace of discomposure was visible in her manner. She looked and spoke\r\nas quietly and unconcernedly as usual.\r\n\r\nThe lowering distrust on Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s face cleared away at the\r\nsight of her. There had been moments during the afternoon when he had\r\nseriously doubted whether the pleasure of satisfying the grudge he owed\r\nto Noel Vanstone, and the prospect of earning the sum of two hundred\r\npounds, would not be dearly purchased by running the risk of discovery\r\nto which Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain temper might expose him at any hour of\r\nthe day. The plain proof now before him of her powers of self-control\r\nrelieved his mind of a serious anxiety. It mattered little to the\r\ncaptain what she suffered in the privacy of her own chamber, as long as\r\nshe came out of it with a face that would bear inspection, and a voice\r\nthat betrayed nothing.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Sea-view Cottage, Captain Wragge expressed his intention\r\nof asking the housekeeper a few sympathizing questions on the subject\r\nof her invalid brother in Switzerland. He was of opinion that the\r\ncritical condition of this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s health might exercise an\r\nimportant influence on the future progress of the conspiracy. Any\r\nchance of a separation, he remarked, between the housekeeper and her\r\nmaster was, under existing circumstances, a chance which merited the\r\nclosest investigation. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we can only get Mrs. Lecount out of the way\r\nat the right time,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the captain, as he opened his host\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarden gate, \xe2\x80\x9cour man is caught!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a minute more Magdalen was again under Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s roof; this\r\ntime in the character of his own invited guest.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the evening were for the most part a repetition of\r\nthe proceedings during the morning walk. Noel Vanstone vibrated between\r\nhis admiration of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s beauty and his glorification of his own\r\npossessions. Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s inexhaustible outbursts of\r\ninformation\xe2\x80\x94relieved by delicately-indirect inquiries relating to Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s brother\xe2\x80\x94perpetually diverted the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s jealous\r\nvigilance from dwelling on the looks and language of her master. So the\r\nevening passed until ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. By that time the captain\xe2\x80\x99s ready-made\r\nscience was exhausted, and the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s temper was forcing its way\r\nto the surface. Once more Captain Wragge warned Magdalen by a look,\r\nand, in spite of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s hospitable protest, wisely rose to say\r\ngood-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got my information,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the captain on the way back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s brother lives at Zurich. He is a bachelor; he possesses\r\na little money, and his sister is his nearest relation. If he will only\r\nbe so obliging as to break up altogether, he will save us a world of\r\ntrouble with Mrs. Lecount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a fine moonlight night. He looked round at Magdalen, as he said\r\nthose words, to see if her intractable depression of spirits had seized\r\non her again.\r\n\r\nNo! her variable humor had changed once more. She looked about her with\r\na flaunting, feverish gayety; she scoffed at the bare idea of any\r\nserious difficulty with Mrs. Lecount; she mimicked Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh-pitched voice, and repeated Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s high-flown\r\ncompliments, with a bitter enjoyment of turning him into ridicule.\r\nInstead of running into the house as before, she sauntered carelessly\r\nby her companion\xe2\x80\x99s side, humming little snatches of song, and kicking\r\nthe loose pebbles right and left on the garden-walk. Captain Wragge\r\nhailed the change in her as the best of good omens. He thought he saw\r\nplain signs that the family spirit was at last coming back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he lit her bedroom candle for her, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we all\r\nmeet on the Parade tomorrow, we shall see, as our nautical friends say,\r\nhow the land lies. One thing I can tell you, my dear girl\xe2\x80\x94I have used\r\nmy eyes to very little purpose if there is not a storm brewing tonight\r\nin Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s domestic atmosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s habitual penetration had not misled him. As soon as the\r\ndoor of Sea-view Cottage was closed on the parting guests, Mrs. Lecount\r\nmade an effort to assert the authority which Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s influence was\r\nthreatening already.\r\n\r\nShe employed every artifice of which she was mistress to ascertain\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s true position in Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s estimation. She tried again\r\nand again to lure him into an unconscious confession of the pleasure\r\nwhich he felt already in the society of the beautiful Miss Bygrave; she\r\ntwined herself in and out of every weakness in his character, as the\r\nfrogs and efts twined themselves in and out of the rock-work of her\r\nAquarium. But she made one serious mistake which very clever people in\r\ntheir intercourse with their intellectual inferiors are almost\r\nuniversally apt to commit\xe2\x80\x94she trusted implicitly to the folly of a\r\nfool. She forgot that one of the lowest of human qualities\xe2\x80\x94cunning\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nexactly the capacity which is often most largely developed in the\r\nlowest of intellectual natures. If she had been honestly angry with her\r\nmaster, she would probably have frightened him. If she had opened her\r\nmind plainly to his view, she would have astonished him by presenting a\r\nchain of ideas to his limited perceptions which they were not strong\r\nenough to grasp; his curiosity would have led him to ask for an\r\nexplanation; and by practicing on that curiosity, she might have had\r\nhim at her mercy. As it was, she set her cunning against his, and the\r\nfool proved a match for her. Noel Vanstone, to whom all large-minded\r\nmotives under heaven were inscrutable mysteries, saw the small-minded\r\nmotive at the bottom of his housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s conduct with as instantaneous\r\na penetration as if he had been a man of the highest ability. Mrs.\r\nLecount left him for the night, foiled, and knowing she was foiled\xe2\x80\x94left\r\nhim, with the tigerish side of her uppermost, and a low-lived longing\r\nin her elegant finger-nails to set them in her master\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nShe was not a woman to be beaten by one defeat or by a hundred. She was\r\npositively determined to think, and think again, until she had found a\r\nmeans of checking the growing intimacy with the Bygraves at once and\r\nforever. In the solitude of her own room she recovered her composure,\r\nand set herself for the first time to review the conclusions which she\r\nhad gathered from the events of the day.\r\n\r\nThere was something vaguely familiar to her in the voice of this Miss\r\nBygrave, and, at the same time, in unaccountable contradiction,\r\nsomething strange to her as well. The face and figure of the young lady\r\nwere entirely new to her. It was a striking face, and a striking\r\nfigure; and if she had seen either at any former period, she would\r\ncertainly have remembered it. Miss Bygrave was unquestionably a\r\nstranger; and yet\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nShe had got no further than this during the day; she could get no\r\nfurther now: the chain of thought broke. Her mind took up the\r\nfragments, and formed another chain which attached itself to the lady\r\nwho was kept in seclusion\xe2\x80\x94to the aunt, who looked well, and yet was\r\nnervous; who was nervous, and yet able to ply her needle and thread. An\r\nincomprehensible resemblance to some unremembered voice in the niece;\r\nan unintelligible malady which kept the aunt secluded from public view;\r\nan extraordinary range of scientific cultivation in the uncle,\r\nassociated with a coarseness and audacity of manner which by no means\r\nsuggested the idea of a man engaged in studious pursuits\xe2\x80\x94were the\r\nmembers of this small family of three what they seemed on the surface\r\nof them?\r\n\r\nWith that question on her mind, she went to bed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the candle was out, the darkness seemed to communicate some\r\ninexplicable perversity to her thoughts. They wandered back from\r\npresent things to past, in spite of her. They brought her old master\r\nback to life again; they revived forgotten sayings and doings in the\r\nEnglish circle at Zurich; they veered away to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s death-bed\r\nat Brighton; they moved from Brighton to London; they entered the bare,\r\ncomfortless room at Vauxhall Walk; they set the Aquarium back in its\r\nplace on the kitchen table, and put the false Miss Garth in the chair\r\nby the side of it, shading her inflamed eyes from the light; they\r\nplaced the anonymous letter, the letter which glanced darkly at a\r\nconspiracy, in her hand again, and brought her with it into her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s presence; they recalled the discussion about filling in the\r\nblank space in the advertisement, and the quarrel that followed when\r\nshe told Noel Vanstone that the sum he had offered was preposterously\r\nsmall; they revived an old doubt which had not troubled her for weeks\r\npast\xe2\x80\x94a doubt whether the threatened conspiracy had evaporated in mere\r\nwords, or whether she and her master were likely to hear of it again.\r\nAt this point her thoughts broke off once more, and there was a\r\nmomentary blank. The next instant she started up in bed; her heart\r\nbeating violently, her head whirling as if she had lost her senses.\r\nWith electric suddenness her mind pieced together its scattered\r\nmultitude of thoughts, and put them before her plainly under one\r\nintelligible form. In the all-mastering agitation of the moment, she\r\nclapped her hands together, and cried out suddenly in the darkness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vanstone again!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got out of bed and kindled the light once more. Steady as her\r\nnerves were, the shock of her own suspicion had shaken them. Her firm\r\nhand trembled as she opened her dressing-case and took from it a little\r\nbottle of sal-volatile. In spite of her smooth cheeks and her\r\nwell-preserved hair, she looked every year of her age as she mixed the\r\nspirit with water, greedily drank it, and, wrapping her dressing-gown\r\nround her, sat down on the bedside to get possession again of her\r\ncalmer self.\r\n\r\nShe was quite incapable of tracing the mental process which had led her\r\nto discovery. She could not get sufficiently far from herself to see\r\nthat her half-formed conclusions on the subject of the Bygraves had\r\nended in making that family objects of suspicion to her; that the\r\nassociation of ideas had thereupon carried her mind back to that other\r\nobject of suspicion which was represented by the conspiracy against her\r\nmaster; and that the two ideas of those two separate subjects of\r\ndistrust, coming suddenly in contact, had struck the light. She was not\r\nable to reason back in this way from the effect to the cause. She could\r\nonly feel that the suspicion had become more than a suspicion already:\r\nconviction itself could not have been more firmly rooted in her mind.\r\n\r\nLooking back at Magdalen by the new light now thrown on her, Mrs.\r\nLecount would fain have persuaded herself that she recognized some\r\ntraces left of the false Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s face and figure in the graceful\r\nand beautiful girl who had sat at her master\xe2\x80\x99s table hardly an hour\r\nsince\xe2\x80\x94that she found resemblances now, which she had never thought of\r\nbefore, between the angry voice she had heard in Vauxhall Walk and the\r\nsmooth, well-bred tones which still hung on her ears after the\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x99s experience downstairs. She would fain have persuaded herself\r\nthat she had reached these results with no undue straining of the truth\r\nas she really knew it, but the effort was in vain.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount was not a woman to waste time and thought in trying to\r\nimpose on herself. She accepted the inevitable conclusion that the\r\nguesswork of a moment had led her to discovery. And, more than that,\r\nshe recognized the plain truth\xe2\x80\x94unwelcome as it was\xe2\x80\x94that the conviction\r\nnow fixed in her own mind was thus far unsupported by a single fragment\r\nof producible evidence to justify it to the minds of others.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, what was the safe course to take with her\r\nmaster?\r\n\r\nIf she candidly told him, when they met the next morning, what had\r\npassed through her mind that night, her knowledge of Noel Vanstone\r\nwarned her that one of two results would certainly happen. Either he\r\nwould be angry and disputatious; would ask for proofs; and, finding\r\nnone forthcoming, would accuse her of alarming him without a cause, to\r\nserve her own jealous end of keeping Magdalen out of the house; or he\r\nwould be seriously startled, would clamor for the protection of the\r\nlaw, and would warn the Bygraves to stand on their defense at the\r\noutset. If Magdalen only had been concerned in the plot this latter\r\nconsequence would have assumed no great importance in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind. But seeing the deception as she now saw it, she was far too\r\nclever a woman to fail in estimating the captain\xe2\x80\x99s inexhaustible\r\nfertility of resource at its true value. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can\xe2\x80\x99t meet this impudent\r\nvillain with plain proofs to help me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cI may\r\nopen my master\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to-morrow morning, and Mr. Bygrave will shut them\r\nup again before night. The rascal is playing with all his own cards\r\nunder the table, and he will win the game to a certainty, if he sees my\r\nhand at starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis policy of waiting was so manifestly the wise policy\xe2\x80\x94the wily Mr.\r\nBygrave was so sure to have provided himself, in case of emergency,\r\nwith evidence to prove the identity which he and his niece had assumed\r\nfor their purpose\xe2\x80\x94that Mrs. Lecount at once decided to keep her own\r\ncounsel the next morning, and to pause before attacking the conspiracy\r\nuntil she could produce unanswerable facts to help her. Her master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintance with the Bygraves was only an acquaintance of one day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstanding. There was no fear of its developing into a dangerous intimacy\r\nif she merely allowed it to continue for a few days more, and if she\r\npermanently checked it, at the latest, in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\n\r\nIn that period what measures could she take to remove the obstacles\r\nwhich now stood in her way, and to provide herself with the weapons\r\nwhich she now wanted?\r\n\r\nReflection showed her three different chances in her favor\xe2\x80\x94three\r\ndifferent ways of arriving at the necessary discovery.\r\n\r\nThe first chance was to cultivate friendly terms with Magdalen, and\r\nthen, taking her unawares, to entrap her into betraying herself in Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s presence. The second chance was to write to the elder Miss\r\nVanstone, and to ask (with some alarming reason for putting the\r\nquestion) for information on the subject of her younger sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhereabouts, and of any peculiarities in her personal appearance which\r\nmight enable a stranger to identify her. The third chance was to\r\npenetrate the mystery of Mrs. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s seclusion, and to ascertain at\r\na personal interview whether the invalid lady\xe2\x80\x99s real complaint might\r\nnot possibly be a defective capacity for keeping her husband\xe2\x80\x99s secrets.\r\nResolving to try all three chances, in the order in which they are here\r\nenumerated, and to set her snares for Magdalen on the day that was now\r\nalready at hand, Mrs. Lecount at last took off her dressing-gown and\r\nallowed her weaker nature to plead with her for a little sleep.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was breaking over the cold gray sea as she lay down in her bed\r\nagain. The last idea in her mind before she fell asleep was\r\ncharacteristic of the woman\xe2\x80\x94it was an idea that threatened the captain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has trifled with the sacred memory of my husband,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s widow. \xe2\x80\x9cOn my life and honor, I will make him pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Magdalen began the day, according to her\r\nagreement with the captain, by taking Mrs. Wragge out for a little\r\nexercise at an hour when there was no fear of her attracting the public\r\nattention. She pleaded hard to be left at home; having the Oriental\r\nCashmere Robe still on her mind, and feeling it necessary to read her\r\ndirections for dressmaking, for the hundredth time at least, before (to\r\nuse her own expression) she could \xe2\x80\x9cscrew up her courage to put the\r\nscissors into the stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d But her companion would take no denial, and\r\nshe was forced to go out. The one guileless purpose of the life which\r\nMagdalen now led was the resolution that poor Mrs. Wragge should not be\r\nmade a prisoner on her account; and to that resolution she mechanically\r\nclung, as the last token left her by which she knew her better-self.\r\n\r\nThey returned later than usual to breakfast. While Mrs. Wragge was\r\nupstairs, straightening herself from head to foot to meet the morning\r\ninspection of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s orderly eye; and while Magdalen and the\r\ncaptain were waiting for her in the parlor, the servant came in with a\r\nnote from Sea-view Cottage. The messenger was waiting for an answer,\r\nand the note was addressed to Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\nThe captain opened the note and read these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR,\r\n    Mr. Noel Vanstone desires me to write and tell you that he proposes\r\n    enjoying this fine day by taking a long drive to a place on the\r\n    coast here called Dunwich. He is anxious to know if you will share\r\n    the expense of a carriage, and give him the pleasure of your\r\n    company and Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s company on this excursion. I am kindly\r\n    permitted to be one of the party; and if I may say so without\r\n    impropriety, I would venture to add that I shall feel as much\r\n    pleasure as my master if you and your young lady will consent to\r\n    join us. We propose leaving Aldborough punctually at eleven\r\n    o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear sir,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour humble servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVIRGINIE LECOUNT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the letter from?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, noticing a change in Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x99s face as he read it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they want with us at Sea-view\r\nCottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthis requires consideration.\r\nLet me have a minute or two to think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a few turns up and down the room, then suddenly stepped aside\r\nto a table in a corner on which his writing materials were placed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas not born yesterday, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, speaking jocosely to\r\nhimself. He winked his brown eye, took up his pen, and wrote the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you speak now?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Magdalen, when the servant had left the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that letter say, and how have you answered it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain placed the letter in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI have accepted the\r\ninvitation,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, quietly.\r\n\r\nMagdalen read the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cHidden enmity yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nopen friendship to-day. What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mrs. Lecount is even sharper\r\nthan I thought her. She has found you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite impossible in the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say _how_ she has found you out,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the captain, with\r\nperfect composure. \xe2\x80\x9cShe may know more of your voice than we supposed\r\nshe knew. Or she may have thought us, on reflection, rather a\r\nsuspicious family; and anything suspicious in which a woman was\r\nconcerned may have taken her mind back to that morning call of yours in\r\nVauxhall Walk. Whichever way it may be, the meaning of this sudden\r\nchange is clear enough. She has found you out; and she wants to put her\r\ndiscovery to the proof by slipping in an awkward question or two, under\r\ncover of a little friendly talk. My experience of humanity has been a\r\nvaried one, and Mrs. Lecount is not the first sharp practitioner in\r\npetticoats whom I have had to deal with. All the world\xe2\x80\x99s a stage, my\r\ndear girl, and one of the scenes on our little stage is shut in from\r\nthis moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he took his copy of Joyce\xe2\x80\x99s Scientific Dialogues out\r\nof his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re done with already, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain,\r\ngiving his useful information a farewell smack with his hand, and\r\nlocking it up in the cupboard. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch is human popularity!\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe indomitable vagabond, putting the key cheerfully in his pocket.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday Joyce was my all-in-all. To-day I don\xe2\x80\x99t care that for him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe snapped his fingers and sat down to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, looking at him angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou leaving me to my own resources for the future?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Captain Wragge, \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t you accustom yourself to\r\nmy dash of humor yet? I have done with my ready-made science simply\r\nbecause I am quite sure that Mrs. Lecount has done believing in me.\r\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I accepted the invitation to Dunwich? Make your mind easy. The\r\nhelp I have given you already counts for nothing compared with the help\r\nI am going to give you now. My honor is concerned in bowling out Mrs.\r\nLecount. This last move of hers has made it a personal matter between\r\nus. _The woman actually thinks she can take me in!!!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\ncaptain, striking his knife-handle on the table in a transport of\r\nvirtuous indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens, I never was so insulted before in my\r\nlife! Draw your chair in to the table, my dear, and give me half a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x99s attention to what I have to say next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen obeyed him. Captain Wragge cautiously lowered his voice before\r\nhe went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you all along,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe one thing needful is never\r\nto let Mrs. Lecount catch you with your wits wool-gathering. I say the\r\nsame after what has happened this morning. Let her suspect you! I defy\r\nher to find a fragment of foundation for her suspicions, unless we help\r\nher. We shall see to-day if she has been foolish enough to betray\r\nherself to her master before she has any facts to support her. I doubt\r\nit. If she has told him, we will rain down proofs of our identity with\r\nthe Bygraves on his feeble little head till it absolutely aches with\r\nconviction. You have two things to do on this excursion. First, to\r\ndistrust every word Mrs. Lecount says to you. Secondly, to exert all\r\nyour fascinations, and make sure of Mr. Noel Vanstone, dating from\r\nto-day. I will give you the opportunity when we leave the carriage and\r\ntake our walk at Dunwich. Wear your hat, wear your smile; do your\r\nfigure justice, lace tight; put on your neatest boots and brightest\r\ngloves; tie the miserable little wretch to your apron-string\xe2\x80\x94tie him\r\nfast; and leave the whole management of the matter after that to me.\r\nSteady! here is Mrs. Wragge: we must be doubly careful in looking after\r\nher now. Show me your cap, Mrs. Wragge! show me your shoes! What do I\r\nsee on your apron? A spot? I won\xe2\x80\x99t have spots! Take it off after\r\nbreakfast, and put on another. Pull your chair to the middle of the\r\ntable\xe2\x80\x94more to the left\xe2\x80\x94more still. Make the breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a quarter before eleven Mrs. Wragge (with her own entire\r\nconcurrence) was dismissed to the back room, to bewilder herself over\r\nthe science of dressmaking for the rest of the day. Punctually as the\r\nclock struck the hour, Mrs. Lecount and her master drove up to the gate\r\nof North Shingles, and found Magdalen and Captain Wragge waiting for\r\nthem in the garden.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Dunwich nothing occurred to disturb the enjoyment of the\r\ndrive. Noel Vanstone was in excellent health and high good-humor.\r\nLecount had apologized for the little misunderstanding of the previous\r\nnight; Lecount had petitioned for the excursion as a treat to herself.\r\nHe thought of these concessions, and looked at Magdalen, and smirked\r\nand simpered without intermission. Mrs. Lecount acted her part to\r\nperfection. She was motherly with Magdalen and tenderly attentive to\r\nNoel Vanstone. She was deeply interested in Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconversation, and meekly disappointed to find it turn on general\r\nsubjects, to the exclusion of science. Not a word or look escaped her\r\nwhich hinted in the remotest degree at her real purpose. She was\r\ndressed with her customary elegance and propriety; and she was the only\r\none of the party on that sultry summer\xe2\x80\x99s day who was perfectly cool in\r\nthe hottest part of the journey.\r\n\r\nAs they left the carriage on their arrival at Dunwich, the captain\r\nseized a moment when Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s eye was off him and fortified\r\nMagdalen by a last warning word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ware the cat!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will show her claws on the way\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey left the village and walked to the ruins of a convent near at\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94the last relic of the once populous city of Dunwich which has\r\nsurvived the destruction of the place, centuries since, by the\r\nall-devouring sea. After looking at the ruins, they sought the shade of\r\na little wood between the village and the low sand-hills which overlook\r\nthe German Ocean. Here Captain Wragge maneuvered so as to let Magdalen\r\nand Noel Vanstone advance some distance in front of Mrs. Lecount and\r\nhimself, took the wrong path, and immediately lost his way with the\r\nmost consummate dexterity. After a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 wandering (in the wrong\r\ndirection), he reached an open space near the sea; and politely opening\r\nhis camp-stool for the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s accommodation, proposed waiting\r\nwhere they were until the missing members of the party came that way\r\nand discovered them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount accepted the proposal. She was perfectly well aware that\r\nher escort had lost himself on purpose, but that discovery exercised no\r\ndisturbing influence on the smooth amiability of her manner. Her day of\r\nreckoning with the captain had not come yet\xe2\x80\x94she merely added the new\r\nitem to her list, and availed herself of the camp-stool. Captain Wragge\r\nstretched himself in a romantic attitude at her feet, and the two\r\ndetermined enemies (grouped like two lovers in a picture) fell into as\r\neasy and pleasant a conversation as if they had been friends of twenty\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the captain, while Mrs. Lecount was\r\ntalking to him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would like to catch me tripping in my ready-made\r\nscience, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t object to drown me in the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s Tank!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou villain with the brown eye and the green!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Lecount,\r\nas the captain caught the ball of conversation in his turn; \xe2\x80\x9cthick as\r\nyour skin is, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sting you through it yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind toward each other they talked fluently on general\r\nsubjects, on public affairs, on local scenery, on society in England\r\nand society in Switzerland, on health, climate, books, marriage and\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94talked, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, without a single\r\nmisunderstanding on either side for nearly an hour, before Magdalen and\r\nNoel Vanstone strayed that way and made the party of four complete\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the inn at which the carriage was waiting for them,\r\nCaptain Wragge left Mrs. Lecount in undisturbed possession of her\r\nmaster, and signed to Magdalen to drop back for a moment and speak to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain, in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cis he fast to your\r\napron-string?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shuddered from head to foot as she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has kissed my hand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes that tell you enough? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet him sit next me on the way home! I have borne all I can bear\xe2\x80\x94spare\r\nme for the rest of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put you on the front seat of the carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cside by side with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the journey back Mrs. Lecount verified Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s prediction.\r\nShe showed her claws.\r\n\r\nThe time could not have been better chosen; the circumstances could\r\nhardly have favored her more. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s spirits were depressed: she\r\nwas weary in body and mind; and she sat exactly opposite the\r\nhousekeeper, who had been compelled, by the new arrangement, to occupy\r\nthe seat of honor next her master. With every facility for observing\r\nthe slightest changes that passed over Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s face, Mrs. Lecount\r\ntried her first experiment by leading the conversation to the subject\r\nof London, and to the relative advantages offered to residents by the\r\nvarious quarters of the metropolis on both sides of the river. The\r\never-ready Wragge penetrated her intention sooner than she had\r\nanticipated, and interposed immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re coming to Vauxhall\r\nWalk, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the captain; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get there before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe entered at once into a purely fictitious description of the various\r\nquarters of London in which he had himself resided; and, adroitly\r\nmentioning Vauxhall Walk as one of them, saved Magdalen from the sudden\r\nquestion relating to that very locality with which Mrs. Lecount had\r\nproposed startling her, to begin with. From his residences he passed\r\nsmoothly to himself, and poured his whole family history (in the\r\ncharacter of Mr. Bygrave) into the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s ears\xe2\x80\x94not forgetting\r\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s grave in Honduras, with the monument by the self-taught\r\nnegro artist, and his brother\xe2\x80\x99s hugely corpulent widow, on the\r\nground-floor of the boarding-house at Cheltenham. As a means of giving\r\nMagdalen time to compose herself, this outburst of autobiographical\r\ninformation attained its object, but it answered no other purpose. Mrs.\r\nLecount listened, without being imposed on by a single word the captain\r\nsaid to her. He merely confirmed her conviction of the hopelessness of\r\ntaking Noel Vanstone into her confidence before she had facts to help\r\nher against Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise unassailable position in the\r\nidentity which he had assumed. She quietly waited until he had done,\r\nand then returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a coincidence that your uncle should have once resided in\r\nVauxhall Walk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, addressing herself to Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Noel has\r\na house in the same place, and we lived there before we came to\r\nAldborough. May I inquire, Miss Bygrave, whether you know anything of a\r\nlady named Miss Garth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time she put the question before the captain could interfere.\r\nMagdalen ought to have been prepared for it by what had already passed\r\nin her presence, but her nerves had been shaken by the earlier events\r\nof the day; and she could only answer the question in the negative,\r\nafter an instant\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary pause to control herself. Her hesitation\r\nwas of too momentary a nature to attract the attention of any\r\nunsuspicious person. But it lasted long enough to confirm Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s private convictions, and to encourage her to advance a little\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only asked,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, steadily fixing her eyes on Magdalen,\r\nsteadily disregarding the efforts which Captain Wragge made to join in\r\nthe conversation, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause Miss Garth is a stranger to me, and I am\r\ncurious to find out what I can about her. The day before we left town,\r\nMiss Bygrave, a person who presented herself under the name I have\r\nmentioned paid us a visit under very extraordinary circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a smooth, ingratiating manner, with a refinement of contempt which\r\nwas little less than devilish in its ingenious assumption of the\r\nlanguage of pity, she now boldly described Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in\r\ndisguise in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s own presence. She slightingly referred to the\r\nmaster and mistress of Combe-Raven as persons who had always annoyed\r\nthe elder and more respectable branch of the family; she mourned over\r\nthe children as following their parents\xe2\x80\x99 example, and attempting to\r\ntake a mercenary advantage of Mr. Noel Vanstone, under the protection\r\nof a respectable person\xe2\x80\x99s character and a respectable person\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\nCleverly including her master in the conversation, so as to prevent the\r\ncaptain from effecting a diversion in that quarter; sparing no petty\r\naggravation; striking at every tender place which the tongue of a\r\nspiteful woman can wound, she would, beyond all doubt, have carried her\r\npoint, and tortured Magdalen into openly betraying herself, if Captain\r\nWragge had not checked her in full career by a loud exclamation of\r\nalarm, and a sudden clutch at Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand pardons, my dear madam!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI see in my\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s face, I feel in my niece\xe2\x80\x99s pulse, that one of her violent\r\nneuralgic attacks has come on again. My dear girl, why hesitate among\r\nfriends to confess that you are in pain? What mistimed politeness! Her\r\nface shows she is suffering\xe2\x80\x94doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it Mrs. Lecount? Darting pains, Mr.\r\nVanstone, darting pains on the left side of the head. Pull down your\r\nveil, my dear, and lean on me. Our friends will excuse you; our\r\nexcellent friends will excuse you for the rest of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Mrs. Lecount could throw an instant\xe2\x80\x99s doubt on the genuineness\r\nof the neuralgic attack, her master\xe2\x80\x99s fidgety sympathy declared itself\r\nexactly as the captain had anticipated, in the most active\r\nmanifestations. He stopped the carriage, and insisted on an immediate\r\nchange in the arrangement of the places\xe2\x80\x94the comfortable back seat for\r\nMiss Bygrave and her uncle, the front seat for Lecount and himself. Had\r\nLecount got her smelling-bottle? Excellent creature! let her give it\r\ndirectly to Miss Bygrave, and let the coachman drive carefully. If the\r\ncoachman shook Miss Bygrave he should not have a half-penny for\r\nhimself. Mesmerism was frequently useful in these cases. Mr. Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s father had been the most powerful mesmerist in Europe, and\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone was his father\xe2\x80\x99s son. Might he mesmerize? Might he\r\norder that infernal coachman to draw up in a shady place adapted for\r\nthe purpose? Would medical help be preferred? Could medical help be\r\nfound any nearer than Aldborough? That ass of a coachman didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\nStop every respectable man who passed in a gig, and ask him if he was a\r\ndoctor! So Mr. Noel Vanstone ran on, with brief intervals for\r\nbreathing-time, in a continually-ascending scale of sympathy and\r\nself-importance, throughout the drive home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount accepted her defeat without uttering a word. From the\r\nmoment when Captain Wragge interrupted her, her thin lips closed and\r\nopened no more for the remainder of the journey. The warmest\r\nexpressions of her master\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety for the suffering young lady\r\nprovoked from her no outward manifestations of anger. She took as\r\nlittle notice of him as possible. She paid no attention whatever to the\r\ncaptain, whose exasperating consideration for his vanquished enemy made\r\nhim more polite to her than ever. The nearer and the nearer they got to\r\nAldborough the more and more fixedly Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s hard black eyes\r\nlooked at Magdalen reclining on the opposite seat, with her eyes closed\r\nand her veil down.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the carriage stopped at North Shingles, and when\r\nCaptain Wragge was handing Magdalen out, that the housekeeper at last\r\ncondescended to notice him. As he smiled and took off his hat at the\r\ncarriage door, the strong restraint she had laid on herself suddenly\r\ngave way, and she flashed one look at him which scorched up the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s politeness on the spot. He turned at once, with a hasty\r\nacknowledgment of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s last sympathetic inquiries, and took\r\nMagdalen into the house. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you she would show her claws,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my fault that she scratched you before I could stop\r\nher. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you, has she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has hurt me, to some purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe has given me the\r\ncourage to go on. Say what must be done to-morrow, and trust me to do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed heavily as she said those words, and went up to her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge walked meditatively into the parlor, and sat down to\r\nconsider. He felt by no means so certain as he could have wished of the\r\nnext proceeding on the part of the enemy after the defeat of that day.\r\nThe housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s farewell look had plainly informed him that she was\r\nnot at the end of her resources yet, and the old militia-man felt the\r\nfull importance of preparing himself in good time to meet the next step\r\nwhich she took in advance. He lit a cigar, and bent his wary mind on\r\nthe dangers of the future.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Wragge was considering in the parlor at North Shingles,\r\nMrs. Lecount was meditating in her bedroom at Sea View. Her\r\nexasperation at the failure of her first attempt to expose the\r\nconspiracy had not blinded her to the instant necessity of making a\r\nsecond effort before Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s growing infatuation got beyond her\r\ncontrol. The snare set for Magdalen having failed, the chance of\r\nentrapping Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s sister was the next chance to try. Mrs. Lecount\r\nordered a cup of tea, opened her writing-case, and began the rough\r\ndraft of a letter to be sent to Miss Vanstone, the elder, by the\r\nmorrow\xe2\x80\x99s post.\r\n\r\nSo the day\xe2\x80\x99s skirmish ended. The heat of the battle was yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAll human penetration has its limits. Accurately as Captain Wragge had\r\nseen his way hitherto, even his sharp insight was now at fault. He\r\nfinished his cigar with the mortifying conviction that he was totally\r\nunprepared for Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s next proceeding. In this emergency, his\r\nexperience warned him that there was one safe course, and one only,\r\nwhich he could take. He resolved to try the confusing effect on the\r\nhousekeeper of a complete change of tactics before she had time to\r\npress her advantage and attack him in the dark. With this view he sent\r\nthe servant upstairs to request that Miss Bygrave would come down and\r\nspeak to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, when Magdalen entered\r\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to apologize for the smell of tobacco, and to say\r\ntwo words on the subject of our next proceedings. To put it with my\r\ncustomary frankness, Mrs. Lecount puzzles me, and I propose to return\r\nthe compliment by puzzling her. The course of action which I have to\r\nsuggest is a very simple one. I have had the honor of giving you a\r\nsevere neuralgic attack already, and I beg your permission (when Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone sends to inquire to-morrow morning) to take the further\r\nliberty of laying you up altogether. Question from Sea-view Cottage:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is Miss Bygrave this morning?\xe2\x80\x99 Answer from North Shingles: \xe2\x80\x98Much\r\nworse: Miss Bygrave is confined to her room.\xe2\x80\x99 Question repeated every\r\nday, say for a fortnight: \xe2\x80\x98How is Miss Bygrave?\xe2\x80\x99 Answer repeated, if\r\nnecessary, for the same time: \xe2\x80\x98No better.\xe2\x80\x99 Can you bear the\r\nimprisonment? I see no objection to your getting a breath of fresh air\r\nthe first thing in the morning, or the last thing at night. But for the\r\nwhole of the day, there is no disguising it, you must put yourself in\r\nthe same category with Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x94you must keep your room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your object in wishing me to do this?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy object is twofold,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI blush for my own\r\nstupidity; but the fact is, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see my way plainly to Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s next move. All I feel sure of is, that she means to make\r\nanother attempt at opening her master\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to the truth. Whatever\r\nmeans she may employ to discover your identity, personal communication\r\nwith you _must_ be necessary to the accomplishment of her object. Very\r\ngood. If I stop that communication, I put an obstacle in her way at\r\nstarting\xe2\x80\x94or, as we say at cards, I force her hand. Do you see the\r\npoint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen saw it plainly. The captain went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy second reason for shutting you up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9crefers entirely to\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s master. The growth of love, my dear girl, is, in one\r\nrespect, unlike all other growths\xe2\x80\x94it flourishes under adverse\r\ncircumstances. Our first course of action is to make Mr. Noel Vanstone\r\nfeel the charm of your society. Our next is to drive him distracted by\r\nthe loss of it. I should have proposed a few more meetings, with a view\r\nto furthering this end, but for our present critical position toward\r\nMrs. Lecount. As it is, we must trust to the effect you produced\r\nyesterday, and try the experiment of a sudden separation rather sooner\r\nthan I could have otherwise wished. I shall see Mr. Noel Vanstone,\r\nthough you don\xe2\x80\x99t; and if there _is_ a raw place established anywhere\r\nabout the region of that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s heart, trust me to hit him on it!\r\nYou are now in full possession of my views. Take your time to consider,\r\nand give me your answer\xe2\x80\x94Yes or no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny change is for the better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen \xe2\x80\x9cwhich keeps me out of\r\nthe company of Mrs. Lecount and her master! Let it be as you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had hitherto answered faintly and wearily; but she spoke those last\r\nwords with a heightened tone and a rising color\xe2\x80\x94signs which warned\r\nCaptain Wragge not to press her further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAs usual, we understand each other. I\r\nsee you are tired; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t detain you any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose to open the door, stopped half-way to it, and came back again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me to arrange matters with the servant downstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t absolutely keep your bed, and we must purchase\r\nthe girl\xe2\x80\x99s discretion when she answers the door, without taking her\r\ninto our confidence, of course. I will make her understand that she is\r\nto say you are ill, just as she might say you are not at home, as a way\r\nof keeping unwelcome acquaintances out of the house. Allow me to open\r\nthe door for you\xe2\x80\x94I beg your pardon, you are going into Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork-room instead of going to your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to remove Mrs. Wragge from the\r\nmiserable room she is in now, and to take her upstairs with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the whole fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge followed her into the dining-room, and wisely closed the\r\ndoor before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you seriously mean to inflict my wife\xe2\x80\x99s society on yourself for a\r\nfortnight?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in great surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife is the only innocent creature in this guilty house,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nburst out vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cI must and will have her with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t agitate yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cTake Mrs. Wragge, by\r\nall means. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want her.\xe2\x80\x9d Having resigned the partner of his\r\nexistence in those terms, he discreetly returned to the parlor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nweakness of the sex!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the captain, tapping his sagacious head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay a strain on the female intellect, and the female temper gives way\r\ndirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strain to which the captain alluded was not confined that evening\r\nto the female intellect at North Shingles: it extended to the female\r\nintellect at Sea View. For nearly two hours Mrs. Lecount sat at her\r\ndesk writing, correcting, and writing again, before she could produce a\r\nletter to Miss Vanstone, the elder, which exactly accomplished the\r\nobject she wanted to attain. At last the rough draft was completed to\r\nher satisfaction; and she made a fair copy of it forthwith, to be\r\nposted the next day.\r\n\r\nHer letter thus produced was a masterpiece of ingenuity. After the\r\nfirst preliminary sentences, the housekeeper plainly informed Norah of\r\nthe appearance of the visitor in disguise at Vauxhall Walk; of the\r\nconversation which passed at the interview; and of her own suspicion\r\nthat the person claiming to be Miss Garth was, in all probability, the\r\nyounger Miss Vanstone herself. Having told the truth thus far, Mrs.\r\nLecount next proceeded to say that her master was in possession of\r\nevidence which would justify him in putting the law in force; that he\r\nknew the conspiracy with which he was threatened to be then in process\r\nof direction against him at Aldborough; and that he only hesitated to\r\nprotect himself in deference to family considerations, and in the hope\r\nthat the elder Miss Vanstone might so influence her sister as to render\r\nit unnecessary to proceed to extremities.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances (the letter continued) it was plainly\r\nnecessary that the disguised visitor to Vauxhall Walk should be\r\nproperly identified; for if Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s guess proved to be wrong,\r\nand if the person turned out to be a stranger, Mr. Noel Vanstone was\r\npositively resolved to prosecute in his own defense. Events at\r\nAldborough, on which it was not necessary to dwell, would enable Mrs.\r\nLecount in a few days to gain sight of the suspected person in her own\r\ncharacter. But as the housekeeper was entirely unacquainted with the\r\nyounger Miss Vanstone, it was obviously desirable that some better\r\ninformed person should, in this particular, take the matter in hand. If\r\nthe elder Miss Vanstone happened to be at liberty to come to Aldborough\r\nherself, would she kindly write and say so? and Mrs. Lecount would\r\nwrite back again to appoint a day. If, on the other hand, Miss Vanstone\r\nwas prevented from taking the journey, Mrs. Lecount suggested that her\r\nreply should contain the fullest description of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s personal\r\nappearance\xe2\x80\x94should mention any little peculiarities which might exist in\r\nthe way of marks on her face or her hands\xe2\x80\x94and should state (in case she\r\nhad written lately) what the address was in her last letter, and\r\nfailing that, what the post-mark was on the envelope. With this\r\ninformation to help her, Mrs. Lecount would, in the interest of the\r\nmisguided young lady herself, accept the responsibility of privately\r\nidentifying her, and would write back immediately to acquaint the elder\r\nMiss Vanstone with the result.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of sending this letter to the right address gave Mrs.\r\nLecount very little trouble. Remembering the name of the lawyer who had\r\npleaded the cause of the two sisters in Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s time, she\r\ndirected her letter to \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vanstone, care of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Pendril, Esquire,\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d This she inclosed in a second envelope, addressed to Mr. Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor, with a line inside, requesting that gentleman to\r\nsend it at once to the office of Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Lecount, as she locked the letter up in her desk,\r\npreparatory to posting it the next day with her own hand, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I have\r\ngot her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning the servant from Sea View came, with her master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompliments, to make inquiries after Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s health. Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x99s bulletin was duly announced\xe2\x80\x94Miss Bygrave was so ill as to be\r\nconfined to her room.\r\n\r\nOn the reception of this intelligence, Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety led him\r\nto call at North Shingles himself when he went out for his afternoon\r\nwalk. Miss Bygrave was no better. He inquired if he could see Mr.\r\nBygrave. The worthy captain was prepared to meet this emergency. He\r\nthought a little irritating suspense would do Noel Vanstone no harm,\r\nand he had carefully charged the servant, in case of necessity, with\r\nher answer: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bygrave begged to be excused; he was not able to see\r\nany one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the second day inquiries were made as before, by message in the\r\nmorning, and by Noel Vanstone himself in the afternoon. The morning\r\nanswer (relating to Magdalen) was, \xe2\x80\x9ca shade better.\xe2\x80\x9d The afternoon\r\nanswer (relating to Captain Wragge) was, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bygrave has just gone\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d That evening Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s temper was very uncertain, and Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s patience and tact were sorely tried in the effort to avoid\r\noffending him.\r\n\r\nOn the third morning the report of the suffering young lady was less\r\nfavorable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bygrave was still very poorly, and not able to leave\r\nher bed.\xe2\x80\x9d The servant returning to Sea View with this message, met the\r\npostman, and took into the breakfast-room with her two letters\r\naddressed to Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nThe first letter was in a handwriting familiar to the housekeeper. It\r\nwas from the medical attendant on her invalid brother at Zurich; and it\r\nannounced that the patient\xe2\x80\x99s malady had latterly altered in so marked a\r\nmanner for the better that there was every hope now of preserving his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe address on the second letter was in a strange handwriting. Mrs.\r\nLecount, concluding that it was the answer from Miss Vanstone, waited\r\nto read it until breakfast was over, and she could retire to her own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nShe opened the letter, looked at once for the name at the end, and\r\nstarted a little as she read it. The signature was not \xe2\x80\x9cNorah\r\nVanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cHarriet Garth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Garth announced that the elder Miss Vanstone had, a week since,\r\naccepted an engagement as governess, subject to the condition of\r\njoining the family of her employer at their temporary residence in the\r\nsouth of France, and of returning with them when they came back to\r\nEngland, probably in a month or six weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time. During the interval of\r\nthis necessary absence Miss Vanstone had requested Miss Garth to open\r\nall her letters, her main object in making that arrangement being to\r\nprovide for the speedy answering of any communication which might\r\narrive for her from her sister. Miss Magdalen Vanstone had not written\r\nsince the middle of July\xe2\x80\x94on which occasion the postmark on the letter\r\nshowed that it must have been posted in London, in the district of\r\nLambeth\xe2\x80\x94and her elder sister had left England in a state of the most\r\ndistressing anxiety on her account.\r\n\r\nHaving completed this explanation, Miss Garth then mentioned that\r\nfamily circumstances prevented her from traveling personally to\r\nAldborough to assist Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s object, but that she was provided\r\nwith a substitute; in every way fitter for the purpose, in the person\r\nof Mr. Pendril. That gentleman was well acquainted with Miss Magdalen\r\nVanstone, and his professional experience and discretion would render\r\nhis assistance doubly valuable. He had kindly consented to travel to\r\nAldborough whenever it might be thought necessary. But as his time was\r\nvery valuable, Miss Garth specially requested that he might not be sent\r\nfor until Mrs. Lecount was quite sure of the day on which his services\r\nmight be required.\r\n\r\nWhile proposing this arrangement, Miss Garth added that she thought it\r\nright to furnish her correspondent with a written description of the\r\nyounger Miss Vanstone as well. An emergency might happen which would\r\nallow Mrs. Lecount no time for securing Mr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s services; and the\r\nexecution of Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s intentions toward the unhappy girl who\r\nwas the object of his forbearance might be fatally delayed by an\r\nunforeseen difficulty in establishing her identity. The personal\r\ndescription, transmitted under these circumstances, then followed. It\r\nomitted no personal peculiarity by which Magdalen could be recognized,\r\nand it included the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo little moles close together on the left side\r\nof the neck,\xe2\x80\x9d which had been formerly mentioned in the printed\r\nhandbills sent to York.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Miss Garth expressed her fears that Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions were only too likely to be proved true. While, however,\r\nthere was the faintest chance that the conspiracy might turn out to be\r\ndirected by a stranger, Miss Garth felt bound, in gratitude toward Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone, to assist the legal proceedings which would in that case\r\nbe instituted. She accordingly appended her own formal denial\xe2\x80\x94which she\r\nwould personally repeat if necessary\xe2\x80\x94of any identity between herself\r\nand the person in disguise who had made use of her name. She was the\r\nMiss Garth who had filled the situation of the late Mr. Andrew\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s governess, and she had never in her life been in, or near,\r\nthe neighborhood of Vauxhall Wall.\r\n\r\nWith this disclaimer, and with the writer\xe2\x80\x99s fervent assurances that she\r\nwould do all for Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s advantage which her sister might have done\r\nif her sister had been in England, the letter concluded. It was signed\r\nin full, and was dated with the business-like accuracy in such matters\r\nwhich had always distinguished Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s character.\r\n\r\nThis letter placed a formidable weapon in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nIt provided a means of establishing Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s identity through the\r\nintervention of a lawyer by profession. It contained a personal\r\ndescription minute enough to be used to advantage, if necessary, before\r\nMr. Pendril\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. It presented a signed exposure of the false\r\nMiss Garth under the hand of the true Miss Garth; and it established\r\nthe fact that the last letter received by the elder Miss Vanstone from\r\nthe younger had been posted (and therefore probably written) in the\r\nneighborhood of Vauxhall Walk. If any later letter had been received\r\nwith the Aldborough postmark, the chain of evidence, so far as the\r\nquestion of localities was concerned, might doubtless have been more\r\ncomplete. But as it was, there was testimony enough (aided as that\r\ntestimony might be by the fragment of the brown alpaca dress still in\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s possession) to raise the veil which hung over the\r\nconspiracy, and to place Mr. Noel Vanstone face to face with the plain\r\nand startling truth.\r\n\r\nThe one obstacle which now stood in the way of immediate action on the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s part was the obstacle of Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s present seclusion\r\nwithin the limits of her own room. The question of gaining personal\r\naccess to her was a question which must be decided before any\r\ncommunication could be opened with Mr. Pendril. Mrs. Lecount put on her\r\nbonnet at once, and called at North Shingles to try what discoveries\r\nshe could make for herself before post-time.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Mr. Bygrave was at home, and she was admitted without\r\nthe least difficulty.\r\n\r\nCareful consideration that morning had decided Captain Wragge on\r\nadvancing matters a little nearer to the crisis. The means by which he\r\nproposed achieving this result made it necessary for him to see the\r\nhousekeeper and her master separately, and to set them at variance by\r\nproducing two totally opposite impressions relating to himself on their\r\nminds. Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s visit, therefore, instead of causing him any\r\nembarrassment, was the most welcome occurrence he could have wished\r\nfor. He received her in the parlor with a marked restraint of manner\r\nfor which she was quite unprepared. His ingratiating smile was gone,\r\nand an impenetrable solemnity of countenance appeared in its stead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have ventured to intrude on you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nexpress the regret with which both my master and I have heard of Miss\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x99s illness. Is there no improvement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, as briefly as possible. \xe2\x80\x9cMy niece is\r\nno better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had some experience, Mr. Bygrave, in nursing. If I could be of\r\nany use\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mrs. Lecount. There is no necessity for our taking\r\nadvantage of your kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis plain answer was followed by a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence. The housekeeper\r\nfelt some little perplexity. What had become of Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s elaborate\r\ncourtesy, and Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s many words? Did he want to offend her? If\r\nhe did, Mrs. Lecount then and there determined that he should not gain\r\nhis object.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire the nature of the illness?\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not\r\nconnected, I hope, with our excursion to Dunwich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI regret to say, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cit began with that\r\nneuralgic attack in the carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! so!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even _try_ to make me think\r\nthe illness a real one; he throws off the mask at starting.\xe2\x80\x94Is it a\r\nnervous illness, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, aloud.\r\n\r\nThe captain answered by a solemn affirmative inclination of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have _two_ nervous sufferers in the house, Mr. Bygrave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94two. My wife and my niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is rather a strange coincidence of misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Very strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s resolution not to be offended, Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x99s exasperating insensibility to every stroke she aimed at him\r\nbegan to ruffle her. She was conscious of some little difficulty in\r\nsecuring her self-possession before she could say anything more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no immediate hope,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cof Miss Bygrave being able\r\nto leave her room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are satisfied, I suppose, with the medical attendance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no medical attendance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI watch\r\nthe case myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gathering venom in Mrs. Lecount swelled up at that reply, and\r\noverflowed at her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour smattering of science, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a malicious smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cincludes, I presume, a smattering of medicine as well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the captain, without the slightest\r\ndisturbance of face or manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI know as much of one as I do of the\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which he spoke those words left Mrs. Lecount but one\r\ndignified alternative. She rose to terminate the interview. The\r\ntemptation of the moment proved too much for her, and she could not\r\nresist casting the shadow of a threat over Captain Wragge at parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI defer thanking you, sir, for the manner in which you have received\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil I can pay my debt of obligation to some purpose.\r\nIn the meantime I am glad to infer, from the absence of a medical\r\nattendant in the house, that Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s illness is much less\r\nserious than I had supposed it to be when I came here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never contradict a lady, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the incorrigible captain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is your pleasure, when we next meet to think my niece quite\r\nwell, I shall bow resignedly to the expression of your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nthose words, he followed the housekeeper into the passage, and politely\r\nopened the door for her. \xe2\x80\x9cI mark the trick, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself,\r\nas he closed it again. \xe2\x80\x9cThe trump-card in your hand is a sight of my\r\nniece, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care you don\xe2\x80\x99t play it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned to the parlor, and composedly awaited the next event which\r\nwas likely to happen\xe2\x80\x94a visit from Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s master. In less than\r\nan hour results justified Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s anticipations, and Noel\r\nVanstone walked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain, cordially seizing his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreluctant hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI know what you have come for. Mrs. Lecount has told\r\nyou of her visit here, and has no doubt declared that my niece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillness is a mere subterfuge. You feel surprised\xe2\x80\x94you feel hurt\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nsuspect me of trifling with your kind sympathies\xe2\x80\x94in short, you require\r\nan explanation. That explanation you shall have. Take a seat. Mr.\r\nVanstone. I am about to throw myself on your sense and judgment as a\r\nman of the world. I acknowledge that we are in a false position, sir;\r\nand I tell you plainly at the outset\xe2\x80\x94your housekeeper is the cause of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor once in his life, Noel Vanstone opened his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cLecount!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, in the utmost bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I offended Mrs.\r\nLecount, when she came here this morning, by a want of cordiality in my\r\nmanner. I am a plain man, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t assume what I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel. Far be\r\nit from me to breathe a word against your housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s character. She\r\nis, no doubt, a most excellent and trustworthy woman, but she has one\r\nserious failing common to persons at her time of life who occupy her\r\nsituation\xe2\x80\x94she is jealous of her influence over her master, although you\r\nmay not have observed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Noel Vanstone; \xe2\x80\x9cmy observation is\r\nremarkably quick. Nothing escapes me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot fail to have\r\nnoticed that Mrs. Lecount has allowed her jealousy to affect her\r\nconduct toward my niece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone thought of the domestic passage at arms between Mrs.\r\nLecount and himself when his guests of the evening had left Sea View,\r\nand failed to see his way to any direct reply. He expressed the utmost\r\nsurprise and distress\xe2\x80\x94he thought Lecount had done her best to be\r\nagreeable on the drive to Dunwich\xe2\x80\x94he hoped and trusted there was some\r\nunfortunate mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the captain, severely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nhave not noticed the circumstance yourself? As a man of honor and a man\r\nof observation, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that! Your housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s superficial\r\ncivility has not hidden your housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s real feeling. My niece has\r\nseen it, and so have you, and so have I. My niece, Mr. Vanstone, is a\r\nsensitive, high-spirited girl; and she has positively declined to\r\ncultivate Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s society for the future. Don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand\r\nme! To my niece as well as to myself, the attraction of _your_ society,\r\nMr. Vanstone, remains the same. Miss Bygrave simply declines to be an\r\napple of discord (if you will permit the classical allusion) cast into\r\nyour household. I think she is right so far, and I frankly confess that\r\nI have exaggerated a nervous indisposition, from which she is really\r\nsuffering, into a serious illness\xe2\x80\x94purely and entirely to prevent these\r\ntwo ladies for the present from meeting every day on the Parade, and\r\nfrom carrying unpleasant impressions of each other into your domestic\r\nestablishment and mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI allow nothing unpleasant in _my_ establishment,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Noel\r\nVanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m master\xe2\x80\x94you must have noticed that already, Mr.\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt of it, my dear sir. But to live morning, noon, and night in\r\nthe perpetual exercise of your authority is more like the life of a\r\ngovernor of a prison than the life of a master of a household. The wear\r\nand tear\xe2\x80\x94consider the wear and tear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes you in that light, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, soothed by\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s ready recognition of his authority. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not right. But I must take some steps directly. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be made\r\nridiculous\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll send Lecount away altogether, sooner than be made\r\nridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d His color rose, and he folded his little arms fiercely.\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s artfully irritating explanation had awakened that\r\ndormant suspicion of his housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s influence over him which\r\nhabitually lay hidden in his mind, and which Mrs. Lecount was now not\r\npresent to charm back to repose as usual. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must Miss Bygrave think\r\nof me!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a sudden outburst of vexation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send\r\nLecount away. Damme, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send Lecount away on the spot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, whose interest it was to avoid driving\r\nMrs. Lecount to any desperate extremities. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy take strong measures\r\nwhen mild measures will do? Mrs. Lecount is an old servant; Mrs.\r\nLecount is attached and useful. She has this little drawback of\r\njealousy\xe2\x80\x94jealousy of her domestic position with her bachelor master.\r\nShe sees you paying courteous attention to a handsome young lady; she\r\nsees that young lady properly sensible of your politeness; and, poor\r\nsoul, she loses her temper! What is the obvious remedy? Humor her\xe2\x80\x94make\r\na manly concession to the weaker sex. If Mrs. Lecount is with you, the\r\nnext time we meet on the Parade, walk the other way. If Mrs. Lecount is\r\nnot with you, give us the pleasure of your company by all means. In\r\nshort, my dear sir, try the _suaviter in modo_ (as we classical men\r\nsay) before you commit yourself to the _fortiter in re!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThere was one excellent reason why Noel Vanstone should take Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x99s conciliatory advice. An open rupture with Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x94even if\r\nhe could have summoned the courage to face it\xe2\x80\x94would imply the\r\nrecognition of her claims to a provision, in acknowledgment of the\r\nservices she had rendered to his father and to himself. His sordid\r\nnature quailed within him at the bare prospect of expressing the\r\nemotion of gratitude in a pecuniary form; and, after first consulting\r\nappearances by a show of hesitation, he consented to adopt the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, and to humor Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must be considered in this matter,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nconcession to Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s weakness must not be misunderstood. Miss\r\nBygrave must not be allowed to suppose I am afraid of my housekeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain declared that no such idea ever had entered, or ever could\r\nenter, Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Noel Vanstone returned to the subject\r\nnevertheless, again and again, with his customary pertinacity. Would it\r\nbe indiscreet if he asked leave to set himself right personally with\r\nMiss Bygrave? Was there any hope that he might have the happiness of\r\nseeing her on that day? or, if not, on the next day? or if not, on the\r\nday after? Captain Wragge answered cautiously: he felt the importance\r\nof not rousing Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s distrust by too great an alacrity in\r\ncomplying with his wishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn interview to-day, my dear sir, is out of the question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not well enough; she wants repose. To-morrow I propose taking\r\nher out before the heat of the day begins\xe2\x80\x94not merely to avoid\r\nembarrassment, after what has happened with Mrs. Lecount, but because\r\nthe morning air and the morning quiet are essential in these nervous\r\ncases. We are early people here\xe2\x80\x94we shall start at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. If you\r\nare early, too, and if you would like to join us, I need hardly say\r\nthat we can feel no objection to your company on our morning walk. The\r\nhour, I am aware, is an unusual one\xe2\x80\x94but later in the day my niece may\r\nbe resting on the sofa, and may not be able to see visitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving made this proposal purely for the purpose of enabling Noel\r\nVanstone to escape to North Shingles at an hour in the morning when his\r\nhousekeeper would be probably in bed, Captain Wragge left him to take\r\nthe hint, if he could, as indirectly as it had been given. He proved\r\nsharp enough (the case being one in which his own interests were\r\nconcerned) to close with the proposal on the spot. Politely declaring\r\nthat he was always an early man when the morning presented any special\r\nattraction to him, he accepted the appointment for seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and\r\nrose soon afterward to take his leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word at parting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cThis conversation is\r\nentirely between ourselves. Mrs. Lecount must know nothing of the\r\nimpression she has produced on my niece. I have only mentioned it to\r\nyou to account for my apparently churlish conduct and to satisfy your\r\nown mind. In confidence, Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94strictly in confidence.\r\nGood-morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these parting words, the captain bowed his visitor out. Unless\r\nsome unexpected disaster occurred, he now saw his way safely to the end\r\nof the enterprise. He had gained two important steps in advance that\r\nmorning. He had sown the seeds of variance between the housekeeper and\r\nher master, and he had given Noel Vanstone a common interest with\r\nMagdalen and himself, in keeping a secret from Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\ncaught our man,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Captain Wragge, cheerfully rubbing his\r\nhands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe have caught our man at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn leaving North Shingles Noel Vanstone walked straight home, fully\r\nrestored to his place in his own estimation, and sternly determined to\r\ncarry matters with a high hand if he found himself in collision with\r\nMrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper received her master at the door with her mildest manner\r\nand her gentlest smile. She addressed him with downcast eyes; she\r\nopposed to his contemplated assertion of independence a barrier of\r\nimpenetrable respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I venture to ask, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cif your visit to North\r\nShingles has led you to form the same conclusion as mine on the subject\r\nof Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s illness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not, Lecount. I consider your conclusion to have been both\r\nhasty and prejudiced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear it, sir. I felt hurt by Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s rude\r\nreception of me, but I was not aware that my judgment was prejudiced by\r\nit. Perhaps he received _you_, sir, with a warmer welcome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe received me like a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94that is all I think it necessary to\r\nsay, Lecount\xe2\x80\x94he received me like a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis answer satisfied Mrs. Lecount on the one doubtful point that had\r\nperplexed her. Whatever Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s sudden coolness toward herself\r\nmight mean, his polite reception of her master implied that the risk of\r\ndetection had not daunted him, and that the plot was still in full\r\nprogress. The housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s eyes brightened; she had expressly\r\ncalculated on this result. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thinking, she addressed her\r\nmaster with another question: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will probably visit Mr. Bygrave\r\nagain, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I shall visit him\xe2\x80\x94if I please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps see Miss Bygrave, if she gets better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I should be glad to know why not? Is it necessary to ask your\r\nleave first, Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means, sir. As you have often said (and as I have often agreed\r\nwith you), you are master. It may surprise you to hear it, Mr. Noel,\r\nbut I have a private reason for wishing that you should see Miss\r\nBygrave again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Noel started a little, and looked at his housekeeper with some\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a strange fancy of my own, sir, about that young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nproceeded Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will excuse my fancy, and indulge it,\r\nyou will do me a favor for which I shall be very grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fancy?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated her master, in growing surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat fancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nShe took from one of the neat little pockets of her apron a morsel of\r\nnote-paper, carefully folded into the smallest possible compass, and\r\nrespectfully placed it in Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are willing to oblige an old and faithful servant, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, in a very quiet and very impressive manner, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will kindly\r\nput that morsel of paper into your waistcoat pocket; you will open and\r\nread it, for the first time, _when you are next in Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany_, and you will say nothing of what has now passed between us to\r\nany living creature, from this time to that. I promise to explain my\r\nstrange request, sir, when you have done what I ask, and when your next\r\ninterview with Miss Bygrave has come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe courtesied with her best grace, and quietly left the room.\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone looked from the folded paper to the door, and from the\r\ndoor back to the folded paper, in unutterable astonishment. A mystery\r\nin his own house! under his own nose! What did it mean?\r\n\r\nIt meant that Mrs. Lecount had not wasted her time that morning. While\r\nthe captain was casting the net over his visitor at North Shingles, the\r\nhousekeeper was steadily mining the ground under his feet. The folded\r\npaper contained nothing less than a carefully written extract from the\r\npersonal description of Magdalen in Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s letter. With a daring\r\ningenuity which even Captain Wragge might have envied, Mrs. Lecount had\r\nfound her instrument for exposing the conspiracy in the unsuspecting\r\nperson of the victim himself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLate that evening, when Magdalen and Mrs. Wragge came back from their\r\nwalk in the dark, the captain stopped Magdalen on her way upstairs to\r\ninform her of the proceedings of the day. He added the expression of\r\nhis opinion that the time had come for bringing Noel Vanstone, with the\r\nleast possible delay, to the point of making a proposal. She merely\r\nanswered that she understood him, and that she would do what was\r\nrequired of her. Captain Wragge requested her in that case to oblige\r\nhim by joining a walking excursion in Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s company at\r\nseven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning. \xe2\x80\x9cI will be ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthere anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d There was nothing more. Magdalen bade him\r\ngood-night and returned to her own room.\r\n\r\nShe had shown the same disinclination to remain any longer than was\r\nnecessary in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s company throughout the three days of her\r\nseclusion in the house.\r\n\r\nDuring all that time, instead of appearing to weary of Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsociety, she had patiently, almost eagerly, associated herself with her\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s one absorbing pursuit. She who had often chafed and fretted\r\nin past days under the monotony of her life in the freedom of\r\nCombe-Raven, now accepted without a murmur the monotony of her life at\r\nMrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s work-table. She who had hated the sight of her needle and\r\nthread in old times\xe2\x80\x94who had never yet worn an article of dress of her\r\nown making\xe2\x80\x94now toiled as anxiously over the making of Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngown, and bore as patiently with Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s blunders, as if the sole\r\nobject of her existence had been the successful completion of that one\r\ndress. Anything was welcome to her\xe2\x80\x94the trivial difficulties of fitting\r\na gown: the small, ceaseless chatter of the poor half-witted creature\r\nwho was so proud of her assistance, and so happy in her\r\ncompany\xe2\x80\x94anything was welcome that shut her out from the coming future,\r\nfrom the destiny to which she stood self-condemned. That sorely-wounded\r\nnature was soothed by such a trifle now as the grasp of her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrough and friendly hand\xe2\x80\x94that desolate heart was cheered, when night\r\nparted them, by Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s kiss.\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s isolated position in the house produced no depressing\r\neffect on the captain\xe2\x80\x99s easy and equal spirits. Instead of resenting\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s systematic avoidance of his society, he looked to results,\r\nand highly approved of it. The more she neglected him for his wife the\r\nmore directly useful she became in the character of Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself-appointed guardian. He had more than once seriously contemplated\r\nrevoking the concession which had been extorted from him, and removing\r\nhis wife, at his own sole responsibility, out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way; and he had\r\nonly abandoned the idea on discovering that Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to\r\nkeep Mrs. Wragge in her own company was really serious. While the two\r\nwere together, his main anxiety was set at rest. They kept their door\r\nlocked by his own desire while he was out of the house, and, whatever\r\nMrs. Wragge might do, Magdalen was to be trusted not to open it until\r\nhe came back. That night Captain Wragge enjoyed his cigar with a mind\r\nat ease, and sipped his brandy-and-water in happy ignorance of the\r\npitfall which Mrs. Lecount had prepared for him in the morning.\r\n\r\nPunctually at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Noel Vanstone made his appearance. The\r\nmoment he entered the room Captain Wragge detected a change in his\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s look and manner. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhave not done with Mrs. Lecount yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Miss Bygrave this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cWell enough,\r\nI hope, for our early walk?\xe2\x80\x9d His half-closed eyes, weak and watery with\r\nthe morning light and the morning air, looked about the room furtively,\r\nand he shifted his place in a restless manner from one chair to\r\nanother, as he made those polite inquiries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy niece is better\xe2\x80\x94she is dressing for the walk,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain,\r\nsteadily observing his restless little friend while he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nVanstone!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, on a sudden, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a plain Englishman\xe2\x80\x94excuse my\r\nblunt way of speaking my mind. You don\xe2\x80\x99t meet me this morning as\r\ncordially as you met me yesterday. There is something unsettled in your\r\nface. I distrust that housekeeper of yours, sir! Has she been presuming\r\non your forbearance? Has she been trying to poison your mind against me\r\nor my niece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Noel Vanstone had obeyed Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions, and had kept\r\nher little morsel of note-paper folded in his pocket until the time\r\ncame to use it, Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s designedly blunt appeal might not have\r\nfound him unprepared with an answer. But curiosity had got the better\r\nof him; he had opened the note at night, and again in the morning; it\r\nhad seriously perplexed and startled him; and it had left his mind far\r\ntoo disturbed to allow him the possession of his ordinary resources. He\r\nhesitated; and his answer, when he succeeded in making it, began with a\r\nprevarication.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge stopped him before he had got beyond his first sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, in his loftiest manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nhave secrets to keep, you have only to say so, and I have done. I\r\nintrude on no man\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. At the same time, Mr. Vanstone, you must\r\nallow me to recall to your memory that I met you yesterday without any\r\nreserves on my side. I admitted you to my frankest and fullest\r\nconfidence, sir\xe2\x80\x94and, highly as I prize the advantages of your society,\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t consent to cultivate your friendship on any other than equal\r\nterms.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw open his respectable frock-coat and surveyed his\r\nvisitor with a manly and virtuous severity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean no offense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, piteously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you\r\ninterrupt me, Mr. Bygrave? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you let me explain? I mean no\r\noffense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo offense is taken, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a perfect right\r\nto the exercise of your own discretion. I am not offended\xe2\x80\x94I only claim\r\nfor myself the same privilege which I accord to you.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose with\r\ngreat dignity and rang the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cTell Miss Bygrave,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the\r\nservant, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our walk this morning is put off until another\r\nopportunity, and that I won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble her to come downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis strong proceeding had the desired effect. Noel Vanstone vehemently\r\npleaded for a moment\xe2\x80\x99s private conversation before the message was\r\ndelivered. Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s severity partially relaxed. He sent the\r\nservant downstairs again, and, resuming his chair, waited confidently\r\nfor results. In calculating the facilities for practicing on his\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s weakness, he had one great superiority over Mrs. Lecount. His\r\njudgment was not warped by latent female jealousies, and he avoided the\r\nerror into which the housekeeper had fallen, self-deluded\xe2\x80\x94the error of\r\nunderrating the impression on Noel Vanstone that Magdalen had produced.\r\nOne of the forces in this world which no middle-aged woman is capable\r\nof estimating at its full value, when it acts against her, is the force\r\nof beauty in a woman younger than herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so hasty, Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t give me time\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t wait\r\nand hear what I have to say!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, piteously, when the\r\nservant had closed the parlor door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy family failing, sir\xe2\x80\x94the blood of the Bygraves. Accept my excuses.\r\nWe are alone, as you wished; pray proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlaced between the alternatives of losing Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s society or\r\nbetraying Mrs. Lecount, unenlightened by any suspicion of the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate object, cowed by the immovable scrutiny of\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s inquiring eye, Noel Vanstone was not long in making\r\nhis choice. He confusedly described his singular interview of the\r\nprevious evening with Mrs. Lecount, and, taking the folded paper from\r\nhis pocket, placed it in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nA suspicion of the truth dawned on Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s mind the moment he\r\nsaw the mysterious note. He withdrew to the window before he opened it.\r\nThe first lines that attracted his attention were these: \xe2\x80\x9cOblige me,\r\nMr. Noel, by comparing the young lady who is now in your company with\r\nthe personal description which follows these lines, and which has been\r\ncommunicated to me by a friend. You shall know the name of the person\r\ndescribed\xe2\x80\x94which I have left a blank\xe2\x80\x94as soon as the evidence of your own\r\neyes has forced you to believe what you would refuse to credit on the\r\nunsupported testimony of Virginie Lecount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was enough for the captain. Before he had read a word of the\r\ndescription itself, he knew what Mrs. Lecount had done, and felt, with\r\na profound sense of humiliation, that his female enemy had taken him by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to think; the whole enterprise was threatened with\r\nirrevocable overthrow. The one resource in Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\nsituation was to act instantly on the first impulse of his own\r\naudacity. Line by line he read on, and still the ready inventiveness\r\nwhich had never deserted him yet failed to answer the call made on it\r\nnow. He came to the closing sentence\xe2\x80\x94to the last words which mentioned\r\nthe two little moles on Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s neck. At that crowning point of the\r\ndescription, an idea crossed his mind; his party-colored eyes twinkled;\r\nhis curly lips twisted up at the corners; Wragge was himself again. He\r\nwheeled round suddenly from the window, and looked Noel Vanstone\r\nstraight in the face with a grimly-quiet suggestiveness of something\r\nserious to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, sir, do you happen to know anything of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA respectable family,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all I know. Why do\r\nyou ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not usually a betting man,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cBut on this\r\noccasion I will lay you any wager you like there is madness in your\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadness!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Noel Vanstone, amazedly\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadness!\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated the captain, sternly tapping the note with his\r\nforefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cI see the cunning of insanity, the suspicion of insanity,\r\nthe feline treachery of insanity in every line of this deplorable\r\ndocument. There is a far more alarming reason, sir, than I had supposed\r\nfor Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s behavior to my niece. It is clear to me that Miss\r\nBygrave resembles some other lady who has seriously offended your\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x94who has been formerly connected, perhaps, with an outbreak\r\nof insanity in your housekeeper\xe2\x80\x94and who is now evidently confused with\r\nmy niece in your housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s wandering mind. That is my conviction,\r\nMr. Vanstone. I may be right, or I may be wrong. All I say is\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94neither you, nor any man, can assign a sane motive for the\r\nproduction of that incomprehensible document, and for the use which you\r\nare requested to make of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s mad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, with a very blank\r\nlook, and a very discomposed manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have escaped me, with\r\nmy habits of observation; it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have escaped me if\r\nLecount had been mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, my dear sir. In my opinion, she is the subject of an insane\r\ndelusion. In your opinion, she is in possession of her senses, and has\r\nsome mysterious motive which neither you nor I can fathom. Either way,\r\nthere can be no harm in putting Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s description to the test,\r\nnot only as a matter of curiosity, but for our own private satisfaction\r\non both sides. It is of course impossible to tell my niece that she is\r\nto be made the subject of such a preposterous experiment as that note\r\nof yours suggests. But you can use your own eyes, Mr. Vanstone; you can\r\nkeep your own counsel; and\xe2\x80\x94mad or not\xe2\x80\x94you can at least tell your\r\nhousekeeper, on the testimony of your own senses, that she is wrong.\r\nLet me look at the description again. The greater part of it is not\r\nworth two straws for any purpose of identification; hundreds of young\r\nladies have tall figures, fair complexions, light brown hair, and light\r\ngray eyes. You will say, on the other hand, hundreds of young ladies\r\nhave not got two little moles close together on the left side of the\r\nneck. Quite true. The moles supply us with what we scientific men call\r\na Crucial Test. When my niece comes downstairs, sir, you have my full\r\npermission to take the liberty of looking at her neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone expressed his high approval of the Crucial Test by\r\nsmirking and simpering for the first time that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf looking at her neck,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the captain, returning the note to\r\nhis visitor, and then making for the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go upstairs myself,\r\nMr. Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand inspect Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s walking-dress.\r\nIf she has innocently placed any obstacles in your way, if her hair is\r\na little too low, or her frill is a little too high, I will exert my\r\nauthority, on the first harmless pretext I can think of, to have those\r\nobstacles removed. All I ask is, that you will choose your opportunity\r\ndiscreetly, and that you will not allow my niece to suppose that her\r\nneck is the object of a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s inspection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moment he was out of the parlor Captain Wragge ascended the stairs\r\nat the top of his speed and knocked at Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s door. She opened it\r\nto him in her walking-dress, obedient to the signal agreed on between\r\nthem which summoned her downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done with your paints and powders?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain,\r\nwithout wasting a word in preliminary explanations. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were not in\r\nthe box of costumes which I sold for you at Birmingham. Where are\r\nthey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got them here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you possibly mean\r\nby wanting them now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring them instantly into my dressing-room\xe2\x80\x94the whole collection,\r\nbrushes, palette, and everything. Don\xe2\x80\x99t waste time in asking questions;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what has happened as we go on. Every moment is precious\r\nto us. Follow me instantly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face plainly showed that there was a serious reason for his strange\r\nproposal. Magdalen secured her collection of cosmetics and followed him\r\ninto the dressing-room. He locked the door, placed her on a chair close\r\nto the light, and then told her what had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are on the brink of detection,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the captain, carefully\r\nmixing his colors with liquid glue, and with a strong \xe2\x80\x9cdrier\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nfrom a bottle in his own possession. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one chance for us\r\n(lift up your hair from the left side of your neck)\xe2\x80\x94I have told Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone to take a private opportunity of looking at you; and I am\r\ngoing to give the lie direct to that she-devil Lecount by painting out\r\nyour moles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t be painted out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cNo color will stop on\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ color will,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cI have tried a variety of\r\nprofessions in my time\xe2\x80\x94the profession of painting among the rest. Did\r\nyou ever hear of such a thing as a Black Eye? I lived some months once\r\nin the neighborhood of Drury Lane entirely on Black Eyes. My\r\nflesh-color stood on bruises of all sorts, shades, and sizes, and it\r\nwill stand, I promise you, on your moles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this assurance, the captain dipped his brush into a little lump of\r\nopaque color which he had mixed in a saucer, and which he had graduated\r\nas nearly as the materials would permit to the color of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nskin. After first passing a cambric handkerchief, with some white\r\npowder on it, over the part of her neck on which he designed to\r\noperate, he placed two layers of color on the moles with the tip of the\r\nbrush. The process was performed in a few moments, and the moles, as if\r\nby magic, disappeared from view. Nothing but the closest inspection\r\ncould have discovered the artifice by which they had been concealed; at\r\nthe distance of two or three feet only, it was perfectly invisible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait here five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, \xe2\x80\x9cto let the paint\r\ndry\xe2\x80\x94and then join us in the parlor. Mrs. Lecount herself would be\r\npuzzled if she looked at you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing you have not told me yet.\r\nHow did Mrs. Lecount get the description which you read downstairs?\r\nWhatever else she has seen of me, she has not seen the mark on my\r\nneck\xe2\x80\x94it is too far back, and too high up; my hair hides it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows of the mark?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\nShe turned deadly pale under the anguish of a sudden recollection of\r\nFrank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister knows it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lecount may have written to your sister,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the captain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think my sister would tell a stranger what no stranger has a\r\nright to know? Never! never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nobody else who could tell Mrs. Lecount? The mark was\r\nmentioned in the handbills at York. Who put it there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Norah! Perhaps Mr. Pendril. Perhaps Miss Garth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Mrs. Lecount has written to Mr. Pendril or Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x94more likely\r\nto Miss Garth. The governess would be easier to deal with than the\r\nlawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can she have said to Miss Garth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge considered a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say what Mrs. Lecount may have written,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\r\ntell you what I should have written in Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s place. I should\r\nhave frightened Miss Garth by false reports about you, to begin with,\r\nand then I should have asked for personal particulars, to help a\r\nbenevolent stranger in restoring you to your friends.\xe2\x80\x9d The angry\r\nglitter flashed up instantly in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _you_ would have done is what Mrs. Lecount has done,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nindignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither lawyer nor governess shall dispute my right to my\r\nown will and my own way. If Miss Garth thinks she can control my\r\nactions by corresponding with Mrs. Lecount, I will show Miss Garth she\r\nis mistaken! It is high time, Captain Wragge, to have done with these\r\nwretched risks of discovery. We will take the short way to the end we\r\nhave in view sooner than Mrs. Lecount or Miss Garth think for. How long\r\ncan you give me to wring an offer of marriage out of that creature\r\ndownstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare not give you long,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cNow your friends\r\nknow where you are, they may come down on us at a day\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Could\r\nyou manage it in a week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll manage it in half the time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a hard, defiant\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave us together this morning as you left us at Dunwich, and\r\ntake Mrs. Wragge with you, as an excuse for parting company. Is the\r\npaint dry yet? Go downstairs and tell him I am coming directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, for the second time, Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s well-meant efforts defeated their\r\nown end. So the fatal force of circumstance turned the hand that would\r\nfain have held Magdalen back into the hand that drove her on.\r\n\r\nThe captain returned to his visitor in the parlor, after first stopping\r\non his way to issue his orders for the walking excursion to Mrs.\r\nWragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am shocked to have kept you waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting down again\r\nconfidentially by Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cMy only excuse is, that my\r\nniece had accidentally dressed her hair so as to defeat our object. I\r\nhave been persuading her to alter it, and young ladies are apt to be a\r\nlittle obstinate on questions relating to their toilet. Give her a\r\nchair on that side of you when she comes in, and take your look at her\r\nneck comfortably before we start for our walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen entered the room as he said those words, and after the first\r\ngreetings were exchanged, took the chair presented to her with the most\r\nunsuspicious readiness. Noel Vanstone applied the Crucial Test on the\r\nspot, with the highest appreciation of the fair material which was the\r\nsubject of experiment. Not the vestige of a mole was visible on any\r\npart of the smooth white surface of Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s neck. It mutely\r\nanswered the blinking inquiry of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s half-closed eyes by\r\nthe flattest practical contradiction of Mrs. Lecount. That one central\r\nincident in the events of the morning was of all the incidents that had\r\nhitherto occurred, the most important in its results. That one\r\ndiscovery shook the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s hold on her master as nothing had\r\nshaken it yet.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Mrs. Wragge made her appearance, and excited as much\r\nsurprise in Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s mind as he was capable of feeling while\r\nabsorbed in the enjoyment of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s society. The walking-party left\r\nthe house at once, directing their steps northward, so as not to pass\r\nthe windows of Sea-view Cottage. To Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s unutterable\r\nastonishment, her husband, for the first time in the course of their\r\nmarried life, politely offered her his arm, and led her on in advance\r\nof the young people, as if the privilege of walking alone with her\r\npresented some special attraction to him! \xe2\x80\x9cStep out!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the\r\ncaptain, fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave your niece and Mr. Vanstone alone! If I catch\r\nyou looking back at them, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put the Oriental Cashmere Robe on the\r\ntop of the kitchen fire! Turn your toes out, and keep step\xe2\x80\x94confound\r\nyou, keep step!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Wragge kept step to the best of her limited\r\nability. Her sturdy knees trembled under her. She firmly believed the\r\ncaptain was intoxicated.\r\n\r\nThe walk lasted for rather more than an hour. Before nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock they\r\nwere all back again at North Shingles. The ladies went at once into the\r\nhouse. Noel Vanstone remained with Captain Wragge in the garden.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think now of Mrs. Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn Lecount!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noel Vanstone, in great agitation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m half\r\ninclined to agree with you. I\xe2\x80\x99m half inclined to think my infernal\r\nhousekeeper is mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke fretfully and unwillingly, as if the merest allusion to Mrs.\r\nLecount was distasteful to him. His color came and went; his manner was\r\nabsent and undecided; he fidgeted restlessly about the garden walk. It\r\nwould have been plain to a far less acute observation than Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x99s, that Magdalen had met his advances by an unexpected grace and\r\nreadiness of encouragement which had entirely overthrown his\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never enjoyed a walk so much in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a\r\nsudden outburst of enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope Miss Bygrave feels all the\r\nbetter, for it. Do you go out at the same time to-morrow morning? May I\r\njoin you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means, Mr. Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, cordially. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me\r\nfor returning to the subject\xe2\x80\x94but what do you propose saying to Mrs.\r\nLecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Lecount is a perfect nuisance! What would you do, Mr.\r\nBygrave, if you were in my place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to ask a question, my dear sir, before I tell you. What is\r\nyour breakfast-hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mrs. Lecount an early riser?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Lecount is lazy in the morning. I hate lazy women! If you were in\r\nmy place, what should you say to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cI should return at\r\nonce by the back way; I should let Mrs. Lecount see me in the front\r\ngarden as if I was taking a turn before breakfast; and I should leave\r\nher to suppose that I was only just out of my room. If she asks you\r\nwhether you mean to come here today, say No. Secure a quiet life until\r\ncircumstances force you to give her an answer. Then tell the plain\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94say that Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s niece and Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s description are\r\nat variance with each other in the most important particular, and beg\r\nthat the subject may not be mentioned again. There is my advice. What\r\ndo you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Noel Vanstone could have looked into his counselor\xe2\x80\x99s mind, he might\r\nhave thought the captain\xe2\x80\x99s advice excellently adapted to serve the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s interests. As long as Mrs. Lecount could be kept in ignorance\r\nof her master\xe2\x80\x99s visits to North Shingles, so long she would wait until\r\nthe opportunity came for trying her experiment, and so long she might\r\nbe trusted not to endanger the conspiracy by any further proceedings.\r\nNecessarily incapable of viewing Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s advice under this\r\naspect, Noel Vanstone simply looked at it as offering him a temporary\r\nmeans of escape from an explanation with his housekeeper. He eagerly\r\ndeclared that the course of action suggested to him should be followed\r\nto the letter, and returned to Sea View without further delay.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s anticipations were in no respect\r\nfalsified by Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s conduct. She had no suspicion of her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s visit to North Shingles: she had made up her mind, if\r\nnecessary, to wait patiently for his interview with Miss Bygrave until\r\nthe end of the week; and she did not embarrass him by any unexpected\r\nquestions when he announced his intention of holding no personal\r\ncommunication with the Bygraves on that day. All she said was, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou feel well enough, Mr. Noel? or don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel inclined?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nanswered, shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel well enough\xe2\x80\x9d; and there the\r\nconversation ended.\r\n\r\nThe next day the proceedings of the previous morning were exactly\r\nrepeated. This time Noel Vanstone went home rapturously with a keepsake\r\nin his breast-pocket; he had taken tender possession of one of Miss\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x99s gloves. At intervals during the day, whenever he was alone,\r\nhe took out the glove and kissed it with a devotion which was almost\r\npassionate in its fervor. The miserable little creature luxuriated in\r\nhis moments of stolen happiness with a speechless and stealthy delight\r\nwhich was a new sensation to him. The few young girls whom he had met\r\nwith, in his father\xe2\x80\x99s narrow circle at Zurich, had felt a mischievous\r\npleasure in treating him like a quaint little plaything; the strongest\r\nimpression he could make on their hearts was an impression in which\r\ntheir lap-dogs might have rivaled him; the deepest interest he could\r\ncreate in them was the interest they might have felt in a new trinket\r\nor a new dress. The only women who had hitherto invited his admiration,\r\nand taken his compliments seriously had been women whose charms were on\r\nthe wane, and whose chances of marriage were fast failing them. For the\r\nfirst time in his life he had now passed hours of happiness in the\r\nsociety of a beautiful girl, who had left him to think of her afterward\r\nwithout a single humiliating remembrance to lower him in his own\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nAnxiously as he tried to hide it, the change produced in his look and\r\nmanner by the new feeling awakened in him was not a change which could\r\nbe concealed from Mrs. Lecount. On the second day she pointedly asked\r\nhim whether he had not made an arrangement to call on the Bygraves. He\r\ndenied it as before. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are going to-morrow, Mr. Noel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npersisted the housekeeper. He was at the end of his resources; he was\r\nimpatient to be rid of her inquiries; he trusted to his friend at North\r\nShingles to help him; and this time he answered Yes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you see the\r\nyoung lady,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t forget that note of mine,\r\nsir, which you have in your waistcoat-pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d No more was said on\r\neither side, but by that night\xe2\x80\x99s post the housekeeper wrote to Miss\r\nGarth. The letter merely acknowledged, with thanks, the receipt of Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s communication, and informed her that in a few days Mrs. Lecount\r\nhoped to be in a position to write again and summon Mr. Pendril to\r\nAldborough.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening, when the parlor at North Shingles began to get\r\ndark, and when the captain rang the bell for candles as usual, he was\r\nsurprised by hearing Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s voice in the passage telling the\r\nservant to take the lights downstairs again. She knocked at the door\r\nimmediately afterward, and glided into the obscurity of the room like a\r\nghost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a question to ask you about your plans for to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes are very weak this evening, and I hope you will not\r\nobject to dispense with the candles for a few minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke in low, stifled tones, and felt her way noiselessly to a\r\nchair far removed from the captain in the darkest part of the room.\r\nSitting near the window, he could just discern the dim outline of her\r\ndress, he could just hear the faint accents of her voice. For the last\r\ntwo days he had seen nothing of her except during their morning walk.\r\nOn that afternoon he had found his wife crying in the little backroom\r\ndown-stairs. She could only tell him that Magdalen had frightened\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94that Magdalen was going the way again which she had gone when the\r\nletter came from China in the terrible past time at Vauxhall Walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sorry to hear that you were ill to-day, from Mrs. Wragge,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe captain, unconsciously dropping his voice almost to a whisper as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered quietly, out of the darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nstrong enough to suffer, and live. Other girls in my place would have\r\nbeen happier\xe2\x80\x94they would have suffered, and died. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter; it\r\nwill be all the same a hundred years hence. Is he coming again tomorrow\r\nmorning at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is coming, if you feel no objection to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no objection to make; I have done with objecting. But I should\r\nlike to have the time altered. I don\xe2\x80\x99t look my best in the early\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94-I have bad nights, and I rise haggard and worn. Write him a\r\nnote this evening, and tell him to come at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve is rather late, under the circumstances, for you to be seen out\r\nwalking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no intention of walking. Let him be shown into the parlor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice died away in silence before she ended the sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd leave me alone in the parlor to receive him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAn admirable idea. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be out of\r\nthe way in the dining-room while he is here, and you can come and tell\r\nme about it when he has gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another moment of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no way but telling you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can control\r\nmyself while he is with me, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer for what I may say or do\r\nafterward. Is there no other way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of ways,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the first that occurs to\r\nme. Leave the blind down over the window of your room upstairs before\r\nhe comes. I will go out on the beach, and wait there within sight of\r\nthe house. When I see him come out again, I will look at the window. If\r\nhe has said nothing, leave the blind down. If he has made you an offer,\r\ndraw the blind up. The signal is simplicity itself; we can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmisunderstand each other. Look your best to-morrow! Make sure of him,\r\nmy dear girl\xe2\x80\x94make sure of him, if you possibly can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken loud enough to feel certain that she had heard him, but\r\nno answering word came from her. The dead silence was only disturbed by\r\nthe rustling of her dress, which told him she had risen from her chair.\r\nHer shadowy presence crossed the room again; the door shut softly; she\r\nwas gone. He rang the bell hurriedly for the lights. The servant found\r\nhim standing close at the window, looking less self-possessed than\r\nusual. He told her he felt a little poorly, and sent her to the\r\ncupboard for the brandy.\r\n\r\nAt a few minutes before twelve the next day Captain Wragge withdrew to\r\nhis post of observation, concealing himself behind a fishing-boat drawn\r\nup on the beach. Punctually as the hour struck, he saw Noel Vanstone\r\napproach North Shingles and open the garden gate. When the house door\r\nhad closed on the visitor, Captain Wragge settled himself comfortably\r\nagainst the side of the boat and lit his cigar.\r\n\r\nHe smoked for half an hour\xe2\x80\x94for ten minutes over the half-hour, by his\r\nwatch. He finished the cigar down to the last morsel of it that he\r\ncould hold in his lips. Just as he had thrown away the end, the door\r\nopened again and Noel Vanstone came out.\r\n\r\nThe captain looked up instantly at Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s window. In the absorbing\r\nexcitement of the moment, he counted the seconds. She might get from\r\nthe parlor to her own room in less than a minute. He counted to thirty,\r\nand nothing happened. He counted to fifty, and nothing happened. He\r\ngave up counting, and left the boat impatiently, to return to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAs he took his first step forward he saw the signal.\r\n\r\nThe blind was drawn up.\r\n\r\nCautiously ascending the eminence of the beach, Captain Wragge looked\r\ntoward Sea-view Cottage before he showed himself on the Parade. Noel\r\nVanstone had reached home again; he was just entering his own door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all your money was offered me to stand in your shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncaptain, looking after him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crich as you are, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the house, Captain Wragge received a significant\r\nmessage from the servant. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Noel Vanstone would call again at two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock that afternoon, when he hoped to have the pleasure of finding\r\nMr. Bygrave at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s first inquiry after hearing this message referred to\r\nMagdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere was Miss Bygrave?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn her own room.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere was Mrs.\r\nBygrave?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn the back parlor.\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Wragge turned his steps at once\r\nin the latter direction, and found his wife, for the second time, in\r\ntears. She had been sent out of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s room for the whole day, and\r\nshe was at her wits\xe2\x80\x99 end to know what she had done to deserve it.\r\nShortening her lamentations without ceremony, her husband sent her\r\nupstairs on the spot, with instructions to knock at the door, and to\r\ninquire whether Magdalen could give five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 attention to a\r\nquestion of importance which must be settled before two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nThe answer returned was in the negative. Magdalen requested that the\r\nsubject on which she was asked to decide might be mentioned to her in\r\nwriting. She engaged to reply in the same way, on the understanding\r\nthat Mrs. Wragge, and not the servant, should be employed to deliver\r\nthe note and to take back the answer.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge forthwith opened his paper-case and wrote these lines:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept my warmest congratulations on the result of your interview with\r\nMr. N. V. He is coming again at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94no doubt to make his\r\nproposals in due form. The question to decide is, whether I shall press\r\nhim or not on the subject of settlements. The considerations for your\r\nown mind are two in number. First, whether the said pressure (without\r\nat all underrating your influence over him) may not squeeze for a long\r\ntime before it squeezes money out of Mr. N. V. Secondly, whether we are\r\naltogether justified\xe2\x80\x94considering our present position toward a certain\r\nsharp practitioner in petticoats\xe2\x80\x94in running the risk of delay. Consider\r\nthese points, and let me have your decision as soon as convenient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer returned to this note was written in crooked, blotted\r\ncharacters, strangely unlike Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s usually firm and clear\r\nhandwriting. It only contained these words: \xe2\x80\x9cGive yourself no trouble\r\nabout settlements. Leave the use to which he is to put his money for\r\nthe future in my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain, when his wife had delivered the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, with a fresh burst of tears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut she only\r\nopened the door far enough to put out her hand. I took and gave it a\r\nlittle squeeze\xe2\x80\x94and, oh poor soul, it felt so cold in mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s master made his appearance at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he stood\r\nalarmingly in need of an anodyne application from Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s green\r\nfan. The agitation of making his avowal to Magdalen; the terror of\r\nfinding himself discovered by the housekeeper; the tormenting suspicion\r\nof the hard pecuniary conditions which Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s relative and guardian\r\nmight impose on him\xe2\x80\x94all these emotions, stirring in conflict together,\r\nhad overpowered his feebly-working heart with a trial that strained it\r\nsorely. He gasped for breath as he sat down in the parlor at North\r\nShingles, and that ominous bluish pallor which always overspread his\r\nface in moments of agitation now made its warning appearance again.\r\nCaptain Wragge seized the brandy bottle in genuine alarm, and forced\r\nhis visitor to drink a wine-glassful of the spirit before a word was\r\nsaid between them on either side.\r\n\r\nRestored by the stimulant, and encouraged by the readiness with which\r\nthe captain anticipated everything that he had to say, Noel Vanstone\r\ncontrived to state the serious object of his visit in tolerably plain\r\nterms. All the conventional preliminaries proper to the occasion were\r\neasily disposed of. The suitor\xe2\x80\x99s family was respectable; his position\r\nin life was undeniably satisfactory; his attachment, though hasty, was\r\nevidently disinterested and sincere. All that Captain Wragge had to do\r\nwas to refer to these various considerations with a happy choice of\r\nlanguage in a voice that trembled with manly emotion, and this he did\r\nto perfection. For the first half-hour of the interview, no allusion\r\nwhatever was made to the delicate and dangerous part of the subject.\r\nThe captain waited until he had composed his visitor, and when that\r\nresult was achieved came smoothly to the point in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one little difficulty, Mr. Vanstone, which I think we have\r\nboth overlooked. Your housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s recent conduct inclines me to fear\r\nthat she will view the approaching change in your life with anything\r\nbut a friendly eye. Probably you have not thought it necessary yet to\r\ninform her of the new tie which you propose to form?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone turned pale at the bare idea of explaining himself to\r\nMrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell what I\xe2\x80\x99m to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, glancing aside nervously at the\r\nwindow, as if he expected to see the housekeeper peeping in. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate\r\nall awkward positions, and this is the most unpleasant position I ever\r\nwas placed in. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a terrible woman Lecount is. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nafraid of her; pray don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words his fears rose in his throat, and gave him the lie\r\ndirect by stopping his utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to explain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, coming\r\nto the rescue. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the common story, Mr. Vanstone. Here is a woman\r\nwho has grown old in your service, and in your father\xe2\x80\x99s service before\r\nyou; a woman who has contrived, in all sorts of small, underhand ways,\r\nto presume systematically on her position for years and years past; a\r\nwoman, in short, whom your inconsiderate but perfectly natural kindness\r\nhas allowed to claim a right of property in you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProperty!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, mistaking the captain, and letting the\r\ntruth escape him through sheer inability to conceal his fears any\r\nlonger. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what amount of property she won\xe2\x80\x99t claim. She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake me pay for my father as well as for myself. Thousands, Mr.\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x94thousands of pounds sterling out of my pocket!!!\xe2\x80\x9d He clasped\r\nhis hands in despair at the picture of pecuniary compulsion which his\r\nfancy had conjured up\xe2\x80\x94his own golden life-blood spouting from him in\r\ngreat jets of prodigality, under the lancet of Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94gently! The woman knows nothing so far, and the\r\nmoney is not gone yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; the money is not gone, as you say. I\xe2\x80\x99m only nervous about it;\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t help being nervous. You were saying something just now; you\r\nwere going to give me advice. I value your advice; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nhighly I value your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d He said those words with a conciliatory\r\nsmile which was more than helpless; it was absolutely servile in its\r\ndependence on his judicious friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only assuring you, my dear sir, that I understood your\r\nposition,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI see your difficulty as plainly as you\r\ncan see it yourself. Tell a woman like Mrs. Lecount that she must come\r\noff her domestic throne, to make way for a young and beautiful\r\nsuccessor, armed with the authority of a wife, and an unpleasant scene\r\nmust be the inevitable result. An unpleasant scene, Mr. Vanstone, if\r\nyour opinion of your housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s sanity is well founded. Something\r\nfar more serious, if my opinion that her intellect is unsettled happens\r\nto turn out the right one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my opinion, too,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Noel Vanstone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially after what has happened to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge immediately begged to know what the event alluded to\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone thereupon explained\xe2\x80\x94with an infinite number of\r\nparentheses all referring to himself\xe2\x80\x94that Mrs. Lecount had put the\r\ndreaded question relating to the little note in her master\xe2\x80\x99s pocket\r\nbarely an hour since. He had answered her inquiry as Mr. Bygrave had\r\nadvised him. On hearing that the accuracy of the personal description\r\nhad been fairly put to the test, and had failed in the one important\r\nparticular of the moles on the neck, Mrs. Lecount had considered a\r\nlittle, and had then asked him whether he had shown her note to Mr.\r\nBygrave before the experiment was tried. He had answered in the\r\nnegative, as the only safe form of reply that he could think of on the\r\nspur of the moment, and the housekeeper had then addressed him in these\r\nstrange and startling words: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are keeping the truth from me, Mr.\r\nNoel. You are trusting strangers, and doubting your old servant and\r\nyour old friend. Every time you go to Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s house, every time\r\nyou see Miss Bygrave, you are drawing nearer and nearer to your\r\ndestruction. They have got the bandage over your eyes in spite of me;\r\nbut I tell them, and tell you, before many days are over I will take it\r\noff!\xe2\x80\x9d To this extraordinary outbreak\xe2\x80\x94accompanied as it was by an\r\nexpression in Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s face which he had never seen there\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94Noel Vanstone had made no reply. Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s conviction that\r\nthere was a lurking taint of insanity in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s blood had\r\nrecurred to his memory, and he had left the room at the first\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge listened with the closest attention to the narrative\r\nthus presented to him. But one conclusion could be drawn from it\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\na plain warning to him to hasten the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cto hear that you are inclining\r\nmore favorably to my opinion. After what you have just told me, Mr.\r\nVanstone, no sensible man could do otherwise. This is becoming serious.\r\nI hardly know what results may not be expected to follow the\r\ncommunication of your approaching change in life to Mrs. Lecount. My\r\nniece may be involved in those results. She is nervous; she is\r\nsensitive in the highest degree; she is the innocent object of this\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s unreasoning hatred and distrust. You alarm me, sir! I am not\r\neasily thrown off my balance, but I acknowledge you alarm me for the\r\nfuture.\xe2\x80\x9d He frowned, shook his head, and looked at his visitor\r\ndespondently.\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone began to feel uneasy. The change in Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s manner\r\nseemed ominous of a reconsideration of his proposals from a new and\r\nunfavorable point of view. He took counsel of his inborn cowardice and\r\nhis inborn cunning, and proposed a solution of the difficulty\r\ndiscovered by himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we tell Lecount at all?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat right has Lecount\r\nto know? Can\xe2\x80\x99t we be married without letting her into the secret? And\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t somebody tell her afterward when we are both out of her reach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge received this proposal with an expression of surprise\r\nwhich did infinite credit to his power of control over his own\r\ncountenance. His foremost object throughout the interview had been to\r\nconduct it to this point, or, in other words, to make the first idea of\r\nkeeping the marriage a secret from Mrs. Lecount emanate from Noel\r\nVanstone instead of from himself. No one knew better than the captain\r\nthat the only responsibilities which a weak man ever accepts are\r\nresponsibilities which can be perpetually pointed out to him as resting\r\nexclusively on his own shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am accustomed to set my face against clandestine proceedings of all\r\nkinds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there are exceptions to the strictest\r\nrules; and I am bound to admit, Mr. Vanstone, that your position in\r\nthis matter is an exceptional position, if ever there was one yet. The\r\ncourse you have just proposed\xe2\x80\x94however unbecoming I may think it,\r\nhowever distasteful it may be to myself\xe2\x80\x94would not only spare you a very\r\nserious embarrassment (to say the least of it), but would also protect\r\nyou from the personal assertion of those pecuniary claims on the part\r\nof your housekeeper to which you have already adverted. These are both\r\ndesirable results to achieve\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of the removal, on my side,\r\nof all apprehension of annoyance to my niece. On the other hand,\r\nhowever, a marriage solemnized with such privacy as you propose must be\r\na hasty marriage; for, as we are situated, the longer the delay the\r\ngreater will be the risk that our secret may escape our keeping. I am\r\nnot against hasty marriages where a mutual flame is fanned by an\r\nadequate income. My own was a love-match contracted in a hurry. There\r\nare plenty of instances in the experience of every one, of short\r\ncourtships and speedy marriages, which have turned up trumps\xe2\x80\x94I beg your\r\npardon\xe2\x80\x94which have turned out well after all. But if you and my niece,\r\nMr. Vanstone, are to add one to the number of these eases, the usual\r\npreliminaries of marriage among the higher classes must be hastened by\r\nsome means. You doubtless understand me as now referring to the subject\r\nof settlements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take another teaspoonful of brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, holding\r\nout his glass with a trembling hand as the word \xe2\x80\x9csettlements\xe2\x80\x9d passed\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take a teaspoonful with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, nimbly\r\ndismounting from the pedestal of his respectability, and sipping his\r\nbrandy with the highest relish. Noel Vanstone, after nervously\r\nfollowing his host\xe2\x80\x99s example, composed himself to meet the coming\r\nordeal, with reclining head and grasping hands, in the position\r\nfamiliarly associated to all civilized humanity with a seat in a\r\ndentist\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\nThe captain put down his empty glass and got up again on his pedestal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were talking of settlements,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI have already\r\nmentioned, Mr. Vanstone, at an early period of our conversation, that\r\nmy niece presents the man of her choice with no other dowry than the\r\nmost inestimable of all gifts\xe2\x80\x94the gift of herself. This circumstance,\r\nhowever (as you are no doubt aware), does not disentitle me to make the\r\ncustomary stipulations with her future husband. According to the usual\r\ncourse in this matter, my lawyer would see yours\xe2\x80\x94consultations would\r\ntake place\xe2\x80\x94delays would occur\xe2\x80\x94strangers would be in possession of your\r\nintentions\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs. Lecount would, sooner or later, arrive at that\r\nknowledge of the truth which you are anxious to keep from her. Do you\r\nagree with me so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnutterable apprehension closed Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s lips. He could only\r\nreply by an inclination of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, you may possibly have\r\nobserved that I am a man of a very original turn of mind. If I have not\r\nhitherto struck you in that light, it may then be necessary to mention\r\nthat there are some subjects on which I persist in thinking for myself.\r\nThe subject of marriage settlements is one of them. What, let me ask\r\nyou, does a parent or guardian in my present condition usually do?\r\nAfter having trusted the man whom he has chosen for his son-in-law with\r\nthe sacred deposit of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, he turns round on that man,\r\nand declines to trust him with the infinitely inferior responsibility\r\nof providing for her pecuniary future. He fetters his son-in-law with\r\nthe most binding document the law can produce, and employs with the\r\nhusband of his own child the same precautions which he would use if he\r\nwere dealing with a stranger and a rogue. I call such conduct as this\r\ninconsistent and unbecoming in the last degree. You will not find it my\r\ncourse of conduct, Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94you will not find me preaching what I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t practice. If I trust you with my niece, I trust you with every\r\ninferior responsibility toward her and toward me. Give me your hand,\r\nsir; tell me, on your word of honor, that you will provide for your\r\nwife as becomes her position and your means, and the question of\r\nsettlements is decided between us from this moment at once and\r\nforever!\xe2\x80\x9d Having carried out Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s instructions in this lofty\r\ntone, he threw open his respectable frockcoat, and sat with head erect\r\nand hand extended, the model of parental feeling and the picture of\r\nhuman integrity.\r\n\r\nFor one moment Noel Vanstone remained literally petrified by\r\nastonishment. The next, he started from his chair and wrung the hand of\r\nhis magnanimous friend in a perfect transport of admiration. Never yet,\r\nthroughout his long and varied career, had Captain Wragge felt such\r\ndifficulty in keeping his countenance as he felt now. Contempt for the\r\noutburst of miserly gratitude of which he was the object; triumph in\r\nthe sense of successful conspiracy against a man who had rated the\r\noffer of his protection at five pounds; regret at the lost opportunity\r\nof effecting a fine stroke of moral agriculture, which his dread of\r\ninvolving himself in coming consequences had forced him to let slip\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese varied emotions agitated the captain\xe2\x80\x99s mind; all strove together\r\nto find their way to the surface through the outlets of his face or his\r\ntongue. He allowed Noel Vanstone to keep possession of his hand, and to\r\nheap one series of shrill protestations and promises on another, until\r\nhe had regained his usual mastery over himself. That result achieved,\r\nhe put the little man back in his chair, and returned forthwith to the\r\nsubject of Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we now revert to the difficulty which we have not conquered\r\nyet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us say that I do violence to my own habits\r\nand feelings; that I allow the considerations I have already mentioned\r\nto weigh with me; and that I sanction your wish to be united to my\r\nniece without the knowledge of Mrs. Lecount. Allow me to inquire in\r\nthat case what means you can suggest for the accomplishment of your\r\nend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t suggest anything,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noel Vanstone, helplessly. \xe2\x80\x9cWould\r\nyou object to suggest for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are making a bolder request than you think, Mr. Vanstone. I never\r\ndo things by halves. When I am acting with my customary candor, I am\r\nfrank (as you know already) to the utmost verge of imprudence. When\r\nexceptional circumstances compel me to take an opposite course, there\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t a slyer fox alive than I am. If, at your express request, I take\r\noff my honest English coat here and put on a Jesuit\xe2\x80\x99s gown\xe2\x80\x94if, purely\r\nout of sympathy for your awkward position, I consent to keep your\r\nsecret for you from Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x94I must have no unseasonable scruples\r\nto contend with on your part. If it is neck or nothing on my side, sir,\r\nit must be neck or nothing on yours also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeck or nothing, by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, briskly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9con the\r\nunderstanding that you go first. I have no scruples about keeping\r\nLecount in the dark. But she is devilish cunning, Mr. Bygrave. How is\r\nit to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear directly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I develop my\r\nviews, I should like to have your opinion on an abstract question of\r\nmorality. What do you think, my dear sir, of pious frauds in general?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone looked a little embarrassed by the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I put it more plainly?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nsay to the universally-accepted maxim that \xe2\x80\x98all stratagems are fair in\r\nlove and war\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x94Yes or No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Noel Vanstone, with the utmost readiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more question and I have done,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see any\r\nparticular objection to practicing a pious fraud on Mrs. Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s resolution began to falter a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Lecount likely to find it out?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked cautiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly discover it until you are married and out of her\r\nreach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlay any trick you like on Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, with an air\r\nof unutterable relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had my suspicions lately that she is\r\ntrying to domineer over me; I am beginning to feel that I have borne\r\nwith Lecount long enough. I wish I was well rid of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have your wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be rid of\r\nher in a week or ten days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone rose eagerly and approached the captain\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean to send her away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to send her on a journey,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom your house at Aldborough to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s bedside at Zurich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone started back at the answer, and returned suddenly to his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, in the greatest perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cHer\r\nbrother (hang him!) is much better. She had another letter from Zurich\r\nto say so, this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She always worries about her brother\xe2\x80\x94she _would_ show it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it from? and what did it say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was from the doctor\xe2\x80\x94he always writes to her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care two\r\nstraws about her brother, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember much of the letter,\r\nexcept that it was a short one. The fellow was much better; and if the\r\ndoctor didn\xe2\x80\x99t write again, she might take it for granted that he was\r\ngetting well. That was the substance of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice where she put the letter when you gave it her back\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She put it in the drawer where she keeps her account-books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you get at that drawer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I can. I have got a duplicate key\xe2\x80\x94I always insist on a\r\nduplicate key of the place where she keeps her account books. I never\r\nallow the account-books to be locked up from my inspection: it\xe2\x80\x99s a rule\r\nof the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to get that letter to-day, Mr. Vanstone, without your\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, and add to the favor by letting me have it\r\nhere privately for an hour or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some more questions to ask before I tell you. Have you any\r\nintimate friend at Zurich whom you could trust to help you in playing a\r\ntrick on Mrs. Lecount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of help do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were to send a letter addressed to\r\nMrs. Lecount at Aldborough, inclosed in another letter addressed to one\r\nof your friends abroad? And suppose you were to instruct that friend to\r\nhelp a harmless practical joke by posting Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s letter at\r\nZurich? Do you know any one who could be trusted to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know two people who could be trusted!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x94both spinsters\xe2\x80\x94both bitter enemies of Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s. But what is\r\nyour drift, Mr. Bygrave? Though I am not usually wanting in\r\npenetration, I don\xe2\x80\x99t altogether see your drift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see it directly, Mr. Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he rose, withdrew to his desk in the corner of the\r\nroom, and wrote a few lines on a sheet of note-paper. After first\r\nreading them carefully to himself, he beckoned to Noel Vanstone to come\r\nand read them too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few minutes since,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, pointing complacently to his\r\nown composition with the feather end of his pen, \xe2\x80\x9cI had the honor of\r\nsuggesting a pious fraud on Mrs. Lecount. There it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe resigned his chair at the writing-table to his visitor. Noel\r\nVanstone sat down, and read these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MADAM\xe2\x80\x94Since I last wrote, I deeply regret to inform you that\r\nyour brother has suffered a relapse. The symptoms are so serious, that\r\nit is my painful duty to summon you instantly to his bedside. I am\r\nmaking every effort to resist the renewed progress of the malady, and I\r\nhave not yet lost all hope of success. But I cannot reconcile it to my\r\nconscience to leave you in ignorance of a serious change in my patient\r\nfor the worse, which _may_ be attended by fatal results. With much\r\nsympathy, I remain, etc. etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge waited with some anxiety for the effect which this\r\nletter might produce. Mean, selfish, and cowardly as he was, even Noel\r\nVanstone might feel some compunction at practicing such a deception as\r\nwas here suggested on a woman who stood toward him in the position of\r\nMrs. Lecount. She had served him faithfully, however interested her\r\nmotives might be\xe2\x80\x94she had lived since he was a lad in the full\r\npossession of his father\xe2\x80\x99s confidence\xe2\x80\x94she was living now under the\r\nprotection of his own roof. Could he fail to remember this; and,\r\nremembering it, could he lend his aid without hesitation to the scheme\r\nwhich was now proposed to him? Captain Wragge unconsciously retained\r\nbelief enough in human nature to doubt it. To his surprise, and, it\r\nmust be added, to his relief, also, his apprehensions proved to be\r\ngroundless. The only emotions aroused in Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s mind by a\r\nperusal of the letter were a hearty admiration of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s idea,\r\nand a vainglorious anxiety to claim the credit to himself of being the\r\nperson who carried it out. Examples may be found every day of a fool\r\nwho is no coward; examples may be found occasionally of a fool who is\r\nnot cunning; but it may reasonably be doubted whether there is a\r\nproducible instance anywhere of a fool who is not cruel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfect!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, clapping his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bygrave, you\r\nare as good as Figaro in the French comedy. Talking of French, there is\r\none serious mistake in this clever letter of yours\xe2\x80\x94it is written in the\r\nwrong language. When the doctor writes to Lecount, he writes in French.\r\nPerhaps you meant me to translate it? You can\xe2\x80\x99t manage without my help,\r\ncan you? I write French as fluently as I write English. Just look at\r\nme! I\xe2\x80\x99ll translate it, while I sit here, in two strokes of the pen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe completed the translation almost as rapidly as Captain Wragge had\r\nproduced the original. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, in high critical\r\ntriumph at discovering another defect in the composition of his\r\ningenious friend. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor always dates his letters. Here is no date\r\nto yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave the date to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, with a sardonic smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have discovered the fault, my dear sir\xe2\x80\x94pray correct it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone mentally looked into the great gulf which separates the\r\nfaculty that can discover a defect, from the faculty that can apply a\r\nremedy, and, following the example of many a wiser man, declined to\r\ncross over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of taking the liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, politely. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\r\nyou had a motive for leaving the date out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I had,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Wragge, with his easiest good-humor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe date must depend on the time a letter takes to get to Zurich. _I_\r\nhave had no experience on that point\xe2\x80\x94_you_ must have had plenty of\r\nexperience in your father\xe2\x80\x99s time. Give me the benefit of your\r\ninformation, and we will add the date before you leave the\r\nwriting-table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s experience was, as Captain Wragge had anticipated,\r\nperfectly competent to settle the question of time. The railway\r\nresources of the Continent (in the year eighteen hundred and\r\nforty-seven) were but scanty; and a letter sent at that period from\r\nEngland to Zurich, and from Zurich back again to England, occupied ten\r\ndays in making the double journey by post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDate the letter in French five days on from to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncaptain, when he had got his information. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good. The next thing is\r\nto let me have the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note as soon as you can. I may be obliged\r\nto practice some hours before I can copy your translation in an exact\r\nimitation of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting. Have you got any foreign\r\nnote-paper? Let me have a few sheets, and send, at the same time, an\r\nenvelope addressed to one of those lady-friends of yours at Zurich,\r\naccompanied by the necessary request to post the inclosure. This is all\r\nI need trouble you to do, Mr. Vanstone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me seem inhospitable;\r\nbut the sooner you can supply me with my materials, the better I shall\r\nbe pleased. We entirely understand each other, I suppose? Having\r\naccepted your proposal for my niece\xe2\x80\x99s hand, I sanction a private\r\nmarriage in consideration of the circumstances on your side. A little\r\nharmless stratagem is necessary to forward your views. I invent the\r\nstratagem at your request, and you make use of it without the least\r\nhesitation. The result is, that in ten days from to-morrow Mrs. Lecount\r\nwill be on her way to Switzerland; in fifteen days from to-morrow Mrs.\r\nLecount will reach Zurich, and discover the trick we have played her;\r\nin twenty days from to-morrow Mrs. Lecount will be back at Aldborough,\r\nand will find her master\xe2\x80\x99s wedding-cards on the table, and her master\r\nhimself away on his honey-moon trip. I put it arithmetically, for the\r\nsake of putting it plain. God bless you. Good-morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I may have the happiness of seeing Miss Bygrave to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Noel Vanstone, turning round at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be careful,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t forbid\r\nto-morrow, but I make no promise beyond that. Permit me to remind you\r\nthat we have got Mrs. Lecount to manage for the next ten days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Lecount was at the bottom of the German Ocean!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Noel\r\nVanstone, fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for you to manage her\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t live in the house. What am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cGo out for your walk\r\nalone, and drop in here, as you dropped in to-day, at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. In\r\nthe meantime, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget those things I want you to send me. Seal\r\nthem up together in a large envelope. When you have done that, ask Mrs.\r\nLecount to walk out with you as usual; and while she is upstairs\r\nputting her bonnet on, send the servant across to me. You understand?\r\nGood-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hour afterward, the sealed envelope, with its inclosures, reached\r\nCaptain Wragge in perfect safety. The double task of exactly imitating\r\na strange handwriting, and accurately copying words written in a\r\nlanguage with which he was but slightly acquainted, presented more\r\ndifficulties to be overcome than the captain had anticipated. It was\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock before the employment which he had undertaken was\r\nsuccessfully completed, and the letter to Zurich ready for the post.\r\n\r\nBefore going to bed, he walked out on the deserted Parade to breathe\r\nthe cool night air. All the lights were extinguished in Sea-view\r\nCottage, when he looked that way, except the light in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindow. Captain Wragge shook his head suspiciously. He had gained\r\nexperience enough by this time to distrust the wakefulness of Mrs.\r\nLecount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nIf Captain Wragge could have looked into Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s room while he\r\nstood on the Parade watching the light in her window, he would have\r\nseen the housekeeper sitting absorbed in meditation over a worthless\r\nlittle morsel of brown stuff which lay on her toilet-table.\r\n\r\nHowever exasperating to herself the conclusion might be, Mrs. Lecount\r\ncould not fail to see that she had been thus far met and baffled\r\nsuccessfully at every point. What was she to do next? If she sent for\r\nMr. Pendril when he came to Aldborough (with only a few hours spared\r\nfrom his business at her disposal), what definite course would there be\r\nfor him to follow? If she showed Noel Vanstone the original letter from\r\nwhich her note had been copied, he would apply instantly to the writer\r\nfor an explanation: would expose the fabricated story by which Mrs.\r\nLecount had succeeded in imposing on Miss Garth; and would, in any\r\nevent, still declare, on the evidence of his own eyes, that the test by\r\nthe marks on the neck had utterly failed. Miss Vanstone, the elder,\r\nwhose unexpected presence at Aldborough might have done wonders\xe2\x80\x94whose\r\nvoice in the hall at North Shingles, even if she had been admitted no\r\nfurther, might have reached her sister\xe2\x80\x99s ears and led to instant\r\nresults\xe2\x80\x94Miss Vanstone, the elder, was out of the country, and was not\r\nlikely to return for a month at least. Look as anxiously as Mrs.\r\nLecount might along the course which she had hitherto followed, she\r\nfailed to see her way through the accumulated obstacles which now\r\nbarred her advance.\r\n\r\nOther women in this position might have waited until circumstances\r\naltered, and helped them. Mrs. Lecount boldly retraced her steps, and\r\ndetermined to find her way to her end in a new direction. Resigning for\r\nthe present all further attempt to prove that the false Miss Bygrave\r\nwas the true Magdalen Vanstone, she resolved to narrow the range of her\r\nnext efforts; to leave the actual question of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s identity\r\nuntouched; and to rest satisfied with convincing her master of this\r\nsimple fact\xe2\x80\x94that the young lady who was charming him at North Shingles,\r\nand the disguised woman who had terrified him in Vauxhall Walk, were\r\none and the same person.\r\n\r\nThe means of effecting this new object were, to all appearance, far\r\nless easy of attainment than the means of effecting the object which\r\nMrs. Lecount had just resigned. Here no help was to be expected from\r\nothers, no ostensibly benevolent motives could be put forward as a\r\nblind\xe2\x80\x94no appeal could be made to Mr. Pendril or to Miss Garth. Here the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s only chance of success depended, in the first place, on\r\nher being able to effect a stolen entrance into Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nand, in the second place, on her ability to discover whether that\r\nmemorable alpaca dress from which she had secretly cut the fragment of\r\nstuff happened to form part of Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe.\r\n\r\nTaking the difficulties now before her in their order as they occurred,\r\nMrs. Lecount first resolved to devote the next few days to watching the\r\nhabits of the inmates of North Shingles, from early in the morning to\r\nlate at night, and to testing the capacity of the one servant in the\r\nhouse to resist the temptation of a bribe. Assuming that results proved\r\nsuccessful, and that, either by money or by stratagem, she gained\r\nadmission to North Shingles (without the knowledge of Mr. Bygrave or\r\nhis niece), she turned next to the second difficulty of the two\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining access to Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe.\r\n\r\nIf the servant proved corruptible, all obstacles in this direction\r\nmight be considered as removed beforehand. But if the servant proved\r\nhonest, the new problem was no easy one to solve.\r\n\r\nLong and careful consideration of the question led the housekeeper at\r\nlast to the bold resolution of obtaining an interview\xe2\x80\x94if the servant\r\nfailed her\xe2\x80\x94with Mrs. Bygrave herself. What was the true cause of this\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious seclusion? Was she a person of the strictest and the\r\nmost inconvenient integrity? or a person who could not be depended on\r\nto preserve a secret? or a person who was as artful as Mr. Bygrave\r\nhimself, and who was kept in reserve to forward the object of some new\r\ndeception which was yet to come? In the first two cases, Mrs. Lecount\r\ncould trust in her own powers of dissimulation, and in the results\r\nwhich they might achieve. In the last case (if no other end was\r\ngained), it might be of vital importance to her to discover an enemy\r\nhidden in the dark. In any event, she determined to run the risk. Of\r\nthe three chances in her favor on which she had reckoned at the outset\r\nof the struggle\xe2\x80\x94the chance of entrapping Magdalen by word of mouth, the\r\nchance of entrapping her by the help of her friends, and the chance of\r\nentrapping her by means of Mrs. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94two had been tried, and two had\r\nfailed. The third remained to be tested yet; and the third might\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nSo, the captain\xe2\x80\x99s enemy plotted against him in the privacy of her own\r\nchamber, while the captain watched the light in her window from the\r\nbeach outside.\r\n\r\nBefore breakfast the next morning, Captain Wragge posted the forged\r\nletter to Zurich with his own hand. He went back to North Shingles with\r\nhis mind not quite decided on the course to take with Mrs. Lecount\r\nduring the all-important interval of the next ten days.\r\n\r\nGreatly to his surprise, his doubts on this point were abruptly decided\r\nby Magdalen herself.\r\n\r\nHe found her waiting for him in the room where the breakfast was laid.\r\nShe was walking restlessly to and fro, with her head drooping on her\r\nbosom and her hair hanging disordered over her shoulders. The moment\r\nshe looked up on his entrance, the captain felt the fear which Mrs.\r\nWragge had felt before him\xe2\x80\x94the fear that her mind would be struck\r\nprostrate again, as it had been struck once already, when Frank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter reached her in Vauxhall Walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he coming again to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, pushing away from her the chair\r\nwhich Captain Wragge offered, with such violence that she threw it on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, wisely answering her in the fewest words. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis coming at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me away!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, tossing her hair back wildly from her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cTake me away before he comes. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get over the horror of\r\nmarrying him while I am in this hateful place; take me somewhere where\r\nI can forget it, or I shall go mad! Give me two days\xe2\x80\x99 rest\xe2\x80\x94two days out\r\nof sight of that horrible sea\xe2\x80\x94two days out of prison in this horrible\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94two days anywhere in the wide world away from Aldborough. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome back with you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through with it to the end! Only give me\r\ntwo days\xe2\x80\x99 escape from that man and everything belonging to him! Do you\r\nhear, you villain?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, seizing his arm and shaking it in a\r\nfrenzy of passion; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been tortured enough\xe2\x80\x94I can bear it no\r\nlonger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was but one way of quieting her, and the captain instantly took\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will try to control yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall leave\r\nAldborough in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped his arm, and leaned back heavily against the wall behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, struggling for breath, but looking at him\r\nless wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t complain of me, if I can help it.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nattempted confusedly to take her handkerchief from her apron pocket,\r\nand failed to find it. The captain took it out for her. Her eyes\r\nsoftened, and she drew her breath more freely as she received the\r\nhandkerchief from him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a kinder man than I thought you were,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said; \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry I spoke so passionately to you just now\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nvery, very sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d The tears stole into her eyes, and she offered him\r\nher hand with the native grace and gentleness of happier days. \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\nfriends with me again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pleadingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only a girl, Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m only a girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand in silence, patted it for a moment, and then opened\r\nthe door for her to go back to her own room again. There was genuine\r\nregret in his face as he showed her that trifling attention. He was a\r\nvagabond and a cheat; he had lived a mean, shuffling, degraded life,\r\nbut he was human; and she had found her way to the lost sympathies in\r\nhim which not even the self-profanation of a swindler\xe2\x80\x99s existence could\r\nwholly destroy. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn the breakfast!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when the servant came in\r\nfor her orders. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to the inn directly, and say I want a carriage and\r\npair at the door in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d He went out into the passage,\r\nstill chafing under a sense of mental disturbance which was new to him,\r\nand shouted to his wife more fiercely than ever\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPack up what we want\r\nfor a week\xe2\x80\x99s absence, and be ready in half an hour!\xe2\x80\x9d Having issued\r\nthose directions, he returned to the breakfast-room, and looked at the\r\nhalf-spread table with an impatient wonder at his disinclination to do\r\njustice to his own meal. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has rubbed off the edge of my appetite,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said to himself, with a forced laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try a cigar, and a turn\r\nin the fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf he had been twenty years younger, those remedies might have failed\r\nhim. But where is the man to be found whose internal policy succumbs to\r\nrevolution when that man is on the wrong side of fifty? Exercise and\r\nchange of place gave the captain back into the possession of himself.\r\nHe recovered the lost sense of the flavor of his cigar, and recalled\r\nhis wandering attention to the question of his approaching absence from\r\nAldborough. A few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 consideration satisfied his mind that\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak had forced him to take the course of all others\r\nwhich, on a fair review of existing emergencies, it was now most\r\ndesirable to adopt.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries on the evening when he and Magdalen had\r\ndrunk tea at Sea View had certainly informed him that the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother possessed a modest competence; that his sister was his nearest\r\nliving relative; and that there were some unscrupulous cousins on the\r\nspot who were anxious to usurp the place in his will which properly\r\nbelonged to Mrs. Lecount. Here were strong motives to take the\r\nhousekeeper to Zurich when the false report of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s relapse\r\nreached England. But if any idea of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s true position\r\ndawned on her in the meantime, who could say whether she might not, at\r\nthe eleventh hour, prefer asserting her large pecuniary interest in her\r\nmaster, to defending her small pecuniary interest at her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedside? While that question remained undecided, the plain necessity of\r\nchecking the growth of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s intimacy with the family at\r\nNorth Shingles did not admit of a doubt; and of all means of effecting\r\nthat object, none could be less open to suspicion than the temporary\r\nremoval of the household from their residence at Aldborough. Thoroughly\r\nsatisfied with the soundness of this conclusion, Captain Wragge made\r\nstraight for Sea-view Cottage, to apologize and explain before the\r\ncarriage came and the departure took place.\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone was easily accessible to visitors; he was walking in the\r\ngarden before breakfast. His disappointment and vexation were freely\r\nexpressed when he heard the news which his friend had to communicate.\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s fluent tongue, however, soon impressed on him the\r\nnecessity of resignation to present circumstances. The bare hint that\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cpious fraud\xe2\x80\x9d might fail after all, if anything happened in the ten\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 interval to enlighten Mrs. Lecount, had an instant effect in\r\nmaking Noel Vanstone as patient and as submissive as could be wished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you where we are going, for two good reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCaptain Wragge, when his preliminary explanations were completed. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthe first place, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made up my mind yet; and, in the second\r\nplace, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where our destination is, Mrs. Lecount can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworm it out of you. I have not the least doubt she is watching us at\r\nthis moment from behind her window-curtain. When she asks what I wanted\r\nwith you this morning, tell her I came to say good-by for a few days,\r\nfinding my niece not so well again, and wishing to take her on a short\r\nvisit to some friends to try change of air. If you could produce an\r\nimpression on Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s mind (without overdoing it), that you are\r\na little disappointed in me, and that you are rather inclined to doubt\r\nmy heartiness in cultivating your acquaintance, you will greatly help\r\nour present object. You may depend on our return to North Shingles in\r\nfour or five days at furthest. If anything strikes me in the meanwhile,\r\nthe post is always at our service, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t fail to write to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Bygrave write to me?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Noel Vanstone, piteously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she know you were coming here? Did she send me no message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnpardonable on my part to have forgotten it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nsent you her love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone closed his eyes in silent ecstasy.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened them again Captain Wragge had passed through the garden\r\ngate and was on his way back to North Shingles. As soon as his own door\r\nhad closed on him, Mrs. Lecount descended from the post of observation\r\nwhich the captain had rightly suspected her of occupying, and addressed\r\nthe inquiry to her master which the captain had rightly foreseen would\r\nfollow his departure. The reply she received produced but one\r\nimpression on her mind. She at once set it down as a falsehood, and\r\nreturned to her own window to keep watch over North Shingles more\r\nvigilantly than ever.\r\n\r\nTo her utter astonishment, after a lapse of less than half an hour she\r\nsaw an empty carriage draw up at Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s door. Luggage was\r\nbrought out and packed on the vehicle. Miss Bygrave appeared, and took\r\nher seat in it. She was followed into the carriage by a lady of great\r\nsize and stature, whom the housekeeper conjectured to be Mrs. Bygrave.\r\nThe servant came next, and stood waiting on the path. The last person\r\nto appear was Mr. Bygrave. He locked the house door, and took the key\r\naway with him to a cottage near at hand, which was the residence of the\r\nlandlord of North Shingles. On his return, he nodded to the servant,\r\nwho walked away by herself toward the humbler quarter of the little\r\ntown, and joined the ladies in the carriage. The coachman mounted the\r\nbox, and the vehicle disappeared.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount laid down the opera-glass, through which she had been\r\nclosely investigating these proceedings, with a feeling of helpless\r\nperplexity which she was almost ashamed to acknowledge to herself. The\r\nsecret of Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s object in suddenly emptying his house at\r\nAldborough of every living creature in it was an impenetrable mystery\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nSubmitting herself to circumstances with a ready resignation which\r\nCaptain Wragge had not shown, on his side, in a similar situation, Mrs.\r\nLecount wasted neither time nor temper in unprofitable guess-work. She\r\nleft the mystery to thicken or to clear, as the future might decide,\r\nand looked exclusively at the uses to which she might put the morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevent in her own interests. Whatever might have become of the family at\r\nNorth Shingles, the servant was left behind, and the servant was\r\nexactly the person whose assistance might now be of vital importance to\r\nthe housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s projects. Mrs. Lecount put on her bonnet, inspected\r\nthe collection of loose silver in her purse, and set forth on the spot\r\nto make the servant\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance.\r\n\r\nShe went first to the cottage at which Mr. Bygrave had left the key of\r\nNorth Shingles, to discover the servant\xe2\x80\x99s present address from the\r\nlandlord. So far as this object was concerned, her errand proved\r\nsuccessful. The landlord knew that the girl had been allowed to go home\r\nfor a few days to her friends, and knew in what part of Aldborough her\r\nfriends lived. But here his sources of information suddenly dried up.\r\nHe knew nothing of the destination to which Mr. Bygrave and his family\r\nhad betaken themselves, and he was perfectly ignorant of the number of\r\ndays over which their absence might be expected to extend. All he could\r\nsay was, that he had not received a notice to quit from his tenant, and\r\nthat he had been requested to keep the key of the house in his\r\npossession until Mr. Bygrave returned to claim it in his own person.\r\n\r\nBaffled, but not discouraged, Mrs. Lecount turned her steps next toward\r\nthe back street of Aldborough, and astonished the servant\xe2\x80\x99s relatives\r\nby conferring on them the honor of a morning call.\r\n\r\nEasily imposed on at starting by Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s pretense of calling to\r\nengage her, under the impression that she had left Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice, the servant did her best to answer the questions put to her.\r\nBut she knew as little as the landlord of her master\xe2\x80\x99s plans. All she\r\ncould say about them was, that she had not been dismissed, and that she\r\nwas to await the receipt of a note recalling her when necessary to her\r\nsituation at North Shingles. Not having expected to find her better\r\ninformed on this part of the subject, Mrs. Lecount smoothly shifted her\r\nground, and led the woman into talking generally of the advantages and\r\ndefects of her situation in Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s family.\r\n\r\nProfiting by the knowledge gained, in this indirect manner, of the\r\nlittle secrets of the household, Mrs. Lecount made two discoveries. She\r\nfound out, in the first place, that the servant (having enough to do in\r\nattending to the coarser part of the domestic work) was in no position\r\nto disclose the secrets of Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe, which were known\r\nonly to the young lady herself and to her aunt. In the second place,\r\nthe housekeeper ascertained that the true reason of Mrs. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrigid seclusion was to be found in the simple fact that she was little\r\nbetter than an idiot, and that her husband was probably ashamed of\r\nallowing her to be seen in public. These apparently trivial discoveries\r\nenlightened Mrs. Lecount on a very important point which had been\r\npreviously involved in doubt. She was now satisfied that the likeliest\r\nway to obtaining a private investigation of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe lay\r\nthrough deluding the imbecile lady, and not through bribing the\r\nignorant servant.\r\n\r\nHaving reached that conclusion\xe2\x80\x94pregnant with coming assaults on the\r\nweakly-fortified discretion of poor Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x94the housekeeper\r\ncautiously abstained from exhibiting herself any longer under an\r\ninquisitive aspect. She changed the conversation to local topics,\r\nwaited until she was sure of leaving an excellent impression behind\r\nher, and then took her leave.\r\n\r\nThree days passed; and Mrs. Lecount and her master\xe2\x80\x94each with their\r\nwidely-different ends in view\xe2\x80\x94watched with equal anxiety for the first\r\nsigns of returning life in the direction of North Shingles. In that\r\ninterval, no letter either from the uncle or the niece arrived for Noel\r\nVanstone. His sincere feeling of irritation under this neglectful\r\ntreatment greatly assisted the effect of those feigned doubts on the\r\nsubject of his absent friends which the captain had recommended him to\r\nexpress in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s presence. He confessed his apprehensions\r\nof having been mistaken, not in Mr. Bygrave only, but even in his niece\r\nas well, with such a genuine air of annoyance that he actually\r\ncontributed a new element of confusion to the existing perplexities of\r\nMrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day Noel Vanstone met the postman in the\r\ngarden; and, to his great relief, discovered among the letters\r\ndelivered to him a note from Mr. Bygrave.\r\n\r\nThe date of the note was \xe2\x80\x9cWoodbridge,\xe2\x80\x9d and it contained a few lines\r\nonly. Mr. Bygrave mentioned that his niece was better, and that she\r\nsent her love as before. He proposed returning to Aldborough on the\r\nnext day, when he would have some new considerations of a strictly\r\nprivate nature to present to Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s mind. In the meantime\r\nhe would beg Mr. Vanstone not to call at North Shingles until he\r\nreceived a special invitation to do so\xe2\x80\x94which invitation should\r\ncertainly be given on the day when the family returned. The motive of\r\nthis apparently strange request should be explained to Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfect satisfaction when he was once more united to his friends. Until\r\nthat period arrived, the strictest caution was enjoined on him in all\r\nhis communications with Mrs. Lecount; and the instant destruction of\r\nMr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s letter, after due perusal of it, was (if the classical\r\nphrase might be pardoned) a _sine qua non_.\r\n\r\nThe fifth day came. Noel Vanstone (after submitting himself to the\r\n_sine qua non_, and destroying the letter) waited anxiously for\r\nresults; while Mrs. Lecount, on her side, watched patiently for events.\r\nToward three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon the carriage appeared again at\r\nthe gate of North Shingles. Mr. Bygrave got out and tripped away\r\nbriskly to the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s cottage for the key. He returned with the\r\nservant at his heels. Miss Bygrave left the carriage; her giant\r\nrelative followed her example; the house door was opened; the trunks\r\nwere taken off; the carriage disappeared, and the Bygraves were at home\r\nagain!\r\n\r\nFour o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck, five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and nothing happened.\r\nIn half an hour more, Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94spruce, speckless, and respectable as\r\never\xe2\x80\x94appeared on the Parade, sauntering composedly in the direction of\r\nSea View.\r\n\r\nInstead of at once entering the house, he passed it; stopped, as if\r\nstruck by a sudden recollection; and, retracing his steps, asked for\r\nMr. Vanstone at the door. Mr. Vanstone came out hospitably into the\r\npassage. Pitching his voice to a tone which could be easily heard by\r\nany listening individual through any open door in the bedroom regions,\r\nMr. Bygrave announced the object of his visit on the door-mat in the\r\nfewest possible words. He had been staying with a distant relative. The\r\ndistant relative possessed two pictures\xe2\x80\x94Gems by the Old Masters\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nhe was willing to dispose of, and which he had intrusted for that\r\npurpose to Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s care. If Mr. Noel Vanstone, as an amateur in\r\nsuch matters, wished to see the Gems, they would be visible in half an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s time, when Mr. Bygrave would have returned to North Shingles.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of this incomprehensible announcement, the\r\narch-conspirator laid his significant forefinger along the side of his\r\nshort Roman nose, said, \xe2\x80\x9cFine weather, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Good-afternoon!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsauntered out inscrutably to continue his walk on the Parade.\r\n\r\nOn the expiration of the half-hour Noel Vanstone presented himself at\r\nNorth Shingles, with the ardor of a lover burning inextinguishably in\r\nhis bosom, through the superincumbent mental fog of a thoroughly\r\nbewildered man. To his inexpressible happiness, he found Magdalen alone\r\nin the parlor. Never yet had she looked so beautiful in his eyes. The\r\nrest and relief of her four days\xe2\x80\x99 absence from Aldborough had not\r\nfailed to produce their results; she had more than recovered her\r\ncomposure. Vibrating perpetually from one violent extreme to another,\r\nshe had now passed from the passionate despair of five days since to a\r\nfeverish exaltation of spirits which defied all remorse and confronted\r\nall consequences. Her eyes sparkled; her cheeks were bright with color;\r\nshe talked incessantly, with a forlorn mockery of the girlish gayety of\r\npast days; she laughed with a deplorable persistency in laughing; she\r\nimitated Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s smooth voice, and Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s insinuating\r\ngraces of manner with an overcharged resemblance to the original, which\r\nwas but the coarse reflection of the delicately-accurate mimicry of\r\nformer times. Noel Vanstone, who had never yet seen her as he saw her\r\nnow, was enchanted; his weak head whirled with an intoxication of\r\nenjoyment; his wizen cheeks flushed as if they had caught the infection\r\nfrom hers. The half-hour during which he was alone with her passed like\r\nfive minutes to him. When that time had elapsed, and when she suddenly\r\nleft him\xe2\x80\x94to obey a previously-arranged summons to her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence\xe2\x80\x94miser as he was, he would have paid at that moment five golden\r\nsovereigns out of his pocket for five golden minutes more passed in her\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe door had hardly closed on Magdalen before it opened again, and the\r\ncaptain walked in. He entered on the explanations which his visitor\r\nnaturally expected from him with the unceremonious abruptness of a man\r\nhard pressed for time, and determined to make the most of every moment\r\nat his disposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince we last saw each other,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been reckoning up the\r\nchances for and against us as we stand at present. The result on my own\r\nmind is this: If you are still at Aldborough when that letter from\r\nZurich reaches Mrs. Lecount, all the pains we have taken will have been\r\npains thrown away. If your housekeeper had fifty brothers all dying\r\ntogether, she would throw the whole fifty over sooner than leave you\r\nalone at Sea View while we are your neighbors at North Shingles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s flushed cheek turned pale with dismay. His own\r\nknowledge of Mrs. Lecount told him that this view of the case was the\r\nright one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _we_ go away again,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing will be\r\ngained, for nothing would persuade your housekeeper, in that case, that\r\nwe have not left you the means of following us. _You_ must leave\r\nAldborough this time; and, what is more, you must go without leaving a\r\nsingle visible trace behind you for us to follow. If we accomplish this\r\nobject in the course of the next five days, Mrs. Lecount will take the\r\njourney to Zurich. If we fail, she will be a fixture at Sea View, to a\r\ndead certainty. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions! I have got your instructions ready\r\nfor you, and I want your closest attention to them. Your marriage with\r\nmy niece depends on your not forgetting a word of what I am now going\r\nto tell you.\xe2\x80\x94One question first. Have you followed my advice? Have you\r\ntold Mrs. Lecount you are beginning to think yourself mistaken in me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did worse than that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noel Vanstone penitently. \xe2\x80\x9cI committed\r\nan outrage on my own feelings. I disgraced myself by saying that I\r\ndoubted Miss Bygrave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on disgracing yourself, my dear sir! Doubt us both with all your\r\nmight, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. One question more. Did I speak loud enough\r\nthis afternoon? Did Mrs. Lecount hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Lecount opened her door; Lecount heard you. What made you give me\r\nthat message? I see no pictures here. Is this another pious fraud, Mr.\r\nBygrave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirably guessed, Mr. Vanstone! You will see the object of my\r\nimaginary picture-dealing in the very next words which I am now about\r\nto address to you. When you get back to Sea View, this is what you are\r\nto say to Mrs. Lecount. Tell her that my relative\xe2\x80\x99s works of Art are\r\ntwo worthless pictures\xe2\x80\x94copies from the Old Masters, which I have tried\r\nto sell you as originals at an exorbitant price. Say you suspect me of\r\nbeing little better than a plausible impostor, and pity my unfortunate\r\nniece for being associated with such a rascal as I am. There is your\r\ntext to speak from. Say in many words what I have just said in a few.\r\nYou can do that, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I can do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can tell you one\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94Lecount won\xe2\x80\x99t believe me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, Mr. Vanstone; I have not done with my instructions yet.\r\nYou understand what I have just told you? Very good. We may get on from\r\nto-day to to-morrow. Go out to-morrow with Mrs. Lecount at your usual\r\ntime. I will meet you on the Parade, and bow to you. Instead of\r\nreturning my bow, look the other way. In plain English, cut me! That is\r\neasy enough to do, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94she won\xe2\x80\x99t believe me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little again, Mr. Vanstone. There are more instructions to\r\ncome. You have got your directions for to-day, and you have got your\r\ndirections for to-morrow. Now for the day after. The day after is the\r\nseventh day since we sent the letter to Zurich. On the seventh day\r\ndecline to go out walking as before, from dread of the annoyance of\r\nmeeting me again. Grumble about the smallness of the place; complain of\r\nyour health; wish you had never come to Aldborough, and never made\r\nacquaintances with the Bygraves; and when you have well worried Mrs.\r\nLecount with your discontent, ask her on a sudden if she can\xe2\x80\x99t suggest\r\na change for the better. If you put that question to her naturally, do\r\nyou think she can be depended on to answer it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t want to be questioned at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noel Vanstone,\r\nirritably. \xe2\x80\x9cI have only got to say I am tired of Aldborough; and, if\r\nshe believes me\xe2\x80\x94which she won\xe2\x80\x99t; I\xe2\x80\x99m quite positive, Mr. Bygrave, she\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x94she will have her suggestion ready before I can ask for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is some place, then, that\r\nMrs. Lecount wants to go to this autumn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants to go there (hang her!) every autumn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him, do you?\xe2\x80\x94at St.\r\nCrux-in-the-Marsh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lose your patience, Mr. Vanstone! What you are now telling me is\r\nof the most vital importance to the object we have in view. Who is\r\nAdmiral Bartram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old friend of my father\xe2\x80\x99s. My father laid him under obligations\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nfather lent him money when they were both young men. I am like one of\r\nthe family at St. Crux; my room is always kept ready for me. Not that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s any family at the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s except his nephew, George Bartram.\r\nGeorge is my cousin; I\xe2\x80\x99m as intimate with George as my father was with\r\nthe admiral; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sharper than my father, for I haven\xe2\x80\x99t lent\r\nmy friend any money. Lecount always makes a show of liking George\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve to annoy me. She likes the admiral, too; he flatters her\r\nvanity. He always invites her to come with me to St. Crux. He lets her\r\nhave one of the best bedrooms, and treats her as if she was a lady. She\r\nis as proud as Lucifer\xe2\x80\x94she likes being treated like a lady\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\npesters me every autumn to go to St. Crux. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? What are\r\nyou taking out your pocketbook for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s address, Mr. Vanstone, for a purpose which I will\r\nexplain immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, Captain Wragge opened his pocketbook and wrote down\r\nthe address from Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s dictation, as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cAdmiral\r\nBartram, St. Crux-in-the-Marsh, near Ossory, Essex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain, closing his pocketbook again. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only\r\ndifficulty that stood in our way is now cleared out of it. Patience,\r\nMr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x94patience! Let us take up my instructions again at the\r\npoint where we dropped them. Give me five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 more attention, and\r\nyou will see your way to your marriage as plainly as I see it. On the\r\nday after to-morrow you declare you are tired of Aldborough, and Mrs.\r\nLecount suggests St. Crux. You don\xe2\x80\x99t say yes or no on the spot; you\r\ntake the next day to consider it, and you make up your mind the last\r\nthing at night to go to St. Crux the first thing in the morning. Are\r\nyou in the habit of superintending your own packing up, or do you\r\nusually shift all the trouble of it on Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLecount has all the trouble, of course; Lecount is paid for it! But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t really go, do I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go as fast as horses can take you to the railway without having\r\nheld any previous communication with this house, either personally or\r\nby letter. You leave Mrs. Lecount behind to pack up your curiosities,\r\nto settle with the tradespeople, and to follow you to St. Crux the next\r\nmorning. The next morning is the tenth morning. On the tenth morning\r\nshe receives the letter from Zurich; and if you only carry out my\r\ninstructions, Mr. Vanstone, as sure as you sit there, to Zurich she\r\ngoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s color began to rise again, as the captain\xe2\x80\x99s stratagem\r\ndawned on him at last in its true light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what am I to do at St. Crux?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait there till I call for you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s back is turned, I will go to the church here and give the\r\nnecessary notice of the marriage. The same day or the next, I will\r\ntravel to the address written down in my pocketbook, pick you up at the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s, and take you on to London with me to get the license. With\r\nthat document in our possession, we shall be on our way back to\r\nAldborough while Mrs. Lecount is on her way out to Zurich; and before\r\nshe starts on her return journey, you and my niece will be man and\r\nwife! There are your future prospects for you. What do you think of\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a head you have got!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, in a sudden outburst\r\nof enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the most extraordinary man I ever met with. One\r\nwould think you had done nothing all your life but take people in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge received that unconscious tribute to his native genius\r\nwith the complacency of a man who felt that he thoroughly deserved it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you already, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, modestly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nnever do things by halves. Pardon me for reminding you that we have no\r\ntime for exchanging mutual civilities. Are you quite sure about your\r\ninstructions? I dare not write them down for fear of accidents. Try the\r\nsystem of artificial memory; count your instructions off after me, on\r\nyour thumb and your four fingers. To-day you tell Mrs. Lecount I have\r\ntried to take you in with my relative\xe2\x80\x99s works of Art. To-morrow you cut\r\nme on the Parade. The day after you refuse to go out, you get tired of\r\nAldborough, and you allow Mrs. Lecount to make her suggestion. The next\r\nday you accept the suggestion. And the next day to that you go to St.\r\nCrux. Once more, my dear sir! Thumb\xe2\x80\x94works of Art. Forefinger\xe2\x80\x94cut me on\r\nthe Parade. Middle finger\xe2\x80\x94tired of Aldborough. Third finger\xe2\x80\x94take\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s advice. Little finger\xe2\x80\x94off to St. Crux. Nothing can be\r\nclearer\xe2\x80\x94nothing can be easier to do. Is there anything you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand? Anything that I can explain over again before you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it settled that I am not to\r\ncome here again before I go to St. Crux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost decidedly!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole success of the\r\nenterprise depends on your keeping away. Mrs. Lecount will try the\r\ncredibility of everything you say to her by one test\xe2\x80\x94the test of your\r\ncommunicating, or not, with this house. She will watch you night and\r\nday! Don\xe2\x80\x99t call here, don\xe2\x80\x99t send messages, don\xe2\x80\x99t write letters; don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven go out by yourself. Let her see you start for St. Crux on her\r\nsuggestion, with the absolute certainty in her own mind that you have\r\nfollowed her advice without communicating it in any form whatever to me\r\nor to my niece. Do that, and she _must_ believe you, on the best of all\r\nevidence for our interests, and the worst for hers\xe2\x80\x94the evidence of her\r\nown senses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those last words of caution, he shook the little man warmly by the\r\nhand and sent him home on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Sea View, Noel Vanstone executed the instructions which\r\nprescribed his line of conduct for the first of the five days with\r\nunimpeachable accuracy. A faint smile of contempt hovered about Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s lips while the story of Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to pass off his\r\nspurious pictures as originals was in progress, but she did not trouble\r\nherself to utter a single word of remark when it had come to an end.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what I said!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Noel Vanstone, cunningly watching her face;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day the meeting occurred on the Parade. Mr. Bygrave took off\r\nhis hat, and Noel Vanstone looked the other way. The captain\xe2\x80\x99s start of\r\nsurprise and scowl of indignation were executed to perfection, but they\r\nplainly failed to impose on Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, sir, you have\r\noffended Mr. Bygrave to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she ironically remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cHappily for\r\nyou, he is an excellent Christian! and I venture to predict that he\r\nwill forgive you to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone wisely refrained from committing himself to an answer.\r\nOnce more he privately applauded his own penetration; once more he\r\ntriumphed over his ingenious friend.\r\n\r\nThus far the captain\xe2\x80\x99s instructions had been too clear and simple to be\r\nmistaken by any one. But they advanced in complication with the advance\r\nof time, and on the third day Noel Vanstone fell confusedly into the\r\ncommission of a slight error. After expressing the necessary weariness\r\nof Aldborough, and the consequent anxiety for change of scene, he was\r\nmet (as he had anticipated) by an immediate suggestion from the\r\nhousekeeper, recommending a visit to St. Crux. In giving his answer to\r\nthe advice thus tendered, he made his first mistake. Instead of\r\ndeferring his decision until the next day, he accepted Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuggestion on the day when it was offered to him.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this error were of no great importance. The\r\nhousekeeper merely set herself to watch her master one day earlier than\r\nhad been calculated on\xe2\x80\x94a result which had been already provided for by\r\nthe wise precautionary measure of forbidding Noel Vanstone all\r\ncommunication with North Shingles. Doubting, as Captain Wragge had\r\nforeseen, the sincerity of her master\xe2\x80\x99s desire to break off his\r\nconnection with the Bygraves by going to St. Crux, Mrs. Lecount tested\r\nthe truth or falsehood of the impression produced on her own mind by\r\nvigilantly watching for signs of secret communication on one side or on\r\nthe other. The close attention with which she had hitherto observed the\r\nout-goings and in-comings at North Shingles was now entirely\r\ntransferred to her master. For the rest of that third day she never let\r\nhim out of her sight; she never allowed any third person who came to\r\nthe house, on any pretense whatever, a minute\xe2\x80\x99s chance of private\r\ncommunication with him. At intervals through the night she stole to the\r\ndoor of his room, to listen and assure herself that he was in bed; and\r\nbefore sunrise the next morning, the coast-guardsman going his rounds\r\nwas surprised to see a lady who had risen as early as himself engaged\r\nover her work at one of the upper windows of Sea View.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth morning Noel Vanstone came down to breakfast conscious of\r\nthe mistake that he had committed on the previous day. The obvious\r\ncourse to take, for the purpose of gaining time, was to declare that\r\nhis mind was still undecided. He made the assertion boldly when the\r\nhousekeeper asked him if he meant to move that day. Again Mrs. Lecount\r\noffered no remark, and again the signs and tokens of incredulity showed\r\nthemselves in her face. Vacillation of purpose was not at all unusual\r\nin her experience of her master. But on this occasion she believed that\r\nhis caprice of conduct was assumed for the purpose of gaining time to\r\ncommunicate with North Shingles, and she accordingly set her watch on\r\nhim once more with doubled and trebled vigilance.\r\n\r\nNo letters came that morning. Toward noon the weather changed for the\r\nworse, and all idea of walking out as usual was abandoned. Hour after\r\nhour, while her master sat in one of the parlors, Mrs. Lecount kept\r\nwatch in the other, with the door into the passage open, and with a\r\nfull view of North Shingles through the convenient side-window at which\r\nshe had established herself. Not a sign that was suspicious appeared,\r\nnot a sound that was suspicious caught her ear. As the evening closed\r\nin, her master\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation came to an end. He was disgusted with the\r\nweather; he hated the place; he foresaw the annoyance of more meetings\r\nwith Mr. Bygrave, and he was determined to go to St. Crux the first\r\nthing the next morning. Lecount could stay behind to pack up the\r\ncuriosities and settle with the trades-people, and could follow him to\r\nthe admiral\xe2\x80\x99s on the next day. The housekeeper was a little staggered\r\nby the tone and manner in which he gave these orders. He had, to her\r\nown certain knowledge, effected no communication of any sort with North\r\nShingles, and yet he seemed determined to leave Aldborough at the\r\nearliest possible opportunity. For the first time she hesitated in her\r\nadherence to her own conclusions. She remembered that her master had\r\ncomplained of the Bygraves before they returned to Aldborough; and she\r\nwas conscious that her own incredulity had once already misled her when\r\nthe appearance of the traveling-carriage at the door had proved even\r\nMr. Bygrave himself to be as good as his word.\r\n\r\nStill Mrs. Lecount determined to act with unrelenting caution to the\r\nlast. That night, when the doors were closed, she privately removed the\r\nkeys from the door in front and the door at the back. She then softly\r\nopened her bedroom window and sat down by it, with her bonnet and cloak\r\non, to prevent her taking cold. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s window was on the same\r\nside of the house as her own. If any one came in the dark to speak to\r\nhim from the garden beneath, they would speak to his housekeeper as\r\nwell. Prepared at all points to intercept every form of clandestine\r\ncommunication which stratagem could invent, Mrs. Lecount watched\r\nthrough the quiet night. When morning came, she stole downstairs before\r\nthe servant was up, restored the keys to their places, and re-occupied\r\nher position in the parlor until Noel Vanstone made his appearance at\r\nthe breakfast-table. Had he altered his mind? No. He declined posting\r\nto the railway on account of the expense, but he was as firm as ever in\r\nhis resolution to go to St. Crux. He desired that an inside place might\r\nbe secured for him in the early coach. Suspicious to the last, Mrs.\r\nLecount sent the baker\xe2\x80\x99s man to take the place. He was a public\r\nservant, and Mr. Bygrave would not suspect him of performing a private\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\nThe coach called at Sea View. Mrs. Lecount saw her master established\r\nin his place, and ascertained that the other three inside seats were\r\nalready occupied by strangers. She inquired of the coachman if the\r\noutside places (all of which were not yet filled up) had their full\r\ncomplement of passengers also. The man replied in the affirmative. He\r\nhad two gentlemen to call for in the town, and the others would take\r\ntheir places at the inn. Mrs. Lecount forthwith turned her steps toward\r\nthe inn, and took up her position on the Parade opposite from a point\r\nof view which would enable her to see the last of the coach on its\r\ndeparture. In ten minutes more it rattled away, full outside and in;\r\nand the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes assured her that neither Mr. Bygrave\r\nhimself, nor any one belonging to North Shingles, was among the\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nThere was only one more precaution to take, and Mrs. Lecount did not\r\nneglect it. Mr. Bygrave had doubtless seen the coach call at Sea View.\r\nHe might hire a carriage and follow it to the railway on pure\r\nspeculation. Mrs. Lecount remained within view of the inn (the only\r\nplace at which a carriage could be obtained) for nearly an hour longer,\r\nwaiting for events. Nothing happened; no carriage made its appearance;\r\nno pursuit of Noel Vanstone was now within the range of human\r\npossibility. The long strain on Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s mind relaxed at last.\r\nShe left her seat on the Parade, and returned in higher spirits than\r\nusual, to perform the closing household ceremonies at Sea View.\r\n\r\nShe sat down alone in the parlor and drew a long breath of relief.\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s calculations had not deceived him. The evidence of her\r\nown senses had at last conquered the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s incredulity, and had\r\nliterally forced her into the opposite extreme of belief.\r\n\r\nEstimating the events of the last three days from her own experience of\r\nthem; knowing (as she certainly knew) that the first idea of going to\r\nSt. Crux had been started by herself, and that her master had found no\r\nopportunity and shown no inclination to inform the family at North\r\nShingles that he had accepted her proposal, Mrs. Lecount was fairly\r\ncompelled to acknowledge that not a fragment of foundation remained to\r\njustify the continued suspicion of treachery in her own mind. Looking\r\nat the succession of circumstances under the new light thrown on them\r\nby results, she could see nothing unaccountable, nothing contradictory\r\nanywhere. The attempt to pass off the forged pictures as originals was\r\nin perfect harmony with the character of such a man as Mr. Bygrave. Her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s indignation at the attempt to impose on him; his\r\nplainly-expressed suspicion that Miss Bygrave was privy to it; his\r\ndisappointment in the niece; his contemptuous treatment of the uncle on\r\nthe Parade; his weariness of the place which had been the scene of his\r\nrash intimacy with strangers, and his readiness to quit it that\r\nmorning, all commended themselves as genuine realities to the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s mind, for one sufficient reason. Her own eyes had seen\r\nNoel Vanstone take his departure from Aldborough without leaving, or\r\nattempting to leave, a single trace behind him for the Bygraves to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThus far the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions led her, but no further. She was\r\ntoo shrewd a woman to trust the future to chance and fortune. Her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s variable temper might relent. Accident might at any time give\r\nMr. Bygrave an opportunity of repairing the error that he had\r\ncommitted, and of artfully regaining his lost place in Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestimation. Admitting that circumstances had at last declared\r\nthemselves unmistakably in her favor, Mrs. Lecount was not the less\r\nconvinced that nothing would permanently assure her master\xe2\x80\x99s security\r\nfor the future but the plain exposure of the conspiracy which she had\r\nstriven to accomplish from the first\xe2\x80\x94which she was resolved to\r\naccomplish still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always enjoy myself at St. Crux,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Lecount, opening her\r\naccount-books, and sorting the tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s bills. \xe2\x80\x9cThe admiral is a\r\ngentleman, the house is noble, the table is excellent. No matter! Here\r\nat Sea View I stay by myself till I have seen the inside of Miss\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe packed her master\xe2\x80\x99s collection of curiosities in their various\r\ncases, settled the claims of the trades-people, and superintended the\r\ncovering of the furniture in the course of the day. Toward nightfall\r\nshe went out, bent on investigation, and ventured into the garden at\r\nNorth Shingles under cover of the darkness. She saw the light in the\r\nparlor window, and the lights in the windows of the rooms upstairs, as\r\nusual. After an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation she stole to the house door, and\r\nnoiselessly tried the handle from the outside. It turned the lock as\r\nshe had expected, from her experience of houses at Aldborough and at\r\nother watering-places, but the door resisted her; the door was\r\ndistrustfully bolted on the inside. After making that discovery, she\r\nwent round to the back of the house, and ascertained that the door on\r\nthat side was secured in the same manner. \xe2\x80\x9cBolt your doors, Mr.\r\nBygrave, as fast as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper, stealing back\r\nagain to the Parade. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t bolt the entrance to your servant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npocket. The best lock you have may be opened by a golden key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went back to bed. The ceaseless watching, the unrelaxing excitement\r\nof the last two days, had worn her out.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she rose at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. In half an hour more she\r\nsaw the punctual Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94as she had seen him on many previous\r\nmornings at the same time\xe2\x80\x94issue from the gate of North Shingles, with\r\nhis towels under his arm, and make his way to a boat that was waiting\r\nfor him on the beach. Swimming was one among the many personal\r\naccomplishments of which the captain was master. He was rowed out to\r\nsea every morning, and took his bath luxuriously in the deep blue\r\nwater. Mrs. Lecount had already computed the time consumed in this\r\nrecreation by her watch, and had discovered that a full hour usually\r\nelapsed from the moment when he embarked on the beach to the moment\r\nwhen he returned.\r\n\r\nDuring that period she had never seen any other inhabitant of North\r\nShingles leave the house. The servant was no doubt at her work in the\r\nkitchen; Mrs. Bygrave was probably still in her bed; and Miss Bygrave\r\n(if she was up at that early hour) had perhaps received directions not\r\nto venture out in her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s absence. The difficulty of meeting the\r\nobstacle of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the house had been, for some days\r\npast, the one difficulty which all Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity had thus\r\nfar proved unable to overcome.\r\n\r\nShe sat at the window for a quarter of an hour after the captain\xe2\x80\x99s boat\r\nhad left the beach with her mind hard at work, and her eyes fixed\r\nmechanically on North Shingles\xe2\x80\x94she sat considering what written excuse\r\nshe could send to her master for delaying her departure from Aldborough\r\nfor some days to come\xe2\x80\x94when the door of the house she was watching\r\nsuddenly opened, and Magdalen herself appeared in the garden. There was\r\nno mistaking her figure and her dress. She took a few steps hastily\r\ntoward the gate, stopped and pulled down the veil of her garden hat as\r\nif she felt the clear morning light too much for her, then hurried out\r\non the Parade and walked away northward, in such haste, or in such\r\npre-occupation of mind, that she went through the garden gate without\r\nclosing it after her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount started up from her chair with a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt of the\r\nevidence of her own eyes. Had the opportunity which she had been vainly\r\nplotting to produce actually offered itself to her of its own accord?\r\nHad the chances declared themselves at last in her favor, after\r\nsteadily acting against her for so long? There was no doubt of it: in\r\nthe popular phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cher luck had turned.\xe2\x80\x9d She snatched up her bonnet\r\nand mantilla, and made for North Shingles without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation. Mr. Bygrave out at sea; Miss Bygrave away for a walk; Mrs.\r\nBygrave and the servant both at home, and both easily dealt with\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nopportunity was not to be lost; the risk was well worth running!\r\n\r\nThis time the house door was easily opened: no one had bolted it again\r\nafter Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s departure. Mrs. Lecount closed the door softly,\r\nlistened for a moment in the passage, and heard the servant noisily\r\noccupied in the kitchen with her pots and pans. \xe2\x80\x9cIf my lucky star leads\r\nme straight into Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s room,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the housekeeper,\r\nstealing noiselessly up the stairs, \xe2\x80\x9cI may find my way to her wardrobe\r\nwithout disturbing anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried the door nearest to the front of the house on the right-hand\r\nside of the landing. Capricious chance had deserted her already. The\r\nlock was turned. She tried the door opposite, on her left hand. The\r\nboots ranged symmetrically in a row, and the razors on the\r\ndressing-table, told her at once that she had not found the right room\r\nyet. She returned to the right-hand side of the landing, walked down a\r\nlittle passage leading to the back of the house, and tried a third\r\ndoor. The door opened, and the two opposite extremes of female\r\nhumanity, Mrs. Wragge and Mrs. Lecount, stood face to face in an\r\ninstant!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg ten thousand pardons!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, with the most\r\nconsummate self-possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless us and save us!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge, with the most helpless\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nThe two exclamations were uttered in a moment, and in that moment Mrs.\r\nLecount took the measure of her victim. Nothing of the least importance\r\nescaped her. She noticed the Oriental Cashmere Robe lying half made,\r\nand half unpicked again, on the table; she noticed the imbecile foot of\r\nMrs. Wragge searching blindly in the neighborhood of her chair for a\r\nlost shoe; she noticed that there was a second door in the room besides\r\nthe door by which she had entered, and a second chair within easy\r\nreach, on which she might do well to seat herself in a friendly and\r\nconfidential way. \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t resent my intrusion,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mrs.\r\nLecount, taking the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cPray allow me to explain myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpeaking in her softest voice, surveying Mrs. Wragge with a sweet smile\r\non her insinuating lips, and a melting interest in her handsome black\r\neyes, the housekeeper told her little introductory series of falsehoods\r\nwith an artless truthfulness of manner which the Father of Lies himself\r\nmight have envied. She had heard from Mr. Bygrave that Mrs. Bygrave was\r\na great invalid; she had constantly reproached herself, in her idle\r\nhalf-hours at Sea View (where she filled the situation of Mr. Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper), for not having offered her friendly services\r\nto Mrs. Bygrave; she had been directed by her master (doubtless well\r\nknown to Mrs. Bygrave, as one of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s friends, and, naturally,\r\none of her charming niece\xe2\x80\x99s admirers), to join him that day at the\r\nresidence to which he had removed from Aldborough; she was obliged to\r\nleave early, but she could not reconcile it to her conscience to go\r\nwithout calling to apologize for her apparent want of neighborly\r\nconsideration; she had found nobody in the house; she had not been able\r\nto make the servant hear; she had presumed (not discovering that\r\napartment downstairs) that Mrs. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir might be on the upper\r\nstory; she had thoughtlessly committed an intrusion of which she was\r\nsincerely ashamed, and she could now only trust to Mrs. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindulgence to excuse and forgive her.\r\n\r\nA less elaborate apology might have served Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s purpose. As\r\nsoon as Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s struggling perceptions had grasped the fact that\r\nher unexpected visitor was a neighbor well known to her by repute, her\r\nwhole being became absorbed in admiration of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s lady-like\r\nmanners, and Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly-fitting gown! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a noble way\r\nshe has of talking!\xe2\x80\x9d thought poor Mrs. Wragge, as the housekeeper\r\nreached her closing sentence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, oh my heart alive, how nicely she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see I disturb you,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs. Lecount, artfully availing herself\r\nof the Oriental Cashmere Robe as a means ready at hand of reaching the\r\nend she had in view\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI see I disturb you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, over an occupation\r\nwhich, I know by experience, requires the closest attention. Dear, dear\r\nme, you are unpicking the dress again, I see, after it has been made!\r\nThis is my own experience again, Mrs. Bygrave. Some dresses are so\r\nobstinate! Some dresses seem to say to one, in so many words, \xe2\x80\x98No! you\r\nmay do what you like with me; I won\xe2\x80\x99t fit!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge was greatly struck by this happy remark. She burst out\r\nlaughing, and clapped her great hands in hearty approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what this gown has been saying to me ever since I first put the\r\nscissors into it,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an awful\r\nbig back, but that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason. Why should a gown be weeks on hand, and\r\nthen not meet behind you after all? It hangs over my Boasom like a\r\nsack\xe2\x80\x94it does. Look here, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, at the skirt. It won\xe2\x80\x99t come right. It\r\ndraggles in front, and cocks up behind. It shows my heels\xe2\x80\x94and, Lord\r\nknows, I get into scrapes enough about my heels, without showing them\r\ninto the bargain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask a favor?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs. Lecount, confidentially. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I try,\r\nMrs. Bygrave, if I can make my experience of any use to you? I think\r\nour bosoms, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, are our great difficulty. Now, this bosom of\r\nyours?\xe2\x80\x94Shall I say in plain words what I think? This bosom of yours is\r\nan Enormous Mistake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge, imploringly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t please,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a good soul! It\xe2\x80\x99s an awful big one, I know; but it\xe2\x80\x99s modeled,\r\nfor all that, from one of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was far too deeply interested on the subject of the dress to notice\r\nthat she had forgotten herself already, and that she had referred to\r\nMagdalen by her own name. Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s sharp ears detected the\r\nmistake the instant it was committed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo! so!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\ndiscovery already. If I had ever doubted my own suspicions, here is an\r\nestimable lady who would now have set me right.\xe2\x80\x94I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nproceeded, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you say this was modeled from one of your\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s dresses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as like as two peas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Lecount, adroitly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be some serious\r\nmistake in the making of your niece\xe2\x80\x99s dress. Can you show it to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your heart\xe2\x80\x94yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cStep this way, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; and\r\nbring the gown along with you, please. It keeps sliding off, out of\r\npure aggravation, if you lay it out on the table. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of room\r\non the bed in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened the door of communication and led the way eagerly into\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s room. As Mrs. Lecount followed, she stole a look at her\r\nwatch. Never before had time flown as it flew that morning! In twenty\r\nminutes more Mr. Bygrave would be back from his bath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, throwing open the wardrobe, and taking a\r\ndress down from one of the pegs. \xe2\x80\x9cLook there! There\xe2\x80\x99s plaits on her\r\nBoasom, and plaits on mine. Six of one and half a dozen of the other;\r\nand mine are the biggest\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount shook her head gravely, and entered forthwith into\r\nsubtleties of disquisition on the art of dressmaking which had the\r\ndesired effect of utterly bewildering the proprietor of the Oriental\r\nCashmere Robe in less than three minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge, imploringly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go on like that! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nmiles behind you; and my head\xe2\x80\x99s Buzzing already. Tell us, like a good\r\nsoul, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done. You said something about the pattern just now.\r\nPerhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m too big for the pattern? I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it if I am. Many\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe good cry I had, when I was a growing girl, over my own size!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s half too much of me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94measure me along or measure me\r\nacross, I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s half too much of me, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear madam,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do yourself a wrong!\r\nPermit me to assure you that you possess a commanding figure\xe2\x80\x94a figure\r\nof Minerva. A majestic simplicity in the form of a woman imperatively\r\ndemands a majestic simplicity in the form of that woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress. The\r\nlaws of costume are classical; the laws of costume must not be trifled\r\nwith! Plaits for Venus, puffs for Juno, folds for Minerva. I venture to\r\nsuggest a total change of pattern. Your niece has other dresses in her\r\ncollection. Why may we not find a Minerva pattern among them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she said those words, she led the way back to the wardrobe.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge followed, and took the dresses out one by one, shaking her\r\nhead despondently. Silk dresses appeared, muslin dresses appeared. The\r\none dress which remained invisible was the dress of which Mrs. Lecount\r\nwas in search.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the lot of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cThey may do for Venus and\r\nthe two other Ones (I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen \xe2\x80\x99em in picters without a morsel of decent\r\nlinen among the three), but they won\xe2\x80\x99t do for Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely there is another dress left?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, pointing to\r\nthe wardrobe, but touching nothing in it. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely I see something\r\nhanging in the corner behind that dark shawl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge removed the shawl; Mrs. Lecount opened the door of the\r\nwardrobe a little wider. There\xe2\x80\x94hitched carelessly on the innermost\r\npeg\xe2\x80\x94there, with its white spots, and its double flounce, was the brown\r\nAlpaca dress!\r\n\r\nThe suddenness and completeness of the discovery threw the housekeeper,\r\npracticed dissembler as she was, completely off her guard. She started\r\nat the sight of the dress. The instant afterward her eyes turned\r\nuneasily toward Mrs. Wragge. Had the start been observed? It had passed\r\nentirely unnoticed. Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s whole attention was fixed on the\r\nAlpaca dress: she was staring at it incomprehensibly, with an\r\nexpression of the utmost dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem alarmed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there in the\r\nwardrobe to frighten you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have given a crown piece out of my pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, \xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nto have set my eyes on that gown. It had gone clean out of my head, and\r\nnow it\xe2\x80\x99s come back again. Cover it up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Wragge, throwing the\r\nshawl over the dress in a sudden fit of desperation. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I look at it\r\nmuch longer, I shall think I\xe2\x80\x99m back again in Vauxhall Walk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVauxhall Walk! Those two words told Mrs. Lecount she was on the brink\r\nof another discovery. She stole a second look at her watch. There was\r\nbarely ten minutes to spare before the time when Mr. Bygrave might\r\nreturn; there was not one of those ten minutes which might not bring\r\nhis niece back to the house. Caution counseled Mrs. Lecount to go,\r\nwithout running any more risks. Curiosity rooted her to the spot, and\r\ngave the courage to stay at all hazards until the time was up. Her\r\namiable smile began to harden a little as she probed her way tenderly\r\ninto Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s feeble mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have some unpleasant remembrances of Vauxhall Walk?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwith the gentlest possible tone of inquiry in her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOr perhaps I\r\nshould say, unpleasant remembrances of that dress belonging to your\r\nniece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I saw her with that gown on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, dropping\r\ninto a chair and beginning to tremble, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the time when I came back\r\nfrom shopping and saw the Ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ghost?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Lecount, clasping her hands in graceful\r\nastonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cDear madam, pardon me! Is there such a thing in the\r\nworld? Where did you see it? In Vauxhall Walk? Tell me\xe2\x80\x94you are the\r\nfirst lady I ever met with who has seen a ghost\xe2\x80\x94pray tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlattered by the position of importance which she had suddenly assumed\r\nin the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, Mrs. Wragge entered at full length into the\r\nnarrative of her supernatural adventure. The breathless eagerness with\r\nwhich Mrs. Lecount listened to her description of the specter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncostume, the specter\xe2\x80\x99s hurry on the stairs, and the specter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisappearance in the bedroom; the extraordinary interest which Mrs.\r\nLecount displayed on hearing that the dress in the wardrobe was the\r\nvery dress in which Magdalen happened to be attired at the awful moment\r\nwhen the ghost vanished, encouraged Mrs. Wragge to wade deeper and\r\ndeeper into details, and to involve herself in a confusion of\r\ncollateral circumstances out of which there seemed to be no prospect of\r\nher emerging for hours to come. Faster and faster the inexorable\r\nminutes flew by; nearer and nearer came the fatal moment of Mr.\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x99s return. Mrs. Lecount looked at her watch for the third time,\r\nwithout an attempt on this occasion to conceal the action from her\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s notice. There were literally two minutes left for her to\r\nget clear of North Shingles. Two minutes would be enough, if no\r\naccident happened. She had discovered the Alpaca dress; she had heard\r\nthe whole story of the adventure in Vauxhall Walk; and, more than that,\r\nshe had even informed herself of the number of the house\xe2\x80\x94which Mrs.\r\nWragge happened to remember, because it answered to the number of years\r\nin her own age. All that was necessary to her master\xe2\x80\x99s complete\r\nenlightenment she had now accomplished. Even if there had been time to\r\nstay longer, there was nothing worth staying for. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll strike this\r\nworthy idiot dumb with a _coup d\xe2\x80\x99etat_,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the housekeeper, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nvanish before she recovers herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Lecount, interrupting the ghostly narrative by a\r\nshrill little scream and making for the door, to Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunutterable astonishment, without the least ceremony. \xe2\x80\x9cYou freeze the\r\nvery marrow of my bones. Good-morning!\xe2\x80\x9d She coolly tossed the Oriental\r\nCashmere Robe into Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s expansive lap and left the room in an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nAs she swiftly descended the stairs, she heard the door of the bedroom\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are your manners?\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice from above, hailing her feebly\r\nover the banisters. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by pitching my gown at me in that\r\nway? You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs. Wragge, turning\r\nfrom a lamb to a lioness, as she gradually realized the indignity\r\noffered to the Cashmere Robe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou nasty foreigner, you ought to be\r\nashamed of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPursued by this valedictory address, Mrs. Lecount reached the house\r\ndoor, and opened it without interruption. She glided rapidly along the\r\ngarden path, passed through the gate, and finding herself safe on the\r\nParade, stopped, and looked toward the sea.\r\n\r\nThe first object which her eyes encountered was the figure of Mr.\r\nBygrave standing motionless on the beach\xe2\x80\x94a petrified bather, with his\r\ntowels in his hand! One glance at him was enough to show that he had\r\nseen the housekeeper passing out through his garden gate.\r\n\r\nRightly conjecturing that Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse would lead him to\r\nmake instant inquiries in his own house, Mrs. Lecount pursued her way\r\nback to Sea View as composedly as if nothing had happened. When she\r\nentered the parlor where her solitary breakfast was waiting for her,\r\nshe was surprised to see a letter lying on the table. She approached to\r\ntake it up with an expression of impatience, thinking it might be some\r\ntradesman\xe2\x80\x99s bill which she had forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt was the forged letter from Zurich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nThe postmark and the handwriting on the address (admirably imitated\r\nfrom the original) warned Mrs. Lecount of the contents of the letter\r\nbefore she opened it.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a moment to compose herself, she read the announcement of\r\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s relapse.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the handwriting, there was no expression in any\r\npart of the letter which could suggest to her mind the faintest\r\nsuspicion of foul play. Not the shadow of a doubt occurred to her that\r\nthe summons to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s bedside was genuine. The hand that held\r\nthe letter dropped heavily into her lap; she became pale, and old, and\r\nhaggard in a moment. Thoughts, far removed from her present aims and\r\ninterests; remembrances that carried her back to other lands than\r\nEngland, to other times than the time of her life in service, prolonged\r\ntheir inner shadows to the surface, and showed the traces of their\r\nmysterious passage darkly on her face. The minutes followed each other,\r\nand still the servant below stairs waited vainly for the parlor bell.\r\nThe minutes followed each other, and still she sat, tearless and quiet,\r\ndead to the present and the future, living in the past.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the servant, uncalled, roused her. With a heavy sigh,\r\nthe cold and secret woman folded the letter up again and addressed\r\nherself to the interests and the duties of the passing time.\r\n\r\nShe decided the question of going or not going to Zurich, after a very\r\nbrief consideration of it. Before she had drawn her chair to the\r\nbreakfast-table she had resolved to go.\r\n\r\nAdmirably as Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s stratagem had worked, it might have\r\nfailed\xe2\x80\x94unassisted by the occurrence of the morning\xe2\x80\x94to achieve this\r\nresult. The very accident against which it had been the captain\xe2\x80\x99s chief\r\nanxiety to guard\xe2\x80\x94the accident which had just taken place in spite of\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94was, of all the events that could have happened, the one event\r\nwhich falsified every previous calculation, by directly forwarding the\r\nmain purpose of the conspiracy! If Mrs. Lecount had not obtained the\r\ninformation of which she was in search before the receipt of the letter\r\nfrom Zurich, the letter might have addressed her in vain. She would\r\nhave hesitated before deciding to leave England, and that hesitation\r\nmight have proved fatal to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s scheme.\r\n\r\nAs it was, with the plain proofs in her possession, with the gown\r\ndiscovered in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe, with the piece cut out of it in her\r\nown pocketbook, and with the knowledge, obtained from Mrs. Wragge, of\r\nthe very house in which the disguise had been put on, Mrs. Lecount had\r\nnow at her command the means of warning Noel Vanstone as she had never\r\nbeen able to warn him yet, or, in other words, the means of guarding\r\nagainst any dangerous tendencies toward reconciliation with the\r\nBygraves which might otherwise have entered his mind during her absence\r\nat Zurich. The only difficulty which now perplexed her was the\r\ndifficulty of deciding whether she should communicate with her master\r\npersonally or by writing, before her departure from England.\r\n\r\nShe looked again at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s letter. The word \xe2\x80\x9cinstantly,\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\nsentence which summoned her to her dying brother, was twice underlined.\r\nAdmiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s house was at some distance from the railway; the time\r\nconsumed in driving to St. Crux, and driving back again, might be time\r\nfatally lost on the journey to Zurich. Although she would infinitely\r\nhave preferred a personal interview with Noel Vanstone, there was no\r\nchoice on a matter of life and death but to save the precious hours by\r\nwriting to him.\r\n\r\nAfter sending to secure a place at once in the early coach, she sat\r\ndown to write to her master.\r\n\r\nHer first thought was to tell him all that had happened at North\r\nShingles that morning. On reflection, however, she rejected the idea.\r\nOnce already (in copying the personal description from Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter) she had trusted her weapons in her master\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and Mr.\r\nBygrave had contrived to turn them against her. She resolved this time\r\nto keep them strictly in her own possession. The secret of the missing\r\nfragment of the Alpaca dress was known to no living creature but\r\nherself; and, until her return to England, she determined to keep it to\r\nherself. The necessary impression might be produced on Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind without venturing into details. She knew by experience the form of\r\nletter which might be trusted to produce an effect on him, and she now\r\nwrote it in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. NOEL\xe2\x80\x94Sad news has reached me from Switzerland. My beloved\r\nbrother is dying and his medical attendant summons me instantly to\r\nZurich. The serious necessity of availing myself of the earliest means\r\nof conveyance to the Continent leaves me but one alternative. I must\r\nprofit by the permission to leave England, if necessary, which you\r\nkindly granted to me at the beginning of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s illness, and I\r\nmust avoid all delay by going straight to London, instead of turning\r\naside, as I should have liked, to see you first at St. Crux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPainfully as I am affected by the family calamity which has fallen on\r\nme, I cannot let this opportunity pass without adverting to another\r\nsubject which seriously concerns your welfare, and in which (on that\r\naccount) your old housekeeper feels the deepest interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to surprise and shock you, Mr. Noel. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nagitated! pray compose yourself!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe impudent attempt to cheat you, which has happily opened your eyes\r\nto the true character of our neighbors at North Shingles, was not the\r\nonly object which Mr. Bygrave had in forcing himself on your\r\nacquaintance. The infamous conspiracy with which you were threatened in\r\nLondon has been in full progress against you under Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirection, at Aldborough. Accident\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you what accident when\r\nwe meet\xe2\x80\x94has put me in possession of information precious to your future\r\nsecurity. I have discovered, to an absolute certainty, that the person\r\ncalling herself Miss Bygrave is no other than the woman who visited us\r\nin disguise at Vauxhall Walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspected this from the first, but I had no evidence to support my\r\nsuspicions; I had no means of combating the false impression produced\r\non you. My hands, I thank Heaven, are tied no longer. I possess\r\nabsolute proof of the assertion that I have just made\xe2\x80\x94proof that your\r\nown eyes can see\xe2\x80\x94proof that would satisfy you, if you were judge in a\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps even yet, Mr. Noel, you will refuse to believe me? Be it so.\r\nBelieve me or not, I have one last favor to ask, which your English\r\nsense of fair play will not deny me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis melancholy journey of mine will keep me away from England for a\r\nfortnight, or, at most, for three weeks. You will oblige me\xe2\x80\x94and you\r\nwill certainly not sacrifice your own convenience and pleasure\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nstaying through that interval with your friends at St. Crux. If, before\r\nmy return, some unexpected circumstance throws you once more into the\r\ncompany of the Bygraves, and if your natural kindness of heart inclines\r\nyou to receive the excuses which they will, in that case, certainly\r\naddress to you, place one trifling restraint on yourself, for your own\r\nsake, if not for mine. Suspend your flirtation with the young lady (I\r\nbeg pardon of all other young ladies for calling her so!) until my\r\nreturn. If, when I come back, I fail to prove to you that Miss Bygrave\r\nis the woman who wore that disguise, and used those threatening words,\r\nin Vauxhall Wall, I will engage to leave your service at a day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotice; and I will atone for the sin of bearing false witness against\r\nmy neighbor by resigning every claim I have to your grateful\r\nremembrance, on your father\xe2\x80\x99s account as well as on your own. I make\r\nthis engagement without reserves of any kind; and I promise to abide by\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94if my proofs fail\xe2\x80\x94on the faith of a good Catholic, and the word of\r\nan honest woman. Your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVIRGINIE LECOUNT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing sentences of this letter\xe2\x80\x94as the housekeeper well knew when\r\nshe wrote them\xe2\x80\x94embodied the one appeal to Noel Vanstone which could be\r\ncertainly trusted to produce a deep and lasting effect. She might have\r\nstaked her oath, her life, or her reputation, on proving the assertion\r\nwhich she had made, and have failed to leave a permanent impression on\r\nhis mind. But when she staked not only her position in his service, but\r\nher pecuniary claims on him as well, she at once absorbed the ruling\r\npassion of his life in expectation of the result. There was not a doubt\r\nof it, in the strongest of all his interests\xe2\x80\x94the interest of saving his\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94he would wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheckmate for Mr. Bygrave!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Lecount, as she sealed and\r\ndirected the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe battle is over\xe2\x80\x94the game is played out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Lecount was providing for her master\xe2\x80\x99s future security at\r\nSea View, events were in full progress at North Shingles.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Captain Wragge recovered his astonishment at the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on his own premises, he hurried into the\r\nhouse, and, guided by his own forebodings of the disaster that had\r\nhappened, made straight for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nNever, in all her former experience, had poor Mrs. Wragge felt the full\r\nweight of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s indignation as she felt it now. All the little\r\nintelligence she naturally possessed vanished at once in the whirlwind\r\nof her husband\xe2\x80\x99s rage. The only plain facts which he could extract from\r\nher were two in number. In the first place, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s rash desertion\r\nof her post proved to have no better reason to excuse it than\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s incorrigible impatience: she had passed a sleepless night;\r\nshe had risen feverish and wretched; and she had gone out, reckless of\r\nall consequences, to cool her burning head in the fresh air. In the\r\nsecond place, Mrs. Wragge had, on her own confession, seen Mrs.\r\nLecount, had talked with Mrs. Lecount, and had ended by telling Mrs.\r\nLecount the story of the ghost. Having made these discoveries, Captain\r\nWragge wasted no time in contending with his wife\xe2\x80\x99s terror and\r\nconfusion. He withdrew at once to a window which commanded an\r\nuninterrupted prospect of Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s house, and there established\r\nhimself on the watch for events at Sea View, precisely as Mrs. Lecount\r\nhad established herself on the watch for events at North Shingles.\r\n\r\nNot a word of comment on the disaster of the morning escaped him when\r\nMagdalen returned and found him at his post. His flow of language\r\nseemed at last to have run dry. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you what Mrs. Wragge would do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cand Mrs. Wragge has done it.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat unflinchingly at the\r\nwindow with a patience which Mrs. Lecount herself could not have\r\nsurpassed. The one active proceeding in which he seemed to think it\r\nnecessary to engage was performed by deputy. He sent the servant to the\r\ninn to hire a chaise and a fast horse, and to say that he would call\r\nhimself before noon that day and tell the hostler when the vehicle\r\nwould be wanted. Not a sign of impatience escaped him until the time\r\ndrew near for the departure of the early coach. Then the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncurly lips began to twitch with anxiety, and the captain\xe2\x80\x99s restless\r\nfingers beat the devil\xe2\x80\x99s tattoo unremittingly on the window-pane.\r\n\r\nThe coach appeared at last, and drew up at Sea View. In a minute more,\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s own observation informed him that one among the\r\npassengers who left Aldborough that morning was\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nThe main uncertainty disposed of, a serious question\xe2\x80\x94suggested by the\r\nevents of the morning\xe2\x80\x94still remained to be solved. Which was the\r\ndestined end of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s journey\xe2\x80\x94Zurich or St. Crux? That she\r\nwould certainly inform her master of Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s ghost story, and of\r\nevery other disclosure in relation to names and places which might have\r\nescaped Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s lips, was beyond all doubt. But of the two ways\r\nat her disposal of doing the mischief\xe2\x80\x94either personally or by letter\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas vitally important to the captain to know which she had chosen. If\r\nshe had gone to the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s, no choice would be left him but to\r\nfollow the coach, to catch the train by which she traveled, and to\r\noutstrip her afterward on the drive from the station in Essex to St.\r\nCrux. If, on the contrary, she had been contented with writing to her\r\nmaster, it would only be necessary to devise measures for intercepting\r\nthe letter. The captain decided on going to the post-office, in the\r\nfirst place. Assuming that the housekeeper had written, she would not\r\nhave left the letter at the mercy of the servant\xe2\x80\x94she would have seen it\r\nsafely in the letter-box before leaving Aldborough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, cheerfully addressing the postmaster.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Mr. Bygrave of North Shingles. I think you have a letter in the\r\nbox, addressed to Mr.\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe postmaster was a short man, and consequently a man with a proper\r\nidea of his own importance. He solemnly checked Captain Wragge in full\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a letter is once posted, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnobody out of the office\r\nhas any business with it until it reaches its address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain was not a man to be daunted, even by a postmaster. A bright\r\nidea struck him. He took out his pocketbook, in which Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naddress was written, and returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose a letter has been wrongly directed by mistake?\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nsuppose the writer wants to correct the error after the letter is put\r\ninto the box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a letter is once posted, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated the impenetrable local\r\nauthority, \xe2\x80\x9cnobody out of the office touches it on any pretense\r\nwhatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted, with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\ntouch it\xe2\x80\x94I only want to explain myself. A lady has posted a letter\r\nhere, addressed to \xe2\x80\x98Noel Vanstone, Esq., Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s, St.\r\nCrux-in-the-Marsh, Essex.\xe2\x80\x99 She wrote in a great hurry, and she is not\r\nquite certain whether she added the name of the post-town, \xe2\x80\x98Ossory.\xe2\x80\x99 It\r\nis of the last importance that the delivery of the letter should not be\r\ndelayed. What is to hinder your facilitating the post-office work, and\r\nobliging a lady, by adding the name of the post-town (if it happens to\r\nbe left out), with your own hand? I put it to you as a zealous officer,\r\nwhat possible objection can there be to granting my request?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe postmaster was compelled to acknowledge that there could be no\r\nobjection, provided nothing but a necessary line was added to the\r\naddress, provided nobody touched the letter but himself, and provided\r\nthe precious time of the post-office was not suffered to run to waste.\r\nAs there happened to be nothing particular to do at that moment, he\r\nwould readily oblige the lady at Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s request.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge watched the postmaster\xe2\x80\x99s hands, as they sorted the\r\nletters in the box, with breathless eagerness. Was the letter there?\r\nWould the hands of the zealous public servant suddenly stop? Yes! They\r\nstopped, and picked out a letter from the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Noel Vanstone, Esquire,\xe2\x80\x99 did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the postmaster, keeping\r\nthe letter in his own hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Noel Vanstone, Esquire,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nSt. Crux-in-the-Marsh.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOssory, Essex,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in the postmaster, throwing the letter back\r\ninto the box. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lady has made no mistake, sir. The address is quite\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing but a timely consideration of the heavy debt he owed to\r\nappearances prevented Captain Wragge from throwing his tall white hat\r\nup in the air as soon as he found the street once more. All further\r\ndoubt was now at an end. Mrs. Lecount had written to her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x94therefore Mrs. Lecount was on her way to Zurich!\r\n\r\nWith his head higher than ever, with the tails of his respectable\r\nfrock-coat floating behind him in the breeze, with his bosom\xe2\x80\x99s native\r\nimpudence sitting lightly on its throne, the captain strutted to the\r\ninn and called for the railway time-table. After making certain\r\ncalculations (in black and white, as a matter of course), he ordered\r\nhis chaise to be ready in an hour\xe2\x80\x94so as to reach the railway in time\r\nfor the second train running to London\xe2\x80\x94with which there happened to be\r\nno communication from Aldborough by coach.\r\n\r\nHis next proceeding was of a far more serious kind; his next proceeding\r\nimplied a terrible certainty of success. The day of the week was\r\nThursday. From the inn he went to the church, saw the clerk, and gave\r\nthe necessary notice for a marriage by license on the following Monday.\r\n\r\nBold as he was, his nerves were a little shaken by this last\r\nachievement; his hand trembled as it lifted the latch of the garden\r\ngate. He doctored his nerves with brandy and water before he sent for\r\nMagdalen to inform her of the proceedings of the morning. Another\r\noutbreak might reasonably be expected when she heard that the last\r\nirrevocable step had been taken, and that notice had been given of the\r\nwedding-day.\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s watch warned him to lose no time in emptying his glass.\r\nIn a few minutes he sent the necessary message upstairs. While waiting\r\nfor Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, he provided himself with certain materials\r\nwhich were now necessary to carry the enterprise to its crowning point.\r\nIn the first place, he wrote his assumed name (by no means in so fine a\r\nhand as usual) on a blank visiting-card, and added underneath these\r\nwords: \xe2\x80\x9cNot a moment is to be lost. I am waiting for you at the\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94come down to me directly.\xe2\x80\x9d His next proceeding was to take some\r\nhalf-dozen envelopes out of the case, and to direct them all alike to\r\nthe following address: \xe2\x80\x9cThomas Bygrave, Esq., Mussared\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel,\r\nSalisbury Street, Strand, London.\xe2\x80\x9d After carefully placing the\r\nenvelopes and the card in his breast-pocket, he shut up the desk. As he\r\nrose from the writing-table, Magdalen came into the room.\r\n\r\nThe captain took a moment to decide on the best method of opening the\r\ninterview, and determined, in his own phrase, to dash at it. In two\r\nwords he told Magdalen what had happened, and informed her that Monday\r\nwas to be her wedding-day.\r\n\r\nHe was prepared to quiet her, if she burst into a frenzy of passion; to\r\nreason with her, if she begged for time; to sympathize with her, if she\r\nmelted into tears. To his inexpressible surprise, results falsified all\r\nhis calculations. She heard him without uttering a word, without\r\nshedding a tear. When he had done, she dropped into a chair. Her large\r\ngray eyes stared at him vacantly. In one mysterious instant all her\r\nbeauty left her; her face stiffened awfully, like the face of a corpse.\r\nFor the first time in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s experience of her,\r\nfear\xe2\x80\x94all-mastering fear\xe2\x80\x94had taken possession of her, body and soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not flinching,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying to rouse her. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely you are\r\nnot flinching at the last moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo light of intelligence came into her eyes, no change passed over her\r\nface. But she heard him\xe2\x80\x94for she moved a little in the chair, and slowly\r\nshook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou planned this marriage of your own freewill,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the captain,\r\nwith the furtive look and the faltering voice of a man ill at ease. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas your own idea\xe2\x80\x94not mine. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have the responsibility laid on my\r\nshoulders\xe2\x80\x94no! not for twice two hundred pounds. If your resolution\r\nfails you; if you think better of it\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Her face was changing; her lips were moving at last. She\r\nslowly raised her left hand, with the fingers outspread; she looked at\r\nit as if it was a hand that was strange to her; she counted the days on\r\nit, the days before the marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriday, one,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday, two; Sunday, three;\r\nMonday\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Her hands dropped into her lap, her face stiffened again; the\r\ndeadly fear fastened its paralyzing hold on her once more, and the next\r\nwords died away on her lips.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn the two hundred pounds!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo thousand wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay me\r\nfor this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put the handkerchief back, took the envelopes which he had addressed\r\nto himself out of his pocket, and, approaching her closely for the\r\nfirst time, laid his hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRouse yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a last word to say to you. Can you\r\nlisten?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe struggled, and roused herself\xe2\x80\x94a faint tinge of color stole over her\r\nwhite cheeks\xe2\x80\x94she bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at these,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Captain Wragge, holding up the envelopes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nI turn these to the use for which they have been written, Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s master will never receive Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s letter. If I tear\r\nthem up, he will know by to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s post that you are the woman who\r\nvisited him in Vauxhall Walk. Say the word! Shall I tear the envelopes\r\nup, or shall I put them back in my pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of dead silence. The murmur of the summer waves on\r\nthe shingle of the beach and the voices of the summer idlers on the\r\nParade floated through the open window, and filled the empty stillness\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nShe raised her head; she lifted her hand and pointed steadily to the\r\nenvelopes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut them back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she gave that answer, there was a sound of wheels on the road\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear those wheels?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see the chaise?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, pointing through the window as\r\nthe chaise which had been ordered from the inn made its appearance at\r\nthe garden gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, of your own free-will, you tell me to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout another word he left her. The servant was waiting at the door\r\nwith his traveling bag. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bygrave is not well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell your\r\nmistress to go to her in the parlor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped into the chaise, and started on the first stage of the\r\njourney to St. Crux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nToward three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon Captain Wragge stopped at the\r\nnearest station to Ossory which the railway passed in its course\r\nthrough Essex. Inquiries made on the spot informed him that he might\r\ndrive to St. Crux, remain there for a quarter of an hour, and return to\r\nthe station in time for an evening train to London. In ten minutes more\r\nthe captain was on the road again, driving rapidly in the direction of\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding some miles on the highway, the carriage turned off,\r\nand the coachman involved himself in an intricate network of\r\ncross-roads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we far from St. Crux?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain, growing impatient, after\r\nmile on mile had been passed without a sign of reaching the journey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see the house, sir, at the next turn in the road,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe next turn in the road brought them within view of the open country\r\nagain. Ahead of the carriage, Captain Wragge saw a long dark line\r\nagainst the sky\xe2\x80\x94the line of the sea-wall which protects the low coast\r\nof Essex from inundation. The flat intermediate country was intersected\r\nby a labyrinth of tidal streams, winding up from the invisible sea in\r\nstrange fantastic curves\xe2\x80\x94rivers at high water, and channels of mud at\r\nlow. On his right hand was a quaint little village, mostly composed of\r\nwooden houses, straggling down to the brink of one of the tidal\r\nstreams. On his left hand, further away, rose the gloomy ruins of an\r\nabbey, with a desolate pile of buildings, which covered two sides of a\r\nsquare attached to it. One of the streams from the sea (called, in\r\nEssex, \xe2\x80\x9cbackwaters\xe2\x80\x9d) curled almost entirely round the house. Another,\r\nfrom an opposite quarter, appeared to run straight through the grounds,\r\nand to separate one side of the shapeless mass of buildings, which was\r\nin moderate repair, from another, which was little better than a ruin.\r\nBridges of wood and bridges of brick crossed the stream, and gave\r\naccess to the house from all points of the compass. No human creature\r\nappeared in the neighborhood, and no sound was heard but the hoarse\r\nbarking of a house-dog from an invisible courtyard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich door shall I drive to, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the coachman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe front or\r\nthe back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, feeling that the less notice he\r\nattracted in his present position, the safer that position might be.\r\n\r\nThe carriage twice crossed the stream before the coachman made his way\r\nthrough the grounds into a dreary inclosure of stone. At an open door\r\non the inhabited side of the place sat a weather-beaten old man, busily\r\nat work on a half-finished model of a ship. He rose and came to the\r\ncarriage door, lifting up his spectacles on his forehead, and looking\r\ndisconcerted at the appearance of a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Noel Vanstone staying here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Noel came yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that card to Mr. Vanstone, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nsay I am waiting here to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Noel Vanstone made his appearance, breathless and\r\neager\xe2\x80\x94absorbed in anxiety for news from Aldborough. Captain Wragge\r\nopened the carriage door, seized his outstretched hand, and pulled him\r\nin without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour housekeeper has gone,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand you are to be\r\nmarried on Monday. Don\xe2\x80\x99t agitate yourself, and don\xe2\x80\x99t express your\r\nfeelings\xe2\x80\x94there isn\xe2\x80\x99t time for it. Get the first active servant you can\r\nfind in the house to pack your bag in ten minutes, take leave of the\r\nadmiral, and come back at once with me to the London train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone faintly attempted to ask a question. The captain declined\r\nto hear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much talk as you like on the road,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTime is too precious\r\nfor talking here. How do we know Lecount may not think better of it?\r\nHow do we know she may not turn back before she gets to Zurich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat startling consideration terrified Noel Vanstone into instant\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say to the admiral?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him you are going to be married, to be sure! What does it matter,\r\nnow Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s back is turned? If he wonders you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him before,\r\nsay it\xe2\x80\x99s a runaway match, and the bride is waiting for you. Stop! Any\r\nletters addressed to you in your absence will be sent to this place, of\r\ncourse? Give the admiral these envelopes, and tell him to forward your\r\nletters under cover to me. I am an old customer at the hotel we are\r\ngoing to; and if we find the place full, the landlord may be depended\r\non to take care of any letters with my name on them. A safe address in\r\nLondon for your correspondence may be of the greatest importance. How\r\ndo we know Lecount may not write to you on her way to Zurich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a head you have got!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, eagerly taking the\r\nenvelopes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the carriage in high excitement, and ran back into the house.\r\nIn ten minutes more Captain Wragge had him in safe custody, and the\r\nhorses started on their return journey.\r\n\r\nThe travelers reached London in good time that evening, and found\r\naccommodation at the hotel.\r\n\r\nKnowing the restless, inquisitive nature of the man he had to deal\r\nwith, Captain Wragge had anticipated some little difficulty and\r\nembarrassment in meeting the questions which Noel Vanstone might put to\r\nhim on the way to London. To his great relief, a startling domestic\r\ndiscovery absorbed his traveling companion\xe2\x80\x99s whole attention at the\r\noutset of the journey. By some extraordinary oversight, Miss Bygrave\r\nhad been left, on the eve of her marriage, unprovided with a maid. Noel\r\nVanstone declared that he would take the whole responsibility of\r\ncorrecting this deficiency in the arrangements, on his own shoulders;\r\nhe would not trouble Mr. Bygrave to give him any assistance; he would\r\nconfer, when they got to their journey\xe2\x80\x99s end, with the landlady of the\r\nhotel, and would examine the candidates for the vacant office himself.\r\nAll the way to London, he returned again and again to the same subject;\r\nall the evening, at the hotel, he was in and out of the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting-room, until he fairly obliged her to lock the door. In every\r\nother proceeding which related to his marriage, he had been kept in the\r\nbackground; he had been compelled to follow in the footsteps of his\r\ningenious friend. In the matter of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid he claimed his\r\nfitting position at last\xe2\x80\x94he followed nobody; he took the lead!\r\n\r\nThe forenoon of the next day was devoted to obtaining the license\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npersonal distinction of making the declaration on oath being eagerly\r\naccepted by Noel Vanstone, who swore, in perfect good faith (on\r\ninformation previously obtained from the captain) that the lady was of\r\nage. The document procured, the bridegroom returned to examine the\r\ncharacters and qualifications of the women-servants out of the place\r\nwhom the landlady had engaged to summon to the hotel, while Captain\r\nWragge turned his steps, \xe2\x80\x9con business personal to himself,\xe2\x80\x9d toward the\r\nresidence of a friend in a distant quarter of London.\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s friend was connected with the law, and the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness was of a twofold nature. His first object was to inform\r\nhimself of the legal bearings of the approaching marriage on the future\r\nof the husband and the wife. His second object was to provide\r\nbeforehand for destroying all traces of the destination to which he\r\nmight betake himself when he left Aldborough on the wedding-day. Having\r\nreached his end successfully in both these cases, he returned to the\r\nhotel, and found Noel Vanstone nursing his offended dignity in the\r\nlandlady\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room. Three ladies\xe2\x80\x99 maids had appeared to pass their\r\nexamination, and had all, on coming to the question of wages,\r\nimpudently declined accepting the place. A fourth candidate was\r\nexpected to present herself on the next day; and, until she made her\r\nappearance, Noel Vanstone positively declined removing from the\r\nmetropolis. Captain Wragge showed his annoyance openly at the\r\nunnecessary delay thus occasioned in the return to Aldborough, but\r\nwithout producing any effect. Noel Vanstone shook his obstinate little\r\nhead, and solemnly refused to trifle with his responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe first event which occurred on Saturday morning was the arrival of\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s letter to her master, inclosed in one of the envelopes\r\nwhich the captain had addressed to himself. He received it (by previous\r\narrangement with the waiter) in his bedroom\xe2\x80\x94read it with the closest\r\nattention\xe2\x80\x94and put it away carefully in his pocketbook. The letter was\r\nominous of serious events to come when the housekeeper returned to\r\nEngland; and it was due to Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94who was the person threatened\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nplace the warning of danger in her own possession.\r\n\r\nLater in the day the fourth candidate appeared for the maid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsituation\xe2\x80\x94a young woman of small expectations and subdued manners, who\r\nlooked (as the landlady remarked) like a person overtaken by\r\nmisfortune. She passed the ordeal of examination successfully, and\r\naccepted the wages offered without a murmur. The engagement having been\r\nratified on both sides, fresh delays ensued, of which Noel Vanstone was\r\nonce more the cause. He had not yet made up his mind whether he would,\r\nor would not, give more than a guinea for the wedding-ring; and he\r\nwasted the rest of the day to such disastrous purpose in one jeweler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop after another, that he and the captain, and the new lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid\r\n(who traveled with them), were barely in time to catch the last train\r\nfrom London that evening. It was late at night when they left the\r\nrailway at the nearest station to Aldborough. Captain Wragge had been\r\nstrangely silent all through the journey. His mind was ill at ease. He\r\nhad left Magdalen, under very critical circumstances, with no fit\r\nperson to control her, and he was wholly ignorant of the progress of\r\nevents in his absence at North Shingles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened at Aldborough in Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s absence? Events had\r\noccurred which the captain\xe2\x80\x99s utmost dexterity might have found it hard\r\nto remedy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the chaise had left North Shingles, Mrs. Wragge received the\r\nmessage which her husband had charged the servant to deliver. She\r\nhastened into the parlor, bewildered by her stormy interview with the\r\ncaptain, and penitently conscious that she had done wrong, without\r\nknowing what the wrong was. If Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s mind had been unoccupied by\r\nthe one idea of the marriage which now filled it\xe2\x80\x94if she had possessed\r\ncomposure enough to listen to Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s rambling narrative of what\r\nhad happened during her interview with the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisit to the wardrobe must, sooner or later, have formed part of the\r\ndisclosure; and Magdalen, although she might never have guessed the\r\ntruth, must at least have been warned that there was some element of\r\ndanger lurking treacherously in the Alpaca dress. As it was, no such\r\nconsequence as this followed Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in the parlor;\r\nfor no such consequence was now possible.\r\n\r\nEvents which had happened earlier in the morning, events which had\r\nhappened for days and weeks past, had vanished as completely from\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s mind as if they had never taken place. The horror of the\r\ncoming Monday\xe2\x80\x94the merciless certainty implied in the appointment of the\r\nday and hour\xe2\x80\x94petrified all feeling in her, and annihilated all thought.\r\nMrs. Wragge made three separate attempts to enter on the subject of the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s visit. The first time she might as well have addressed\r\nherself to the wind, or to the sea. The second attempt seemed likely to\r\nbe more successful. Magdalen sighed, listened for a moment\r\nindifferently, and then dismissed the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe end has come all the same. I\xe2\x80\x99m not angry with you. Say no\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d Later in the day, from not knowing what else to talk about, Mrs.\r\nWragge tried again. This time Magdalen turned on her impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry me about trifles! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Wragge\r\nclosed her lips on the spot, and returned to the subject no more.\r\nMagdalen, who had been kind to her at all other times, had angrily\r\nforbidden it. The captain\xe2\x80\x94utterly ignorant of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s interest\r\nin the secrets of the wardrobe\xe2\x80\x94had never so much as approached it. All\r\nthe information that he had extracted from his wife\xe2\x80\x99s mental confusion,\r\nhe had extracted by putting direct questions, derived purely from the\r\nresources of his own knowledge. He had insisted on plain answers,\r\nwithout excuses of any kind; he had carried his point as usual; and his\r\ndeparture the same morning had left him no chance of re-opening the\r\nquestion, even if his irritation against his wife had permitted him to\r\ndo so. There the Alpaca dress hung, neglected in the dark\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nunnoticed, unsuspected center of dangers that were still to come.\r\n\r\nToward the afternoon Mrs. Wragge took courage to start a suggestion of\r\nher own\xe2\x80\x94she pleaded for a little turn in the fresh air.\r\n\r\nMagdalen passively put on her hat; passively accompanied her companion\r\nalong the public walk, until they reached its northward extremity. Here\r\nthe beach was left solitary, and here they sat down, side by side, on\r\nthe shingle. It was a bright, exhilarating day; pleasure-boats were\r\nsailing on the calm blue water; Aldborough was idling happily afloat\r\nand ashore. Mrs. Wragge recovered her spirits in the gayety of the\r\nprospect\xe2\x80\x94she amused herself like a child, by tossing pebbles into the\r\nsea. From time to time she stole a questioning glance at Magdalen, and\r\nsaw no encouragement in her manner, no change to cordiality in her\r\nface. She sat silent on the slope of the shingle, with her elbow on her\r\nknee, and her head resting on her hand, looking out over the\r\nsea\xe2\x80\x94looking with rapt attention, and yet with eyes that seemed to\r\nnotice nothing. Mrs. Wragge wearied of the pebbles, and lost her\r\ninterest in looking at the pleasure-boats. Her great head began to nod\r\nheavily, and she dozed in the warm, drowsy air. When she woke, the\r\npleasure-boats were far off; their sails were white specks in the\r\ndistance. The idlers on the beach were thinned in number; the sun was\r\nlow in the heaven; the blue sea was darker, and rippled by a breeze.\r\nChanges on sky and earth and ocean told of the waning day; change was\r\neverywhere\xe2\x80\x94except close at her side. There Magdalen sat, in the same\r\nposition, with weary eyes that still looked over the sea, and still saw\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do speak to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge.\r\n\r\nMagdalen started, and looked about her vacantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s late,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shivering under the first sensation that reached\r\nher of the rising breeze. \xe2\x80\x9cCome home; you want your tea.\xe2\x80\x9d They walked\r\nhome in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me for asking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, as they sat\r\ntogether at the tea-table. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you troubled, my dear, in your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t notice me. My trouble will soon be\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited patiently until Mrs. Wragge had made an end of the meal, and\r\nthen went upstairs to her own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonday!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she sat down at her toilet-table. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething may\r\nhappen before Monday comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer fingers wandered mechanically among the brushes and combs, the tiny\r\nbottles and cases placed on the table. She set them in order, now in\r\none way, and now in another\xe2\x80\x94then on a sudden pushed them away from her\r\nin a heap. For a minute or two her hands remained idle. That interval\r\npassed, they grew restless again, and pulled the two little drawers\r\nbackward and forward in their grooves. Among the objects laid in one of\r\nthem was a Prayer-book which had belonged to her at Combe-Raven, and\r\nwhich she had saved with her other relics of the past, when she and her\r\nsister had taken their farewell of home. She opened the Prayer-book,\r\nafter a long hesitation, at the Marriage Service, shut it again before\r\nshe had read a line, and put it back hurriedly in one of the drawers.\r\nAfter turning the key in the locks, she rose and walked to the window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe horrible sea!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning from it with a shudder of\r\ndisgust\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe lonely, dreary, horrible sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went back to the drawer, and took the Prayer-book out for the\r\nsecond time, half opened it again at the Marriage Service, and\r\nimpatiently threw it back into the drawer. This time, after turning the\r\nlock, she took the key away, walked with it in her hand to the open\r\nwindow, and threw it violently from her into the garden. It fell on a\r\nbed thickly planted with flowers. It was invisible; it was lost. The\r\nsense of its loss seemed to relieve her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething may happen on Friday; something may happen on Saturday;\r\nsomething may happen on Sunday. Three days still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed the green shutters outside the window and drew the curtains\r\nto darken the room still more. Her head felt heavy; her eyes were\r\nburning hot. She threw herself on her bed, with a sullen impulse to\r\nsleep away the time. The quiet of the house helped her; the darkness of\r\nthe room helped her; the stupor of mind into which she had fallen had\r\nits effect on her senses; she dropped into a broken sleep. Her restless\r\nhands moved incessantly, her head tossed from side to side of the\r\npillow, but still she slept. Ere long words fell by ones and twos from\r\nher lips; words whispered in her sleep, growing more and more\r\ncontinuous, more and more articulate, the longer the sleep lasted\xe2\x80\x94words\r\nwhich seemed to calm her restlessness and to hush her into deeper\r\nrepose. She smiled; she was in the happy land of dreams; Frank\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nescaped her. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you love me, Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling,\r\nsay it again! say it again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time passed, the room grew darker; and still she slumbered and\r\ndreamed. Toward sunset\xe2\x80\x94without any noise inside the house or out to\r\naccount for it\xe2\x80\x94she started up on the bed, awake again in an instant.\r\nThe drowsy obscurity of the room struck her with terror. She ran to the\r\nwindow, pushed open the shutters, and leaned far out into the evening\r\nair and the evening light. Her eyes devoured the trivial sights on the\r\nbeach; her ears drank in the welcome murmur of the sea. Anything to\r\ndeliver her from the waking impression which her dreams had left! No\r\nmore darkness, no more repose. Sleep that came mercifully to others\r\ncame treacherously to her. Sleep had only closed her eyes on the\r\nfuture, to open them on the past.\r\n\r\nShe went down again into the parlor, eager to talk\xe2\x80\x94no matter how idly,\r\nno matter on what trifles. The room was empty. Perhaps Mrs. Wragge had\r\ngone to her work\xe2\x80\x94perhaps she was too tired to talk. Magdalen took her\r\nhat from the table and went out. The sea that she had shrunk from, a\r\nfew hours since, looked friendly now. How lovely it was in its cool\r\nevening blue! What a god-like joy in the happy multitude of waves\r\nleaping up to the light of heaven!\r\n\r\nShe stayed out until the night fell and the stars appeared. The night\r\nsteadied her.\r\n\r\nBy slow degrees her mind recovered its balance and she looked her\r\nposition unflinchingly in the face. The vain hope that accident might\r\ndefeat the very end for which, of her own free-will, she had\r\nceaselessly plotted and toiled, vanished and left her; self-dissipated\r\nin its own weakness. She knew the true alternative, and faced it. On\r\none side was the revolting ordeal of the marriage; on the other, the\r\nabandonment of her purpose. Was it too late to choose between the\r\nsacrifice of the purpose and the sacrifice of herself? Yes! too late.\r\nThe backward path had closed behind her. Time that no wish could\r\nchange, Time that no prayers could recall, had made her purpose a part\r\nof herself: once she had governed it; now it governed her. The more she\r\nshrank, the harder she struggled, the more mercilessly it drove her on.\r\nNo other feeling in her was strong enough to master it\xe2\x80\x94not even the\r\nhorror that was maddening her\xe2\x80\x94the horror of her marriage.\r\n\r\nToward nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock she went back to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalking again!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, meeting her at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in\r\nand sit down, my dear. How tired you must be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen smiled, and patted Mrs. Wragge kindly on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget how strong I am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing hurts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lit her candle and went upstairs again into her room. As she\r\nreturned to the old place by her toilet-table, the vain hope in the\r\nthree days of delay, the vain hope of deliverance by accident, came\r\nback to her\xe2\x80\x94this time in a form more tangible than the form which it\r\nhad hitherto worn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriday, Saturday, Sunday. Something may happen to him; something may\r\nhappen to me. Something serious; something fatal. One of us may die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden change came over her face. She shivered, though there was no\r\ncold in the air. She started, though there was no noise to alarm her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of us may die. I may be the one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fell into deep thought, roused herself after a while, and, opening\r\nthe door, called to Mrs. Wragge to come and speak to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were right in thinking I should fatigue myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nwalk has been a little too much for me. I feel tired, and I am going to\r\nbed. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d She kissed Mrs. Wragge and softly closed the door\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAfter a few turns backward and forward in the room, she abruptly opened\r\nher writing-case and began a letter to her sister. The letter grew and\r\ngrew under her hands; she filled sheet after sheet of note-paper. Her\r\nheart was full of her subject: it was her own story addressed to Norah.\r\nShe shed no tears; she was composed to a quiet sadness. Her pen ran\r\nsmoothly on. After writing for more than two hours, she left off while\r\nthe letter was still unfinished. There was no signature attached to\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94there was a blank space reserved, to be filled up at some other\r\ntime. After putting away the case, with the sheets of writing secured\r\ninside it, she walked to the window for air, and stood there looking\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe moon was waning over the sea. The breeze of the earlier hours had\r\ndied out. On earth and ocean, the spirit of the Night brooded in a deep\r\nand awful calm.\r\n\r\nHer head drooped low on her bosom, and all the view waned before her\r\neyes with the waning moon. She saw no sea, no sky. Death, the Tempter,\r\nwas busy at her heart. Death, the Tempter, pointed homeward, to the\r\ngrave of her dead parents in Combe-Raven churchyard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNineteen last birthday,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly nineteen!\xe2\x80\x9d She moved away\r\nfrom the window, hesitated, and then looked out again at the view. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nbeautiful night!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, the beautiful night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left the window and lay down on her bed. Sleep, that had come\r\ntreacherously before, came mercifully now; came deep and dreamless, the\r\nimage of her last waking thought\xe2\x80\x94the image of Death.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Mrs. Wragge went into Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s room, and found\r\nthat she had risen betimes. She was sitting before the glass, drawing\r\nthe comb slowly through and through her hair\xe2\x80\x94thoughtful and quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel this morning, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite well\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter replying in the affirmative, she stopped, considered for a\r\nmoment, and suddenly contradicted herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot quite well. I am suffering a little from\r\ntoothache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she altered her first answer in those words she gave a twist to her\r\nhair with the comb, so that it fell forward and hid her face.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast she was very silent, and she took nothing but a cup of\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go to the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s and get something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo let me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe refused for the second time, sharply and angrily. As usual, Mrs.\r\nWragge submitted, and let her have her own way. When breakfast was\r\nover, she rose, without a word of explanation, and went out. Mrs.\r\nWragge watched her from the window and saw that she took the direction\r\nof the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s door she stopped\xe2\x80\x94paused before entering the\r\nshop, and looked in at the window\xe2\x80\x94hesitated, and walked away a\r\nlittle\xe2\x80\x94hesitated again, and took the first turning which led back to\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\nWithout looking about her, without caring what place she chose, she\r\nseated herself on the shingle. The only persons who were near to her,\r\nin the position she now occupied, were a nursemaid and two little boys.\r\nThe youngest of the two had a tiny toy-ship in his hand. After looking\r\nat Magdalen for a little while with the quaintest gravity and\r\nattention, the boy suddenly approached her, and opened the way to an\r\nacquaintance by putting his toy composedly on her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at my ship,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, crossing his hands on Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknee.\r\n\r\nShe was not usually patient with children. In happier days she would\r\nnot have met the boy\xe2\x80\x99s advance toward her as she met it now. The hard\r\ndespair in her eyes left them suddenly; her fast-closed lips parted and\r\ntrembled. She put the ship back into the child\xe2\x80\x99s hands and lifted him\r\non her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give me a kiss?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. The boy looked at his\r\nship as if he would rather have kissed the ship.\r\n\r\nShe repeated the question\xe2\x80\x94repeated it almost humbly. The child put his\r\nhand up to her neck and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was your sister, would you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d All the misery of her\r\nfriendless position, all the wasted tenderness of her heart, poured\r\nfrom her in those words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, hiding her face on the bosom of the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s frock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at my ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at the ship through her gathering tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, trying hard to find her way even to\r\nthe interest of a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call it Uncle Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s ship,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Kirke has gone\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe name recalled nothing to her memory. No remembrances but old\r\nremembrances lived in her now. \xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated absently, thinking\r\nwhat she should say to her little friend next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cGone to China.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven from the lips of a child that word struck her to the heart. She\r\nput Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s little nephew off her lap, and instantly left the beach.\r\n\r\nAs she turned back to the house, the struggle of the past night renewed\r\nitself in her mind. But the sense of relief which the child had brought\r\nto her, the reviving tenderness which she had felt while he sat on her\r\nknee, influenced her still. She was conscious of a dawning hope,\r\nopening freshly on her thoughts, as the boy\xe2\x80\x99s innocent eyes had opened\r\non her face when he came to her on the beach. Was it too late to turn\r\nback? Once more she asked herself that question, and now, for the first\r\ntime, she asked it in doubt.\r\n\r\nShe ran up to her own room with a lurking distrust in her changed self\r\nwhich warned her to act, and not to think. Without waiting to remove\r\nher shawl or to take off her hat, she opened her writing-case and\r\naddressed these lines to Captain Wragge as fast as her pen could trace\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find the money I promised you inclosed in this. My resolution\r\nhas failed me. The horror of marrying him is more than I can face. I\r\nhave left Aldborough. Pity my weakness, and forget me. Let us never\r\nmeet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith throbbing heart, with eager, trembling fingers, she drew her\r\nlittle white silk bag from her bosom and took out the banknotes to\r\ninclose them in the letter. Her hand searched impetuously; her hand had\r\nlost its discrimination of touch. She grasped the whole contents of the\r\nbag in one handful of papers, and drew them out violently, tearing some\r\nand disarranging the folds of others. As she threw them down before her\r\non the table, the first object that met her eye was her own\r\nhandwriting, faded already with time. She looked closer, and saw the\r\nwords she had copied from her dead father\xe2\x80\x99s letter\xe2\x80\x94saw the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrief and terrible commentary on them confronting her at the bottom of\r\nthe page:\r\n\r\n_Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s daughters are Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s Children, and the law leaves\r\nthem helpless at their uncle\xe2\x80\x99s mercy._\r\n\r\nHer throbbing heart stopped; her trembling hands grew icily quiet. All\r\nthe Past rose before her in mute, overwhelming reproach. She took up\r\nthe lines which her own hand had written hardly a minute since, and\r\nlooked at the ink, still wet on the letters, with a vacant incredulity.\r\n\r\nThe color that had risen on her cheeks faded from them once more. The\r\nhard despair looked out again, cold and glittering, in her tearless\r\neyes. She folded the banknotes carefully, and put them back in her bag.\r\nShe pressed the copy of her father\xe2\x80\x99s letter to her lips, and returned\r\nit to its place with the banknotes. When the bag was in her bosom\r\nagain, she waited a little, with her face hidden in her hands, then\r\ndeliberately tore up the lines addressed to Captain Wragge. Before the\r\nink was dry, the letter lay in fragments on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as the last morsel of the torn paper dropped from her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the way I go there is no turning back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose composedly and left the room. While descending the stairs, she\r\nmet Mrs. Wragge coming up. \xe2\x80\x9cGoing out again, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs.\r\nWragge. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I go with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s attention wandered. Instead of answering the question, she\r\nabsently answered her own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThousands of women marry for money,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe helpless perplexity of Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s face as she spoke those words\r\nroused her to a sense of present things. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\npuzzle you, don\xe2\x80\x99t I? Never mind what I say\xe2\x80\x94all girls talk nonsense, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m no better than the rest of them. Come! I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a treat. You\r\nshall enjoy yourself while the captain is away. We will have a long\r\ndrive by ourselves. Put on your smart bonnet, and come with me to the\r\nhotel. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the landlady to put a nice cold dinner into a basket.\r\nYou shall have all the things you like, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait on you. When you\r\nare an old, old woman, you will remember me kindly, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? You will\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad girl; hundreds worse than she was live and\r\nprosper, and nobody blames them.\xe2\x80\x99 There! there! go and put your bonnet\r\non. Oh, my God, what is my heart made of! How it lives and lives, when\r\nother girls\xe2\x80\x99 hearts would have died in them long ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn half an hour more she and Mrs. Wragge were seated together in the\r\ncarriage. One of the horses was restive at starting. \xe2\x80\x9cFlog him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried angrily to the driver. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you frightened about? Flog him!\r\nSuppose the carriage was upset,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning suddenly to her\r\ncompanion; \xe2\x80\x9cand suppose I was thrown out and killed on the spot?\r\nNonsense! don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me in that way. I\xe2\x80\x99m like your husband; I have a\r\ndash of humor, and I\xe2\x80\x99m only joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were out the whole day. When they reached home again, it was after\r\ndark. The long succession of hours passed in the fresh air left them\r\nboth with the same sense of fatigue. Again that night Magdalen slept\r\nthe deep dreamless sleep of the night before. And so the Friday closed.\r\n\r\nHer last thought at night had been the thought which had sustained her\r\nthroughout the day. She had laid her head on the pillow with the same\r\nreckless resolution to submit to the coming trial which had already\r\nexpressed itself in words when she and Mrs. Wragge met by accident on\r\nthe stairs. When she woke on the morning of Saturday, the resolution\r\nwas gone. The Friday\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\xe2\x80\x94the Friday\xe2\x80\x99s events even\xe2\x80\x94were blotted\r\nout of her mind. Once again, creeping chill through the flow of her\r\nyoung blood, she felt the slow and deadly prompting of despair which\r\nhad come to her in the waning moonlight, which had whispered to her in\r\nthe awful calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the end as the end must be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9con Thursday\r\nnight. I have been wrong ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she and her companion met that morning, she reiterated her\r\ncomplaint of suffering from the toothache; she repeated her refusal to\r\nallow Mrs. Wragge to procure a remedy; she left the house after\r\nbreakfast, in the direction of the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop, exactly as she had\r\nleft it on the morning before.\r\n\r\nThis time she entered the shop without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got an attack of toothache,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, abruptly, to an elderly\r\nman who stood behind the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I look at the tooth, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity to look. It is a hollow tooth. I think I have\r\ncaught cold in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chemist recommended various remedies which were in vogue fifteen\r\nyears since. She declined purchasing any of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always found Laudanum relieve the pain better than anything\r\nelse,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, trifling with the bottles on the counter, and looking\r\nat them while she spoke, instead of looking at the chemist. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\nhave some Laudanum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, miss. Excuse my asking the question\xe2\x80\x94it is only a matter of\r\nform. You are staying at Aldborough, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am Miss Bygrave, of North Shingles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chemist bowed; and, turning to his shelves, filled an ordinary\r\nhalf-ounce bottle with laudanum immediately. In ascertaining his\r\ncustomer\xe2\x80\x99s name and address beforehand, the owner of the shop had taken\r\na precaution which was natural to a careful man, but which was by no\r\nmeans universal, under similar circumstances, in the state of the law\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I put you up a little cotton wool with the laudanum?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nafter he had placed a label on the bottle, and had written a word on it\r\nin large letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please. What have you just written on the bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d She put the\r\nquestion sharply, with something of distrust as well as curiosity in\r\nher manner.\r\n\r\nThe chemist answered the question by turning the label toward her. She\r\nsaw written on it, in large letters\xe2\x80\x94POISON.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to be on the safe side, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nworthy people in other respects are often sadly careless where poisons\r\nare concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began trifling again with the bottles on the counter, and put\r\nanother question, with an ill-concealed anxiety to hear the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there danger,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cin such a little drop of Laudanum as\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is Death in it, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the chemist, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath to a child, or to a person in delicate health?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath to the strongest man in England, let him be who he may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that answer, the chemist sealed up the bottle in its wrapping of\r\nwhite paper and handed the laudanum to Magdalen across the counter. She\r\nlaughed as she took it from him, and paid for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no fear of accidents at North Shingles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall keep the bottle locked up in my dressing-case. If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrelieve the pain, I must come to you again, and try some other remedy.\r\nGood-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went straight back to the house without once looking up, without\r\nnoticing any one who passed her. She brushed by Mrs. Wragge in the\r\npassage as she might have brushed by a piece of furniture. She ascended\r\nthe stairs, and caught her foot twice in her dress, from sheer\r\ninattention to the common precaution of holding it up. The trivial\r\ndaily interests of life had lost their hold on her already.\r\n\r\nIn the privacy of her own room, she took the bottle from its wrapping,\r\nand threw the paper and the cotton wool into the fire-place. At the\r\nmoment when she did this there was a knock at the door. She hid the\r\nlittle bottle, and looked up impatiently. Mrs. Wragge came into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got something for your toothache, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I do anything to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge still lingered uneasily near the door. Her manner showed\r\nplainly that she had something more to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not settled in my mind about\r\nthe captain. He\xe2\x80\x99s a great writer, and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t written. He\xe2\x80\x99s as quick\r\nas lightning, and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come back. Here\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday, and no signs of\r\nhim. Has he run away, do you think? Has anything happened to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not. Go downstairs; I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and speak to you about it\r\ndirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was alone again, Magdalen rose from her chair, advanced\r\ntoward a cupboard in the room which locked, and paused for a moment,\r\nwith her hand on the key, in doubt. Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s appearance had\r\ndisturbed the whole current of her thoughts. Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nquestion, trifling as it was, had checked her on the verge of the\r\nprecipice\xe2\x80\x94had roused the old vain hope in her once more of release by\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy may something not have happened to one of\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe placed the laudanum in the cupboard, locked it, and put the key in\r\nher pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cTime enough still,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore Monday. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait\r\ntill the captain comes back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some consultation downstairs, it was agreed that the servant\r\nshould sit up that night, in expectation of her master\xe2\x80\x99s return. The\r\nday passed quietly, without events of any kind. Magdalen dreamed away\r\nthe hours over a book. A weary patience of expectation was all she felt\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94the poignant torment of thought was dulled and blunted at last. She\r\npassed the day and the evening in the parlor, vaguely conscious of a\r\nstrange feeling of aversion to going back to her own room. As the night\r\nadvanced, as the noises ceased indoors and out, her restlessness began\r\nto return. She endeavored to quiet herself by reading. Books failed to\r\nfix her attention. The newspaper was lying in a corner of the room: she\r\ntried the newspaper next.\r\n\r\nShe looked mechanically at the headings of the articles; she listlessly\r\nturned over page after page, until her wandering attention was arrested\r\nby the narrative of an Execution in a distant part of England. There\r\nwas nothing to strike her in the story of the crime, and yet she read\r\nit. It was a common, horribly common, act of bloodshed\xe2\x80\x94the murder of a\r\nwoman in farm-service by a man in the same employment who was jealous\r\nof her. He had been convicted on no extraordinary evidence, he had been\r\nhanged under no unusual circumstances. He had made his confession, when\r\nhe knew there was no hope for him, like other criminals of his class,\r\nand the newspaper had printed it at the end of the article, in these\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kept company with the deceased for a year or thereabouts. I said I\r\nwould marry her when I had money enough. She said I had money enough\r\nnow. We had a quarrel. She refused to walk out with me any more; she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t draw me my beer; she took up with my fellow-servant, David\r\nCrouch. I went to her on the Saturday, and said I would marry her as\r\nsoon as we could be asked in church if she would give up Crouch. She\r\nlaughed at me. She turned me out of the wash-house, and the rest of\r\nthem saw her turn me out. I was not easy in my mind. I went and sat on\r\nthe gate\xe2\x80\x94the gate in the meadow they call Pettit\xe2\x80\x99s Piece. I thought I\r\nwould shoot her. I went and fetched my gun and loaded it. I went out\r\ninto Pettit\xe2\x80\x99s Piece again. I was hard put to it to make up my mind. I\r\nthought I would try my luck\xe2\x80\x94I mean try whether to kill her or not\xe2\x80\x94-by\r\nthrowing up the Spud of the plow into the air. I said to myself, if it\r\nfalls flat, I\xe2\x80\x99ll spare her; if it falls point in the earth, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill\r\nher. I took a good swing with it, and shied it up. It fell point in the\r\nearth. I went and shot her. It was a bad job, but I did it. I did it,\r\nas they said I did it at the trial. I hope the Lord will have mercy on\r\nme. I wish my mother to have my old clothes. I have no more to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the happier days of her life, Magdalen would have passed over the\r\nnarrative of the execution, and the printed confession which\r\naccompanied it unread; the subject would have failed to attract her.\r\nShe read the horrible story now\xe2\x80\x94read it with an interest unintelligible\r\nto herself. Her attention, which had wandered over higher and better\r\nthings, followed every sentence of the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s hideously direct\r\nconfession from beginning to end. If the man or the woman had been\r\nknown to her, if the place had been familiar to her memory, she could\r\nhardly have followed the narrative more closely, or have felt a more\r\ndistinct impression of it left on her mind. She laid down the paper,\r\nwondering at herself; she took it up once more, and tried to read some\r\nother portion of the contents. The effort was useless; her attention\r\nwandered again. She threw the paper away, and went out into the garden.\r\nThe night was dark; the stars were few and faint. She could just see\r\nthe gravel-walk\xe2\x80\x94she could just pace backward and forward between the\r\nhouse door and the gate.\r\n\r\nThe confession in the newspaper had taken a fearful hold on her mind.\r\nAs she paced the walk, the black night opened over the sea, and showed\r\nher the murderer in the field hurling the Spud of the plow into the\r\nair. She ran, shuddering, back to the house. The murderer followed her\r\ninto the parlor. She seized the candle and went up into her room. The\r\nvision of her own distempered fancy followed her to the place where the\r\nlaudanum was hidden, and vanished there.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight, and there was no sign yet of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nShe took from the writing-case the long letter which she had written to\r\nNorah, and slowly read it through. The letter quieted her. When she\r\nreached the blank space left at the end, she hurriedly turned back and\r\nbegan it over again.\r\n\r\nOne o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck from the church clock, and still the captain never\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nShe read the letter for the second time; she turned back obstinately,\r\ndespairingly, and began it for the third time. As she once more reached\r\nthe last page, she looked at her watch. It was a quarter to two. She\r\nhad just put the watch back in the belt of her dress, when there came\r\nto her\xe2\x80\x94far off in the stillness of the morning\xe2\x80\x94a sound of wheels.\r\n\r\nShe dropped the letter and clasped her cold hands in her lap and\r\nlistened. The sound came on, faster and faster, nearer and nearer\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ntrivial sound to all other ears; the sound of Doom to hers. It passed\r\nthe side of the house; it traveled a little further on; it stopped. She\r\nheard a loud knocking\xe2\x80\x94then the opening of a window\xe2\x80\x94then voices\xe2\x80\x94then a\r\nlong silence\xe2\x80\x94than the wheels again coming back\xe2\x80\x94then the opening of the\r\ndoor below, and the sound of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s voice in the passage.\r\n\r\nShe could endure it no longer. She opened her door a little way and\r\ncalled to him.\r\n\r\nHe ran upstairs instantly, astonished that she was not in bed. She\r\nspoke to him through the narrow opening of the door, keeping herself\r\nhidden behind it, for she was afraid to let him see her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anything gone wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake your mind easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing has gone wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs no accident likely to happen between this and Monday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever. The marriage is a certainty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA certainty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her hand out through the door. He took it with some little\r\nsurprise; it was not often in his experience that she gave him her hand\r\nof her own accord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have sat up too long,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he felt the clasp of her cold\r\nfingers. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you will have a bad night\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you will not\r\nsleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe softly closed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9csounder than you think for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was past two o\xe2\x80\x99clock when she shut herself up alone in her room. Her\r\nchair stood in its customary place by the toilet-table. She sat down\r\nfor a few minutes thoughtfully, then opened her letter to Norah, and\r\nturned to the end where the blank space was left. The last lines\r\nwritten above the space ran thus: \xe2\x80\x9c... I have laid my whole heart bare\r\nto you; I have hidden nothing. It has come to this. The end I have\r\ntoiled for, at such terrible cost to myself, is an end which I must\r\nreach or die. It is wickedness, madness, what you will\xe2\x80\x94but it is so.\r\nThere are now two journeys before me to choose between. If I can marry\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94the journey to the church. If the profanation of myself is more\r\nthan I can bear\xe2\x80\x94the journey to the grave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder that last sentence, she wrote these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy choice is made. If the cruel law will let you, lay me with my\r\nfather and mother in the churchyard at home. Farewell, my love! Be\r\nalways innocent; be always happy. If Frank ever asks about me, say I\r\ndied forgiving him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t grieve long for me, Norah\xe2\x80\x94I am not worth it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sealed the letter, and addressed it to her sister. The tears\r\ngathered in her eyes as she laid it on the table. She waited until her\r\nsight was clear again, and then took the banknotes once more from the\r\nlittle bag in her bosom. After wrapping them in a sheet of note paper,\r\nshe wrote Captain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s name on the inclosure, and added these words\r\nbelow it: \xe2\x80\x9cLock the door of my room, and leave me till my sister comes.\r\nThe money I promised you is in this. You are not to blame; it is my\r\nfault, and mine only. If you have any friendly remembrance of me, be\r\nkind to your wife for my sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter placing the inclosure by the letter to Norah, she rose and looked\r\nround the room. Some few little things in it were not in their places.\r\nShe set them in order, and drew the curtains on either side at the head\r\nof her bed. Her own dress was the next object of her scrutiny. It was\r\nall as neat, as pure, as prettily arranged as ever. Nothing about her\r\nwas disordered but her hair. Some tresses had fallen loose on one side\r\nof her head; she carefully put them back in their places with the help\r\nof her glass. \xe2\x80\x9cHow pale I look!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, with a faint smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I be paler still when they find me in the morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went straight to the place where the laudanum was hidden, and took\r\nit out. The bottle was so small that it lay easily in the palm of her\r\nhand. She let it remain there for a little while, and stood looking at\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEATH!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this drop of brown drink\xe2\x80\x94DEATH!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the words passed her lips, an agony of unutterable horror seized on\r\nher in an instant. She crossed the room unsteadily, with a maddening\r\nconfusion in her head, with a suffocating anguish at her heart. She\r\ncaught at the table to support herself. The faint clink of the bottle,\r\nas it fell harmlessly from her loosened grasp and rolled against some\r\nporcelain object on the table, struck through her brain like the stroke\r\nof a knife. The sound of her own voice, sunk to a whisper\xe2\x80\x94her voice\r\nonly uttering that one word, Death\xe2\x80\x94rushed in her ears like the rushing\r\nof a wind. She dragged herself to the bedside, and rested her head\r\nagainst it, sitting on the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my life! my life!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat is my life worth, that I cling to it like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn interval passed, and she felt her strength returning. She raised\r\nherself on her knees and hid her face on the bed. She tried to pray\xe2\x80\x94to\r\npray to be forgiven for seeking the refuge of death. Frantic words\r\nburst from her lips\xe2\x80\x94words which would have risen to cries, if she had\r\nnot stifled them in the bed-clothes. She started to her feet; despair\r\nstrengthened her with a headlong fury against herself. In one moment\r\nshe was back at the table; in another, the poison was once more in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nShe removed the cork and lifted the bottle to her mouth.\r\n\r\nAt the first cold touch of the glass on her lips, her strong young life\r\nleaped up in her leaping blood, and fought with the whole frenzy of its\r\nloathing against the close terror of Death. Every active power in the\r\nexuberant vital force that was in her rose in revolt against the\r\ndestruction which her own will would fain have wreaked on her own life.\r\nShe paused: for the second time, she paused in spite of herself. There,\r\nin the glorious perfection of her youth and health\xe2\x80\x94there, trembling on\r\nthe verge of human existence, she stood; with the kiss of the Destroyer\r\nclose at her lips, and Nature, faithful to its sacred trust, fighting\r\nfor the salvation of her to the last.\r\n\r\nNo word passed her lips. Her cheeks flushed deep; her breath came thick\r\nand fast. With the poison still in her hand, with the sense that she\r\nmight faint in another moment, she made for the window, and threw back\r\nthe curtain that covered it.\r\n\r\nThe new day had risen. The broad gray dawn flowed in on her, over the\r\nquiet eastern sea.\r\n\r\nShe saw the waters heaving, large and silent, in the misty calm; she\r\nfelt the fresh breath of the morning flutter cool on her face. Her\r\nstrength returned; her mind cleared a little. At the sight of the sea,\r\nher memory recalled the walk in the garden overnight, and the picture\r\nwhich her distempered fancy had painted on the black void. In thought,\r\nshe saw the picture again\xe2\x80\x94the murderer hurling the Spud of the plow\r\ninto the air, and setting the life or death of the woman who had\r\ndeserted him on the hazard of the falling point. The infection of that\r\nterrible superstition seized on her mind as suddenly as the new day had\r\nburst on her view. The promise of release which she saw in it from the\r\nhorror of her own hesitation roused the last energies of her despair.\r\nShe resolved to end the struggle by setting her life or death on the\r\nhazard of a chance.\r\n\r\nOn what chance?\r\n\r\nThe sea showed it to her. Dimly distinguishable through the mist, she\r\nsaw a little fleet of coasting-vessels slowly drifting toward the\r\nhouse, all following the same direction with the favoring set of the\r\ntide. In half an hour\xe2\x80\x94perhaps in less\xe2\x80\x94the fleet would have passed her\r\nwindow. The hands of her watch pointed to four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. She seated\r\nherself close at the side of the window, with her back toward the\r\nquarter from which the vessels were drifting down on her\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\npoison placed on the window-sill and the watch on her lap. For one\r\nhalf-hour to come she determined to wait there and count the vessels as\r\nthey went by. If in that time an even number passed her, the sign given\r\nshould be a sign to live. If the uneven number prevailed, the end\r\nshould be Death.\r\n\r\nWith that final resolution, she rested her head against the window and\r\nwaited for the ships to pass.\r\n\r\nThe first came, high, dark and near in the mist, gliding silently over\r\nthe silent sea. An interval\xe2\x80\x94and the second followed, with the third\r\nclose after it. Another interval, longer and longer drawn out\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnothing passed. She looked at her watch. Twelve minutes, and three\r\nships. Three.\r\n\r\nThe fourth came, slower than the rest, larger than the rest, further\r\noff in the mist than the rest. The interval followed; a long interval\r\nonce more. Then the next vessel passed, darkest and nearest of all.\r\nFive. The next uneven number\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFive.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch again. Nineteen minutes, and five ships. Twenty\r\nminutes. Twenty-one, two, three\xe2\x80\x94and no sixth vessel. Twenty-four, and\r\nthe sixth came by. Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight,\r\nand the next uneven number\xe2\x80\x94the fatal Seven\xe2\x80\x94glided into view. Two\r\nminutes to the end of the half-hour. And seven ships.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine, and nothing followed in the wake of the seventh ship. The\r\nminute-hand of the watch moved on half-way to thirty, and still the\r\nwhite heaving sea was a misty blank. Without moving her head from the\r\nwindow, she took the poison in one hand, and raised the watch in the\r\nother. As the quick seconds counted each other out, her eyes, as quick\r\nas they, looked from the watch to the sea, from the sea to the\r\nwatch\xe2\x80\x94looked for the last time at the sea\xe2\x80\x94and saw the EIGHTH ship.\r\n\r\nShe never moved, she never spoke. The death of thought, the death of\r\nfeeling, seemed to have come to her already. She put back the poison\r\nmechanically on the ledge of the window and watched, as in a dream, the\r\nship gliding smoothly on its silent way\xe2\x80\x94gliding till it melted dimly\r\ninto shadow\xe2\x80\x94gliding till it was lost in the mist.\r\n\r\nThe strain on her mind relaxed when the Messenger of Life had passed\r\nfrom her sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvidence?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered faintly to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cOr chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes closed, and her head fell back. When the sense of life\r\nreturned to her, the morning sun was warm on her face\xe2\x80\x94the blue heaven\r\nlooked down on her\xe2\x80\x94and the sea was a sea of gold.\r\n\r\nShe fell on her knees at the window and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards noon that day, the captain, waiting below stairs, and hearing\r\nno movement in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s room, felt uneasy at the long silence. He\r\ndesired the new maid to follow him upstairs, and, pointing to the door,\r\ntold her to go in softly and see whether her mistress was awake.\r\n\r\nThe maid entered the room, remained there a moment, and came out again,\r\nclosing the door gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looks beautiful, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cand she\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping as\r\nquietly as a new-born child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nThe morning of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s return to North Shingles was a morning\r\nmemorable forever in the domestic calendar of Mrs. Wragge. She dated\r\nfrom that occasion the first announcement which reached her of\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\r\n\r\nIt had been Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s earthly lot to pass her life in a state of\r\nperpetual surprise. Never yet, however, had she wandered in such a maze\r\nof astonishment as the maze in which she lost herself when the captain\r\ncoolly told her the truth. She had been sharp enough to suspect Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone of coming to the house in the character of a sweetheart\r\non approval; and she had dimly interpreted certain expressions of\r\nimpatience which had fallen from Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s lips as boding ill for the\r\nsuccess of his suit, but her utmost penetration had never reached as\r\nfar as a suspicion of the impending marriage. She rose from one climax\r\nof amazement to another, as her husband proceeded with his disclosure.\r\nA wedding in the family at a day\xe2\x80\x99s notice! and that wedding Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\nand not a single new dress ordered for anybody, the bride included! and\r\nthe Oriental Cashmere Robe totally unavailable on the occasion when she\r\nmight have worn it to the greatest advantage! Mrs. Wragge dropped\r\ncrookedly into a chair, and beat her disorderly hands on her\r\nunsymmetrical knees, in utter forgetfulness of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s presence\r\nand the captain\xe2\x80\x99s terrible eye. It would not have surprised her to hear\r\nthat the world had come to an end, and that the only mortal whom\r\nDestiny had overlooked, in winding up the affairs of this earthly\r\nplanet, was herself!\r\n\r\nLeaving his wife to recover her composure by her own unaided efforts,\r\nCaptain Wragge withdrew to wait for Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in the lower\r\nregions of the house. It was close on one o\xe2\x80\x99clock before the sound of\r\nfootsteps in the room above warned him that she was awake and stirring.\r\nHe called at once for the maid (whose name he had ascertained to be\r\nLouisa), and sent her upstairs to her mistress for the second time.\r\n\r\nMagdalen was standing by her dressing-table when a faint tap at the\r\ndoor suddenly roused her. The tap was followed by the sound of a meek\r\nvoice, which announced itself as the voice of \xe2\x80\x9cher maid,\xe2\x80\x9d and inquired\r\nif Miss Bygrave needed any assistance that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, as soon as she had recovered the\r\nsurprise of finding herself unexpectedly provided with an attendant. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill ring when I want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter dismissing the woman with that answer, she accidentally looked\r\nfrom the door to the window. Any speculations on the subject of the new\r\nservant in which she might otherwise have engaged were instantly\r\nsuspended by the sight of the bottle of laudanum, still standing on the\r\nledge of the window, where she had left it at sunrise. She took it once\r\nmore in her hand, with a strange confusion of feeling\xe2\x80\x94with a vague\r\ndoubt even yet, whether the sight of it reminded her of a terrible\r\nreality or a terrible dream. Her first impulse was to rid herself of it\r\non the spot. She raised the bottle to throw the contents out of the\r\nwindow, and paused, in sudden distrust of the impulse that had come to\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cI have accepted my new life,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know what\r\nthat life may have in store for me?\xe2\x80\x9d She turned from the window and\r\nwent back to the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI may be forced to drink it yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nand put the laudanum into her dressing-case.\r\n\r\nHer mind was not at ease when she had done this: there seemed to be\r\nsome indefinable ingratitude in the act. Still she made no attempt to\r\nremove the bottle from its hiding-place. She hurried on her toilet; she\r\nhastened the time when she could ring for the maid, and forget herself\r\nand her waking thoughts in a new subject. After touching the bell, she\r\ntook from the table her letter to Norah and her letter to the captain,\r\nput them both into her dressing-case with the laudanum, and locked it\r\nsecurely with the key which she kept attached to her watch-chain.\r\n\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s first impression of her attendant was not an agreeable one.\r\nShe could not investigate the girl with the experienced eye of the\r\nlandlady at the London hotel, who had characterized the stranger as a\r\nyoung person overtaken by misfortune, and who had showed plainly, by\r\nher look and manner, of what nature she suspected that misfortune to\r\nbe. But with this drawback, Magdalen was perfectly competent to detect\r\nthe tokens of sickness and sorrow lurking under the surface of the new\r\nmaid\xe2\x80\x99s activity and politeness. She suspected the girl was\r\nill-tempered; she disliked her name; and she was indisposed to welcome\r\nany servant who had been engaged by Noel Vanstone. But after the first\r\nfew minutes, \xe2\x80\x9cLouisa\xe2\x80\x9d grew on her liking. She answered all the\r\nquestions put to her with perfect directness; she appeared to\r\nunderstand her duties thoroughly; and she never spoke until she was\r\nspoken to first. After making all the inquiries that occurred to her at\r\nthe time, and after determining to give the maid a fair trial, Magdalen\r\nrose to leave the room. The very air in it was still heavy to her with\r\nthe oppression of the past night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything more to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning to the\r\nservant, with her hand on the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa, very respectfully and very\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think my master told me that the marriage was to be\r\nto-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen repressed the shudder that stole over her at that reference to\r\nthe marriage on the lips of a stranger, and answered in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very short time, miss, to prepare in. If you would be so kind\r\nas to give me my orders about the packing before you go downstairs\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no such preparations to make as you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen,\r\nhastily. \xe2\x80\x9cThe few things I have here can be all packed at once, if you\r\nlike. I shall wear the same dress to-morrow which I have on to-day.\r\nLeave out the straw bonnet and the light shawl, and put everything else\r\ninto my boxes. I have no new dresses to pack; I have nothing ordered\r\nfor the occasion of any sort.\xe2\x80\x9d She tried to add some commonplace\r\nphrases of explanation, accounting as probably as might be for the\r\nabsence of the usual wedding outfit and wedding-dress. But no further\r\nreference to the marriage would pass her lips, and without another word\r\nshe abruptly left the room.\r\n\r\nThe meek and melancholy Louisa stood lost in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething\r\nwrong here,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m half afraid of my new place already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe sighed resignedly, shook her head, and went to the wardrobe. She\r\nfirst examined the drawers underneath, took out the various articles of\r\nlinen laid inside, and placed them on chairs. Opening the upper part of\r\nthe wardrobe next, she ranged the dresses in it side by side on the\r\nbed. Her last proceeding was to push the empty boxes into the middle of\r\nthe room, and to compare the space at her disposal with the articles of\r\ndress which she had to pack. She completed her preliminary calculations\r\nwith the ready self-reliance of a woman who thoroughly understood her\r\nbusiness, and began the packing forthwith. Just as she had placed the\r\nfirst article of linen in the smaller box, the door of the room opened,\r\nand the house-servant, eager for gossip, came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Louisa, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear of anything like this!\xe2\x80\x9d said the house-servant,\r\nentering on her subject immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike this marriage, to be sure. You\xe2\x80\x99re London bred, they tell me. Did\r\nyou ever hear of a young lady being married without a single new thing\r\nto her back? No wedding veil, and no wedding breakfast, and no wedding\r\nfavors for the servants. It\xe2\x80\x99s flying in the face of Providence\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I say. I\xe2\x80\x99m only a poor servant, I know. But it\xe2\x80\x99s wicked, downright\r\nwicked\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who hears me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa went on with the packing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at her dresses!\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the house-servant, waving her hand\r\nindignantly at the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only a poor girl, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry the\r\nbest man alive without a new gown to my back. Look here! look at this\r\ndowdy brown thing here. Alpaca! You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to pack this Alpaca\r\nthing, are you? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly fit for a servant! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d take a gift of it if it was offered me. It would do for me if I\r\ntook it up in the skirt, and let it out in the waist\xe2\x80\x94and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook so bad with a bit of bright trimming, would it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet that dress alone, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa, as quietly as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the other, doubting whether her ears had\r\nnot deceived her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said, let that dress alone. It belongs to my mistress, and I have my\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s orders to pack up everything in the room. You are not\r\nhelping me by coming here\xe2\x80\x94you are very much in my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the house-servant, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may be London bred, as they say.\r\nBut if these are your London manners, give me Suffolk!\xe2\x80\x9d She opened the\r\ndoor with an angry snatch at the handle, shut it violently, opened it\r\nagain, and looked in. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me Suffolk!\xe2\x80\x9d said the house-servant, with a\r\nparting nod of her head to point the edge of her sarcasm.\r\n\r\nLouisa proceeded impenetrably with her packing up.\r\n\r\nHaving neatly disposed of the linen in the smaller box, she turned her\r\nattention to the dresses next. After passing them carefully in review,\r\nto ascertain which was the least valuable of the collection, and to\r\nplace that one at the bottom of the trunk for the rest to lie on, she\r\nmade her choice with very little difficulty. The first gown which she\r\nput into the box was\xe2\x80\x94the brown Alpaca dress.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Magdalen had joined the captain downstairs. Although he\r\ncould not fail to notice the languor in her face and the listlessness\r\nof all her movements, he was relieved to find that she met him with\r\nperfect composure. She was even self-possessed enough to ask him for\r\nnews of his journey, with no other signs of agitation than a passing\r\nchange of color and a little trembling of the lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much for the past,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, when his narrative of the\r\nexpedition to London by way of St. Crux had come to an end. \xe2\x80\x9cNow for\r\nthe present. The bridegroom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed, \xe2\x80\x9ccall him Mr. Noel\r\nVanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart. Mr. Noel Vanstone is coming here this afternoon to\r\ndine and spend the evening. He will be tiresome in the last degree;\r\nbut, like all tiresome people, he is not to be got rid of on any terms.\r\nBefore he comes, I have a last word or two of caution for your private\r\near. By this time to-morrow we shall have parted\xe2\x80\x94without any certain\r\nknowledge, on either side, of our ever meeting again. I am anxious to\r\nserve your interests faithfully to the last; I am anxious you should\r\nfeel that I have done all I could for your future security when we say\r\ngood-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen looked at him in surprise. He spoke in altered tones. He was\r\nagitated; he was strangely in earnest. Something in his look and manner\r\ntook her memory back to the first night at Aldborough, when she had\r\nopened her mind to him in the darkening solitude\xe2\x80\x94when they two had sat\r\ntogether alone on the slope of the martello tower. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no reason to\r\nthink otherwise than kindly of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge suddenly left his chair, and took a turn backward and\r\nforward in the room. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s last words seemed to have produced some\r\nextraordinary disturbance in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t let you say that. You have reason to\r\nthink ill of me. I have cheated you. You never got your fair share of\r\nprofit from the Entertainment, from first to last. There! now the\r\nmurder\xe2\x80\x99s out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen smiled, and signed to him to come back to his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you cheated me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were in the exercise\r\nof your profession, Captain Wragge. I expected it when I joined you. I\r\nmade no complaint at the time, and I make none now. If the money you\r\ntook is any recompense for all the trouble I have given you, you are\r\nheartily welcome to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you shake hands on that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain, with an awkwardness\r\nand hesitation strongly at variance with his customary ease of manner.\r\n\r\nMagdalen gave him her hand. He wrung it hard. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a strange girl,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, trying to speak lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have laid a hold on me that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand. I\xe2\x80\x99m half uncomfortable at taking the money from\r\nyou now; and yet you don\xe2\x80\x99t want it, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost\r\nwish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI had never met you on the Walls of York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late to wish that, Captain Wragge. Say no more. You only\r\ndistress me\xe2\x80\x94say no more. We have other subjects to talk about. What\r\nwere those words of caution which you had for my private ear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain took another turn in the room, and struggled back again\r\ninto his every-day character. He produced from his pocketbook Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s letter to her master, and handed it to Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the letter that might have ruined us if it had ever reached\r\nits address,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cRead it carefully. I have a question to ask you\r\nwhen you have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen read the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this proof,\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nMrs. Lecount relies on so confidently!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very question I was going to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsult your memory of what happened when you tried that experiment in\r\nVauxhall Walk. Did Mrs. Lecount get no other chance against you than\r\nthe chances you have told me of already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe discovered that my face was disguised, and she heard me speak in\r\nmy own voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd nothing more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Then my interpretation of the letter is clearly the right\r\none. The proof Mrs. Lecount relies on is my wife\xe2\x80\x99s infernal ghost\r\nstory\xe2\x80\x94which is, in plain English, the story of Miss Bygrave having been\r\nseen in Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s disguise; the witness being the very person who\r\nis afterward presented at Aldborough in the character of Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naunt. An excellent chance for Mrs. Lecount, if she can only lay her\r\nhand at the right time on Mrs. Wragge, and no chance at all, if she\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. Make your mind easy on that point. Mrs. Lecount and my wife have\r\nseen the last of each other. In the meantime, don\xe2\x80\x99t neglect the warning\r\nI give you, in giving you this letter. Tear it up, for fear of\r\naccidents, but don\xe2\x80\x99t forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me to remember it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen, destroying the letter\r\nwhile she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything more to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some information to give you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich may\r\nbe useful, because it relates to your future security. Mind, I want to\r\nknow nothing about your proceedings when to-morrow is over; we settled\r\nthat when we first discussed this matter. I ask no questions, and I\r\nmake no guesses. All I want to do now is to warn you of your legal\r\nposition after your marriage, and to leave you to make what use you\r\nplease of your knowledge, at your own sole discretion. I took a\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on the point when I was in London, thinking it might\r\nbe useful to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sure to be useful. What did the lawyer say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo put it plainly, this is what he said. If Mr. Noel Vanstone ever\r\ndiscovers that you have knowingly married him under a false name, he\r\ncan apply to the Ecclesiastical Court to have his marriage declared\r\nnull and void. The issue of the application would rest with the judges.\r\nBut if he could prove that he had been intentionally deceived, the\r\nlegal opinion is that his case would be a strong one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I chose to apply on my side?\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might make the application,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cBut remember\r\none thing\xe2\x80\x94you would come into Court with the acknowledgment of your own\r\ndeception. I leave you to imagine what the judges would think of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the lawyer tell you anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing besides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever the law might do\r\nwith the marriage in the lifetime of both the parties to it\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\ndeath of either one of them, no application made by the survivor would\r\navail; and, as to the case of that survivor, the marriage would remain\r\nvalid. You understand? If he dies, or if you die\xe2\x80\x94and if no application\r\nhas been made to the Court\xe2\x80\x94he the survivor, or you the survivor, would\r\nhave no power of disputing the marriage. But in the lifetime of both of\r\nyou, if he claimed to have the marriage dissolved, the chances are all\r\nin favor of his carrying his point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at Magdalen with a furtive curiosity as he said those words.\r\nShe turned her head aside, absently tying her watch-chain into a loop\r\nand untying it again, evidently thinking with the closest attention\r\nover what he had last said to her. Captain Wragge walked uneasily to\r\nthe window and looked out. The first object that caught his eye was Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone approaching from Sea View. He returned instantly to his\r\nformer place in the room, and addressed himself to Magdalen once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is Mr. Noel Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne last caution before he comes\r\nin. Be on your guard with him about your age. He put the question to me\r\nbefore he got the License. I took the shortest way out of the\r\ndifficulty, and told him you were twenty-one, and he made the\r\ndeclaration accordingly. Never mind about _me_; after to-morrow I am\r\ninvisible. But, in your own interests, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, if the subject\r\nturns up, that you were of age when you were married. There is nothing\r\nmore. You are provided with every necessary warning that I can give\r\nyou. Whatever happens in the future, remember I have done my best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the door without waiting for an answer, and went out into\r\nthe garden to receive his guest.\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone made his appearance at the gate, solemnly carrying his\r\nbridal offering to North Shingles with both hands. The object in\r\nquestion was an ancient casket (one of his father\xe2\x80\x99s bargains); inside\r\nthe casket reposed an old-fashioned carbuncle brooch, set in silver\r\n(another of his father\xe2\x80\x99s bargains)\xe2\x80\x94bridal presents both, possessing the\r\ninestimable merit of leaving his money undisturbed in his pocket. He\r\nshook his head portentously when the captain inquired after his health\r\nand spirits. He had passed a wakeful night; ungovernable apprehensions\r\nof Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s sudden re-appearance had beset him as soon as he found\r\nhimself alone at Sea View. Sea View was redolent of Lecount: Sea View\r\n(though built on piles, and the strongest house in England) was\r\nhenceforth odious to him. He had felt this all night; he had also felt\r\nhis responsibilities. There was the lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid, to begin with. Now he\r\nhad hired her, he began to think she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. She might fall sick\r\non his hands; she might have deceived him by a false character; she and\r\nthe landlady of the hotel might have been in league together. Horrible!\r\nReally horrible to think of. Then there was the other\r\nresponsibility\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the heavier of the two\xe2\x80\x94the responsibility of\r\ndeciding where he was to go and spend his honeymoon to-morrow. He would\r\nhave preferred one of his father\xe2\x80\x99s empty houses: But except at Vauxhall\r\nWalk (which he supposed would be objected to), and at Aldborough (which\r\nwas of course out of the question) all the houses were let. He would\r\nput himself in Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Where had Mr. Bygrave spent his own\r\nhoneymoon? Given the British Islands to choose from, where would Mr.\r\nBygrave pitch his tent, on a careful review of all the circumstances?\r\n\r\nAt this point the bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s questions suddenly came to an end, and\r\nthe bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s face exhibited an expression of ungovernable\r\nastonishment. His judicious friend, whose advice had been at his\r\ndisposal in every other emergency, suddenly turned round on him, in the\r\nemergency of the honeymoon, and flatly declined discussing the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, as Noel Vanstone opened his lips to plead for a\r\nhearing, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must really excuse me. My point of view in this matter\r\nis, as usual, a peculiar one. For some time past I have been living in\r\nan atmosphere of deception, to suit your convenience. That atmosphere,\r\nmy good sir, is getting close; my Moral Being requires ventilation.\r\nSettle the choice of a locality with my niece, and leave me, at my\r\nparticular request, in total ignorance of the subject. Mrs. Lecount is\r\ncertain to come here on her return from Zurich, and is certain to ask\r\nme where you are gone. You may think it strange, Mr. Vanstone; but when\r\nI tell her I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I wish to enjoy the unaccustomed luxury of\r\nfeeling, for once in a way, that I am speaking the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, he opened the sitting-room door, introduced Noel\r\nVanstone to Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s presence, bowed himself out of the room again,\r\nand set forth alone to while away the rest of the afternoon by taking a\r\nwalk. His face showed plain tokens of anxiety, and his party-colored\r\neyes looked hither and thither distrustfully, as he sauntered along the\r\nshore. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time hangs heavy on our hands,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish to-morrow was come and gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day passed and nothing happened; the evening and the night\r\nfollowed, placidly and uneventfully. Monday came, a cloudless, lovely\r\nday; Monday confirmed the captain\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the marriage was a\r\ncertainty. Toward ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the clerk, ascending the church steps\r\nquoted the old proverb to the pew-opener, meeting him under the porch:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy the bride on whom the sun shines!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour more the wedding-party was in the vestry, and\r\nthe clergyman led the way to the altar. Carefully as the secret of the\r\nmarriage had been kept, the opening of the church in the morning had\r\nbeen enough to betray it. A small congregation, almost entirely\r\ncomposed of women, were scattered here and there among the pews.\r\nKirke\xe2\x80\x99s sister and her children were staying with a friend at\r\nAldborough, and Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s sister was one of the congregation.\r\n\r\nAs the wedding-party entered the church, the haunting terror of Mrs.\r\nLecount spread from Noel Vanstone to the captain. For the first few\r\nminutes, the eyes of both of them looked among the women in the pews\r\nwith the same searching scrutiny, and looked away again with the same\r\nsense of relief. The clergyman noticed that look, and investigated the\r\nLicense more closely than usual. The clerk began to doubt privately\r\nwhether the old proverb about the bride was a proverb to be always\r\ndepended on. The female members of the congregation murmured among\r\nthemselves at the inexcusable disregard of appearances implied in the\r\nbride\xe2\x80\x99s dress. Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s sister whispered venomously in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s ear,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God for to-day for Robert\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Wragge cried silently,\r\nwith the dread of some threatening calamity she knew not what. The one\r\nperson present who remained outwardly undisturbed was Magdalen herself.\r\nShe stood, with tearless resignation, in her place before the\r\naltar\xe2\x80\x94stood, as if all the sources of human emotion were frozen up\r\nwithin her.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman opened the Book.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was done. The awful words which speak from earth to Heaven were\r\npronounced. The children of the two dead brothers\xe2\x80\x94inheritors of the\r\nimplacable enmity which had parted their parents\xe2\x80\x94were Man and Wife.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment events hurried with a headlong rapidity to the parting\r\nscene. They were back at the house while the words of the Marriage\r\nService seemed still ringing in their ears. Before they had been five\r\nminutes indoors the carriage drew up at the garden gate. In a minute\r\nmore the opportunity came for which Magdalen and the captain had been\r\non the watch\xe2\x80\x94the opportunity of speaking together in private for the\r\nlast time. She still preserved her icy resignation; she seemed beyond\r\nall reach now of the fear that had once mastered her, of the remorse\r\nthat had once tortured her soul. With a firm hand she gave him the\r\npromised money. With a firm face she looked her last at him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nto blame,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cI have only done what you asked me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe bowed her head; she bent it toward him kindly and let him touch her\r\nfore-head with his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy last words are\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s sake take care when I\xe2\x80\x99m gone!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned from him with a smile,\r\nand spoke her farewell words to his wife. Mrs. Wragge tried hard to\r\nface her loss bravely\xe2\x80\x94the loss of the friend whose presence had fallen\r\nlike light from Heaven over the dim pathway of her life. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been\r\nvery good to me, my dear; I thank you kindly; I thank you with all my\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d She could say no more; she clung to Magdalen in a passion of\r\ntears, as her mother might have clung to her, if her mother had lived\r\nto see that horrible day. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m frightened for you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the poor\r\ncreature, in a wild, wailing voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling, I\xe2\x80\x99m frightened for\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalen desperately drew herself free\xe2\x80\x94kissed her\xe2\x80\x94and hurried out\r\nto the door. The expression of that artless gratitude, the cry of that\r\nguileless love, shook her as nothing else had shaken her that day. It\r\nwas a refuge to get to the carriage\xe2\x80\x94a refuge, though the man she had\r\nmarried stood there waiting for her at the door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wragge tried to follow her into the garden. But the captain had\r\nseen Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s face as she ran out, and he steadily held his wife back\r\nin the passage. From that distance the last farewells were exchanged.\r\nAs long as the carriage was in sight, Magdalen looked back at them; she\r\nwaved her handkerchief as she turned the corner. In a moment more the\r\nlast thread which bound her to them was broken; the familiar\r\ncompanionship of many months was a thing of the past already!\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge closed the house door on the idlers who were looking in\r\nfrom the Parade. He led his wife back into the sitting-room, and spoke\r\nto her with a forbearance which she had never yet experienced from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone her way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand in another hour we shall have\r\ngone ours. Cry your cry out\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny she\xe2\x80\x99s worth crying for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven then\xe2\x80\x94even when the dread of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s future was at its darkest\r\nin his mind\xe2\x80\x94the ruling habit of the man\xe2\x80\x99s life clung to him.\r\nMechanically he unlocked his dispatch-box. Mechanically he opened his\r\nBook of Accounts, and made the closing entry\xe2\x80\x94the entry of his last\r\ntransaction with Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94in black and white. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Rec\xe2\x80\x99d from Miss\r\nVanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the captain, with a gloomy brow, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Wragge, looking timidly at her\r\nhusband through her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI want a word of comfort, captain. Oh, do\r\ntell me, when shall I see her again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain closed the book, and answered in one inexorable word:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween eleven and twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night Mrs. Lecount drove into\r\nZurich.\r\n\r\nHer brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, when she stopped before it, was shut up. With some\r\ndifficulty and delay the servant was aroused. She held up her hands in\r\nspeechless amazement when she opened the door and saw who the visitor\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my brother alive?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount, entering the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlive!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the servant. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone holiday-making into the\r\ncountry, to finish his recovery in the fine fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper staggered back against the wall of the passage. The\r\ncoachman and the servant put her into a chair. Her face was livid, and\r\nher teeth chattered in her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend for my brother\xe2\x80\x99s doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as soon as she could speak.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came. She handed him a letter before he could say a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you write that letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked it over rapidly, and answered her without hesitation,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your handwriting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a forgery of my handwriting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose from the chair with a new strength in her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen does the return mail start for Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend instantly and take me a place in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant hesitated, the doctor protested. She turned a deaf ear to\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend!\xe2\x80\x9d she reiterated, \xe2\x80\x9cor I will go myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey obeyed. The servant went to take the place: the doctor remained\r\nand held a conversation with Mrs. Lecount. When the half-hour had\r\npassed, he helped her into her place in the mail, and charged the\r\nconductor privately to take care of his passenger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has traveled from England without stopping,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nshe is traveling back again without rest. Be careful of her, or she\r\nwill break down under the double journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mail started. Before the first hour of the new day was at an end\r\nMrs. Lecount was on her way back to England.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FOURTH SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\r\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nFrom George Bartram to Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Crux, September 4th, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Noel,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are two plain questions at starting. In the name of all that is\r\nmysterious, what are you hiding for? And why is everything relating to\r\nyour marriage kept an impenetrable secret from your oldest friends?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been to Aldborough to try if I could trace you from that place,\r\nand have come back as wise as I went. I have applied to your lawyer in\r\nLondon, and have been told, in reply, that you have forbidden him to\r\ndisclose the place of your retreat to any one without first receiving\r\nyour permission to do so. All I could prevail on him to say was, that\r\nhe would forward any letter which might be sent to his care. I write\r\naccordingly, and mind this, I expect an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may ask, in your ill-tempered way, what business I have to meddle\r\nwith affairs of yours which it is your pleasure to keep private. My\r\ndear Noel, there is a serious reason for our opening communications\r\nwith you from this house. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what events have taken place\r\nat St. Crux since you ran away to get married; and though I detest\r\nwriting letters, I must lose an hour\xe2\x80\x99s shooting to-day in trying to\r\nenlighten you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the twenty-third of last month, the admiral and I were disturbed\r\nover our wine after dinner by the announcement that a visitor had\r\nunexpectedly arrived at St. Crux. Who do you think the visitor was?\r\nMrs. Lecount!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle, with that old-fashioned bachelor gallantry of his which pays\r\nequal respect to all wearers of petticoats, left the table directly to\r\nwelcome Mrs. Lecount. While I was debating whether I should follow him\r\nor not, my meditations were suddenly brought to an end by a loud call\r\nfrom the admiral. I ran into the morning-room, and there was your\r\nunfortunate housekeeper on the sofa, with all the women servants about\r\nher, more dead than alive. She had traveled from England to Zurich, and\r\nfrom Zurich back again to England, without stopping; and she looked,\r\nseriously and literally, at death\xe2\x80\x99s door. I immediately agreed with my\r\nuncle that the first thing to be done was to send for medical help. We\r\ndispatched a groom on the spot, and, at Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s own request,\r\nsent all the servants in a body out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as we were alone, Mrs. Lecount surprised us by a singular\r\nquestion. She asked if you had received a letter which she had\r\naddressed to you before leaving England at this house. When we told her\r\nthat the letter had been forwarded, under cover to your friend Mr.\r\nBygrave, by your own particular request, she turned as pale as ashes;\r\nand when we added that you had left us in company with this same Mr.\r\nBygrave, she clasped her hands and stared at us as if she had taken\r\nleave of her senses. Her next question was, \xe2\x80\x98Where is Mr. Noel now?\xe2\x80\x99 We\r\ncould only give her one reply\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Noel had not informed us. She looked\r\nperfectly thunderstruck at that answer. \xe2\x80\x98He has gone to his ruin!\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98He has gone away in company with the greatest villain in\r\nEngland. I must find him! I tell you I must find Mr. Noel! If I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind him at once, it will be too late. He will be married!\xe2\x80\x99 she burst\r\nout quite frantically. \xe2\x80\x98On my honor and my oath, he will be married!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe admiral, incautiously perhaps, but with the best intentions, told\r\nher you were married already. She gave a scream that made the windows\r\nring again and dropped back on the sofa in a fainting-fit. The doctor\r\ncame in the nick of time, and soon brought her to. But she was taken\r\nill the same night; she has grown worse and worse ever since; and the\r\nlast medical report is, that the fever from which she has been\r\nsuffering is in a fair way to settle on her brain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my dear Noel, neither my uncle nor I have any wish to intrude\r\nourselves on your confidence. We are naturally astonished at the\r\nextraordinary mystery which hangs over you and your marriage, and we\r\ncannot be blind to the fact that your housekeeper has, apparently, some\r\nstrong reason of her own for viewing Mrs. Noel Vanstone with an enmity\r\nand distrust which we are quite ready to believe that lady has done\r\nnothing to deserve. Whatever strange misunderstanding there may have\r\nbeen in your household, is your business (if you choose to keep it to\r\nyourself), and not ours. All we have any right to do is to tell you\r\nwhat the doctor says. His patient has been delirious; he declines to\r\nanswer for her life if she goes on as she is going on now; and he\r\nthinks\xe2\x80\x94finding that she is perpetually talking of her master\xe2\x80\x94that your\r\npresence would be useful in quieting her, if you could come here at\r\nonce, and exert your influence before it is too late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say? Will you emerge from the darkness that surrounds you\r\nand come to St. Crux? If this was the case of an ordinary servant, I\r\ncould understand your hesitating to leave the delights of your\r\nhoneymoon for any such object as is here proposed to you. But, my dear\r\nfellow, Mrs. Lecount is not an ordinary servant. You are under\r\nobligations to her fidelity and attachment in your father\xe2\x80\x99s time, as\r\nwell as in your own; and if you _can_ quiet the anxieties which seem to\r\nbe driving this unfortunate woman mad, I really think you ought to come\r\nhere and do so. Your leaving Mrs. Noel Vanstone is of course out of the\r\nquestion. There is no necessity for any such hard-hearted proceeding.\r\nThe admiral desires me to remind you that he is your oldest friend\r\nliving, and that his house is at your wife\xe2\x80\x99s disposal, as it has always\r\nbeen at yours. In this great rambling-place she need dread no near\r\nassociation with the sick-room; and, with all my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s oddities, I am\r\nsure she will not think the offer of his friendship an offer to be\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I told you already that I went to Aldborough to try and find a\r\nclue to your whereabouts? I can\xe2\x80\x99t be at the trouble of looking back to\r\nsee; so, if I have told you, I tell you again. The truth is, I made an\r\nacquaintance at Aldborough of whom you know something\xe2\x80\x94at least by\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter applying vainly at Sea View, I went to the hotel to inquire\r\nabout you. The landlady could give me no information; but the moment I\r\nmentioned your name, she asked if I was related to you; and when I told\r\nher I was your cousin, she said there was a young lady then at the\r\nhotel whose name was Vanstone also, who was in great distress about a\r\nmissing relative, and who might prove of some use to me\xe2\x80\x94or I to her\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nwe knew of each other\xe2\x80\x99s errand at Aldborough. I had not the least idea\r\nwho she was, but I sent in my card at a venture; and in five minutes\r\nafterward I found myself in the presence of one of the most charming\r\nwomen these eyes ever looked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur first words of explanation informed me that my family name was\r\nknown to her by repute. Who do you think she was? The eldest daughter\r\nof my uncle and yours\xe2\x80\x94Andrew Vanstone. I had often heard my poor mother\r\nin past years speak of her brother Andrew, and I knew of that sad story\r\nat Combe-Raven. But our families, as you are aware, had always been\r\nestranged, and I had never seen my charming cousin before. She has the\r\ndark eyes and hair, and the gentle, retiring manners that I always\r\nadmire in a woman. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to renew our old disagreement about\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to those two sisters, or to deny that his brother\r\nAndrew may have behaved badly to him; I am willing to admit that the\r\nhigh moral position he took in the matter is quite unassailable by such\r\na miserable sinner as I am; and I will not dispute that my own\r\nspendthrift habits incapacitate me from offering any opinion on the\r\nconduct of other people\xe2\x80\x99s pecuniary affairs. But, with all these\r\nallowances and drawbacks, I can tell you one thing, Noel. If you ever\r\nsee the elder Miss Vanstone, I venture to prophesy that, for the first\r\ntime in your life, you will doubt the propriety of following your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s example.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me her little story, poor thing, most simply and\r\nunaffectedly. She is now occupying her second situation as a\r\ngoverness\xe2\x80\x94and, as usual, I, who know everybody, know the family. They\r\nare friends of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, whom he has lost sight of latterly\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nTyrrels of Portland Place\xe2\x80\x94and they treat Miss Vanstone with as much\r\nkindness and consideration as if she was a member of the family. One of\r\ntheir old servants accompanied her to Aldborough, her object in\r\ntraveling to that place being what the landlady of the hotel had stated\r\nit to be. The family reverses have, it seems, had a serious effect on\r\nMiss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s younger sister, who has left her friends and who has\r\nbeen missing from home for some time. She had been last heard of at\r\nAldborough; and her elder sister, on her return from the Continent with\r\nthe Tyrrels, had instantly set out to make inquiries at that place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was all Miss Vanstone told me. She asked whether you had seen\r\nanything of her sister, or whether Mrs. Lecount knew anything of her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x94I suppose because she was aware you had been at Aldborough. Of\r\ncourse I could tell her nothing. She entered into no details on the\r\nsubject, and I could not presume to ask her for any. All I did was to\r\nset to work with might and main to assist her inquiries. The attempt\r\nwas an utter failure; nobody could give us any information. We tried\r\npersonal description of course; and strange to say, the only young lady\r\nformerly staying at Aldborough who answered the description was, of all\r\nthe people in the world, the lady you have married! If she had not had\r\nan uncle and aunt (both of whom have left the place), I should have\r\nbegun to suspect that you had married your cousin without knowing it!\r\nIs this the clue to the mystery? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry; I must have my little\r\njoke, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help writing as carelessly as I talk. The end of it\r\nwas, our inquiries were all baffled, and I traveled back with Miss\r\nVanstone and her attendant as far as our station here. I think I shall\r\ncall on the Tyrrels when I am next in London. I have certainly treated\r\nthat family with the most inexcusable neglect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am at the end of my third sheet of note-paper! I don\xe2\x80\x99t often\r\ntake the pen in hand; but when I do, you will agree with me that I am\r\nin no hurry to lay it aside again. Treat the rest of my letter as you\r\nlike, but consider what I have told you about Mrs. Lecount, and\r\nremember that time is of consequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEORGE BARTRAM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nFrom Norah Vanstone to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPortland Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore sorrow, more disappointment! I have just returned from\r\nAldborough, without making any discovery. Magdalen is still lost to us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot attribute this new overthrow of my hopes to any want of\r\nperseverance or penetration in making the necessary inquiries. My\r\ninexperience in such matters was most kindly and unexpectedly assisted\r\nby Mr. George Bartram. By a strange coincidence, he happened to be at\r\nAldborough, inquiring after Mr. Noel Vanstone, at the very time when I\r\nwas there inquiring after Magdalen. He sent in his card, and knowing,\r\nwhen I looked at the name, that he was my cousin\xe2\x80\x94if I may call him so\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthought there would be no impropriety in my seeing him and asking his\r\nadvice. I abstained from entering into particulars for Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nand I made no allusion to that letter of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s which you\r\nanswered for me. I only told him Magdalen was missing, and had been\r\nlast heard of at Aldborough. The kindness which he showed in devoting\r\nhimself to my assistance exceeds all description. He treated me, in my\r\nforlorn situation, with a delicacy and respect which I shall remember\r\ngratefully long after he has himself perhaps forgotten our meeting\r\naltogether. He is quite young\xe2\x80\x94not more than thirty, I should think. In\r\nface and figure, he reminded me a little of the portrait of my father\r\nat Combe-Raven\xe2\x80\x94I mean the portrait in the dining-room, of my father\r\nwhen he was a young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUseless as our inquiries were, there is one result of them which has\r\nleft a very strange and shocking impression on my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that Mr. Noel Vanstone has lately married, under mysterious\r\ncircumstances, a young lady whom he met with at Aldborough, named\r\nBygrave. He has gone away with his wife, telling nobody but his lawyer\r\nwhere he has gone to. This I heard from Mr. George Bartram, who was\r\nendeavoring to trace him, for the purpose of communicating the news of\r\nhis housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s serious illness\xe2\x80\x94the housekeeper being the same Mrs.\r\nLecount whose letter you answered. So far, you may say, there is\r\nnothing which need particularly interest either of us. But I think you\r\nwill be as much surprised as I was when I tell you that the description\r\ngiven by the people at Aldborough of Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s appearance is most\r\nstartlingly and unaccountably like the description of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance. This discovery, taken in connection with all the\r\ncircumstances we know of, has had an effect on my mind which I cannot\r\ndescribe to you\xe2\x80\x94which I dare not realize to myself. Pray come and see\r\nme! I have never felt so wretched about Magdalen as I feel now.\r\nSuspense must have weakened my nerves in some strange way. I feel\r\nsuperstitious about the slightest things. This accidental resemblance\r\nof a total stranger to Magdalen fills me every now and then with the\r\nmost horrible misgivings\xe2\x80\x94merely because Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nhappens to be mixed up with it. Once more, pray come to me; I have so\r\nmuch to say to you that I cannot, and dare not, say in writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGratefully and affectionately yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNORAH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nFrom Mr. John Loscombe (Solicitor) to George Bartram, Esq.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, London,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeptember 6th, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your note, inclosing a letter\r\naddressed to my client, Mr. Noel Vanstone, and requesting that I will\r\nforward the same to Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s present address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince I last had the pleasure of communicating with you on this\r\nsubject, my position toward my client is entirely altered. Three days\r\nago I received a letter from him, which stated his intention of\r\nchanging his place of residence on the next day then ensuing, but which\r\nleft me entirely in ignorance on the subject of the locality to which\r\nit was his intention to remove. I have not heard from him since; and,\r\nas he had previously drawn on me for a larger sum of money than usual,\r\nthere would be no present necessity for his writing to me\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94assuming that it is his wish to keep his place of residence\r\nconcealed from every one, myself included.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder these circumstances, I think it right to return you your letter,\r\nwith the assurance that I will let you know, if I happen to be again\r\nplaced in a position to forward it to its destination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour obedient servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN LOSCOMBE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nFrom Norah Vanstone to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPortland Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForget the letter I wrote to you yesterday, and all the gloomy\r\nforebodings that it contains. This morning\xe2\x80\x99s post has brought new life\r\nto me. I have just received a letter, addressed to me at your house,\r\nand forwarded here, in your absence from home yesterday, by your\r\nsister. Can you guess who the writer is?\xe2\x80\x94Magdalen!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter is very short; it seems to have been written in a hurry.\r\nShe says she has been dreaming of me for some nights past, and the\r\ndreams have made her fear that her long silence has caused me more\r\ndistress on her account than she is worth. She writes, therefore, to\r\nassure me that she is safe and well\xe2\x80\x94that she hopes to see me before\r\nlong\xe2\x80\x94and that she has something to tell me, when we meet, which will\r\ntry my sisterly love for her as nothing has tried it yet. The letter is\r\nnot dated; but the postmark is \xe2\x80\x98Allonby,\xe2\x80\x99 which I have found, on\r\nreferring to the Gazetteer, to be a little sea-side place in\r\nCumberland. There is no hope of my being able to write back, for\r\nMagdalen expressly says that she is on the eve of departure from her\r\npresent residence, and that she is not at liberty to say where she is\r\ngoing to next, or to leave instructions for forwarding any letters\r\nafter her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn happier times I should have thought this letter very far from being\r\na satisfactory one, and I should have been seriously alarmed by that\r\nallusion to a future confidence on her part which will try my love for\r\nher as nothing has tried it yet. But after all the suspense I have\r\nsuffered, the happiness of seeing her handwriting again seems to fill\r\nmy heart and to keep all other feelings out of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t send you her\r\nletter, because I know you are coming to me soon, and I want to have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing you read it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver affectionately yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNORAH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. George Bartram called on Mrs. Tyrrel to-day. He insisted on\r\nbeing introduced to the children. When he was gone, Mrs. Tyrrel laughed\r\nin her good-humored way, and said that his anxiety to see the children\r\nlooked, to her mind, very much like an anxiety to see _me_. You may\r\nimagine how my spirits are improved when I can occupy my pen in writing\r\nsuch nonsense as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV.\r\nFrom Mrs. Lecount to Mr. de Bleriot, General Agent, London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Crux, October 23d, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been long in thanking you for the kind letter which promises me\r\nyour assistance, in friendly remembrance of the commercial relations\r\nformerly existing between my brother and yourself. The truth is, I have\r\nover-taxed my strength on my recovery from a long and dangerous\r\nillness; and for the last ten days I have been suffering under a\r\nrelapse. I am now better again, and able to enter on the business which\r\nyou so kindly offer to undertake for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person whose present place of abode it is of the utmost importance\r\nto me to discover is Mr. Noel Vanstone. I have lived, for many years\r\npast, in this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s service as house-keeper; and not having\r\nreceived my formal dismissal, I consider myself in his service still.\r\nDuring my absence on the Continent he was privately married at\r\nAldborough, in Suffolk, on the eighteenth of August last. He left\r\nAldborough the same day, taking his wife with him to some place of\r\nretreat which was kept a secret from everybody except his lawyer, Mr.\r\nLoscombe, of Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. After a short time he again removed, on the\r\n4th of September, without informing Mr. Loscombe, on this occasion, of\r\nhis new place of abode. From that date to this the lawyer has remained\r\n(or has pretended to remain) in total ignorance of where he now is.\r\nApplication has been made to Mr. Loscombe, under the circumstances, to\r\nmention what that former place of residence was, of which Mr. Vanstone\r\nis known to have informed him. Mr. Loscombe has declined acceding to\r\nthis request, for want of formal permission to disclose his client\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings after leaving Aldborough. I have all these latter\r\nparticulars from Mr. Loscombe\xe2\x80\x99s correspondent\xe2\x80\x94the nephew of the\r\ngentleman who owns this house, and whose charity has given me an\r\nasylum, during the heavy affliction of my sickness, under his own roof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe the reasons which have induced Mr. Noel Vanstone to keep\r\nhimself and his wife in hiding are reasons which relate entirely to\r\nmyself. In the first place, he is aware that the circumstances under\r\nwhich he has married are such as to give me the right of regarding him\r\nwith a just indignation. In the second place, he knows that my faithful\r\nservices, rendered through a period of twenty years, to his father and\r\nto himself, forbid him, in common decency, to cast me out helpless on\r\nthe world without a provision for the end of my life. He is the meanest\r\nof living men, and his wife is the vilest of living women. As long as\r\nhe can avoid fulfilling his obligations to me, he will; and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nencouragement may be trusted to fortify him in his ingratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy object in determining to find him out is briefly this. His marriage\r\nhas exposed him to consequences which a man of ten times his courage\r\ncould not face without shrinking. Of those consequences he knows\r\nnothing. His wife knows, and keeps him in ignorance. I know, and can\r\nenlighten him. His security from the danger that threatens him is in my\r\nhands alone; and he shall pay the price of his rescue to the last\r\nfarthing of the debt that justice claims for me as my due\xe2\x80\x94no more, and\r\nno less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have now laid my mind before you, as you told me, without reserve.\r\nYou know why I want to find this man, and what I mean to do when I find\r\nhim. I leave it to your sympathy for me to answer the serious question\r\nthat remains: How is the discovery to be made? If a first trace of them\r\ncan be found, after their departure from Aldborough, I believe careful\r\ninquiry will suffice for the rest. The personal appearance of the wife,\r\nand the extraordinary contrast between her husband and herself, are\r\ncertain to be remarked, and remembered, by every stranger who sees\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you favor me with your answer, please address it to \xe2\x80\x98Care of\r\nAdmiral Bartram, St. Crux-in the-Marsh, near Ossory, Essex\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour much obliged,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVIRGINIE LECOUNT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nFrom Mr. de Bleriot to Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark\xe2\x80\x99s Buildings, Kingsland,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 25th, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate and Confidential.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hasten to reply to your favor of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s date. Circumstances have\r\nenabled me to forward your interests, by consulting a friend of mine\r\npossessing great experience in the management of private inquiries of\r\nall sorts. I have placed your case before him (without mentioning\r\nnames); and I am happy to inform you that my views and his views of the\r\nproper course to take agree in every particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth myself and friend, then, are of opinion that little or nothing\r\ncan be done toward tracing the parties you mention, until the place of\r\ntheir temporary residence after they left Aldborough has been\r\ndiscovered first. If this can be done, the sooner it is done the\r\nbetter. Judging from your letter, some weeks must have passed since the\r\nlawyer received his information that they had shifted their quarters.\r\nAs they are both remarkable-looking people, the strangers who may have\r\nassisted them on their travels have probably not forgotten them yet.\r\nNevertheless, expedition is desirable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question for you to consider is, whether they may not possibly\r\nhave communicated the address of which we stand in need to some other\r\nperson besides the lawyer. The husband may have written to members of\r\nhis family, or the wife may have written to members of her family. Both\r\nmyself and friend are of opinion that the latter chance is the likelier\r\nof the two. If you have any means of access in the direction of the\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s family, we strongly recommend you to make use of them. If not,\r\nplease supply us with the names of any of her near relations or\r\nintimate female friends whom you know, and we will endeavor to get\r\naccess for you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn any case, we request you will at once favor us with the most exact\r\npersonal description that can be written of both the parties. We may\r\nrequire your assistance, in this important particular, at five minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnotice. Favor us, therefore, with the description by return of post. In\r\nthe meantime, we will endeavor to ascertain on our side whether any\r\ninformation is to be privately obtained at Mr. Loscombe\xe2\x80\x99s office. The\r\nlawyer himself is probably altogether beyond our reach. But if any one\r\nof his clerks can be advantageously treated with on such terms as may\r\nnot overtax your pecuniary resources, accept my assurance that the\r\nopportunity shall be made the most of by,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear madam,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour faithful servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALFRED DE BLERIOT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nFrom Mr. Pendril to Norah Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerle Street, October 27th. 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MISS VANSTONE,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady named Lecount (formerly attached to Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s service\r\nin the capacity of housekeeper) has called at my office this morning,\r\nand has asked me to furnish her with your address. I have begged her to\r\nexcuse my immediate compliance with her request, and to favor me with a\r\ncall to-morrow morning, when I shall be prepared to meet her with a\r\ndefinite answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy hesitation in this matter does not proceed from any distrust of\r\nMrs. Lecount personally, for I know nothing whatever to her prejudice.\r\nBut in making her request to me, she stated that the object of the\r\ndesired interview was to speak to you privately on the subject of your\r\nsister. Forgive me for acknowledging that I determined to withhold the\r\naddress as soon as I heard this. You will make allowances for your old\r\nfriend, and your sincere well-wisher? You will not take it amiss if I\r\nexpress my strong disapproval of your allowing yourself, on any\r\npretense whatever, to be mixed up for the future with your sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not distress you by saying more than this. But I feel too deep\r\nan interest in your welfare, and too sincere an admiration of the\r\npatience with which you have borne all your trials, to say less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I cannot prevail on you to follow my advice, you have only to say\r\nso, and Mrs. Lecount shall have your address to-morrow. In this case\r\n(which I cannot contemplate without the greatest unwillingness), let me\r\nat least recommend you to stipulate that Miss Garth shall be present at\r\nthe interview. In any matter with which your sister is concerned, you\r\nmay want an old friend\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and an old friend\xe2\x80\x99s protection against\r\nyour own generous impulses. If I could have helped you in this way, I\r\nwould; but Mrs. Lecount gave me indirectly to understand that the\r\nsubject to be discussed was of too delicate a nature to permit of my\r\npresence. Whatever this objection may be really worth, it cannot apply\r\nto Miss Garth, who has brought you both up from childhood. I say,\r\nagain, therefore, if you see Mrs. Lecount, see her in Miss Garth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways most truly yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWILLIAM PENDRIL.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nFrom Norah Vanstone to Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPortland Place, Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. PENDRIL,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am ungrateful for your kindness. Indeed, indeed I\r\nam not! But I must see Mrs. Lecount. You were not aware when you wrote\r\nto me that I had received a few lines from Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94not telling me\r\nwhere she is, but holding out the hope of our meeting before long.\r\nPerhaps Mrs. Lecount may have something to say to me on this very\r\nsubject. Even if it should not be so, my sister\xe2\x80\x94do what she may\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nstill my sister. I can\xe2\x80\x99t desert her; I can\xe2\x80\x99t turn my back on any one\r\nwho comes to me in her name. You know, dear Mr. Pendril, I have always\r\nbeen obstinate on this subject, and you have always borne with me. Let\r\nme owe another obligation to you which I can never return, and bear\r\nwith me still!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeed I say that I willingly accept that part of your advice which\r\nrefers to Miss Garth? I have already written to beg that she will come\r\nhere at four to-morrow afternoon. When you see Mrs. Lecount, please\r\ninform her that Miss Garth will be with me, and that she will find us\r\nboth ready to receive her here to-morrow at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGratefully yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNORAH VANSTONE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nFrom Mr. de Bleriot to Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark\xe2\x80\x99s Buildings, October 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of Mr. Loscombe\xe2\x80\x99s clerks has proved amenable to a small pecuniary\r\nconsideration, and has mentioned a circumstance which it may be of some\r\nimportance to you to know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly a month since, accident gave the clerk in question an\r\nopportunity of looking into one of the documents on his master\xe2\x80\x99s table,\r\nwhich had attracted his attention from a slight peculiarity in the form\r\nand color of the paper. He had only time, during Mr. Loscombe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmomentary absence, to satisfy his curiosity by looking at the beginning\r\nof the document and at the end. At the beginning he saw the customary\r\nform used in making a will; at the end he discovered the signature of\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone, with the names of two attesting witnesses, and the\r\ndate (of which he is quite certain)\xe2\x80\x94_the thirtieth of September last._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the clerk had time to make any further investigations, his\r\nmaster returned, sorted the papers on the table, and carefully locked\r\nup the will in the strong box devoted to the custody of Mr. Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s documents. It has been ascertained that, at the close of\r\nSeptember, Mr. Loscombe was absent from the office. If he was then\r\nemployed in superintending the execution of his client\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94which is\r\nquite possible\xe2\x80\x94it follows clearly that he was in the secret of Mr.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s address after the removal of the 4th of September; and if\r\nyou can do nothing on your side, it may be desirable to have the lawyer\r\nwatched on ours. In any case, it is certainly ascertained that Mr. Noel\r\nVanstone has made his will since his marriage. I leave you to draw your\r\nown conclusions from that fact, and remain, in the hope of hearing from\r\nyou shortly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour faithful servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALFRED DE BLERIOT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\nFrom Miss Garth to Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPortland Place, October 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lecount has just left us. If it was not too late to wish, I\r\nshould wish, from the bottom of my heart, that Norah had taken your\r\nadvice, and had refused to see her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write in such distress of mind that I cannot hope to give you a\r\nclear and complete account of the interview. I can only tell you\r\nbriefly what Mrs. Lecount has done, and what our situation now is. The\r\nrest must be left until I am more composed, and until I can speak to\r\nyou personally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will remember my informing you of the letter which Mrs. Lecount\r\naddressed to Norah from Aldborough, and which I answered for her in her\r\nabsence. When Mrs. Lecount made her appearance to-day, her first words\r\nannounced to us that she had come to renew the subject. As well as I\r\ncan remember it, this is what she said, addressing herself to Norah:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I wrote to you on the subject of your sister, Miss Vanstone, some\r\nlittle time since, and Miss Garth was so good as to answer the letter.\r\nWhat I feared at that time has come true. Your sister has defied all my\r\nefforts to check her; she has disappeared in company with my master,\r\nMr. Noel Vanstone; and she is now in a position of danger which may\r\nlead to her disgrace and ruin at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. It is my interest\r\nto recover my master, it is your interest to save your sister. Tell\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94for time is precious\xe2\x80\x94have you any news of her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah answered, as well as her terror and distress would allow her, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave had a letter, but there was no address on it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lecount asked, \xe2\x80\x98Was there no postmark on the envelope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes; Allonby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Allonby is better than nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x98Allonby may help\r\nyou to trace her. Where is Allonby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah told her. It all passed in a minute. I had been too much\r\nconfused and startled to interfere before, but I composed myself\r\nsufficiently to interfere now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have entered into no particulars,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98You have only\r\nfrightened us\xe2\x80\x94you have told us nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You shall hear the particulars, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Lecount; \xe2\x80\x98and you\r\nand Miss Vanstone shall judge for yourselves if I have frightened you\r\nwithout a cause.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon this, she entered at once upon a long narrative, which I cannot\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmight almost say, which I dare not\xe2\x80\x94repeat. You will understand the\r\nhorror we both felt when I tell you the end. If Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstatement is to be relied on, Magdalen has carried her mad resolution\r\nof recovering her father\xe2\x80\x99s fortune to the last and most desperate\r\nextremity\xe2\x80\x94she has married Michael Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s son under a false name.\r\nHer husband is at this moment still persuaded that her maiden name was\r\nBygrave, and that she is really the niece of a scoundrel who assisted\r\nher imposture, and whom I recognize, by the description of him, to have\r\nbeen Captain Wragge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spare you Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s cool avowal, when she rose to leave us, of\r\nher own mercenary motives in wishing to discover her master and to\r\nenlighten him. I spare you the hints she dropped of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s purpose\r\nin contracting this infamous marriage. The one aim and object of my\r\nletter is to implore you to assist me in quieting Norah\xe2\x80\x99s anguish of\r\nmind. The shock she has received at hearing this news of her sister is\r\nnot the worst result of what has happened. She has persuaded herself\r\nthat the answers she innocently gave, in her distress, to Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s questions on the subject of her letter\xe2\x80\x94the answers wrung from\r\nher under the sudden pressure of confusion and alarm\xe2\x80\x94may be used to\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice by the woman who purposely startled her into\r\ngiving the information. I can only prevent her from taking some\r\ndesperate step on her side\xe2\x80\x94some step by which she may forfeit the\r\nfriendship and protection of the excellent people with whom she is now\r\nliving\xe2\x80\x94by reminding her that if Mrs. Lecount traces her master by means\r\nof the postmark on the letter, we may trace Magdalen at the same time,\r\nand by the same means. Whatever objection you may personally feel to\r\nrenewing the efforts for the rescue of this miserable girl which failed\r\nso lamentably at York, I entreat you, for Norah\xe2\x80\x99s sake, to take the\r\nsame steps now which we took then. Send me the only assurance which\r\nwill quiet her\xe2\x80\x94the assurance, under your own hand, that the search on\r\nour side has begun. If you will do this, you may trust me, when the\r\ntime comes, to stand between these two sisters, and to defend Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npeace, character, and future prosperity at any price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost sincerely yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHARRIET GARTH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nFrom Mrs. Lecount to Mr. de Bleriot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found the trace you wanted. Mrs. Noel Vanstone has written to\r\nher sister. The letter contains no address, but the postmark is\r\nAllonby, in Cumberland. From Allonby, therefore, the inquiries must\r\nbegin. You have already in your possession the personal description of\r\nboth husband and wife. I urgently recommend you not to lose one\r\nunnecessary moment. If it is possible to send to Cumberland immediately\r\non receipt of this letter, I beg you will do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have another word to say before I close my note\xe2\x80\x94a word about the\r\ndiscovery in Mr. Loscombe\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no surprise to me to hear that Mr. Noel Vanstone has made his\r\nwill since his marriage, and I am at no loss to guess in whose favor\r\nthe will is made. If I succeed in finding my master, let that person\r\nget the money if that person can. A course to follow in this matter has\r\npresented itself to my mind since I received your letter, but my\r\nignorance of details of business and intricacies of law leaves me still\r\nuncertain whether my idea is capable of ready and certain execution. I\r\nknow no professional person whom I can trust in this delicate and\r\ndangerous business. Is your large experience in other matters large\r\nenough to help me in this? I will call at your office to-morrow at two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, for the purpose of consulting you on the subject. It is of the\r\ngreatest importance, when I next see Mr. Noel Vanstone, that he should\r\nfind me thoroughly prepared beforehand in this matter of the will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour much obliged servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVIRGINIE LECOUNT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nFrom Mr. Pendril to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerle Street, October 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only a moment to assure you of the sorrow with which I have\r\nread your letter. The circumstances under which you urge your request,\r\nand the reasons you give for making it, are sufficient to silence any\r\nobjection I might otherwise feel to the course you propose. A\r\ntrustworthy person, whom I have myself instructed, will start for\r\nAllonby to-day, and as soon as I receive any news from him, you shall\r\nhear of it by special messenger. Tell Miss Vanstone this, and pray add\r\nthe sincere expression of my sympathy and regard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaithfully yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWILLIAM PENDRIL.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\nFrom Mr. de Bleriot to Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark\xe2\x80\x99s Buildings. November 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the pleasure of informing you that the discovery has been made\r\nwith far less trouble than I had anticipated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Noel Vanstone have been traced across the Solway Firth to\r\nDumfries, and thence to a cottage a few miles from the town, on the\r\nbanks of the Nith. The exact address is Baliol Cottage, near Dumfries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis information, though easily hunted up, has nevertheless been\r\nobtained under rather singular circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore leaving Allonby, the persons in my employ discovered, to their\r\nsurprise, that a stranger was in the place pursuing the same inquiry as\r\nthemselves. In the absence of any instructions preparing them for such\r\nan occurrence as this, they took their own view of the circumstance.\r\nConsidering the man as an intruder on their business, whose success\r\nmight deprive them of the credit and reward of making the discovery,\r\nthey took advantage of their superiority in numbers, and of their being\r\nfirst in the field, and carefully misled the stranger before they\r\nventured any further with their own investigations. I am in possession\r\nof the details of their proceedings, with which I need not trouble you.\r\nThe end is, that this person, whoever he may be, was cleverly turned\r\nback southward on a false scent before the men in my employment crossed\r\nthe Firth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mention the circumstance, as you may be better able than I am to\r\nfind a clue to it, and as it may possibly be of a nature to induce you\r\nto hasten your journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour faithful servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALFRED DE BLERIOT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\nFrom Mrs. Lecount to Mr. de Bleriot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne line to say that your letter has just reached me at my lodging in\r\nLondon. I think I know who sent the strange man to inquire at Allonby.\r\nIt matters little. Before he finds out his mistake, I shall be at\r\nDumfries. My luggage is packed, and I start for the North by the next\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour deeply obliged,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVIRGINIE LECOUNT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH SCENE.\r\nBALIOL COTTAGE, DUMFRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nToward eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, on the morning of the third of November, the\r\nbreakfast-table at Baliol Cottage presented that essentially\r\ncomfortless appearance which is caused by a meal in a state of\r\ntransition\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, by a meal prepared for two persons, which\r\nhas been already eaten by one, and which has not yet been approached by\r\nthe other. It must be a hardy appetite which can contemplate without a\r\nmomentary discouragement the battered egg-shell, the fish half stripped\r\nto a skeleton, the crumbs in the plate, and the dregs in the cup. There\r\nis surely a wise submission to those weaknesses in human nature which\r\nmust be respected and not reproved, in the sympathizing rapidity with\r\nwhich servants in places of public refreshment clear away all signs of\r\nthe customer in the past, from the eyes of the customer in the present.\r\nAlthough his predecessor may have been the wife of his bosom or the\r\nchild of his loins, no man can find himself confronted at table by the\r\ntraces of a vanished eater, without a passing sense of injury in\r\nconnection with the idea of his own meal.\r\n\r\nSome such impression as this found its way into the mind of Mr. Noel\r\nVanstone when he entered the lonely breakfast-parlor at Baliol Cottage\r\nshortly after eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He looked at the table with a frown, and\r\nrang the bell with an expression of disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear away this mess,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when the servant appeared. \xe2\x80\x9cHas your\r\nmistress gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir\xe2\x80\x94nearly an hour ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Louisa downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have put the table right, send Louisa up to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked away to the window. The momentary irritation passed away from\r\nhis face; but it left an expression there which remained\xe2\x80\x94an expression\r\nof pining discontent. Personally, his marriage had altered him for the\r\nworse. His wizen little cheeks were beginning to shrink into hollows,\r\nhis frail little figure had already contracted a slight stoop. The\r\nformer delicacy of his complexion had gone\xe2\x80\x94the sickly paleness of it\r\nwas all that remained. His thin flaxen mustaches were no longer\r\npragmatically waxed and twisted into a curl: their weak feathery ends\r\nhung meekly pendent over the querulous corners of his mouth. If the ten\r\nor twelve weeks since his marriage had been counted by his locks, they\r\nmight have reckoned as ten or twelve years. He stood at the window\r\nmechanically picking leaves from a pot of heath placed in front of it,\r\nand drearily humming the forlorn fragment of a tune.\r\n\r\nThe prospect from the window overlooked the course of the Nith at a\r\nbend of the river a few miles above Dumfries. Here and there, through\r\nwintry gaps in the wooded bank, broad tracts of the level cultivated\r\nvalley met the eye. Boats passed on the river, and carts plodded along\r\nthe high-road on their way to Dumfries. The sky was clear; the November\r\nsun shone as pleasantly as if the year had been younger by two good\r\nmonths; and the view, noted in Scotland for its bright and peaceful\r\ncharm, was presented at the best which its wintry aspect could assume.\r\nIf it had been hidden in mist or drenched with rain, Mr. Noel Vanstone\r\nwould, to all appearance, have found it as attractive as he found it\r\nnow. He waited at the window until he heard Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s knock at the door,\r\nthen turned back sullenly to the breakfast-table and told her to come\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake the tea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m left here\r\nneglected. Nobody helps me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe discreet Louisa silently and submissively obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your mistress leave any message for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore she\r\nwent away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo message in particular, sir. My mistress only said she should be too\r\nlate if she waited breakfast any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she say nothing else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me at the carriage door, sir, that she would most likely be\r\nback in a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she in good spirits at the carriage door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. I thought my mistress seemed very anxious and uneasy. Is\r\nthere anything more I can do, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Wait a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe proceeded discontentedly with his breakfast. Louisa waited\r\nresignedly at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think your mistress has been in bad spirits lately,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed,\r\nwith a sudden outbreak of petulance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress has not been very cheerful, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by not very cheerful? Do you mean to prevaricate? Am\r\nI nobody in the house? Am I to be kept in the dark about everything? Is\r\nyour mistress to go away on her own affairs, and leave me at home like\r\na child\xe2\x80\x94and am I not even to ask a question about her? Am I to be\r\nprevaricated with by a servant? I won\xe2\x80\x99t be prevaricated with! Not very\r\ncheerful? What do you mean by not very cheerful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only meant that my mistress was not in good spirits, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say it, then? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know the value of words? The\r\nmost dreadful consequences sometimes happen from not knowing the value\r\nof words. Did your mistress tell you she was going to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think when your mistress told you she was going to\r\nLondon? Did you think it odd she was going without me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not presume to think it odd, sir.\xe2\x80\x94Is there anything more I can\r\ndo for you, if you please, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a morning is it out? Is it warm? Is the sun on the\r\ngarden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen the sun yourself on the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet me my great-coat; I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a little turn. Has the man brushed it?\r\nDid you see the man brush it yourself? What do you mean by saying he\r\nhas brushed it, when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him? Let me look at the tails. If\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a speck of dust on the tails, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn the man off!\xe2\x80\x94Help me on\r\nwith it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa helped him on with his coat, and gave him his hat. He went out\r\nirritably. The coat was a large one (it had belonged to his father);\r\nthe hat was a large one (it was a misfit purchased as a bargain by\r\nhimself). He was submerged in his hat and coat; he looked singularly\r\nsmall, and frail, and miserable, as he slowly wended his way, in the\r\nwintry sunlight, down the garden walk. The path sloped gently from the\r\nback of the house to the water side, from which it was parted by a low\r\nwooden fence. After pacing backward and forward slowly for some little\r\ntime, he stopped at the lower extremity of the garden, and, leaning on\r\nthe fence, looked down listlessly at the smooth flow of the river.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts still ran on the subject of his first fretful question to\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x94he was still brooding over the circumstances under which his\r\nwife had left the cottage that morning, and over the want of\r\nconsideration toward himself implied in the manner of her departure.\r\nThe longer he thought of his grievance, the more acutely he resented\r\nit. He was capable of great tenderness of feeling where any injury to\r\nhis sense of his own importance was concerned. His head drooped little\r\nby little on his arms, as they rested on the fence, and, in the deep\r\nsincerity of his mortification, he sighed bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe sigh was answered by a voice close at his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were happier with _me_, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice, in accents of tender\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nHe looked up with a scream\xe2\x80\x94literally, with a scream\xe2\x80\x94and confronted Mrs.\r\nLecount.\r\n\r\nWas it the specter of the woman, or the woman herself? Her hair was\r\nwhite; her face had fallen away; her eyes looked out large, bright, and\r\nhaggard over her hollow cheeks. She was withered and old. Her dress\r\nhung loose round her wasted figure; not a trace of its buxom autumnal\r\nbeauty remained. The quietly impenetrable resolution, the smoothly\r\ninsinuating voice\xe2\x80\x94these were the only relics of the past which sickness\r\nand suffering had left in Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompose yourself, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no cause to\r\nbe alarmed at seeing me. Your servant, when I inquired, said you were\r\nin the garden, and I came here to find you. I have traced you out, sir,\r\nwith no resentment against yourself, with no wish to distress you by so\r\nmuch as the shadow of a reproach. I come here on what has been, and is\r\nstill, the business of my life\xe2\x80\x94your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe recovered himself a little, but he was still incapable of speech. He\r\nheld fast by the fence, and stared at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to possess your mind, sir, of what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here not as your enemy, but as your friend. I have been\r\ntried by sickness, I have been tried by distress. Nothing remains of me\r\nbut my heart. My heart forgives you; my heart, in your sore need\xe2\x80\x94need\r\nwhich you have yet to feel-places me at your service. Take my arm, Mr.\r\nNoel. A little turn in the sun will help you to recover yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put his hand through her arm and marched him slowly up the garden\r\nwalk. Before she had been five minutes in his company, she had resumed\r\nfull possession of him in her own right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow down again, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGently down again, in this fine\r\nsunlight. I have much to say to you, sir, which you never expected to\r\nhear from me. Let me ask a little domestic question first. They told me\r\nat the house door Mrs. Noel Vanstone was gone away on a journey. Has\r\nshe gone for long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer master\xe2\x80\x99s hand trembled on her arm as she put that question. Instead\r\nof answering it, he tried faintly to plead for himself. The first words\r\nthat escaped him were prompted by his first returning sense\xe2\x80\x94the sense\r\nthat his housekeeper had taken him into custody. He tried to make his\r\npeace with Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always meant to do something for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, coaxingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwould have heard from me before long. Upon my word and honor, Lecount,\r\nyou would have heard from me before long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for the present,\r\nnever mind about Me. You and your interests first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking at her in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ncame you to find me out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long story, sir; I will tell it you some other time. Let it be\r\nenough to say now that I _have_ found you. Will Mrs. Noel be back again\r\nat the house to-day? A little louder, sir; I can hardly hear you. So!\r\nso! Not back again for a week! And where has she gone? To London, did\r\nyou say? And what for?\xe2\x80\x94I am not inquisitive, Mr. Noel; I am asking\r\nserious questions, under serious necessity. Why has your wife left you\r\nhere, and gone to London by herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were down at the fence again as she made that last inquiry, and\r\nthey waited, leaning against it, while Noel Vanstone answered. Her\r\nreiterated assurances that she bore him no malice were producing their\r\neffect; he was beginning to recover himself. The old helpless habit of\r\naddressing all his complaints to his housekeeper was returning already\r\nwith the re-appearance of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x94returning insidiously, in\r\ncompany with that besetting anxiety to talk about his grievances, which\r\nhad got the better of him at the breakfast-table, and which had shown\r\nthe wound inflicted on his vanity to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t answer for Mrs. Noel Vanstone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, spitefully. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nNoel Vanstone has not treated me with the consideration which is my\r\ndue. She has taken my permission for granted, and she has only thought\r\nproper to tell me that the object of her journey is to see her friends\r\nin London. She went away this morning without bidding me good-by. She\r\ntakes her own way as if I was nobody; she treats me like a child. You\r\nmay not believe it, Lecount, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know who her friends are.\r\nI am left quite in the dark; I am left to guess for myself that her\r\nfriends in London are her uncle and aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount privately considered the question by the help of her own\r\nknowledge obtained in London. She soon reached the obvious conclusion.\r\nAfter writing to her sister in the first instance, Magdalen had now, in\r\nall probability, followed the letter in person. There was little doubt\r\nthat the friends she had gone to visit in London were her sister and\r\nMiss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot her uncle and aunt, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs. Lecount, composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nsecret for your private ear! She has no uncle and aunt. Another little\r\nturn before I explain myself\xe2\x80\x94another little turn to compose your\r\nspirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took him into custody once more, and marched him back toward the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Noel!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly stopping in the middle of the walk. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou know what was the worst mischief you ever did yourself in your\r\nlife? I will tell you. That worst mischief was sending me to Zurich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hand began to tremble on her arm once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried piteously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all Mr. Bygrave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou acknowledge, sir, that Mr. Bygrave deceived _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mrs.\r\nLecount. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear that. You will be all the readier to make\r\nthe next discovery which is waiting for you\xe2\x80\x94the discovery that Mr.\r\nBygrave has deceived _you_. He is not here to slip through my fingers\r\nnow, and I am not the helpless woman in this place that I was at\r\nAldborough. Thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uttered that devout exclamation through her set teeth. All her\r\nhatred of Captain Wragge hissed out of her lips in those two words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOblige me, sir, by holding one side of my traveling-bag,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhile I open it and take something out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe interior of the bag disclosed a series of neatly-folded papers, all\r\nlaid together in order, and numbered outside. Mrs. Lecount took out one\r\nof the papers, and shut up the bag again with a loud snap of the spring\r\nthat closed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Aldborough, Mr. Noel, I had only my own opinion to support me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremarked. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own opinion was nothing against Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s youth and\r\nbeauty, and Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s ready wit. I could only hope to attack your\r\ninfatuation with proofs, and at that time I had not got them. I have\r\ngot them now! I am armed at all points with proofs; I bristle from head\r\nto foot with proofs; I break my forced silence, and speak with the\r\nemphasis of my proofs. Do you know this writing, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrank back from the paper which she offered to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\r\nwant, or what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount forced the paper into his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know what I\r\nmean, sir, if you will give me a moment\xe2\x80\x99s attention,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the\r\nday after you went away to St. Crux, I obtained admission to Mr.\r\nBygrave\xe2\x80\x99s house, and I had some talk in private with Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife. That talk supplied me with the means to convince you which I had\r\nwanted to find for weeks and weeks past. I wrote you a letter to say\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94I wrote to tell you that I would forfeit my place in your service,\r\nand my expectations from your generosity, if I did not prove to you\r\nwhen I came back from Switzerland that my own private suspicion of Miss\r\nBygrave was the truth. I directed that letter to you at St. Crux, and I\r\nposted it myself. Now, Mr. Noel, read the paper which I have forced\r\ninto your hand. It is Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s written affirmation that my\r\nletter came to St. Crux, and that he inclosed it to you, under cover to\r\nMr. Bygrave, at your own request. Did Mr. Bygrave ever give you that\r\nletter? Don\xe2\x80\x99t agitate yourself, sir! One word of reply will do\xe2\x80\x94Yes or\r\nNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read the paper, and looked up at her with growing bewilderment and\r\nfear. She obstinately waited until he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, faintly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever got the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst proof!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, taking the paper from him, and\r\nputting it back in the bag. \xe2\x80\x9cOne more, with your kind permission,\r\nbefore we come to things more serious still. I gave you a written\r\ndescription, sir, at Aldborough, of a person not named, and I asked you\r\nto compare it with Miss Bygrave the next time you were in her company.\r\nAfter having first shown the description to Mr. Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94it is useless\r\nto deny it now, Mr. Noel; your friend at North Shingles is not here to\r\nhelp you!\xe2\x80\x94after having first shown my note to Mr. Bygrave, you made the\r\ncomparison, and you found it fail in the most important particular.\r\nThere were two little moles placed close together on the left side of\r\nthe neck, in my description of the unknown lady, and there were no\r\nlittle moles at all when you looked at Miss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x99s neck. I am old\r\nenough to be your mother, Mr. Noel. If the question is not indelicate,\r\nmay I ask what the present state of your knowledge is on the subject of\r\nyour wife\xe2\x80\x99s neck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a merciless steadiness. He drew back a few\r\nsteps, cowering under her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. What do you mean by these questions? I never thought about the\r\nmoles afterward; I never looked. She wears her hair low\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has excellent reasons to wear it low, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will try and lift that hair before we have done with the subject.\r\nWhen I came out here to find you in the garden, I saw a neat young\r\nperson through the kitchen window, with her work in her hand, who\r\nlooked to my eyes like a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid. Is this young person your wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid? I beg your pardon, sir, did you say yes? In that case, another\r\nquestion, if you please. Did you engage her, or did your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI engaged her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I was away? While I was in total ignorance that you meant to\r\nhave a wife, or a wife\xe2\x80\x99s maid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder those circumstances, Mr. Noel, you cannot possibly suspect me of\r\nconspiring to deceive you, with the maid for my instrument. Go into the\r\nhouse, sir, while I wait here. Ask the woman who dresses Mrs. Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s hair morning and night whether her mistress has a mark on\r\nthe left side of her neck, and (if so) what that mark is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked a few steps toward the house without uttering a word, then\r\nstopped, and looked back at Mrs. Lecount. His blinking eyes were\r\nsteady, and his wizen face had become suddenly composed. Mrs. Lecount\r\nadvanced a little and joined him. She saw the change; but, with all her\r\nexperience of him, she failed to interpret the true meaning of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in want of a pretense, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you at a loss to\r\naccount to your wife\xe2\x80\x99s maid for such a question as I wish you to put to\r\nher? Pretenses are easily found which will do for persons in her\r\nstation of life. Say I have come here with news of a legacy for Mrs.\r\nNoel Vanstone, and that there is a question of her identity to settle\r\nbefore she can receive the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the house. He paid no attention to the sign. His face\r\ngrew paler and paler. Without moving or speaking he stood and looked at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nThose words roused him; those words lit a spark of the fire of manhood\r\nin him at last. He turned on her like a sheep on a dog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be questioned and ordered!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, trembling violently\r\nunder the new sensation of his own courage. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be threatened and\r\nmystified any longer! How did you find me out at this place? What do\r\nyou mean by coming here with your hints and your mysteries? What have\r\nyou got to say against my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount composedly opened the traveling-bag and took out her\r\nsmelling bottle, in case of emergency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have spoken to me in plain words,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn plain words, sir,\r\nyou shall have your answer. Are you too angry to listen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer looks and tones alarmed him, in spite of himself. His courage began\r\nto sink again; and, desperately as he tried to steady it, his voice\r\ntrembled when he answered her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me my answer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand give it at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour commands shall be obeyed, sir, to the letter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs.\r\nLecount. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come here with two objects. To open your eyes to your\r\nown situation, and to save your fortune\xe2\x80\x94perhaps your life. Your\r\nsituation is this. Miss Bygrave has married you under a false character\r\nand a false name. Can you rouse your memory? Can you call to mind the\r\ndisguised woman who threatened you in Vauxhall Walk? That woman\xe2\x80\x94as\r\ncertainly as I stand here\xe2\x80\x94is now your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in breathless silence, his lips falling apart, his\r\neyes fixed in vacant inquiry. The suddenness of the disclosure had\r\noverreached its own end. It had stupefied him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and burst into an imbecile laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nAt the repetition of those two words the strain on his faculties\r\nrelaxed. A thought dawned on him for the first time. His eyes fixed on\r\nher with a furtive alarm, and he drew back hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cMad!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself, with a sudden remembrance of what his friend Mr. Bygrave had\r\ntold him at Aldborough, sharpened by his own sense of the haggard\r\nchange that he saw in her face.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a whisper, but Mrs. Lecount heard him. She was close at his\r\nside again in an instant. For the first time, her self-possession\r\nfailed her, and she caught him angrily by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you put my madness to the proof, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe shook off her hold; he began to gather courage again, in the intense\r\nsincerity of his disbelief, courage to face the assertion which she\r\npersisted in forcing on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what I told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk the maid that question\r\nabout her mistress on the spot. And if she tells you the mark is there,\r\ndo one thing more. Take me up into your wife\xe2\x80\x99s room, and open her\r\nwardrobe in my presence with your own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with her wardrobe?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know when you open it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery strange!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, vacantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a scene in a\r\nnovel\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s like nothing in real life.\xe2\x80\x9d He went slowly into the house,\r\nand Mrs. Lecount waited for him in the garden.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of a few minutes only he appeared again, on the top of\r\nthe flight of steps which led into the garden from the house. He held\r\nby the iron rail with one hand, while with the other he beckoned to\r\nMrs. Lecount to join him on the steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does the maid say?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as she approached him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the\r\nmark there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d What he had heard from the maid had\r\nproduced a marked change in him. The horror of the coming discovery had\r\nlaid its paralyzing hold on his mind. He moved mechanically; he looked\r\nand spoke like a man in a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take my arm, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and, preceding her along the passage and up the\r\nstairs, led the way into his wife\xe2\x80\x99s room. When she joined him and\r\nlocked the door, he stood passively waiting for his directions, without\r\nmaking any remark, without showing any external appearance of surprise.\r\nHe had not removed either his hat or coat. Mrs. Lecount took them off\r\nfor him. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the docility of a well-trained\r\nchild. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a scene in a novel\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s like nothing in real life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bed-chamber was not very large, and the furniture was heavy and\r\nold-fashioned. But evidences of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s natural taste and refinement\r\nwere visible everywhere, in the little embellishments that graced and\r\nenlivened the aspect of the room. The perfume of dried rose-leaves hung\r\nfragrant on the cool air. Mrs. Lecount sniffed the perfume with a\r\ndisparaging frown and threw the window up to its full height. \xe2\x80\x9cPah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, with a shudder of virtuous disgust, \xe2\x80\x9cthe atmosphere of\r\ndeceit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seated herself near the window. The wardrobe stood against the wall\r\nopposite, and the bed was at the side of the room on her right hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the wardrobe, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go near it. I touch\r\nnothing in it myself. Take out the dresses with your own hand and put\r\nthem on the bed. Take them out one by one until I tell you to stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe obeyed her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it as well as I can,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy hands are\r\ncold, and my head feels half asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dresses to be removed were not many, for Magdalen had taken some of\r\nthem away with her. After he had put two dresses on the bed, he was\r\nobliged to search in the inner recesses of the wardrobe before he could\r\nfind a third. When he produced it, Mrs. Lecount made a sign to him to\r\nstop. The end was reached already; he had found the brown Alpaca dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay it out on the bed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will see a double\r\nflounce running round the bottom of it. Lift up the outer flounce, and\r\npass the inner one through your fingers, inch by inch. If you come to a\r\nplace where there is a morsel of the stuff missing, stop and look up at\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed the flounce slowly through his fingers for a minute or more,\r\nthen stopped and looked up. Mrs. Lecount produced her pocket-book and\r\nopened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery word I now speak, sir, is of serious consequence to you and to\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cListen with your closest attention. When the woman\r\ncalling herself Miss Garth came to see us in Vauxhall Walk, I knelt\r\ndown behind the chair in which she was sitting and I cut a morsel of\r\nstuff from the dress she wore, which might help me to know that dress\r\nif I ever saw it again. I did this while the woman\xe2\x80\x99s whole attention\r\nwas absorbed in talking to you. The morsel of stuff has been kept in my\r\npocketbook from that time to this. See for yourself, Mr. Noel, if it\r\nfits the gap in that dress which your own hands have just taken from\r\nyour wife\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose and handed him the fragment of stuff across the bed. He put it\r\ninto the vacant space in the flounce as well as his trembling fingers\r\nwould let him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it fit, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nThe dress dropped from his hands, and the deadly bluish pallor\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nevery doctor who attended him had warned his housekeeper to\r\ndread\xe2\x80\x94overspread his face slowly. Mrs. Lecount had not reckoned on such\r\nan answer to her question as she now saw in his cheeks. She hurried\r\nround to him, with the smelling-bottle in her hand. He dropped to his\r\nknees and caught at her dress with the grasp of a drowning man. \xe2\x80\x9cSave\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped, in a hoarse, breathless whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lecount, save\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise to save you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount; \xe2\x80\x9cI am here with the means\r\nand the resolution to save you. Come away from this place\xe2\x80\x94come nearer\r\nto the air.\xe2\x80\x9d She raised him as she spoke, and led him across the room\r\nto the window. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel the chill pain again on your left side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked, with the first signs of alarm that she had shown yet. \xe2\x80\x9cHas\r\nyour wife got any eau-de-cologne, any sal-volatile in her room? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexhaust yourself by speaking\xe2\x80\x94point to the place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a little triangular cupboard of old worm-eaten\r\nwalnut-wood fixed high in a corner of the room. Mrs. Lecount tried the\r\ndoor: it was locked.\r\n\r\nAs she made that discovery, she saw his head sink back gradually on the\r\neasy-chair in which she had placed him. The warning of the doctors in\r\npast years\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ever let him faint, you let him die\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94recurred to her\r\nmemory as if it had been spoken the day before. She looked at the\r\ncupboard again. In a recess under it lay some ends of cord, placed\r\nthere apparently for purposes of packing. Without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation, she snatched up a morsel of cord, tied one end fast round\r\nthe knob of the cupboard door, and seizing the other end in both hands,\r\npulled it suddenly with the exertion of her whole strength. The rotten\r\nwood gave way, the cupboard doors flew open, and a heap of little\r\ntrifles poured out noisily on the floor. Without stopping to notice the\r\nbroken china and glass at her feet, she looked into the dark recesses\r\nof the cupboard and saw the gleam of two glass bottles. One was put\r\naway at the extreme back of the shelf, the other was a little in\r\nadvance, almost hiding it. She snatched them both out at once, and took\r\nthem, one in each hand, to the window, where she could read their\r\nlabels in the clearer light.\r\n\r\nThe bottle in her right hand was the first bottle she looked at. It was\r\nmarked\xe2\x80\x94_Sal-volatile_.\r\n\r\nShe instantly laid the other bottle aside on the table without looking\r\nat it. The other bottle lay there, waiting its turn. It held a dark\r\nliquid, and it was labeled\xe2\x80\x94POISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount mixed the sal-volatile with water, and administered it\r\nimmediately. The stimulant had its effect. In a few minutes Noel\r\nVanstone was able to raise himself in the chair without assistance; his\r\ncolor changed again for the better, and his breath came and went more\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel now, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you warm again on\r\nyour left side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paid no attention to that inquiry; his eyes, wandering about the\r\nroom, turned by chance toward the table. To Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s surprise,\r\ninstead of answering her, he bent forward in his chair, and looked with\r\nstaring eyes and pointing hand at the second bottle which she had taken\r\nfrom the cupboard, and which she had hastily laid aside without paying\r\nattention to it. Seeing that some new alarm possessed him, she advanced\r\nto the table, and looked where he looked. The labeled side of the\r\nbottle was full in view; and there, in the plain handwriting of the\r\nchemist at Aldborough, was the one startling word confronting them\r\nboth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPoison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s self-possession was shaken by that discovery. She\r\nwas not prepared to see her own darkest forebodings\xe2\x80\x94the unacknowledged\r\noffspring of her hatred for Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94realized as she saw them realized\r\nnow. The suicide-despair in which the poison had been procured; the\r\nsuicide-purpose for which, in distrust of the future, the poison had\r\nbeen kept, had brought with them their own retribution. There the\r\nbottle lay, in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s absence, a false witness of treason which had\r\nnever entered her mind\xe2\x80\x94treason against her husband\xe2\x80\x99s life!\r\n\r\nWith his hand still mechanically pointing at the table Noel Vanstone\r\nraised his head and looked up at Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took it from the cupboard,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, answering the look. \xe2\x80\x9cI took\r\nboth bottles out together, not knowing which might be the bottle I\r\nwanted. I am as much shocked, as much frightened, as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoison!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cPoison locked up by my wife in\r\nthe cupboard in her own room.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and looked at Mrs. Lecount\r\nonce more. \xe2\x80\x9cFor _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a vacant, inquiring tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not talk of it, sir, until your mind is more at ease,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, the danger that lies waiting in this\r\nbottle shall be instantly destroyed in your presence.\xe2\x80\x9d She took out the\r\ncork, and threw the laudanum out of window, and the empty bottle after\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us try to forget this dreadful discovery for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nresumed; \xe2\x80\x9clet us go downstairs at once. All that I have now to say to\r\nyou can be said in another room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe helped him to rise from the chair, and took his arm in her own. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis well for him; it is well for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, as they went\r\ndownstairs together, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I came when I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn crossing the passage, she stepped to the front door, where the\r\ncarriage was waiting which had brought her from Dumfries, and\r\ninstructed the coachman to put up his horses at the nearest inn, and to\r\ncall again for her in two hours\xe2\x80\x99 time. This done, she accompanied Noel\r\nVanstone into the sitting-room, stirred up the fire, and placed him\r\nbefore it comfortably in an easy-chair. He sat for a few minutes,\r\nwarming his hands feebly like an old man, and staring straight into the\r\nflame. Then he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the woman came and threatened me in Vauxhall Walk,\xe2\x80\x9d he began,\r\nstill staring into the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cyou came back to the parlor after she was\r\ngone, and you told me\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, shivered a little, and lost the\r\nthread of his recollections at that point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the woman was, in my\r\nopinion, Miss Vanstone herself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t start, Mr. Noel! Your wife is\r\naway, and I am here to take care of you. Say to yourself, if you feel\r\nfrightened, \xe2\x80\x98Lecount is here; Lecount will take care of me.\xe2\x80\x99 The truth\r\nmust be told, sir, however hard to bear the truth may be. Miss Magdalen\r\nVanstone was the woman who came to you in disguise; and the woman who\r\ncame to you in disguise is the woman you have married. The conspiracy\r\nwhich she threatened you with in London is the conspiracy which has\r\nmade her your wife. That is the plain truth. You have seen the dress\r\nupstairs. If that dress had been no longer in existence, I should still\r\nhave had my proofs to convince you. Thanks to my interview with Mrs.\r\nBygrave I have discovered the house your wife lodged at in London; it\r\nwas opposite our house in Vauxhall Walk. I have laid my hand on one of\r\nthe landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, who watched your wife from an inner room, and\r\nsaw her put on the disguise; who can speak to her identity, and to the\r\nidentity of her companion, Mrs. Bygrave; and who has furnished me, at\r\nmy own request, with a written statement of facts, which she is ready\r\nto affirm on oath if any person ventures to contradict her. You shall\r\nread the statement, Mr. Noel, if you like, when you are fitter to\r\nunderstand it. You shall also read a letter in the handwriting of Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x94who will repeat to you personally every word she has written to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94a letter formally denying that she was ever in Vauxhall Walk, and\r\nformally asserting that those moles on your wife\xe2\x80\x99s neck are marks\r\npeculiar to Miss Magdalen Vanstone, whom she has known from childhood.\r\nI say it with a just pride\xe2\x80\x94you will find no weak place anywhere in the\r\nevidence which I bring you. If Mr. Bygrave had not stolen my letter,\r\nyou would have had your warning before I was cruelly deceived into\r\ngoing to Zurich; and the proofs which I now bring you, after your\r\nmarriage, I should then have offered to you before it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold me\r\nresponsible, sir, for what has happened since I left England. Blame\r\nyour uncle\xe2\x80\x99s bastard daughter, and blame that villain with the brown\r\neye and the green!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke her last venomous words as slowly and distinctly as she had\r\nspoken all the rest. Noel Vanstone made no answer\xe2\x80\x94he still sat cowering\r\nover the fire. She looked round into his face. He was crying silently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so fond of her!\xe2\x80\x9d said the miserable little creature; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nthought she was so fond of Me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount turned her back on him in disdainful silence. \xe2\x80\x9cFond of\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d As she repeated those words to herself, her haggard face became\r\nalmost handsome again in the magnificent intensity of its contempt.\r\n\r\nShe walked to a book-case at the lower end of the room, and began\r\nexamining the volumes in it. Before she had been long engaged in this\r\nway, she was startled by the sound of his voice, affrightedly calling\r\nher back. The tears were gone from his face; it was blank again with\r\nterror when he now turned it toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLecount!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding to her with both hands. \xe2\x80\x9cCan an egg be\r\npoisoned? I had an egg for breakfast this morning, and a little toast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake your mind easy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poison of your\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s deceit is the only poison you have taken yet. If she had\r\nresolved already on making you pay the price of your folly with your\r\nlife, she would not be absent from the house while you were left living\r\nin it. Dismiss the thought from your mind. It is the middle of the day;\r\nyou want refreshment. I have more to say to you in the interests of\r\nyour own safety\xe2\x80\x94I have something for you to do, which must be done at\r\nonce. Recruit your strength, and you will do it. I will set you the\r\nexample of eating, if you still distrust the food in this house. Are\r\nyou composed enough to give the servant her orders, if I ring the bell?\r\nIt is necessary to the object I have in view for you, that nobody\r\nshould think you ill in body or troubled in mind. Try first with me\r\nbefore the servant comes in. Let us see how you look and speak when you\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98Bring up the lunch.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter two rehearsals, Mrs. Lecount considered him fit to give the\r\norder, without betraying himself.\r\n\r\nThe bell was answered by Louisa\xe2\x80\x94Louisa looked hard at Mrs. Lecount. The\r\nluncheon was brought up by the house-maid\xe2\x80\x94the house-maid looked hard at\r\nMrs. Lecount. When luncheon was over, the table was cleared by the\r\ncook\xe2\x80\x94the cook looked hard at Mrs. Lecount. The three servants were\r\nplainly suspicious that something extraordinary was going on in the\r\nhouse. It was hardly possible to doubt that they had arranged to share\r\namong themselves the three opportunities which the service of the table\r\nafforded them of entering the room.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity of which she was the object did not escape the\r\npenetration of Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cI did well,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cto arm myself\r\nin good time with the means of reaching my end. If I let the grass grow\r\nunder my feet, one or the other of those women might get in my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRoused by this consideration, she produced her traveling-bag from a\r\ncorner, as soon as the last of the servants had entered the room; and\r\nseating herself at the end of the table opposite Noel Vanstone, looked\r\nat him for a moment, with a steady, investigating attention. She had\r\ncarefully regulated the quantity of wine which he had taken at\r\nluncheon\xe2\x80\x94she had let him drink exactly enough to fortify, without\r\nconfusing him; and she now examined his face critically, like an artist\r\nexamining his picture at the end of the day\xe2\x80\x99s work. The result appeared\r\nto satisfy her, and she opened the serious business of the interview on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you look at the written evidence I have mentioned to you, Mr.\r\nNoel, before I say any more?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cOr are you sufficiently\r\npersuaded of the truth to proceed at once to the suggestion which I\r\nhave now to make to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hear your suggestion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sullenly resting his elbows on\r\nthe table, and leaning his head on his hands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount took from her traveling-bag the written evidence to which\r\nshe had just alluded, and carefully placed the papers on one side of\r\nhim, within easy reach, if he wished to refer to them. Far from being\r\ndaunted, she was visibly encouraged by the ungraciousness of his\r\nmanner. Her experience of him informed her that the sign was a\r\npromising one. On those rare occasions when the little resolution that\r\nhe possessed was roused in him, it invariably asserted itself\xe2\x80\x94like the\r\nresolution of most other weak men\xe2\x80\x94aggressively. At such times, in\r\nproportion as he was outwardly sullen and discourteous to those about\r\nhim, his resolution rose; and in proportion as he was considerate and\r\npolite, it fell. The tone of the answer he had just given, and the\r\nattitude he assumed at the table, convinced Mrs. Lecount that Spanish\r\nwine and Scotch mutton had done their duty, and had rallied his sinking\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will put the question to you for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake, sir, if you wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am already certain, without any question at all,\r\nthat you have made your will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head without looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have made it in your wife\xe2\x80\x99s favor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have left her everything you possess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you exercise a reserve toward her, Mr. Noel, of your own accord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe inquired; \xe2\x80\x9cor is it possible that your wife put her own limits to\r\nher interest in your will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was uneasily silent\xe2\x80\x94he was plainly ashamed to answer the question.\r\nMrs. Lecount repeated it in a less direct form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much have you left your widow, Mr. Noel, in the event of your\r\ndeath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighty thousand pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat reply answered the question. Eighty thousand pounds was exactly\r\nthe fortune which Michael Vanstone had taken from his brother\xe2\x80\x99s orphan\r\nchildren at his brother\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94exactly the fortune of which Michael\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s son had kept possession, in his turn, as pitilessly as his\r\nfather before him. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s silence was eloquent of the\r\nconfession which he was ashamed to make. His doting weakness had,\r\nbeyond all doubt, placed his whole property at the feet of his wife.\r\nAnd this girl, whose vindictive daring had defied all restraints\xe2\x80\x94this\r\ngirl, who had not shrunk from her desperate determination even at the\r\nchurch door\xe2\x80\x94had, in the very hour of her triumph, taken part only from\r\nthe man who would willingly have given all!\xe2\x80\x94had rigorously exacted her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s fortune from him to the last farthing; and had then turned her\r\nback on the hand that was tempting her with tens of thousands more! For\r\nthe moment, Mrs. Lecount was fairly silenced by her own surprise;\r\nMagdalen had forced the astonishment from her which is akin to\r\nadmiration, the astonishment which her enmity would fain have refused.\r\nShe hated Magdalen with a tenfold hatred from that time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, after a momentary silence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nMrs. Noel gave you excellent reasons why the provision for her at your\r\ndeath should be no more, and no less, than eighty thousand pounds. And,\r\non the other hand, I am equally sure that you, in your innocence of all\r\nsuspicion, found those reasons conclusive at the time. That time has\r\nnow gone by. Your eyes are opened, sir; and you will not fail to remark\r\n(as I remark) that the Combe-Raven property happens to reach the same\r\nsum exactly, as the legacy which your wife\xe2\x80\x99s own instructions directed\r\nyou to leave her. If you are still in any doubt of the motive for which\r\nshe married you, look in your own will\xe2\x80\x94and there the motive is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his head from his hands, and became closely attentive to what\r\nshe was saying to him, for the first time since they had faced each\r\nother at the table. The Combe-Raven property had never been classed by\r\nitself in his estimation. It had come to him merged in his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nother possessions, at his father\xe2\x80\x99s death. The discovery which had now\r\nopened before him was one to which his ordinary habits of thought, as\r\nwell as his innocence of suspicion, had hitherto closed his eyes. He\r\nsaid nothing; but he looked less sullenly at Mrs. Lecount. His manner\r\nwas more ingratiating; the high tide of his courage was already on the\r\nebb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour position, sir, must be as plain by this time to you as it is to\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one obstacle now left between\r\nthis woman and the attainment of her end. _That obstacle is your life._\r\nAfter the discovery we have made upstairs, I leave you to consider for\r\nyourself what your life is worth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those terrible words, the ebbing resolution in him ran out to the\r\nlast drop. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t frighten me!\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been frightened\r\nenough already.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose, and dragged his chair after him, round the\r\ntable to Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s side. He sat down and caressingly kissed her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou good creature!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a sinking voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou excellent\r\nLecount! Tell me what to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m full of resolution\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything to\r\nsave my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got writing materials in the room, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you put them on the table, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the writing materials were in process of collection, Mrs. Lecount\r\nmade a new demand on the resources of her traveling-bag. She took two\r\npapers from it, each indorsed in the same neat commercial handwriting.\r\nOne was described as \xe2\x80\x9cDraft for proposed Will,\xe2\x80\x9d and the other as \xe2\x80\x9cDraft\r\nfor proposed Letter.\xe2\x80\x9d When she placed them before her on the table, her\r\nhand shook a little; and she applied the smelling-salts, which she had\r\nbrought with her in Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s interests, to her own nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped, when I came here, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cto have\r\ngiven you more time for consideration than it seems safe to give you\r\nnow. When you first told me of your wife\xe2\x80\x99s absence in London, I thought\r\nit probable that the object of her journey was to see her sister and\r\nMiss Garth. Since the horrible discovery we have made upstairs, I am\r\ninclined to alter that opinion. Your wife\xe2\x80\x99s determination not to tell\r\nyou who the friends are whom she has gone to see, fills me with alarm.\r\nShe may have accomplices in London\xe2\x80\x94accomplices, for anything we know to\r\nthe contrary, in this house. All three of your servants, sir, have\r\ntaken the opportunity, in turn, of coming into the room and looking at\r\nme. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like their looks! Neither you nor I know what may happen\r\nfrom day to day, or even from hour to hour. If you take my advice, you\r\nwill get the start at once of all possible accidents; and, when the\r\ncarriage comes back, you will leave this house with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the house with you. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop here by myself for any sum of money that could be offered\r\nme. What do we want the pen and ink for? Are you to write, or am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to write, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cThe means taken for\r\npromoting your own safety are to be means set in motion, from beginning\r\nto end, by yourself. I suggest, Mr. Noel\xe2\x80\x94and you decide. Recognize your\r\nown position, sir. What is your first and foremost necessity? It is\r\nplainly this. You must destroy your wife\xe2\x80\x99s interest in your death by\r\nmaking another will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe vehemently nodded his approval; his color rose, and his blinking\r\neyes brightened in malicious triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cShe shan\xe2\x80\x99t have a farthing,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself, in a whisper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe shan\xe2\x80\x99t have a farthing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen your will is made, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must place\r\nit in the hands of a trustworthy person\xe2\x80\x94not my hands, Mr. Noel; I am\r\nonly your servant! Then, when the will is safe, and when you are safe,\r\nwrite to your wife at this house. Tell her her infamous imposture is\r\ndiscovered; tell her you have made a new will, which leaves her\r\npenniless at your death; tell her, in your righteous indignation, that\r\nshe enters your doors no more. Place yourself in that strong position,\r\nand it is no longer you who are at your wife\xe2\x80\x99s mercy, but your wife who\r\nis at yours. Assert your own power, sir, with the law to help you, and\r\ncrush this woman into submission to any terms for the future that you\r\nplease to impose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe eagerly took up the pen. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a vindictive\r\nself-importance, \xe2\x80\x9cany terms I please to impose.\xe2\x80\x9d He suddenly checked\r\nhimself and his face became dejected and perplexed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I do it\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, throwing down the pen as quickly as he had taken it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I make my will, with Mr. Loscombe away in London, and no\r\nlawyer here to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount gently tapped the papers before her on the table with her\r\nforefinger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the help you need, sir, is waiting for you here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nconsidered this matter carefully before I came to you; and I provided\r\nmyself with the confidential assistance of a friend to guide me through\r\nthose difficulties which I could not penetrate for myself. The friend\r\nto whom I refer is a gentleman of Swiss extraction, but born and bred\r\nin England. He is not a lawyer by profession\xe2\x80\x94but he has had his own\r\nsufficient experience of the law, nevertheless; and he has supplied me,\r\nnot only with a model by which you may make your will, but with the\r\nwritten sketch of a letter which it is as important for us to have, as\r\nthe model of the will itself. There is another necessity waiting for\r\nyou, Mr. Noel, which I have not mentioned yet, but which is no less\r\nurgent in its way than the necessity of the will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with roused curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will take it in its turn, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cIts turn\r\nhas not come yet. The will, if you please, first. I will dictate from\r\nthe model in my possession and you will write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoel Vanstone looked at the draft for the Will and the draft for the\r\nLetter with suspicious curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I ought to see the papers myself, before you dictate,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be more satisfactory to my own mind, Lecount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Lecount, handing him the papers\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nHe read the draft for the Will first, pausing and knitting his brows\r\ndistrustfully, wherever he found blank spaces left in the manuscript to\r\nbe filled in with the names of persons and the enumeration of sums\r\nbequeathed to them. Two or three minutes of reading brought him to the\r\nend of the paper. He gave it back to Mrs. Lecount without making any\r\nobjection to it.\r\n\r\nThe draft for the Letter was a much longer document. He obstinately\r\nread it through to the end, with an expression of perplexity and\r\ndiscontent which showed that it was utterly unintelligible to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust have this explained,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a touch of his old\r\nself-importance, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I take any steps in the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be explained, sir, as we go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery word of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery word of it, Mr. Noel, when its turn comes. You have no objection\r\nto the will? To the will, then, as I said before, let us devote\r\nourselves first. You have seen for yourself that it is short enough and\r\nsimple enough for a child to understand it. But if any doubts remain on\r\nyour mind, by all means compose those doubts by showing your will to a\r\nlawyer by profession. In the meantime, let me not be considered\r\nintrusive if I remind you that we are all mortal, and that the lost\r\nopportunity can never be recalled. While your time is your own, sir,\r\nand while your enemies are unsuspicious of you, make your will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened a sheet of note-paper and smoothed it out before him; she\r\ndipped the pen in ink, and placed it in his hands. He took it from her\r\nwithout speaking\xe2\x80\x94he was, to all appearance, suffering under some\r\ntemporary uneasiness of mind. But the main point was gained. There he\r\nsat, with the paper before him, and the pen in his hand; ready at last,\r\nin right earnest, to make his will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first question for you to decide, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, after a\r\npreliminary glance at her Draft, \xe2\x80\x9cis your choice of an executor. I have\r\nno desire to influence your decision; but I may, without impropriety,\r\nremind you that a wise choice means, in other words, the choice of an\r\nold and tried friend whom you know that you can trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means the admiral, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe admiral let it be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was plainly some oppression still weighing on his mind. Even\r\nunder the trying circumstances in which he was placed it was not in his\r\nnature to take Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly sensible and disinterested\r\nadvice without a word of cavil, as he had taken it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount dictated the first paragraph from the Draft, as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last Will and Testament of me, Noel Vanstone, now living\r\nat Baliol Cottage, near Dumfries. I revoke, absolutely and in every\r\nparticular, my former will executed on the thirtieth of September,\r\neighteen hundred and forty-seven; and I hereby appoint Rear-Admiral\r\nArthur Everard Bartram, of St. Crux-in-the-Marsh, Essex, sole executor\r\nof this my will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you written those words, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount laid down the Draft; Noel Vanstone laid down the pen. They\r\nneither of them looked at each other. There was a long silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cto hear what\r\nyour wishes are in respect to the disposal of your fortune. Your\r\n_large_ fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with merciless emphasis.\r\n\r\nHe took up the pen again, and began picking the feathers from the quill\r\nin dead silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps your existing will may help you to instruct me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nMrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire to whom you left all your surplus money,\r\nafter leaving the eighty thousand pounds to your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf he had answered that question plainly, he must have said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nleft the whole surplus to my cousin, George Bartram\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the implied\r\nacknowledgment that Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s name was not mentioned in the will\r\nmust then have followed in Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s presence. A much bolder man,\r\nin his situation, might have felt the same oppression and the same\r\nembarrassment which he was feeling now. He picked the last morsel of\r\nfeather from the quill; and, desperately leaping the pitfall under his\r\nfeet, advanced to meet Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s claims on him of his own accord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not talk of any will but the will I am making now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing, Lecount\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated\xe2\x80\x94put the bare\r\nend of the quill into his mouth\xe2\x80\x94gnawed at it thoughtfully\xe2\x80\x94and said no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing is, to\xe2\x80\x94to make some provision for You?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke the last words in a tone of plaintive interrogation\xe2\x80\x94as if all\r\nhope of being met by a magnanimous refusal had not deserted him even\r\nyet. Mrs. Lecount enlightened his mind on this point, without a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s loss of time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with the tone and manner of a woman\r\nwho was not acknowledging a favor, but receiving a right.\r\n\r\nHe took another bite at the quill. The perspiration began to appear on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty is,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cto say how much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour lamented father, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cmet that\r\ndifficulty (if you remember) at the time of his last illness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were on one side of his bed, sir, and I was on the other. We were\r\nvainly trying to persuade him to make his will. After telling us he\r\nwould wait and make his will when he was well again, he looked round at\r\nme, and said some kind and feeling words which my memory will treasure\r\nto my dying day. Have you forgotten those words, Mr. Noel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Noel, without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my present situation, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cdelicacy\r\nforbids me to improve your memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch, and relapsed into silence. He clinched his\r\nhands, and writhed from side to side of his chair in an agony of\r\nindecision. Mrs. Lecount passively refused to take the slightest notice\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should you say\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d he began, and suddenly stopped again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should you say to\xe2\x80\x94a thousand pounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount rose from her chair, and looked him full in the face, with\r\nthe majestic indignation of an outraged woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the service I have rendered you to-day, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave at least earned a claim on your respect, if I have earned nothing\r\nmore. I wish you good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noel Vanstone, with the courage of despair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount folded up her papers and hung her traveling-bag over her\r\narm in contemptuous silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount moved with impenetrable dignity from the table to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount gathered her shawl round her with a shudder, and opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clasped his hands, and wrung them at her in a frenzy of rage and\r\nsuspense. \xe2\x80\x9cFive thousand\xe2\x80\x9d was the death-cry of his pecuniary suicide.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount softly shut the door again, and came back a step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree of legacy duty, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount turned on her heel and opened the door again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount came back, and resumed her place at the table as if\r\nnothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive thousand pounds, free of legacy duty, was the sum, sir, which\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s grateful regard promised me in his will,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you choose to exert your memory, as you have not chosen to\r\nexert it yet, your memory will tell you that I speak the truth. I\r\naccept your filial performance of your father\xe2\x80\x99s promise, Mr. Noel\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthere I stop. I scorn to take a mean advantage of my position toward\r\nyou; I scorn to grasp anything from your fears. You are protected by my\r\nrespect for myself, and for the Illustrious Name I bear. You are\r\nwelcome to all that I have done, and to all that I have suffered in\r\nyour service. The widow of Professor Lecompte, sir, takes what is\r\njustly hers\xe2\x80\x94and takes no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke those words, the traces of sickness seemed, for the\r\nmoment, to disappear from her face; her eyes shone with a steady inner\r\nlight; all the woman warmed and brightened in the radiance of her own\r\ntriumph\xe2\x80\x94the triumph, trebly won, of carrying her point, of vindicating\r\nher integrity, and of matching Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s incorruptible self-denial on\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s own ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are yourself again, sir, we will proceed. Let us wait a\r\nlittle first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him time to compose himself; and then, after first looking at\r\nher Draft, dictated the second paragraph of the will, in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give and bequeath to Madame Virginie Lecompte (widow of Professor\r\nLecompte, late of Zurich) the sum of Five Thousand Pounds, free of\r\nLegacy Duty. And, in making this bequest, I wish to place it on record\r\nthat I am not only expressing my own sense of Madame Lecompte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattachment and fidelity in the capacity of my housekeeper, but that I\r\nalso believe myself to be executing the intentions of my deceased\r\nfather, who, but for the circumstance of his dying intestate, would\r\nhave left Madame Lecompte, in _his_ will, the same token of grateful\r\nregard for her services which I now leave her in mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you written the last words, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount leaned across the table and offered Noel Vanstone her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe five thousand pounds is the\r\nacknowledgment on your father\xe2\x80\x99s side of what I have done for him. The\r\nwords in the will are the acknowledgment on yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint smile flickered over his face for the first time. It comforted\r\nhim, on reflection, to think that matters might have been worse. There\r\nwas balm for his wounded spirit in paying the debt of gratitude by a\r\nsentence not negotiable at his banker\xe2\x80\x99s. Whatever his father might have\r\ndone, _he_ had got Lecount a bargain, after all!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little more writing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cand your painful\r\nbut necessary duty will be performed. The trifling matter of my legacy\r\nbeing settled, we may come to the important question that is left. The\r\nfuture direction of a large fortune is now waiting your word of\r\ncommand. To whom is it to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to writhe again in his chair. Even under the all-powerful\r\nfascination of his wife the parting with his money on paper had not\r\nbeen accomplished without a pang. He had endured the pang; he had\r\nresigned himself to the sacrifice. And now here was the dreaded ordeal\r\nagain, awaiting him mercilessly for the second time!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it may assist your decision, sir, if I repeat a question which\r\nI have put to you already,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the will that\r\nyou made under your wife\xe2\x80\x99s influence, to whom did you leave the surplus\r\nmoney which remained at your own disposal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no harm in answering the question now. He acknowledged that\r\nhe had left the money to his cousin George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could have done nothing better, Mr. Noel; and you can do nothing\r\nbetter now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. George and his two sisters are\r\nyour only relations left. One of those sisters is an incurable invalid,\r\nwith more than money enough already for all the wants which her\r\naffliction allows her to feel. The other is the wife of a man even\r\nricher than yourself. To leave the money to these sisters is to waste\r\nit. To leave the money to their brother George is to give your cousin\r\nexactly the assistance which he will want when he one day inherits his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s dilapidated house and his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s impoverished estate. A will\r\nwhich names the admiral your executor and Mr. George your heir is the\r\nright will for you to make. It does honor to the claims of friendship,\r\nand it does justice to the claims of blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke warmly; for she spoke with a grateful remembrance of all that\r\nshe herself owed to the hospitality of St. Crux. Noel Vanstone took up\r\nanother pen and began to strip the second quill of its feathers as he\r\nhad stripped the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, reluctantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose George must have it\xe2\x80\x94I suppose\r\nGeorge has the principal claim on me.\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated: he looked at the\r\ndoor, he looked at the window, as if he longed to make his escape by\r\none way or the other. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lecount,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, piteously, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s such a\r\nlarge fortune! Let me wait a little before I leave it to anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo his surprise; Mrs. Lecount at once complied with this characteristic\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to wait, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI have something important to\r\nsay, before you add another line to your will. A little while since, I\r\ntold you there was a second necessity connected with your present\r\nsituation, which had not been provided for yet, but which must be\r\nprovided for, when the time came. The time has come now. You have a\r\nserious difficulty to meet and conquer before you can leave your\r\nfortune to your cousin George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat difficulty?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount rose from her chair without answering, stole to the door,\r\nand suddenly threw it open. No one was listening outside; the passage\r\nwas a solitude, from one end to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI distrust all servants,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, returning to her place\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nservants particularly. Sit closer, Mr. Noel. What I have now to say to\r\nyou must be heard by no living creature but ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of a few minutes while Mrs. Lecount opened the second\r\nof the two papers which lay before her on the table, and refreshed her\r\nmemory by looking it rapidly through. This done, she once more\r\naddressed herself to Noel Vanstone, carefully lowering her voice, so as\r\nto render it inaudible to any one who might be listening in the passage\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg your permission, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cto return to the subject\r\nof your wife. I do so most unwillingly; and I promise you that what I\r\nhave now to say about her shall be said, for your sake and for mine, in\r\nthe fewest words. What do we know of this woman, Mr. Noel\xe2\x80\x94judging her\r\nby her own confession when she came to us in the character of Miss\r\nGarth, and by her own acts afterward at Aldborough? We know that, if\r\ndeath had not snatched your father out of her reach, she was ready with\r\nher plot to rob him of the Combe-Raven money. We know that, when you\r\ninherited the money in your turn, she was ready with her plot to rob\r\n_you_. We know how she carried that plot through to the end; and we\r\nknow that nothing but your death is wanted, at this moment, to crown\r\nher rapacity and her deception with success. We are sure of these\r\nthings. We are sure that she is young, bold, and clever\xe2\x80\x94that she has\r\nneither doubts, scruples, nor pity\xe2\x80\x94and that she possesses the personal\r\nqualities which men in general (quite incomprehensibly to _me!_) are\r\nweak enough to admire. These are not fancies, Mr. Noel, but facts; you\r\nknow them as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a sign in the affirmative, and Mrs. Lecount went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep in your mind what I have said of the past, sir, and now look with\r\nme to the future. I hope and trust you have a long life still before\r\nyou; but let us, for the moment only, suppose the case of your\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94your death leaving this will behind you, which gives your fortune\r\nto your cousin George. I am told there is an office in London in which\r\ncopies of all wills must be kept. Any curious stranger who chooses to\r\npay a shilling for the privilege may enter that office, and may read\r\nany will in the place at his or her discretion. Do you see what I am\r\ncoming to, Mr. Noel? Your disinherited widow pays her shilling, and\r\nreads your will. Your disinherited widow sees that the Combe-Raven\r\nmoney, which has gone from your father to you, goes next from you to\r\nMr. George Bartram. What is the certain end of that discovery? The end\r\nis, that you leave to your cousin and your friend the legacy of this\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance and this woman\xe2\x80\x99s deceit-vengeance made more resolute,\r\ndeceit made more devilish than ever, by her exasperation at her own\r\nfailure. What is your cousin George? He is a generous, unsuspicious\r\nman; incapable of deceit himself, and fearing no deception in others.\r\nLeave him at the mercy of your wife\xe2\x80\x99s unscrupulous fascinations and\r\nyour wife\xe2\x80\x99s unfathomable deceit, and I see the end as certainly as I\r\nsee you sitting there! She will blind his eyes, as she blinded yours;\r\nand, in spite of _you_, in spite of _me_, she will have the money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and left her last words time to gain their hold on his\r\nmind. The circumstances had been stated so clearly, the conclusion from\r\nthem had been so plainly drawn, that he seized her meaning without an\r\neffort, and seized it at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, vindictively clinching his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\r\nLecount! She shan\xe2\x80\x99t have a farthing. What shall I do? Shall I leave the\r\nmoney to the admiral?\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and considered a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nresumed; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s the same danger in leaving it to the admiral that\r\nthere is in leaving it to George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no danger, Mr. Noel, if you take my advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your advice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow your own idea, sir. Take the pen in hand again, and leave the\r\nmoney to Admiral Bartram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mechanically dipped the pen in the ink, and then hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know where I am leading you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbefore you sign your will. In the meantime, let us gain every inch of\r\nground we can, as we go on. I want the will to be all written out\r\nbefore we advance a single step beyond it. Begin your third paragraph,\r\nMr. Noel, under the lines which leave me my legacy of five thousand\r\npounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dictated the last momentous sentence of the will (from the rough\r\ndraft in her own possession) in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole residue of my estate, after payment of my burial expenses\r\nand my lawful debts, I give and bequeath to Rear-Admiral Arthur Everard\r\nBartram, my Executor aforesaid; to be by him applied to such uses as he\r\nmay think fit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSigned, sealed, and delivered, this third day of November, eighteen\r\nhundred and forty-seven, by Noel Vanstone, the within-named testator,\r\nas and for his last Will and Testament, in the presence of us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noel Vanstone, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough, sir, to bequeath your fortune to the admiral; and\r\ntherefore that is all. Now let us go back to the case which we have\r\nsupposed already. Your widow pays her shilling, and sees this will.\r\nThere is the Combe-Raven money left to Admiral Bartram, with a\r\ndeclaration in plain words that it is his, to use as he likes. When she\r\nsees this, what does she do? She sets her trap for the admiral. He is a\r\nbachelor, and he is an old man. Who is to protect him against the arts\r\nof this desperate woman? Protect him yourself, sir, with a few more\r\nstrokes of that pen which has done such wonders already. You have left\r\nhim this legacy in your will\xe2\x80\x94which your wife sees. Take the legacy away\r\nagain, in a letter\xe2\x80\x94which is a dead secret between the admiral and you.\r\nPut the will and the letter under one cover, and place them in the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s possession, with your written directions to him to break the\r\nseal on the day of your death. Let the will say what it says now; and\r\nlet the letter (which is your secret and his) tell him the truth. Say\r\nthat, in leaving him your fortune, you leave it with the request that\r\nhe will take his legacy with one hand from you, and give it with the\r\nother to his nephew George. Tell him that your trust in this matter\r\nrests solely on your confidence in his honor, and on your belief in his\r\naffectionate remembrance of your father and yourself. You have known\r\nthe admiral since you were a boy. He has his little whims and oddities;\r\nbut he is a gentleman from the crown of his head to the sole of his\r\nfoot; and he is utterly incapable of proving false to a trust in his\r\nhonor, reposed by his dead friend. Meet the difficulty boldly, by such\r\na stratagem as this; and you save these two helpless men from your\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s snare, one by means of the other. Here, on one side, is your\r\nwill, which gives the fortune to the admiral, and sets her plotting\r\naccordingly. And there, on the other side, is your letter, which\r\nprivately puts the money into the nephew\xe2\x80\x99s hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe malicious dexterity of this combination was exactly the dexterity\r\nwhich Noel Vanstone was most fit to appreciate. He tried to express his\r\napproval and admiration in words. Mrs. Lecount held up her hand\r\nwarningly and closed his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, sir, before you express your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf the\r\ndifficulty is all that we have conquered yet. Let us say, the admiral\r\nhas made the use of your legacy which you have privately requested him\r\nto make of it. Sooner or later, however well the secret may be kept,\r\nyour wife will discover the truth. What follows that discovery! She\r\nlays siege to Mr. George. All you have done is to leave him the money\r\nby a roundabout way. There he is, after an interval of time, as much at\r\nher mercy as if you had openly mentioned him in your will. What is the\r\nremedy for this? The remedy is to mislead her, if we can, for the\r\nsecond time\xe2\x80\x94to set up an obstacle between her and the money, for the\r\nprotection of your cousin George. Can you guess for yourself, Mr. Noel,\r\nwhat is the most promising obstacle we can put in her way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. Mrs. Lecount smiled, and startled him into close\r\nattention by laying her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut a Woman in her way, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered in her wiliest tones.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_We_ don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in that fascinating beauty of hers\xe2\x80\x94whatever _you_\r\nmay do. _Our_ lips don\xe2\x80\x99t burn to kiss those smooth cheeks. _Our_ arms\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t long to be round that supple waist. _We_ see through her smiles\r\nand her graces, and her stays and her padding\xe2\x80\x94she can\xe2\x80\x99t fascinate _us!_\r\nPut a woman in her way, Mr. Noel! Not a woman in my helpless situation,\r\nwho is only a servant, but a woman with the authority and the jealousy\r\nof a Wife. Make it a condition, in your letter to the admiral, that if\r\nMr. George is a bachelor at the time of your death, he shall marry\r\nwithin a certain time afterward, or he shall not have the legacy.\r\nSuppose he remains single in spite of your condition, who is to have\r\nthe money then? Put a woman in your wife\xe2\x80\x99s way, sir, once more\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nleave the fortune, in that case, to the married sister of your cousin\r\nGeorge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused. Noel Vanstone again attempted to express his opinion, and\r\nagain Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s hand extinguished him in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you approve, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take your approval for\r\ngranted. If you object, I will meet your objection before it is out of\r\nyour mouth. You may say: Suppose this condition is sufficient to answer\r\nthe purpose, why hide it in a private letter to the admiral? Why not\r\nopenly write it down, with my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s name, in the will? Only for one\r\nreason, sir. Only because the secret way is the sure way, with such a\r\nwoman as your wife. The more secret you can keep your intentions, the\r\nmore time you force her to waste in finding them out for herself. That\r\ntime which she loses is time gained from her treachery by the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x94time gained by Mr. George (if he is still a bachelor) for his\r\nundisturbed choice of a lady\xe2\x80\x94time gained, for her own security, by the\r\nobject of his choice, who might otherwise be the first object of your\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion and your wife\xe2\x80\x99s hostility. Remember the bottle we have\r\ndiscovered upstairs; and keep this desperate woman ignorant, and\r\ntherefore harmless, as long as you can. There is my advice, Mr. Noel,\r\nin the fewest and plainest words. What do you say, sir? Am I almost as\r\nclever in my way as your friend Mr. Bygrave? Can I, too, conspire a\r\nlittle, when the object of my conspiracy is to assist your wishes and\r\nto protect your friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPermitted the use of his tongue at last, Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s admiration of\r\nMrs. Lecount expressed itself in terms precisely similar to those which\r\nhe had used on a former occasion, in paying his compliments to Captain\r\nWragge. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a head you have got!\xe2\x80\x9d were the grateful words which he\r\nhad once spoken to Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s bitterest enemy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a head you\r\nhave got!\xe2\x80\x9d were the grateful words which he now spoke again to Mrs.\r\nLecount herself. So do extremes meet; and such is sometimes the\r\nall-embracing capacity of the approval of a fool!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow my head, sir, to deserve the compliment which you have paid to\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cThe letter to the admiral is not written yet.\r\nYour will there is a body without a soul\xe2\x80\x94an Adam without an Eve\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nthe letter is completed and laid by its side. A little more dictation\r\non my part, a little more writing on yours, and our work is done.\r\nPardon me. The letter will be longer than the will; we must have larger\r\npaper than the note-paper this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe writing-case was searched, and some letter paper was found in it of\r\nthe size required. Mrs. Lecount resumed her dictation; and Noel\r\nVanstone resumed his pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaliol Cottage, Dumfries,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 3d, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR ADMIRAL BARTRAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you open my Will (in which you are named my sole executor), you\r\nwill find that I have bequeathed the whole residue of my estate\xe2\x80\x94after\r\npayment of one legacy of five thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x94to yourself. It is the\r\npurpose of my letter to tell you privately what the object is for which\r\nI have left you the fortune which is now placed in your hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to consider this large legacy as intended, under certain\r\nconditions, to be given by you to your nephew George. If your nephew is\r\nmarried at the time of my death, and if his wife is living, I request\r\nyou to put him at once in possession of your legacy; accompanying it by\r\nthe expression of my desire (which I am sure he will consider a sacred\r\nand binding obligation on him) that he will settle the money on his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94and on his children, if he has any. If, on the other hand, he is\r\nunmarried at the time of my death, or if he is a widower\xe2\x80\x94in either of\r\nthose cases, I make it a condition of his receiving the legacy, that he\r\nshall be married within the period of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount laid down the Draft letter from which she had been\r\ndictating thus far, and informed Noel Vanstone by a sign that his pen\r\nmight rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have come to the question of time, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long\r\nwill you give your cousin to marry, if he is single, or a widower, at\r\nthe time of your death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I give him a year?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we had nothing to consider but the interests of Propriety,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cI should say a year too, sir\xe2\x80\x94especially if Mr. George\r\nshould happen to be a widower. But we have your wife to consider, as\r\nwell as the interests of Propriety. A year of delay, between your death\r\nand your cousin\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, is a dangerously long time to leave the\r\ndisposal of your fortune in suspense. Give a determined woman a year to\r\nplot and contrive in, and there is no saying what she may not do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix months?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix months, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cis the preferable time of\r\nthe two. A six months\xe2\x80\x99 interval from the day of your death is enough\r\nfor Mr. George. You look discomposed, sir; what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk so much about my death,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out,\r\npetulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it! I hate the very sound of the word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount smiled resignedly, and referred to her Draft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see the word \xe2\x80\x98decease\xe2\x80\x99 written here,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, Mr.\r\nNoel, you would prefer it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer \xe2\x80\x98Decease.\xe2\x80\x99 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound so dreadful as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Death.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on with the letter, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe resumed her dictation, as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c...in either of those cases, I make it a condition of his receiving\r\nthe legacy that he shall be married within the period of Six calendar\r\nmonths from the day of my decease; that the woman he marries shall not\r\nbe a widow; and that his marriage shall be a marriage by Banns,\r\npublicly celebrated in the parish church of Ossory\xe2\x80\x94where he has been\r\nknown from his childhood, and where the family and circumstances of his\r\nfuture wife are likely to be the subject of public interest and\r\ninquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, quietly looking up from the Draft, \xe2\x80\x9cis to\r\nprotect Mr. George, sir, in case the same trap is set for him which was\r\nsuccessfully set for you. She will not find her false character and her\r\nfalse name fit quite so easily next time\xe2\x80\x94no, not even with Mr. Bygrave\r\nto help her! Another dip of ink, Mr. Noel; let us write the next\r\nparagraph. Are you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your nephew fails to comply with these conditions\xe2\x80\x94that is to say,\r\nif being either a bachelor or a widower at the time of my decease, he\r\nfails to marry in all respects as I have here instructed him to marry,\r\nwithin Six calendar months from that time\xe2\x80\x94it is my desire that he shall\r\nnot receive the legacy, or any part of it. I request you, in the case\r\nhere supposed, to pass him over altogether; and to give the fortune\r\nleft you in my will to his married sister, Mrs. Girdlestone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving now put you in possession of my motives and intentions, I come\r\nto the next question which it is necessary to consider. If, when you\r\nopen this letter, your nephew is an unmarried man, it is clearly\r\nindispensable that he should know of the conditions here imposed on\r\nhim, as soon, if possible, as you know of them yourself. Are you, under\r\nthese circumstances, freely to communicate to him what I have here\r\nwritten to you? Or are you to leave him under the impression that no\r\nsuch private expression of my wishes as this is in existence; and are\r\nyou to state all the conditions relating to his marriage, as if they\r\nemanated entirely from yourself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will adopt this latter alternative, you will add one more to\r\nthe many obligations under which your friendship has placed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have serious reason to believe that the possession of my money, and\r\nthe discovery of any peculiar arrangements relating to the disposal of\r\nit, will be objects (after my decease) of the fraud and conspiracy of\r\nan unscrupulous person. I am therefore anxious\xe2\x80\x94for your sake, in the\r\nfirst place\xe2\x80\x94that no suspicion of the existence of this letter should be\r\nconveyed to the mind of the person to whom I allude. And I am equally\r\ndesirous\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs. Girdlestone\xe2\x80\x99s sake, in the second place\xe2\x80\x94that this\r\nsame person should be entirely ignorant that the legacy will pass into\r\nMrs. Girdlestone\xe2\x80\x99s possession, if your nephew is not married in the\r\ngiven time. I know George\xe2\x80\x99s easy, pliable disposition; I dread the\r\nattempts that will be made to practice on it; and I feel sure that the\r\nprudent course will be, to abstain from trusting him with secrets, the\r\nrash revelation of which might be followed by serious, and even\r\ndangerous results.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cState the conditions, therefore, to your nephew, as if they were your\r\nown. Let him think they have been suggested to your mind by the new\r\nresponsibilities imposed on you as a man of property, by your position\r\nin my will, and by your consequent anxiety to provide for the\r\nperpetuation of the family name. If these reasons are not sufficient to\r\nsatisfy him, there can be no objection to your referring him, for any\r\nfurther explanations which he may desire, to his wedding-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done. My last wishes are now confided to you, in implicit\r\nreliance on your honor, and on your tender regard for the memory of\r\nyour friend. Of the miserable circumstances which compel me to write as\r\nI have written here, I say nothing. You will hear of them, if my life\r\nis spared, from my own lips\xe2\x80\x94for you will be the first friend whom I\r\nshall consult in my difficulty and distress. Keep this letter strictly\r\nsecret, and strictly in your own possession, until my requests are\r\ncomplied with. Let no human being but yourself know where it is, on any\r\npretense whatever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear Admiral Bartram,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffectionately yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNOEL VANSTONE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you signed, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me look the letter\r\nover, if you please, before we seal it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe read the letter carefully. In Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s close, cramped\r\nhandwriting, it filled two pages of letter-paper, and ended at the top\r\nof the third page. Instead of using an envelope, Mrs. Lecount folded\r\nit, neatly and securely, in the old-fashioned way. She lit the taper in\r\nthe ink-stand, and returned the letter to the writer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeal it, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your own hand, and your own seal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe extinguished the taper, and handed him the pen again. \xe2\x80\x9cAddress the\r\nletter, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cto _Admiral Bartram, St.\r\nCrux-in-the-Marsh, Essex._ Now, add these words, and sign them, above\r\nthe address: _To be kept in your own possession, and to be opened by\r\nyourself only, on the day of my death_\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x98Decease,\xe2\x80\x99 if you prefer\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94_Noel Vanstone._ Have you done? Let me look at it again. Quite right\r\nin every particular. Accept my congratulations, sir. If your wife has\r\nnot plotted her last plot for the Combe-Raven money, it is not your\r\nfault, Mr. Noel\xe2\x80\x94and not mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding his attention released by the completion of the letter, Noel\r\nVanstone reverted at once to purely personal considerations. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nmy packing-up to be thought of now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go away without\r\nmy warm things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Lecount, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is the Will to be\r\nsigned first; and there must be two persons found to witness your\r\nsignature.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked out of the front window, and saw the carriage\r\nwaiting at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cThe coachman will do for one of the witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in respectable service at Dumfries, and he can be\r\nfound if he happens to be wanted. We must have one of your own\r\nservants, I suppose, for the other witness. They are all detestable\r\nwomen; but the cook is the least ill-looking of the three. Send for the\r\ncook, sir; while I go out and call the coachman. When we have got our\r\nwitnesses here, you have only to speak to them in these words: \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\na document here to sign, and I wish you to write your names on it, as\r\nwitnesses of my signature.\xe2\x80\x99 Nothing more, Mr. Noel! Say those few words\r\nin your usual manner\xe2\x80\x94and, when the signing is over, I will see myself\r\nto your packing-up, and your warm things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to the front door, and summoned the coachman to the parlor. On\r\nher return, she found the cook already in the room. The cook looked\r\nmysteriously offended, and stared without intermission at Mrs. Lecount.\r\nIn a minute more the coachman\xe2\x80\x94an elderly man\xe2\x80\x94came in. He was preceded\r\nby a relishing odor of whisky; but his head was Scotch; and nothing but\r\nhis odor betrayed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a document here to sign,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, repeating his\r\nlesson; \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish you to write your names on it, as witnesses of my\r\nsignature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coachman looked at the will. The cook never removed her eyes from\r\nMrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ll no object, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coachman, with the national caution\r\nshowing itself in every wrinkle on his face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cye\xe2\x80\x99ll no object, sir, to\r\ntell me, first, what the Doecument may be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount interposed before Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s indignation could\r\nexpress itself in words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must tell the man, sir, that this is your Will,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nhe witnesses your signature, he can see as much for himself if he looks\r\nat the top of the page.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coachman, looking at the top of the page\r\nimmediately. \xe2\x80\x9cHis last Will and Testament. Hech, sirs! there\xe2\x80\x99s a sair\r\nconfronting of Death in a Doecument like yon! A\xe2\x80\x99 flesh is grass,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the coachman, exhaling an additional puff of whisky, and\r\nlooking up devoutly at the ceiling. \xe2\x80\x9cTak\xe2\x80\x99 those words in connection\r\nwith that other Screepture: Many are ca\xe2\x80\x99ad, but few are chosen. Tak\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat again, in connection with Rev\xe2\x80\x99lations, Chapter the First, verses\r\nOne to Fefteen. Lay the whole to heart; and what\xe2\x80\x99s your Walth, then?\r\nDross, sirs! And your body? (Screepture again.) Clay for the potter!\r\nAnd your life? (Screepture once more.) The Breeth o\xe2\x80\x99 your Nostrils!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cook listened as if the cook was at church: but she never removed\r\nher eyes from Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better sign, sir. This is apparently some custom prevalent in\r\nDumfries during the transaction of business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount,\r\nresignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man means well, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe added those last words in a soothing tone, for she saw that Noel\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s indignation was fast merging into alarm. The coachman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noutburst of exhortation seemed to have inspired him with fear, as well\r\nas disgust.\r\n\r\nHe dipped the pen in the ink, and signed the Will without uttering a\r\nword. The coachman (descending instantly from Theology to Business)\r\nwatched the signature with the most scrupulous attention; and signed\r\nhis own name as witness, with an implied commentary on the proceeding,\r\nin the form of another puff of whisky, exhaled through the medium of a\r\nheavy sigh. The cook looked away from Mrs. Lecount with an\r\neffort\xe2\x80\x94signed her name in a violent hurry\xe2\x80\x94and looked back again with a\r\nstart, as if she expected to see a loaded pistol (produced in the\r\ninterval) in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount,\r\nin her friendliest manner. The cook shut up her lips aggressively and\r\nlooked at her master. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may go!\xe2\x80\x9d said her master. The cook coughed\r\ncontemptuously, and went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shan\xe2\x80\x99t keep you long,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, dismissing the coachman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn half an hour, or less, we shall be ready for the journey back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coachman\xe2\x80\x99s austere countenance relaxed for the first time. He\r\nsmiled mysteriously, and approached Mrs. Lecount on tiptoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ll no forget one thing, my leddy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the most\r\ningratiating politeness. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ll no forget the witnessing as weel as the\r\ndriving, when ye pay me for my day\xe2\x80\x99s wark!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed with guttural\r\ngravity; and, leaving his atmosphere behind him, stalked out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLecount,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, as soon as the coachman closed the door,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdid I hear you tell that man we should be ready in half an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you blind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe asked the question with an angry stamp of his foot. Mrs. Lecount\r\nlooked at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see the brute is drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, more and more\r\nirritably. \xe2\x80\x9cIs my life nothing? Am I to be left at the mercy of a\r\ndrunken coachman? I won\xe2\x80\x99t trust that man to drive me, for any\r\nconsideration under heaven! I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you could think of it,\r\nLecount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man has been drinking, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to see\r\nand to smell that. But he is evidently used to drinking. If he is sober\r\nenough to walk quite straight\xe2\x80\x94which he certainly does\xe2\x80\x94and to sign his\r\nname in an excellent handwriting\xe2\x80\x94which you may see for yourself on the\r\nWill\xe2\x80\x94I venture to think he is sober enough to drive us to Dumfries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort! You\xe2\x80\x99re a foreigner, Lecount; you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nthese people. They drink whisky from morning to-night. Whisky is the\r\nstrongest spirit that\xe2\x80\x99s made; whisky is notorious for its effect on the\r\nbrain. I tell you, I won\xe2\x80\x99t run the risk. I never was driven, and I\r\nnever will be driven, by anybody but a sober man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I go back to Dumfries by myself, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd leave me here? Leave me alone in this house after what has\r\nhappened? How do I know my wife may not come back to-night? How do I\r\nknow her journey is not a blind to mislead me? Have you no feeling,\r\nLecount? Can you leave me in my miserable situation\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d He sank into a\r\nchair and burst out crying over his own idea, before he had completed\r\nthe expression of it in words. \xe2\x80\x9cToo bad!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with his\r\nhandkerchief over his face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctoo bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to pity him. If ever mortal was pitiable, he was\r\nthe man. He had broken down at last, under the conflict of violent\r\nemotions which had been roused in him since the morning. The effort to\r\nfollow Mrs. Lecount along the mazes of intricate combination through\r\nwhich she had steadily led the way, had upheld him while that effort\r\nlasted: the moment it was at an end, he dropped. The coachman had\r\nhastened a result\xe2\x80\x94of which the coachman was far from being the cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me\xe2\x80\x94you distress me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount. \xe2\x80\x9cI entreat\r\nyou to compose yourself. I will stay here, if you wish it, with\r\npleasure\xe2\x80\x94I will stay here to-night, for your sake. You want rest and\r\nquiet after this dreadful day. The coachman shall be instantly sent\r\naway, Mr. Noel. I will give him a note to the landlord of the hotel,\r\nand the carriage shall come back for us to-morrow morning, with another\r\nman to drive it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prospect which those words presented cheered him. He wiped his\r\neyes, and kissed Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, faintly; \xe2\x80\x9csend\r\nthe coachman away\xe2\x80\x94and you stop here. You good creature! You excellent\r\nLecount! Send the drunken brute away, and come back directly. We will\r\nbe comfortable by the fire, Lecount\xe2\x80\x94and have a nice little dinner\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ntry to make it like old times.\xe2\x80\x9d His weak voice faltered; he returned to\r\nthe fire side, and melted into tears again under the pathetic influence\r\nof his own idea.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount left him for a minute to dismiss the coachman. When she\r\nreturned to the parlor she found him with his hand on the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell the servants to get your room ready,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish to show you every attention, Lecount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are all kindness, Mr. Noel; but wait one moment. It may be well to\r\nhave these papers put out of the way before the servant comes in again.\r\nIf you will place the Will and the Sealed Letter together in one\r\nenvelope\xe2\x80\x94and if you will direct it to the admiral\xe2\x80\x94I will take care that\r\nthe inclosure so addressed is safely placed in his own hands. Will you\r\ncome to the table, Mr. Noel, only for one minute more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo! He was obstinate; he refused to move from the fire; he was sick and\r\ntired of writing: he wished he had never been born, and he loathed the\r\nsight of pen and ink. All Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s patience and all Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion were required to induce him to write the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naddress for the second time. She only succeeded by bringing the blank\r\nenvelope to him upon the paper-case, and putting it coaxingly on his\r\nlap. He grumbled, he even swore, but he directed the envelope at last,\r\nin these terms: \xe2\x80\x9cTo Admiral Bartram, St. Crux-in-the-Marsh. Favored by\r\nMrs. Lecount.\xe2\x80\x9d With that final act of compliance his docility came to\r\nan end. He refused, in the fiercest terms, to seal the envelope. There\r\nwas no need to press this proceeding on him. His seal lay ready on the\r\ntable, and it mattered nothing whether he used it, or whether a person\r\nin his confidence used it for him. Mrs. Lecount sealed the envelope,\r\nwith its two important inclosures placed safely inside.\r\n\r\nShe opened her traveling-bag for the last time, and pausing for a\r\nmoment before she put the sealed packet away, looked at it with a\r\ntriumph too deep for words. She smiled as she dropped it into the bag.\r\nNot the shadow of a suspicion that the Will might contain superfluous\r\nphrases and expressions which no practical lawyer would have used; not\r\nthe vestige of a doubt whether the Letter was quite as complete a\r\ndocument as a practical lawyer might have made it, troubled her mind.\r\nIn blind reliance\xe2\x80\x94born of her hatred for Magdalen and her hunger for\r\nrevenge\xe2\x80\x94in blind reliance on her own abilities and on her friend\xe2\x80\x99s law,\r\nshe trusted the future implicitly to the promise of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s work.\r\n\r\nAs she locked her traveling-bag Noel Vanstone rang the bell. On this\r\noccasion, the summons was answered by Louisa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet the spare room ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said her master; \xe2\x80\x9cthis lady will sleep here\r\nto-night. And air my warm things; this lady and I are going away\r\nto-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe civil and submissive Louisa received her orders in sullen\r\nsilence\xe2\x80\x94darted an angry look at her master\xe2\x80\x99s impenetrable guest\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nleft the room. The servants were evidently all attached to their\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s interests, and were all of one opinion on the subject of\r\nMrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s done!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noel Vanstone, with a sigh of infinite relief.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit down, Lecount. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be comfortable\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s gossip over the\r\nfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount accepted the invitation and drew an easy-chair to his\r\nside. He took her hand with a confidential tenderness, and held it in\r\nhis while the talk went on. A stranger, looking in through the window,\r\nwould have taken them for mother and son, and would have thought to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a happy home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gossip, led by Noel Vanstone, consisted as usual of an endless\r\nstring of questions, and was devoted entirely to the subject of himself\r\nand his future prospects. Where would Lecount take him to when they\r\nwent away the next morning? Why to London? Why should he be left in\r\nLondon, while Lecount went on to St. Crux to give the admiral the\r\nLetter and the Will? Because his wife might follow him, if he went to\r\nthe admiral\xe2\x80\x99s? Well, there was something in that. And because he ought\r\nto be safely concealed from her, in some comfortable lodging, near Mr.\r\nLoscombe? Why near Mr. Loscombe? Ah, yes, to be sure\xe2\x80\x94to know what the\r\nlaw would do to help him. Would the law set him free from the Wretch\r\nwho had deceived him? How tiresome of Lecount not to know! Would the\r\nlaw say he had gone and married himself a second time, because he had\r\nbeen living with the Wretch, like husband and wife, in Scotland?\r\nAnything that publicly assumed to be a marriage was a marriage (he had\r\nheard) in Scotland. How excessively tiresome of Lecount to sit there\r\nand say she knew nothing about it! Was he to stay long in London by\r\nhimself, with nobody but Mr. Loscombe to speak to? Would Lecount come\r\nback to him as soon as she had put those important papers in the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s own hands? Would Lecount consider herself still in his\r\nservice? The good Lecount! the excellent Lecount! And after all the\r\nlaw-business was over\xe2\x80\x94what then? Why not leave this horrid England and\r\ngo abroad again? Why not go to France, to some cheap place near Paris?\r\nSay Versailles? say St. Germain? In a nice little French house\xe2\x80\x94cheap?\r\nWith a nice French _bonne_ to cook\xe2\x80\x94who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waste his substance in\r\nthe grease-pot? With a nice little garden\xe2\x80\x94where he could work himself,\r\nand get health, and save the expense of keeping a gardener? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nbad idea. And it seemed to promise well for the future\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nLecount?\r\n\r\nSo he ran on\xe2\x80\x94the poor weak creature! the abject, miserable little man!\r\n\r\nAs the darkness gathered at the close of the short November day he\r\nbegan to grow drowsy\xe2\x80\x94his ceaseless questions came to an end at last\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nfell asleep. The wind outside sang its mournful winter-song; the tramp\r\nof passing footsteps, the roll of passing wheels on the road ceased in\r\ndreary silence. He slept on quietly. The firelight rose and fell on his\r\nwizen little face and his nervous, drooping hands. Mrs. Lecount had not\r\npitied him yet. She began to pity him now. Her point was gained; her\r\ninterest in his will was secured; he had put his future life, of his\r\nown accord, under her fostering care\xe2\x80\x94the fire was comfortable; the\r\ncircumstances were favorable to the growth of Christian feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nwretch!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lecount, looking at him with a grave\r\ncompassion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpoor wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dinner-hour roused him. He was cheerful at dinner; he reverted to\r\nthe idea of the cheap little house in France; he smirked and simpered;\r\nand talked French to Mrs. Lecount, while the house-maid and Louisa\r\nwaited, turn and turn about, under protest. When dinner was over, he\r\nreturned to his comfortable chair before the fire, and Mrs. Lecount\r\nfollowed him. He resumed the conversation\xe2\x80\x94which meant, in his case,\r\nrepeating his questions. But he was not so quick and ready with them as\r\nhe had been earlier in the day. They began to flag\xe2\x80\x94they continued, at\r\nlonger and longer intervals\xe2\x80\x94they ceased altogether. Toward nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nhe fell asleep again.\r\n\r\nIt was not a quiet sleep this time. He muttered, and ground his teeth,\r\nand rolled his head from side to side of the chair. Mrs. Lecount\r\npurposely made noise enough to rouse him. He woke, with a vacant eye\r\nand a flushed cheek. He walked about the room restlessly, with a new\r\nidea in his mind\xe2\x80\x94the idea of writing a terrible letter; a letter of\r\neternal farewell to his wife. How was it to be written? In what\r\nlanguage should he express his feelings? The powers of Shakespeare\r\nhimself would be unequal to the emergency! He had been the victim of an\r\noutrage entirely without parallel. A wretch had crept into his bosom! A\r\nviper had hidden herself at his fireside! Where could words be found to\r\nbrand her with the infamy she deserved? He stopped, with a suffocating\r\nsense in him of his own impotent rage\xe2\x80\x94he stopped, and shook his fist\r\ntremulously in the empty air.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecount interfered with an energy and a resolution inspired by\r\nserious alarm. After the heavy strain that had been laid on his\r\nweakness already, such an outbreak of passionate agitation as was now\r\nbursting from him might be the destruction of his rest that night and\r\nof his strength to travel the next day. With infinite difficulty, with\r\nendless promises to return to the subject, and to advise him about it\r\nin the morning, she prevailed on him, at last, to go upstairs and\r\ncompose himself for the night. She gave him her arm to assist him. On\r\nthe way upstairs his attention, to her great relief, became suddenly\r\nabsorbed by a new fancy. He remembered a certain warm and comfortable\r\nmixture of wine, eggs, sugar, and spices, which she had often been\r\naccustomed to make for him in former times, and which he thought he\r\nshould relish exceedingly before he went to bed. Mrs. Lecount helped\r\nhim on with his dressing-gown\xe2\x80\x94then went down-stairs again to make his\r\nwarm drink for him at the parlor fire.\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell and ordered the necessary ingredients for the\r\nmixture, in Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s name. The servants, with the small\r\ningenious malice of their race, brought up the materials one by one,\r\nand kept her waiting for each of them as long as possible. She had got\r\nthe saucepan, and the spoon, and the tumbler, and the nutmeg-grater,\r\nand the wine\xe2\x80\x94but not the egg, the sugar, or the spices\xe2\x80\x94when she heard\r\nhim above, walking backward and forward noisily in his room; exciting\r\nhimself on the old subject again, beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\nShe went upstairs once more; but he was too quick for her\xe2\x80\x94he heard her\r\noutside the door; and when she opened it, she found him in his chair,\r\nwith his back cunningly turned toward her. Knowing him too well to\r\nattempt any remonstrance, she merely announced the speedy arrival of\r\nthe warm drink and turned to leave the room. On her way out, she\r\nnoticed a table in a corner, with an inkstand and a paper-case on it,\r\nand tried, without attracting his attention, to take the writing\r\nmaterials away. He was too quick for her again. He asked, angrily, if\r\nshe doubted his promise. She put the writing materials back on the\r\ntable, for fear of offending him, and left the room.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour more the mixture was ready. She carried it up to him,\r\nfoaming and fragrant, in a large tumbler. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will sleep after this,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe thought to herself, as she opened the door; \xe2\x80\x9cI have made it\r\nstronger than usual on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had changed his place. He was sitting at the table in the\r\ncorner\xe2\x80\x94still with his back to her, writing. This time his quick ears\r\nhad not served him; this time she caught him in the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Noel! Mr. Noel!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, reproachfully, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is your\r\npromise worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer. He was sitting with his left elbow on the table, and\r\nwith his head resting on his left hand. His right hand lay back on the\r\npaper, with the pen lying loose in it. \xe2\x80\x9cYour drink, Mr. Noel,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, in a kinder tone, feeling unwilling to offend him. He took no\r\nnotice of her. She went to the table to rouse him. Was he deep in\r\nthought?\r\n\r\nHe was dead!\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FIFTH SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\r\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nFrom Mrs. Noel Vanstone to Mr. Loscombe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPark Terrace, St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Wood, November 5th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Sir,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to London yesterday for the purpose of seeing a relative,\r\nleaving Mr. Vanstone at Baliol Cottage, and proposing to return to him\r\nin the course of the week. I reached London late last night, and drove\r\nto these lodgings, having written to secure accommodation beforehand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning\xe2\x80\x99s post has brought me a letter from my own maid, whom I\r\nleft at Baliol Cottage, with instructions to write to me if anything\r\nextraordinary took place in my absence. You will find the girl\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\ninclosed in this. I have had some experience of her; and I believe she\r\nis to be strictly depended on to tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI purposely abstain from troubling you by any useless allusions to\r\nmyself. When you have read my maid\xe2\x80\x99s letter, you will understand the\r\nshock which the news contained in it has caused me. I can only repeat\r\nthat I place implicit belief in her statement. I am firmly persuaded\r\nthat my husband\xe2\x80\x99s former housekeeper has found him out, has practiced\r\non his weakness in my absence, and has prevailed on him to make another\r\nWill. From what I know of this woman, I feel no doubt that she has used\r\nher influence over Mr. Vanstone to deprive me, if possible, of all\r\nfuture interests in my husband\xe2\x80\x99s fortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder such circumstances as these, it is in the last degree\r\nimportant\xe2\x80\x94for more reasons than I need mention here\xe2\x80\x94that I should see\r\nMr. Vanstone, and come to an explanation with him, at the earliest\r\npossible opportunity. You will find that my maid thoughtfully kept her\r\nletter open until the last moment before post-time\xe2\x80\x94without, however,\r\nhaving any later news to give me than that Mrs. Lecount was to sleep at\r\nthe cottage last night and that she and Mr. Vanstone were to leave\r\ntogether this morning. But for that last piece of intelligence, I\r\nshould have been on my way back to Scotland before now. As it is, I\r\ncannot decide for myself what I ought to do next. My going back to\r\nDumfries, after Mr. Vanstone has left it, seems like taking a journey\r\nfor nothing \xe2\x80\x94and my staying in London appears to be almost equally\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you kindly advise me in this difficulty? I will come to you at\r\nLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn at any time this afternoon or to-morrow which you may\r\nappoint. My next few hours are engaged. As soon as this letter is\r\ndispatched, I am going to Kensington, with the object of ascertaining\r\nwhether certain doubts I feel about the means by which Mrs. Lecount may\r\nhave accomplished her discovery are well founded or not. If you will\r\nlet me have your answer by return of post, I will not fail to get back\r\nto St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Wood in time to receive it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear sir, yours sincerely,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAGDALEN VANSTONE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nFrom Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, November 5th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour letter and its inclosure have caused me great concern and\r\nsurprise. Pressure of business allows me no hope of being able to see\r\nyou either to-day or to-morrow morning. But if three o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow\r\nafternoon will suit you, at that hour you will find me at your service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot pretend to offer a positive opinion until I know more of the\r\nparticulars connected with this extraordinary business than I find\r\ncommunicated either in your letter or in your maid\xe2\x80\x99s. But with this\r\nreserve, I venture to suggest that your remaining in London until\r\nto-morrow may possibly lead to other results besides your consultation\r\nat my chambers. There is at least a chance that you or I may hear\r\nsomething further in this strange matter by the morning\xe2\x80\x99s post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remain, dear Madam, faithfully yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN LOSCOMBE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nFrom Mrs. Noel Vanstone to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 5th, Two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just returned from Westmoreland House\xe2\x80\x94after purposely leaving\r\nit in secret, and purposely avoiding you under your own roof. You shall\r\nknow why I came, and why I went away. It is due to my remembrance of\r\nold times not to treat you like a stranger, although I can never again\r\ntreat you like a friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI set forth on the third from the North to London. My only object in\r\ntaking this long journey was to see Norah. I had been suffering for\r\nmany weary weeks past such remorse as only miserable women like me can\r\nfeel. Perhaps the suffering weakened me; perhaps it roused some old\r\nforgotten tenderness\xe2\x80\x94God knows!\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it; I can only tell you\r\nthat I began to think of Norah by day, and to dream of Norah by night,\r\ntill I was almost heartbroken. I have no better reason than this to\r\ngive for running all the risks which I ran, and coming to London to see\r\nher. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to claim more for myself than I deserve; I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nto tell you I was the reformed and repenting creature whom _you_ might\r\nhave approved. I had only one feeling in me that I know of. I wanted to\r\nput my arms round Norah\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and cry my heart out on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s bosom.\r\nChildish enough, I dare say. Something might have come of it; nothing\r\nmight have come of it\xe2\x80\x94who knows?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no means of finding Norah without your assistance. However you\r\nmight disapprove of what I had done, I thought you would not refuse to\r\nhelp me to find my sister. When I lay down last night in my strange\r\nbed, I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98I will ask Miss Garth, for my father\xe2\x80\x99s sake and\r\nmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s sake, to tell me.\xe2\x80\x99 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a comfort I felt in\r\nthat thought. How should you? What do good women like you know of\r\nmiserable sinners like me? All you know is that you pray for us at\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I fell asleep happily that night\xe2\x80\x94for the first time since my\r\nmarriage. When the morning came, I paid the penalty of daring to be\r\nhappy only for one night. When the morning came, a letter came with it,\r\nwhich told me that my bitterest enemy on earth (you have meddled\r\nsufficiently with my affairs to know what enemy I mean) had revenged\r\nherself on me in my absence. In following the impulse which led me to\r\nmy sister, I had gone to my ruin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mischief was beyond all present remedy, when I received the news\r\nof it. Whatever had happened, whatever might happen, I made up my mind\r\nto persist in my resolution of seeing Norah before I did anything else.\r\nI suspected _you_ of being concerned in the disaster which had\r\novertaken me\xe2\x80\x94because I felt positively certain at Aldborough that you\r\nand Mrs. Lecount had written to each other. But I never suspected\r\nNorah. If I lay on my death-bed at this moment I could say with a safe\r\nconscience I never suspected Norah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I went this morning to Westmoreland House to ask you for my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s address, and to acknowledge plainly that I suspected you of\r\nbeing again in correspondence with Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I inquired for you at the door, they told me you had gone out,\r\nbut that you were expected back before long. They asked me if I would\r\nsee your sister, who was then in the school-room. I desired that your\r\nsister should on no account be disturbed: my business was not with her,\r\nbut with you. I begged to be allowed to wait in a room by myself until\r\nyou returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey showed me into the double room on the ground-floor, divided by\r\ncurtains\xe2\x80\x94as it was when I last remember it. There was a fire in the\r\nouter division of the room, but none in the inner; and for that reason,\r\nI suppose, the curtains were drawn. The servant was very civil and\r\nattentive to me. I have learned to be thankful for civility and\r\nattention, and I spoke to her as cheerfully as I could. I said to her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall see Miss Garth here, as she comes up to the door, and I can\r\nbeckon her in through the long window.\xe2\x80\x99 The servant said I could do so,\r\nif you came that way, but that you let yourself in sometimes with your\r\nown key by the back-garden gate; and if you did this, she would take\r\ncare to let you know of my visit. I mention these trifles, to show you\r\nthat there was no pre-meditated deceit in my mind when I came to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited a weary time, and you never came: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether my\r\nimpatience made me think so, or whether the large fire burning made the\r\nroom really as hot as I felt it to be\xe2\x80\x94I only know that, after a while,\r\nI passed through the curtains into the inner room, to try the cooler\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked to the long window which leads into the back garden, to look\r\nout, and almost at the same time I heard the door opened\xe2\x80\x94the door of\r\nthe room I had just left, and your voice and the voice of some other\r\nwoman, a stranger to me, talking. The stranger was one of the\r\nparlor-boarders, I dare say. I gathered from the first words you\r\nexchanged together, that you had met in the passage\xe2\x80\x94she on her way\r\ndownstairs, and you on your way in from the back garden. Her next\r\nquestion and your next answer informed me that this person was a friend\r\nof my sister\xe2\x80\x99s, who felt a strong interest in her, and who knew that\r\nyou had just returned from a visit to Norah. So far, I only hesitated\r\nto show myself, because I shrank, in my painful situation, from facing\r\na stranger. But when I heard my own name immediately afterward on your\r\nlips and on hers, then I purposely came nearer to the curtain between\r\nus, and purposely listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mean action, you will say? Call it mean, if you like. What better\r\ncan you expect from such a woman as I am?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were always famous for your memory. There is no necessity for my\r\nrepeating the words you spoke to your friend, and the words your friend\r\nspoke to you, hardly an hour since. When you read these lines, you will\r\nknow, as well as I know, what those words told me. I ask for no\r\nparticulars; I will take all your reasons and all your excuses for\r\ngranted. It is enough for me to know that you and Mr. Pendril have been\r\nsearching for me again, and that Norah is in the conspiracy this time,\r\nto reclaim me in spite of myself. It is enough for me to know that my\r\nletter to my sister has been turned into a trap to catch me, and that\r\nMrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s revenge has accomplished its object by means of\r\ninformation received from Norah\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what I suffered when I heard these things? No; it\r\nwould only be a waste of time to tell you. Whatever I suffer, I deserve\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited in that inner room\xe2\x80\x94knowing my own violent temper, and not\r\ntrusting myself to see you, after what I had heard\xe2\x80\x94I waited in that\r\ninner room, trembling lest the servant should tell you of my visit\r\nbefore I could find an opportunity of leaving the house. No such\r\nmisfortune happened. The servant, no doubt, heard the voices upstairs,\r\nand supposed that we had met each other in the passage. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow long or how short a time it was before you left the room to go and\r\ntake off your bonnet\xe2\x80\x94you went, and your friend went with you. I raised\r\nthe long window softly, and stepped into the back garden. The way by\r\nwhich you returned to the house was the way by which I left it. No\r\nblame attaches to the servant. As usual, where I am concerned, nobody\r\nis to blame but me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime enough has passed now to quiet my mind a little. You know how\r\nstrong I am? You remember how I used to fight against all my illnesses\r\nwhen I was a child? Now I am a woman, I fight against my miseries in\r\nthe same way. Don\xe2\x80\x99t pity me, Miss Garth! Don\xe2\x80\x99t pity me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no harsh feeling against Norah. The hope I had of seeing her is\r\na hope taken from me; the consolation I had in writing to her is a\r\nconsolation denied me for the future. I am cut to the heart; but I have\r\nno angry feeling toward my sister. She means well, poor soul\xe2\x80\x94I dare say\r\nshe means well. It would distress her, if she knew what has happened.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell her. Conceal my visit, and burn my letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA last word to yourself and I have done:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I rightly understand my present situation, your spies are still\r\nsearching for me to just as little purpose as they searched at York.\r\nDismiss them\xe2\x80\x94you are wasting your money to no purpose. If you\r\ndiscovered me to-morrow, what could you do? My position has altered. I\r\nam no longer the poor outcast girl, the vagabond public performer, whom\r\nyou once hunted after. I have done what I told you I would do\xe2\x80\x94I have\r\nmade the general sense of propriety my accomplice this time. Do you\r\nknow who I am? I am a respectable married woman, accountable for my\r\nactions to nobody under heaven but my husband. I have got a place in\r\nthe world, and a name in the world, at last. Even the law, which is the\r\nfriend of all you respectable people, has recognized my existence, and\r\nhas become _my_ friend too! The Archbishop of Canterbury gave me his\r\nlicense to be married, and the vicar of Aldborough performed the\r\nservice. If I found your spies following me in the street, and if I\r\nchose to claim protection from them, the law would acknowledge my\r\nclaim. You forget what wonders my wickedness has done for me. It has\r\nmade Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s Child Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s Wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will give these considerations their due weight; if you will\r\nexert your excellent common sense, I have no fear of being obliged to\r\nappeal to my newly-found friend and protector\xe2\x80\x94the law. You will feel,\r\nby this time, that you have meddled with me at last to some purpose. I\r\nam estranged from Norah\xe2\x80\x94I am discovered by my husband\xe2\x80\x94I am defeated by\r\nMrs. Lecount. You have driven me to the last extremity; you have\r\nstrengthened me to fight the battle of my life with the resolution\r\nwhich only a lost and friendless woman can feel. Badly as your schemes\r\nhave prospered, they have not proved totally useless after all!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more to say. If you ever speak about me to Norah, tell her\r\nthat a day may come when she will see me again\xe2\x80\x94the day when we two\r\nsisters have recovered our natural rights; the day when I put Norah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfortune into Norah\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are my last words. Remember them the next time you feel tempted\r\nto meddle with me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAGDALEN VANSTONE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nFrom Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, November 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning\xe2\x80\x99s post has doubtless brought you the same shocking news\r\nwhich it has brought to me. You must know by this time that a terrible\r\naffliction has befallen you\xe2\x80\x94the affliction of your husband\xe2\x80\x99s sudden\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am on the point of starting for the North, to make all needful\r\ninquiries, and to perform whatever duties I may with propriety\r\nundertake, as solicitor to the deceased gentleman. Let me earnestly\r\nrecommend you not to follow me to Baliol Cottage, until I have had time\r\nto write to you first, and to give you such advice as I cannot, through\r\nignorance of all the circumstances, pretend to offer now. You may rely\r\non my writing, after my arrival in Scotland, by the first post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remain, dear Madam, faithfully yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN LOSCOMBE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nFrom Mr. Pendril to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerle Street, November 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI return you Mrs. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s letter. I can understand your\r\nmortification at the tone in which it is written, and your distress at\r\nthe manner in which this unhappy woman has interpreted the conversation\r\nthat she overheard at your house. I cannot honestly add that I lament\r\nwhat has happened. My opinion has never altered since the Combe-Raven\r\ntime. I believe Mrs. Noel Vanstone to be one of the most reckless,\r\ndesperate, and perverted women living; and any circumstances that\r\nestrange her from her sister are circumstances which I welcome, for her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere cannot be a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt on the course you ought to follow in\r\nthis matter. Even Mrs. Noel Vanstone herself acknowledges the propriety\r\nof sparing her sister additional and unnecessary distress. By all\r\nmeans, keep Miss Vanstone in ignorance of the visit to Kensington, and\r\nof the letter which has followed it. It would be not only unwise, but\r\nabsolutely cruel, to enlighten her. If we had any remedy to apply, or\r\neven any hope to offer, we might feel some hesitation in keeping our\r\nsecret. But there is no remedy, and no hope. Mrs. Noel Vanstone is\r\nperfectly justified in the view she takes of her own position. Neither\r\nyou nor I can assert the smallest right to control her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already taken the necessary measures for putting an end to our\r\nuseless inquiries. In a few days I will write to Miss Vanstone, and\r\nwill do my best to tranquilize her mind on the subject of her sister.\r\nIf I can find no sufficient excuse to satisfy her, it will be better\r\nshe should think we have discovered nothing than that she should know\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me most truly yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWILLIAM PENDRIL.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nFrom Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, November 15th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn compliance with your request, I now proceed to communicate to you\r\nin writing what (but for the calamity which has so recently befallen\r\nyou) I should have preferred communicating by word of mouth. Be pleased\r\nto consider this letter as strictly confidential between yourself and\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI enclose, as you desire, a copy of the Will executed by your late\r\nhusband on the third of this month. There can be no question of the\r\ngenuineness of the original document. I protested, as a matter of form,\r\nagainst Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor assuming a position of authority at\r\nBaliol Cottage. But he took the position, nevertheless; acting as legal\r\nrepresentative of the sole Executor under the second Will. I am bound\r\nto say I should have done the same myself in his place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe serious question follows, What can we do for the best in your\r\ninterests? The Will executed under my professional superintendence, on\r\nthe thirtieth of September last, is at present superseded and revoked\r\nby the second and later Will, executed on the third of November. Can we\r\ndispute this document?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt the possibility of disputing the new Will on the face of it.\r\nIt is no doubt irregularly expressed; but it is dated, signed, and\r\nwitnessed as the law directs; and the perfectly simple and\r\nstraightforward provisions that it contains are in no respect, that I\r\ncan see, technically open to attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis being the case, can we dispute the Will on the ground that it has\r\nbeen executed when the Testator was not in a fit state to dispose of\r\nhis own property? or when the Testator was subjected to undue and\r\nimproper influence?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first of these cases, the medical evidence would put an\r\nobstacle in our way. We cannot assert that previous illness had\r\nweakened the Testator\xe2\x80\x99s mind. It is clear that he died suddenly, as the\r\ndoctors had all along declared he would die, of disease of the heart.\r\nHe was out walking in his garden, as usual, on the day of his death; he\r\nate a hearty dinner; none of the persons in his service noticed any\r\nchange in him; he was a little more irritable with them than usual, but\r\nthat was all. It is impossible to attack the state of his faculties:\r\nthere is no case to go into court with, so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we declare that he acted under undue influence; or, in plainer\r\nterms, under the influence of Mrs. Lecount?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are serious difficulties, again, in the way of taking this\r\ncourse. We cannot assert, for example, that Mrs. Lecount has assumed a\r\nplace in the will which she has no fair claim to occupy. She has\r\ncunningly limited her own legacy, not only to what is fairly due her,\r\nbut to what the late Mr. Michael Vanstone himself had the intention of\r\nleaving her. If I were examined on the subject, I should be compelled\r\nto acknowledge that I had heard him express this intention myself. It\r\nis only the truth to say that I have heard him express it more than\r\nonce. There is no point of attack in Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, and there\r\nis no point of attack in your late husband\xe2\x80\x99s choice of an executor. He\r\nhas made the wise choice, and the natural choice, of the oldest and\r\ntrustiest friend he had in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more consideration remains\xe2\x80\x94the most important which I have yet\r\napproached, and therefore the consideration which I have reserved to\r\nthe last. On the thirtieth of September, the Testator executes a will,\r\nleaving his widow sole executrix, with a legacy of eighty thousand\r\npounds. On the third of November following, he expressly revokes this\r\nwill, and leaves another in its stead, in which his widow is never once\r\nmentioned, and in which the whole residue of his estate, after payment\r\nof one comparatively trifling legacy, is left to a friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt rests entirely with you to say whether any valid reason can or\r\ncannot be produced to explain such an extraordinary proceeding as this.\r\nIf no reason can be assigned\xe2\x80\x94and I know of none myself\xe2\x80\x94I think we have\r\na point here which deserves our careful consideration; for it may be a\r\npoint which is open to attack. Pray understand that I am now appealing\r\nto you solely as a lawyer, who is obliged to look all possible\r\neventualities in the face. I have no wish to intrude on your private\r\naffairs; I have no wish to write a word which could be construed into\r\nany indirect reflection on yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you tell me that, so far as you know, your husband capriciously\r\nstruck you out of his will, without assignable reason or motive for\r\ndoing so, and without other obvious explanation of his conduct than\r\nthat he acted in this matter entirely under the influence of Mrs.\r\nLecount, I will immediately take Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s opinion touching the\r\npropriety of disputing the will on this ground. If, on the other hand,\r\nyou tell me that there are reasons (known to yourself, though unknown\r\nto me) for not taking the course I propose, I will accept that\r\nintimation without troubling you, unless you wish it, to explain\r\nyourself further. In this latter event, I will write to you again; for\r\nI shall then have something more to say, which may greatly surprise\r\nyou, on the subject of the Will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaithfully yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN LOSCOMBE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nFrom Mrs. Noel Vanstone to Mr. Loscombe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 16th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept my best thanks for the kindness and consideration with which\r\nyou have treated me; and let the anxieties under which I am now\r\nsuffering plead my excuse, if I reply to your letter without ceremony,\r\nin the fewest possible words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my own reasons for not hesitating to answer your question in\r\nthe negative. It is impossible for us to go to law, as you propose, on\r\nthe subject of the Will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear sir, yours gratefully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAGDALEN VANSTONE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nFrom Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. November 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, answering my proposal\r\nin the negative, for reasons of your own. Under these circumstances\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nwhich I offer no comment\xe2\x80\x94I beg to perform my promise of again\r\ncommunicating with you on the subject of your late husband\xe2\x80\x99s Will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so kind as to look at your copy of the document. You will find that\r\nthe clause which devises the whole residue of your husband\xe2\x80\x99s estate to\r\nAdmiral Bartram ends in these terms: _to be by him applied to such uses\r\nas he may think fit._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimple as they may seem to you, these are very remarkable words. In\r\nthe first place, no practical lawyer would have used them in drawing\r\nyour husband\xe2\x80\x99s will. In the second place, they are utterly useless to\r\nserve any plain straightforward purpose. The legacy is left\r\nunconditionally to the admiral; and in the same breath he is told that\r\nhe may do what he likes with it! The phrase points clearly to one of\r\ntwo conclusions. It has either dropped from the writer\xe2\x80\x99s pen in pure\r\nignorance, or it has been carefully set where it appears to serve the\r\npurpose of a snare. I am firmly persuaded that the latter explanation\r\nis the right one. The words are expressly intended to mislead some\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x94yourself in all probability\xe2\x80\x94and the cunning which has put them\r\nto that use is a cunning which (as constantly happens when uninstructed\r\npersons meddle with law) has overreached itself. My thirty years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexperience reads those words in a sense exactly opposite to the sense\r\nwhich they are intended to convey. I say that Admiral Bartram is _not_\r\nfree to apply his legacy to such purposes as he may think fit; I\r\nbelieve he is privately controlled by a supplementary document in the\r\nshape of a Secret Trust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can easily explain to you what I mean by a Secret Trust. It is\r\nusually contained in the form of a letter from a Testator to his\r\nExecutors, privately informing them of testamentary intentions on his\r\npart which he has not thought proper openly to acknowledge in his will.\r\nI leave you a hundred pounds; and I write a private letter enjoining\r\nyou, on taking the legacy, not to devote it to your own purposes, but\r\nto give it to some third person, whose name I have my own reasons for\r\nnot mentioning in my will. That is a Secret Trust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am right in my own persuasion that such a document as I here\r\ndescribe is at this moment in Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s possession\xe2\x80\x94a persuasion\r\nbased, in the first instance, on the extraordinary words that I have\r\nquoted to you; and, in the second instance, on purely legal\r\nconsiderations with which it is needless to incumber my letter\xe2\x80\x94if I am\r\nright in this opinion, the discovery of the Secret Trust would be, in\r\nall probability, a most important discovery to your interests. I will\r\nnot trouble you with technical reasons, or with references to my\r\nexperience in these matters, which only a professional man could\r\nunderstand. I will merely say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t give up your cause as\r\nutterly lost, until the conviction now impressed on my own mind is\r\nproved to be wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can add no more, while this important question still remains\r\ninvolved in doubt; neither can I suggest any means of solving that\r\ndoubt. If the existence of the Trust was proved, and if the nature of\r\nthe stipulations contained in it was made known to me, I could then say\r\npositively what the legal chances were of your being able to set up a\r\nCase on the strength of it: and I could also tell you whether I should\r\nor should not feel justified in personally undertaking that Case under\r\na private arrangement with yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs things are, I can make no arrangement, and offer no advice. I can\r\nonly put you confidentially in possession of my private opinion,\r\nleaving you entirely free to draw your own inferences from it, and\r\nregretting that I cannot write more confidently and more definitely\r\nthan I have written here. All that I could conscientiously say on this\r\nvery difficult and delicate subject, I have said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear madam, faithfully yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN LOSCOMBE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.\xe2\x80\x94I omitted one consideration in my last letter, which I may\r\nmention here, in order to show you that no point in connection with the\r\ncase has escaped me. If it had been possible to show that Mr. Vanstone\r\nwas _domiciled_ in Scotland at the time of his death, we might have\r\nasserted your interests by means of the Scotch law, which does not\r\nallow a husband the power of absolutely disinheriting his wife. But it\r\nis impossible to assert that Mr. Vanstone was legally domiciled in\r\nScotland. He came there as a visitor only; he occupied a furnished\r\nhouse for the season; and he never expressed, either by word or deed,\r\nthe slightest intention of settling permanently in the North.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nFrom Mrs. Noel Vanstone to Mr. Loscombe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have read your letter more than once, with the deepest interest and\r\nattention; and the oftener I read it, the more firmly I believe that\r\nthere is really such a Letter as you mention in Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my interest that the discovery should be made, and I at once\r\nacknowledge to you that I am determined to find the means of secretly\r\nand certainly making it. My resolution rests on other motives than the\r\nmotives which you might naturally suppose would influence me. I only\r\ntell you this, in case you feel inclined to remonstrate. There is good\r\nreason for what I say, when I assure you that remonstrance will be\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask for no assistance in this matter; I will trouble nobody for\r\nadvice. You shall not be involved in any rash proceedings on my part.\r\nWhatever danger there may be, I will risk it. Whatever delays may\r\nhappen, I will bear them patiently. I am lonely and friendless, and\r\nsurely troubled in mind, but I am strong enough to win my way through\r\nworse trials than these. My spirits will rise again, and my time will\r\ncome. If that Secret Trust is in Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s possession\xe2\x80\x94when you\r\nnext see me, you shall see me with it in my own hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours gratefully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAGDALEN VANSTONE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH SCENE.\r\nST. JOHN\xe2\x80\x99S WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIt wanted little more than a fortnight to Christmas; but the weather\r\nshowed no signs yet of the frost and snow, conventionally associated\r\nwith the coming season. The atmosphere was unnaturally warm, and the\r\nold year was dying feebly in sapping rain and enervating mist.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the December afternoon, Magdalen sat alone in the\r\nlodging which she had occupied since her arrival in London. The fire\r\nburned sluggishly in the narrow little grate; the view of the wet\r\nhouses and soaking gardens opposite was darkening fast; and the bell of\r\nthe suburban muffin-boy tinkled in the distance drearily. Sitting close\r\nover the fire, with a little money lying loose in her lap, Magdalen\r\nabsently shifted the coins to and fro on the smooth surface of her\r\ndress, incessantly altering their positions toward each other, as if\r\nthey were pieces of a \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x99s puzzle\xe2\x80\x9d which she was trying to put\r\ntogether. The dim fire-light flaming up on her faintly from time to\r\ntime showed changes which would have told their own tale sadly to\r\nfriends of former days. Her dress had become loose through the wasting\r\nof her figure; but she had not cared to alter it. The old restlessness\r\nin her movements, the old mobility in her expression, appeared no more.\r\nHer face passively maintained its haggard composure, its changeless\r\nunnatural calm. Mr. Pendril might have softened his hard sentence on\r\nher, if he had seen her now; and Mrs. Lecount, in the plenitude of her\r\ntriumph, might have pitied her fallen enemy at last.\r\n\r\nHardly four months had passed since the wedding-day at Aldborough, and\r\nthe penalty for that day was paid already\xe2\x80\x94paid in unavailing remorse,\r\nin hopeless isolation, in irremediable defeat! Let this be said for\r\nher; let the truth which has been told of the fault be told of the\r\nexpiation as well. Let it be recorded of her that she enjoyed no secret\r\ntriumph on the day of her success. The horror of herself with which her\r\nown act had inspired her, had risen to its climax when the design of\r\nher marriage was achieved. She had never suffered in secret as she\r\nsuffered when the Combe-Raven money was left to her in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill. She had never felt the means taken to accomplish her end so\r\nunutterably degrading to herself, as she felt them on the day when the\r\nend was reached. Out of that feeling had grown the remorse which had\r\nhurried her to seek pardon and consolation in her sister\xe2\x80\x99s love. Never\r\nsince it had first entered her heart, never since she had first felt it\r\nsacred to her at her father\xe2\x80\x99s grave, had the Purpose to which she had\r\nvowed herself, so nearly lost its hold on her as at this time. Never\r\nmight Norah\xe2\x80\x99s influence have achieved such good as on the day when that\r\ninfluence was lost\xe2\x80\x94the day when the fatal words were overheard at Miss\r\nGarth\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94the day when the fatal letter from Scotland told of Mrs.\r\nLecount\xe2\x80\x99s revenge.\r\n\r\nThe harm was done; the chance was gone. Time and Hope alike had both\r\npassed her by.\r\n\r\nFaintly and more faintly the inner voices now pleaded with her to pause\r\non the downward way. The discovery which had poisoned her heart with\r\nits first distrust of her sister; the tidings which had followed it of\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s death; the sting of Mrs. Lecount\xe2\x80\x99s triumph, felt through\r\nall, had done their work. The remorse which had embittered her married\r\nlife was deadened now to a dull despair. It was too late to make the\r\natonement of confession\xe2\x80\x94too late to lay bare to the miserable husband\r\nthe deeper secrets that had once lurked in the heart of the miserable\r\nwife. Innocent of all thought of the hideous treachery which Mrs.\r\nLecount had imputed to her\xe2\x80\x94she was guilty of knowing how his health was\r\nbroken when she married him; guilty of knowing, when he left her the\r\nCombe-Raven money, that the accident of a moment, harmless to other\r\nmen, might place his life in jeopardy, and effect her release. His\r\ndeath had told her this\xe2\x80\x94had told her plainly what she had shrunk, in\r\nhis lifetime, from openly acknowledging to herself. From the dull\r\ntorment of that reproach; from the dreary wretchedness of doubting\r\neverybody, even to Norah herself; from the bitter sense of her defeated\r\nschemes; from the blank solitude of her friendless life\xe2\x80\x94what refuge was\r\nleft? But one refuge now. She turned to the relentless Purpose which\r\nwas hurrying her to her ruin, and cried to it with the daring of her\r\ndespair\xe2\x80\x94Drive me on!\r\n\r\nFor days and days together she had bent her mind on the one object\r\nwhich occupied it since she had received the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter. For days\r\nand days together she had toiled to meet the first necessity of her\r\nposition\xe2\x80\x94to find a means of discovering the Secret Trust. There was no\r\nhope, this time, of assistance from Captain Wragge. Long practice had\r\nmade the old militia-man an adept in the art of vanishing. The plow of\r\nthe moral agriculturist left no furrows\xe2\x80\x94not a trace of him was to be\r\nfound! Mr. Loscombe was too cautious to commit himself to an active\r\ncourse of any kind; he passively maintained his opinions and left the\r\nrest to his client\xe2\x80\x94-he desired to know nothing until the Trust was\r\nplaced in his hands. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s interests were now in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nsole care. Risk or no risk, what she did next she must do by herself.\r\n\r\nThe prospect had not daunted her. Alone she had calculated the chances\r\nthat might be tried. Alone she was now determined to make the attempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, as she sat over the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust sound Louisa first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe collected the scattered coins in her lap, and placed them in a\r\nlittle heap on the table, then rose and rang the bell. The landlady\r\nanswered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my servant downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. She is having her tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she has done, say I want her up here. Wait a moment. You will\r\nfind your money on the table\xe2\x80\x94the money I owe you for last week. Can you\r\nfind it? or would you like to have a candle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather dark, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen lit a candle. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat notice must I give you,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as she\r\nput the candle on the table, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA week is the usual notice, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. I hope you have no objection to\r\nmake to the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever. I only ask the question, because I may be obliged to\r\nleave these lodgings rather sooner than I anticipated. Is the money\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Here is your receipt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to send Louisa to me as soon as she has done\r\nher tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady withdrew. As soon as she was alone again, Magdalen\r\nextinguished the candle, and drew an empty chair close to her own chair\r\non the hearth. This done, she resumed her former place, and waited\r\nuntil Louisa appeared. There was doubt in her face as she sat looking\r\nmechanically into the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cA poor chance,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut, poor as it is, a chance that I must try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes more, Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s meek knock was softly audible outside.\r\nShe was surprised, on entering the room, to find no other light in it\r\nthan the light of the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have the candles, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will have candles if you wish for them yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnot otherwise. I have something to say to you. When I have said it,\r\nyou shall decide whether we sit together in the dark or in the light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa waited near the door, and listened to those strange words in\r\nsilent astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, pointing to the empty chair; \xe2\x80\x9ccome here and\r\nsit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa advanced, and timidly removed the chair from its position at her\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s side. Magdalen instantly drew it back again. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome closer\xe2\x80\x94come close by me.\xe2\x80\x9d After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, Louisa\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask you to sit near me,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I wish to speak\r\nto you on equal terms. Whatever distinctions there might once have been\r\nbetween us are now at an end. I am a lonely woman thrown helpless on my\r\nown resources, without rank or place in the world. I may or may not\r\nkeep you as my friend. As mistress and maid the connection between us\r\nmust come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Louisa, faintly.\r\n\r\nMagdalen sorrowfully and steadily went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you first came to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I should not like\r\nyou. I have learned to like you\xe2\x80\x94I have learned to be grateful to you.\r\nFrom first to last you have been faithful and good to me. The least I\r\ncan do in return is not to stand in the way of your future prospects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t send me away, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa, imploringly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can only\r\nhelp me with a little money now and then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for my wages\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwill, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen took her hand and went on, as sorrowfully and as steadily as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy future life is all darkness, all uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next\r\nstep I may take may lead me to my prosperity or may lead me to my ruin.\r\nCan I ask you to share such a prospect as this? If your future was as\r\nuncertain as mine is\xe2\x80\x94if you, too, were a friendless woman thrown on the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94my conscience might be easy in letting you cast your lot with\r\nmine. I might accept your attachment, for I might feel I was not\r\nwronging you. How can I feel this in your case? You have a future to\r\nlook to. You are an excellent servant; you can get another place\xe2\x80\x94a far\r\nbetter place than mine. You can refer to me; and if the character I\r\ngive is not considered sufficient, you can refer to the mistress you\r\nserved before me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the instant when that reference to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s last employer escaped\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s lips, Louisa snatched her hand away and started up\r\naffrightedly from her chair. There was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence. Both\r\nmistress and maid were equally taken by surprise.\r\n\r\nMagdalen was the first to recover herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it getting too dark?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to\r\nlight the candles, after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa drew back into the dimmest corner of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou suspect me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered out of the darkness, in a\r\nbreathless whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cWho has told you? How did you find out\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstopped, and burst into tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI deserve your suspicion,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nstruggling to compose herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it to _you_. You have\r\ntreated me so kindly; you have made me so fond of you! Forgive me, Mrs.\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x94I am a wretch; I have deceived you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here and sit down by me again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\xe2\x80\x94or I will\r\nget up myself and bring you back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa slowly returned to her place. Dim as the fire-light was, she\r\nseemed to fear it. She held her handkerchief over her face, and shrank\r\nfrom her mistress as she seated herself again in the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong in thinking that any one has betrayed you to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMagdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that I know of you is, what your own looks and ways have\r\ntold me. You have had some secret trouble weighing on your mind ever\r\nsince you have been in my service. I confess I have spoken with the\r\nwish to find out more of you and your past life than I have found out\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94not because I am curious, but because I have my secret troubles\r\ntoo. Are you an unhappy woman, like me? If you are, I will take you\r\ninto my confidence. If you have nothing to tell me\xe2\x80\x94if you choose to\r\nkeep your secret\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you; I only say, Let us part. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask how you have deceived me. I will only remember that you have been\r\nan honest and faithful and competent servant while I have employed you;\r\nand I will say as much in your favor to any new mistress you like to\r\nsend to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited for the reply. For a moment, and only for a moment, Louisa\r\nhesitated. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s nature was weak, but not depraved. She was\r\nhonestly attached to her mistress; and she spoke with a courage which\r\nMagdalen had not expected from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you send me away, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t take my character from\r\nyou till I have told you the truth; I won\xe2\x80\x99t return your kindness by\r\ndeceiving you a second time. Did my master ever tell you how he engaged\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I never asked him, and he never told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe engaged me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, with a written character\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe character was a false one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen drew back in amazement. The confession she heard was not the\r\nconfession she had anticipated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your mistress refuse to give you a character?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa dropped on her knees and hid her face in her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s lap.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a miserable, degraded creature; I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nfit to be in the same room with you!\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalen bent over her, and\r\nwhispered a question in her ear. Louisa whispered back the one sad word\r\nof reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he deserted you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, after waiting a moment, and\r\nthinking first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of her own loveless marriage stung Magdalen to the\r\nquick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t kneel to _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthere is a degraded woman in this room, I am the woman\xe2\x80\x94not you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised the girl by main force from her knees, and put her back in\r\nthe chair. They both waited a little in silence. Keeping her hand on\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, Magdalen seated herself again, and looked with\r\nunutterable bitterness of sorrow into the dying fire. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happy women there are in the world! Wives who love their\r\nhusbands! Mothers who are not ashamed to own their children! Are you\r\nquieter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, gently addressing Louisa once more. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you\r\nanswer me, if I ask you something else? Where is the child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child is out at nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the father help to support it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does all he can, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he? Is he in service? Is he in a trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father is a master-carpenter\xe2\x80\x94he works in his father\xe2\x80\x99s yard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he has got work, why has he not married you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is his father\xe2\x80\x99s fault, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94not his. His father has no pity on us.\r\nHe would be turned out of house and home if he married me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan he get no work elsewhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get good work in London, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. There are so many in\r\nLondon\xe2\x80\x94they take the bread out of each other\xe2\x80\x99s mouths. If we had only\r\nhad the money to emigrate, he would have married me long since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould he marry you if you had the money now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure he would, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. He could get plenty of work in Australia,\r\nand double and treble the wages he gets here. He is trying hard, and I\r\nam trying hard, to save a little toward it\xe2\x80\x94I put by all I can spare\r\nfrom my child. But it is so little! If we live for years to come, there\r\nseems no hope for us. I know I have done wrong every way\xe2\x80\x94I know I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeserve to be happy. But how could I let my child suffer?\xe2\x80\x94I was obliged\r\nto go to service. My mistress was hard on me, and my health broke down\r\nin trying to live by my needle. I would never have deceived anybody by\r\na false character, if there had been another chance for me. I was alone\r\nand helpless, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; and I can only ask you to forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk better women than I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only fit to\r\nfeel for you, and I do feel for you with all my heart. In your place I\r\nshould have gone into service with a false character, too. Say no more\r\nof the past\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you hurt me in speaking of it. Talk of\r\nthe future. I think I can help you, and do you no harm. I think you can\r\nhelp me, and do me the greatest of all services in return. Wait, and\r\nyou shall hear what I mean. Suppose you were married\xe2\x80\x94how much would it\r\ncost for you and your husband to emigrate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa mentioned the cost of a steerage passage to Australia for a man\r\nand his wife. She spoke in low, hopeless tones. Moderate as the sum\r\nwas, it looked like unattainable wealth in her eyes.\r\n\r\nMagdalen started in her chair, and took the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, earnestly; \xe2\x80\x9cif I gave you the money, what would you\r\ndo for me in return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proposal seemed to strike Louisa speechless with astonishment. She\r\ntrembled violently, and said nothing. Magdalen repeated her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, do you mean it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really mean it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cI really mean it. What would you do for me in\r\nreturn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Louisa. \xe2\x80\x9cOh what is there I would _not_ do!\xe2\x80\x9d She tried\r\nto kiss her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s hand; but Magdalen would not permit it. She\r\nresolutely, almost roughly, drew her hand away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am laying you under no obligation,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are serving each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94that is all. Sit quiet, and let me think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the next ten minutes there was silence in the room. At the end of\r\nthat time Magdalen took out her watch and held it close to the grate.\r\nThere was just firelight enough to show her the hour. It was close on\r\nsix o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you composed enough to go downstairs and deliver a message?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, rising from her chair as she spoke to Louisa again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nvery simple message\xe2\x80\x94it is only to tell the boy that I want a cab as\r\nsoon as he can get me one. I must go out immediately. You shall know\r\nwhy later in the evening. I have much more to say to you; but there is\r\nno time to say it now. When I am gone, bring your work up here, and\r\nwait for my return. I shall be back before bed-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout another word of explanation, she hurriedly lit a candle and\r\nwithdrew into the bedroom to put on her bonnet and shawl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBetween nine and ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the same evening, Louisa, waiting\r\nanxiously, heard the long-expected knock at the house door. She ran\r\ndownstairs at once and let her mistress in.\r\n\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s face was flushed. She showed far more agitation on returning\r\nto the house than she had shown on leaving it. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your place at the\r\ntable,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Louisa, impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cbut lay aside your work. I\r\nwant you to attend carefully to what I am going to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa obeyed. Magdalen seated herself at the opposite side of the\r\ntable, and moved the candles, so as to obtain a clear and uninterrupted\r\nview of her servant\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you noticed a respectable elderly woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, abruptly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho has been here once or twice in the last fortnight to pay me a\r\nvisit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; I think I let her in the second time she came. An elderly\r\nperson named Mrs. Attwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the person I mean. Mrs. Attwood is Mr. Loscombe\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper;\r\nnot the housekeeper at his private residence, but the housekeeper at\r\nhis offices in Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. I promised to go and drink tea with her\r\nsome evening this week, and I have been to-night. It is strange of me,\r\nis it not, to be on these familiar terms with a woman in Mrs. Attwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsituation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa made no answer in words. Her face spoke for her: she could\r\nhardly avoid thinking it strange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a motive for making friends with Mrs. Attwood,\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalen went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a widow, with a large family of daughters. Her daughters\r\nare all in service. One of them is an under-housemaid in the service of\r\nAdmiral Bartram, at St. Crux-in-the-Marsh. I found that out from Mrs.\r\nAttwood\xe2\x80\x99s master; and as soon as I arrived at the discovery, I\r\nprivately determined to make Mrs. Attwood\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance. Stranger\r\nstill, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa began to look a little uneasy. Her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s manner was at\r\nvariance with her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s words\xe2\x80\x94it was plainly suggestive of\r\nsomething startling to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat attraction Mrs. Attwood finds in my society,\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalen continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot presume to say. I can only tell you she has seen better days;\r\nshe is an educated person; and she may like my society on that account.\r\nAt any rate, she has readily met my advances toward her. What\r\nattraction I find in this good woman, on my side, is soon told. I have\r\na great curiosity\xe2\x80\x94an unaccountable curiosity, you will think\xe2\x80\x94about the\r\npresent course of household affairs at St. Crux-in-the-Marsh. Mrs.\r\nAttwood\xe2\x80\x99s daughter is a good girl, and constantly writes to her mother.\r\nHer mother is proud of the letters and proud of the girl, and is ready\r\nenough to talk about her daughter and her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s place. That is\r\nMrs. Attwood\xe2\x80\x99s attraction to _me._ You understand, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes\xe2\x80\x94Louisa understood. Magdalen went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to Mrs. Attwood and\r\nMrs. Attwood\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know some curious particulars\r\nalready of the household at St. Crux. Servants\xe2\x80\x99 tongues and servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nletters\xe2\x80\x94as I need not tell _you_\xe2\x80\x94are oftener occupied with their\r\nmasters and mistresses than their masters and mistresses suppose. The\r\nonly mistress at St. Crux is the housekeeper. But there is a\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x94Admiral Bartram. He appears to be a strange old man, whose whims\r\nand fancies amuse his servants as well as his friends. One of his\r\nfancies (the only one we need trouble ourselves to notice) is, that he\r\nhad men enough about him when he was living at sea, and that now he is\r\nliving on shore, he will be waited on by women-servants alone. The one\r\nman in the house is an old sailor, who has been all his life with his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x94he is a kind of pensioner at St. Crux, and has little or nothing\r\nto do with the housework. The other servants, indoors, are all women;\r\nand instead of a footman to wait on him at dinner, the admiral has a\r\nparlor-maid. The parlor-maid now at St. Crux is engaged to be married,\r\nand as soon as her master can suit himself she is going away. These\r\ndiscoveries I made some days since. But when I saw Mrs. Attwood\r\nto-night, she had received another letter from her daughter in the\r\ninterval, and that letter has helped me to find out something more. The\r\nhousekeeper is at her wits\xe2\x80\x99 end to find a new servant. Her master\r\ninsists on youth and good looks\xe2\x80\x94he leaves everything else to the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x94but he will have that. All the inquiries made in the\r\nneighborhood have failed to produce the sort of parlor-maid whom the\r\nadmiral wants. If nothing can be done in the next fortnight or three\r\nweeks, the housekeeper will advertise in the _Times_, and will come to\r\nLondon herself to see the applicants, and to make strict personal\r\ninquiry into their characters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa looked at her mistress more attentively than ever. The\r\nexpression of perplexity left her face, and a shade of disappointment\r\nappeared there in its stead. \xe2\x80\x9cBear in mind what I have said,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nMagdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cand wait a minute more, while I ask you some questions.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t think you understand me yet\xe2\x80\x94I can assure you, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand me. Have you always lived in service as lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever lived as parlor-maid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly in one place, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and not for long there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you lived long enough to learn your duties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were your duties besides waiting at table?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to show visitors in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and what else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the plate and the glass to look after; and the table-linen was\r\nall under my care. I had to answer all the bells, except in the\r\nbedrooms. There were other little odds and ends sometimes to do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your regular duties were the duties you have just mentioned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long ago is it since you lived in service as a parlor-maid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little better than two years, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have not forgotten how to wait at table, and clean\r\nplate, and the rest of it, in that time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this question Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s attention, which had been wandering more and\r\nmore during the progress of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries, wandered away\r\naltogether. Her gathering anxieties got the better of her discretion,\r\nand even of her timidity. Instead of answering her mistress, she\r\nsuddenly and confusedly ventured on a question of her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you mean me to offer for the\r\nparlor-maid\xe2\x80\x99s place at St. Crux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not! Have you forgotten what I said\r\nto you in this room before I went out? I mean you to be married, and go\r\nto Australia with your husband and your child. You have not waited as I\r\ntold you, to hear me explain myself. You have drawn your own\r\nconclusions, and you have drawn them wrong. I asked a question just\r\nnow, which you have not answered\xe2\x80\x94I asked if you had forgotten your\r\nparlor-maid\xe2\x80\x99s duties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d Louisa had replied rather unwillingly thus far. She\r\nanswered readily and confidently now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you teach the duties to another servant?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94easily, if she was quick and attentive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you teach the duties to Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa started, and changed color. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, half in\r\nincredulity, half in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cCould you qualify me to take the parlor-maid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace at St. Crux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlain as those words were, the bewilderment which they produced in\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x99s mind seemed to render her incapable of comprehending her\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s proposal. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, vacantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall perhaps help you to understand this extraordinary project of\r\nmine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cif I tell you plainly what the object of it is.\r\nDo you remember what I said to you about Mr. Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s will when you\r\ncame here from Scotland to join me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. You told me you had been left out of the will altogether.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure my fellow-servant would never have been one of the witnesses\r\nif she had known\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame your fellow-servant\xe2\x80\x94I blame nobody\r\nbut Mrs. Lecount. Let me go on with what I was saying. It is not at all\r\ncertain that Mrs. Lecount can do me the mischief which Mrs. Lecount\r\nintended. There is a chance that my lawyer, Mr. Loscombe, may be able\r\nto gain me what is fairly my due, in spite of the will. The chance\r\nturns on my discovering a letter which Mr. Loscombe believes, and which\r\nI believe, to be kept privately in Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s possession. I have\r\nnot the least hope of getting at that letter if I make the attempt in\r\nmy own person. Mrs. Lecount has poisoned the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s mind against me,\r\nand Mr. Vanstone has given him a secret to keep from me. If I wrote to\r\nhim, he would not answer my letter. If I went to his house, the door\r\nwould be closed in my face. I must find my way into St. Crux as a\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x94I must be in a position to look about the house, unsuspected\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmust be there with plenty of time on my hands. All the circumstances\r\nare in my favor, if I am received into the house as a servant; and as a\r\nservant I mean to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are a lady, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Louisa, in the greatest\r\nperplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cThe servants at St. Crux would find you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all afraid of their finding me out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow how to disguise myself in other people\xe2\x80\x99s characters more cleverly\r\nthan you suppose. Leave me to face the chances of discovery\xe2\x80\x94that is my\r\nrisk. Let us talk of nothing now but what concerns _you._ Don\xe2\x80\x99t decide\r\nyet whether you will, or will not, give me the help I want. Wait, and\r\nhear first what the help is. You are quick and clever at your needle.\r\nCan you make me the sort of gown which it is proper for a servant to\r\nwear\xe2\x80\x94and can you alter one of my best silk dresses so as to make it fit\r\nyourself \xe2\x80\x94in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I could get them done in a week, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. But why am I to wear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, and you will see. I shall give the landlady her week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotice to-morrow. In the interval, while you are making the dresses, I\r\ncan be learning the parlor-maid\xe2\x80\x99s duties. When the house-servant here\r\nhas brought up the dinner, and when you and I are alone in the\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94instead of your waiting on me, as usual, I will wait on you. (I am\r\nquite serious; don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me!) Whatever I can learn besides,\r\nwithout hindering you, I will practice carefully at every opportunity.\r\nWhen the week is over, and the dresses are done, we will leave this\r\nplace, and go into other lodgings\xe2\x80\x94you as the mistress and I as the\r\nmaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be found out, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Louisa, trembling at the\r\nprospect before her. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what a lady is?\r\nA lady is a woman who wears a silk gown, and has a sense of her own\r\nimportance. I shall put the gown on your back, and the sense in your\r\nhead. You speak good English; you are naturally quiet and\r\nself-restrained; if you can only conquer your timidity, I have not the\r\nleast fear of you. There will be time enough in the new lodging for you\r\nto practice your character, and for me to practice mine. There will be\r\ntime enough to make some more dresses\xe2\x80\x94another gown for me, and your\r\nwedding-dress (which I mean to give you) for yourself. I shall have the\r\nnewspaper sent every day. When the advertisement appears, I shall\r\nanswer it\xe2\x80\x94in any name I can take on the spur of the moment; in your\r\nname, if you like to lend it to me; and when the housekeeper asks me\r\nfor my character, I shall refer her to you. She will see you in the\r\nposition of mistress, and me in the position of maid\xe2\x80\x94no suspicion can\r\npossibly enter her mind, unless you put it there. If you only have the\r\ncourage to follow my instructions, and to say what I shall tell you to\r\nsay, the interview will be over in ten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou frighten me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louisa, still trembling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou take my\r\nbreath away with surprise. Courage! Where shall I find courage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I keep it for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin the passage-money to\r\nAustralia. Look at the new prospect which gives you a husband, and\r\nrestores you to your child\xe2\x80\x94and you will find your courage there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x99s sad face brightened; Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s faint heart beat quick. A spark\r\nof her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s spirit flew up into her eyes as she thought of the\r\ngolden future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you accept my proposal,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Magdalen, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can be asked in\r\nchurch at once, if you like. I promise you the money on the day when\r\nthe advertisement appears in the newspaper. The risk of the\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s rejecting me is my risk\xe2\x80\x94not yours. My good looks are\r\nsadly gone off, I know. But I think I can still hold my place against\r\nthe other servants\xe2\x80\x94I think I can still _look_ the parlor-maid whom\r\nAdmiral Bartram wants. There is nothing for you to fear in this matter;\r\nI should not have mentioned it if there had been. The only danger is\r\nthe danger of my being discovered at St. Crux, and that falls entirely\r\non me. By the time I am in the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s house you will be married, and\r\nthe ship will be taking you to your new life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x99s face, now brightening with hope, now clouding again with fear,\r\nshowed plain signs of the struggle which it cost her to decide. She\r\ntried to gain time; she attempted confusedly to speak a few words of\r\ngratitude; but her mistress silenced her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou owe me no thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you again, we are only\r\nhelping each other. I have very little money, but it is enough for your\r\npurpose, and I give it you freely. I have led a wretched life; I have\r\nmade others wretched about me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t even make you happy, except by\r\ntempting you to a new deceit. There! there! it\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault. Worse\r\nwomen than you are will help me, if you refuse. Decide as you like, but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of taking the money. If I succeed, I shall not want it.\r\nIf I fail\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, rose abruptly from her chair, and hid her face from Louisa\r\nby walking away to the fire-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I fail,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, warming her foot carelessly at the fender,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9call the money in the world will be of no use to me. Never mind\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94never mind Me\xe2\x80\x94think of yourself. I won\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of the\r\nconfession you have made to me; I won\xe2\x80\x99t influence you against your\r\nwill. Do as you yourself think best. But remember one thing\xe2\x80\x94my mind is\r\nmade up; nothing you can say or do will change it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sudden removal from the table, the altered tones of her voice as\r\nshe spoke the last words, appeared to renew Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. She\r\nclasped her hands together in her lap, and wrung them hard. \xe2\x80\x9cThis has\r\ncome on me very suddenly, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorely tempted\r\nto say Yes; and yet I am almost afraid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the night to consider it,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Magdalen, keeping her face\r\npersistently turned toward the fire; \xe2\x80\x9cand tell me what you have decided\r\nto do, when you come into my room to-morrow morning. I shall want no\r\nhelp to-night\xe2\x80\x94I can undress myself. You are not so strong as I am; you\r\nare tired, I dare say. Don\xe2\x80\x99t sit up on my account. Good-night, Louisa,\r\nand pleasant dreams!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice sank lower and lower as she spoke those kind words. She\r\nsighed heavily, and, leaning her arm on the mantel-piece, laid her head\r\non it with a reckless weariness miserable to see. Louisa had not left\r\nthe room, as she supposed\xe2\x80\x94Louisa came softly to her side, and kissed\r\nher hand. Magdalen started; but she made no attempt, this time, to draw\r\nher hand away. The sense of her own horrible isolation subdued her, at\r\nthe touch of the servant\xe2\x80\x99s lips. Her proud heart melted; her eyes\r\nfilled with burning tears. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t distress me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ntime for kindness has gone by; it only overpowers me now. Good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the morning came, the affirmative answer which Magdalen had\r\nanticipated was the answer given.\r\n\r\nOn that day the landlady received her week\xe2\x80\x99s notice to quit, and\r\nLouisa\xe2\x80\x99s needle flew fast through the stitches of the parlor-maid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE SIXTH SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\r\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nFrom Miss Garth to Mr. Pendril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWestmoreland House,\r\nJanuary 3d, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Pendril,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write, as you kindly requested, to report how Norah is going on, and\r\nto tell you what changes I see for the better in the state of her mind\r\non the subject of her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say that she is becoming resigned to Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s continued\r\nsilence\xe2\x80\x94I know her faithful nature too well to say it. I can only tell\r\nyou that she is beginning to find relief from the heavy pressure of\r\nsorrow and suspense in new thoughts and new hopes. I doubt if she has\r\nyet realized this in her own mind; but I see the result, although she\r\nis not conscious of it herself. I see her heart opening to the\r\nconsolation of another interest and another love. She has not said a\r\nword to me on the subject, nor have I said a word to her. But as\r\ncertainly as I know that Mr. George Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s visits have lately grown\r\nmore and more frequent to the family at Portland Place\xe2\x80\x94so certainly I\r\ncan assure you that Norah is finding a relief under her suspense, which\r\nis not of my bringing, and a hope in the future, which I have not\r\ntaught her to feel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is needless for me to say that I tell you this in the strictest\r\nconfidence. God knows whether the happy prospect which seems to me to\r\nbe just dawning will grow brighter or not as time goes on. The oftener\r\nI see Mr. George Bartram\xe2\x80\x94and he has called on me more than once\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstronger my liking for him grows. To my poor judgment he seems to be a\r\ngentleman in the highest and truest sense of the word. If I could live\r\nto see Norah his wife, I should almost feel that I had lived long\r\nenough. But who can discern the future? We have suffered so much that I\r\nam afraid to hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard anything of Magdalen? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why or how it is;\r\nbut since I have known of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death, my old tenderness for\r\nher seems to cling to me more obstinately than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways yours truly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHARRIET GARTH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nFrom Mr. Pendril to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerle Street, January 4th, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Mrs. Noel Vanstone herself I have heard nothing. But I have\r\nlearned, since I saw you, that the report of the position in which she\r\nis left by the death of her husband may be depended upon as the truth.\r\nNo legacy of any kind is bequeathed to her. Her name is not once\r\nmentioned in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowing what we know, it is not to be concealed that this circumstance\r\nthreatens us with more embarrassment, and perhaps with more distress.\r\nMrs. Noel Vanstone is not the woman to submit, without a desperate\r\nresistance, to the total overthrow of all her schemes and all her\r\nhopes. The mere fact that nothing whatever has been heard of her since\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s death is suggestive to my mind of serious mischief to\r\ncome. In her situation, and with her temper, the quieter she is now,\r\nthe more inveterately I, for one, distrust her in the future. It is\r\nimpossible to say to what violent measures her present extremity may\r\nnot drive her. It is impossible to feel sure that she may not be the\r\ncause of some public scandal this time, which may affect her innocent\r\nsister as well as herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you will not misinterpret the motive which has led me to write\r\nthese lines; I know you will not think that I am inconsiderate enough\r\nto cause you unnecessary alarm. My sincere anxiety to see that happy\r\nprospect realized to which your letter alludes has caused me to write\r\nfar less reservedly than I might otherwise have written. I strongly\r\nurge you to use your influence, on every occasion when you can fairly\r\nexert it, to strengthen that growing attachment, and to place it beyond\r\nthe reach of any coming disasters, while you have the opportunity of\r\ndoing so. When I tell you that the fortune of which Mrs. Noel Vanstone\r\nhas been deprived is entirely bequeathed to Admiral Bartram; and when I\r\nadd that Mr. George Bartram is generally understood to be his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheir\xe2\x80\x94you will, I think, acknowledge that I am not warning you without a\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours most truly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWILLIAM PENDRIL.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nFrom Admiral Bartram to Mrs. Drake\r\n(housekeeper at St. Crux).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Crux, January 10th, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMRS. DRAKE,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have received your letter from London, stating that you have found\r\nme a new parlor-maid at last, and that the girl is ready to return with\r\nyou to St. Crux when your other errands in town allow you to come back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis arrangement must be altered immediately, for a reason which I am\r\nheartily sorry to have to write.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe illness of my niece, Mrs. Girdlestone\xe2\x80\x94which appeared to be so\r\nslight as to alarm none of us, doctors included\xe2\x80\x94has ended fatally. I\r\nreceived this morning the shocking news of her death. Her husband is\r\nsaid to be quite frantic with grief. Mr. George has already gone to his\r\nbrother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s, to superintend the last melancholy duties and I must\r\nfollow him before the funeral takes place. We propose to take Mr.\r\nGirdlestone away afterward, and to try the effect on him of change of\r\nplace and new scenes. Under these sad circumstances, I may be absent\r\nfrom St. Crux a month or six weeks at least; the house will be shut up,\r\nand the new servant will not be wanted until my return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will therefore tell the girl, on receiving this letter, that a\r\ndeath in the family has caused a temporary change in our arrangements.\r\nIf she is willing to wait, you may safely engage her to come here in\r\nsix weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time; I shall be back then, if Mr. George is not. If she\r\nrefuses, pay her what compensation is right, and so have done with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cARTHUR BARTRAM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nFrom Mrs. Drake to Admiral Bartram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJanuary 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHONORED SIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to get my errands done, and to return to St. Crux to-morrow,\r\nbut write to save you anxiety, in case of delay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young woman whom I have engaged (Louisa by name) is willing to\r\nwait your time; and her present mistress, taking an interest in her\r\nwelfare, will provide for her during the interval. She understands that\r\nshe is to enter on her new service in six weeks from the present\r\ndate\xe2\x80\x94namely, on the twenty-fifth of February next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegging you will accept my respectful sympathy under the sad\r\nbereavement which has befallen the family,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remain, honored sir, your humble servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSOPHIA DRAKE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH SCENE.\r\nST. CRUX-IN-THE-MARSH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where you are to sleep. Put yourself tidy, and then come down\r\nagain to my room. The admiral has returned, and you will have to begin\r\nby waiting on him at dinner to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, Mrs. Drake, the housekeeper, closed the door; and the\r\nnew parlor-maid was left alone in her bed-chamber at St. Crux.\r\n\r\nThat day was the eventful twenty-fifth of February. In barely four\r\nmonths from the time when Mrs. Lecount had placed her master\xe2\x80\x99s private\r\nInstructions in his Executor\xe2\x80\x99s hands, the one combination of\r\ncircumstances against which it had been her first and foremost object\r\nto provide was exactly the combination which had now taken place. Mr.\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s widow and Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Trust were together\r\nin the same house.\r\n\r\nThus far, events had declared themselves without an exception in\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s favor. Thus far, the path which had led her to St. Crux had\r\nbeen a path without an obstacle: Louisa, whose name she had now taken,\r\nhad sailed three days since for Australia, with her husband and her\r\nchild; she was the only living creature whom Magdalen had trusted with\r\nher secret, and she was by this time out of sight of the English land.\r\nThe girl had been careful, reliable and faithfully devoted to her\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s interests to the last. She had passed the ordeal of her\r\ninterview with the housekeeper, and had forgotten none of the\r\ninstructions by which she had been prepared to meet it. She had herself\r\nproposed to turn the six weeks\xe2\x80\x99 delay, caused by the death in the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s family, to good account, by continuing the all-important\r\npractice of those domestic lessons, on the perfect acquirement of which\r\nher mistress\xe2\x80\x99s daring stratagem depended for its success. Thanks to the\r\ntime thus gained, when Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s marriage was over, and the day of\r\nparting had come, Magdalen had learned and mastered, in the nicest\r\ndetail, everything that her former servant could teach her. On the day\r\nwhen she passed the doors of St. Crux she entered on her desperate\r\nventure, strong in the ready presence of mind under emergencies which\r\nher later life had taught her, stronger still in the trained capacity\r\nthat she possessed for the assumption of a character not her own,\r\nstrongest of all in her two months\xe2\x80\x99 daily familiarity with the\r\npractical duties of the position which she had undertaken to fill.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mrs. Drake\xe2\x80\x99s departure had left her alone, she unpacked her\r\nbox, and dressed herself for the evening.\r\n\r\nShe put on a lavender-colored stuff-gown\xe2\x80\x94half-mourning for Mrs.\r\nGirdlestone; ordered for all the servants, under the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstructions\xe2\x80\x94a white muslin apron, and a neat white cap and collar,\r\nwith ribbons to match the gown. In this servant\xe2\x80\x99s costume\xe2\x80\x94in the plain\r\ngown fastening high round her neck, in the neat little white cap at the\r\nback of her head\xe2\x80\x94in this simple dress, to the eyes of all men, not\r\nlinen-drapers, at once the most modest and the most alluring that a\r\nwoman can wear, the sad changes which mental suffering had wrought in\r\nher beauty almost disappeared from view. In the evening costume of a\r\nlady, with her bosom uncovered, with her figure armed, rather than\r\ndressed, in unpliable silk, the admiral might have passed her by\r\nwithout notice in his own drawing-room. In the evening costume of a\r\nservant, no admirer of beauty could have looked at her once and not\r\nhave turned again to look at her for the second time.\r\n\r\nDescending the stairs, on her way to the house-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s room, she\r\npassed by the entrances to two long stone corridors, with rows of doors\r\nopening on them; one corridor situated on the second, and one on the\r\nfirst floor of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cMany rooms!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, as she looked at\r\nthe doors. \xe2\x80\x9cWeary work searching here for what I have come to find!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn reaching the ground-floor she was met by a weather-beaten old man,\r\nwho stopped and stared at her with an appearance of great interest. He\r\nwas the same old man whom Captain Wragge had seen in the backyard at\r\nSt. Crux, at work on the model of a ship. All round the neighborhood he\r\nwas known, far and wide, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe admiral\xe2\x80\x99s coxswain.\xe2\x80\x9d His name was\r\nMazey. Sixty years had written their story of hard work at sea, and\r\nhard drinking on shore, on the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s grim and wrinkled face. Sixty\r\nyears had proved his fidelity, and had brought his battered old\r\ncarcass, at the end of the voyage, into port in his master\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nSeeing no one else of whom she could inquire, Magdalen requested the\r\nold man to show her the way that led to the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey, speaking in the high and\r\nhollow voice peculiar to the deaf. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the new maid\xe2\x80\x94eh? And a\r\nfine-grown girl, too! His honor, the admiral, likes a parlor-maid with\r\na clean run fore and aft. You\xe2\x80\x99ll do, my dear\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not mind what Mr. Mazey says to you,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the\r\nhousekeeper, opening her door as the old sailor expressed his approval\r\nof Magdalen in these terms. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is privileged to talk as he pleases;\r\nand he is very tiresome and slovenly in his habits; but he means no\r\nharm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that apology for the veteran, Mrs. Drake led Magdalen first to the\r\npantry, and next to the linen-room, installing her, with all due\r\nformality, in her own domestic dominions. This ceremony completed, the\r\nnew parlor-maid was taken upstairs, and was shown the dining-room,\r\nwhich opened out of the corridor on the first floor. Here she was\r\ndirected to lay the cloth, and to prepare the table for one person\r\nonly\xe2\x80\x94Mr. George Bartram not having returned with his uncle to St. Crux.\r\nMrs. Drake\xe2\x80\x99s sharp eyes watched Magdalen attentively as she performed\r\nthis introductory duty; and Mrs. Drake\xe2\x80\x99s private convictions, when the\r\ntable was spread, forced her to acknowledge, so far, that the new\r\nservant thoroughly understood her work.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the soup-tureen was placed on the table; and Magdalen\r\nstood alone behind the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s empty chair, waiting her master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst inspection of her when he entered the dining-room.\r\n\r\nA large bell rang in the lower regions\xe2\x80\x94quick, shambling footsteps\r\npattered on the stone corridor outside\xe2\x80\x94the door opened suddenly\xe2\x80\x94and a\r\ntall lean yellow old man, sharp as to his eyes, shrewd as to his lips,\r\nfussily restless as to all his movements, entered the room, with two\r\nhuge Labrador dogs at his heels, and took his seat in a violent hurry.\r\nThe dogs followed him, and placed themselves, with the utmost gravity\r\nand composure, one on each side of his chair. This was Admiral Bartram,\r\nand these were the companions of his solitary meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay! ay! here\xe2\x80\x99s the new parlor-maid, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d he began, looking\r\nsharply, but not at all unkindly, at Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name, my\r\ngood girl? Louisa, is it? I shall call you Lucy, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\r\nTake off the cover, my dear\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m a minute or two late to-day. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nunpunctual to-morrow on that account; I am as regular as clock-work\r\ngenerally. How are you after your journey? Did my spring-cart bump you\r\nabout much in bringing you from the station? Capital soup this\xe2\x80\x94hot as\r\nfire\xe2\x80\x94reminds me of the soup we used to have in the West Indies in the\r\nyear Three. Have you got your half-mourning on? Stand there, and let me\r\nsee. Ah, yes, very neat, and nice, and tidy. Poor Mrs. Girdlestone! Oh\r\ndear, dear, dear, poor Mrs. Girdlestone! You\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid of dogs, are\r\nyou, Lucy? Eh? What? You like dogs? That\xe2\x80\x99s right! Always be kind to\r\ndumb animals. These two dogs dine with me every day, except when\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s company. The dog with the black nose is Brutus, and the dog\r\nwith the white nose is Cassius. Did you ever hear who Brutus and\r\nCassius were? Ancient Romans? That\xe2\x80\x99s right\xe2\x80\x94-good girl. Mind your book\r\nand your needle, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a good husband one of these days.\r\nTake away the soup, my dear, take away the soup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the man whose secret it was now the one interest of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife to surprise! This was the man whose name had supplanted hers in\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s will!\r\n\r\nThe fish and the roast meat followed; and the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s talk rambled\r\non\xe2\x80\x94now in soliloquy, now addressed to the parlor-maid, and now directed\r\nto the dogs\xe2\x80\x94as familiarly and as discontentedly as ever. Magdalen\r\nobserved with some surprise that the companions of the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s dinner\r\nhad, thus far, received no scraps from their master\xe2\x80\x99s plate. The two\r\nmagnificent brutes sat squatted on their haunches, with their great\r\nheads over the table, watching the progress of the meal, with the\r\nprofoundest attention, but apparently expecting no share in it. The\r\nroast meat was removed, the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s plate was changed, and Magdalen\r\ntook the silver covers off the two made-dishes on either side of the\r\ntable. As she handed the first of the savory dishes to her master, the\r\ndogs suddenly exhibited a breathless personal interest in the\r\nproceedings. Brutus gluttonously watered at the mouth; and the tongue\r\nof Cassius, protruding in unutterable expectation, smoked again between\r\nhis enormous jaws.\r\n\r\nThe admiral helped himself liberally from the dish; sent Magdalen to\r\nthe side-table to get him some bread; and, when he thought her eye was\r\noff him, furtively tumbled the whole contents of his plate into\r\nBrutus\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Cassius whined faintly as his fortunate comrade\r\nswallowed the savory mess at a gulp. \xe2\x80\x9cHush! you fool,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the\r\nadmiral. \xe2\x80\x9cYour turn next!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen presented the second dish. Once more the old gentleman helped\r\nhimself largely\xe2\x80\x94once more he sent her away to the side-table\xe2\x80\x94once more\r\nhe tumbled the entire contents of the plate down the dog\xe2\x80\x99s throat,\r\nselecting Cassius this time, as became a considerate master and an\r\nimpartial man. When the next course followed\xe2\x80\x94consisting of a plain\r\npudding and an unwholesome \xe2\x80\x9ccream\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion of the function\r\nof the dogs at the dinner-table was confirmed. While the master took\r\nthe simple pudding, the dogs swallowed the elaborate cream. The admiral\r\nwas plainly afraid of offending his cook on the one hand, and of\r\noffending his digestion on the other\xe2\x80\x94and Brutus and Cassius were the\r\ntwo trained accomplices who regularly helped him every day off the\r\nhorns of his dilemma. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good! very good!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman,\r\nwith the most transparent duplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cTell the cook, my dear, a capital\r\ncream!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving placed the wine and dessert on the table, Magdalen was about to\r\nwithdraw. Before she could leave the room, her master called her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d said the admiral; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know the ways of the house\r\nyet, Lucy. Put another wine-glass here, at my right hand\xe2\x80\x94the largest\r\nyou can find, my dear. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a third dog, who comes in at dessert\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndrunken old sea-dog who has followed my fortunes, afloat and ashore,\r\nfor fifty years and more. Yes, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of glass we want.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good girl\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re a neat, handy girl. Steady, my dear! there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing to be frightened at!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden thump on the outside of the door, followed by one mighty bark\r\nfrom each of the dogs, had made Magdalen start. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the\r\nadmiral. The door opened; the tails of Brutus and Cassius cheerfully\r\nthumped the floor; and old Mazey marched straight up to the right-hand\r\nside of his master\xe2\x80\x99s chair. The veteran stood there, with his legs wide\r\napart and his balance carefully adjusted, as if the dining-room had\r\nbeen a cabin, and the house a ship pitching in a sea-way.\r\n\r\nThe admiral filled the large glass with port, filled his own glass with\r\nclaret, and raised it to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the Queen, Mazey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the admiral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the Queen, your honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey, swallowing his port,\r\nas the dogs swallowed the made-dishes, at a gulp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the wind, Mazey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWest and by Noathe, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny report to-night, Mazey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo report, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, Mazey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe after-dinner ceremony thus completed, old Mazey made his bow, and\r\nwalked out of the room again. Brutus and Cassius stretched themselves\r\non the rug to digest mushrooms and made gravies in the lubricating heat\r\nof the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cFor what we have received, the Lord make us truly\r\nthankful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the admiral. \xe2\x80\x9cGo downstairs, my good girl, and get your\r\nsupper. A light meal, Lucy, if you take my advice\xe2\x80\x94a light meal, or you\r\nwill have the nightmare. Early to bed, my dear, and early to rise,\r\nmakes a parlor-maid healthy and wealthy and wise. That\xe2\x80\x99s the wisdom of\r\nyour ancestors\xe2\x80\x94you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at it. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d In those words\r\nMagdalen was dismissed; and so her first day\xe2\x80\x99s experience of Admiral\r\nBartram came to an end.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the next morning, the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s directions to the new\r\nparlor-maid included among them one particular order which, in\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s situation, it was especially her interest to receive. In the\r\nold gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s absence from home that day, on local business which\r\ntook him to Ossory, she was directed to make herself acquainted with\r\nthe whole inhabited quarter of the house, and to learn the positions of\r\nthe various rooms, so as to know where the bells called her when the\r\nbells rang. Mrs. Drake was charged with the duty of superintending the\r\nvoyage of domestic discovery, unless she happened to be otherwise\r\nengaged\xe2\x80\x94in which case any one of the inferior servants would be equally\r\ncompetent to act as Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s guide.\r\n\r\nAt noon the admiral left for Ossory, and Magdalen presented herself in\r\nMrs. Drake\xe2\x80\x99s room, to be shown over the house. Mrs. Drake happened to\r\nbe otherwise engaged, and referred her to the head house-maid. The head\r\nhouse-maid happened on that particular morning to be in the same\r\ncondition as Mrs. Drake, and referred her to the under-house-maids. The\r\nunder-house-maids declared they were all behindhand and had not a\r\nminute to spare\xe2\x80\x94they suggested, not too civilly, that old Mazey had\r\nnothing on earth to do, and that he knew the house as well, or better,\r\nthan he knew his A B C. Magdalen took the hint, with a secret\r\nindignation and contempt which it cost her a hard struggle to conceal.\r\nShe had suspected, on the previous night, and she was certain now, that\r\nthe women-servants all incomprehensibly resented her presence among\r\nthem with the same sullen unanimity of distrust. Mrs. Drake, as she had\r\nseen for herself, was really engaged that morning over her accounts.\r\nBut of all the servants under her who had made their excuses not one\r\nhad even affected to be more occupied than usual. Their looks said\r\nplainly, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t like you; and we won\xe2\x80\x99t show you over the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe found her way to old Mazey, not by the scanty directions given her,\r\nbut by the sound of the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s cracked and quavering voice, singing\r\nin some distant seclusion a verse of the immortal sea-song\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTom\r\nBowling.\xe2\x80\x9d Just as she stopped among the rambling stone passages on the\r\nbasement story of the house, uncertain which way to turn next, she\r\nheard the tuneless old voice in the distance, singing these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis form was of the manliest beau-u-u-uty,\r\n    His heart was ki-i-ind and soft;\r\nFaithful below Tom did his duty,\r\n    But now he\xe2\x80\x99s gone alo-o-o-o-oft\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    But now he\xe2\x80\x99s go-o-o-one aloft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMagdalen followed in the direction of the quavering voice, and found\r\nherself in a little room looking out on the back yard. There sat old\r\nMazey, with his spectacles low on his nose, and his knotty old hands\r\nblundering over the rigging of his model ship. There were Brutus and\r\nCassius digesting before the fire again, and snoring as if they\r\nthoroughly enjoyed it. There was Lord Nelson on one wall, in flaming\r\nwatercolors; and there, on the other, was a portrait of Admiral\r\nBartram\xe2\x80\x99s last flagship, in full sail on a sea of slate, with a\r\nsalmon-colored sky to complete the illusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, they won\xe2\x80\x99t show you over the house\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, then! That head house-maid\xe2\x80\x99s a sour one, my dear\xe2\x80\x94if ever there\r\nwas a sour one yet. You\xe2\x80\x99re too young and good-looking to please\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what you are.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose, took off his spectacles, and feebly\r\nmended the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s as straight as a poplar,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey,\r\nconsidering Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s figure in drowsy soliloquy. \xe2\x80\x9cI say she\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nstraight as a poplar, and his honor the admiral says so too! Come\r\nalong, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, addressing himself to Magdalen again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you your Pints of the Compass first. When you know your\r\nPints, blow high, blow low, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it plain sailing all over the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the door\xe2\x80\x94stopped, and suddenly bethinking himself of\r\nhis miniature ship, went back to put his model away in an empty\r\ncupboard\xe2\x80\x94led the way to the door again\xe2\x80\x94stopped once more\xe2\x80\x94remembered\r\nthat some of the rooms were chilly\xe2\x80\x94and pottered about, swearing and\r\ngrumbling, and looking for his hat. Magdalen sat down patiently to wait\r\nfor him. She gratefully contrasted his treatment of her with the\r\ntreatment she had received from the women. Resist it as firmly, despise\r\nit as proudly as we may, all studied unkindness\xe2\x80\x94no matter how\r\ncontemptible it may be\xe2\x80\x94has a stinging power in it which reaches to the\r\nquick. Magdalen only knew how she had felt the small malice of the\r\nfemale servants, by the effect which the rough kindness of the old\r\nsailor produced on her afterward. The dumb welcome of the dogs, when\r\nthe movements in the room had roused them from their sleep, touched her\r\nmore acutely still. Brutus pushed his mighty muzzle companionably into\r\nher hand; and Cassius laid his friendly fore-paw on her lap. Her heart\r\nyearned over the two creatures as she patted and caressed them. It\r\nseemed only yesterday since she and the dogs at Combe-Raven had roamed\r\nthe garden together, and had idled away the summer mornings luxuriously\r\non the shady lawn.\r\n\r\nOld Mazey found his hat at last, and they started on their exploring\r\nexpedition, with the dogs after them.\r\n\r\nLeaving the basement story of the house, which was entirely devoted to\r\nthe servants\xe2\x80\x99 offices, they ascended to the first floor, and entered\r\nthe long corridor, with which Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s last night\xe2\x80\x99s experience had\r\nalready made her acquainted. \xe2\x80\x9cPut your back ag\xe2\x80\x99in this wall,\xe2\x80\x9d said old\r\nMazey, pointing to the long wall\xe2\x80\x94pierced at irregular intervals with\r\nwindows looking out over a courtyard and fish-pond\xe2\x80\x94which formed the\r\nright-hand side of the corridor, as Magdalen now stood. \xe2\x80\x9cPut your back\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the veteran, \xe2\x80\x9cand look straight afore you. What do you\r\nsee?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe opposite wall of the passage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay! what\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe doors leading into the rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI see nothing\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d Old Mazey chuckled, winked, and shook his knotty forefinger at\r\nMagdalen, impressively. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see one of the Pints of the Compass, my\r\ndear. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your back ag\xe2\x80\x99in this wall, and when you look\r\nstraight afore you, you look Noathe. If you ever get lost hereaway, put\r\nyour back ag\xe2\x80\x99in the wall, look out straight afore you, and say to\r\nyourself: \xe2\x80\x98I look Noathe!\xe2\x80\x99 You do that like a good girl, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlose your bearings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter administering this preliminary dose of instruction, old Mazey\r\nopened the first of the doors on the left-hand side of the passage. It\r\nled into the dining-room, with which Magdalen was already familiar. The\r\nsecond room was fitted up as a library; and the third, as a\r\nmorning-room. The fourth and fifth doors\xe2\x80\x94both belonging to dismantled\r\nand uninhabited rooms, and both locked-brought them to the end of the\r\nnorth wing of the house, and to the opening of a second and shorter\r\npassage, placed at a right angle to the first. Here old Mazey, who had\r\ndivided his time pretty equally during the investigation of the rooms,\r\nin talking of \xe2\x80\x9chis honor the Admiral,\xe2\x80\x9d and whistling to the dogs,\r\nreturned with all possible expedition to the points of the compass, and\r\ngravely directed Magdalen to repeat the ceremony of putting her back\r\nagainst the wall. She attempted to shorten the proceedings, by\r\ndeclaring (quite correctly) that in her present position she knew she\r\nwas looking east. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you talk about the east, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said old\r\nMazey, proceeding unmoved with his own system of instruction, \xe2\x80\x9ctill you\r\nknow the east first. Put your back ag\xe2\x80\x99in this wall, and look straight\r\nafore you. What do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d The remainder of the catechism proceeded\r\nas before. When the end was reached, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s instructor was\r\nsatisfied. He chuckled and winked at her once more. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you may talk\r\nabout the east, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the veteran, \xe2\x80\x9cfor now you know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe east passage, after leading them on for a few yards only,\r\nterminated in a vestibule, with a high door in it which faced them as\r\nthey advanced. The door admitted them to a large and lofty\r\ndrawing-room, decorated, like all the other apartments, with valuable\r\nold-fashioned furniture. Leading the way across this room, Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconductor pushed back a heavy sliding-door, opposite the door of\r\nentrance. \xe2\x80\x9cPut your apron over your head,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\ncoming to the Banqueting-Hall now. The floor\xe2\x80\x99s mortal cold, and the\r\ndamp sticks to the place like cockroaches to a collier. His honor the\r\nadmiral calls it the Arctic Passage. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my name for it, too\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncall it, Freeze-your-Bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen passed through the doorway, and found herself in the ancient\r\nBanqueting-Hall of St. Crux.\r\n\r\nOn her left hand she saw a row of lofty windows, set deep in\r\nembrasures, and extending over a frontage of more than a hundred feet\r\nin length. On her right hand, ranged in one long row from end to end of\r\nthe opposite wall, hung a dismal collection of black, begrimed old\r\npictures, rotting from their frames, and representing battle-scenes by\r\nsea and land. Below the pictures, midway down the length of the wall,\r\nyawned a huge cavern of a fireplace, surmounted by a towering\r\nmantel-piece of black marble. The one object of furniture (if furniture\r\nit might be called) visible far or near in the vast emptiness of the\r\nplace, was a gaunt ancient tripod of curiously chased metal, standing\r\nlonely in the middle of the hall, and supporting a wide circular pan,\r\nfilled deep with ashes from an extinct charcoal fire. The high ceiling,\r\nonce finely carved and gilt, was foul with dirt and cobwebs; the naked\r\nwalls at either end of the room were stained with damp; and the cold of\r\nthe marble floor struck through the narrow strip of matting laid down,\r\nparallel with the windows, as a foot-path for passengers across the\r\nwilderness of the room. No better name for it could have been devised\r\nthan the name which old Mazey had found. \xe2\x80\x9cFreeze-your-Bones\xe2\x80\x9d accurately\r\ndescribed, in three words, the Banqueting-Hall at St. Crux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you never light a fire in this dismal place?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all depends on which side of Freeze-your-Bones his honor the\r\nadmiral lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey. \xe2\x80\x9cHis honor likes to shift his quarters,\r\nsometimes to one side of the house, sometimes to the other. If he lives\r\nNoathe of Freeze-your-Bones\xe2\x80\x94which is where you\xe2\x80\x99ve just come from\xe2\x80\x94we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t waste our coals here. If he lives South of\r\nFreeze-your-Bones\xe2\x80\x94which is where we are going to next\xe2\x80\x94we light the fire\r\nin the grate and the charcoal in the pan. Every night, when we do that,\r\nthe damp gets the better of us: every morning, we turn to again, and\r\nget the better of the damp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this remarkable explanation, old Mazey led the way to the lower\r\nend of the Hall, opened more doors, and showed Magdalen through another\r\nsuite of rooms, four in number, all of moderate size, and all furnished\r\nin much the same manner as the rooms in the northern wing. She looked\r\nout of the windows, and saw the neglected gardens of St. Crux,\r\novergrown with brambles and weeds. Here and there, at no great distance\r\nin the grounds, the smoothly curving line of one of the tidal streams\r\npeculiar to the locality wound its way, gleaming in the sunlight,\r\nthrough gaps in the brambles and trees. The more distant view ranged\r\nover the flat eastward country beyond, speckled with its scattered\r\nlittle villages; crossed and recrossed by its network of \xe2\x80\x9cback-waters\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand terminated abruptly by the long straight line of sea-wall which\r\nprotects the defenseless coast of Essex from invasion by the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave we more rooms still to see?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magdalen, turning from the\r\nview of the garden, and looking about her for another door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more, my dear\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve run aground here, and we may as well wear round\r\nand put back again,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another side of the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94due south of you as you stand now\xe2\x80\x94which is all tumbling about our\r\nears. You must go out into the garden if you want to see it; it\xe2\x80\x99s built\r\noff from us by a brick bulkhead, t\xe2\x80\x99other side of this wall here. The\r\nmonks lived due south of us, my dear, hundreds of years afore his honor\r\nthe admiral was born or thought of, and a fine time of it they had, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard. They sang in the church all the morning, and drank grog in\r\nthe orchard all the afternoon. They slept off their grog on the best of\r\nfeather-beds, and they fattened on the neighborhood all the year round.\r\nLucky beggars! lucky beggars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApostrophizing the monks in these terms, and evidently regretting that\r\nhe had not lived himself in those good old times, the veteran led the\r\nway back through the rooms. On the return passage across\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreeze-your-Bones,\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalen preceded him. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s as straight as a\r\npoplar,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled old Mazey to himself, hobbling along after his\r\nyouthful companion, and wagging his venerable head in cordial approval.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was particular what nation they belonged to; but I always\r\n_did_ like \xe2\x80\x99em straight and fine grown, and I always _shall_ like \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nstraight and fine grown, to my dying day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there more rooms to see upstairs, on the second floor?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMagdalen, when they had returned to the point from which they had\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nThe naturally clear, distinct tones of her voice had hitherto reached\r\nthe old sailor\xe2\x80\x99s imperfect sense of hearing easily enough. Rather to\r\nher surprise, he became stone deaf on a sudden, to her last question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of your Pints of the Compass?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot sure, put your back ag\xe2\x80\x99in the wall, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go all over \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nagain, my dear, beginning with the Noathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen assured him that she felt quite familiar, by this time, with\r\nall the points, the \xe2\x80\x9cNoathe\xe2\x80\x9d included; and then repeated her question\r\nin louder tones. The veteran obstinately matched her by becoming deafer\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re right; it _is_ chilly in these\r\npassages; and unless I go back to my fire, my fire\xe2\x80\x99ll go out\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel sure of your Pints of the Compass, come in to me and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll put you right again.\xe2\x80\x9d He winked benevolently, whistled to the\r\ndogs, and hobbled off. Magdalen heard him chuckle over his own success\r\nin balking her curiosity on the subject of the second floor. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nhow to deal with \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey to himself, in high triumph.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTall and short, native and foreign, sweethearts and wives\xe2\x80\x94_I_ know how\r\nto deal with \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft by herself, Magdalen exemplified the excellence of the old\r\nsailor\xe2\x80\x99s method of treatment, in her particular case, by ascending the\r\nstairs immediately, to make her own observations on the second floor.\r\nThe stone passage here was exactly similar, except that more doors\r\nopened out of it, to the passage on the first floor. She opened the two\r\nnearest doors, one after another, at a venture, and discovered that\r\nboth rooms were bed-chambers. The fear of being discovered by one of\r\nthe woman-servants in a part of the house with which she had no\r\nconcern, warned her not to push her investigations on the bedroom floor\r\ntoo far at starting. She hurriedly walked down the passage to see where\r\nit ended, discovered that it came to its termination in a lumber-room,\r\nanswering to the position of the vestibule downstairs, and retraced her\r\nsteps immediately.\r\n\r\nOn her way back she noticed an object which had previously escaped her\r\nattention. It was a low truckle-bed, placed parallel with the wall, and\r\nclose to one of the doors on the bedroom side. In spite of its strange\r\nand comfortless situation, the bed was apparently occupied at night by\r\na sleeper; the sheets were on it, and the end of a thick red\r\nfisherman\xe2\x80\x99s cap peeped out from under the pillow. She ventured on\r\nopening the door near which the bed was placed, and found herself, as\r\nshe conjectured from certain signs and tokens, in the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsleeping chamber. A moment\xe2\x80\x99s observation of the room was all she dared\r\nrisk, and, softly closing the door again, she returned to the kitchen\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe truckle-bed, and the strange position in which it was placed, dwelt\r\non her mind all through the afternoon. Who could possibly sleep in it?\r\nThe remembrance of the red fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s cap, and the knowledge she had\r\nalready gained of Mazey\xe2\x80\x99s dog-like fidelity to his master, helped her\r\nto guess that the old sailor might be the occupant of the truckle-bed.\r\nBut why, with bedrooms enough and to spare, should he occupy that cold\r\nand comfortless situation at night? Why should he sleep on guard\r\noutside his master\xe2\x80\x99s door? Was there some nocturnal danger in the house\r\nof which the admiral was afraid? The question seemed absurd, and yet\r\nthe position of the bed forced it irresistibly on her mind.\r\n\r\nStimulated by her own ungovernable curiosity on this subject, Magdalen\r\nventured to question the housekeeper. She acknowledged having walked\r\nfrom end to end of the passage on the second floor, to see if it was as\r\nlong as the passage on the first; and she mentioned having noticed with\r\nastonishment the position of the truckle-bed. Mrs. Drake answered her\r\nimplied inquiry shortly and sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame a young girl like\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, \xe2\x80\x9cfor being a little curious when she first\r\ncomes into such a strange house as this. But remember, for the future,\r\nthat your business does not lie on the bedroom story. Mr. Mazey sleeps\r\non that bed you noticed. It is his habit at night to sleep outside his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s door.\xe2\x80\x9d With that meager explanation Mrs. Drake\xe2\x80\x99s lips closed,\r\nand opened no more.\r\n\r\nLater in the day Magdalen found an opportunity of applying to old Mazey\r\nhimself. She discovered the veteran in high good humor, smoking his\r\npipe, and warming a tin mug of ale at his own snug fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mazey,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you put your bed in that cold\r\npassage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you have been upstairs, you young jade, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d said old\r\nMazey, looking up from his mug with a leer.\r\n\r\nMagdalen smiled and nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! come! tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, coaxingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you sleep outside the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you part your hair in the middle, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked old Mazey,\r\nwith another leer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, because I am accustomed to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Magdalen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said the veteran. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why, is it? Well, my dear, the\r\nreason why you part your hair in the middle is the reason why I sleep\r\noutside the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s door. I know how to deal with \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled old\r\nMazey, lapsing into soliloquy, and stirring up his ale in high triumph.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTall and short, native and foreign, sweethearts and wives\xe2\x80\x94_I_ know how\r\nto deal with \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s third and last attempt at solving the mystery of the\r\ntruckle-bed was made while she was waiting on the admiral at dinner.\r\nThe old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s questions gave her an opportunity of referring to\r\nthe subject, without any appearance of presumption or disrespect; but\r\nhe proved to be quite as impenetrable, in his way, as old Mazey and\r\nMrs. Drake had been in theirs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe admiral, bluntly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be curious. Look in your Old Testament\r\nwhen you go downstairs, and see what happened in the Garden of Eden\r\nthrough curiosity. Be a good girl, and don\xe2\x80\x99t imitate your mother Eve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLate at night, as Magdalen passed the end of the second-floor passage,\r\nproceeding alone on her way up to her own room, she stopped and\r\nlistened. A screen was placed at the entrance of the corridor, so as to\r\nhide it from the view of persons passing on the stairs. The snoring she\r\nheard on the other side of the screen encouraged her to slip round it,\r\nand to advance a few steps. Shading the light of her candle with her\r\nhand, she ventured close to the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s door, and saw, to her\r\nsurprise, that the bed had been moved since she had seen it in the\r\nday-time, so as to stand exactly across the door, and to bar the way\r\nentirely to any one who might attempt to enter the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\nAfter this discovery, old Mazey himself, snoring lustily, with the red\r\nfisherman\xe2\x80\x99s cap pulled down to his eyebrows, and the blankets drawn up\r\nto his nose, became an object of secondary importance only, by\r\ncomparison with his bed. That the veteran did actually sleep on guard\r\nbefore his master\xe2\x80\x99s door, and that he and the admiral and the\r\nhousekeeper were in the secret of this unaccountable proceeding, was\r\nnow beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange end,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Magdalen, pondering over her discovery as she\r\nstole upstairs to her own sleeping-room\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca strange end to a strange\r\nday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe first week passed, the second week passed, and Magdalen was, to all\r\nappearance, no nearer to the discovery of the Secret Trust than on the\r\nday when she first entered on her service at St. Crux.\r\n\r\nBut the fortnight, uneventful as it was, had not been a fortnight lost.\r\nExperience had already satisfied her on one important point\xe2\x80\x94experience\r\nhad shown that she could set the rooted distrust of the other servants\r\nsafely at defiance. Time had accustomed the women to her presence in\r\nthe house, without shaking the vague conviction which possessed them\r\nall alike, that the newcomer was not one of themselves. All that\r\nMagdalen could do in her own defense was to keep the instinctive female\r\nsuspicion of her confined within those purely negative limits which it\r\nhad occupied from the first, and this she accomplished.\r\n\r\nDay after day the women watched her with the untiring vigilance of\r\nmalice and distrust, and day after day not the vestige of a discovery\r\nrewarded them for their pains. Silently, intelligently, and\r\nindustriously\xe2\x80\x94with an ever-present remembrance of herself and her\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94the new parlor-maid did her work. Her only intervals of rest and\r\nrelaxation were the intervals passed occasionally in the day with old\r\nMazey and the dogs, and the precious interval of the night during which\r\nshe was secure from observation in the solitude of her room. Thanks to\r\nthe superfluity of bed-chambers at St. Crux, each one of the servants\r\nhad the choice, if she pleased, of sleeping in a room of her own. Alone\r\nin the night, Magdalen might dare to be herself again\xe2\x80\x94might dream of\r\nthe past, and wake from the dream, encountering no curious eyes to\r\nnotice that she was in tears\xe2\x80\x94might ponder over the future, and be\r\nroused by no whisperings in corners, which tainted her with the\r\nsuspicion of \xe2\x80\x9chaving something on her mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSatisfied, thus far, of the perfect security of her position in the\r\nhouse, she profited next by a second chance in her favor, which\xe2\x80\x94before\r\nthe fortnight was at an end\xe2\x80\x94relieved her mind of all doubt on the\r\nformidable subject of Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nPartly from the accidental gossip of the women at the table in the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 hall; partly from a marked paragraph in a Swiss newspaper,\r\nwhich she had found one morning lying open on the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neasy-chair\xe2\x80\x94she gained the welcome assurance that no danger was to be\r\ndreaded, this time, from the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s presence on the scene. Mrs.\r\nLecount had, as it appeared, passed a week or more at St. Crux after\r\nthe date of her master\xe2\x80\x99s death, and had then left England, to live on\r\nthe interest of her legacy, in honorable and prosperous retirement, in\r\nher native place. The paragraph in the Swiss newspaper described the\r\nfulfillment of this laudable project. Mrs. Lecount had not only\r\nestablished herself at Zurich, but (wisely mindful of the uncertainty\r\nof life) had also settled the charitable uses to which her fortune was\r\nto be applied after her death. One half of it was to go to the founding\r\nof a \xe2\x80\x9cLecompte Scholarship\xe2\x80\x9d for poor students in the University of\r\nGeneva. The other half was to be employed by the municipal authorities\r\nof Zurich in the maintenance and education of a certain number of\r\norphan girls, natives of the city, who were to be trained for domestic\r\nservice in later life. The Swiss journalist adverted to these\r\nphilanthropic bequests in terms of extravagant eulogy. Zurich was\r\ncongratulated on the possession of a Paragon of public virtue; and\r\nWilliam Tell, in the character of benefactor to Switzerland, was\r\ncompared disadvantageously with Mrs. Lecount.\r\n\r\nThe third week began, and Magdalen was now at liberty to take her first\r\nstep forward on the way to the discovery of the Secret Trust.\r\n\r\nShe ascertained from old Mazey that it was his master\xe2\x80\x99s custom, during\r\nthe winter and spring months, to occupy the rooms in the north wing;\r\nand during the summer and autumn to cross the Arctic passage of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreeze-your-Bones,\xe2\x80\x9d and live in the eastward apartments which looked\r\nout on the garden. While the Banqueting-Hall remained\xe2\x80\x94owing to the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s inadequate pecuniary resources\xe2\x80\x94in its damp and dismantled\r\nstate, and while the interior of St. Crux was thus comfortlessly\r\ndivided into two separate residences, no more convenient arrangement\r\nthan this could well have been devised. Now and then (as Magdalen\r\nunderstood from her informant) there were days, both in winter and\r\nsummer, when the admiral became anxious about the condition of the\r\nrooms which he was not occupying at the time, and when he insisted on\r\ninvestigating the state of the furniture, the pictures, and the books\r\nwith his own eyes. On these occasions, in summer as in winter, a\r\nblazing fire was kindled for some days previously in the large grate,\r\nand the charcoal was lighted in the tripod-pan, to keep the\r\nBanqueting-Hall as warm as circumstances would admit. As soon as the\r\nold gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties were set at rest the rooms were shut up\r\nagain, and \xe2\x80\x9cFreeze-your-Bones\xe2\x80\x9d was once more abandoned for weeks and\r\nweeks together to damp, desolation, and decay. The last of these\r\ntemporary migrations had taken place only a few days since; the admiral\r\nhad satisfied himself that the rooms in the east wing were none the\r\nworse for the absence of their master, and he might now be safely\r\nreckoned on as settled in the north wing for weeks, and perhaps, if the\r\nseason was cold, for months to come.\r\n\r\nTrifling as they might be in themselves, these particulars were of\r\nserious importance to Magdalen, for they helped her to fix the limits\r\nof the field of search. Assuming that the admiral was likely to keep\r\nall his important documents within easy reach of his own hand, she\r\nmight now feel certain that the Secret Trust was secured in one or\r\nother of the rooms in the north wing.\r\n\r\nIn which room? That question was not easy to answer.\r\n\r\nOf the four inhabitable rooms which were all at the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s disposal\r\nduring the day\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, of the dining-room, the library, the\r\nmorning-room, and the drawing-room opening out of the vestibule\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlibrary appeared to be the apartment in which, if he had a preference,\r\nhe passed the greater part of his time. There was a table in this room,\r\nwith drawers that locked; there was a magnificent Italian cabinet, with\r\ndoors that locked; there were five cupboards under the book-cases,\r\nevery one of which locked. There were receptacles similarly secured in\r\nthe other rooms; and in all or any of these papers might be kept.\r\n\r\nShe had answered the bell, and had seen him locking and unlocking, now\r\nin one room, now in another, but oftenest in the library. She had\r\nnoticed occasionally that his expression was fretful and impatient when\r\nhe looked round at her from an open cabinet or cupboard and gave his\r\norders; and she inferred that something in connection with his papers\r\nand possessions\xe2\x80\x94it might or might not be the Secret Trust\xe2\x80\x94irritated and\r\nannoyed him from time to time. She had heard him more than once lock\r\nsomething up in one of the rooms, come out and go into another room,\r\nwait there a few minutes, then return to the first room with his keys\r\nin his hand, and sharply turn the locks and turn them again. This\r\nfidgety anxiety about his keys and his cupboards might be the result of\r\nthe inbred restlessness of his disposition, aggravated in a naturally\r\nactive man by the aimless indolence of a life in retirement\xe2\x80\x94a life\r\ndrifting backward and forward among trifles, with no regular employment\r\nto steady it at any given hour of the day. On the other hand, it was\r\njust as probable that these comings and goings, these lockings and\r\nunlockings, might be attributable to the existence of some private\r\nresponsibility which had unexpectedly intruded itself into the old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s easy existence, and which tormented him with a sense of\r\noppression new to the experience of his later years. Either one of\r\nthese interpretations might explain his conduct as reasonably and as\r\nprobably as the other. Which was the right interpretation of the two,\r\nit was, in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s position, impossible to say.\r\n\r\nThe one certain discovery at which she arrived was made in her first\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s observation of him. The admiral was a rigidly careful man with\r\nhis keys.\r\n\r\nAll the smaller keys he kept on a ring in the breast-pocket of his\r\ncoat. The larger he locked up together; generally, but not always, in\r\none of the drawers of the library table. Sometimes he left them secured\r\nin this way at night; sometimes he took them up to the bedroom with him\r\nin a little basket. He had no regular times for leaving them or for\r\ntaking them away with him; he had no discoverable reason for now\r\nsecuring them in the library-table drawer, and now again locking them\r\nup in some other place. The inveterate willfulness and caprice of his\r\nproceedings in these particulars defied every effort to reduce them to\r\na system, and baffled all attempts at calculating on them beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe hope of gaining positive information to act on, by laying artful\r\nsnares for him which he might fall into in his talk, proved, from the\r\noutset, to be utterly futile.\r\n\r\nIn Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s situation all experiments of this sort would have been in\r\nthe last degree difficult and dangerous with any man. With the admiral\r\nthey were simply impossible. His tendency to veer about from one\r\nsubject to another; his habit of keeping his tongue perpetually going,\r\nso long as there was anybody, no matter whom, within reach of the sound\r\nof his voice; his comical want of all dignity and reserve with his\r\nservants, promised, in appearance, much, and performed in reality\r\nnothing. No matter how diffidently or how respectfully Magdalen might\r\npresume on her master\xe2\x80\x99s example, and on her master\xe2\x80\x99s evident liking for\r\nher, the old man instantly discovered the advance she was making from\r\nher proper position, and instantly put her back in it again, with a\r\nquaint good humor which inflicted no pain, but with a blunt\r\nstraightforwardness of purpose which permitted no escape. Contradictory\r\nas it may sound, Admiral Bartram was too familiar to be approached; he\r\nkept the distance between himself and his servant more effectually than\r\nif he had been the proudest man in England. The systematic reserve of a\r\nsuperior toward an inferior may be occasionally overcome\xe2\x80\x94the systematic\r\nfamiliarity never.\r\n\r\nSlowly the time dragged on. The fourth week came; and Magdalen had made\r\nno new discoveries. The prospect was depressing in the last degree.\r\nEven in the apparently hopeless event of her devising a means of\r\ngetting at the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s keys, she could not count on retaining\r\npossession of them unsuspected more than a few hours\xe2\x80\x94hours which might\r\nbe utterly wasted through her not knowing in what direction to begin\r\nthe search. The Trust might be locked up in any one of some twenty\r\nreceptacles for papers, situated in four different rooms; and which\r\nroom was the likeliest to look in, which receptacle was the most\r\npromising to begin with, which position among other heaps of papers the\r\none paper needful might be expected to occupy, was more than she could\r\nsay. Hemmed in by immeasurable uncertainties on every side; condemned,\r\nas it were, to wander blindfold on the very brink of success, she\r\nwaited for the chance that never came, for the event that never\r\nhappened, with a patience which was sinking already into the patience\r\nof despair.\r\n\r\nNight after night she looked back over the vanished days, and not an\r\nevent rose on her memory to distinguish them one from the other. The\r\nonly interruptions to the weary uniformity of the life at St. Crux were\r\ncaused by the characteristic delinquencies of old Mazey and the dogs.\r\n\r\nAt certain intervals, the original wildness broke out in the natures of\r\nBrutus and Cassius. The modest comforts of home, the savory charms of\r\nmade dishes, the decorous joy of digestions accomplished on\r\nhearth-rugs, lost all their attractions, and the dogs ungratefully left\r\nthe house to seek dissipation and adventure in the outer world. On\r\nthese occasions the established after-dinner formula of question and\r\nanswer between old Mazey and his master varied a little in one\r\nparticular. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the Queen, Mazey,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the wind, Mazey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwere followed by a new inquiry: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the dogs, Mazey?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOut on\r\nthe loose, your honor, and be damned to \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d was the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunvarying answer. The admiral always sighed and shook his head gravely\r\nat the news, as if Brutus and Cassius had been sons of his own, who\r\ntreated him with a want of proper filial respect. In two or three days\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime the dogs always returned, lean, dirty, and heartily ashamed of\r\nthemselves. For the whole of the next day they were invariably tied up\r\nin disgrace. On the day after they were scrubbed clean, and were\r\nformally re-admitted to the dining-room. There, Civilization, acting\r\nthrough the subtle medium of the Saucepan, recovered its hold on them;\r\nand the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s two prodigal sons, when they saw the covers removed,\r\nwatered at the mouth as copiously as ever.\r\n\r\nOld Mazey, in his way, proved to be just as disreputably inclined on\r\ncertain occasions as the dogs. At intervals, the original wildness in\r\n_his_ nature broke out; he, too, lost all relish for the comforts of\r\nhome, and ungratefully left the house. He usually disappeared in the\r\nafternoon, and returned at night as drunk as liquor could make him. He\r\nwas by many degrees too seasoned a vessel to meet with any disasters on\r\nthese occasions. His wicked old legs might take roundabout methods of\r\nprogression, but they never failed him; his wicked old eyes might see\r\ndouble, but they always showed him the way home. Try as hard as they\r\nmight, the servants could never succeed in persuading him that he was\r\ndrunk; he always scorned the imputation. He even declined to admit the\r\nidea privately into his mind, until he had first tested his condition\r\nby an infallible criterion of his own.\r\n\r\nIt was his habit, in these cases of Bacchanalian emergency, to stagger\r\nobstinately into his room on the ground-floor, to take the model-ship\r\nout of the cupboard, and to try if he could proceed with the\r\nnever-to-be-completed employment of setting up the rigging. When he had\r\nsmashed the tiny spars, and snapped asunder the delicate ropes\xe2\x80\x94then,\r\nand not till then, the veteran admitted facts as they were, on the\r\nauthority of practical evidence. \xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay!\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say\r\nconfidentially to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe women are right. Drunk again,\r\nMazey\xe2\x80\x94drunk again!\xe2\x80\x9d Having reached this discovery, it was his habit to\r\nwait cunningly in the lower regions until the admiral was safe in his\r\nroom, and then to ascend in discreet list slippers to his post. Too\r\nwary to attempt getting into the truckle-bed (which would have been\r\nonly inviting the catastrophe of a fall against his master\xe2\x80\x99s door), he\r\nalways walked himself sober up and down the passage. More than once\r\nMagdalen had peeped round the screen, and had seen the old sailor\r\nunsteadily keeping his watch, and fancying himself once more at his\r\nduty on board ship. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an uncommonly lively vessel in a sea-way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe used to mutter under his breath, when his legs took him down the\r\npassage in zigzag directions, or left him for the moment studying the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPints of the Compass\xe2\x80\x9d on his own system, with his back against the\r\nwall. \xe2\x80\x9cA nasty night, mind you,\xe2\x80\x9d he would maunder on, taking another\r\nturn. \xe2\x80\x9cAs dark as your pocket, and the wind heading us again from the\r\nold quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d On the next day old Mazey, like the dogs, was kept\r\ndownstairs in disgrace. On the day after, like the dogs again, he was\r\nreinstated in his privileges; and another change was introduced in the\r\nafter-dinner formula. On entering the room, the old sailor stopped\r\nshort and made his excuses in this brief yet comprehensive form of\r\nwords, with his back against the door: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease your honor, I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed\r\nof myself.\xe2\x80\x9d So the apology began and ended. \xe2\x80\x9cThis mustn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again,\r\nMazey,\xe2\x80\x9d the admiral used to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shan\xe2\x80\x99t happen again, your\r\nhonor.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Come here, and drink your glass of wine. God bless\r\nthe Queen, Mazey.\xe2\x80\x9d The veteran tossed off his port, and the dialogue\r\nended as usual.\r\n\r\nSo the days passed, with no incidents more important than these to\r\nrelieve their monotony, until the end of the fourth week was at hand.\r\n\r\nOn the last day, an event happened; on the last day, the long deferred\r\npromise of the future unexpectedly began to dawn. While Magdalen was\r\nspreading the cloth in the dining-room, as usual, Mrs. Drake looked in,\r\nand instructed her on this occasion, for the first time, to lay the\r\ntable for two persons. The admiral had received a letter from his\r\nnephew. Early that evening Mr. George Bartram was expected to return to\r\nSt. Crux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAfter placing the second cover, Magdalen awaited the ringing of the\r\ndinner-bell, with an interest and impatience which she found it no easy\r\ntask to conceal. The return of Mr. Bartram would, in all probability,\r\nproduce a change in the life of the house; and from change of any kind,\r\nno matter how trifling, something might be hoped. The nephew might be\r\naccessible to influences which had failed to reach the uncle. In any\r\ncase, the two would talk of their affairs over their dinner; and\r\nthrough that talk\xe2\x80\x94proceeding day after day in her presence\xe2\x80\x94the way to\r\ndiscovery, now absolutely invisible, might, sooner or later, show\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAt last the bell rang, the door opened, and the two gentlemen entered\r\nthe room together.\r\n\r\nMagdalen was struck, as her sister had been struck, by George Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresemblance to her father\xe2\x80\x94judging by the portrait at Combe-Raven, which\r\npresented the likeness of Andrew Vanstone in his younger days. The\r\nlight hair and florid complexion, the bright blue eyes and hardy\r\nupright figure, familiar to her in the picture, were all recalled to\r\nher memory, as the nephew followed the uncle across the room and took\r\nhis place at table. She was not prepared for this sudden revival of the\r\nlost associations of home. Her attention wandered as she tried to\r\nconceal its effect on her; and she made a blunder in waiting at table,\r\nfor the first time since she had entered the house.\r\n\r\nA quaint reprimand from the admiral, half in jest, half in earnest,\r\ngave her time to recover herself. She ventured another look at George\r\nBartram. The impression which he produced on her this time roused her\r\ncuriosity immediately. His face and manner plainly expressed anxiety\r\nand preoccupation of mind. He looked oftener at his plate than at his\r\nuncle, and at Magdalen herself (except one passing inspection of the\r\nnew parlor-maid, when the admiral spoke to her) he never looked at all.\r\nSome uncertainty was evidently troubling his thoughts; some oppression\r\nwas weighing on his natural freedom of manner. What uncertainty? what\r\noppression? Would any personal revelations come out, little by little,\r\nin the course of conversation at the dinner-table?\r\n\r\nNo. One set of dishes followed another set of dishes, and nothing in\r\nthe shape of a personal revelation took place. The conversation halted\r\non irregularly, between public affairs on one side and trifling private\r\ntopics on the other. Politics, home and foreign, took their turn with\r\nthe small household history of St. Crux; the leaders of the revolution\r\nwhich expelled Louis Philippe from the throne of France marched side by\r\nside, in the dinner-table review, with old Mazey and the dogs. The\r\ndessert was put on the table, the old sailor came in, drank his loyal\r\ntoast, paid his respects to \xe2\x80\x9cMaster George,\xe2\x80\x9d and went out again.\r\nMagdalen followed him, on her way back to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 offices, having\r\nheard nothing in the conversation of the slightest importance to the\r\nfurtherance of her own design, from the first word of it to the last.\r\nShe struggled hard not to lose heart and hope on the first day. They\r\ncould hardly talk again to-morrow, they could hardly talk again the\r\nnext day, of the French Revolution and the dogs. Time might do wonders\r\nyet; and time was all her own.\r\n\r\nLeft together over their wine, the uncle and nephew drew their\r\neasy-chairs on either side of the fire; and, in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s absence,\r\nbegan the very conversation which it was Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s interest to hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClaret, George?\xe2\x80\x9d said the admiral, pushing the bottle across the\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look out of spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a little anxious, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied George, leaving his glass empty,\r\nand looking straight into the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the admiral. \xe2\x80\x9cI am more than a little\r\nanxious myself, I can tell you. Here we are at the last days of\r\nMarch\xe2\x80\x94and nothing done! Your time comes to an end on the third of May;\r\nand there you sit, as if you had years still before you, to turn round\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge smiled, and resignedly helped himself to some wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I really to understand, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are serious in\r\nwhat you said to me last November? Are you actually resolved to bind me\r\nto that incomprehensible condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t call it incomprehensible,\xe2\x80\x9d said the admiral, irritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you, sir? I am to inherit your estate, unconditionally\xe2\x80\x94as you\r\nhave generously settled it from the first. But I am not to touch a\r\nfarthing of the fortune poor Noel left you unless I am married within a\r\ncertain time. The house and lands are to be mine (thanks to your\r\nkindness) under any circumstances. But the money with which I might\r\nimprove them both is to be arbitrarily taken away from me, if I am not\r\na married man on the third of May. I am sadly wanting in intelligence,\r\nI dare say, but a more incomprehensible proceeding I never heard of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo snapping and snarling, George! Say your say out. We don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand sneering in Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Navy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean no offense, sir. But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to astonish me\r\nby a change of proceeding on your part, entirely foreign to my\r\nexperience of your character\xe2\x80\x94and then, when I naturally ask for an\r\nexplanation, to turn round coolly and leave me in the dark. If you and\r\nNoel came to some private arrangement together before he made his will,\r\nwhy not tell me? Why set up a mystery between us, where no mystery need\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have it, George!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the admiral, angrily drumming on the\r\ntable with the nutcrackers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are trying to draw me like a badger,\r\nbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t be drawn! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make any conditions I please; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\naccountable to nobody for them unless I like. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite bad enough to\r\nhave worries and responsibilities laid on my unlucky shoulders that I\r\nnever bargained for\xe2\x80\x94never mind what worries: they\xe2\x80\x99re not yours, they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x94without being questioned and cross-questioned as if I was a\r\nwitness in a box. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the admiral,\r\napostrophizing his nephew in red-hot irritation, and addressing himself\r\nto the dogs on the hearth-rug for want of a better audience. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npretty fellow? He is asked to help himself to two uncommonly\r\ncomfortable things in their way\xe2\x80\x94a fortune and a wife; he is allowed six\r\nmonths to get the wife in (we should have got her, in the Navy, bag and\r\nbaggage, in six days); he has a round dozen of nice girls, to my\r\ncertain knowledge, in one part of the country and another, all at his\r\ndisposal to choose from, and what does he do? He sits month after\r\nmonth, with his lazy legs crossed before him; he leaves the girls to\r\npine on the stem, and he bothers his uncle to know the reason why! I\r\npity the poor unfortunate women. Men were made of flesh and blood, and\r\nplenty of it, too, in my time. They\xe2\x80\x99re made of machinery now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only repeat, sir, I am sorry to have offended you,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh! you needn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me in that languishing way if you\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the admiral. \xe2\x80\x9cStick to your wine, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you.\r\nYour good health, George. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you again at St. Crux. Look\r\nat that plateful of sponge-cakes! The cook has sent them up in honor of\r\nyour return. We can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her feelings, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t spoil our wine.\r\nHere!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The admiral tossed four sponge-cakes in quick succession down\r\nthe accommodating throats of the dogs. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, George,\xe2\x80\x9d the old\r\ngentleman gravely proceeded; \xe2\x80\x9cI am really sorry you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got your\r\neye on one of those nice girls. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a loss you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ninflicting on yourself; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what trouble and mortification\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re causing me by this shilly-shally conduct of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would only allow me to explain myself, sir, you would view my\r\nconduct in a totally different light. I am ready to marry to-morrow, if\r\nthe lady will have me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil you are! So you have got a lady in your eye, after all? Why\r\nin Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me so before? Never mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nforgive you everything, now I know you have laid your hand on a wife.\r\nFill your glass again. Here\xe2\x80\x99s her health in a bumper. By-the-by, who is\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you directly, admiral. When we began this conversation, I\r\nmentioned that I was a little anxious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not one of my round dozen of nice girls\xe2\x80\x94aha, Master George, I\r\nsee that in your face already! Why are you anxious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you will disapprove of my choice, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t beat about the bush! How the deuce can I say whether I\r\ndisapprove or not, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me who she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the eldest daughter of Andrew Vanstone, of Combe-Raven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vanstone, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe admiral put down his glass of wine untasted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, George,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI do disapprove of your choice\r\n\xe2\x80\x94strongly disapprove of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it the misfortune of her birth, sir, that you object to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid! the misfortune of her birth is not her fault, poor thing.\r\nYou know as well as I do, George, what I object to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou object to her sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! The most liberal man alive might object to her sister, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard, sir, to make Miss Vanstone suffer for her sister\xe2\x80\x99s faults.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Faults_, do you call them? You have a mighty convenient memory,\r\nGeorge, when your own interests are concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall them crimes if you like, sir\xe2\x80\x94I say again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard on Miss\r\nVanstone. Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s life is pure of all reproach. From first to\r\nlast she has borne her hard lot with such patience, and sweetness, and\r\ncourage as not one woman in a thousand would have shown in her place.\r\nAsk Miss Garth, who has known her from childhood. Ask Mrs. Tyrrel, who\r\nblesses the day when she came into the house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk a fiddlestick\xe2\x80\x99s end! I beg your pardon, George, but you are enough\r\nto try the patience of a saint. My good fellow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny Miss\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x99s virtues. I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit, if you like, she\xe2\x80\x99s the best woman that\r\never put on a petticoat. That is not the question\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, admiral\xe2\x80\x94it _is_ the question, if she is to be my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me out, George; look at it from my point of view, as well as your\r\nown. What did your cousin Noel do? Your cousin Noel fell a victim, poor\r\nfellow, to one of the vilest conspiracies I ever heard of, and the\r\nprime mover of that conspiracy was Miss Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s damnable sister. She\r\ndeceived him in the most infamous manner; and as soon as she was down\r\nfor a handsome legacy in his will, she had the poison ready to take his\r\nlife. This is the truth; we know it from Mrs. Lecount, who found the\r\nbottle locked up in her own room. If you marry Miss Vanstone, you make\r\nthis wretch your sister-in-law. She becomes a member of our family. All\r\nthe disgrace of what she has done; all the disgrace of what she _may_\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94and the Devil, who possesses her, only knows what lengths she may go\r\nto next\xe2\x80\x94becomes _our_ disgrace. Good heavens, George, consider what a\r\nposition that is! Consider what pitch you touch, if you make this woman\r\nyour sister-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have put your side of the question, admiral,\xe2\x80\x9d said George\r\nresolutely; \xe2\x80\x9cnow let me put mine. A certain impression is produced on\r\nme by a young lady whom I meet with under very interesting\r\ncircumstances. I don\xe2\x80\x99t act headlong on that impression, as I might have\r\ndone if I had been some years younger; I wait, and put it to the trial.\r\nEvery time I see this young lady the impression strengthens; her beauty\r\ngrows on me, her character grows on me; when I am away from her, I am\r\nrestless and dissatisfied; when I am with her, I am the happiest man\r\nalive. All I hear of her conduct from those who know her best more than\r\nconfirms the high opinion I have formed of her. The one drawback I can\r\ndiscover is caused by a misfortune for which she is not responsible\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmisfortune of having a sister who is utterly unworthy of her. Does this\r\ndiscovery\xe2\x80\x94an unpleasant discovery, I grant you\xe2\x80\x94destroy all those good\r\nqualities in Miss Vanstone for which I love and admire her? Nothing of\r\nthe sort\xe2\x80\x94it only makes her good qualities all the more precious to me\r\nby contrast. If I am to have a drawback to contend with\xe2\x80\x94and who expects\r\nanything else in this world?\xe2\x80\x94I would infinitely rather have the\r\ndrawback attached to my wife\xe2\x80\x99s sister than to my wife. My wife\xe2\x80\x99s sister\r\nis not essential to my happiness, but my wife is. In my opinion, sir,\r\nMrs. Noel Vanstone has done mischief enough already. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the\r\nnecessity of letting her do more mischief, by depriving me of a good\r\nwife. Right or wrong, that is my point of view. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to trouble\r\nyou with any questions of sentiment. All I wish to say is that I am old\r\nenough by this time to know my own mind, and that my mind is made up.\r\nIf my marriage is essential to the execution of your intentions on my\r\nbehalf, there is only one woman in the world whom I _can_ marry, and\r\nthat woman is Miss Vanstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting this plain declaration. Admiral Bartram rose\r\nfrom his chair without making any reply, and walked perturbedly up and\r\ndown the room.\r\n\r\nThe situation was emphatically a serious one. Mrs. Girdlestone\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nhad already produced the failure of one of the two objects contemplated\r\nby the Secret Trust. If the third of May arrived and found George a\r\nsingle man, the second (and last) of the objects would then have failed\r\nin its turn. In little more than a fortnight, at the very latest, the\r\nBanns must be published in Ossory church, or the time would fail for\r\ncompliance with one of the stipulations insisted on in the Trust.\r\nObstinate as the admiral was by nature, strongly as he felt the\r\nobjections which attached to his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s contemplated alliance, he\r\nrecoiled in spite of himself, as he paced the room and saw the facts on\r\neither side immovably staring him in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you engaged to Miss Vanstone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied George. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it due to your uniform kindness\r\nto me to speak to you on the subject first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch obliged, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. And you have put off speaking to me to the\r\nlast moment, just as you put off everything else. Do you think Miss\r\nVanstone will say yes when you ask her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take your modesty!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the admiral. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a time\r\nfor modesty; this is a time for speaking out. Will she or won\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she will, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe admiral laughed sardonically, and took another turn in the room. He\r\nsuddenly stopped, put his hands in his pockets, and stood still in a\r\ncorner, deep in thought. After an interval of a few minutes, his face\r\ncleared a little; it brightened with the dawning of a new idea. He\r\nwalked round briskly to George\xe2\x80\x99s side of the fire, and laid his hand\r\nkindly on his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wrong, George,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is too late now to set you\r\nright. On the sixteenth of next month the Banns must be put up in\r\nOssory church, or you will lose the money. Have you told Miss Vanstone\r\nthe position you stand in? Or have you put that off to the eleventh\r\nhour, like everything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe position is so extraordinary, sir, and it might lead to so much\r\nmisapprehension of my motives, that I have felt unwilling to allude to\r\nit. I hardly know how I can tell her of it at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry the experiment of telling her friends. Let them know it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nquestion of money, and they will overcome her scruples, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nBut that is not what I had to say to you. How long do you propose\r\nstopping here this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of staying a few days, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then of going back to London and making your offer, I suppose?\r\nWill a week give you time enough to pick your opportunity with Miss\r\nVanstone\xe2\x80\x94a week out of the fortnight or so that you have to spare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will stay here a week, admiral, with pleasure, if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it. I want you to pack up your traps and be off\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge looked at his uncle in silent astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou found some letters waiting for you when you got here,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded\r\nthe admiral. \xe2\x80\x9cWas one of those letters from my old friend, Sir Franklin\r\nBrock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it an invitation to you to go and stay at the Grange?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once, if I could manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I want you to manage it; I want you to start for the Grange\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge looked back at the fire, and sighed impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you now, admiral,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are entirely mistaken in\r\nme. My attachment to Miss Vanstone is not to be shaken in _that_\r\nmanner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdmiral Bartram took his quarter-deck walk again, up and down the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne good turn deserves another, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nam willing to make concessions on my side, the least you can do is to\r\nmeet me half-way, and make concessions on yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Now listen to my proposal. Give me a fair hearing, George\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfair hearing is every man\xe2\x80\x99s privilege. I will be perfectly just to\r\nbegin with. I won\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny that you honestly believe Miss\r\nVanstone is the only woman in the world who can make you happy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquestion that. What I do question is, whether you really know your own\r\nmind in this matter quite so well as you think you know it yourself.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t deny, George, that you have been in love with a good many\r\nwomen in your time? Among the rest of them, you have been in love with\r\nMiss Brock. No longer ago than this time last year there was a sneaking\r\nkindness between you and that young lady, to say the least of it. And\r\nquite right, too! Miss Brock is one of that round dozen of darlings I\r\nmentioned over our first glass of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are confusing an idle flirtation, sir, with a serious attachment,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid George. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are altogether mistaken\xe2\x80\x94you are, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikely enough; I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be infallible\xe2\x80\x94I leave that to my\r\njuniors. But I happen to have known you, George, since you were the\r\nheight of my old telescope; and I want to have this serious attachment\r\nof yours put to the test. If you can satisfy me that your whole heart\r\nand soul are as strongly set on Miss Vanstone as you suppose them to\r\nbe, I must knock under to necessity, and keep my objections to myself.\r\nBut I _must_ be satisfied first. Go to the Grange to-morrow, and stay\r\nthere a week in Miss Brock\xe2\x80\x99s society. Give that charming girl a fair\r\nchance of lighting up the old flame again if she can, and then come\r\nback to St. Crux, and let me hear the result. If you tell me, as an\r\nhonest man, that your attachment to Miss Vanstone still remains\r\nunshaken, you will have heard the last of my objections from that\r\nmoment. Whatever misgivings I may feel in my own mind, I will say\r\nnothing, and do nothing, adverse to your wishes. There is my proposal.\r\nI dare say it looks like an old man\xe2\x80\x99s folly, in your eyes. But the old\r\nman won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you much longer, George; and it may be a pleasant\r\nreflection, when you have got sons of your own, to remember that you\r\nhumored him in his last days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came back to the fire-place as he said those words, and laid his\r\nhand once more on his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. George took the hand and\r\npressed it affectionately. In the tenderest and best sense of the word,\r\nhis uncle had been a father to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do what you ask me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cif you seriously wish\r\nit. But it is only right to tell you that the experiment will be\r\nperfectly useless. However, if you prefer my passing a week at the\r\nGrange to my passing it here, to the Grange I will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said the admiral, bluntly. \xe2\x80\x9cI expected as much\r\nfrom you, and you have not disappointed me.\xe2\x80\x94If Miss Brock doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nus out of this mess,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the wily old gentleman, as he resumed his\r\nplace at the table, \xe2\x80\x9cmy nephew\xe2\x80\x99s weather-cock of a head has turned\r\nsteady with a vengeance!\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll consider the question settled for\r\nto-night, George,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cand call another subject.\r\nThese family anxieties don\xe2\x80\x99t improve the flavor of my old claret. The\r\nbottle stands with you. What are they doing at the theaters in London?\r\nWe always patronized the theaters, in my time, in the Navy. We used to\r\nlike a good tragedy to begin with, and a hornpipe to cheer us up at the\r\nend of the entertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the evening, the talk flowed in the ordinary channels.\r\nAdmiral Bartram only returned to the forbidden subject when he and his\r\nnephew parted for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t forget to-morrow, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the dog-cart, and drive myself over\r\nafter breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore noon the next day Mr. George Bartram had left the house, and the\r\nlast chance in Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s favor had left it with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWhen the servants\xe2\x80\x99 dinner-bell at St. Crux rang as usual on the day of\r\nGeorge Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s departure, it was remarked that the new parlor-maid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace at table remained empty. One of the inferior servants was sent to\r\nher room to make inquiries, and returned with the information that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa\xe2\x80\x9d felt a little faint, and begged that her attendance at table\r\nmight be excused for that day. Upon this, the superior authority of the\r\nhousekeeper was invoked, and Mrs. Drake went upstairs immediately to\r\nascertain the truth for herself. Her first look of inquiry satisfied\r\nher that the parlor-maid\xe2\x80\x99s indisposition, whatever the cause of it\r\nmight be, was certainly not assumed to serve any idle or sullen purpose\r\nof her own. She respectfully declined taking any of the remedies which\r\nthe housekeeper offered, and merely requested permission to try the\r\nefficacy of a walk in the fresh air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been accustomed to more exercise, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, than I take here,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cMight I go into the garden, and try what the air will do for\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Can you walk by yourself, or shall I send some one with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go by myself, if you please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Put on your bonnet and shawl, and, when you get out, keep\r\nin the east garden. The admiral sometimes walks in the north garden,\r\nand he might feel surprised at seeing you there. Come to my room, when\r\nyou have had air and exercise enough, and let me see how you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more Magdalen was out in the east garden. The sky was\r\nclear and sunny; but the cold shadow of the house rested on the garden\r\nwalk and chilled the midday air. She walked toward the ruins of the old\r\nmonastery, situated on the south side of the more modern range of\r\nbuildings. Here there were lonely open spaces to breathe in freely;\r\nhere the pale March sunshine stole through the gaps of desolation and\r\ndecay, and met her invitingly with the genial promise of spring.\r\n\r\nShe ascended three or four riven stone steps, and seated herself on\r\nsome ruined fragments beyond them, full in the sunshine. The place she\r\nhad chosen had once been the entrance to the church. In centuries long\r\ngone by, the stream of human sin and human suffering had flowed, day\r\nafter day, to the confessional, over the place where she now sat. Of\r\nall the miserable women who had trodden those old stones in the bygone\r\ntime, no more miserable creature had touched them than the woman whose\r\nfeet rested on them now.\r\n\r\nHer hands trembled as she placed them on either side of her, to support\r\nherself on the stone seat. She laid them on her lap; they trembled\r\nthere. She held them out, and looked at them wonderingly; they trembled\r\nas she looked. \xe2\x80\x9cLike an old woman!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly, and let them\r\ndrop again at her side.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, that morning, the cruel discovery had forced itself\r\non her mind\xe2\x80\x94the discovery that her strength was failing her, at the\r\ntime when she had most confidently trusted to it, at the time when she\r\nwanted it most. She had felt the surprise of Mr. Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected\r\ndeparture, as if it had been the shock of the severest calamity that\r\ncould have befallen her. That one check to her hopes\xe2\x80\x94a check which at\r\nother times would only have roused the resisting power in her to new\r\nefforts\xe2\x80\x94had struck her with as suffocating a terror, had prostrated her\r\nwith as all-mastering a despair, as if she had been overwhelmed by the\r\ncrowning disaster of expulsion from St. Crux. But one warning could be\r\nread in such a change as this. Into the space of little more than a\r\nyear she had crowded the wearing and wasting emotions of a life. The\r\nbountiful gifts of health and strength, so prodigally heaped on her by\r\nNature, so long abused with impunity, were failing her at last.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at the far faint blue of the sky. She heard the joyous\r\nsinging of birds among the ivy that clothed the ruins. Oh the cold\r\ndistance of the heavens! Oh the pitiless happiness of the birds! Oh the\r\nlonely horror of sitting there, and feeling old and weak and worn, in\r\nthe heyday of her youth! She rose with a last effort of resolution, and\r\ntried to keep back the hysterical passion swelling at her heart by\r\nmoving and looking about her. Rapidly and more rapidly she walked to\r\nand fro in the sunshine. The exercise helped her, through the very\r\nfatigue that she felt from it. She forced the rising tears desperately\r\nback to their sources; she fought with the clinging pain, and wrenched\r\nit from its hold. Little by little her mind began to clear again: the\r\ndespairing fear of herself grew less vividly present to her thoughts.\r\nThere were reserves of youth and strength in her still to be wasted;\r\nthere was a spirit sorely wounded, but not yet subdued.\r\n\r\nShe gradually extended the limits of her walk; she gradually recovered\r\nthe exercise of her observation.\r\n\r\nAt the western extremity the remains of the monastery were in a less\r\nruinous condition than at the eastern. In certain places, where the\r\nstout old walls still stood, repairs had been made at some former time.\r\nRoofs of red tile had been laid roughly over four of the ancient cells;\r\nwooden doors had been added; and the old monastic chambers had been\r\nused as sheds to hold the multifarious lumber of St. Crux. No padlocks\r\nguarded any of the doors. Magdalen had only to push them to let the\r\ndaylight in on the litter inside. She resolved to investigate the sheds\r\none after the other\xe2\x80\x94not from curiosity, not with the idea of making\r\ndiscoveries of any sort. Her only object was to fill up the vacant\r\ntime, and to keep the thoughts that unnerved her from returning to her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe first shed she opened contained the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s utensils, large and\r\nsmall. The second was littered with fragments of broken furniture,\r\nempty picture-frames of worm-eaten wood, shattered vases, boxes without\r\ncovers, and books torn from their bindings. As Magdalen turned to leave\r\nthe shed, after one careless glance round her at the lumber that it\r\ncontained, her foot struck something on the ground which tinkled\r\nagainst a fragment of china lying near it. She stooped, and discovered\r\nthat the tinkling substance was a rusty key.\r\n\r\nShe picked up the key and looked at it. She walked out into the air,\r\nand considered a little. More old forgotten keys were probably lying\r\nabout among the lumber in the sheds. What if she collected all she\r\ncould find, and tried them, one after another, in the locks of the\r\ncabinets and cupboards now closed against her? Was there chance enough\r\nthat any one of them might fit to justify her in venturing on the\r\nexperiment? If the locks at St. Crux were as old-fashioned as the\r\nfurniture\xe2\x80\x94if there were no protective niceties of modern invention to\r\ncontend against\xe2\x80\x94there was chance enough beyond all question. Who could\r\nsay whether the very key in her hand might not be the lost duplicate of\r\none of the keys on the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s bunch? In the dearth of all other\r\nmeans of finding the way to her end, the risk was worth running. A\r\nflash of the old spirit sparkled in her weary eyes as she turned and\r\nre-entered the shed.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour more brought her to the limits of the time which she could\r\nventure to allow herself in the open air. In that interval she had\r\nsearched the sheds from first to last, and had found five more keys.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive more chances!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself, as she hid the keys, and\r\nhastily returned to the house.\r\n\r\nAfter first reporting herself in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room, she went\r\nupstairs to remove her bonnet and shawl; taking that opportunity to\r\nhide the keys in her bed-chamber until night came. They were crusted\r\nthick with rust and dirt; but she dared not attempt to clean them until\r\nbed-time secluded her from the prying eyes of the servants in the\r\nsolitude of her room.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner hour brought her, as usual, into personal contact with\r\nthe admiral, she was at once struck by a change in him. For the first\r\ntime in her experience the old gentleman was silent and depressed. He\r\nate less than usual, and he hardly said five words to her from the\r\nbeginning of the meal to the end. Some unwelcome subject of reflection\r\nhad evidently fixed itself on his mind, and remained there\r\npersistently, in spite of his efforts to shake it off. At intervals\r\nthrough the evening, she wondered with an ever-growing perplexity what\r\nthe subject could be.\r\n\r\nAt last the lagging hours reached their end, and bed-time came. Before\r\nshe slept that night Magdalen had cleaned the keys from all impurities,\r\nand had oiled the wards, to help them smoothly into the locks. The last\r\ndifficulty that remained was the difficulty of choosing the time when\r\nthe experiment might be tried with the least risk of interruption and\r\ndiscovery. After carefully considering the question overnight, Magdalen\r\ncould only resolve to wait and be guided by the events of the next day.\r\n\r\nThe morning came, and for the first time at St. Crux events justified\r\nthe trust she had placed in them. The morning came, and the one\r\nremaining difficulty that perplexed her was unexpectedly smoothed away\r\nby no less a person than the admiral himself! To the surprise of every\r\none in the house, he announced at breakfast that he had arranged to\r\nstart for London in an hour; that he should pass the night in town; and\r\nthat he might be expected to return to St. Crux in time for dinner on\r\nthe next day. He volunteered no further explanations to the housekeeper\r\nor to any one else, but it was easy to see that his errand to London\r\nwas of no ordinary importance in his own estimation. He swallowed his\r\nbreakfast in a violent hurry, and he was impatiently ready for the\r\ncarriage before it came to the door.\r\n\r\nExperience had taught Magdalen to be cautious. She waited a little,\r\nafter Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s departure, before she ventured on trying her\r\nexperiment with the keys. It was well she did so. Mrs. Drake took\r\nadvantage of the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s absence to review the condition of the\r\napartments on the first floor. The results of the investigation by no\r\nmeans satisfied her; brooms and dusters were set to work; and the\r\nhouse-maids were in and out of the rooms perpetually, as long as the\r\ndaylight lasted.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed, and still the safe opportunity for which Magdalen\r\nwas on the watch never presented itself. Bed-time came again, and found\r\nher placed between the two alternatives of trusting to the doubtful\r\nchances of the next morning, or of trying the keys boldly in the dead\r\nof night. In former times she would have made her choice without\r\nhesitation. She hesitated now; but the wreck of her old courage still\r\nsustained her, and she determined to make the venture at night.\r\n\r\nThey kept early hours at St. Crux. If she waited in her room until\r\nhalf-past eleven, she would wait long enough. At that time she stole\r\nout on to the staircase, with the keys in her pocket, and the candle in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nOn passing the entrance to the corridor on the bedroom floor, she\r\nstopped and listened. No sound of snoring, no shuffling of infirm\r\nfootsteps was to be heard on the other side of the screen. She looked\r\nround it distrustfully. The stone passage was a solitude, and the\r\ntruckle-bed was empty. Her own eyes had shown her old Mazey on his way\r\nto the upper regions, more than an hour since, with a candle in his\r\nhand. Had he taken advantage of his master\xe2\x80\x99s absence to enjoy the\r\nunaccustomed luxury of sleeping in a room? As the thought occurred to\r\nher, a sound from the further end of the corridor just caught her ear.\r\nShe softly advanced toward it, and heard through the door of the last\r\nand remotest of the spare bed-chambers the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s lusty snoring in\r\nthe room inside. The discovery was startling, in more senses than one.\r\nIt deepened the impenetrable mystery of the truckle-bed; for it showed\r\nplainly that old Mazey had no barbarous preference of his own for\r\npassing his nights in the corridor; he occupied that strange and\r\ncomfortless sleeping-place purely and entirely on his master\xe2\x80\x99s account.\r\n\r\nIt was no time for dwelling on the reflections which this conclusion\r\nmight suggest. Magdalen retraced her steps along the passage, and\r\ndescended to the first floor. Passing the doors nearest to her, she\r\ntried the library first. On the staircase and in the corridors she had\r\nfelt her heart throbbing fast with an unutterable fear; but a sense of\r\nsecurity returned to her when she found herself within the four walls\r\nof the room, and when she had closed the door on the ghostly quiet\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nThe first lock she tried was the lock of the table-drawer. None of the\r\nkeys fitted it. Her next experiment was made on the cabinet. Would the\r\nsecond attempt fail, like the first?\r\n\r\nNo! One of the keys fitted; one of the keys, with a little patient\r\nmanagement, turned the lock. She looked in eagerly. There were open\r\nshelves above, and one long drawer under them. The shelves were devoted\r\nto specimens of curious minerals, neatly labeled and arranged. The\r\ndrawer was divided into compartments. Two of the compartments contained\r\npapers. In the first, she discovered nothing but a collection of\r\nreceipted bills. In the second, she found a heap of business documents;\r\nbut the writing, yellow with age, was enough of itself to warn her that\r\nthe Trust was not there. She shut the doors of the cabinet, and, after\r\nlocking them again with some little difficulty, proceeded to try the\r\nkeys in the bookcase cupboards next, before she continued her\r\ninvestigations in the other rooms.\r\n\r\nThe bookcase cupboards were unassailable, the drawers and cupboards in\r\nall the other rooms were unassailable. One after another she tried them\r\npatiently in regular succession. It was useless. The chance which the\r\ncabinet in the library had offered in her favor was the first chance\r\nand the last.\r\n\r\nShe went back to her room, seeing nothing but her own gliding shadow,\r\nhearing nothing but her own stealthy footfall in the midnight stillness\r\nof the house. After mechanically putting the keys away in their former\r\nhiding-place, she looked toward her bed, and turned away from it,\r\nshuddering. The warning remembrance of what she had suffered that\r\nmorning in the garden was vividly present to her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother chance\r\ntried,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cand another chance lost! I shall break\r\ndown again if I think of it; and I shall think of it if I lie awake in\r\nthe dark.\xe2\x80\x9d She had brought a work-box with her to St. Crux, as one of\r\nthe many little things which in her character of a servant it was\r\ndesirable to possess; and she now opened the box and applied herself\r\nresolutely to work. Her want of dexterity with her needle assisted the\r\nobject she had in view; it obliged her to pay the closest attention to\r\nher employment; it forced her thoughts away from the two subjects of\r\nall others which she now dreaded most\xe2\x80\x94herself and the future.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as he had arranged, the admiral returned. His visit to\r\nLondon had not improved his spirits. The shadow of some unconquerable\r\ndoubt still clouded his face; his restless tongue was strangely quiet,\r\nwhile Magdalen waited on him at his solitary meal. That night the\r\nsnoring resounded once more on the inner side of the screen, and old\r\nMazey was back again in the comfortless truckle-bed.\r\n\r\nThree more days passed\xe2\x80\x94April came. On the second of the month\r\n\xe2\x80\x94returning as unexpectedly as he had departed a week before\xe2\x80\x94Mr. George\r\nBartram re-appeared at St. Crux.\r\n\r\nHe came back early in the afternoon, and had an interview with his\r\nuncle in the library. The interview over, he left the house again, and\r\nwas driven to the railway by the groom in time to catch the last train\r\nto London that night. The groom noticed, on the road, that \xe2\x80\x9cMr. George\r\nseemed to be rather pleased than otherwise at leaving St. Crux.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nalso remarked, on his return, that the admiral swore at him for\r\noverdriving the horses\xe2\x80\x94an indication of ill-temper, on the part of his\r\nmaster, which he described as being entirely without precedent in all\r\nhis former experience. Magdalen, in her department of service, had\r\nsuffered in like manner under the old man\xe2\x80\x99s irritable humor: he had\r\nbeen dissatisfied with everything she did in the dining-room; and he\r\nhad found fault with all the dishes, one after another, from the\r\nmutton-broth to the toasted cheese.\r\n\r\nThe next two days passed as usual. On the third day an event happened.\r\nIn appearance, it was nothing more important than a ring at the\r\ndrawing-room bell. In reality, it was the forerunner of approaching\r\ncatastrophe\xe2\x80\x94the formidable herald of the end.\r\n\r\nIt was Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s business to answer the bell. On reaching the\r\ndrawing-room door, she knocked as usual. There was no reply. After\r\nagain knocking, and again receiving no answer, she ventured into the\r\nroom, and was instantly met by a current of cold air flowing full on\r\nher face. The heavy sliding door in the opposite wall was pushed back,\r\nand the Arctic atmosphere of Freeze-your-Bones was pouring unhindered\r\ninto the empty room.\r\n\r\nShe waited near the door, doubtful what to do next; it was certainly\r\nthe drawing-room bell that had rung, and no other. She waited, looking\r\nthrough the open doorway opposite, down the wilderness of the\r\ndismantled Hall.\r\n\r\nA little consideration satisfied her that it would be best to go\r\ndownstairs again, and wait there for a second summons from the bell. On\r\nturning to leave the room, she happened to look back once more, and\r\nexactly at that moment she saw the door open at the opposite extremity\r\nof the Banqueting-Hall\xe2\x80\x94the door leading into the first of the\r\napartments in the east wing. A tall man came out, wearing his great\r\ncoat and his hat, and rapidly approached the drawing-room. His gait\r\nbetrayed him, while he was still too far off for his features to be\r\nseen. Before he was quite half-way across the Hall, Magdalen had\r\nrecognized\xe2\x80\x94the admiral.\r\n\r\nHe looked, not irritated only, but surprised as well, at finding his\r\nparlor-maid waiting for him in the drawing-room, and inquired, sharply\r\nand suspiciously, what she wanted there? Magdalen replied that she had\r\ncome there to answer the bell. His face cleared a little when he heard\r\nthe explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI did ring, and then\r\nI forgot it.\xe2\x80\x9d He pulled the sliding door back into its place as he\r\nspoke. \xe2\x80\x9cCoals,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, impatiently, pointing to the empty scuttle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rang for coals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen went back to the kitchen regions. After communicating the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s order to the servant whose special duty it was to attend to\r\nthe fires, she returned to the pantry, and, gently closing the door,\r\nsat down alone to think.\r\n\r\nIt had been her impression in the drawing-room\xe2\x80\x94and it was her\r\nimpression still\xe2\x80\x94that she had accidentally surprised Admiral Bartram on\r\na visit to the east rooms, which, for some urgent reason of his own, he\r\nwished to keep a secret. Haunted day and night by the one dominant idea\r\nthat now possessed her, she leaped all logical difficulties at a bound,\r\nand at once associated the suspicion of a secret proceeding on the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s part with the kindred suspicion which pointed to him as the\r\ndepositary of the Secret Trust. Up to this time it had been her settled\r\nbelief that he kept all his important documents in one or other of the\r\nsuite of rooms which he happened to be occupying for the time being.\r\nWhy\xe2\x80\x94she now asked herself, with a sudden distrust of the conclusion\r\nwhich had hitherto satisfied her mind\xe2\x80\x94why might he not lock some of\r\nthem up in the other rooms as well? The remembrance of the keys still\r\nconcealed in their hiding-place in her room sharpened her sense of the\r\nreasonableness of this new view. With one unimportant exception, those\r\nkeys had all failed when she tried them in the rooms on the north side\r\nof the house. Might they not succeed with the cabinets and cupboards in\r\nthe east rooms, on which she had never tried them, or thought of trying\r\nthem, yet? If there was a chance, however small, of turning them to\r\nbetter account than she had turned them thus far, it was a chance to be\r\ntried. If there was a possibility, however remote, that the Trust might\r\nbe hidden in any one of the locked repositories in the east wing, it\r\nwas a possibility to be put to the test. When? Her own experience\r\nanswered the question. At the time when no prying eyes were open, and\r\nno accidents were to be feared\xe2\x80\x94when the house was quiet\xe2\x80\x94in the dead of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nShe knew enough of her changed self to dread the enervating influence\r\nof delay. She determined to run the risk headlong that night.\r\n\r\nMore blunders escaped her when dinner-time came; the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncriticisms on her waiting at table were sharper than ever. His hardest\r\nwords inflicted no pain on her; she scarcely heard him\xe2\x80\x94her mind was\r\ndull to every sense but the sense of the coming trial. The evening\r\nwhich had passed slowly to her on the night of her first experiment\r\nwith the keys passed quickly now. When bed-time came, bed-time took her\r\nby surprise.\r\n\r\nShe waited longer on this occasion than she had waited before. The\r\nadmiral was at home; he might alter his mind and go downstairs again,\r\nafter he had gone up to his room; he might have forgotten something in\r\nthe library and might return to fetch it. Midnight struck from the\r\nclock in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall before she ventured out of her room, with\r\nthe keys again in her pocket, with the candle again in her hand.\r\n\r\nAt the first of the stairs on which she set her foot to descend, an\r\nall-mastering hesitation, an unintelligible shrinking from some peril\r\nunknown, seized her on a sudden. She waited, and reasoned with herself.\r\nShe had recoiled from no sacrifices, she had yielded to no fears, in\r\ncarrying out the stratagem by which she had gained admission to St.\r\nCrux; and now, when the long array of difficulties at the outset had\r\nbeen patiently conquered, now, when by sheer force of resolution the\r\nstarting-point was gained, she hesitated to advance. \xe2\x80\x9cI shrank from\r\nnothing to get here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat madness possesses me\r\nthat I shrink now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery pulse in her quickened at the thought, with an animating shame\r\nthat nerved her to go on. She descended the stairs, from the third\r\nfloor to the second, from the second to the first, without trusting\r\nherself to pause again within easy reach of her own room. In another\r\nminute, she had reached the end of the corridor, had crossed the\r\nvestibule, and had entered the drawing-room. It was only when her grasp\r\nwas on the heavy brass handle of the sliding door\xe2\x80\x94it was only at the\r\nmoment before she pushed the door back\xe2\x80\x94that she waited to take breath.\r\nThe Banqueting-Hall was close on the other side of the wooden partition\r\nagainst which she stood; her excited imagination felt the death-like\r\nchill of it flowing over her already.\r\n\r\nShe pushed back the sliding door a few inches\xe2\x80\x94and stopped in momentary\r\nalarm. When the admiral had closed it in her presence that day, she had\r\nheard no noise. When old Mazey had opened it to show her the rooms in\r\nthe east wing, she had heard no noise. Now, in the night silence, she\r\nnoticed for the first time that the door made a sound\xe2\x80\x94a dull, rushing\r\nsound, like the wind.\r\n\r\nShe roused herself, and pushed it further back\xe2\x80\x94pushed it halfway into\r\nthe hollow chamber in the wall constructed to receive it. She advanced\r\nboldly into the gap, and met the night view of the Banqueting-Hall face\r\nto face.\r\n\r\nThe moon was rounding the southern side of the house. Her paling beams\r\nstreamed through the nearer windows, and lay in long strips of slanting\r\nlight on the marble pavement of the Hall. The black shadows of the\r\npediments between each window, alternating with the strips of light,\r\nheightened the wan glare of the moonshine on the floor. Toward its\r\nlower end, the Hall melted mysteriously into darkness. The ceiling was\r\nlost to view; the yawning fire-place, the overhanging mantel-piece, the\r\nlong row of battle pictures above, were all swallowed up in night. But\r\none visible object was discernible, besides the gleaming windows and\r\nthe moon-striped floor. Midway in the last and furthest of the strips\r\nof light, the tripod rose erect on its gaunt black legs, like a monster\r\ncalled to life by the moon\xe2\x80\x94a monster rising through the light, and\r\nmelting invisibly into the upper shadows of the Hall. Far and near, all\r\nsound lay dead, drowned in the stagnant cold. The soothing hush of\r\nnight was awful here. The deep abysses of darkness hid abysses of\r\nsilence more immeasurable still.\r\n\r\nShe stood motionless in the door-way, with straining eyes, with\r\nstraining ears. She looked for some moving thing, she listened for some\r\nrising sound, and looked and listened in vain. A quick ceaseless\r\nshivering ran through her from head to foot. The shivering of fear, or\r\nthe shivering of cold? The bare doubt roused her resolute will. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe thought, advancing a step through the door-way, \xe2\x80\x9cor never! I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncount the strips of moonlight three times over, and cross the Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two,\r\nthree, four, five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the final number passed her lips at the third time of counting, she\r\ncrossed the Hall. Looking for nothing, listening for nothing, one hand\r\nholding the candle, the other mechanically grasping the folds of her\r\ndress, she sped, ghost-like, down the length of the ghostly place. She\r\nreached the door of the first of the eastern rooms, opened it, and ran\r\nin. The sudden relief of attaining a refuge, the sudden entrance into a\r\nnew atmosphere, overpowered her for the moment. She had just time to\r\nput the candle safely on a table before she dropped giddy and\r\nbreathless into the nearest chair.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she felt the rest quieting her. In a few minutes she\r\nbecame conscious of the triumph of having won her way to the east\r\nrooms. In a few minutes she was strong enough to rise from the chair,\r\nto take the keys from her pocket, and to look round her.\r\n\r\nThe first objects of furniture in the room which attracted her\r\nattention were an old bureau of carved oak, and a heavy buhl table with\r\na cabinet attached. She tried the bureau first; it looked the likeliest\r\nreceptacle for papers of the two. Three of the keys proved to be of a\r\nsize to enter the lock, but none of them would turn it. The bureau was\r\nunassailable. She left it, and paused to trim the wick of the candle\r\nbefore she tried the buhl cabinet next.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when she raised her hand to the candle, she heard the\r\nstillness of the Banqueting-Hall shudder with the terror of a sound\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsound faint and momentary, like the distant rushing of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe sliding door in the drawing-room had moved.\r\n\r\nWhich way had it moved? Had an unknown hand pushed it back in its\r\nsocket further than she had pushed it, or pulled it to again, and\r\nclosed it? The horror of being shut out all night, by some\r\nundiscoverable agency, from the life of the house, was stronger in her\r\nthan the horror of looking across the Banqueting-Hall. She made\r\ndesperately for the door of the room.\r\n\r\nIt had fallen to silently after her when she had come in, but it was\r\nnot closed. She pulled it open, and looked.\r\n\r\nThe sight that met her eyes rooted her, panic-stricken, to the spot.\r\n\r\nClose to the first of the row of windows, counting from the\r\ndrawing-room, and full in the gleam of it, she saw a solitary figure.\r\nIt stood motionless, rising out of the furthest strip of moonlight on\r\nthe floor. As she looked, it suddenly disappeared. In another instant\r\nshe saw it again, in the second strip of moonlight\xe2\x80\x94lost it again\xe2\x80\x94saw it\r\nin the third strip\xe2\x80\x94lost it once more\xe2\x80\x94and saw it in the fourth. Moment\r\nby moment it advanced, now mysteriously lost in the shadow, now\r\nsuddenly visible again in the light, until it reached the fifth and\r\nnearest strip of moonlight. There it paused, and strayed aside slowly\r\nto the middle of the Hall. It stopped at the tripod, and stood,\r\nshivering audibly in the silence, with its hands raised over the dead\r\nashes, in the action of warming them at a fire. It turned back again,\r\nmoving down the path of the moonlight, stopped at the fifth window,\r\nturned once more, and came on softly through the shadow straight to the\r\nplace where Magdalen stood.\r\n\r\nHer voice was dumb, her will was helpless. Every sense in her but the\r\nseeing sense was paralyzed. The seeing sense\xe2\x80\x94held fast in the fetters\r\nof its own terror\xe2\x80\x94looked unchangeably straightforward, as it had looked\r\nfrom the first. There she stood in the door-way, full in the path of\r\nthe figure advancing on her through the shadow, nearer and nearer, step\r\nby step.\r\n\r\nIt came close.\r\n\r\nThe bonds of horror that held her burst asunder when it was within\r\narm\xe2\x80\x99s-length. She started back. The light of the candle on the table\r\nfell full on its face, and showed her\xe2\x80\x94Admiral Bartram.\r\n\r\nA long, gray dressing-gown was wrapped round him. His head was\r\nuncovered; his feet were bare. In his left hand he carried his little\r\nbasket of keys. He passed Magdalen slowly, his lips whispering without\r\nintermission, his open eyes staring straight before him with the glassy\r\nstare of death. His eyes revealed to her the terrifying truth. He was\r\nwalking in his sleep.\r\n\r\nThe terror of seeing him as she saw him now was not the terror she had\r\nfelt when her eyes first lighted on him\xe2\x80\x94an apparition in the\r\nmoon-light, a specter in the ghostly Hall. This time she could struggle\r\nagainst the shock; she could feel the depth of her own fear.\r\n\r\nHe passed her, and stopped in the middle of the room. Magdalen ventured\r\nnear enough to him to be within reach of his voice as he muttered to\r\nhimself. She ventured nearer still, and heard the name of her dead\r\nhusband fall distinctly from the sleep-walker\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoel!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the low monotonous tones of a dreamer talking in\r\nhis sleep, \xe2\x80\x9cmy good fellow, Noel, take it back again! It worries me day\r\nand night. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where it\xe2\x80\x99s safe; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to put it.\r\nTake it back, Noel\xe2\x80\x94take it back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs those words escaped him, he walked to the buhl cabinet. He sat down\r\nin the chair placed before it, and searched in the basket among his\r\nkeys. Magdalen softly followed him, and stood behind his chair, waiting\r\nwith the candle in her hand. He found the key, and unlocked the\r\ncabinet. Without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, he drew out a drawer, the\r\nsecond of a row. The one thing in the drawer was a folded letter. He\r\nremoved it, and put it down before him on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it back,\r\nNoel!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, mechanically; \xe2\x80\x9ctake it back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen looked over his shoulder and read these lines, traced in her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, at the top of the letter: _To be kept in your\r\nown possession, and to be opened by yourself only on the day of my\r\ndecease. Noel Vanstone._ She saw the words plainly, with the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname and the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s address written under them.\r\n\r\nThe Trust within reach of her hand! The Trust traced to its\r\nhiding-place at last!\r\n\r\nShe took one step forward, to steal round his chair and to snatch the\r\nletter from the table. At the instant when she moved, he took it up\r\nonce more, locked the cabinet, and, rising, turned and faced her.\r\n\r\nIn the impulse of the moment, she stretched out her hand toward the\r\nhand in which he held the letter. The yellow candle-light fell full on\r\nhim. The awful death-in-life of his face\xe2\x80\x94the mystery of the sleeping\r\nbody, moving in unconscious obedience to the dreaming mind\xe2\x80\x94daunted her.\r\nHer hand trembled, and dropped again at her side.\r\n\r\nHe put the key of the cabinet back in the basket, and crossed the room\r\nto the bureau, with the basket in one hand and the letter in the other.\r\nMagdalen set the candle on the table again, and watched him. As he had\r\nopened the cabinet, so he now opened the bureau. Once more Magdalen\r\nstretched out her hand, and once more she recoiled before the mystery\r\nand the terror of his sleep. He put the letter in a drawer at the back\r\nof the bureau, and closed the heavy oaken lid again. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafer there, as you say, Noel\xe2\x80\x94safer there.\xe2\x80\x9d So he spoke. So, time\r\nafter time, the words that betrayed him revealed the dead man living\r\nand speaking again in the dream.\r\n\r\nHad he locked the bureau? Magdalen had not heard the lock turn. As he\r\nslowly moved away, walking back once more toward the middle of the\r\nroom, she tried the lid. It was locked. That discovery made, she looked\r\nto see what he was doing next. He was leaving the room again, with the\r\nbasket of keys in his hand. When her first glance overtook him, he was\r\ncrossing the threshold of the door.\r\n\r\nSome inscrutable fascination possessed her, some mysterious attraction\r\ndrew her after him, in spite of herself. She took up the candle and\r\nfollowed him mechanically, as if she too were walking in her sleep. One\r\nbehind the other, in slow and noiseless progress, they crossed the\r\nBanqueting-Hall. One behind the other, they passed through the\r\ndrawing-room, and along the corridor, and up the stairs. She followed\r\nhim to his own door. He went in, and shut it behind him softly. She\r\nstopped, and looked toward the truckle-bed. It was pushed aside at the\r\nfoot, some little distance away from the bedroom door. Who had moved\r\nit? She held the candle close and looked toward the pillow, with a\r\nsudden curiosity and a sudden doubt.\r\n\r\nThe truckle-bed was empty.\r\n\r\nThe discovery startled her for the moment, and for the moment only.\r\nPlain as the inferences were to be drawn from it, she never drew them.\r\nHer mind, slowly recovering the exercise of its faculties, was still\r\nunder the influence of the earlier and the deeper impressions produced\r\non it. Her mind followed the admiral into his room, as her body had\r\nfollowed him across the Banqueting-Hall.\r\n\r\nHad he lain down again in his bed? Was he still asleep? She listened at\r\nthe door. Not a sound was audible in the room. She tried the door, and,\r\nfinding it not locked, softly opened it a few inches and listened\r\nagain. The rise and fall of his low, regular breathing instantly caught\r\nher ear. He was still asleep.\r\n\r\nShe went into the room, and, shading the candle-light with her hand,\r\napproached the bedside to look at him. The dream was past; the old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s sleep was deep and peaceful; his lips were still; his quiet hand\r\nwas laid over the coverlet in motionless repose. He lay with his face\r\nturned toward the right-hand side of the bed. A little table stood\r\nthere within reach of his hand. Four objects were placed on it; his\r\ncandle, his matches, his customary night drink of lemonade, and his\r\nbasket of keys.\r\n\r\nThe idea of possessing herself of his keys that night (if an\r\nopportunity offered when the basket was not in his hand) had first\r\ncrossed her mind when she saw him go into his room. She had lost it\r\nagain for the moment, in the surprise of discovering the empty\r\ntruckle-bed. She now recovered it the instant the table attracted her\r\nattention. It was useless to waste time in trying to choose the one key\r\nwanted from the rest\xe2\x80\x94the one key was not well enough known to her to be\r\nreadily identified. She took all the keys from the table, in the basket\r\nas they lay, and noiselessly closed the door behind her on leaving the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe truckle-bed, as she passed it, obtruded itself again on her\r\nattention, and forced her to think of it. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsideration, she moved the foot of the bed back to its customary\r\nposition across the door. Whether he was in the house or out of it, the\r\nveteran might return to his deserted post at any moment. If he saw the\r\nbed moved from its usual place, he might suspect something wrong, he\r\nmight rouse his master, and the loss of the keys might be discovered.\r\n\r\nNothing happened as she descended the stairs, nothing happened as she\r\npassed along the corridor; the house was as silent and as solitary as\r\never. She crossed the Banqueting-Hall this time without hesitation; the\r\nevents of the night had hardened her mind against all imaginary\r\nterrors. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I have got it!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to herself, in an\r\nirrepressible outburst of exaltation, as she entered the first of the\r\neast rooms and put her candle on the top of the old bureau.\r\n\r\nEven yet there was a trial in store for her patience. Some minutes\r\nelapsed\xe2\x80\x94minutes that seemed hours\xe2\x80\x94before she found the right key and\r\nraised the lid of the bureau. At last she drew out the inner drawer! At\r\nlast she had the letter in her hand!\r\n\r\nIt had been sealed, but the seal was broken. She opened it on the spot,\r\nto make sure that she had actually possessed herself of the Trust\r\nbefore leaving the room. The end of the letter was the first part of it\r\nshe turned to. It came to its conclusion high on the third page, and it\r\nwas signed by Noel Vanstone. Below the name these lines were added in\r\nthe admiral\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis letter was received by me at the same time with the will of my\r\nfriend, Noel Vanstone. In the event of my death, without leaving any\r\nother directions respecting it, I beg my nephew and my executors to\r\nunderstand that I consider the requests made in this document as\r\nabsolutely binding on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cARTHUR EVERARD BARTRAM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left those lines unread. She just noticed that they were not in\r\nNoel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting; and, passing over them instantly, as\r\nimmaterial to the object in view, turned the leaves of the letter, and\r\ntransferred her attention to the opening sentences on the first page.\r\nShe read these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR ADMIRAL BARTRAM\xe2\x80\x94When you open my Will (in which you are named my\r\nsole executor), you will find that I have bequeathed the whole residue\r\nof my estate\xe2\x80\x94after payment of one legacy of five thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nyourself. It is the purpose of my letter to tell you privately what the\r\nobject is for which I have left you the fortune which is now placed in\r\nyour hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to consider this large legacy as intended\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had proceeded thus far with breathless curiosity and interest, when\r\nher attention suddenly failed her. Something\xe2\x80\x94she was too deeply\r\nabsorbed to know what\xe2\x80\x94had got between her and the letter. Was it a\r\nsound in the Banqueting-Hall again? She looked over her shoulder at the\r\ndoor behind her, and listened. Nothing was to be heard, nothing was to\r\nbe seen. She returned to the letter.\r\n\r\nThe writing was cramped and close. In her impatient curiosity to read\r\nmore, she failed to find the lost place again. Her eyes, attracted by a\r\nblot, lighted on a sentence lower in the page than the sentence at\r\nwhich she had left off. The first three words she saw riveted her\r\nattention anew\xe2\x80\x94they were the first words she had met with in the letter\r\nwhich directly referred to George Bartram. In the sudden excitement of\r\nthat discovery, she read the rest of the sentence eagerly, before she\r\nmade any second attempt to return to the lost place:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your nephew fails to comply with these conditions\xe2\x80\x94that is to say,\r\nif, being either a bachelor or a widower at the time of my decease, he\r\nfails to marry in all respects as I have here instructed him to marry,\r\nwithin six calendar months from that time\xe2\x80\x94it is my desire that he shall\r\nnot receive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had read to that point, to that last word and no further, when a\r\nhand passed suddenly from behind her between the letter and her eye,\r\nand gripped her fast by the wrist in an instant.\r\n\r\nShe turned with a shriek of terror, and found herself face to face with\r\nold Mazey.\r\n\r\nThe veteran\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were bloodshot; his hand was heavy; his list\r\nslippers were twisted crookedly on his feet; and his body swayed to and\r\nfro on his widely parted legs. If he had tested his condition that\r\nnight by the unfailing criterion of the model ship, he must have\r\ninevitably pronounced sentence on himself in the usual form: \xe2\x80\x9cDrunk\r\nagain, Mazey; drunk again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou young Jezebel!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old sailor, with a leer on one side of\r\nhis face, and a frown on the other. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next time you take to\r\nnight-walking in the neighborhood of Freeze-your-Bones, use those sharp\r\neyes of yours first, and make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody else night walking in\r\nthe garden outside. Drop it, Jezebel! drop it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKeeping fast hold of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s arm with one hand, he took the letter\r\nfrom her with the other, put it back into the open drawer, and locked\r\nthe bureau. She never struggled with him, she never spoke. Her energy\r\nwas gone; her powers of resistance were crushed. The terrors of that\r\nhorrible night, following one close on the other in reiterated shocks,\r\nhad struck her down at last. She yielded as submissively, she trembled\r\nas helplessly, as the weakest woman living.\r\n\r\nOld Mazey dropped her arm, and pointed with drunken solemnity to a\r\nchair in an inner corner of the room. She sat down, still without\r\nuttering a word. The veteran (breathing very hard over it) steadied\r\nhimself on both elbows against the slanting top of the bureau, and from\r\nthat commanding position addressed Magdalen once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and be locked up!\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey, wagging his venerable head\r\nwith judicial severity. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be a court of inquiry to-morrow\r\nmorning, and I\xe2\x80\x99m witness\xe2\x80\x94worse luck!\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m witness. You young jade,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve committed burglary\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done. His honor the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s keys stolen; his honor the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s desk ransacked; and his\r\nhonor the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s private letters broke open. Burglary! Burglary!\r\nCome and be locked up!\xe2\x80\x9d He slowly recovered an upright position, with\r\nthe assistance of his hands, backed by the solid resisting power of the\r\nbureau; and lapsed into lachrymose soliloquy. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99d have thought it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid old Mazey, paternally watering at the eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cTake the outside of\r\nher, and she\xe2\x80\x99s as straight as a poplar; take the inside of her, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s as crooked as Sin. Such a fine-grown girl, too. What a pity! what\r\na pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, faintly, as old Mazey staggered up to\r\nthe chair, and took her by the wrist again. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m frightened, Mr.\r\nMazey\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m dreadfully frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the veteran. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a deal too fond of you\xe2\x80\x94and more\r\nshame for me at my age!\xe2\x80\x94to hurt you. If I let go of your wrist, will\r\nyou walk straight before me, where I can see you all the way? Will you\r\nbe a good girl, and walk straight up to your own door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen gave the promise required of her\xe2\x80\x94gave it with an eager longing\r\nto reach the refuge of her room. She rose, and tried to take the candle\r\nfrom the bureau, but old Mazey\xe2\x80\x99s cunning hand was too quick for her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the candle be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the veteran, winking in momentary\r\nforgetfulness of his responsible position. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a trifle quicker on\r\nyour legs than I am, my dear, and you might leave me in the lurch, if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t carry the light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey returned to the inhabited side of the house. Staggering after\r\nMagdalen, with the basket of keys in one hand and the candle in the\r\nother, old Mazey sorrowfully compared her figure with the straightness\r\nof the poplar, and her disposition with the crookedness of Sin, all the\r\nway across \xe2\x80\x9cFreeze-your-Bones,\xe2\x80\x9d and all the way upstairs to her own\r\ndoor. Arrived at that destination, he peremptorily refused to give her\r\nthe candle until he had first seen her safely inside the room. The\r\nconditions being complied with, he resigned the light with one hand,\r\nand made a dash with the other at the key, drew it from the inside of\r\nthe lock, and instantly closed the door. Magdalen heard him outside\r\nchuckling over his own dexterity, and fitting the key into the lock\r\nagain with infinite difficulty. At last he secured the door, with a\r\ndeep grunt of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cThere she is safe!\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalen heard him say, in\r\nregretful soliloquy. \xe2\x80\x9cAs fine a girl as ever I sat eyes on. What a\r\npity! what a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last sounds of his voice died out in the distance; and she was left\r\nalone in her room.\r\n\r\nHolding fast by the banister, old Mazey made his way down to the\r\ncorridor on the second floor, in which a night light was always\r\nburning. He advanced to the truckle-bed, and, steadying himself against\r\nthe opposite wall, looked at it attentively. Prolonged contemplation of\r\nhis own resting-place for the night apparently failed to satisfy him.\r\nHe shook his head ominously, and, taking from the side-pocket of his\r\ngreat-coat a pair of old patched slippers, surveyed them with an aspect\r\nof illimitable doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all abroad to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroubled in my mind\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is\xe2\x80\x94troubled in my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old patched slippers and the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s existing perplexities\r\nhappened to be intimately associated one with the other, in the\r\nrelation of cause and effect. The slippers belonged to the admiral, who\r\nhad taken one of his unreasonable fancies to this particular pair, and\r\nwho still persisted in wearing them long after they were unfit for his\r\nservice. Early that afternoon old Mazey had taken the slippers to the\r\nvillage cobbler to get them repaired on the spot, before his master\r\ncalled for them the next morning; he sat superintending the progress\r\nand completion of the work until evening came, when he and the cobbler\r\nbetook themselves to the village inn to drink each other\xe2\x80\x99s healths at\r\nparting. They had prolonged this social ceremony till far into the\r\nnight, and they had parted, as a necessary consequence, in a finished\r\nand perfect state of intoxication on either side.\r\n\r\nIf the drinking-bout had led to no other result than those night\r\nwanderings in the grounds of St. Crux, which had shown old Mazey the\r\nlight in the east windows, his memory would unquestionably have\r\npresented it to him the next morning in the aspect of one of the\r\npraiseworthy achievements of his life. But another consequence had\r\nsprung from it, which the old sailor now saw dimly, through the\r\ninterposing bewilderment left in his brain by the drink. He had\r\ncommitted a breach of discipline, and a breach of trust. In plainer\r\nwords, he had deserted his post.\r\n\r\nThe one safeguard against Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional tendency to\r\nsomnambulism was the watch and ward which his faithful old servant kept\r\noutside his door. No entreaties had ever prevailed on him to submit to\r\nthe usual precaution taken in such cases. He peremptorily declined to\r\nbe locked into his room; he even ignored his own liability, whenever a\r\ndream disturbed him, to walk in his sleep. Over and over again, old\r\nMazey had been roused by the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to push past the\r\ntruckle-bed, or to step over it, in his sleep; and over and over again,\r\nwhen the veteran had reported the fact the next morning, his master had\r\ndeclined to believe him. As the old sailor now stood, staring in vacant\r\ninquiry at the bed-chamber door, these incidents of the past rose\r\nconfusedly on his memory, and forced on him the serious question\r\nwhether the admiral had left his room during the earlier hours of the\r\nnight. If by any mischance the sleep-walking fit had seized him, the\r\nslippers in old Mazey\xe2\x80\x99s hand pointed straight to the conclusion that\r\nfollowed\xe2\x80\x94his master must have passed barefoot in the cold night over\r\nthe stone stairs and passages of St. Crux. \xe2\x80\x9cLord send he\xe2\x80\x99s been quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmuttered old Mazey, daunted, bold as he was and drunk as he was, by the\r\nbare contemplation of that prospect. \xe2\x80\x9cIf his honor\xe2\x80\x99s been walking\r\nto-night, it will be the death of him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe roused himself for the moment by main force\xe2\x80\x94strong in his dog-like\r\nfidelity to the admiral, though strong in nothing else\xe2\x80\x94and fought off\r\nthe stupor of the drink. He looked at the bed with steadier eyes and a\r\nclearer mind. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s precaution in returning it to its customary\r\nposition presented it to him necessarily in the aspect of a bed which\r\nhad never been moved from its place. He next examined the counterpane\r\ncarefully. Not the faintest vestige appeared of the indentation which\r\nmust have been left by footsteps passing over it. There was the plain\r\nevidence before him\xe2\x80\x94the evidence recognizable at last by his own\r\nbewildered eyes\xe2\x80\x94that the admiral had never moved from his room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the Pledge to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled old Mazey, in an outburst of\r\ngrateful relief. The next moment the fumes of the liquor floated back\r\ninsidiously over his brain; and the veteran, returning to his customary\r\nremedy, paced the passage in zigzag as usual, and kept watch on the\r\ndeck of an imaginary ship.\r\n\r\nSoon after sunrise, Magdalen suddenly heard the grating of the key from\r\noutside in the lock of the door. The door opened, and old Mazey\r\nre-appeared on the threshold. The first fever of his intoxication had\r\ncooled, with time, into a mild, penitential glow. He breathed harder\r\nthan ever, in a succession of low growls, and wagged his venerable head\r\nat his own delinquencies without intermission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you now, you young land-shark in petticoats?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the old\r\nsailor. \xe2\x80\x9cHas your conscience been quiet enough to let you go to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not slept,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen, drawing back from him in doubt of\r\nwhat he might do next. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no remembrance of what happened after\r\nyou locked the door\xe2\x80\x94I think I must have fainted. Don\xe2\x80\x99t frighten me\r\nagain, Mr. Mazey! I feel miserably weak and ill. What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to say something serious,\xe2\x80\x9d replied old Mazey, with impenetrable\r\nsolemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been on my mind to come here and make a clean breast\r\nof it, for the last hour or more. Mark my words, young woman. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto disgrace myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen drew further and further back, and looked at him in rising\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know my duty to his honor the admiral,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded old Mazey, waving\r\nhis hand drearily in the direction of his master\xe2\x80\x99s door. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, try as\r\nhard as I may, I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it in my heart, you young jade, to be\r\nwitness against you. I liked the make of you (especially about the\r\nwaist) when you first came into the house, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help liking the\r\nmake of you still\xe2\x80\x94though you _have_ committed burglary, and though you\r\n_are_ as crooked as Sin. I\xe2\x80\x99ve cast the eyes of indulgence on fine-grown\r\ngirls all my life, and it\xe2\x80\x99s too late in the day to cast the eyes of\r\nseverity on \xe2\x80\x99em now. I\xe2\x80\x99m seventy-seven, or seventy-eight, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrightly know which. I\xe2\x80\x99m a battered old hulk, with my seams opening, and\r\nmy pumps choked, and the waters of Death powering in on me as fast as\r\nthey can. I\xe2\x80\x99m as miserable a sinner as you\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with anywhere in\r\nthese parts\xe2\x80\x94Thomas Nagle, the cobbler, only excepted; and he\xe2\x80\x99s worse\r\nthan I am, for he\xe2\x80\x99s the younger of the two, and he ought to know\r\nbetter. But the long and short or it is, I shall go down to my grave\r\nwith an eye of indulgence for a fine-grown girl. More shame for me, you\r\nyoung Jezebel\xe2\x80\x94more shame for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe veteran\xe2\x80\x99s unmanageable eyes began to leer again in spite of him, as\r\nhe concluded his harangue in these terms: the last reserves of\r\nausterity left in his face entrenched themselves dismally round the\r\ncorners of his mouth. Magdalen approached him again, and tried to\r\nspeak. He solemnly motioned her back with another dreary wave of his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo carneying!\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bad enough already, without that.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s my duty to make my report to his honor the admiral, and I _will_\r\nmake it. But if you like to give the house the slip before the\r\nburglary\xe2\x80\x99s reported, and the court of inquiry begins, I\xe2\x80\x99ll disgrace\r\nmyself by letting you go. It\xe2\x80\x99s market morning at Ossory, and Dawkes\r\nwill be driving the light cart over in a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\nDawkes will take you if I ask him. I know my duty\xe2\x80\x94my duty is to turn\r\nthe key on you, and see Dawkes damned first. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it in my\r\nheart to be hard on a fine girl like you. It\xe2\x80\x99s bred in the bone, and it\r\nwunt come out of the flesh. More shame for me, I tell you again\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nshame for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proposal thus strangely and suddenly presented to her took Magdalen\r\ncompletely by surprise. She had been far too seriously shaken by the\r\nevents of the night to be capable of deciding on any subject at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good to me, Mr. Mazey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I\r\nhave a minute by myself to think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you may,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the veteran, facing about forthwith and leaving\r\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all alike,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded old Mazey, with his head still\r\nrunning on the sex. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you offer \xe2\x80\x99em, they always want something\r\nmore. Tall and short, native and foreign, sweethearts and wives,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re all alike!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft by herself, Magdalen reached her decision with far less difficulty\r\nthan she had anticipated.\r\n\r\nIf she remained in the house, there were only two courses before her\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ncharge old Mazey with speaking under the influence of a drunken\r\ndelusion, or to submit to circumstances. Though she owed to the old\r\nsailor her defeat in the very hour of success, his consideration for\r\nher at that moment forbade the idea of defending herself at his\r\nexpense\xe2\x80\x94even supposing, what was in the last degree improbable, that\r\nthe defense would be credited. In the second of the two cases (the case\r\nof submission to circumstances), but one result could be\r\nexpected\xe2\x80\x94instant dismissal, and perhaps discovery as well. What object\r\nwas to be gained by braving that degradation\xe2\x80\x94by leaving the house\r\npublicly disgraced in the eyes of the servants who had hated and\r\ndistrusted her from the first? The accident which had literally\r\nsnatched the Trust from her possession when she had it in her hand was\r\nirreparable. The one apparent compensation under the disaster\xe2\x80\x94in other\r\nwords, the discovery that the Trust actually existed, and that George\r\nBartram\xe2\x80\x99s marriage within a given time was one of the objects contained\r\nin it\xe2\x80\x94was a compensation which could only be estimated at its true\r\nvalue by placing it under the light of Mr. Loscombe\xe2\x80\x99s experience. Every\r\nmotive of which she was conscious was a motive which urged her to leave\r\nthe house secretly while the chance was at her disposal. She looked out\r\ninto the passage, and called softly to old Mazey to come back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept your offer thankfully, Mr. Mazey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat hard measure you dealt out to me when you took that letter from my\r\nhand. But you did your duty, and I can be grateful to you for sparing\r\nme this morning, hard as you were upon me last night. I am not such a\r\nbad girl as you think me\xe2\x80\x94I am not, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Mazey dismissed the subject with another dreary wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the veteran; \xe2\x80\x9clet it be! It makes no difference, my\r\ngirl, to such an old rascal as I am. If you were fifty times worse than\r\nyou are, I should let you go all the same. Put on your bonnet and\r\nshawl, and come along. I\xe2\x80\x99m a disgrace to myself and a warning to\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am. No luggage, mind! Leave all your rattle-traps\r\nbehind you: to be overhauled, if necessary, at his honor the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscretion. I can be hard enough on your boxes, you young Jezebel, if I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be hard on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, old Mazey led the way out of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThe less I\r\nsee of her the better\xe2\x80\x94especially about the waist,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself,\r\nas he hobbled downstairs with the help of the banisters.\r\n\r\nThe cart was standing in the back yard when they reached the lower\r\nregions of the house, and Dawkes (otherwise the farm-bailiff\xe2\x80\x99s man) was\r\nfastening the last buckle of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s harness. The hoar-frost of the\r\nmorning was still white in the shade. The sparkling points of it\r\nglistened brightly on the shaggy coats of Brutus and Cassius, as they\r\nidled about the yard, waiting, with steaming mouths and slowly wagging\r\ntails, to see the cart drive off. Old Mazey went out alone and used his\r\ninfluence with Dawkes, who, staring in stolid amazement, put a leather\r\ncushion on the cart-seat for his fellow-traveler. Shivering in the\r\nsharp morning air, Magdalen waited, while the preliminaries of\r\ndeparture were in progress, conscious of nothing but a giddy\r\nbewilderment of thought, and a helpless suspension of feeling. The\r\nevents of the night confused themselves hideously with the trivial\r\ncircumstances passing before her eyes in the courtyard. She started\r\nwith the sudden terror of the night when old Mazey re-appeared to\r\nsummon her out to the cart. She trembled with the helpless confusion of\r\nthe night when the veteran cast the eyes of indulgence on her for the\r\nlast time, and gave her a kiss on the cheek at parting. The next minute\r\nshe felt him help her into the cart, and pat her on the back. The next,\r\nshe heard him tell her in a confidential whisper that, sitting or\r\nstanding, she was as straight as a poplar either way. Then there was a\r\npause, in which nothing was said, and nothing done; and then the driver\r\ntook the reins in hand and mounted to his place.\r\n\r\nShe roused herself at the parting moment and looked back. The last\r\nsight she saw at St. Crux was old Mazey wagging his head in the\r\ncourtyard, with his fellow-profligates, the dogs, keeping time to him\r\nwith their tails. The last words she heard were the words in which the\r\nveteran paid his farewell tribute to her charms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurglary or no burglary,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mazey, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a fine-grown girl, if\r\never there was a fine one yet. What a pity! what a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE SEVENTH SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\r\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\r\n\r\nI.\r\nFrom George Bartram to Admiral Bartram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLondon, April 3d, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear uncle,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hasty line, to inform you of a temporary obstacle, which we\r\nneither of us anticipated when we took leave of each other at St. Crux.\r\nWhile I was wasting the last days of the week at the Grange, the\r\nTyrrels must have been making their arrangements for leaving London. I\r\nhave just come from Portland Place. The house is shut up, and the\r\nfamily (Miss Vanstone, of course, included) left England yesterday, to\r\npass the season in Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t let yourself be annoyed by this little check at starting.\r\nIt is of no serious importance whatever. I have got the address at\r\nwhich the Tyrrels are living, and I mean to cross the Channel after\r\nthem by the mail to-night. I shall find my opportunity in Paris just as\r\nsoon as I could have found it in London. The grass shall not grow under\r\nmy feet, I promise you. For once in my life, I will take Time as\r\nfiercely by the forelock as if I was the most impetuous man in England;\r\nand, rely on it, the moment I know the result, you shall know the\r\nresult, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffectionately yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEORGE BARTRAM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nFrom George Bartram to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParis, April 13th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just written, with a heavy heart, to my uncle, and I think I\r\nowe it to your kind interest in me not to omit writing next to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will feel for my disappointment, I am sure, when I tell you, in\r\nthe fewest and plainest words, that Miss Vanstone has refused me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy vanity may have grievously misled me, but I confess I expected a\r\nvery different result. My vanity may be misleading me still; for I must\r\nacknowledge to you privately that I think Miss Vanstone was sorry to\r\nrefuse me. The reason she gave for her decision\xe2\x80\x94no doubt a sufficient\r\nreason in her estimation\xe2\x80\x94did not at the time, and does not now, seem\r\nsufficient to _me_. She spoke in the sweetest and kindest manner, but\r\nshe firmly declared that \xe2\x80\x98her family misfortunes\xe2\x80\x99 left her no honorable\r\nalternative\xe2\x80\x94but to think of my own interests as I had not thought of\r\nthem myself\xe2\x80\x94and gratefully to decline accepting my offer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was so painfully agitated that I could not venture to plead my own\r\ncause as I might otherwise have pleaded it. At the first attempt I made\r\nto touch the personal question, she entreated me to spare her, and\r\nabruptly left the room. I am still ignorant whether I am to interpret\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98family misfortunes\xe2\x80\x99 which have set up this barrier between us, as\r\nmeaning the misfortune for which her parents alone are to blame, or the\r\nmisfortune of her having such a woman as Mrs. Noel Vanstone for her\r\nsister. In whichever of these circumstances the obstacle lies, it is no\r\nobstacle in my estimation. Can nothing remove it? Is there no hope?\r\nForgive me for asking these questions. I cannot bear up against my\r\nbitter disappointment. Neither she, nor you, nor any one but myself,\r\ncan know how I love her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver most truly yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEORGE BARTRAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. S.\xe2\x80\x94I shall leave for England in a day or two, passing through\r\nLondon on my way to St. Crux. There are family reasons, connected with\r\nthe hateful subject of money, which make me look forward with anything\r\nbut pleasure to my next interview with my uncle. If you address your\r\nletter to Long\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, it will be sure to reach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nFrom Miss Garth to George Bartram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWestmoreland House, April 16th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. BARTRAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou only did me justice in supposing that your letter would distress\r\nme. If you had supposed that it would make me excessively angry as\r\nwell, you would not have been far wrong. I have no patience with the\r\npride and perversity of the young women of the present day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard from Norah. It is a long letter, stating the particulars\r\nin full detail. I am now going to put all the confidence in your honor\r\nand your discretion which I really feel. For your sake, and for\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s, I am going to let you know what the scruple really is which\r\nhas misled her into the pride and folly of refusing you. I am old\r\nenough to speak out; and I can tell you, if she had only been wise\r\nenough to let her own wishes guide her, she would have said Yes\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ngladly, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe original cause of all the mischief is no less a person than your\r\nworthy uncle\xe2\x80\x94Admiral Bartram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that the admiral took it into his head (I suppose during your\r\nabsence) to go to London by himself and to satisfy some curiosity of\r\nhis own about Norah by calling in Portland Place, under pretense of\r\nrenewing his old friendship with the Tyrrels. He came at luncheon-time,\r\nand saw Norah; and, from all I can hear, was apparently better pleased\r\nwith her than he expected or wished to be when he came into the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far, this is mere guess-work; but it is unluckily certain that he\r\nand Mrs. Tyrrel had some talk together alone when luncheon was over.\r\nYour name was not mentioned; but when their conversation fell on Norah,\r\nyou were in both their minds, of course. The admiral (doing her full\r\njustice personally) declared himself smitten with pity for her hard lot\r\nin life. The scandalous conduct of her sister must always stand (he\r\nfeared) in the way of her future advantage. Who could marry her,\r\nwithout first making it a condition that she and her sister were to be\r\nabsolute strangers to each other? And even then, the objection would\r\nremain\xe2\x80\x94the serious objection to the husband\xe2\x80\x99s family\xe2\x80\x94of being connected\r\nby marriage with such a woman as Mrs. Noel Vanstone. It was very sad;\r\nit was not the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s fault, but it was none the less true that\r\nher sister was her rock ahead in life. So he ran on, with no real\r\nill-feeling toward Norah, but with an obstinate belief in his own\r\nprejudices which bore the aspect of ill-feeling, and which people with\r\nmore temper than judgment would be but too readily disposed to resent\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, Mrs. Tyrrel is one of those people. She is an\r\nexcellent, warm-hearted woman, with a quick temper and very little\r\njudgment; strongly attached to Norah, and heartily interested in\r\nNorah\xe2\x80\x99s welfare. From all I can learn, she first resented the\r\nexpression of the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, in his presence, as worldly and\r\nselfish in the last degree; and then interpreted it, behind his back,\r\nas a hint to discourage his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s visits, which was a downright\r\ninsult offered to a lady in her own house. This was foolish enough so\r\nfar; but worse folly was to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as your uncle was gone, Mrs. Tyrrel, most unwisely and\r\nimproperly, sent for Norah, and, repeating the conversation that had\r\ntaken place, warned her of the reception she might expect from the man\r\nwho stood toward you in the position of a father, if she accepted an\r\noffer of marriage on your part. When I tell you that Norah\xe2\x80\x99s faithful\r\nattachment to her sister still remains unshaken, and that there lies\r\nhidden under her noble submission to the unhappy circumstances of her\r\nlife a proud susceptibility to slights of all kinds, which is deeply\r\nseated in her nature\xe2\x80\x94you will understand the true motive of the refusal\r\nwhich has so naturally and so justly disappointed you. They are all\r\nthree equally to blame in this matter. Your uncle was wrong to state\r\nhis objections so roundly and inconsiderately as he did. Mrs. Tyrrel\r\nwas wrong to let her temper get the better of her, and to suppose\r\nherself insulted where no insult was intended. And Norah was wrong to\r\nplace a scruple of pride, and a hopeless belief in her sister which no\r\nstrangers can be expected to share, above the higher claims of an\r\nattachment which might have secured the happiness and the prosperity of\r\nher future life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the mischief has been done. The next question is, can the harm be\r\nremedied?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope and believe it can. My advice is this: Don\xe2\x80\x99t take No for an\r\nanswer. Give her time enough to reflect on what she has done, and to\r\nregret it (as I believe she will regret it) in secret; trust to my\r\ninfluence over her to plead your cause for you at every opportunity I\r\ncan find; wait patiently for the right moment, and ask her again. Men,\r\nbeing accustomed to act on reflection themselves, are a great deal too\r\napt to believe that women act on reflection, too. Women do nothing of\r\nthe sort. They act on impulse; and, in nine cases out of ten, they are\r\nheartily sorry for it afterward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meanwhile, you must help your own interests by inducing your\r\nuncle to alter his opinion, or at least to make the concession of\r\nkeeping his opinion to himself. Mrs. Tyrrel has rushed to the\r\nconclusion that the harm he has done he did intentionally\xe2\x80\x94which is as\r\nmuch as to say, in so many words, that he had a prophetic conviction,\r\nwhen he came into the house, of what she would do when he left it. My\r\nexplanation of the matter is a much simpler one. I believe that the\r\nknowledge of your attachment naturally aroused his curiosity to see the\r\nobject of it, and that Mrs. Tyrrel\xe2\x80\x99s injudicious praises of Norah\r\nirritated his objections into openly declaring themselves. Anyway, your\r\ncourse lies equally plain before you. Use your influence over your\r\nuncle to persuade him into setting matters right again; trust my\r\nsettled resolution to see Norah your wife before six months more are\r\nover our heads; and believe me, your friend and well-wisher,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHARRIET GARTH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nFrom Mrs. Drake to George Bartram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Crux, April 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI direct these lines to the hotel you usually stay at in London,\r\nhoping that you may return soon enough from foreign parts to receive my\r\nletter without delay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say that some unpleasant events have taken place at St.\r\nCrux since you left it, and that my honored master, the admiral, is far\r\nfrom enjoying his usual good health. On both these accounts, I venture\r\nto write to you on my own responsibility, for I think your presence is\r\nneeded in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarly in the month a most regrettable circumstance took place. Our new\r\nparlor-maid was discovered by Mr. Mazey, at a late hour of the night\r\n(with her master\xe2\x80\x99s basket of keys in her possession), prying into the\r\nprivate documents kept in the east library. The girl removed herself\r\nfrom the house the next morning before we were any of us astir, and she\r\nhas not been heard of since. This event has annoyed and alarmed my\r\nmaster very seriously; and to make matters worse, on the day when the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s treacherous conduct was discovered, the admiral was seized with\r\nthe first symptoms of a severe inflammatory cold. He was not himself\r\naware, nor was any one else, how he had caught the chill. The doctor\r\nwas sent for, and kept the inflammation down until the day before\r\nyesterday, when it broke out again, under circumstances which I am sure\r\nyou will be sorry to hear, as I am truly sorry to write of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the date I have just mentioned\xe2\x80\x94I mean the fifteenth of the month\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nmaster himself informed me that he had been dreadfully disappointed by\r\na letter received from you, which had come in the morning from foreign\r\nparts, and had brought him bad news. He did not tell me what the news\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94but I have never, in all the years I have passed in the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice, seen him so distressingly upset, and so unlike himself, as he\r\nwas on that day. At night his uneasiness seemed to increase. He was in\r\nsuch a state of irritation that he could not bear the sound of Mr.\r\nMazey\xe2\x80\x99s hard breathing outside his door, and he laid his positive\r\norders on the old man to go into one of the bedrooms for that night.\r\nMr. Mazey, to his own great regret, was of course obliged to obey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur only means of preventing the admiral from leaving his room in his\r\nsleep, if the fit unfortunately took him, being now removed, Mr. Mazey\r\nand I agreed to keep watch by turns through the night, sitting, with\r\nthe door ajar, in one of the empty rooms near our master\xe2\x80\x99s bed-chamber.\r\nWe could think of nothing better to do than this, knowing he would not\r\nallow us to lock him in, and not having the door key in our possession,\r\neven if we could have ventured to secure him in his room without his\r\npermission. I kept watch for the first two hours, and then Mr. Mazey\r\ntook my place. After having been some little time in my own room, it\r\noccurred to me that the old man was hard of hearing, and that if his\r\neyes grew at all heavy in the night, his ears were not to be trusted to\r\nwarn him if anything happened. I slipped on my clothes again, and went\r\nback to Mr. Mazey. He was neither asleep nor awake\xe2\x80\x94he was between the\r\ntwo. My mind misgave me, and I went on to the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s room. The door\r\nwas open, and the bed was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mazey and I went downstairs instantly. We looked in all the north\r\nrooms, one after another, and found no traces of him. I thought of the\r\ndrawing-room next, and, being the more active of the two, went first to\r\nexamine it. The moment I turned the sharp corner of the passage, I saw\r\nmy master coming toward me through the open drawing-room door, asleep\r\nand dreaming, with his keys in his hands. The sliding door behind him\r\nwas open also; and the fear came to me then, and has remained with me\r\never since, that his dream had led him through the Banqueting-Hall into\r\nthe east rooms. We abstained from waking him, and followed his steps\r\nuntil he returned of his own accord to his bed-chamber. The next\r\nmorning, I grieve to say, all the bad symptoms came back; and none of\r\nthe remedies employed have succeeded in getting the better of them yet.\r\nBy the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s advice, we refrained from telling the admiral what had\r\nhappened. He is still under the impression that he passed the night as\r\nusual in his own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been careful to enter into all the particulars of this\r\nunfortunate accident, because neither Mr. Mazey nor myself desire to\r\nscreen ourselves from blame, if blame we have deserved. We both acted\r\nfor the best, and we both beg and pray you will consider our\r\nresponsible situation, and come as soon as possible to St. Crux. Our\r\nhonored master is very hard to manage; and the doctor thinks, as we do,\r\nthat your presence is wanted in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remain, sir, with Mr. Mazey\xe2\x80\x99s respects and my own, your humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSOPHIA DRAKE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nFrom George Bartram to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Crux, April 22d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray excuse my not thanking you sooner for your kind and consoling\r\nletter. We are in sad trouble at St. Crux. Any little irritation I\r\nmight have felt at my poor uncle\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky interference in Portland\r\nPlace is all forgotten in the misfortune of his serious illness. He is\r\nsuffering from internal inflammation, produced by cold; and symptoms\r\nhave shown themselves which are dangerous at his age. A physician from\r\nLondon is now in the house. You shall hear more in a few days.\r\nMeantime, believe me, with sincere gratitude,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours most truly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEORGE BARTRAM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nFrom Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields, May 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have unexpectedly received some information which is of the most\r\nvital importance to your interests. The news of Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nhas reached me this morning. He expired at his own house, on the fourth\r\nof the present month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis event at once disposes of the considerations which I had\r\npreviously endeavored to impress on you, in relation to your discovery\r\nat St. Crux. The wisest course we can now follow is to open\r\ncommunications at once with the executors of the deceased gentleman;\r\naddressing them through the medium of the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s legal adviser, in\r\nthe first instance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have dispatched a letter this day to the solicitor in question. It\r\nsimply warns him that we have lately become aware of the existence of a\r\nprivate Document, controlling the deceased gentleman in his use of the\r\nlegacy devised to him by Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s will. My letter assumes\r\nthat the document will be easily found among the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s papers; and\r\nit mentions that I am the solicitor appointed by Mrs. Noel Vanstone to\r\nreceive communications on her behalf. My object in taking this step is\r\nto cause a search to be instituted for the Trust\xe2\x80\x94in the very probable\r\nevent of the executors not having met with it yet\xe2\x80\x94before the usual\r\nmeasures are adopted for the administration of the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s estate. We\r\nwill threaten legal proceedings, if we find that the object does not\r\nsucceed. But I anticipate no such necessity. Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexecutors must be men of high standing and position; and they will do\r\njustice to you and to themselves in this matter by looking for the\r\nTrust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder these circumstances, you will naturally ask, \xe2\x80\x98What are our\r\nprospects when the document is found?\xe2\x80\x99 Our prospects have a bright side\r\nand a dark side. Let us take the bright side to begin with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we actually know?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know, first, that the Trust does really exist. Secondly, that there\r\nis a provision in it relating to the marriage of Mr. George Bartram in\r\na given time. Thirdly, that the time (six months from the date of your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s death) expired on the third of this month. Fourthly, that Mr.\r\nGeorge Bartram (as I have found out by inquiry, in the absence of any\r\npositive information on the subject possessed by yourself) is, at the\r\npresent moment, a single man. The conclusion naturally follows, that\r\nthe object contemplated by the Trust, in this case, is an object that\r\nhas failed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf no other provisions have been inserted in the document\xe2\x80\x94or if, being\r\ninserted, those other provisions should be discovered to have failed\r\nalso\xe2\x80\x94I believe it to be impossible (especially if evidence can be found\r\nthat the admiral himself considered the Trust binding on him) for the\r\nexecutors to deal with your husband\xe2\x80\x99s fortune as legally forming part\r\nof Admiral Bartram\xe2\x80\x99s estate. The legacy is expressly declared to have\r\nbeen left to him, on the understanding that he applies it to certain\r\nstated objects\xe2\x80\x94and those objects have failed. What is to be done with\r\nthe money? It was not left to the admiral himself, on the testator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown showing; and the purposes for which it _was_ left have not been,\r\nand cannot be, carried out. I believe (if the case here supposed really\r\nhappens) that the money must revert to the testator\xe2\x80\x99s estate. In that\r\nevent the Law, dealing with it as a matter of necessity, divides it\r\ninto two equal portions. One half goes to Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s childless\r\nwidow, and the other half is divided among Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s next of\r\nkin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will no doubt discover the obvious objection to the case in our\r\nfavor, as I have here put it. You will see that it depends for its\r\npractical realization not on one contingency, but on a series of\r\ncontingencies, which must all happen exactly as we wish them to happen.\r\nI admit the force of the objection; but I can tell you, at the same\r\ntime, that these said contingencies are by no means so improbable as\r\nthey may look on the face of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have every reason to believe that the Trust, like the Will, was\r\n_not_ drawn by a lawyer. That is one circumstance in our favor that is\r\nenough of itself to cast a doubt on the soundness of all, or any, of\r\nthe remaining provisions which we may not be acquainted with. Another\r\nchance which we may count on is to be found, as I think, in that\r\nstrange handwriting, placed under the signature on the third page of\r\nthe Letter, which you saw, but which you, unhappily, omitted to read.\r\nAll the probabilities point to those lines as written by Admiral\r\nBartram: and the position which they occupy is certainly consistent\r\nwith the theory that they touch the important subject of his own sense\r\nof obligation under the Trust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to raise no false hopes in your mind. I only desire to satisfy\r\nyou that we have a case worth trying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for the dark side of the prospect, I need not enlarge on it. After\r\nwhat I have already written, you will understand that the existence of\r\na sound provision, unknown to us, in the Trust, which has been properly\r\ncarried out by the admiral\xe2\x80\x94or which can be properly carried out by his\r\nrepresentatives\xe2\x80\x94would be necessarily fatal to our hopes. The legacy\r\nwould be, in this case, devoted to the purpose or purposes contemplated\r\nby your husband\xe2\x80\x94and, from that moment, you would have no claim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only to add, that as soon as I hear from the late admiral\xe2\x80\x99s man\r\nof business, you shall know the result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear madam,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaithfully yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN LOSCOMBE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nFrom George Bartram to Miss Garth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Crux, May 15th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS GARTH,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trouble you with another letter: partly to thank you for your kind\r\nexpression of sympathy with me, under the loss that I have sustained;\r\nand partly to tell you of an extraordinary application made to my\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s executors, in which you and Miss Vanstone may both feel\r\ninterested, as Mrs. Noel Vanstone is directly concerned in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowing my own ignorance of legal technicalities, I inclose a copy of\r\nthe application, instead of trying to describe it. You will notice as\r\nsuspicious, that no explanation is given of the manner in which the\r\nalleged discovery of one of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s secrets was made, by persons who\r\nare total strangers to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn being made acquainted with the circumstances, the executors at once\r\napplied to me. I could give them no positive information\xe2\x80\x94for my uncle\r\nnever consulted me on matters of business. But I felt in honor bound to\r\ntell them, that during the last six months of his life, the admiral had\r\noccasionally let fall expressions of impatience in my hearing, which\r\nled to the conclusion that he was annoyed by a private responsibility\r\nof some kind. I also mentioned that he had imposed a very strange\r\ncondition on me\xe2\x80\x94a condition which, in spite of his own assurances to\r\nthe contrary, I was persuaded could not have emanated from himself\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nmarrying within a given time (which time has now expired), or of not\r\nreceiving from him a certain sum of money, which I believed to be the\r\nsame in amount as the sum bequeathed to him in my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s will. The\r\nexecutors agreed with me that these circumstances gave a color of\r\nprobability to an otherwise incredible story; and they decided that a\r\nsearch should be instituted for the Secret Trust, nothing in the\r\nslightest degree resembling this same Trust having been discovered, up\r\nto that time, among the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe search (no trifle in such a house as this) has now been in full\r\nprogress for a week. It is superintended by both the executors, and by\r\nmy uncle\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, who is personally, as well as professionally, known\r\nto Mr. Loscombe (Mrs. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor), and who has been\r\nincluded in the proceedings at the express request of Mr. Loscombe\r\nhimself. Up to this time, nothing whatever has been found. Thousands\r\nand thousands of letters have been examined, and not one of them bears\r\nthe remotest resemblance to the letter we are looking for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother week will bring the search to an end. It is only at my express\r\nrequest that it will be persevered with so long. But as the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerosity has made me sole heir to everything he possessed, I feel\r\nbound to do the fullest justice to the interests of others, however\r\nhostile to myself those interests may be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this view, I have not hesitated to reveal to the lawyer a\r\nconstitutional peculiarity of my poor uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, which was always kept a\r\nsecret among us at his own request\xe2\x80\x94I mean his tendency to somnambulism.\r\nI mentioned that he had been discovered (by the housekeeper and his old\r\nservant) walking in his sleep, about three weeks before his death, and\r\nthat the part of the house in which he had been seen, and the basket of\r\nkeys which he was carrying in his hand, suggested the inference that he\r\nhad come from one of the rooms in the east wing, and that he might have\r\nopened some of the pieces of furniture in one of them. I surprised the\r\nlawyer (who seemed to be quite ignorant of the extraordinary actions\r\nconstantly performed by somnambulists), by informing him that my uncle\r\ncould find his way about the house, lock and unlock doors, and remove\r\nobjects of all kinds from one place to another, as easily in his sleep\r\nas in his waking hours. And I declared that, while I felt the faintest\r\ndoubt in my own mind whether he might not have been dreaming of the\r\nTrust on the night in question, and putting the dream in action in his\r\nsleep, I should not feel satisfied unless the rooms in the east wing\r\nwere searched again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only right to add that there is not the least foundation in fact\r\nfor this idea of mine. During the latter part of his fatal illness, my\r\npoor uncle was quite incapable of speaking on any subject whatever.\r\nFrom the time of my arrival at St. Crux, in the middle of last month,\r\nto the time of his death, not a word dropped from him which referred in\r\nthe remotest way to the Secret Trust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere then, for the present, the matter rests. If you think it right to\r\ncommunicate the contents of this letter to Miss Vanstone, pray tell her\r\nthat it will not be my fault if her sister\xe2\x80\x99s assertion (however\r\npreposterous it may seem to my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s executors) is not fairly put to\r\nthe proof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear Miss Garth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways truly yours,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEORGE BARTRAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. S.\xe2\x80\x94As soon as all business matters are settled, I am going abroad\r\nfor some months, to try the relief of change of scene. The house will\r\nbe shut up, and left under the charge of Mrs. Drake. I have not\r\nforgotten your once telling me that you should like to see St. Crux, if\r\nyou ever found yourself in this neighborhood. If you are at all likely\r\nto be in Essex during the time when I am abroad, I have provided\r\nagainst the chance of your being disappointed, by leaving instructions\r\nwith Mrs. Drake to give you, and any friends of yours, the freest\r\nadmission to the house and grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nFrom Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields, May 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a whole fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s search\xe2\x80\x94conducted, I am bound to admit, with\r\nthe most conscientious and unrelaxing care\xe2\x80\x94no such document as the\r\nSecret Trust has been found among the papers left at St. Crux by the\r\nlate Admiral Bartram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder these circumstances, the executors have decided on acting under\r\nthe only recognizable authority which they have to guide them\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nadmiral\xe2\x80\x99s own will. This document (executed some years since) bequeaths\r\nthe whole of his estate, both real and personal (that is to say, all\r\nthe lands he possesses, and all the money he possesses, at the time of\r\nhis death), to his nephew. The will is plain, and the result is\r\ninevitable. Your husband\xe2\x80\x99s fortune is lost to you from this moment. Mr.\r\nGeorge Bartram legally inherits it, as he legally inherits the house\r\nand estate of St. Crux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make no comment upon this extraordinary close to the proceedings.\r\nThe Trust may have been destroyed, or the Trust may be hidden in some\r\nplace of concealment inaccessible to discovery. Either way, it is, in\r\nmy opinion, impossible to found any valid legal declaration on a\r\nknowledge of the document so fragmentary and so incomplete as the\r\nknowledge which you possess. If other lawyers differ from me on this\r\npoint, by all means consult them. I have devoted money enough and time\r\nenough to the unfortunate attempt to assert your interests; and my\r\nconnection with the matter must, from this moment, be considered at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour obedient servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN LOSCOMBE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nFrom Mrs. Ruddock (Lodging-house Keeper) to Mr. Loscombe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPark Terrace, St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Wood,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJune 2d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving, by Mrs. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s directions, taken letters for her to\r\nthe post, addressed to you\xe2\x80\x94and knowing no one else to apply to\xe2\x80\x94I beg to\r\ninquire whether you are acquainted with any of her friends; for I think\r\nit right that they should be stirred up to take some steps about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Vanstone first came to me in November last, when she and her maid\r\noccupied my apartments. On that occasion, and again on this, she has\r\ngiven me no cause to complain of her. She has behaved like a lady, and\r\npaid me my due. I am writing, as a mother of a family, under a sense of\r\nresponsibility\xe2\x80\x94I am not writing with an interested motive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter proper warning given, Mrs. Vanstone (who is now quite alone)\r\nleaves me to-morrow. She has not concealed from me that her\r\ncircumstances are fallen very low, and that she cannot afford to remain\r\nin my house. This is all she has told me\xe2\x80\x94I know nothing of where she is\r\ngoing, or what she means to do next. But I have every reason to believe\r\nshe desires to destroy all traces by which she might be found, after\r\nleaving this place\xe2\x80\x94for I discovered her in tears yesterday, burning\r\nletters which were doubtless letters from her friends. In looks and\r\nconduct she has altered most shockingly in the last week. I believe\r\nthere is some dreadful trouble on her mind; and I am afraid, from what\r\nI see of her, that she is on the eve of a serious illness. It is very\r\nsad to see such a young woman so utterly deserted and friendless as she\r\nis now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my troubling you with this letter; it is on my conscience to\r\nwrite it. If you know any of her relations, please warn them that time\r\nis not to be wasted. If they lose to-morrow, they may lose the last\r\nchance of finding her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour humble servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCATHERINE RUDDOCK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\nFrom Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Ruddock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields, June 2d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMADAM,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy only connection with Mrs. Noel Vanstone was a professional one, and\r\nthat connection is now at an end. I am not acquainted with any of her\r\nfriends; and I cannot undertake to interfere personally, either with\r\nher present or future proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegretting my inability to afford you any assistance, I remain, your\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN LOSCOMBE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST SCENE.\r\nAARON\xe2\x80\x99S BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of June, the owners of the merchantman _Deliverance_\r\nreceived news that the ship had touched at Plymouth to land passengers,\r\nand had then continued her homeward voyage to the Port of London. Five\r\ndays later, the vessel was in the river, and was towed into the East\r\nIndia Docks.\r\n\r\nHaving transacted the business on shore for which he was personally\r\nresponsible, Captain Kirke made the necessary arrangements, by letter,\r\nfor visiting his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s parsonage in Suffolk, on the\r\nseventeenth of the month. As usual in such cases, he received a list of\r\ncommissions to execute for his sister on the day before he left London.\r\nOne of these commissions took him into the neighborhood of Camden Town.\r\nHe drove to his destination from the Docks; and then, dismissing the\r\nvehicle, set forth to walk back southward, toward the New Road.\r\n\r\nHe was not well acquainted with the district; and his attention\r\nwandered further and further away from the scene around him as he went\r\non. His thoughts, roused by the prospect of seeing his sister again,\r\nhad led his memory back to the night when he had parted from her,\r\nleaving the house on foot. The spell so strangely laid on him, in that\r\npast time, had kept its hold through all after-events. The face that\r\nhad haunted him on the lonely road had haunted him again on the lonely\r\nsea. The woman who had followed him, as in a dream, to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor, had followed him\xe2\x80\x94thought of his thought, and spirit of his\r\nspirit\xe2\x80\x94to the deck of his ship. Through storm and calm on the voyage\r\nout, through storm and calm on the voyage home, she had been with him.\r\nIn the ceaseless turmoil of the London streets, she was with him now.\r\nHe knew what the first question on his lips would be, when he had seen\r\nhis sister and her boys. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall try to talk of something else,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when Lizzie and I am alone, it will come out in spite of\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe necessity of waiting to let a string of carts pass at a turning\r\nbefore he crossed awakened him to present things. He looked about in a\r\nmomentary confusion. The street was strange to him; he had lost his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe first foot passenger of whom he inquired appeared to have no time\r\nto waste in giving information. Hurriedly directing him to cross to the\r\nother side of the road, to turn down the first street he came to on his\r\nright hand, and then to ask again, the stranger unceremoniously\r\nhastened on without waiting to be thanked.\r\n\r\nKirke followed his directions and took the turning on his right. The\r\nstreet was short and narrow, and the houses on either side were of the\r\npoorer order. He looked up as he passed the corner to see what the name\r\nof the place might be. It was called \xe2\x80\x9cAaron\xe2\x80\x99s Buildings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLow down on the side of the \xe2\x80\x9cBuildings\xe2\x80\x9d along which he was walking, a\r\nlittle crowd of idlers was assembled round two cabs, both drawn up\r\nbefore the door of the same house. Kirke advanced to the crowd, to ask\r\nhis way of any civil stranger among them who might _not_ be in a hurry\r\nthis time. On approaching the cabs, he found a woman disputing with the\r\ndrivers; and heard enough to inform him that two vehicles had been sent\r\nfor by mistake, where only one was wanted.\r\n\r\nThe house door was open; and when he turned that way next, he looked\r\neasily into the passage, over the heads of the people in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe sight that met his eyes should have been shielded in pity from the\r\nobservation of the street. He saw a slatternly girl, with a frightened\r\nface, standing by an old chair placed in the middle of the passage, and\r\nholding a woman on the chair, too weak and helpless to support\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94a woman apparently in the last stage of illness, who was about\r\nto be removed, when the dispute outside was ended, in one of the cabs.\r\nHer head was drooping when he first saw her, and an old shawl which\r\ncovered it had fallen forward so as to hide the upper part of her face.\r\n\r\nBefore he could look away again, the girl in charge of her raised her\r\nhead and restored the shawl to its place. The action disclosed her face\r\nto view, for an instant only, before her head drooped once more on her\r\nbosom. In that instant he saw the woman whose beauty was the haunting\r\nremembrance of his life\xe2\x80\x94whose image had been vivid in his mind not five\r\nminutes since.\r\n\r\nThe shock of the double recognition\xe2\x80\x94the recognition, at the same\r\nmoment, of the face, and of the dreadful change in it\xe2\x80\x94struck him\r\nspeechless and helpless. The steady presence of mind in all emergencies\r\nwhich had become a habit of his life, failed him for the first time.\r\nThe poverty-stricken street, the squalid mob round the door, swam\r\nbefore his eyes. He staggered back and caught at the iron railings of\r\nthe house behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they taking her to?\xe2\x80\x9d he heard a woman ask, close at his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the hospital, if they will have her,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to the\r\nwork-house, if they won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat horrible answer roused him. He pushed his way through the crowd\r\nand entered the house.\r\n\r\nThe misunderstanding on the pavement had been set right, and one of the\r\ncabs had driven off.\r\n\r\nAs he crossed the threshold of the door he confronted the people of the\r\nhouse at the moment when they were moving her. The cabman who had\r\nremained was on one side of the chair, and the woman who had been\r\ndisputing with the two drivers was on the other. They were just lifting\r\nher, when Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s tall figure darkened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing with that lady?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe cabman looked up with the insolence of his reply visible in his\r\neyes, before his lips could utter it. But the woman, quicker than he,\r\nsaw the suppressed agitation in Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s face, and dropped her hold of\r\nthe chair in an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know her, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the woman, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you one of her\r\nfriends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirke, without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the woman, shirking under the look he\r\nfixed on her. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have waited patiently till her friends found\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94I would, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKirke made no reply. He turned, and spoke to the cabman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand close the door after you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you down\r\nyour money directly. What room in the house did you take her from, when\r\nyou brought her here?\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, addressing himself to the woman\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first floor back, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me the way to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stooped, and lifted Magdalen in his arms. Her head rested gently on\r\nthe sailor\xe2\x80\x99s breast; her eyes looked up wonderingly into the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface. She smiled, and whispered to him vacantly. Her mind had wandered\r\nback to old days at home; and her few broken words showed that she\r\nfancied herself a child again in her father\xe2\x80\x99s arms. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor papa!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, softly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you look so sorry? Poor papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman led the way into the back room on the first floor. It was\r\nvery small; it was miserably furnished. But the little bed was clean,\r\nand the few things in the room were neatly kept. Kirke laid her\r\ntenderly on the bed. She caught one of his hands in her burning\r\nfingers. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t distress mamma about me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSend for Norah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nKirke tried gently to release his hand; but she only clasped it the\r\nmore eagerly. He sat down by the bedside to wait until it pleased her\r\nto release him. The woman stood looking at them and crying, in a corner\r\nof the room. Kirke observed her attentively. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after an\r\ninterval, in low, quiet tones. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak in _her_ presence; and tell me\r\nthe truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith many words, with many tears, the woman spoke.\r\n\r\nShe had let her first floor to the lady a fortnight since. The lady had\r\npaid a week\xe2\x80\x99s rent, and had given the name of Gray. She had been out\r\nfrom morning till night, for the first three days, and had come home\r\nagain, on every occasion, with a wretchedly weary, disappointed look.\r\nThe woman of the house had suspected that she was in hiding from her\r\nfriends, under a false name; and that she had been vainly trying to\r\nraise money, or to get some employment, on the three days when she was\r\nout for so long, and when she looked so disappointed on coming home.\r\nHowever that might be, on the fourth day she had fallen ill, with\r\nshivering fits and hot fits, turn and turn about. On the fifth day she\r\nwas worse; and on the sixth, she was too sleepy at one time, and too\r\nlight-headed at another, to be spoken to. The chemist (who did the\r\ndoctoring in those parts) had come and looked at her, and had said he\r\nthought it was a bad fever. He had left a \xe2\x80\x9csaline draught,\xe2\x80\x9d which the\r\nwoman of the house had paid for out of her own pocket, and had\r\nadministered without effect. She had ventured on searching the only box\r\nwhich the lady had brought with her; and had found nothing in it but a\r\nfew necessary articles of linen\xe2\x80\x94no dresses, no ornaments, not so much\r\nas the fragment of a letter which might help in discovering her\r\nfriends. Between the risk of keeping her under these circumstances, and\r\nthe barbarity of turning a sick woman into the street, the landlady\r\nherself had not hesitated. She would willingly have kept her tenant, on\r\nthe chance of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, and on the chance of her friends\r\nturning up. But not half an hour since, her husband\xe2\x80\x94who never came near\r\nthe house, except to take her money\xe2\x80\x94had come to rob her of her little\r\nearnings, as usual. She had been obliged to tell him that no rent was\r\nin hand for the first floor, and that none was likely to be in hand\r\nuntil the lady recovered, or her friends found her. On hearing this, he\r\nhad mercilessly insisted\xe2\x80\x94well or ill\xe2\x80\x94that the lady should go. There was\r\nthe hospital to take her to; and if the hospital shut its doors, there\r\nwas the workhouse to try next. If she was not out of the place in an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s time, he threatened to come back and take her out himself. His\r\nwife knew but too well that he was brute enough to be as good as his\r\nword; and no other choice had been left her but to do as she had done,\r\nfor the sake of the lady herself.\r\n\r\nThe woman told her shocking story, with every appearance of being\r\nhonestly ashamed of it. Toward the end, Kirke felt the clasp of the\r\nburning fingers slackening round his hand. He looked back at the bed\r\nagain. Her weary eyes were closing; and, with her face still turned\r\ntoward the sailor, she was sinking into sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any one in the front room?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirke, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nin there; I have something to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman followed him through the door of communication between the\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much does she owe you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe landlady mentioned the sum. Kirke put it down before her on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d was his next question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiting at the public-house, sir, till the hour is up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can take him the money or not, as you think right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirke,\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have only one thing to tell you, as far as your husband is\r\nconcerned. If you want to see every bone in his skin broken, let him\r\ncome to the house while I am in it. Stop! I have something more to say.\r\nDo you know of any doctor in the neighborhood who can be depended on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in our neighborhood, sir. But I know of one within half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalk of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the cab at the door; and, if you find him at home, bring him back\r\nin it. Say I am waiting here for his opinion on a very serious case. He\r\nshall be well paid, and you shall be well paid. Make haste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman left the room.\r\n\r\nKirke sat down alone, to wait for her return. He hid his face in his\r\nhands, and tried to realize the strange and touching situation in which\r\nthe accident of a moment had placed him.\r\n\r\nHidden in the squalid by-ways of London under a false name; cast,\r\nfriendless and helpless, on the mercy of strangers, by illness which\r\nhad struck her prostrate, mind and body alike\xe2\x80\x94so he met her again, the\r\nwoman who had opened a new world of beauty to his mind; the woman who\r\nhad called Love to life in him by a look! What horrible misfortune had\r\nstruck her so cruelly, and struck her so low? What mysterious destiny\r\nhad guided him to the last refuge of her poverty and despair, in the\r\nhour of her sorest need? \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is ordered that I am to see her again,\r\nI _shall_ see her.\xe2\x80\x9d Those words came back to him now\xe2\x80\x94the memorable\r\nwords that he had spoken to his sister at parting. With that thought in\r\nhis heart, he had gone where his duty called him. Months and months had\r\npassed; thousands and thousands of miles, protracting their desolate\r\nlength on the unresting waters had rolled between them. And through the\r\nlapse of time, and over the waste of oceans\xe2\x80\x94day after day, and night\r\nafter night, as the winds of heaven blew, and the good ship toiled on\r\nbefore them\xe2\x80\x94he had advanced nearer and nearer to the end that was\r\nwaiting for him; he had journeyed blindfold to the meeting on the\r\nthreshold of that miserable door. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has brought me here?\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nto himself in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mercy of chance? No. The mercy of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited, unregardful of the place, unconscious of the time, until the\r\nsound of footsteps on the stairs came suddenly between him and his\r\nthoughts. The door opened, and the doctor was shown into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Merrick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady, placing a chair for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mr._ Merrick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor, smiling quietly as he took the\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a physician\xe2\x80\x94I am a surgeon in general practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhysician or surgeon, there was something in his face and manner which\r\ntold Kirke at a glance that he was a man to be relied on.\r\n\r\nAfter a few preliminary words on either side, Mr. Merrick sent the\r\nlandlady into the bedroom to see if his patient was awake or asleep.\r\nThe woman returned, and said she was \xe2\x80\x9cbetwixt the two, light in the\r\nhead again, and burning hot.\xe2\x80\x9d The doctor went at once into the bedroom,\r\ntelling the landlady to follow him, and to close the door behind her.\r\n\r\nA weary time passed before he came back into the front room. When he\r\nre-appeared, his face spoke for him, before any question could be\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a serious illness?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirke his voice sinking low, his eyes\r\nanxiously fixed on the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a _dangerous_ illness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Merrick, with an emphasis on\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair nearer to Kirke and looked at him attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask you some questions which are not strictly medical?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\nKirke bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me what her life has been before she came into this\r\nhouse, and before she fell ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no means of knowing. I have just returned to England after a\r\nlong absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know of her coming here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only discovered it by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she no female relations? No mother? no sister? no one to take care\r\nof her but yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one\xe2\x80\x94unless I can succeed in tracing her relations. No one but\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Merrick was silent. He looked at Kirke more attentively than ever.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is here, in sole charge of her\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nis this all he knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKirke saw the doubt in his face; and addressed himself straight to that\r\ndoubt, before another word passed between them,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see my position here surprises you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, simply. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you\r\nconsider it the position of a relation\xe2\x80\x94the position of her brother or\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x94until her friends can be found?\xe2\x80\x9d His voice faltered, and he\r\nlaid his hand earnestly on the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI have taken this trust\r\non myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand as God shall judge me, I will not be unworthy\r\nof it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor weary head lay on his breast again, the poor fevered fingers\r\nclasped his hand once more, as he spoke those words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are an honest\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x94Pardon me if I have seemed to intrude myself on your confidence. I\r\nrespect your reserve\xe2\x80\x94from this moment it is sacred to me. In justice to\r\nboth of us, let me say that the questions I have asked were not\r\nprompted by mere curiosity. No common cause will account for the\r\nillness which has laid my patient on that bed. She has suffered some\r\nlong-continued mental trial, some wearing and terrible suspense\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nhas broken down under it. It might have helped me if I could have known\r\nwhat the nature of the trial was, and how long or how short a time\r\nelapsed before she sank under it. In that hope I spoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you told me she was dangerously ill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirke, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you mean\r\ndanger to her reason or to her life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo both,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Merrick. \xe2\x80\x9cHer whole nervous system has given\r\nway; all the ordinary functions of her brain are in a state of\r\ncollapse. I can give you no plainer explanation than that of the nature\r\nof the malady. The fever which frightens the people of the house is\r\nmerely the effect. The cause is what I have told you. She may lie on\r\nthat bed for weeks to come; passing alternately, without a gleam of\r\nconsciousness, from a state of delirium to a state of repose. You must\r\nnot be alarmed if you find her sleep lasting far beyond the natural\r\ntime. That sleep is a better remedy than any I can give, and nothing\r\nmust disturb it. All our art can accomplish is to watch her, to help\r\nher with stimulants from time to time, and to wait for what Nature will\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust she remain here? Is there no hope of our being able to remove her\r\nto a better place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo hope whatever, for the present. She has already been disturbed, as\r\nI understand, and she is seriously the worse for it. Even if she gets\r\nbetter, even if she comes to herself again, it would still be a\r\ndangerous experiment to move her too soon\xe2\x80\x94the least excitement or alarm\r\nwould be fatal to her. You must make the best of this place as it is.\r\nThe landlady has my directions; and I will send a good nurse to help\r\nher. There is nothing more to be done. So far as her life can be said\r\nto be in any human hands, it is as much in your hands now as in mine.\r\nEverything depends on the care that is taken of her, under your\r\ndirection, in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d With those farewell words he rose and\r\nquitted the room.\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Kirke walked to the door of communication, and,\r\nknocking at it softly, told the landlady he wished to speak with her.\r\n\r\nHe was far more composed, far more like his own resolute self, after\r\nhis interview with the doctor, than he had been before it. A man living\r\nin the artificial social atmosphere which _this_ man had never breathed\r\nwould have felt painfully the worldly side of the situation\xe2\x80\x94its novelty\r\nand strangeness; the serious present difficulty in which it placed him;\r\nthe numberless misinterpretations in the future to which it might lead.\r\nKirke never gave the situation a thought. He saw nothing but the duty\r\nit claimed from him\xe2\x80\x94a duty which the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s farewell words had put\r\nplainly before his mind. Everything depended on the care taken of her,\r\nunder his direction, in that house. There was his responsibility, and\r\nhe unconsciously acted under it, exactly as he would have acted in a\r\ncase of emergency with women and children on board his own ship. He\r\nquestioned the landlady in short, sharp sentences; the only change in\r\nhim was in the lowered tone of his voice, and in the anxious looks\r\nwhich he cast, from time to time, at the room where she lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand what the doctor has told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house must be kept quiet. Who lives in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly me and my daughter, sir; we live in the parlors. Times have gone\r\nbadly with us since Lady Day. Both the rooms above this are to let.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take them both, and the two rooms down here as well. Do you\r\nknow of any active trustworthy man who can run on errands for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. Shall I go\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; let your daughter go. You must not leave the house until the nurse\r\ncomes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t send the messenger up here. Men of that sort tread\r\nheavily. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down, and speak to him at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went down when the messenger came, and sent him first to purchase\r\npen, ink, and paper. The man\xe2\x80\x99s next errand dispatched him to make\r\ninquiries for a person who could provide for deadening the sound of\r\npassing wheels in the street by laying down tan before the house in the\r\nusual way. This object accomplished, the messenger received two letters\r\nto post. The first was addressed to Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law. It told\r\nhim, in few and plain words, what had happened; and left him to break\r\nthe news to his wife as he thought best. The second letter was directed\r\nto the landlord of the Aldborough Hotel. Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s assumed name at\r\nNorth Shingles was the only name by which Kirke knew her; and the one\r\nchance of tracing her relatives that he could discern was the chance of\r\ndiscovering her reputed uncle and aunt by means of inquiries starting\r\nfrom Aldborough.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the afternoon a decent middle-aged woman came to\r\nthe house, with a letter from Mr. Merrick. She was well known to the\r\ndoctor as a trustworthy and careful person, who had nursed his own\r\nwife; and she would be assisted, from time to time, by a lady who was a\r\nmember of a religious Sisterhood in the district, and whose\r\ncompassionate interest had been warmly aroused in the case. Toward\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening the doctor himself would call and see that\r\nhis patient wanted for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the nurse, and the relief of knowing that she was to be\r\ntrusted, left Kirke free to think of himself. His luggage was ready\r\npacked for his contemplated journey to Suffolk the next day. It was\r\nmerely necessary to transport it from the hotel to the house in Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBuildings.\r\n\r\nHe stopped once only on his way to the hotel to look at a toyshop in\r\none of the great thoroughfares. The miniature ships in the window\r\nreminded him of his nephew. \xe2\x80\x9cMy little name-sake will be sadly\r\ndisappointed at not seeing me to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI must make it\r\nup to the boy by sending him something from his uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d He went into\r\nthe shop and bought one of the ships. It was secured in a box, and\r\npacked and directed in his presence. He put a card on the deck of the\r\nminiature vessel before the cover of the box was nailed on, bearing\r\nthis inscription: \xe2\x80\x9cA ship for the little sailor, with the big sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cChildren like to be written to, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\napologetically, to the woman behind the counter. \xe2\x80\x9cSend the box as soon\r\nas you can\xe2\x80\x94I am anxious the boy should get it to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToward the dusk of the evening he returned with his luggage to Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBuildings. He took off his boots in the passage and carried his trunk\r\nupstairs himself; stopping, as he passed the first floor, to make his\r\ninquiries. Mr. Merrick was present to answer them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was awake and wandering,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9ca few minutes since.\r\nBut we have succeeded in composing her, and she is sleeping now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave no words escaped her, sir, which might help us to find her\r\nfriends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Merrick shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeeks and weeks may pass yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand that poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s story\r\nmay still be a sealed secret to all of us. We can only wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the day ended\xe2\x80\x94the first of many days that were to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe warm sunlight of July shining softly through a green blind; an open\r\nwindow with fresh flowers set on the sill; a strange bed, in a strange\r\nroom; a giant figure of the female sex (like a dream of Mrs. Wragge)\r\ntowering aloft on one side of the bed, and trying to clap its hands;\r\nanother woman (quickly) stopping the hands before they could make any\r\nnoise; a mild expostulating voice (like a dream of Mrs. Wragge again)\r\nbreaking the silence in these words, \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, she knows\r\nme; if I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be happy, it will be the death of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94such were the\r\nfirst sights, such were the first sounds, to which, after six weeks of\r\noblivion, Magdalen suddenly and strangely awoke.\r\n\r\nAfter a little, the sights grew dim again, and the sounds sank into\r\nsilence. Sleep, the merciful, took her once more, and hushed her back\r\nto repose.\r\n\r\nAnother day\xe2\x80\x94and the sights were clearer, the sounds were louder.\r\nAnother\xe2\x80\x94and she heard a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, through the door, asking for news\r\nfrom the sick-room. The voice was strange to her; it was always\r\ncautiously lowered to the same quiet tone. It inquired after her, in\r\nthe morning, when she woke\xe2\x80\x94at noon, when she took her refreshment\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe evening, before she dropped asleep again. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is so anxious about\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d That was the first thought her mind was strong enough to form\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nis so anxious about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore days\xe2\x80\x94and she could speak to the nurse at her bedside; she could\r\nanswer the questions of an elderly man, who knew far more about her\r\nthan she knew about herself, and who told her he was Mr. Merrick, the\r\ndoctor; she could sit up in bed, supported by pillows, wondering what\r\nhad happened to her, and where she was; she could feel a growing\r\ncuriosity about that quiet voice, which still asked after her, morning,\r\nnoon, and night, on the other side of the door.\r\n\r\nAnother day\xe2\x80\x99s delay\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Merrick asked her if she was strong enough\r\nto see an old friend. A meek voice, behind him, articulating high in\r\nthe air, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only me.\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was followed by the prodigious\r\nbodily apparition of Mrs. Wragge, with her cap all awry, and one of her\r\nshoes in the next room. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, look at her! look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs.\r\nWragge, in an ecstasy, dropping on her knees at Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s bedside,\r\nwith a thump that shook the house. \xe2\x80\x9cBless her heart, she\xe2\x80\x99s well enough\r\nto laugh at me already. \xe2\x80\x98Cheer, boys, cheer\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x99 I beg your pardon,\r\ndoctor, my conduct isn\xe2\x80\x99t ladylike, I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s my head, sir; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_me._ I must give vent somehow, or my head will burst!\xe2\x80\x9d No coherent\r\nsentence, in answer to any sort of question put to her, could be\r\nextracted that morning from Mrs. Wragge. She rose from one climax of\r\nverbal confusion to another\xe2\x80\x94and finished her visit under the bed,\r\ngroping inscrutably for the second shoe.\r\n\r\nThe morrow came\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Merrick promised that she should see another\r\nold friend on the next day. In the evening, when the inquiring voice\r\nasked after her, as usual, and when the door was opened a few inches to\r\ngive the reply, she answered faintly for herself: \xe2\x80\x9cI am better, thank\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a moment of silence\xe2\x80\x94and then, just as the door was shut\r\nagain, the voice sank to a whisper, and said, fervently, \xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWho was he? She had asked them all, and no one would tell her. Who was\r\nhe?\r\n\r\nThe next day came; and she heard her door opened softly. Brisk\r\nfootsteps tripped into the room; a lithe little figure advanced to the\r\nbed-side. Was it a dream again? No! There he was in his own evergreen\r\nreality, with the copious flow of language pouring smoothly from his\r\nlips; with the lambent dash of humor twinkling in his party-colored\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94there he was, more audacious, more persuasive, more respectable\r\nthan ever, in a suit of glossy black, with a speckless white cravat,\r\nand a rampant shirt frill\xe2\x80\x94the unblushing, the invincible, unchangeable\r\nWragge!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word, my dear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, seating himself\r\ncomfortably at the bedside, in his old confidential way. \xe2\x80\x9cI am to do\r\nall the talking; and, I think you will own, a more competent man for\r\nthe purpose could not possibly have been found. I am really\r\ndelighted\xe2\x80\x94honestly delighted, if I may use such an apparently\r\ninappropriate word\xe2\x80\x94to see you again, and to see you getting well. I\r\nhave often thought of you; I have often missed you; I have often said\r\nto myself\xe2\x80\x94never mind what! Clear the stage, and drop the curtain on the\r\npast. _Dum vivimus, vivamus!_ Pardon the pedantry of a Latin quotation,\r\nmy dear, and tell me how I look. Am I, or am I not, the picture of a\r\nprosperous man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen attempted to answer him. The captain\xe2\x80\x99s deluge of words flowed\r\nover her again in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t exert yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put all your questions for you.\r\nWhat have I been about? Why do I look so remarkably well off? And how\r\nin the world did I find my way to this house? My dear girl, I have been\r\noccupied, since we last saw each other, in slightly modifying my old\r\nprofessional habits. I have shifted from Moral Agriculture to Medical\r\nAgriculture. Formerly I preyed on the public sympathy, now I prey on\r\nthe public stomach. Stomach and sympathy, sympathy and stomach\xe2\x80\x94look\r\nthem both fairly in the face when you reach the wrong side of fifty,\r\nand you will agree with me that they come to much the same thing.\r\nHowever that may be, here I am\xe2\x80\x94incredible as it may appear\xe2\x80\x94a man with\r\nan income, at last. The founders of my fortune are three in number.\r\nTheir names are Aloes, Scammony, and Gamboge. In plainer words, I am\r\nnow living\xe2\x80\x94on a Pill. I made a little money (if you remember) by my\r\nfriendly connection with you. I made a little more by the happy decease\r\n(_Requiescat in Pace!_) of that female relative of Mrs. Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s from\r\nwhom, as I told you, my wife had expectations. Very good. What do you\r\nthink I did? I invested the whole of my capital, at one fell swoop, in\r\nadvertisements, and purchased my drugs and my pill-boxes on credit. The\r\nresult is now before you. Here I am, a Grand Financial Fact. Here I am,\r\nwith my clothes positively paid for; with a balance at my banker\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nwith my servant in livery, and my gig at the door; solvent,\r\nflourishing, popular\xe2\x80\x94and all on a Pill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagdalen smiled. The captain\xe2\x80\x99s face assumed an expression of mock\r\ngravity; he looked as if there was a serious side to the question, and\r\nas if he meant to put it next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no laughing matter to the public, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget rid of me and my Pill; they must take us. There is not a single\r\nform of appeal in the whole range of human advertisement which I am not\r\nmaking to the unfortunate public at this moment. Hire the last new\r\nnovel, there I am, inside the boards of the book. Send for the last new\r\nSong\xe2\x80\x94the instant you open the leaves, I drop out of it. Take a cab\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nfly in at the window in red. Buy a box of tooth-powder at the\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94I wrap it up for you in blue. Show yourself at the theater\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nflutter down on you in yellow. The mere titles of my advertisements are\r\nquite irresistible. Let me quote a few from last week\xe2\x80\x99s issue.\r\nProverbial Title: \xe2\x80\x98A Pill in time saves Nine.\xe2\x80\x99 Familiar Title: \xe2\x80\x98Excuse\r\nme, how is your Stomach?\xe2\x80\x99 Patriotic Title: \xe2\x80\x98What are the three\r\ncharacteristics of a true-born Englishman? His Hearth, his Home, and\r\nhis Pill.\xe2\x80\x99 Title in the form of a nursery dialogue: \xe2\x80\x98Mamma, I am not\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What is the matter, my pet?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I want a little Pill.\xe2\x80\x99 Title in\r\nthe form of a Historical Anecdote: \xe2\x80\x98New Discovery in the Mine of\r\nEnglish History. When the Princes were smothered in the Tower, their\r\nfaithful attendant collected all their little possessions left behind\r\nthem. Among the touching trifles dear to the poor boys, he found a tiny\r\nBox. It contained the Pill of the Period. Is it necessary to say how\r\ninferior that Pill was to its Successor, which prince and peasant alike\r\nmay now obtain?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Et cetera, et cetera. The place in which my Pill is\r\nmade is an advertisement in itself. I have got one of the largest shops\r\nin London. Behind one counter (visible to the public through the lucid\r\nmedium of plate-glass) are four-and-twenty young men, in white aprons,\r\nmaking the Pill. Behind another counter are four-and-twenty young men,\r\nin white cravats, making the boxes. At the bottom of the shop are three\r\nelderly accountants, posting the vast financial transactions accruing\r\nfrom the Pill in three enormous ledgers. Over the door are my name,\r\nportrait, and autograph, expanded to colossal proportions, and\r\nsurrounded in flowing letters, by the motto of the establishment, \xe2\x80\x98Down\r\nwith the Doctors!\xe2\x80\x99 Even Mrs. Wragge contributes her quota to this\r\nprodigious enterprise. She is the celebrated woman whom I have cured of\r\nindescribable agonies from every complaint under the sun. Her portrait\r\nis engraved on all the wrappers, with the following inscription beneath\r\nit: \xe2\x80\x98Before she took the Pill you might have blown this patient away\r\nwith a feather. Look at her now!!!\xe2\x80\x99 Last, not least, my dear girl, the\r\nPill is the cause of my finding my way to this house. My department in\r\nthe prodigious Enterprise already mentioned is to scour the United\r\nKingdom in a gig, establishing Agencies everywhere. While founding one\r\nof those Agencies, I heard of a certain friend of mine, who had lately\r\nlanded in England, after a long sea-voyage. I got his address in\r\nLondon\xe2\x80\x94he was a lodger in this house. I called on him forthwith, and\r\nwas stunned by the news of your illness. Such, in brief, is the history\r\nof my existing connection with British Medicine; and so it happens that\r\nyou see me at the present moment sitting in the present chair, now as\r\never, yours truly, Horatio Wragge.\xe2\x80\x9d In these terms the captain brought\r\nhis personal statement to a close. He looked more and more attentively\r\nat Magdalen, the nearer he got to the conclusion. Was there some latent\r\nimportance attaching to his last words which did not appear on the face\r\nof them? There was. His visit to the sick-room had a serious object,\r\nand that object he had now approached.\r\n\r\nIn describing the circumstances under which he had become acquainted\r\nwith Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s present position, Captain Wragge had skirted, with his\r\ncustomary dexterity, round the remote boundaries of truth. Emboldened\r\nby the absence of any public scandal in connection with Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage, or with the event of his death as announced in the newspaper\r\nobituary, the captain, roaming the eastern circuit, had ventured back\r\nto Aldborough a fortnight since, to establish an agency there for the\r\nsale of his wonderful Pill. No one had recognized him but the landlady\r\nof the hotel, who at once insisted on his entering the house and\r\nreading Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s letter to her husband. The same night Captain Wragge\r\nwas in London, and was closeted with the sailor in the second-floor\r\nroom at Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s Buildings.\r\n\r\nThe serious nature of the situation, the indisputable certainty that\r\nKirke must fail in tracing Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s friends unless he first knew who\r\nshe really was, had decided the captain on disclosing part, at least,\r\nof the truth. Declining to enter into any particulars\xe2\x80\x94for family\r\nreasons, which Magdalen might explain on her recovery, if she\r\npleased\xe2\x80\x94he astounded Kirke by telling him that the friendless woman\r\nwhom he had rescued, and whom he had only known up to that moment as\r\nMiss Bygrave\xe2\x80\x94was no other than the youngest daughter of Andrew\r\nVanstone. The disclosure, on Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s side, of his father\xe2\x80\x99s connection\r\nwith the young officer in Canada, had followed naturally on the\r\nrevelation of Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s real name. Captain Wragge had expressed his\r\nsurprise, but had made no further remark at the time. A fortnight\r\nlater, however, when the patient\xe2\x80\x99s recovery forced the serious\r\ndifficulty on the doctor of meeting the questions which Magdalen was\r\nsure to ask, the captain\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity had come, as usual, to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t tell her the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout awakening painful\r\nrecollections of her stay at Aldborough, into which I am not at liberty\r\nto enter. Don\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge just yet that Mr. Kirke only knew her as\r\nMiss Bygrave of North Shingles when he found her in this house. Tell\r\nher boldly that he knew who she was, and that he felt (what she must\r\nfeel) that he had a hereditary right to help and protect her as his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s son. I am, as I have already told you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain,\r\nsticking fast to his old assertion, \xe2\x80\x9ca distant relative of the\r\nCombe-Raven family; and, if there is nobody else at hand to help you\r\nthrough this difficulty, my services are freely at your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one else was at hand, and the emergency was a serious one. Strangers\r\nundertaking the responsibility might ignorantly jar on past\r\nrecollections, which it would, perhaps, be the death of her to revive\r\ntoo soon. Near relatives might, by their premature appearance at the\r\nbedside, produce the same deplorable result. The alternative lay\r\nbetween irritating and alarming her by leaving her inquiries\r\nunanswered, or trusting Captain Wragge. In the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, the\r\nsecond risk was the least serious risk of the two\xe2\x80\x94and the captain was\r\nnow seated at Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s bedside in discharge of the trust confided to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWould she ask the question which it had been the private object of all\r\nCaptain Wragge\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary talk lightly and pleasantly to provoke?\r\nYes; as soon as his silence gave her the opportunity, she asked it:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was that friend of his living in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought by rights to know him as well as I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the son of one of your father\xe2\x80\x99s old military friends, when your\r\nfather was quartered with his regiment in Canada. Your cheeks mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nflush up! If they do, I shall go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was astonished, but not agitated. Captain Wragge had begun by\r\ninteresting her in the remote past, which she only knew by hearsay,\r\nbefore he ventured on the delicate ground of her own experience.\r\n\r\nIn a moment more she advanced to her next question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was his\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKirke,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you never hear of his father,\r\nMajor Kirke, commanding officer of the regiment in Canada? Did you\r\nnever hear that the major helped your father through a great\r\ndifficulty, like the best of good fellows and good friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes; she faintly fancied she had heard something about her father and\r\nan officer who had once been very good to him when he was a young man.\r\nBut she could not look back so long. \xe2\x80\x9cWas Mr. Kirke poor?\xe2\x80\x9d Even Captain\r\nWragge\xe2\x80\x99s penetration was puzzled by that question. He gave the true\r\nanswer at hazard. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer next inquiry showed what she had been thinking of. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Kirke\r\nwas not poor, why did he come to live in that house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has caught me!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one way out of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94I must administer another dose of truth. Mr. Kirke discovered you\r\nhere by chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cvery ill, and not nicely\r\nattended to. Somebody was wanted to take care of you while you were not\r\nable to take care of yourself. Why not Mr. Kirke? He was the son of\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s old friend\xe2\x80\x94which is the next thing to being _your_ old\r\nfriend. Who had a better claim to send for the right doctor, and get\r\nthe right nurse, when I was not here to cure you with my wonderful\r\nPill? Gently! gently! you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take hold of my superfine black\r\ncoat-sleeve in that unceremonious manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put her hand back on the bed, but she was not to be checked in that\r\nway. She persisted in asking another question.\xe2\x80\x94How came Mr. Kirke to\r\nknow her? She had never seen him; she had never heard of him in her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wragge. \xe2\x80\x9cBut your never having seen _him_\r\nis no reason why he should not have seen _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did he see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain corked up his doses of truth on the spot without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cSome time ago, my dear. I can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly say when.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Wragge suddenly saw his way to the administration of another\r\ndose. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9conly once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reflected a little. The next question involved the simultaneous\r\nexpression of two ideas, and the next question cost her an effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only saw me once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand he only saw me some time ago. How\r\ncame he to remember me when he found me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you have hit the right nail on the head\r\nat last. You can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be more surprised at his remembering you\r\nthan I am. A word of advice, my dear. When you are well enough to get\r\nup and see Mr. Kirke, try how that sharp question of yours sounds in\r\n_his_ ears, and insist on his answering it himself.\xe2\x80\x9d Slipping out of\r\nthe dilemma in that characteristically adroit manner, Captain Wragge\r\ngot briskly on his legs again and took up his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot another word,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI have given you quite enough to\r\nthink of for one day. My time is up, and my gig is waiting for me. I am\r\noff, to scour the country as usual. I am off, to cultivate the field of\r\npublic indigestion with the triple plowshare of aloes, scammony and\r\ngamboge.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped and turned round at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-by, a\r\nmessage from my unfortunate wife. If you will allow her to come and see\r\nyou again, Mrs. Wragge solemnly promises _not_ to lose her shoe next\r\ntime. _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t believe her. What do you say? May she come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; whenever she likes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I ever get well again,\r\nmay poor Mrs. Wragge come and stay with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my dear. If you have no objection, I will provide her\r\nbeforehand with a few thousand impressions in red, blue, and yellow of\r\nher own portrait (\xe2\x80\x98You might have blown this patient away with a\r\nfeather before she took the Pill. Look at her now!\xe2\x80\x99). She is sure to\r\ndrop herself about perpetually wherever she goes, and the most\r\ngratifying results, in an advertising point of view, must inevitably\r\nfollow. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think me mercenary\xe2\x80\x94I merely understand the age I live\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped on his way out, for the second time, and turned round\r\nonce more at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been a remarkably good girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you deserve to be rewarded for it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a last piece of\r\ninformation before I go. Have you heard anybody inquiring after you,\r\nfor the last day or two, outside your door? Ah! I see you have. A word\r\nin your ear, my dear. That\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Kirke.\xe2\x80\x9d He tripped away from the\r\nbedside as briskly as ever. Magdalen heard him advertising himself to\r\nthe nurse before he closed the door. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are ever asked about it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, in a confidential whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cthe name is Wragge, and the Pill\r\nis to be had in neat boxes, price thirteen pence half-penny, government\r\nstamp included. Take a few copies of the portrait of a female patient,\r\nwhom you might have blown away with a feather before she took the Pill,\r\nand whom you are simply requested to contemplate now. Many thanks.\r\n_Good_-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door closed and Magdalen was alone again. She felt no sense of\r\nsolitude; Captain Wragge had left her with something new to think of.\r\nHour after hour her mind dwelt wonderingly on Mr. Kirke, until the\r\nevening came, and she heard his voice again through the half-opened\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very grateful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him, before the nurse could answer\r\nhis inquiries\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cvery, very grateful for all your goodness to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to get well,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will more than reward me,\r\nif you try to get well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mr. Merrick found her impatient to leave her bed, and\r\nbe moved to the sofa in the front room. The doctor said he supposed she\r\nwanted a change. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see Mr. Kirke.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ndoctor consented to move her on the next day, but he positively forbade\r\nthe additional excitement of seeing anybody until the day after. She\r\nattempted a remonstrance\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Merrick was impenetrable. She tried, when\r\nhe was gone, to win the nurse by persuasion\xe2\x80\x94the nurse was impenetrable,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nOn the next day they wrapped her in shawls, and carried her in to the\r\nsofa, and made her a little bed on it. On the table near at hand were\r\nsome flowers and a number of an illustrated paper. She immediately\r\nasked who had put them there. The nurse (failing to notice a warning\r\nlook from the doctor) said Mr. Kirke had thought that she might like\r\nthe flowers, and that the pictures in the paper might amuse her. After\r\nthat reply, her anxiety to see Mr. Kirke became too ungovernable to be\r\ntrifled with. The doctor left the room at once to fetch him.\r\n\r\nShe looked eagerly at the opening door. Her first glance at him as he\r\ncame in raised a doubt in her mind whether she now saw that tall figure\r\nand that open sun-burned face for the first time. But she was too weak\r\nand too agitated to follow her recollections as far back as Aldborough.\r\nShe resigned the attempt, and only looked at him. He stopped at the\r\nfoot of the sofa and said a few cheering words. She beckoned to him to\r\ncome nearer, and offered him her wasted hand. He tenderly took it in\r\nhis, and sat down by her. They were both silent. His face told her of\r\nthe sorrow and the sympathy which his silence would fain have\r\nconcealed. She still held his hand\xe2\x80\x94consciously now\xe2\x80\x94as persistently as\r\nshe had held it on the day when he found her. Her eyes closed, after a\r\nvain effort to speak to him, and the tears rolled slowly over her wan\r\nwhite cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe doctor signed to Kirke to wait and give her time. She recovered a\r\nlittle and looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cHow kind you have been to me!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how little I have deserved it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a happiness it was to me to\r\nhelp you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice seemed to strengthen her, and to give her\r\ncourage. She lay looking at him with an eager interest, with a\r\ngratitude which artlessly ignored all the conventional restraints that\r\ninterpose between a woman and a man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you see me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nsuddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you found me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKirke hesitated. Mr. Merrick came to his assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forbid you to say a word about the past to Mr. Kirke,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed\r\nthe doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cand I forbid Mr. Kirke to say a word about it to _you._\r\nYou are beginning a new life to-day, and the only recollections I\r\nsanction are recollections five minutes old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at the doctor and smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI must ask him one question,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, and turned back again to Kirke. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it true that you had only\r\nseen me once before you came to this house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite true!\xe2\x80\x9d He made the reply with a sudden change of color which she\r\ninstantly detected. Her brightening eyes looked at him more earnestly\r\nthan ever, as she put her next question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came you to remember me after only seeing me once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hand unconsciously closed on hers, and pressed it for the first\r\ntime. He attempted to answer, and hesitated at the first word. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\na good memory,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last; and suddenly looked away from her with\r\na confusion so strangely unlike his customary self-possession of manner\r\nthat the doctor and the nurse both noticed it.\r\n\r\nEvery nerve in her body felt that momentary pressure of his hand, with\r\nthe exquisite susceptibility which accompanies the first faltering\r\nadvance on the way to health. She looked at his changing color, she\r\nlistened to his hesitating words, with every sensitive perception of\r\nher sex and age quickened to seize intuitively on the truth. In the\r\nmoment when he looked away from her, she gently took her hand from him,\r\nand turned her head aside on the pillow. \xe2\x80\x9c_Can_ it be?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought,\r\nwith a flutter of delicious fear at her heart, with a glow of delicious\r\nconfusion burning on her cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9c_Can_ it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor made another sign to Kirke. He understood it, and rose\r\nimmediately. The momentary discomposure in his face and manner had both\r\ndisappeared. He was satisfied in his own mind that he had successfully\r\nkept his secret, and in the relief of feeling that conviction he had\r\nbecome himself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by till to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, softly, without looking at him.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrick took the chair which Kirke had resigned, and laid his hand\r\non her pulse. \xe2\x80\x9cJust what I feared,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9ctoo quick by\r\nhalf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe petulantly snatched away her wrist. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shrinking\r\nfrom him. \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t touch me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Merrick good-humoredly gave up his place to the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll return\r\nin half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cand carry her back to bed. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nher talk. Show her the pictures in the newspaper, and keep her quiet in\r\nthat way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor returned, the nurse reported that the newspaper had not\r\nbeen wanted. The patient\xe2\x80\x99s conduct had been exemplary. She had not been\r\nat all restless, and she had never spoken a word.\r\n\r\nThe days passed, and the time grew longer and longer which the doctor\r\nallowed her to spend in the front room. She was soon able to dispense\r\nwith the bed on the sofa\xe2\x80\x94she could be dressed, and could sit up,\r\nsupported by pillows, in an arm-chair. Her hours of emancipation from\r\nthe bedroom represented the great daily event of her life. They were\r\nthe hours she passed in Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s society.\r\n\r\nShe had a double interest in him now\xe2\x80\x94her interest in the man whose\r\nprotecting care had saved her reason and her life; her interest in the\r\nman whose heart\xe2\x80\x99s deepest secret she had surprised. Little by little\r\nthey grew as easy and familiar with each other as old friends; little\r\nby little she presumed on all her privileges, and wound her way\r\nunsuspected into the most intimate knowledge of his nature.\r\n\r\nHer questions were endless. Everything that he could tell her of\r\nhimself and his life she drew from him delicately and insensibly: he,\r\nthe least self-conscious of mankind, became an egotist in her dexterous\r\nhands. She found out his pride in his ship, and practiced on it without\r\nremorse. She drew him into talking of the fine qualities of the vessel,\r\nof the great things the vessel had done in emergencies, as he had never\r\nin his life talked yet to any living creature on shore. She found him\r\nout in private seafaring anxieties and unutterable seafaring\r\nexultations which he had kept a secret from his own mate. She watched\r\nhis kindling face with a delicious sense of triumph in adding fuel to\r\nthe fire; she trapped him into forgetting all considerations of time\r\nand place, and striking as hearty a stroke on the rickety little\r\nlodging-house table, in the fervor of his talk, as if his hand had\r\ndescended on the solid bulwark of his ship. His confusion at the\r\ndiscovery of his own forgetfulness secretly delighted her; she could\r\nhave cried with pleasure when he penitently wondered what he could\r\npossibly have been thinking of.\r\n\r\nAt other times she drew him from dwelling on the pleasures of his life,\r\nand led him into talking of its perils\xe2\x80\x94the perils of that jealous\r\nmistress the sea, which had absorbed so much of his existence, which\r\nhad kept him so strangely innocent and ignorant of the world on shore.\r\nTwice he had been shipwrecked. Times innumerable he and all with him\r\nhad been threatened with death, and had escaped their doom by the\r\nnarrowness of a hair-breadth. He was always unwilling at the outset to\r\nspeak of this dark and dreadful side of his life: it was only by\r\nadroitly tempting him, by laying little snares for him in his talk,\r\nthat she lured him into telling her of the terrors of the great deep.\r\nShe sat listening to him with a breathless interest, looking at him\r\nwith a breathless wonder, as those fearful stories\xe2\x80\x94made doubly vivid by\r\nthe simple language in which he told them\xe2\x80\x94fell, one by one, from his\r\nlips. His noble unconsciousness of his own heroism\xe2\x80\x94the artless modesty\r\nwith which he described his own acts of dauntless endurance and devoted\r\ncourage, without an idea that they were anything more than plain acts\r\nof duty to which he was bound by the vocation that he followed\xe2\x80\x94raised\r\nhim to a place in her estimation so hopelessly high above her that she\r\nbecame uneasy and impatient until she had pulled down the idol again\r\nwhich she herself had set up. It was on these occasions that she most\r\nrigidly exacted from him all those little familiar attentions so\r\nprecious to women in their intercourse with men. \xe2\x80\x9cThis hand,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, with an exquisite delight in secretly following the idea while\r\nhe was close to her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis hand that has rescued the drowning from death\r\nis shifting my pillows so tenderly that I hardly know when they are\r\nmoved. This hand that has seized men mad with mutiny, and driven them\r\nback to their duty by main force, is mixing my lemonade and peeling my\r\nfruit more delicately and more neatly than I could do it for myself.\r\nOh, if I could be a man, how I should like to be such a man as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe never allowed her thoughts, while she was in his presence, to lead\r\nher beyond that point. It was only when the night had separated them\r\nthat she ventured to let her mind dwell on the self-sacrificing\r\ndevotion which had so mercifully rescued her. Kirke little knew how she\r\nthought of him, in the secrecy of her own chamber, during the quiet\r\nhours that elapsed before she sank to sleep. No suspicion crossed his\r\nmind of the influence which he was exerting over her\xe2\x80\x94of the new spirit\r\nwhich he was breathing into that new life, so sensitively open to\r\nimpression in the first freshness of its recovered sense. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has\r\nnobody else to amuse her, poor thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to think, sadly, sitting\r\nalone in his small second-floor room. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a rough fellow like me can\r\nbeguile the weary hours till her friends come here, she is heartily\r\nwelcome to all that I can tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was out of spirits and restless now whenever he was by himself.\r\nLittle by little he fell into a habit of taking long, lonely walks at\r\nnight, when Magdalen thought he was sleeping upstairs. Once he went\r\naway abruptly in the day-time\xe2\x80\x94on business, as he said. Something had\r\npassed between Magdalen and himself the evening before which had led\r\nher into telling him her age. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty last birthday,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\ntwenty from forty-one. An easy sum in subtraction\xe2\x80\x94as easy a sum as my\r\nlittle nephew could wish for.\xe2\x80\x9d He walked to the Docks, and looked\r\nbitterly at the shipping. \xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget how a ship is made,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be long before I am back at the old work again.\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nleaving the Docks he paid a visit to a brother sailor\xe2\x80\x94a married man. In\r\nthe course of conversation he asked how much older his friend might be\r\nthan his friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife. There was six years\xe2\x80\x99 difference between them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s difference enough?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirke. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nfriend; \xe2\x80\x9cquite enough. Are you looking out for a wife at last? Try a\r\nseasoned woman of thirty-five\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s your mark, Kirke, as near as I can\r\ncalculate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time passed smoothly and quickly\xe2\x80\x94the present time, in which _she_\r\nwas recovering so happily\xe2\x80\x94the present time, which _he_ was beginning to\r\ndistrust already.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning Mr. Merrick surprised Kirke by a visit in his little\r\nroom on the second floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to the conclusion yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, entering\r\nabruptly on his business, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our patient was strong enough to\r\njustify us at last in running all risks, and communicating with her\r\nfriends; and I have accordingly followed the clue which that queer\r\nfellow, Captain Wragge, put into our hands. You remember he advised us\r\nto apply to Mr. Pendril, the lawyer? I saw Mr. Pendril two days ago,\r\nand was referred by him\xe2\x80\x94not overwillingly, as I thought\xe2\x80\x94to a lady named\r\nMiss Garth. I heard enough from her to satisfy me that we have\r\nexercised a wise caution in acting as we have done. It is a very, very\r\nsad story; and I am bound to say that I, for one, make great allowances\r\nfor the poor girl downstairs. Her only relation in the world is her\r\nelder sister. I have suggested that the sister shall write to her in\r\nthe first instance, and then, if the letter does her no harm, follow it\r\npersonally in a day or two. I have not given the address, by way of\r\npreventing any visits from being paid here without my permission. All I\r\nhave done is to undertake to forward the letter, and I shall probably\r\nfind it at my house when I get back. Can you stop at home until I send\r\nmy man with it? There is not the least hope of my being able to bring\r\nit myself. All you need do is to watch for an opportunity when she is\r\nnot in the front room, and to put the letter where she can see it when\r\nshe comes in. The handwriting on the address will break the news before\r\nshe opens the letter. Say nothing to her about it\xe2\x80\x94take care that the\r\nlandlady is within call\xe2\x80\x94and leave her to herself. I know I can trust\r\n_you_ to follow my directions, and that is why I ask you to do us this\r\nservice. You look out of spirits this morning. Natural enough. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nused to plenty of fresh air, captain, and you\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to pine in\r\nthis close place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask a question, doctor? Is _she_ pining in this close place,\r\ntoo? When her sister comes, will her sister take her away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, if my advice is followed. She will be well enough to be\r\nmoved in a week or less. Good-day. You are certainly out of spirits,\r\nand your hand feels feverish. Pining for the blue water, captain\xe2\x80\x94pining\r\nfor the blue water!\xe2\x80\x9d With that expression of opinion, the doctor\r\ncheerfully went out.\r\n\r\nIn an hour the letter arrived. Kirke took it from the landlady\r\nreluctantly, and almost roughly, without looking at it. Having\r\nascertained that Magdalen was still engaged at her toilet, and having\r\nexplained to the landlady the necessity of remaining within call, he\r\nwent downstairs immediately, and put the letter on the table in the\r\nfront room. Magdalen heard the sound of the familiar step on the floor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon be ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she called to him, through the door.\r\n\r\nHe made no reply; he took his hat and went out. After a momentary\r\nhesitation, he turned his face eastward, and called on the ship-owners\r\nwho employed him, at their office in Cornhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s first glance round the empty room showed her the letter on\r\nthe table. The address, as the doctor had predicted, broke the news the\r\nmoment she looked at it.\r\n\r\nNot a word escaped her. She sat down by the table, pale and silent,\r\nwith the letter in her lap. Twice she attempted to open it, and twice\r\nshe put it back again. The bygone time was not alone in her mind as she\r\nlooked at her sister\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting: the fear of Kirke was there with\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cMy past life!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will he think of me when he\r\nknows my past life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made another effort, and broke the seal. A second letter dropped\r\nout of the inclosure, addressed to her in a handwriting with which she\r\nwas not familiar. She put the second letter aside and read the lines\r\nwhich Norah had written:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVentnor, Isle of Wight, August 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAREST MAGDALEN,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you read this letter, try to think we have only been parted since\r\nyesterday; and dismiss from your mind (as I have dismissed from mine)\r\nthe past and all that belongs to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am strictly forbidden to agitate you, or to weary you by writing a\r\nlong letter. Is it wrong to tell you that I am the happiest woman\r\nliving? I hope not, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep the secret to myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, prepare yourself for the greatest surprise I have ever\r\ncaused you. I am married. It is only a week to-day since I parted with\r\nmy old name\xe2\x80\x94it is only a week since I have been the happy wife of\r\nGeorge Bartram, of St. Crux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were difficulties at first in the way of our marriage, some of\r\nthem, I am afraid, of my making. Happily for me, my husband knew from\r\nthe beginning that I really loved him: he gave me a second chance of\r\ntelling him so, after I had lost the first, and, as you see, I was wise\r\nenough to take it. You ought to be especially interested, my love, in\r\nthis marriage, for you are the cause of it. If I had not gone to\r\nAldborough to search for the lost trace of you\xe2\x80\x94if George had not been\r\nbrought there at the same time by circumstances in which you were\r\nconcerned, my husband and I might never have met. When we look back to\r\nour first impressions of each other, we look back to _you_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must keep my promise not to weary you; I must bring this letter\r\n(sorely against my will) to an end. Patience! patience! I shall see you\r\nsoon. George and I are both coming to London to take you back with us\r\nto Ventnor. This is my husband\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, mind, as well as mine.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I married him, Magdalen, until I had taught him to think\r\nof you as I think\xe2\x80\x94to wish with my wishes, and to hope with my hopes. I\r\ncould say so much more about this, so much more about George, if I\r\nmight only give my thoughts and my pen their own way; but I must leave\r\nMiss Garth (at her own special request) a blank space to fill up on the\r\nlast page of this letter; and I must only add one word more before I\r\nsay good-by\xe2\x80\x94a word to warn you that I have another surprise in store,\r\nwhich I am keeping in reserve until we meet. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to guess\r\nwhat it is. You might guess for ages, and be no nearer than you are now\r\nto the discovery of the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affectionate sister,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNORAH BARTRAM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n(Added by Miss Garth.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR CHILD,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had ever lost my old loving recollection of you, I should feel it\r\nin my heart again now, when I know that it has pleased God to restore\r\nyou to us from the brink of the grave. I add these lines to your\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s letter because I am not sure that you are quite so fit yet, as\r\nshe thinks you, to accept her proposal. She has not said a word of her\r\nhusband or herself which is not true. But Mr. Bartram is a stranger to\r\nyou; and if you think you can recover more easily and more pleasantly\r\nto yourself under the wing of your old governess than under the\r\nprotection of your new brother-in-law, come to me first, and trust to\r\nmy reconciling Norah to the change of plans. I have secured the refusal\r\nof a little cottage at Shanklin, near enough to your sister to allow of\r\nyour seeing each other whenever you like, and far enough away, at the\r\nsame time, to secure you the privilege, when you wish it, of being\r\nalone. Send me one line before we meet to say Yes or No, and I will\r\nwrite to Shanklin by the next post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways yours affectionately,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHARRIET GARTH\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter dropped from Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Thoughts which had never risen\r\nin her mind yet rose in it now.\r\n\r\nNorah, whose courage under undeserved calamity had been the courage of\r\nresignation\xe2\x80\x94Norah, who had patiently accepted her hard lot; who from\r\nfirst to last had meditated no vengeance and stooped to no deceit\xe2\x80\x94Norah\r\nhad reached the end which all her sister\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity, all her sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution, and all her sister\xe2\x80\x99s daring had failed to achieve. Openly\r\nand honorably, with love on one side and love on the other, Norah had\r\nmarried the man who possessed the Combe-Raven money\xe2\x80\x94and Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nscheme to recover it had opened the way to the event which had brought\r\nhusband and wife together.\r\n\r\nAs the light of that overwhelming discovery broke on her mind, the old\r\nstrife was renewed; and Good and Evil struggled once more which should\r\nwin her\xe2\x80\x94but with added forces this time; with the new spirit that had\r\nbeen breathed into her new life; with the nobler sense that had grown\r\nwith the growth of her gratitude to the man who had saved her, fighting\r\non the better side. All the higher impulses of her nature, which had\r\nnever, from first to last, let her err with impunity\xe2\x80\x94which had tortured\r\nher, before her marriage and after it, with the remorse that no woman\r\ninherently heartless and inherently wicked can feel\xe2\x80\x94all the nobler\r\nelements in her character, gathered their forces for the crowning\r\nstruggle and strengthened her to meet, with no unworthy shrinking, the\r\nrevelation that had opened on her view. Clearer and clearer, in the\r\nlight of its own immortal life, the truth rose before her from the\r\nashes of her dead passions, from the grave of her buried hopes. When\r\nshe looked at the letter again\xe2\x80\x94when she read the words once more which\r\ntold her that the recovery of the lost fortune was her sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntriumph, not hers, she had victoriously trampled down all little\r\njealousies and all mean regrets; she could say in her hearts of hearts,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorah has deserved it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day wore on. She sat absorbed in her own thoughts, and heedless of\r\nthe second letter which she had not opened yet, until Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nHe stopped on the landing outside, and, opening the door a little way\r\nonly, asked, without entering the room, if she wanted anything that he\r\ncould send her. She begged him to come in. His face was worn and weary;\r\nhe looked older than she had seen him look yet. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you put my letter\r\non the table for me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I put it there at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s request.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the doctor told you it was from my sister? She is coming to\r\nsee me, and Miss Garth is coming to see me. They will thank you for all\r\nyour goodness to me better than I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no claim on their thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have\r\ndone was not done for them, but for you.\xe2\x80\x9d He waited a little, and\r\nlooked at her. His face would have betrayed him in that look, his voice\r\nwould have betrayed him in the next words he spoke, if she had not\r\nguessed the truth already. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen your friends come here,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey will take you away, I suppose, to some better place than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can take me to no place,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I shall think\r\nof as I think of the place where you found me. They can take me to no\r\ndearer friend than the friend who saved my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been very happy here,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, in lower and lower tones.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t forget me when we have said good-by?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned pale as the words passed his lips, and, leaving her chair,\r\nknelt down at the table, so as to look up into his face, and to force\r\nhim to look into hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you talk of it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not going to say good-by,\r\nat least not yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought your friends were coming here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe eagerly interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I would go away with\r\nanybody,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ceven with the dearest relation I have in the\r\nworld, and leave you here, not knowing and not caring whether I ever\r\nsaw you again? Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that of me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with the\r\npassionate tears springing into her eyes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\r\nof me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI never have thought, I never can think, unjustly or\r\nunworthily of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he could add another word she left the table as suddenly as she\r\nhad approached it, and returned to her chair. He had unconsciously\r\nreplied in terms that reminded her of the hard necessity which still\r\nremained unfulfilled\xe2\x80\x94the necessity of telling him the story of the\r\npast. Not an idea of concealing that story from his knowledge crossed\r\nher mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWill he love me, when he knows the truth, as he loves me\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d That was her only thought as she tried to approach the subject in\r\nhis presence without shrinking from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us put my own feelings out of the question,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a\r\nreason for my not going away, unless I first have the assurance of\r\nseeing you again. You have a claim\xe2\x80\x94the strongest claim of any one\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nknow how I came here, unknown to my friends, and how it was that you\r\nfound me fallen so low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make no claim,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know nothing which\r\ndistresses you to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have always done your duty,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, with a faint smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me take example from you, if I can, and try to do mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am old enough to be your father,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cDuty is more\r\neasily done at my age than it is at yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis age was so constantly in his mind now that he fancied it must be in\r\nher mind too. She had never given it a thought. The reference he had\r\njust made to it did not divert her for a moment from the subject on\r\nwhich she was speaking to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I value your good opinion of me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nstruggling resolutely to sustain her sinking courage. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I\r\ndeserve your kindness, how can I feel that I am worthy of your regard,\r\nuntil I have opened my heart to you? Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t encourage me in my own\r\nmiserable weakness! Help me to tell the truth\xe2\x80\x94_force_ me to tell it,\r\nfor my own sake if not for yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was deeply moved by the fervent sincerity of that appeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _shall_ tell it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are right\xe2\x80\x94and I was wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwaited a little, and considered. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it be easier to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nwith delicate consideration for her, \xe2\x80\x9cto write it than to tell it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe caught gratefully at the suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cFar easier,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan be sure of myself\xe2\x80\x94I can be sure of hiding nothing from you, if I\r\nwrite it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t write to me on your side!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, suddenly, seeing\r\nwith a woman\xe2\x80\x99s instinctive quickness of penetration the danger of\r\ntotally renouncing her personal influence over him. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till we meet,\r\nand tell me with your own lips what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall I tell it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d she said eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, where you found me helpless\xe2\x80\x94here,\r\nwhere you have brought me back to life, and where I have first learned\r\nto know you. I can bear the hardest words you say to me if you will\r\nonly say them in this room. It is impossible I can be away longer than\r\na month; a month will be enough and more than enough. If I come back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe stopped confusedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I\r\nought to be thinking of you. You have your own occupations and your own\r\nfriends. Will you decide for us? Will you say how it shall be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be as you wish. If you come back in a month, you will find me\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it cause you no sacrifice of your own comfort and your own\r\nplans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will cause me nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a journey back to the\r\nCity.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose and took his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go there at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor I shall not be in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a promise between us?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, a little sadly; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlight as it was, the shade of melancholy in his manner pained her.\r\nForgetting all other anxieties in the anxiety to cheer him, she gently\r\npressed the hand he gave her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf _that_ won\xe2\x80\x99t tell him the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt failed to tell him the truth; but it forced a question on his mind\r\nwhich he had not ventured to ask himself before. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it her gratitude,\r\nor her love; that is speaking to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was only a\r\nyounger man, I might almost hope it was her love.\xe2\x80\x9d That terrible sum in\r\nsubtraction which had first presented itself on the day when she told\r\nhim her age began to trouble him again as he left the house. He took\r\ntwenty from forty-one, at intervals, all the way back to the\r\nship-owners\xe2\x80\x99 office in Cornhill.\r\n\r\nLeft by herself, Magdalen approached the table to write the line of\r\nanswer which Miss Garth requested, and gratefully to accept the\r\nproposal that had been made to her.\r\n\r\nThe second letter which she had laid aside and forgotten was the first\r\nobject that caught her eye on changing her place. She opened it\r\nimmediately, and, not recognizing the handwriting, looked at the\r\nsignature. To her unutterable astonishment, her correspondent proved to\r\nbe no less a person than\xe2\x80\x94old Mr. Clare!\r\n\r\nThe philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s letter dispensed with all the ordinary forms of\r\naddress, and entered on the subject without prefatory phrases of any\r\nkind, in these uncompromising terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have more news for you of that contemptible cur, my son. Here it is\r\nin the fewest possible words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always told you, if you remember, that Frank was a Sneak. The very\r\nfirst trace recovered of him, after his running away from his employers\r\nin China, presents him in that character. Where do you think he turns\r\nup next? He turns up, hidden behind a couple of flour barrels, on board\r\nan English vessel bound homeward from Hong-Kong to London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name of the ship was the _Deliverance_, and the commander was one\r\nCaptain Kirke. Instead of acting like a sensible man, and throwing\r\nFrank overboard, Captain Kirke was fool enough to listen to his story.\r\nHe made the most of his misfortunes, you may be sure. He was half\r\nstarved; he was an Englishman lost in a strange country, without a\r\nfriend to help him; his only chance of getting home was to sneak into\r\nthe hold of an English vessel\xe2\x80\x94and he had sneaked in, accordingly, at\r\nHong-Kong, two days since. That was his story. Any other lout in\r\nFrank\xe2\x80\x99s situation would have been rope\xe2\x80\x99s ended by any other captain.\r\nDeserving no pity from anybody, Frank was, as a matter of course,\r\ncoddled and compassionated on the spot. The captain took him by the\r\nhand, the crew pitied him, and the passengers patted him on the back.\r\nHe was fed, clothed, and presented with his passage home. Luck enough\r\nso far, you will say. Nothing of the sort; nothing like luck enough for\r\nmy despicable son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ship touched at the Cape of Good Hope. Among his other acts of\r\nfolly Captain Kirke took a woman passenger on board at that place\xe2\x80\x94not a\r\nyoung woman by any means\xe2\x80\x94the elderly widow of a rich colonist. Is it\r\nnecessary to say that she forthwith became deeply interested in Frank\r\nand his misfortunes? Is it necessary to tell you what followed? Look\r\nback at my son\xe2\x80\x99s career, and you will see that what followed was all of\r\na piece with what went before. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve your poor father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest in him\xe2\x80\x94and he got it. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve your attachment\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\ngot it. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve the best place in one of the best offices in\r\nLondon; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve an equally good chance in one of the best\r\nmercantile houses in China; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve food, clothing, pity, and\r\na free passage home\xe2\x80\x94and he got them all. Last, not least, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven deserve to marry a woman old enough to be his grandmother\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\nhas done it! Not five minutes since I sent his wedding-cards out to the\r\ndust-hole, and tossed the letter that came with them into the fire. The\r\nlast piece of information which that letter contains is that he and his\r\nwife are looking out for a house and estate to suit them. Mark my\r\nwords! Frank will get one of the best estates in England; a seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons will follow as a matter of course; and one of the\r\nlegislators of this Ass-ridden country will be\xe2\x80\x94MY LOUT!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are the sensible girl I have always taken you for, you have\r\nlong since learned to rate Frank at his true value, and the news I send\r\nyou will only confirm your contempt for him. I wish your poor father\r\ncould but have lived to see this day! Often as I have missed my old\r\ngossip, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I ever felt the loss of him so keenly as I\r\nfelt it when Frank\xe2\x80\x99s wedding-cards and Frank\xe2\x80\x99s letter came to this\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend, if you ever want one,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFRANCIS CLARE, Sen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWith one momentary disturbance of her composure, produced by the\r\nappearance of Kirke\xe2\x80\x99s name in Mr. Clare\xe2\x80\x99s singular narrative, Magdalen\r\nread the letter steadily through from beginning to end. The time when\r\nit could have distressed her was gone by; the scales had long since\r\nfallen from her eyes. Mr. Clare himself would have been satisfied if he\r\nhad seen the quiet contempt on her face as she laid aside his letter.\r\nThe only serious thought it cost her was a thought in which Kirke was\r\nconcerned. The careless manner in which he had referred in her presence\r\nto the passengers on board his ship, without mentioning any of them by\r\ntheir names, showed her that Frank must have kept silence on the\r\nsubject of the engagement once existing between them. The confession of\r\nthat vanished delusion was left for her to make, as part of the story\r\nof the past which she had pledged herself unreservedly to reveal.\r\n\r\nShe wrote to Miss Garth, and sent the letter to the post immediately.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought a line of rejoinder. Miss Garth had written to\r\nsecure the cottage at Shanklin, and Mr. Merrick had consented to\r\nMagdalen\xe2\x80\x99s removal on the following day. Norah would be the first to\r\narrive at the house; and Miss Garth would follow, with a comfortable\r\ncarriage to take the invalid to the railway. Every needful arrangement\r\nhad been made for her; the effort of moving was the one effort she\r\nwould have to make.\r\n\r\nMagdalen read the letter thankfully, but her thoughts wandered from it,\r\nand followed Kirke on his return to the City. What was the business\r\nwhich had once already taken him there in the morning? And why had the\r\npromise exchanged between them obliged him to go to the City again, for\r\nthe second time in one day?\r\n\r\nWas it by any chance business relating to the sea? Were his employers\r\ntempting him to go back to his ship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe first agitation of the meeting between the sisters was over; the\r\nfirst vivid impressions, half pleasurable, half painful, had softened a\r\nlittle, and Norah and Magdalen sat together hand in hand, each rapt in\r\nthe silent fullness of her own joy. Magdalen was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have something to tell me, Norah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a thousand things to tell you, my love; and you have ten\r\nthousand things to tell me.\xe2\x80\x94Do you mean that second surprise which I\r\ntold you of in my letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I suppose it must concern me very nearly, or you would hardly\r\nhave thought of mentioning it in your first letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does concern you very nearly. You have heard of George\xe2\x80\x99s house in\r\nEssex? You must be familiar, at least, with the name of St. Crux?\xe2\x80\x94What\r\nis there to start at, my dear? I am afraid you are hardly strong enough\r\nfor any more surprises just yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite strong enough, Norah. I have something to say to you about St.\r\nCrux\xe2\x80\x94I have a surprise, on my side, for _you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell it me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now. You shall know it when we are at the seaside; you shall know\r\nit before I accept the kindness which has invited me to your husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _can_ it be? Why not tell me at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used often to set me the example of patience, Norah, in old times;\r\nwill you set me the example now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart. Shall I return to my own story as well? Yes? Then\r\nwe will go back to it at once. I was telling you that St. Crux is\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s house, in Essex, the house he inherited from his uncle.\r\nKnowing that Miss Garth had a curiosity to see the place, he left word\r\n(when he went abroad after the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s death) that she and any\r\nfriends who came with her were to be admitted, if she happened to find\r\nherself in the neighborhood during his absence. Miss Garth and I, and a\r\nlarge party of Mr. Tyrrel\xe2\x80\x99s friends, found ourselves in the\r\nneighborhood not long after George\xe2\x80\x99s departure. We had all been invited\r\nto see the launch of Mr. Tyrrel\xe2\x80\x99s new yacht from the builder\xe2\x80\x99s yard at\r\nWivenhoe, in Essex. When the launch was over, the rest of the company\r\nreturned to Colchester to dine. Miss Garth and I contrived to get into\r\nthe same carriage together, with nobody but my two little pupils for\r\nour companions. We gave the coachman his orders, and drove round by St.\r\nCrux. The moment Miss Garth mentioned her name we were let in, and\r\nshown all over the house. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to describe it to you. It is\r\nthe most bewildering place I ever saw in my life\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to describe it, Norah. Go on with your story instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. My story takes me straight into one of the rooms at St.\r\nCrux\xe2\x80\x94a room about as long as your street here\xe2\x80\x94so dreary, so dirty, and\r\nso dreadfully cold that I shiver at the bare recollection of it. Miss\r\nGarth was for getting out of it again as speedily as possible, and so\r\nwas I. But the housekeeper declined to let us off without first looking\r\nat a singular piece of furniture, the only piece of furniture in the\r\ncomfortless place. She called it a tripod, I think. (There is nothing\r\nto be alarmed at, Magdalen; I assure you there is nothing to be alarmed\r\nat!) At any rate, it was a strange, three-legged thing, which supported\r\na great panful of charcoal ashes at the top. It was considered by all\r\ngood judges (the housekeeper told us) a wonderful piece of chasing in\r\nmetal; and she especially pointed out the beauty of some scroll-work\r\nrunning round the inside of the pan, with Latin mottoes on it,\r\nsignifying\xe2\x80\x94I forget what. I felt not the slightest interest in the\r\nthing myself, but I looked close at the scroll-work to satisfy the\r\nhousekeeper. To confess the truth, she was rather tiresome with her\r\nmechanically learned lecture on fine metal work; and, while she was\r\ntalking, I found myself idly stirring the soft feathery white ashes\r\nbackward and forward with my hand, pretending to listen, with my mind a\r\nhundred miles away from her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long or how short a time\r\nI had been playing with the ashes, when my fingers suddenly encountered\r\na piece of crumpled paper hidden deep among them. When I brought it to\r\nthe surface, it proved to be a letter\xe2\x80\x94a long letter full of cramped,\r\nclose writing.\xe2\x80\x94You have anticipated my story, Magdalen, before I can\r\nend it! You know as well as I do that the letter which my idle fingers\r\nfound was the Secret Trust. Hold out your hand, my dear. I have got\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s permission to show it to you, and there it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put the Trust into her sister\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Magdalen took it from her\r\nmechanically. \xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at her sister with the\r\nremembrance of all that she had vainly ventured, of all that she had\r\nvainly suffered, at St. Crux\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_you_ have found it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norah, gayly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Trust has proved no exception to the\r\ngeneral perversity of all lost things. Look for them, and they remain\r\ninvisible. Leave them alone, and they reveal themselves! You and your\r\nlawyer, Magdalen, were both justified in supposing that your interest\r\nin this discovery was an interest of no common kind. I spare you all\r\nour consultations after I had produced the crumpled paper from the\r\nashes. It ended in George\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer being written to, and in George\r\nhimself being recalled from the Continent. Miss Garth and I both saw\r\nhim immediately on his return. He did what neither of us could do\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nsolved the mystery of the Trust being hidden in the charcoal ashes.\r\nAdmiral Bartram, you must know, was all his life subject to fits of\r\nsomnambulism. He had been found walking in his sleep not long before\r\nhis death\xe2\x80\x94just at the time, too, when he was sadly troubled in his mind\r\non the subject of that very letter in your hand. George\xe2\x80\x99s idea is that\r\nhe must have fancied he was doing in his sleep what he would have died\r\nrather than do in his waking moments\xe2\x80\x94destroying the Trust. The fire had\r\nbeen lighted in the pan not long before, and he no doubt saw it still\r\nburning in his dream. This was George\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the strange\r\nposition of the letter when I discovered it. The question of what was\r\nto be done with the letter itself came next, and was no easy question\r\nfor a woman to understand. But I determined to master it, and I did\r\nmaster it, because it related to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me try to master it, in my turn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\nparticular reason for wishing to know as much about this letter as you\r\nknow yourself. What has it done for others, and what is it to do for\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Magdalen, how strangely you look at it! how strangely you talk\r\nof it! Worthless as it may appear, that morsel of paper gives you a\r\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my only claim to the fortune the claim which this letter gives me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; the letter is your only claim. Shall I try if I can explain it in\r\ntwo words? Taken by itself, the letter might, in the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion,\r\nhave been made a matter for dispute, though I am sure George would have\r\nsanctioned no proceeding of that sort. Taken, however, with the\r\npostscript which Admiral Bartram attached to it (you will see the lines\r\nif you look under the signature on the third page), it becomes legally\r\nbinding, as well as morally binding, on the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s representatives.\r\nI have exhausted my small stock of legal words, and must go on in my\r\nown language instead of in the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s. The end of the thing was\r\nsimply this. All the money went back to Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s estate\r\n(another legal word! my vocabulary is richer than I thought), for one\r\nplain reason\xe2\x80\x94that it had not been employed as Mr. Noel Vanstone\r\ndirected. If Mrs. Girdlestone had lived, or if George had married me a\r\nfew months earlier, results would have been just the other way. As it\r\nis, half the money has been already divided between Mr. Noel Vanstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnext of kin; which means, translated into plain English, my husband,\r\nand his poor bedridden sister\xe2\x80\x94who took the money formally, one day, to\r\nsatisfy the lawyer, and who gave it back again generously, the next, to\r\nsatisfy herself. So much for one half of this legacy. The other half,\r\nmy dear, is all yours. How strangely events happen, Magdalen! It is\r\nonly two years since you and I were left disinherited orphans\xe2\x80\x94and we\r\nare sharing our poor father\xe2\x80\x99s fortune between us, after all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, Norah. Our shares come to us in very different ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they? Mine comes to me by my husband. Yours comes to you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstopped confusedly, and changed color. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, my own love!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, putting Magdalen\xe2\x80\x99s hand to her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI have forgotten what I\r\nought to have remembered. I have thoughtlessly distressed you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magdalen; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have encouraged me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEncouraged you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, she rose quietly from the sofa, and walked to the\r\nopen window. Before Norah could follow her, she had torn the Trust to\r\npieces, and had cast the fragments into the street.\r\n\r\nShe came back to the sofa and laid her head, with a deep sigh of\r\nrelief, on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cI will owe nothing to my past life,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI have parted with it as I have parted with those torn morsels\r\nof paper. All the thoughts and all the hopes belonging to it are put\r\naway from me forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagdalen, my husband will never allow you! I will never allow you\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush! What your husband thinks right, Norah, you and I will\r\nthink right too. I will take from _you_ what I would never have taken\r\nif that letter had given it to me. The end I dreamed of has come.\r\nNothing is changed but the position I once thought we might hold toward\r\neach other. Better as it is, my love\xe2\x80\x94far, far better as it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she made the last sacrifice of the old perversity and the old pride.\r\nSo she entered on the new and nobler life.\r\n\r\n\r\nA month had passed. The autumn sunshine was bright even in the murky\r\nstreets, and the clocks in the neighborhood were just striking two, as\r\nMagdalen returned alone to the house in Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s Buildings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he waiting for me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, anxiously, when the landlady let her\r\nin.\r\n\r\nHe was waiting in the front room. Magdalen stole up the stairs and\r\nknocked at the door. He called to her carelessly and absently to come\r\nin, plainly thinking that it was only the servant who applied for\r\npermission to enter the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hardly expected me so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d she said speaking on the threshold,\r\nand pausing there to enjoy his surprise as he started to his feet and\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\nThe only traces of illness still visible in her face left a delicacy in\r\nits outline which added refinement to her beauty. She was simply\r\ndressed in muslin. Her plain straw bonnet had no other ornament than\r\nthe white ribbon with which it was sparingly trimmed. She had never\r\nlooked lovelier in her best days than she looked now, as she advanced\r\nto the table at which he had been sitting, with a little basket of\r\nflowers that she had brought with her from the country, and offered him\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nHe looked anxious and careworn when she saw him closer. She interrupted\r\nhis first inquiries and congratulations to ask if he had remained in\r\nLondon since they had parted\xe2\x80\x94if he had not even gone away, for a few\r\ndays only, to see his friends in Suffolk? No; he had been in London\r\never since. He never told her that the pretty parsonage house in\r\nSuffolk wanted all those associations with herself in which the poor\r\nfour walls at Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s Buildings were so rich. He only said he had been\r\nin London ever since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, looking him attentively in the face, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are\r\nas happy to see me again as I am to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am even happier, in my different way,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nShe took off her bonnet and scarf, and seated herself once more in her\r\nown arm-chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose this street is very ugly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nam sure nobody can deny that the house is very small. And yet\xe2\x80\x94and yet\r\nit feels like coming home again. Sit there where you used to sit; tell\r\nme about yourself. I want to know all that you have done, all that you\r\nhave thought even, while I have been away.\xe2\x80\x9d She tried to resume the\r\nendless succession of questions by means of which she was accustomed to\r\nlure him into speaking of himself. But she put them far less\r\nspontaneously, far less adroitly, than usual. Her one all-absorbing\r\nanxiety in entering that room was not an anxiety to be trifled with.\r\nAfter a quarter of an hour wasted in constrained inquiries on one side,\r\nin reluctant replies on the other, she ventured near the dangerous\r\nsubject at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you received the letters I wrote to you from the seaside?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, suddenly looking away from him for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one of them\xe2\x80\x94many times over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer heart beat as if it would suffocate her. She had kept her promise\r\nbravely. The whole story of her life, from the time of the home-wreck\r\nat Combe-Raven to the time when she had destroyed the Secret Trust in\r\nher sister\xe2\x80\x99s presence, had been all laid before him. Nothing that she\r\nhad done, nothing even that she had thought, had been concealed from\r\nhis knowledge. As he would have kept a pledged engagement with her, so\r\nshe had kept her pledged engagement with him. She had not faltered in\r\nthe resolution to do this; and now she faltered over the one decisive\r\nquestion which she had come there to ask. Strong as the desire in her\r\nwas to know if she had lost or won him, the fear of knowing was at that\r\nmoment stronger still. She waited and trembled; she waited, and said no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I speak to you about your letters?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I tell you\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf she had looked at him as he said those few words, she would have\r\nseen what he thought of her in his face. She would have seen, innocent\r\nas he was in this world\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, that he knew the priceless value,\r\nthe all-ennobling virtue, of a woman who speaks the truth. But she had\r\nno courage to look at him\xe2\x80\x94no courage to raise her eyes from her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot just yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite so soon after we have met\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose hurriedly from her chair, and walked to the window, turned\r\nback again into the room, and approached the table, close to where he\r\nwas sitting. The writing materials scattered near him offered her a\r\npretext for changing the subject, and she seized on it directly. \xe2\x80\x9cWere\r\nyou writing a letter,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a letter to be\r\nwritten without thinking first.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose as he answered her to gather\r\nthe writing materials together and put them away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I interrupt you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not let me try whether I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help you instead? Is it a secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated as he answered her. She instantly guessed the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it about your ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe little knew how she had been thinking in her absence from him of the\r\nbusiness which he believed that he had concealed from her. He little\r\nknew that she had learned already to be jealous of his ship. \xe2\x80\x9cDo they\r\nwant you to return to your old life?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cDo they want you to\r\ngo back to the sea? Must you say Yes or No at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had not come in when I did would you have said Yes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe unconsciously laid her hand on his arm, forgetting all inferior\r\nconsiderations in her breathless anxiety to hear his next words. The\r\nconfession of his love was within a hair-breadth of escaping him; but\r\nhe checked the utterance of it even yet. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought; \xe2\x80\x9cbut how can I be certain of not distressing _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have said Yes?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was doubting,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI was doubting between Yes and No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand tightened on his arm; a sudden trembling seized her in every\r\nlimb, she could bear it no longer. All her heart went out to him in her\r\nnext words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you doubting _for my sake?\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my confession in return for yours\xe2\x80\x94I was doubting\r\nfor your sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said no more; she only looked at him. In that look the truth\r\nreached him at last. The next instant she was folded in his arms, and\r\nwas shedding delicious tears of joy, with her face hidden on his bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I deserve my happiness?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, asking the one question at\r\nlast. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know how the poor narrow people who have never felt and\r\nnever suffered would answer me if I asked them what I ask you. If\r\n_they_ knew my story, they would forget all the provocation, and only\r\nremember the offense; they would fasten on my sin, and pass all my\r\nsuffering by. But you are not one of them! Tell me if you have any\r\nshadow of a misgiving! Tell me if you doubt that the one dear object of\r\nall my life to come is to live worthy of you! I asked you to wait and\r\nsee me; I asked you, if there was any hard truth to be told, to tell it\r\nme here with your own lips. Tell it, my love, my husband!\xe2\x80\x94tell it me\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up, still clinging to him as she clung to the hope of her\r\nbetter life to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my own lips?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cSay what you think of me with your own\r\nlips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of No Name, by Wilkie Collins\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NO NAME ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1438-0.txt or 1438-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/3/1438/\r\n\r\nProduced by James Rusk and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
